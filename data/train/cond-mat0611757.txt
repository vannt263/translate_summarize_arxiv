    "synchronization in populations of phase - coupled nonlinear stochastic oscillators , and the corresponding emergence of macroscopic coherence , appear pervasively in a tremendous range of physical , chemical , and biological systems . as a result , the general subject continues to be studied intensely in applied mathematics and theoretical physics  @xcite . since the pioneering work of kuramoto  @xcite , emergent cooperation in these systems has been investigated from a myriad of perspectives encompassing both globally and locally coupled , stochastic and deterministic , and large and small systems . and while kuramoto s canonical model of nonlinear oscillators , whose use is widespread because of its close kinship to the normal form describing general phase oscillations , has proven spectacularly successful for characterizing synchronization , simple , phenomenological models of synchronization have also proven useful in a variety of new contexts  @xcite , most notably the characterization of emergent synchronization as a nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that a model of three - state identical phase - coupled stochastic oscillators is ideally suited for studying the nonequilibrium phase transition to synchrony in locally - coupled systems , owing in large part to its numerical simplicity .",
    "the utility of these studies rests on the well - established notion of universality , that is , on the contention that microscopic details do not determine the universal properties associated with the breaking of time - translational symmetry that leads to a macroscopic phase transition .",
    "statistical mechanics is thus enriched by simplistic , phenomenological models ( the ising model being the most ubiquitous example ) whose microscopic specifics are known to be , at best , substantial simplifications of the underlying quantum mechanical nature of matter , but whose critical behavior captures that of more complex real systems . in this spirit , our simple tractable model captures the principal features of the syncrhonization of phase - coupled oscillators . in the globally coupled ( mean field ) case our model undergoes a supercritical hopf bifurcation . with nearest neighbor coupling",
    ", we have shown that the array undergoes a continuous phase transition to macroscopic synchronization marked by signatures of the @xmath4 universality class  @xcite , including the appropriate classical exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and lower and upper critical dimensions @xmath7 and @xmath3 respectively .    in this paper",
    "we focus on globally coupled arrays and expand our earlier studies to the arena of transition rate disorder .",
    "we start with a slightly modified version of our original model ( explained below ) , in which identical synchronized units are governed by the same transition rates as individual uncoupled units .",
    "then , in the spirit of the original kuramoto problem  @xcite , we explore the occurrence of synchronization when there is more than one transition rate and perhaps even a distribution of transition rates among the phase - coupled oscillators .",
    "in particular , we explore the conditions ( if any ) that lead to a synchronization transition in the face of a transition rate distribution , discuss the relation between the frequency of oscillation of the synchronized array and the transition rates of individual units , and explore whether or not the existence of units of different transition rates in the coupled array may lead to more than one phase transition .",

    "[ sec3 ] we present results for a dimer composed of two units of different intrinsic transition rates . while there is of course no phase transition in this system , it is instructive to note that there is a probability of sychronization of the two units that increases with increasing coupling strength .",

    "we pay particular attention to the dichotomous case , @xmath1 .",
    "this simple disordered system reveals some important general signatures of synchronization .",
    "we also consider the cases @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but find that the @xmath1 case already exhibits most of the interesting qualitative consequences of a distribution of transition rates . in particular , we are able to infer the important roles of the mean and variance of the distribution . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we generalize further to a uniform finite - width distribution of transition rates and explore this inference in more detail .",

    "our previous work used a slightly different form of the coupling  ( [ gnu ] ) , with @xmath36 . while the differences in these details do not in any way affect the characterization of the synchronization transitions , that earlier choice was numerically advantageous because it led to a phase transition at a lower critical value @xmath37 of the coupling constant ( @xmath38 in the globally coupled array ) than other choices .",
    "a lower coupling in turn facilitates numerical integration of equations of motion because the time step that one needs to use near the phase transition must be sufficiently small , @xmath39 .",
    "however , that earlier coupling choice brought with it a result that is undesirable in our present context ( but was of no consequence before ) . in our earlier model , as the units become increasingly synchronized above the transition point , the average transition rate of a cluster becomes substantially dependent on the value of @xmath13 ; specifically , the transitions and cluster oscillation frequency slow as @xmath13 is increased due to an exponential decrease in the transition probability . to cite an explicit example ,",
    "consider a small subsystem composed of units which are all in the same state at time @xmath19 ( that is , a cluster of units which are perfectly synchronized ) .",
    "the previous form of the coupling yields an exponentially small transition rate in this case , and hence the oscillation frequency of this microscopic cluster approaches zero for high values of @xmath13 .",
    "since here we specifically wish to analyze the effects of transition rate disorder , it is desirable to deal with a model in which the average transition rate of identical synchronized units depends only on their intrinsic transition rate parameter and not on coupling strength .",
    "the form  ( [ gnu ] ) reduces simply to the constant @xmath10 when the coupled units are perfectly synchronized . while the critical coupling in this new version is higher than in our earlier model and",
    "hence is numerically less efficient , no other features of the synchronization transition are affected .",
    "this in fact supports the desired insensitivity of the interesting macroscopic features of the model to microscopic modifications .    for a population of @xmath40 identical units in the mean field (",

    "for example , in the @xmath9 case we have compared in some detail the cases where the four transition rates are equidistant and where they are pairwise much closer than the separation between the highest and lowest . in both cases there is a single transition to synchrony , albeit not at exactly the same value of @xmath37 , indicating a more complex dependence on the transition rate parameter distribution than just via its mean and width .",
    "furthermore , the basic trends of the dichotomous case broadly carry over , mainly in that the critical value @xmath37 increases when the width of the distribution increases relative to the mean ( as one would expect ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of more transition rates within a given range leads to a lowering of the critical coupling .",
    "thus , for example , the mean transition rate @xmath165 and the width @xmath152 are the same in the cases shown in figs .",
    "[ plot12n ] and [ plot13n ] ( @xmath181 ) , and yet @xmath37 is higher in the former ( 3.95 for @xmath1 ) than in the latter ( 3.6 for @xmath8 ) .",
    "still , the mean and width of the distribution provide a rough qualitative assesment of the behavior , particularly for the case of a uniform distribution , which we study below .",
    "case : the four pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues are plotted in the complex plane for @xmath56 .",
    "the transition rate parameters are chosen to be @xmath182 . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath13 is @xmath183.,width=7 ]",
    "we now turn to globally coupled arrays where the transition rate parameter @xmath10 for each unit is chosen from a uniform distribution over a finite interval , @xmath184 . while it is difficult to make direct analytical progress in this general case , the earlier dimer analysis and the arrays of @xmath185 different populations of units provide a framework for understanding the properties of these more general systems . in particular , the earlier results suggest that this  more disordered \" system may also display a single transition to synchronization . to explore these and other features in more detail ,",
    "we simulate @xmath173 globally connected units characterized by the transition rate parameter distribution @xmath184 , and we make several observations .",
    "firstly , we do observe a single transition to macroscopic synchronization .",
    "secondly , as suggested by the dichotomous case , synchronization appears more readily ( that is , for a lower value of @xmath13 ) if the distribution @xmath186 has a larger mean and smaller width . when the mean and width are varied independently , the qualitative trends from the dichotomous case are observed here as well .",
    "thirdly , while synchronization in this system is again governed primarily by the mean and width of the distribution @xmath184 , the critical value @xmath37 is considerably lower than that of the finite @xmath0 systems with the same mean and width ( as expected ) .     on the interval @xmath187 $ ] and coupling parameter @xmath188 .",
    "insets show the order parameter @xmath133 as well as time resolved snapshots of the system .",
    ", width=7 ]     distribution increases , a critical width is reached beyond which synchronization is destroyed .",
    "the coupling is chosen to be @xmath154 , and the four curves represent the steady state , time - averaged order parameter for distributions with different means . as the mean of the @xmath186 distribution increases ,",
    "the transition to disorder occurs at a greater width .",
    "the insets at the right show the long - time behavior of an entire population of mean transition rate parameter 3.5 ( corresponding to the triangle order parameter data ) and widths of @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191.,width=7 ]     against the relative width @xmath23.,width=7 ]    two examples of our simulation results are shown in figs .",
    "[ sim1 ] and  [ sim2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ sim1 ] we present the first two components of the 3-dimensional vector @xmath95 whose components @xmath15 represent the probability that all units of the entire synchronized array are in state @xmath26 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath48 and @xmath49 oscillate in time with essentially constant amplitude and a constant relative phase , indicating global synchronization .",
    "the upper left inset shows the order parameter @xmath133 and the upper right inset the time resolved snapshot of the system , both indicating a high degree of synchronization .",
    "note that the coupling parameter @xmath188 in the figure is below the critical value @xmath192 for the dichotomous case with the same mean and width .",
    "figure  [ sim2 ] shows the steady state time - averaged order parameter @xmath193 at constant @xmath13 as the width of the @xmath186 distribution is increased for a fixed mean .",
    "similar to the @xmath1 population case , synchronzation is destroyed as the width eclipses some critical value , and that value increases as the mean of the distrubtion increases . in fig .",
    "[ sim3 ] we plot the data from fig  [ sim2 ] as a function of the relative width parameter @xmath23 .",
    "recalling that for the dichotomous array as well as for the dimer synchronzation at a given @xmath13 depends only on @xmath23 , we might expect that the transition point @xmath194 ( at constant @xmath13 ) is not significantly mean - dependent , even when there is a distribution of transition rate parameters .",
    "in fact , we can see that the curves approximately collapse onto one curve , indicating that the relative width @xmath23 provides a useful control parameter for predicting synchronization .",
    "hence , the predictions of the linearization analysis for the @xmath1 case provides qualitatively insight into the behavior of the disordered population .",
    "we have presented a discrete model for globally coupled stochastic nonlinear oscillators with a distribution of transition rate parameters .",
    "our model exhibits a range of interesting dynamical behavior , much of which mimics the qualitative features of the canonical kuramoto oscillator  @xcite , but with a mathematically and numerically considerably more tractable model .",
    "since our phase variable is discrete ( whereas the phase variable in the canonical problem is continuous ) , a distribution of @xmath0 different transition rates in our array leads to a set of @xmath103 coupled nonlinear _ ordinary _",
    "differential equations instead of a single _ partial _ differential equation for the probability distributions of interest .",
    "linearization of our model around the critical point leads to a problem which at least for small @xmath0 ( specifically , for the dichotomous disorder case ) becomes analytically tractable .",
    "distributions involving a large finite number of transition rate parameters , while not easily amenable to analytic manipulation even upon linearization , reduce to a simple matrix algebra problem . for any distribution of transition rate parameters ,",
    "even continuous , the model is in any case readily amenable to numerical simulation .",
    "our most salient conclusion is that such disordered globally coupled arrays of oscillators , even in the face of transition rate parameter disorder , undergo a single transition to macroscopic synchronization .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the critical coupling @xmath37 for synchronization depends strongly ( but not exclusively ) on the width @xmath152 and mean @xmath165 of the transition rate parameter distribution , specifically via the relative width @xmath195 .",
    "this general feature is already apparent in the synchronization behavior of a dimer of two oscillators with transition rate parameters @xmath12 and @xmath79 .",
    "an infinite array of two populations of oscillators , one with transition rate parameter @xmath12 and the other with @xmath79 , displays a hopf bifurcation , with @xmath37 determined solely by @xmath23 .",
    "while a quantitative prediction of synchronization on the basis of the relative width is not possible in all cases , it does determine qualitative aspects of the transition for more complex transition rate parameter distributions .",
    "we have explored this assertion for arrays with @xmath196 and @xmath3 and with a uniform distribution of transition rates over a finite interval , and expect it be appropriate for other smooth distributions as well .",
    "a number of further avenues of investigation based on our stochastic three - state phase - coupled oscillator model are possible .",
    "for example , we could explore the effects of transition rate disorder in locally coupled arrays whose behavior we have fully characterized for identical oscillators  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the consequences of disorder in the coupling parameter @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we note that a two - state version of this model ( which of course does not lead to phase synchronization as discussed here ) has recently been shown to accurately capture the unique statistics of blinking quantum dots  @xcite",
    ". such wider applicability of the model , together with its analytic and numerical tractability , clearly opens the door to a number of new directions of investigation .",
