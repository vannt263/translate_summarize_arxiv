    "we are engaged in the physical problems that can be mathematically modelized by _ the laplacian transfer problem _ @xcite .",
    "these are : the diffusion through semi - permeable membranes and the electrode problem @xcite , the heterogeneous catalysis @xcite , the nmr in porous environment @xcite , etc .",
    "consider the diffusion of particles from the source ( usually supposed planar ) to the semi - permeable membrane with rather complex geometry , see fig .",
    "[ fig : problem]a . in the steady - state regime ,",
    "the concentration of particles @xmath0 obeys the laplacian equation , @xmath1 the flux of particles in the bulk obeys fick s law , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the flux across the surface is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the permeability of the membrane ( the probability per unit time , surface , and concentration for a particle to cross the membrane ) .",
    "equating these two fluxes , we obtain the mixed boundary condition , @xmath6 often called also fourier or robin boundary condition",
    ". the physical parameter @xmath7 plays an important role in this treatment .    in the electrode problem ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : problem]b ) , there are a planar and an irregular electrodes ( with an interface resistivity @xmath8 ) , placed in an electrolyte with a resistivity @xmath9 . the electric potential @xmath10 obeys the laplace equation @xmath11 in the bulk of the electrolyte .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ eq : boundary ] ) is obtained by equating the current from the electrolyte , @xmath12 , to the current @xmath13 crossing the electrode surface , with @xmath14 .    for the heterogeneous catalysis , a catalyst of a complex geometry ( with the reactivity @xmath15 ) is placed in a solution .",
    "when a molecule @xmath16 diffusing in the solution , reaches the catalytic surface , it transforms into @xmath17 with reaction rate @xmath15 . as above , the concentration of molecules @xmath16 obeys the laplace equation ( [ eq : laplace ] ) . the boundary condition ( [ eq : boundary ] ) with @xmath18",
    "is obtained due to the mass conservation .",
    "the same arguments allow to describe the nmr in the porous environment by the laplace equation under the mixed boundary condition .",
    "so , all these different phenomena are described by the same mathematical formalism ( see @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "the laplacian transfer problem is significantly more complex than the corresponding dirichlet or neumann problem . in order to find the solution , filoche and",
    "sapoval @xcite proposed the following program :     to choose the appropriate discretization ;     to solve the discrete problem ;     to take the continuous limit .",
    "for these purposes , they introduced _ the brownian self - transport operator _ @xmath19 .",
    "this operator controls the properties of the laplacian transfer and depends only on the geometry of membrane s boundary .",
    "it can be easily defined for a given discrete membrane : @xmath20 is the probability of first contact with the membrane on the @xmath21-th site if started from the @xmath22-th site ( without touching other sites ! ) .",
    "this is exactly the problem of the hitting probabilities on the lattice .",
    "so , if one can calculate @xmath19 for any `` reasonable '' membrane , the laplacian transfer problem would be solved ( except the difficulties related with the continuous limit ) . in this paper",
    ", we construct the brownian self - transport operator for the membranes with a rather general geometry .",
    "now we should specify what the term `` reasonable membrane '' means . for the moment , we confine ourselves to the two - dimensional case ( square lattice ) in order to clarify the representation of our treatment .",
    "when two - dimensional results are obtained , we shall explain how they can be generalized for the multi - dimensional case . on a square lattice ,",
    "the laplacian equation ( [ eq : laplace ] ) becomes @xmath23 i.e. , diffusion can be modelized by _",
    "simple _ random walks .",
    "we suppose that the membranes are quite regular .",
    "it means that one can choose such discretization that the number of singular points is negligible by comparison with the number of regular points ( contrariwise to the case of fractal membranes ) . as we decided to work on the square lattice",
    ", we should represent the membrane as a sequence of horizontal and vertical segments .",
    "the last difficulty concerns with corners .",
    "the problem is that a corner point is connected with _",
    "two _ lattice points whereas a regular point is connected with only one lattice point .",
    "we would like to be indemnified from these ambiguities .",
    "to avoid the corner points , we use the following rules :     for the internal corner ( see fig .  [ fig : corner]a ,  [ fig : corner]b ) , we carry the corner point from the boundary to the bulk of membrane .     for the external corner ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : corner]c ,  [ fig : corner]d ) , we completely remove the corner point from the lattice .",
    "the links from the boundary to these points are also removed .",
    "two other links are closed to each other .",
    "this operation preserves the connectivity of the lattice and eliminates the singularities ( corner points ) .",
    "section  [ sec : definitions ] introduces definitions and restrictions which allow us to reach final results .",
    "section  [ sec : technique ] is devoted to the technique developped in our previous paper @xcite for _ one - dimensional regular surfaces with compact support_. note that the actual treatment is partially based on the previous results .",
    "the distribution of hitting probabilities for a two - dimensional finite membrane is obtained in section  [ sec:2d ] .",
    "the generalization of these results for multi - dimensional case is described in section  [ sec : multi ] . in section",
    "[ sec : bso ] , we explicitly construct the brownian self - transport operator .",
    "some important generalizations are given in section  [ sec : generalizations ] .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical ] describes some numerical results in order to verify the method . in the last section we make conclusions .",
    "consider a square lattice @xmath24 on a plane . a _",

    "the sequence of points @xmath29 is called _ membrane s boundary _ if it obeys the following conditions :    \\1 .",
    "_ bijection _ : index @xmath30 enumerates the points @xmath31 , i.e. , there is one - to - one correspondance ( bijection ) between the set of integer numbers @xmath32 and the set of boundary points @xmath33 .",

    "_ compactness _ : there is only _ finite _ number @xmath42 of boundary points ( in @xmath34 ) which do not lie on the horizontal axis , i.e. , the non - plane part of the membrane has a finite size .",

    ", we introduce the following conventions :     the bulk of membrane is placed in the lower half plane ( except , possibly , a finite number of points ) ;     non - plane boundary points are enumerated by index @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49\\hskip 4 mm   y_m\\ne 0 , \\hskip 8 mm   \\forall \\ : m\\notin [ 1 .. m ]   \\hskip 4 mm y_m=0   .\\ ] ]    let us discuss the definition of the finite membrane .",
    "the boundary and accessibility conditions provide that boundary points take their places sufficiently close to each other , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "the accessibility condition prohibits the existence of corner points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : accessibility]a ,  [ fig : accessibility]b ) .",
    "moreover , this condition forbids also the `` diagonal '' points ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : accessibility]c ) .",
    "this means that membrane s boundary is composed of horizontal and vertical segments just as required .",
    "so , we can conclude that these two conditions provide all the necessary properties which were described in the introduction .    a ,  [ fig : accessibility]b ) and `` diagonal '' points ( fig .",
    "[ fig : accessibility]c).,width=408,height=113 ]    the compactness condition is essential to achieve our goal .",
    "this condition means that the membrane is composed by three parts : two plane `` tails '' on the same height , and one intermediate ( non - trivial ) part that can be very complex but finite .",
    "the importance of the compactness condition was throughly discussed in the previous paper , and we do not repeat it here . note that in practice , this condition is not too restrictive because usually one considers the finite number of sites .    according to the bijection condition",
    ", we can define the function @xmath51 which gives the index of the boundary points @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 . note that this function is defined only on the boundary points : if @xmath54 , @xmath51 has no value .",
    "we shall use the following convention :    if @xmath54 , the object containing @xmath51 is equal to @xmath55 .",
    "for example , if we write @xmath56 , we always mean @xmath57 , where @xmath58 note that it is just a useful convention to simplify the expressions .",
    "we call all the points @xmath59 the _",
    "@xmath60 level_. we say that the membrane s boundary lies between @xmath61 and @xmath62 levels if @xmath63    the external point @xmath16 is called _ near - boundary point _ , if there exists @xmath30  such that @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath16 lies `` near '' the membrane s bourdary .",
    "the functions defined on these points , are called _ near - boundary functions _ ( see below ) .",
    "we enumerate these points ( and functions ) by the same index @xmath30 as for boundary points .",
    "note that usually we suppose @xmath65 $ ] , i.e. , we take into account near - boundary points which lie near the non - plane part of the membrane .",
    "the external points @xmath66 are called _",
    "ground points_. the functions defined on these points , are called _",

    "note that there exist membranes without ground points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2d]a for example ) .",
    "we introduce the _ outer normal _",
    "@xmath69 for each site of the membrane s boundary . due to the accessibility condition",
    ", we have no corner points , therefore this vector is correctly defined .",
    "note that @xmath30-th near - boundary point is just @xmath70 , i.e. , the outer normal is a vector directed from the boundary point to the corresponding near - boundary point .",
    "let @xmath71 be the hitting probability , i.e. , the probability of the first contact with the membrane on point @xmath72 if started from an external point @xmath73 without touching other boundary points .",
    "their characteristic functions @xmath74 are @xmath75 the inverse fourier transform allows to obtain @xmath76 , @xmath77",
    "here we briefly present the technique which was developped in @xcite to obtain the distribution of hitting probabilities for a regular surface with compact support .",
    "all the details can be found in this paper .",
    "the discrete laplacian equation ( [ eq : laplace_discrete ] ) in terms of characteristic functions is simply @xmath78 .\\ ] ] using the convolution properties of hitting probabilities and their normalization , one obtains the distribution of hitting probabilities for a planar surface , @xmath79 where function @xmath80 is @xmath81 we wrote @xmath82 given that for the lower half plane ( @xmath83 ) one has exactly the same result due to reflection symmetry .    for the non - planar membrane , relations ( [ eq : relation ] )",
    "remain valid for _ external points _ , but there are also _ membrane s points _ where it is not true .",
    "nevertheless , we preserve this form by adding the correction term which equals to @xmath55 on external points .    in order to simplify manipulation with characteristic functions , we introduce vectors @xmath84 containing all @xmath74 on the @xmath85-th level with @xmath86 ( at the end of calculations @xmath87 )",
    ". we can write ( [ eq : relation ] ) as @xmath88 where @xmath16 is tridiagonal matrix with elements : @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( we also introduce an insignificant modification @xmath91 to have the cyclic structure of @xmath16 ) , @xmath92 is the correction for membrane s points .",
    "matrix @xmath16 has eigenvalues @xmath93 and eigenvectors @xmath94 whose @xmath95-th component is simply @xmath96 .",
    "we decompose @xmath84 and @xmath97 on the base of @xmath94 , @xmath98 their coefficients @xmath99 and @xmath100 obey the recurrence relations @xmath101 so , the problem now is to find @xmath102 .",
    "it can be solved in two steps .",
    "first , using ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) with certain conditions , we can express @xmath99 in terms of @xmath100 , @xmath103 and @xmath80 .",

    "note that using only two simple identities , @xmath118 one can verify directly , without intermediate steps of @xcite , that ( [ eq : c_y ] ) is the solution of recurrence relations ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) .",
    "now we write @xmath74 as @xmath119 .\\ ] ]    so , the first step of our program is completed .",
    "note that all the above results are exactly the same as for a regular surface with compact support ( by this reason we did not explain all details of calculation ) .",
    "now we are ready to pass to the second step : to find @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "these coefficients significantly depend on the membrane s geometry .",
    "thus we can not use the expressions of @xcite , and we should recalculate @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "to calculate @xmath122 we should define explicitly what @xmath123 is .",
    "we recall that these vectors were introduced in order to write correctly the expression ( [ eq : relation ] ) for the membrane s points . in other words , relations (",
    "[ eq : relation ] ) are satisfied automatically for any external point , but they should be imposed artificially for any point of the membrane .    for membrane s point we have @xmath124 because particles can not penetrate in the depth of the membrane .",
    "the first line of ( [ eq : zeros ] ) represents the condition @xmath125 .",
    "indeed , if a particle starts from the boundary point @xmath31 , it should be immediately absorbed by this point .",
    "in other words , the probability to be absorbed by the @xmath30-th site is equal to @xmath126 while the other sites have no chance . expression ( [ eq : zeros ] ) means that in @xmath123 there is only the contribution of boundary points and of membrane s points near boundary .",

    "again we insist to use our convention about @xmath129 , i.e. , in expression ( [ eq : correction ] ) there are only the terms where corresponding point lies on @xmath34 .    using ( [ eq : correction ] ) , we determine @xmath122 according to its definition , @xmath131    usually there are a few nonzero components of @xmath123 for each @xmath132 .",
    "indeed , according to the formula ( [ eq : correction ] ) , @xmath133 is defined by the boundary points and by the membrane s points near the boundary .",
    "but on the @xmath21-th level there are a few such points , if @xmath134 . on the contrary ,",
    "on the level zero there is an infinity of the boundary points due to the plane `` tails '' .",
    "thus , the vector @xmath135 has exceptional structure .",
    "it contains the usual terms due to the non - trivial part of the membrane , and the contribution of plane `` tails '' .",
    "let us calculate the contribution of the @xmath30-th boundary point to @xmath74 ( see the second term in ( [ eq : phi_xy ] ) ) . during these calculations we consider the case @xmath136 , i.e. , we write just @xmath115 omitting @xmath137 .",
    "the opposite case @xmath83 is obtained by reflection of all ordinates with respect to the horizontal axis , @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "with the outer normal @xmath140 is arounded by two boundary points on the same level ( @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) , and by one external point @xmath143 and one internal points @xmath144.,width=283,height=188 ]    following the direction of the outer normal , there are four possible positions of the boundary point .",
    "let us consider the case when @xmath140 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] ) .",
    "we suppose that the boundary point does not lie near the corners ( i.e. , we consider _ general position _ of the boundary point ) .",
    "the points near corners will be considered separately in appendices  [ sec : corner ] .",
    "note that these points give the additional corrections due to the lattice distortion caused by the procedure of corner s removing . usually their influence is negligible , and we do not account them here ( see appendices for more details ) .    the boundary point @xmath145 has four neighbours : one external point @xmath143 , one internal point @xmath144 , and two boundary points @xmath141 and @xmath142 with indices @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "let us write accurately the corrections for all these points . using ( [ eq : correction ] )",
    ", we obtain    [ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     _ table 1 .",
    "monte - carlo verifications of the method s work . for @xmath148 ,",
    "the maximal deviation @xmath149 is calculated .",
    "_    these results confirm that formulae ( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : p_d ] ) work correctly .",
    "in this paper , we defined a wide class of finite membranes which play an important role for the discrete laplacian transfer problem .",
    "we based on the technique of characteristic functions developped in our previous paper .",
    "in particular , expressions ( [ eq : conditions ] ) are used to close the recurrence relations ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) .",
    "we remind that expression @xmath150 was the central approximation of @xcite . in order to obtain this approximate relation",
    ", we supposed that from a remote line @xmath151 ( for large @xmath104 ) the membrane can be viewed as almost translationally invariant object ( along the horizontal axis ) .",
    "then the explicit solution of recurrence relations ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) had been found .",
    "finally , we took the limit @xmath109 ( and @xmath110 for the lower half plane ) to obtain expression ( [ eq : c_y ] ) for coefficients @xmath102 .",
    "it means that influence of approximate relation ( [ eq : conditions ] ) vanishes . in other words , the approximate relation ( [ eq : conditions ] ) is taken at infinity ( @xmath109 ) , i.e. , this condition has no influence on the solution .",
    "moreover , one can verify directly , without any approximation , that ( [ eq : c_y ] ) is the exact solution of recurrence relations ( [ eq : recurrence ] ) .",
    "we stress that the essential result of our calculations is the form of solution ( [ eq : p ] ) which expresses the distribution of hitting probabilities for a general membrane , @xmath71 , in terms of corresponding planar distribution , @xmath152 . in other words",
    ", we explicitate how the membrane s geometry should change the planar distribution .",
    "it means that having solved the planar problem , one can easily generalize its solution for the case with a rather complex geometry .",
    "for example , when the problem with horizontal barrier for the planar case was solved , we just replaced old coefficients @xmath152 by the new ones .",
    "the same ideas were used for the time - dependent distribution and for the multi - dimensional generalization . note that these motivations are frequently used in the theory of conformal transforms . indeed , taking an appropriate conformal transform",
    ", one can map the initial complex set into a simple set ( like a half plane or a disk ) , solve the simplified problem , and then reconstruct the solution by the inverse conformal transform .",
    "note also that the conformal theory works only in two - dimensional case while the present approach is valid for any dimension of the lattice .",
    "let us briefly discuss the role of ground functions . from the beginning , the upper and the lower half planes were considered separately ( for example , see two terms @xmath115 and @xmath137 in equation ( [ eq : c_y ] ) ) .",
    "the technique proposed in @xcite consists to _ step down _ from the @xmath104-th and @xmath153-th levels to the level zero .",
    "it allows to express coefficients @xmath99 in terms of @xmath100 .",
    "but we can not step down directly from @xmath104-th to @xmath153-th level , because there appears an infinity of near - boundary functions due to @xmath154 , and we do not achieve our goal .",
    "in other words , we can not `` pass '' through the level zero in our treatment .",
    "on the other hand , a random walk started at the upper half plane may hit the boundary point in the lower half plane ( if such point exists ) .",
    "this walk passes the level zero through an external point , i.e. , through a ground point .",
    "therefore we can say that ground functions `` connect '' the solutions for the upper and lower half planes .",
    "consider as example the concave membrane ( fig .  [ fig:2d]b ) .",
    "the probability to hit the @xmath21-th site in the lower half plane if started from a point @xmath52 in the upper half plane becomes @xmath155 we simply took ( [ eq : p ] ) under condition that @xmath136 , @xmath156 for @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "this formula has a clear probabilistic sense : to hit the @xmath21-th site , the walk should reach one of the ground points ( enumerated by @xmath157 ) with probability because in the upper half plane there is no `` perturbation '' , the concave membrane completely lies in the lower half plane . ]",
    "@xmath158 , and after that hit the @xmath21-th site with probability @xmath159 .",
    "now we clarify the nature of coefficients @xmath160 which seem to be artificial at the first sight .",
    "first of all , they _ have no _ purely probabilistic sense ( for example , they can have values greater than @xmath126 ) . to understand the sense of these coefficients ,",
    "consider the simple problem : to find the probability to hit a point @xmath161 if started from @xmath52 without touching the horizontal axis .",
    "the solution of this problem is given in appendices 9.2 , @xmath162}=\\frac{d^{y , y_0}_{x - x_0}}{d^{y_0,y_0}_0 } .\\ ] ] using this solution , we can rewrite ( [ eq : p ] ) for @xmath37 as @xmath163 } d^{y_n+\\delta y_n , y_n+\\delta y_n}_0\\ ] ] @xmath164}d^{y_m , y_m}_0p_{[m]}(n)+ \\sum\\limits _ { g=1}^g h^y_{x-\\bar{x}_g}p_{\\bar{x}_g,0}(n ) .\\ ] ] now this expression has more clear sense : we take all possible ways to reach near - boundary point @xmath165 without touching the horizontal axis , and then subtract all ways which go through membrane s points .",
    "coefficients @xmath166 and @xmath167 have combinatoric origin : they allow to account different possibilities to go through the membrane . according to definition ( [ eq : d ] ) , @xmath168 and for two - dimensional case",
    "the approximation @xmath169 gives @xmath170 with a sufficiently high accuracy .",
    "writing ( [ eq : psimple ] ) for the planar membrane , one has @xmath171}d^{1,1}_0 , \\ ] ] i.e. , a particle reaches near - boundary point @xmath172 with probability @xmath173}$ ] , and then it hits corresponding boundary point @xmath174 with probability @xmath175 just as required .",
    "coefficients @xmath176 can be viewed from another standpoint .",
    "a direct verification shows that @xmath177 where the discrete laplacian @xmath178 operates on coordinates @xmath52 or @xmath179 ( we remind that @xmath180 ) .",
    "for example , in two - dimensional case we have @xmath181 it means that coefficients @xmath176 can be treated as _",
    "green s functions _ of the discrete dirichlet problem in the upper half plane .",
    "consequently , the solution of the general dirichlet problem in the same ( planar ) geometry , @xmath182 is given as @xmath183 unfortunately , this result has no direct connection with our actual problem of general membranes .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the following trick .",
    "what violates the using of green s function @xmath176 ?",
    "the answer is that there exist the boundary and internal points of the membrane with @xmath136 .",
    "obviously , the laplacian equation becomes invalid on these points .",
    "however , we can correct this situation by introducing a certain function @xmath184 ( here @xmath21 is a parameter ) . in other words , we impose the laplacian equation artificially for the boundary and internal points .",
    "the correction function is equal to @xmath55 for any external point .",
    "moreover , @xmath185 equals to @xmath55 for almost all internal point except the internal layer whose points are nearest to the membrane s boundary . for the boundary points we have @xmath186 whereas for the nearest internal layer @xmath187 now we can write the general solution in terms of green s functions , @xmath188 .\\ ] ] imposing the boundary condition @xmath125 and considering step by step four possible directions of the outer normal , one can demonstrate that this formula can be written as @xmath189}(n ) .\\ ] ] note that here we do not discuss neither contribution of plane `` tails '' , nor ground functions .",
    "one can easily complete these motivations in order to obtain formula ( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "this approach is also valid for multi - dimensional case .",
    "the important application of the distribution ( [ eq : p ] ) of hitting probabilities is the explicit construction of the brownian self - transport operator @xmath19 which governes the laplacian transfer .",
    "we obtained the explicit formula ( [ eq : q ] ) for @xmath19 , and it opens the possibility of analytical researches in this field .",
    "note that exact analytical expression of @xmath19 even for a planar membrane allowed to obtain the important characteristics of the laplacian transfer , @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , expression ( [ eq : q ] ) simplifies also the numerical treatment of the problem .",
    "usually one uses computer simulations of random walks to calculate the matrix elements of @xmath19 . in order to obtain the whole matrix @xmath19 with a high accuracy",
    ", one should make enormous number of random walks .",
    "moreover , one walk can be very long , especially on lattices with @xmath190 . on the contrary , working with our approach ,",
    "one just needs to manipulate in the framework of linear algebra .",
    "once calculated , coefficients @xmath191 can be easily used for any membrane .",
    "therefore , one just needs to `` compose '' the matrix @xmath3 for a given membrane , and to inverse @xmath192 .",
    "the time required to make these operations depends only on the number of sites for which one calculates @xmath19 .    in order to adjust the formalism to a more realistic membrane ,",
    "one can introduce different barriers .",
    "as we described above , the horizontal barrier can be introduced by simple modification of coefficients @xmath152 while the problem with vectical barriers is more complicated .",
    "we conclude that the present treatment opens a wide field for further investigations .",
    "the author would like to thank professor b.sapoval and professor m.filoche whose invaluable advice helped to develop the present approach and to construct the brownian self - transport operator .",
    "in section  [ sec : boundary ] , we calculated the contributions of the boundary points supposing that these points are in general position . in other words , we did not consider the neighbourhood of the corners .",
    "moreover , the procedure of corner points removing distorts the lattice near corners ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : corner]d ) , and we did not account the influence of such distortion . for sufficiently regular membranes , these corrections should not change the distribution of hitting probabilities globally .",
    "however , the lattice distortions can perturb significantly the solution locally , in the vicinity of the corners",
    ". it can be important for certain problems .",
    "here we briefly explain how solution ( [ eq : p ] ) can be improved in order to account such local distortions .",
    "note that these corrections carry a particular character , they depend on the way how the lattice has been distorted . for example , if one would not like to remove the corners , there is no correction .",
    "we wrote the laplacian equation ( [ eq : relation ] ) for any external point , in particular , @xmath194 after that , we removed the corner point @xmath193 ( thus one can take @xmath195 ) , and connected points @xmath196 and @xmath197 to each other by a liaison .",
    "it means that the true laplacian equation is @xmath198 we prefer to work with the previous _ general _ form , and for these purposes we introduce here the correction term @xmath199 which is equal to @xmath200 .",
    "the same concerns the point @xmath197 .",
    "so , each external corner gives two correction terms ( in two - dimensional case ) .",
    "note that these corrections have not been accounted above , they appear due to distortion of the lattice .",
    "we should also consider the laplacian equation at point @xmath193 because this _ removed _ point has been accounted in the general treatment , @xmath201 above we supposed that the left hand side is equal to @xmath55 because the point @xmath193 was referred as external point .",
    "now we calculate the corrections due to the lattice distortions , and for these purposes we write the correction term @xmath202 . taking all these terms , we obtain the whole contribution of the corner point @xmath193 , @xmath203 \\phi _ { x_c-1,y_c}-\\bigl[e^{-ix_c\\theta _ h}\\gamma ^{(y)}_{y_c}-e^{-i(x_c-1)\\theta _ h } \\gamma ^{(y)}_{y_c}\\bigr]\\phi _ { x_c , y_c+1}\\ ] ] @xmath204 two last terms",
    "should be included into the contribution of boundary points with indices @xmath205 and @xmath206 respectively ( exactly these two terms are missed if one considers the boundary points near corners , see section  [ sec : boundary ] ) .",
    "two first terms involve the unknown characteristic functions @xmath200 and @xmath207 that can be called _",
    "corner functions_. it means that in general case formula ( [ eq : p ] ) becomes @xmath208 @xmath209 , \\ ] ] where @xmath210 denotes the right hand side of ( [ eq : p ] ) , and @xmath211 are two outer normals on the corner point @xmath193 .",
    "the corner functions @xmath212 can be calculated by the same way that was used for near - boundary functions , i.e. , we close the system of linear equations and solve it .",
    "the last formula gives a right distribution for all sites of the membrane , including the points near corners .",
    "consider the simple problem of finding the distribution of hitting probabilities @xmath71 on the horizontal axis if there exists an absorbing point @xmath213 with @xmath214 .",
    "as consequence , we shall find the probability to hit the point @xmath213 if started from @xmath52 without touching the horizontal axis .          on the contrary , we can use formula ( [ eq : c_y ] ) .",
    "there exists the only correction @xmath215 for the unique point @xmath213 , i.e. , @xmath216 ( we omitted @xmath217 because it equals to @xmath55 ) . using formula ( [ eq : phi_xy ] ) and taking the limit @xmath87",
    ", we obtain @xmath218 where @xmath219 applying the inverse fourier transform , we obtain @xmath220 looking on this relation , we say that there are four _ near - boundary _ functions on four points around @xmath213 .",
    "taking corresponding @xmath221 and @xmath85 and summarizing four equations for near - boundary functions , we write the equation for their sum , @xmath222}(n)=\\bigl(h^{y_0}_{1-n}+h^{y_0}_{-1-n}+h^{y_0 + 1}_{-n } + h^{y_0 - 1}_{-n}\\bigr)\\ ] ] @xmath223}(n ) .\\ ] ] using the properties of coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath160 , we can simplify this relation and express the sum of near - boundary functions , @xmath224}(n)=\\frac{h^{y_0}_{-n}}{d^{y_0,y_0}_0 } .\\ ] ] substituting this sum into ( [ eq : pone ] ) , we have @xmath225 so , the problem is solved . the probability to hit the point @xmath213 without touching the horizontal axis"
