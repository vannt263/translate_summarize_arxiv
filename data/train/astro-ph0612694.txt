    "the ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrino detection is one the most important step forward in the cosmic ray ( cr ) physics .",
    "the discovery of neutrinos with energy larger than @xmath0 ev will start the neutrino astronomy , enabling the observation of the most distant and powerful sources in the universe .",
    "the existence of neutrinos with such high energy is intimately related to the observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "soon after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation it was shown that the flux of uhecr , with an energy larger than @xmath1 ev , should be characterized by a sharp steepening at energies @xmath2  ev , due to the absorption processes on the cmb radiation .",
    "this effect is the well known graisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off @xcite .",
    "after a few decades of observations the detection of the gzk steepening is still one of the major open problems in uhecr physics and the experimental data are not conclusive .",
    "the 11 akeno grand air shower array ( agasa ) events with energy larger than @xmath3 ev @xcite contradict the expected suppression of the uhecr spectrum . on the other hand",
    "the hires data seem to be consistent with the gzk cut - off picture @xcite .",
    "if the uhecr primaries are protons and if they propagate rectilinearly , as the claimed correlation with bl - lacs at energy @xmath4 ev implies @xcite , than their sources must be seen in the direction of the highest energies events with energies up to @xmath5 ev detected by hires , fly s eye and agasa @xcite . at these energies",
    "the proton attenuation length is only about @xmath6 mpc and no counterparts in any frequency band was observed in the direction of these uhecr events .",
    "this is a strong indication that cr particles with energies larger than @xmath3 ev may have a different origin from those with lower energies .",
    "models of origin of uhecr fall into two categories , top - down and bottom - up",
    ". in the bottom - up scenario uhecr originates from cosmic accelerators . in these accelerators particles of relatively low energy",
    "are brought to uhe through multiple interactions at the source .",
    "the most promising accelerators known in nature are based on the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism , in which the particle acceleration is realized through multiple interactions with a shock front .",
    "this mechanism works fairly well in super nova remnants ( snr ) that are believed to be the responsible for the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays of energy @xmath7 ev ( for a review see @xcite ) . at the highest energies different bottom - up scenario",
    "have been proposed , among them , the most promising , are those in which acceleration is realized through the interaction with a relativistic shock front in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) . in the framework of bottom - up models the observed uhecr flux should show the predicted gzk steepening and uhe neutrinos are produced by the interaction of uhecr with different backgrounds , at the source and during their journey to us .",
    "these are the so - called cosmogenic neutrinos ( first proposed in @xcite ) that we will not discuss here .",
    "the presence of an excess of events as claimed by agasa inspired the introduction of several exotic models for the production of uhecr .",
    "these models , collectively called top - down , explain the excess of agasa and give also a clear explanation for the lacking of any counterpart of the highest energy events .",
    "many different ideas have been proposed among top - down models : strongly interacting neutrinos @xcite and new light hadrons @xcite as unabsorbed signal carriers , @xmath8-bursts @xcite , lorentz - invariance violation @xcite , topological defects ( td ) ( see @xcite for a review ) , and superheavy dark matter ( shdm ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in the present paper",
    "we will concentrate our attention on the two last models that show common features : uhe particles are produced in the decay of superheavy particles , that we shall call collectively @xmath9 particles , with a typical mass of the order of the grand unified energy scale @xmath10 ev . in the case of td the @xmath9 particle once produced , by the internal dynamics of the defect or through the interaction of different defects , immediately decays . while in the case of shdm the @xmath9 particle itself is long - lived contributing to the dark matter of the universe .    from the point of view of elementary particle physics the @xmath9 particle decay process",
    "proceed in a way similar to @xmath11 annihilation into hadrons : two or more off - mass - shell quarks and gluons are produced and they initiate a qcd cascade .",
    "finally the partons are hadronized at the confinement radius .",
    "most of the hadrons in the final state are pions and thus the typical prediction of all these models is the dominance of neutrinos and photons at the highest energies @xmath12  ev .",
    "it is important to stress here that these models predict neutrino fluxes most likely within reach of the first generation neutrino telescopes such as amanda , and certainly detectable by future kilometer - scale neutrino observatories @xcite .",
    "the first step to determine the neutrino flux produced in the decay of @xmath9 particles is the determination of the hadron spectrum .",
    "moreover , this evaluation is particularly important because it represents a direct signature of the production mechanism that , in principle , can be detected experimentally .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the mass of the decaying particle , @xmath13 , that represents the total cms energy @xmath14 , is in the range @xmath15 ",
    "@xmath16  gev .",
    "the existing qcd monte carlo ( mc ) codes become numerically unstable at much smaller energies , e.g. , at @xmath17  gev and the computing time increases rapidly going to larger energies . in this section",
    "we will briefly review the main results obtained , in the computation of the top - down spectrum of uhe particles , using two different computational techniques : one based on a new mc scheme @xcite and the other based on the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite . in both cases",
    "susy is included in the computation .",
    "monte carlo simulations are the most physical approach for high energy calculations which allow to incorporate many important physical features as the presence of susy partons in the cascade and coherent branching .",
    "the perturbative part of a qcd monte carlo simulation is quite standard with the inclusion of susy . for the non - perturbative hadronization part",
    "an original phenomenological approach is used in ref .",
    "the fragmentation of a parton @xmath18 into an hadron @xmath19 is expressed through perturbative fragmentation function of partons @xmath20 , that represents the probability of fragmentation of a parton @xmath18 into a parton @xmath21 with momentum fraction @xmath22 , convoluted with the hadronization functions @xmath23 at scale @xmath24 , that is understood as the fragmentation function of the parton @xmath18 into the hadron @xmath19 at the hadronization scale @xmath25 gev @xcite . to obtain the fragmentation functions of hadrons",
    "one has :    @xmath26    where the hadronization functions do not depend on the scale @xmath13 .",
    "this important property of hadronization functions allows the determination of @xmath27 from the available lep data , @xmath28 at the scale @xmath29 .",
    "the fragmentation functions @xmath28 at a high scale @xmath13 can be calculated also evolving them from a low scale , e.g. @xmath29 , where they are known experimentally or with great accuracy using the mc scheme .",
    "this evolution is described by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite which can be written as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the scale , @xmath32 denotes the convolution @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the splitting function which describes the emission of parton @xmath21 by parton @xmath18 .",
    "apart from the experimentally rather well determined quark fragmentation function @xmath35 , also the gluon fragmentation function @xmath36 is needed for the evolution of eq .",
    "( [ dglap - eq ] ) .",
    "the gluon ff can be taken either from mc simulations or from fits to experimental data , in particular to the longitudinal polarized @xmath11 annihilation cross - section and three - jet events .",
    "the first application of the dglap method for the calculation of hadron spectra from decaying superheavy particles has been made in refs .",
    "the most detailed calculations have been performed by barbot and drees @xcite , where more than 30 different particles were allowed to be cascading and the mass spectrum of the susy particles was taken into account .",
    "the results obtained with the two different techniques discussed above agree fairly well @xcite .",
    "the accuracy in the hadron spectrum calculations has reached such a level that one can consider the spectral shape as a signature of the model .",
    "the predicted hadron spectrum is approximately @xmath37 in the region of @xmath38 relevant for uhecr observations .",
    "the spectra of neutrinos and photons produced by the decay of superheavy particles are of practical interest in high energy astrophysics and can be computed from the decay of charged pions @xcite .",
    "the ffs for charged pions and protons+antiprotons can be determined , following @xcite , from the ffs of hadrons @xmath39 simply introducing the ratios @xmath40 and @xmath41 as : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the spectra of pions and nucleons at large @xmath13 have approximately the same shape as the hadron spectra , and one can use in this case @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .    an interesting feature of the up - dated calculations performed in @xcite and by barbot and drees in @xcite is the ratio of photons to nucleons , @xmath46 . at @xmath47",
    "this ratio is characterized by a value of 2  3 only @xcite .",
    "this result has an important impact for shdm and topological defect models because the fraction of nucleons in the primary radiation increases .",
    "however , in both models photons dominate ( i.e. their fraction becomes @xmath48 ) at @xmath49  ev .",
    "let us now concentrate our attention on uhecr from superheavy dark matter ( shdm ) @xcite and topological defects ( td ) @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the uhecr spectrum obtained with the agasa data , will provide us with the correct neutrino flux normalization .",
    "production of shdm particles naturally occurs in a time - varying gravitational field of the expanding universe at the post - inflationary stage .",
    "the relic density of these particles is mainly determined ( at fixed reheating temperature and inflaton mass ) by their mass @xmath13 .",
    "the range of practical interest is @xmath50 gev , at larger masses the shdm is a subdominant component of the dm .",
    "shdm is accumulated in the galactic halo with the overdensity @xmath51 , where @xmath52 gev/@xmath53 , @xmath54 g/@xmath53 and @xmath55 @xcite . with these numbers , @xmath56 .",
    "because of this large local overdensity , uhecrs from shdm have no gzk cutoff .",
    "clumpiness of shdm in the halo can provide the observed small - angle clustering .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 of relic abundance @xmath58 and lifetime @xmath59 of the @xmath9 particle is fixed by the observed uhecr flux as @xmath60 . in the most interesting case of gravitational production of @xmath9 particles ,",
    "their present abundance is determined by their mass @xmath13 and the reheating temperature @xmath61 . choosing a specific particle physics model one can fix also the life - time of the @xmath9 particle . there",
    "exist many models in which sh particles can be quasi - stable with lifetime @xmath62  yr .",
    "the measurement of the uhecr flux , and thereby of @xmath63 , selects from the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath64 a two - dimensional subspace compatible with the shdm hypothesis .    in figure",
    "[ fig ] ( left panel ) we have performed a fit to the agasa data using the photon flux from the shdm model and the proton flux from uniformly distributed astrophysical sources . for the latter we have used the non - evolutionary model of @xcite .",
    "the photon flux is normalized to provide the best fit to the agasa data at @xmath65  ev .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     one can see from the fit of figure [ fig ] ( left panel ) , that the shdm model can explain only the excess of agasa events at @xmath66  ev : depending on the shdm spectrum normalization and the details of the calculations for the extragalactic protons , the flux from shdm decays becomes dominant only above @xmath67  ev .",
    "topological defects ( for a review see @xcite and reference therein ) can naturally produce uhe particles .",
    "the following td have been discussed as potential sources of uhe particles : superconducting strings , ordinary strings , monopolonium ( bound monopole - antimonopole pair ) , monopolonia ( monopole - antimonopole pairs connected by a string ) , networks of monopoles connected by strings , vortons and necklaces ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "monopolonia and vortons are clustering in the galactic halo and their observational signatures for uhecr are identical to shdm . however",
    "the friction of monopolonia in cosmic plasma results in monopolonium lifetime much shorter than the age of the universe . of all other td which are not clustering in the galactic halo , the most favorable for uhecr",
    "necklaces are hybrid td produced in the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath68 . at the first symmetry breaking monopoles",
    "are produced , at the second one each ( anti- ) monopole get attached to two strings .",
    "this system resembles ordinary cosmic strings with monopoles playing the role of beads .",
    "necklaces exist as the long strings and loops . the symmetry breaking scales of the two phase transitions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , are the main parameters of the necklaces .",
    "they determine the monopole mass , @xmath71 , and the mass of the string per unit length @xmath72 .",
    "the evolution of necklaces is governed by the ratio @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the average separation of a monopole and antimonopole along the string . as it is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , necklaces evolve towards configuration with @xmath75 .",
    "monopoles and antimonopoles trapped in the necklaces inevitably annihilate in the end , producing heavy higgs and gauge bosons ( @xmath9 particles ) and then hadrons .",
    "the rate of @xmath9 particles production in the universe can be estimated as @xcite @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the cosmological time .",
    "the photons and electrons from pion decays initiate e - m cascades and the cascade energy density can be calculated as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the redshift and @xmath80 is the fraction of the total energy release transferred to the cascade .",
    "the parameters of the necklace model for uhecr are restricted by the egret observations  @xcite of the diffuse gamma - ray flux .",
    "this flux is produced by uhe electrons and photons from necklaces due to e - m cascades initiated in collisions with cmb photons . in the range of the egret observations , @xmath81  mev , the predicted spectrum is @xmath82 with @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the egret observations determined the spectral index as @xmath84 and the energy density of radiation as @xmath85  ev/@xmath53 .",
    "the cascade limit consists in the bound @xmath86 .",
    "according to the recent calculations , the galactic contribution of gamma rays to the egret observations is larger than estimated earlier , and the extragalactic gamma - ray spectrum is not described by a power - law with @xmath87 . in this case , the limit on the cascade radiation with @xmath83 is more restrictive and is given by @xmath88 ; we shall use this limit in further estimates . using @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91  gyr @xcite we obtain from the limit on the cascade radiation @xmath92  gev@xmath93 .",
    "the important and unique feature of necklaces is their small separation @xmath94 , which ensures an high density .",
    "the distance @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 @xcite ; since @xmath96 is limited by e - m cascade radiation we can obtain a lower limit on the separation between necklaces as @xmath97 , this small distance is a unique property of necklaces allowing the unabsorbed arrival of particles with the highest energies .",
    "the fluxes of uhecr from necklaces are shown in figure [ fig ] ( right panel ) .",
    "we used in the calculations @xmath98",
    "gev@xmath93 which corresponds to @xmath99   ev/@xmath53 , i.e. twice less than allowed by the bound on @xmath89 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath9 particles produced by monopole - antimonopole annihilations is taken as @xmath100  gev . from figure",
    "[ fig ] ( right panel ) one can see that the necklaces model for uhecr can explain only the highest energy part of the spectrum , with the agasa excess somewhat above the prediction .",
    "thus uhe particles from necklaces can serve only as an additional component in the observed uhecr flux .",
    "this result has a particular impact on the possible uhe neutrino detection .",
    "in fact , the necklaces model is only under constrained by the available uhecr data , in this context only a clear uhe neutrino observation with a typical spectrum as in figure [ fig ] ( right panel ) can confirm ( or falsify ) the model .",
