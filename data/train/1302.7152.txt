    "all stars with initial masses @xmath7 are expected to end their lives as core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) . in the last decade , the direct observation of the progenitors of ccsne in fortuitous pre - explosion imaging , has become an integral step in the study of all nearby events .",
    "the majority of the success in the actual detection of progenitors has been for the red supergiant ( rsg ) precursors to hydrogen - rich type ii plateau ( iip ) sne .",
    "the ensemble of progenitor detections and detection limits for these rsgs , however , presented a conflict with the theoretical expectation from stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "the `` red supergiant problem '' refers to the apparent absence of progenitors of type iip sne with mass @xmath8 , whereas the theoretical expectation is that stars with masses up to @xmath9 should end their lives as rsgs .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite considered the role of circumstellar dust , which is otherwise not probed by the resulting sn or the surrounding stellar population , as a possible solution to the rsg problem . in particular , @xcite established that the amount of circumstellar dust , and hence reddening , is larger for higher luminosity rsgs , that arise at the upper end of the mass range for stars to explode as type iip sne . in the case of sn  2012aw ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed a significant difference between the reddening determined towards the progenitor and the reddening inferred towards the subsequent sn ; suggesting a significant amount of dust was associated with the progenitor and that it was destroyed in the sn explosion , such that it could not be measured post - explosion . @xcite and @xcite also considered the additional possibility that the nature of the reddening , due to a circumstellar dust component , was different to ordinary reddening laws appropriate for the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a further issue with the rsg problem is that the maximum mass is poorly constrained , due to the paucity of progenitors with high inferred masses .",
    "this may reflect either a real deficit of high mass progenitors ( i.e. that the upper mass limit for stars to explode as type iip sne is low ) or may be due to low numbers of high mass progenitors according to the initial mass function ( imf ) . the exact articulation and quantification of the rsg problem",
    "is compounded by the reliance on , generally , poor fortuitous pre - explosion images , limited detections in pre - explosion images in multiple filters , and ambiguity as to whether the object observed at the sn position is indeed the progenitor object .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that it is possible , using deep late - time images that are tailored ( in a way that the pre - explosion images , by their fortuitous nature , can not be ) to observe the site of a given sn and overcome the severe limitations of analysis on just the pre - explosion images alone . using image subtraction techniques , such as isis",
    ", the late - time images can be used as templates , to both demonstrate the disappearance of the progenitor candidate ( confirm the original identification ) and conduct precise photometry ( without contamination from nearby and underlying objects ) .",
    "here we present a new analysis of five previously identified progenitor candidates using newly acquired late - time hst advance camera for surveys ( acs ) wide field channel ( wfc ) imaging .",
    "these progenitors are for sne 1999ev , 2003gd , 2004a , 2005cs and 2006my , and details of these sne are presented in table [ tab : obs : sne ] .",
    "the analysis of the pre - explosion hst observations of the sites of the five target sn progenitors has been previously presented by @xcite ( 1999ev ) ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( 2003gd ) ; @xcite ( 2004a ) ; @xcite and @xcite ( 2005cs ) ; and @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( 2006my ) .",

    "the pre - explosion observations acquired with wfpc2 were drizzled together following the standard procedure .",
    "these images were produced for the purposes of image subtraction ( see section [ sec : obs : sub ] ) . in parallel , a separate `` reduction '' and photometric analysis was conducted on the same data using hstphot @xcite . for sn  2005cs , pre - explosion images were acquired with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) wide - field channel ( wfc ) .",
    "these images were acquired using a four - point box dither pattern .",
    "alignment between the images was checked using the pyraf task _ tweakshifts _ , and the images were combined using _",
    "multidrizzle_. due to the half - integer pixel shifts of the dither pattern it was possible to enhance the spatial sampling of the final image , providing a final pixel scale of @xmath18 .",
    "this is larger than exact half - sampling ( @xmath19 ) , but is used to match the sampling achieved for the late - time acs wfc images of sn2005cs ( see section [ sec : obs : late ] ) .      for the purposes of this study , the principal interest in the immediate post - explosion images ( acquired up to 3 years post - explosion ) was to provide a position for the sn relative to the surrounding stars , such that the sn position could be identified on the pre - explosion and late - time frames through differential astrometry .",
    "the `` reduction '' procedure for these images was the same as outlined for the pre - explosion observations ( see section [ sec : obs : pre ] ) .",
    "late - time observations of the sites of four of the target type iip sne were acquired using the hst acs wfc 1 for the program go-11675 ( pi maund ) .",
    "the wfc chip was windowed to an array of @xmath20 pixels to reduce the readout time and mitigate the role of charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) .",
    "observations were conducted in three filters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "importantly , for two sne ( 2003gd and 2004a ) the use of the @xmath1 filter in these late - time observations _ does not _ match the pre - explosion images acquired with the wider @xmath21 filter . in the pre - explosion frames ,",
    "the majority of the flux from the progenitor at these wavelengths is representative of the continuum ( requiring a small @xmath22 colour correction ) . at late - times",
    ", however , the @xmath21 filter encompasses the wavelength of @xmath23 , which is a characteristic emission feature of late - time type iip sn spectra . a more appropriate comparison between before and after continuum fluxes is , therefore , achieved with the @xmath1 filter although ,",
    "as discussed below , corrections for the slightly different filter transmission functions also need to be considered .",
    "each of these late - time observations is composed of four separate sub - exposures acquired in a 4-point box dither pattern .",
    "this arrangement was used to permit the acquisition of better spatial sampling of the point - spread function ( psf ) and for removal of fixed hot - pixel features .",
    "the pyraf task _ multidrizzle _ was used to drizzle each of the sub - exposures ( for a given filter ) together .",
    "the task _ tweakshifts _ was used to fine - tune the alignment between each of the sub - exposures prior to drizzling .",
    "although the 4-point box dither pattern employs half - integer pixel shifts , potentially giving an improvement of spatial sampling by a factor of 2 , the presence of aliasing ( alternating bands across the frames ) prohibited reaching this final pixel - scale .",
    "this phenomenon was relatively insensitive to the choice of the drizzling kernel . instead the final pixel scale is greater than one half of the original @xmath24 pixel scales of acs / wfc ( @xmath25 )",
    ".    for sn 2006my , observed for program go-12282 ( p.i .",
    "d. leonard ) , the late - time images were only acquired in two bands ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . for each filter ,",
    "two exposures were acquired , for the rejection of cosmic rays , but at the same pointing such that no spatial resampling was possible .",
    "these images for each filter were combined using _ multidrizzle _ , but with the output images having the original acs / wfc pixel scale ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "a series of transformations were calculated for the complete datasets to determine the positions for objects in a common reference frame .",
    "geometric transformations were calculated between the pre- , post - explosion and late - time @xmath1 images ( or , if unavailable , @xmath2 images ) using the iraf task _ geomap _ , assuming only simple offsets , rotations and scalings . for the data at a given epoch ,",
    "shifts between images with other filters and the corresponding reference @xmath1 image were calculated by cross - correlating these images with the @xmath1 image as the reference frame .",
    "the cross - correlation was facilitated using the pyraf task _ crosscor _ , with the corresponding shifts calculated using _",
    "shiftfind_.      for wfpc2",
    "pre - explosion images the hstphot package @xcite was utilised to conduct psf - fitting photometry of the input images .",
    "hstphot provides the appropriate corrections for aperture size and charge transfer inefficiency , as well as tools for conducting artificial star tests .",
    "we note that hstphot only provides aperture corrections to a final aperture size of @xmath27 . using the corrections of @xcite",
    ", we apply a term to correct to the photometry to an infinite aperture .    for data acquired for program go-11675 ( pi maund )",
    ", principal photometry was conducted using iraf daophot on the final output drizzled images with the enhanced spatial sampling .",
    "we used the latest zeropoints appropriate for acs wfc .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated for each image to an aperture of @xmath27 , with a further correction to infinity adopted from @xcite .",
    "a key concern for the fidelity of the derived photometry is the inefficiency of charge transfer ( cti ) for charged coupled detectors on hst .",
    "as photometry was conducted on the drizzled , subsampled images , evaluating the magnitude of the cti on the final photometry is non - trivial and is based on the position of a given star on the original undrizzled , distorted _ flt _ images .",
    "geometric transformations were calculated between the final drizzled images and the @xmath28 images , using 3rd order polynomials in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , using _",
    "geomap_. this approach was used , over using a simple pre - computed distortion table , as non - negligible shifts were found between the expected pointings in the dither pattern .",
    "the positions of stars on the output drizzled images were transformed to the corresponding locations on each of the four constituent _ flt _ images .",
    "following @xcite , we conducted small aperture ( 3px ) photometry on the individual _ flt _ images and used the measured flux and sky background values to calculate the magnitude loss due to cti following the analytic prescription of @xcite . prior to conducting aperture photometry ,",
    "the _ flt _ images were scaled with the corresponding pixel area map . for a given star",
    "it might be only possible to calculate the magnitude loss for 1 or 2 of the input _ flt _ images , because of the relative positions of bad pixels or cosmic rays .",
    "an average cti loss ( as a magnitude ) was determined over the four constituent _ flt _ images and applied to the photometry derived from the drizzled images .",
    "in addition , photometry of the acs images was also conducted using the dolphot package .",
    "we utilised two implementations of dolphot for photometry of the acs data : dolphot with the acs module on the distorted _ crj _ and _ flt _ frames ( which we refer to as dolphot/_acs _ ) and dolphot as a generic photometry package for the distortion - corrected drizzled frames .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our daophot photometry and the photometry derived using hstphot and dolphot , within the limits of the photometric uncertainties .",
    "similarly to hstphot , the acs photometry was corrected from a @xmath27 to an infinite aperture , using the corrections tabulated by @xcite    the data for sn 2006my were analysed separately using only the hstphot and dolphot packages for the wfpc2 and acs data , respectively .",

    "is not clarified in the late - time imaging , the progenitor of sn  1999ev should no longer be considered in progenitor population statistics . in the analysis presented by @xcite , the progenitor of sn  1999ev had the distinction of having the highest mass inferred for a detected type iip sn progenitor , and so set the maximum mass limit for stars to explode as rsgs and produce type iip sne . with the removal of the sn 1999ev progenitor from the population statistics ,",
    "the maximum mass limit will actually drop and make the `` red supergiant problem '' even more severe .",
    "the late - time imaging of the site of sn  2006my has shown that the progenitor was detected in the pre - explosion observations , and the upper mass limit quoted by @xcite should now be quoted as a detected progenitor with a corresponding mass estimate .",
    "the mass estimates derived for the confirmed progenitors are generally higher ( by @xmath132 ) than those presented by @xcite ; in part , due to the slightly larger foreground and host reddenings we inferred towards the progenitors from the colours of the surrounding stars .",
    "in addition , for sn  2003gd and 2005cs we considered additional reddening components to the reddening from interstellar dust , in keeping with the expectation that there is dust local to progenitor that is not probed by the surrounding stars or the observations of the sne .",
    "we also note that our uncertainties are smaller than those quoted by @xcite : we considered the effects of uncertainties of the luminosity convolved with the flat probability distribution of the star having a mass in the range bounded by the maximum mass star to end core he - burning at that luminosity and the minimum mass star to begin ne burning at that luminosity .",

    "the two detections of the progenitor of sn  2003gd , at different wavelengths , enabled similar constraints for reddening due to circumstellar dust .",
    "conversely , the analyses of sn  2004a and 2006my were limited by them having only a single detection and only loose constraint on the progenitor colour at a bluer wavelength .    due to the lack of constraints on reddening due to circumstellar dust , the final derived masses for the progenitors of sne 2004a and 2006my may represent , in actuality , lower mass limits . for this study , we have assumed the circumstellar dust follows the reddenings laws proposed by @xcite , for the case of the progenitor of sn  2012aw .",

    "for sn  2012aw @xcite , the progenitor was detected in four bands , and the degeneracies between reddening , reddening law and temperature could not be broken ; suggesting the full determination of the parameters , independent of the assumptions of reddening laws , requires detections at @xmath136 wavelengths , such as for the progenitor of sn  2008bk @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite noted the large decrease in reddening determined for the pre - explosion source and for the subsequent sn ; suggesting such large reddenings may affect all progenitors but not be apparent post - explosion . for their sample of rsgs ,",

    "* and references therein ) that the amount of dust in the circumstellar medium is related to the mass loss rate of the rsg and , ultimately , its bolometric luminosity .    a corresponding issue to the reddening problem is the temperature .",

    "it is only in the poorly constrained cases , for the progenitors of sne  2004a and 2006my , that we can not exclude cooler temperatures that might be associated with massive agb stars . with limited observations in the optical ( in particular the @xmath138 and @xmath139 bands ) , it is difficult to place limits on the maximum temperature of the progenitor , as hotter temperatures can always be accommodated with additional reddening . in the case of the progenitor of sn  2005cs ,",
    "the requirement that the progenitor ended its life as an rsg has serious implications for the interpretation of the subsequent sn as a low luminosity `` electron - capture '' sn @xcite .",
    "our late - time imaging campaign has shown that , for the case of sn  2003gd , the possibilities of recovering precise photometry of the progenitor through template subtraction may be undermined by rebrightening of the sn at late - times . in the case of sn  2003gd , the previous analysis of @xcite was fortuitous in that it managed to observe the sn before it rebrightened with a very strict brightness limit of the sn in the late - time @xmath140 image .",
    "such rebrightening is not without precedent ; @xcite observed the optical lightcurve of sn  2004et to rebrighten ( by @xmath141 mag in @xmath139 ) at optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : ana:06my ] , the apparent discrepancy between the position of the progenitor of sn  2006my on the pre - explosion images and the transformed sn position does raise questions about how positional uncertainties are handled .",

    "it must be noted , however , that these centring techniques are not providing _ independent _ estimates of an object s location . in the future , it may be preferable to choose a single centering technique , and consider the role of poisson noise ( both object and background ) and read out noise in each pixel on the determination of an object s position .",
    "furthermore , tests using the centroiding routines in both the daophot and sao image ds9 packages has shown that , in the case of isolated objects in subsampled images , centroiding can be a relatively blunt tool ( providing default positions located in the centre of pixels ) . in considering flux deficits using image subtraction techniques , rather than appealing to astrometric coincidence , we have shown that confirmation of a star as being the actual progenitor requires observing it to have disappeared .",
