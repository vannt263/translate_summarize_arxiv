    "in our current understanding of the universe galaxies evolve within dark matter halos during the expansion of the universe . very successfully , the theory of hierarchical clustering and merging of dark matter halos explains the structure on large scales and the variety of galaxy masses and types observed . yet , on smaller scales the details of dissipation , star formation , and secular evolution , which also depend on non - gravitational forces , become more important and need to be addressed .",
    "observations and detailed modeling is required to help understand the processes of galactic evolution .",
    "our own galaxy is particularly important in this respect , because it allows much more detailed observations , down to stellar proper motions around the central black hole and planet formation around young stars .",
    "many new large surveys of the visible matter inventory of the milky way are under way : the survey rave hopes to measure radial velocities and chemical abundances of the brightest 50 million stars , the space interferometry mission sim will accurately determine the distance to the galactic center and the local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity , and glimpse , a spitzer legacy science program , already built a catalog of 47 million sources in the longitude range @xmath0 within the galactic plane @xmath1 , to be extended to fill the gap within @xmath2 .",
    "the goal of these surveys is to understand the milky way s present state and formation history @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of the milky way is required to make sense of these data sets .",
    "because of our position within the galactic plane , we can not grasp the large - scale structure easily . with certain symmetry assumptions , however , it is possible to recover the present 3-dimensional structure . in the following ,",
    "we review the steps necessary for deriving such a model .",
    "traditionally , mass models for the milky way have been constructed from parametrized analytical descriptions of the individual components : bulge , thin and thick disk , bar , and halo .",
    "the most successful axisymmetric model was published by @xcite who used iraf data to describe the stellar matter distribution .",
    "later @xcite used the cobe / dirbe near - infrared maps of the inner galaxy to fit a tri - axial bulge and double - exponential disk to the near - ir data .",
    "this approach was so successful  for the first time the bar of the milky way was directly seen  that a number of more detailed studies were triggered . however , any division into components is to some degree arbitrary , and parametric models have serious limitations .",
    "another route was taken by @xcite , who generated a large number of bar forming n - body models . by selecting the model closest to the observed cobe / dirbe light distribution he was able to reproduce the observations .",
    "the method is limited by the number of models one can generate ; and there is no guarantee that and how well the milky way fits in the space spanned by the n - body models evolved from the chosen initial conditions .",
    "a more generic approach was adopted by @xcite and @xcite , who developed and applied new non - parametric methods , to fit the observed near - ir light distribution as measured by cobe / dirbe .",
    "both methods require the specification of an initial model which is subsequently adjusted to simultaneously minimize the deviations from the observations , smoothness and penalty term . with some reasonable symmetry assumptions ,",
    "these methods yield the approximate 3-dimensional light distribution of the inner galaxy on a model grid which can then be analyzed to extract parametric information , such as disk scale length or bar axis ratio and radial extent .",
    "when adding a gaseous component , the bar in this model can drive spiral arms similar to the observed spiral pattern .",
    "however , a more realistic treatment of the spiral arms was introduced by @xcite who allowed for deviations from triaxial symmetry , and added an analytical spiral arm model known to fit the observed spiral arm pattern rather well , and took it into account when inverting the light distribution .",
    "interestingly , a model with spiral arm contribution to the cobe / dirbe light makes the deduced bar longer and more elongated compared to models without spiral arms .",
    "furthermore , only a model with spiral arm contribution can produce the observed asymmetries in the red clump line - of - sight distributions @xcite .",
    "this result demonstrates how important it will be to combine different data sets from different observations .",
    "the modeling results depend to some extent on the assumed solar galactocentric radius @xmath3 and local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite reviewed measurements of @xmath3 and found @xmath5 , while more recently @xcite estimated the distance to the galactic center black hole to be @xmath6 , still with a relative error of @xmath7 .",
    "the lsr velocity is then inferred from hipparcos data , coming out to be @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "most of the uncertainty comes from the @xmath3 error .",
    "a new analysis , taking into account previously ignored systematic effects , was published by @xcite showing that the lsr velocity might be lower , only @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand found a higher value from the proper motion of sgr  a@xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "here we assume a solar galactocentric radius @xmath12 and a lsr velocity @xmath13 .",
    "assuming a spatially constant mass - to - light ratio , the nir luminosity model can be converted to a mass model . in reality , the mass - to - light ratio of a stellar population depends on age and metallicity of the underlying stellar population , which would vary within the milky way , but these dependencies are weaker than in the optical .",
    "the luminous galaxy is probably embedded in a dark matter halo , which makes the circular rotation curve flat in the outer parts . combining the luminosity model and the constant @xmath14 assumption for the stars with an analytical model for the dark matter distribution ,",
    "a mass model can be constructed with only a few free parameters : the mass - to - light ratio for the visible component(s ) , the position angle of the bar , the pattern speeds of bar and spiral pattern , and the halo model parameters .",
    "for the invisible dark matter halo , we assume a logarithmic density profile with two parameters : scale radius @xmath15 and velocity @xmath16 .",
    "we find below that the details of the assumed profile do not matter , as long as the rotation curve of the dark halo is proportional to radius within the region probed by the data , i.e. inside @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the dark matter halo model truly has only one free parameter , the slope at small radii @xmath17 , where @xmath15 can be anything larger than @xmath18 .",
    "co data from @xcite , and hi data from @xcite ) .",
    "the lower dotted curve corresponds to the visible light contribution . for this fit",
    ", we assume @xmath12 and solve for the lsr velocity .",
    "the fit is required to match zero terminal velocity at @xmath3 and the only free parameters varied are the halo velocity scale @xmath16 and the mass - to - light ratio for the visible matter , which depends weekly on the assumed @xmath16 . by adjusting @xmath16",
    "we were able to match the observed terminal velocity curve ; the lsr velocity for this fit is @xmath19 , in agreement with observations .",
    "[ talk3 ] ]    the combined total rotation curve can be compared to the observed terminal velocity curve of the gas .",
    "when we assume that the luminous matter in the milky way has the maximal @xmath14 allowed by the terminal curve , and a dark matter halo scale radius of @xmath20 , the best fit is obtained with @xmath21 .",
    "the result can be seen in fig .",
    "[ talk3 ] .",
    "the deviation for @xmath22 is due to the bar which forces the gas on non - circular orbits . at larger radii ,",
    "the agreement is very good , and apart from two small humps at 4  kpc and 6  kpc , the model fits as well as the scatter in the data allows . when the orbital motion of the sun is added to the model s terminal velocity curve , we obtain the rotation curve in fig .",
    "[ talk4 ] .",
    "one sees that the contribution of dark matter inside @xmath3 in the model is less than the contribution of visible matter .    .",
    "[ talk4 ] ]    from fig  [ talk3 ] we see that a surprisingly good fit to the data is obtained when the contribution of visible matter is maximized and a constant mass - to - light ratio is assumed .",
    "additional evidence for this result comes from microlensing statistics obtained for selected fields within the bulge .",
    "the luminous mass model is only marginally able to reach the high microlensing optical depth measurements  @xcite .",
    "increasing the dark matter component in the model would lower the model s predictions of the microlensing optical depth , and thus increase the discrepancies with the experimental results even more .    turning the analysis around",
    ", we can assume that we got the contribution of the visible matter to the rotation curve right , and then calculate the rotation curve of the dark matter halo , i.e. what is left for the dark matter after subtraction of the known visible matter ( see fig .",
    "[ talk7 ] ) .",
    "the data up to @xmath3 are taken from fig",
    ".  [ talk3 ] , and those beyond @xmath3 are taken from @xcite and @xmath4 assumed here . ] who derived them from the hi layer thickness .",
    "clearly , within the solar orbit , the dark matter halo contribution to the rotation curve rises approximately linearly with radius . at small radii ,",
    "the data again are strongly affected by non - circular motions in the bar potential .",
    "the data seem to suggest that we start to see the turnover , and that the halo scale radius is @xmath23 , but the scatter in the data points beyond @xmath3 is quite large .",
    "moreover , @xcite criticized that the increased scatter and apparently linear rising rotation curve beyond the solar radius can be explained naturally , if tracers beyond @xmath3 are concentrated in a ring at @xmath24 . if @xcite are correct , this would imply that lower values for the halo scale radius @xmath15 are also possible .     and @xmath25 .",
    "all these models fit the data inside @xmath12 equally well . beyond @xmath3 , we show data from @xcite scaled for the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 used here .",
    "this figure demonstrates that data beyond @xmath3 is crucial for distinguishing between different halo mass models . the rotation curve for the visible matter",
    "is overlaid for comparison ( dotted line ) .",
    "[ talk7 ] , scaledwidth=98.0% ]    the analysis so far has assumed that the gas motions can be approximated by circular orbits .",
    "however , in the bar region ( @xmath26 ) this is not the case and at larger radii we may have significant perturbations due to spiral arms or orbit family changes at resonances . a more detailed analysis",
    ", however , is possible with gas dynamical models which take these factors into account .",
    "the most important orbital families in the galactic plane of a barred galaxy are the so - called @xmath27- and @xmath28-orbits .",
    "the former exist inside the corotation resonance ( cr ) , where one rotation of the bar takes as long as one circular orbit period .",
    "the @xmath27-orbits are shaped by the periodic forcing of the bar and are in phase and elongated with the bar .",
    "the @xmath28-orbits are perpendicular to the bar and typically almost round .",
    "they exist between the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) and the center or between the two ilrs if present .",
    "lindblad resonances happen when the epicycle frequency is twice the difference between the pattern speed and orbital angular speed . inside corotation we can have typically one or two ilrs ; outside corotation there is always a single outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) . between cr and olr ,",
    "orbits are again elongated perpendicular to the bar but almost circular in shape .",
    "the @xmath27-orbits are considered main building blocks of the stellar bar , because they support the bar potential .",
    "they are also responsible for the sharp peak in the milky way s terminal velocity curve @xcite .    using the atomic hydrogen and molecular gas emission all sky surveys , which not only provide terminal velocity data for the inner galaxy , but also information about spiral arm tangents , etc .",
    ", we can use hydrodynamical models to find further constraints for the mass model .",
    "given the mass model , one can find quasi steady state gas flow solutions by assuming some equation of state for the gas and solving the euler equations . here , the equation of state is assumed to be isothermal with a sound speed of @xmath29 ; and for the modeling we use a 2-dimensional smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "artificial viscosity in the code is used to simulate shocks properly .",
    "the background potential is split into three components : axisymmetric , bar , and spiral arms .",
    "the bar and spiral arm components rotate with fixed pattern speeds @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "initially , the gas is set up as an exponential disk on circular orbits in the axisymmetric part of the potential .",
    "the non - axisymmetric forces due to bar and spiral arms are introduced slowly in the model to avoid transient features .",
    "the resulting gas flow is stationary in the rotating frame of the bar if bar and spiral pattern speeds are identical , or periodic if they differ . for a given set of model parameters , longitude - radial velocity diagrams for the gas",
    "are then computed as would be measured by an observer rotating with the lsr , from which we obtain the model terminal velocity curves .    for the case of a single pattern speed ,",
    "the model is evolved until the gas flow is almost stationary in the bar frame of reference . for the case of separate pattern speeds for the bar and spiral patterns , the time step corresponding to the gas flow closest to the observed gas flow",
    "is found by comparison with the observed atomic and molecular gas kinematics . @xcite",
    "have shown that the terminal velocity curve can then be well understood in the context of gas on orbits typically found in barred galaxies . their gas dynamical model in the barred milky way model potential fits the observed terminal velocity very well",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ gasterm ] ) .",
    "note , that the high peak at @xmath32 is explained by non - circular motions in the bar potential and is matched better in models with higher numerical resolution .",
    "the whole process is iterative , because changing the position angle of the sun with respect to the bar major axis requires recomputation of the mass model with the corresponding symmetry assumption , and recomputation of the gas flow in the modified potential .",
    ", scaledwidth=98.0% ]",
    "the best near ir model of @xcite has a 3-dimensional bar with axis ratios @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the angle between the bar major axis and the line from the sun to the galactic center is @xmath35 , with the bar s near end at positive longitudes .",
    "the corresponding mass distribution , however , contains no direct information about dynamical parameters such as pattern speeds . if we can assume that the milky way s bar and spiral patterns each rotate with a constant angular speed for at least a few rotations , and that the gas flow reaches a quasi - steady state , then a comparison of the model with the observed gas flow can yield constraints on the current values of both pattern speeds in the milky way .    in the gas dynamical model",
    "we observe spiral arms that cause large deviations from circular velocity within corotation and only small deviations outside corotation of the bar . in the milky way",
    ", there is the so - called 3-kpc - arm which extends to @xmath36 in radius and has strongly non - circular motions . on the other hand ,",
    "the so - called molecular ring material between @xmath37 appears to be on nearly circular orbits .",
    "thus we can place corotation between those limits ; in the following we set the corotation radius to @xmath38 .    from observations and models of other barred galaxies",
    "it is known that the corotation radius is typically @xmath39 times the radius of the bar ends @xcite .",
    "larger values would be possible if the bar were able to slow down @xcite .",
    "our corotation derived above is consistent with the condition @xmath40 , however , if the bar length turns out to be underestimated , we would need to increase the corotation radius accordingly .",
    "@xcite found evidence from local stellar streams that the olr of the bar is located very close to the sun , according to @xcite , at @xmath41 .",
    "if so , we can calculate the corotation radius for our model and find @xmath42 .",
    "this is in good agreement with our previous estimate .",
    "the gas dynamical model in the barred mass model without spiral arms forms a 4-armed spiral pattern similar to the one deduced from h  ii - regions by @xcite ; see @xcite for the comparison .",
    "@xcite used the more realistic spiral arm model of @xcite to improve the inversion of the inner galaxy , and @xcite found the approximately periodic gas flow in this modified potential , assuming separate pattern speeds , for the bar and spiral arms .",
    "( right ) . [ multipat1 ] ]     diagrams for models with fast ( 60@xmath43 ; top ) and slow spiral arms ( @xmath44 ; bottom ) as shown in fig .  [ multipat1 ]",
    ". only the slow model shows low density voids ( marked as v ) similar to those known from observations .",
    "[ multipat2 ] ]    when we allow two pattern speeds in the model , i.e. the spiral pattern is given a different pattern speed from that of the bar , then the gas flow is changing in a periodic fashion with the beat frequency @xmath45 .",
    "this periodic oscillation is strongest in the transition region between bar and spiral pattern around the bar s corotation .",
    "because of the lower pattern speed , the spiral pattern extends to larger radii ; its outer radius is approximately given by its olr .",
    "distant faint gaseous spiral arms have been found out to radii to the galactic center . ] of 1216  kpc @xcite , and even 1722.6  kpc @xcite . however , it could well be possible that the outermost spiral arms are transient and do not follow the same pattern speed . hence , it is not practical to use the radial extent to estimate the spiral arm pattern speed .    in the model with two pattern speeds ,",
    "most of the time the spiral pattern beyond bar corotation smoothly connects to the inner spiral pattern driven by the bar  ( fig .",
    "[ multipat1 ] ) . however , because of the different pattern speeds , the outer spiral arms regularly separate from the bar - driven inner arms around corotation . on the other hand ,",
    "when spiral pattern and bar rotate with the same pattern speed , the spiral pattern weakens in the corotation region and disappears .",
    "this is consistent with density wave theory , which asserts that density waves become evanescent in the region around corotation , and decay .",
    "when two pattern speeds are used , we observe in the model that the spiral pattern passes through the bar s corotation and through the spiral arms corotation radius without weakening .",
    "a detailed comparison of the model with the observed gas flow shows that certain gas poor regions in the observed longitude - radial velocity diagram correspond to inter - arm regions in the gas flow near cr which only exist in the corotation region when spiral arms and bar rotate with different pattern speeds ( fig .",
    "[ multipat2 ] ) .",
    "the observed gas dynamics clearly shows such gas poor regions , hence the spiral arms must rotate more slowly than the bar @xcite .",
    "approximate agreement with observations is found when a pattern speed of @xmath44 is assumed for the spiral arms .",
    "detailed observations by @xcite of the spatial separation of spiral arms and young star clusters that have moved away from their spiral arms , also indicate not only that the spiral pattern rotates much slower than the bar , but also that multiple pattern speeds are present in the spiral pattern which fall into two groups around @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this observational result is also in agreement with the theory of lin & shu ( 1964 ) and a general result from n - body simulations of disk galaxies , namely that spiral arms are in fact not steady - state but recurrent and multiple modes overlap each other ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this review , we gave an overview of the results obtained from reconstruction of the present state of the milky way using near - ir luminosity and gas kinematics complimentary data sets .",
    "from the luminosity data alone , one could not infer anything about the dark matter component .",
    "likewise , the observed gas kinematics alone is difficult to interpret and has lead historically to wrong conclusions , such as steep drops in the inferred rotation curve , large dark matter components , and explosions in the galactic center .",
    "we avoid using parametric models for describing the important bulge region which is best described as a barred bulge .",
    "this bar in the galactic center explains the observed asymmetry in the near - ir light distribution within the bulge region as well as the high non - circular gas motion inside 3 kpc galactocentric radius .",
    "the inferred mass density is in good agreement with micro - lensing optical depth observations which provide an important independent test .",
    "the molecular ring material , is interpreted as four tightly wound spiral arms in approximate circular rotation outside the corotation radius of the bar .",
    "models indicate that the spiral arm pattern rotates much slower than the bar , allowing the arms to extend beyond the solar orbit .",
    "most imporantly , the model has provided evidence for the maximum disk hypothesis and the amount of dark matter present inside the solar radius .",
    "future and presently ongoing observational surveys will provide even more detailed data which will allow us to improve the model further .",
    "the next revision of the milky way models will probably allow more detailed studies of the spiral arms and locate more resonances .",
