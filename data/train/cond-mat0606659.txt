    "the possible existence of charge and spin inhomogeneities and their relevance for the low - temperature physics of cuprates superconductors is a long - standing problem , not yet completely clarified .",
    "@xcite in particular , the issue is twofold : on one hand , one is interested to understand the low - energy behavior of microscopic models and the possibility to have or not inhomogeneous phases in physically relevant regions ; on the other hand , it is also important to clarify the possible relation between charge or spin inhomogeneities and the electronic pairing , which may lead to an high critical temperature for superconductivity .",
    "the original interest in the role of these inhomogeneities dates back to the works by emery and kivelson  @xcite and raised when neutron scattering experiments  @xcite suggested the possible formation of conducting hole - rich regions separated from hole - poor ones with strong antiferromagnetic moments .",
    "indeed , in most materials , the presence of a true phase separation ( ps ) instability is ruled out by the existence of the long - range coulomb force that prevents the charge to accumulate in macroscopic regions ,  @xcite only allowing the possibility to have a mesoscopic charge segregation , i.e. , charge density waves ( cdw ) or the celebrated stripes . in the last decade ,",
    "a great number of direct and indirect evidences for such charge segregation has been presented in different cuprate and nickelate materials , stimulating theoretical investigations in simple microscopic models .",
    "@xcite several authors addressed the possibility of the emergence of ps or cdw generating from the competition between the kinetic energy , that tends to delocalize the charge carriers , and various local interactions ( like for instance the on - site coulomb repulsion , the antiferromagnetic super - exchange or the coupling with some local phonon ) , that instead tend to freeze the electrons .",
    "given the complexity of the strongly correlated problem , that contains different energy scales , it is very difficult to study its ground - state and low - energy properties .",
    "for instance , by considering mean - field approaches it is very easy to overestimate the tendency of charge segregation .",
    "@xcite in this respect , a great advantage of the variational monte carlo technique is that it allows one to consider highly correlated wave functions , which are well beyond simple mean - field ansatz .",
    "@xcite then , it would be very important to compare the validity of the ansatz considered with exact ground - state properties on fairly large system sizes , since the variational approach may fail , especially for low - energy properties .",
    "this is possible only for bosonic non - frustrated models by means of quantum monte carlo projection techniques and for fermion systems the so - called sign problem prevents one to reach the exact zero - temperature properties in a stable way . nevertheless , very well established and efficient approximate approaches are known for fermionic systems , that considerably improve the quality of a given variational guess .",
    "for instance , the so - called fixed node ( fn ) method ( see below for a detailed description of the method on lattice models ) allows one to obtain the lowest - energy state constrained to have the same signs of a given variational wave function .",
    "therefore , the fn scheme provides a simple procedure to assess the stability of a particular variational wave function , its accuracy being related to the differences between its properties and the ones obtained with the improved fn state .    in this paper",
    ", we will revisit the problem of the ps instability in the @xmath0 model on the square lattice .",
    "this issue has been largely considered by several authors in the recent past .",
    "@xcite although , a great effort has been done , a general consensus for @xmath4 and small hole doping @xmath5 is still laking",
    ". the @xmath0 model is defined by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 indicates the nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath10 on the site @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the spin operator , @xmath13 , being @xmath14 the pauli matrices , and @xmath15 is the density operator .",
    "we consider a square lattice with @xmath16 sites and periodic boundary conditions rotated by 45 degrees such that @xmath17 , @xmath18 being an odd integer , so that the non - interacting ground state is non - degenerate at half filling , thus reducing the finite - size effects .",
    "finally , @xmath19 is the antiferromagnetic exchange constant and @xmath20 the amplitude for nearest - neighbor hopping . in the following",
    "we will take @xmath21 .",
    "for very large @xmath22 , at small hole doping , the ground state is phase separated between undoped regions , with long - range antiferromagnetic correlations , and conducting hole - rich regions .",
    "the simple explanation is based on the fact that the magnetic gain in accumulating the holes in a given region of space is much larger than the loss of the kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , a phase separated state will have a lower energy than an homogeneous one . by decreasing @xmath22 , the situation is much less clear , since the magnetic gain becomes comparable with the kinetic one .",
    "emery , kivelson , and lin ,  @xcite by using simple variational arguments , claimed that the ground state of the @xmath0 model should phase separate for all values of the antiferromagnetic coupling and close to half filling .",
    "this claim was firstly confirmed by using a more sophisticated monte carlo technique  @xcite , but then disclaimed by other authors , using slightly different monte carlo approaches and series expansions .",
    "@xcite in particular , two of us showed that , by filtering out the high - energy components of a projected bcs wave function , it was possible to obtain an homogeneous ground state for @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite later , this approach was questioned in ref .  , since it was noted that the ground state is still unstable against ps for very small hole doping , where our numerical approach had technical problems . in particular , it has been shown that monte carlo results could indicate an instability for @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , it was disappointing that it was not possible to define a stable variational wave function and that an homogeneous state was obtained only after the filtering procedure .",
    "from all the calculations done by different numerical techniques , it is now clear that , in any case , the @xmath0 model for @xmath24 is on the verge of charge instabilities , and both ps or cdw can be stabilized with small perturbations .",
    "@xcite    a key issue that was absent in previous calculations and must be included in a correct description is the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations at low doping .",
    "recently , by using a variational approach that contains both antiferromagnetism and d - wave pairing , ivanov  @xcite suggested that the antiferromagnetic ordering could enhance the instability towards ps .",
    "however , in his approach , the presence of an antiferromagnetic order parameter in the fermionic determinant without the presence of a jastrow term to take into account spin fluctuations implies a wrong behavior of the spin properties at small momenta , that in turn could also induce incorrect charge properties .",
    "in fact , by using a spin - wave approach for the heisenberg model , it has been shown  @xcite that an exceptionally accurate description of the ground state is obtained by applying a long - range spin jastrow factor to the classically ordered state .",
    "in the corresponding variational wave function it is important that the gaussian fluctuations induced by the jastrow term are _ orthogonal _ to the direction of the order parameter , in order to reproduce correctly the low - energy excitations .",
    "a simple generalization of this wave function was used to study the hubbard model at half filling and for low doping .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it is well known  @xcite that a projected bcs state with @xmath25 symmetry and no antiferromagnetic order provides an accurate wave function for the low - doping region of the @xmath0 model and remains rather accurate in energy even at zero doping , where a magnetically ordered ground state is well established in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , in order to have an accurate variational ansatz to describe lightly doped correlated insulators , it seems natural to include both antiferromagnetic correlations and electronic pairing .",
    "@xcite    following these suggestions , we construct a very accurate variational wave function that describes an energetically stable homogeneous phase .",
    "moreover , by considering th fn approach , we have a strong evidence in favor of an homogeneous ground state for @xmath3 for all the accessible hole doping .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ wavefunction ] we present the improved variational wave function and the fn method , in sec .",
    "[ results ] we show our numerical results , and finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the variational state and the generalized fn method that is used to filter out its high - energy components .",
    "our variational ansatz is constructed by applying different projector operators to a mean - field state : @xmath26 is the gutzwiller projector that forbids double occupied sites , @xmath27 is the projector onto the subspace with fixed number of @xmath28 particles , @xmath29 is a spin jastrow factor @xmath30 being @xmath31 variational parameters , and finally @xmath32 is a density jastrow factor @xmath33 being @xmath34 other variational parameters .",
    "the above wave function can be efficiently sampled by standard variational monte carlo , by employing a random walk of a configuration @xmath35 , defined by the electron positions and their spin components along the @xmath36 quantization axis",
    ". indeed , in this case , both jastrow terms are very simple to compute since they only represent classical weights acting on the configuration .",
    "the main difference from previous approaches is the presence of the spin jastrow factor and the choice of the mean - field state @xmath37 , that includes both superconducting and antiferromagnetic order parameters .",
    "actually , @xmath37 is taken as the ground state of the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath38 where , in addition to the bcs pairing @xmath39 ( with @xmath40-wave symmetry ) , we also consider a staggered magnetic field @xmath41 in the @xmath42 plane : @xmath43 where @xmath41 is a variational parameter that , together with the chemical potential @xmath44 and the next - nearest - neighbor hopping of eq .",

    "this fact would indicate that , for this value of @xmath22 , the fn hamiltonian  ( [ fnham ] ) has an higher tendency towards ps than the original @xmath0 model . in this case , the mixed average of eq .",
    "( [ mixedav ] ) is slightly biased , and this bias can be eliminated by considering the actual expectation value of the @xmath0 hamiltonian over the fn ground state . in doing this ,",
    "we approach the exact result ( by improving the energy ) and an homogeneous phase , with a monotonically increasing energy per hole , is obtained . within this more accurate scheme ,",
    "we substantially improve our previous results that were based on the mixed average of the fn approximation and that indicated a rather high critical doping .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , within our numerical approach , it is very difficult to study the possible formation of hole droplets close to the ps instability , as suggested by poilblanc .",
    "@xcite indeed , this would require a very delicate size scaling of the binding energy of few holes , which is beyond our present possibilities .    by further increasing the super - exchange coupling",
    ", we eventually enter into the ps region : for @xmath107 , the energy per hole has a rather deep minimum at finite doping and also the expectation value  ( [ fnextrap ] ) clearly indicates a non - monotonic behavior , see fig .  [ fig : emeryj08 ] .",
    "boundary for the phase separation ( ps ) instability .",
    "the results of previous works are also shown for comparison .",
    "the line is a guide to the eye.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , it is important to stress that very similar results can be also obtained by considering the density - density correlation function @xmath147 in this case , since @xmath148 is a diagonal operator in the configuration space , it is easy to compute its average value over the fn ground state by using the so - called forward - walking technique .  @xcite this quantity is therefore free from possible bias coming from mixed averages .",
    "the ps instability is signaled by the divergence at small momenta of @xmath148 . in our previous paper ,  @xcite we reported the calculations of this quantity , showing the presence of a finite-@xmath1 peak , linearly depending upon the doping , close to the ps instability . here , thanks to the accuracy of the guiding function and the progress in stabilizing the statistical implementation of the fn technique , we are able to present much more accurate results that confirm the previous ones . indeed , the existence of this peak is due to the closeness of the ps : figs .",
    "[ fig : nq8holes ] and  [ fig : nq16holes ] show the evolution of @xmath148 by increasing @xmath22 for two values of the doping , near the insulating regime .",
    "in particular , we obtain the evidence for a stable homogeneous phase for @xmath2 , confirming the indications given by the analysis based upon the energy per hole",
    ". then also the progressive development of a huge peak around @xmath149 for @xmath150 is in good agreement with the energy calculations .",
    "all together , these results allow us to draw our final phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , where we report , for comparison , also some of the previous estimations for the ps boundaries .",
    "we have revisited the problem of the ps instability in the @xmath0 model . by generalizing the pfaffian wave function introduced some time ago ,  @xcite we have defined a very accurate variational state that , for the first one to our knowledge , is stable against ps at low doping . in particular , we have shown the necessity to consider both an antiferromagnetic order parameter ( in the fermionic determinant ) and a spin jastrow factor , to mimic the spin fluctuations . in this way",
    "all the low - energy properties of the exact ground state are correctly reproduced .",
    "then , by using a more sophisticated monte carlo technique that can filter out the high - energy components of a given trial wave function , we can obtain the ground state of an effective hamiltonian and , at the same time , assess the stability our initial guess .",
    "so , we have shown that for @xmath60 , the ground state does not phase separate at any hole doping down to @xmath132 , giving a serious improvement on the possible ps boundaries at small @xmath22 . remarkably , the analysis based on the energy per hole is also corroborated by the calculation of the static density - density correlations .",
    "the phase separation , in the low doping region , appears at a critical antiferromagnetic coupling slightly larger than the value given in ref .",
    ", namely here we find @xmath151 .",
    "although future improvements in the monte carlo technique or in the accuracy of the variational wave function may lead to an higher coupling , it looks unlikely to reach the critical point recently obtained by high - temperature expansion,@xcite i.e. , @xmath152 .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : slope26 ] , our present accuracy in the energy per hole is about @xmath153 and its slope is almost correct .",
    "this holds rather independently of @xmath22 and system sizes , at least for the clusters where exact results are available . for @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : emeryj08 ] ) , the minimum of the energy per hole implies an energy gain for the inhomogeneous phase of about @xmath154 per hole , i.e. , comparable with our maximum possible error estimated before .",
    "thus we expect that @xmath155 can not be much larger than @xmath156 even for a numerically exact method .",
    "moreover , we have obtained that , in contrast with what was found in the hubbard model , the compressibility stays finite by approaching the mott insulator . a simple explanation of a finite compressibility in two dimensions is obtained by by assuming that the holes form hole pockets around the nodal points [ i.e. , @xmath157 and behave as spinless fermions , implying that @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the spatial dimension . in this simple scenario",
    "the compressibility is divergent only in one dimension , whereas it is finite in two dimensions , and should approach zero in three dimensions , leading to a more conventional metal - insulator transition .",
    "the stability against phase separation of a wave function with explicit antiferromagnetism and d - wave superconducting order parameter provides new insights for understanding the phase diagram of the high - temperature superconductors .",
    "remarkably , in the clean system , possibly idealized by the @xmath0 model , the antiferromagnetism and the d - wave order parameter should not exclude each other , at least at the variational level , and actually cooperate to decrease the energy and lead to a stable homogeneous phase .",
