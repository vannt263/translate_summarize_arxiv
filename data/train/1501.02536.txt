    "see methods for fock - state postselection . to investigate the questions posed above , we compare two different detection schemes : either all four detectors are placed at mode @xmath3 only , which is used for the detection of ( 2,0 ) or ( 4,0 ) photons in modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 [ fig .",

    "the enhancement factor , i.e.  the ratio of the counts at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , amounts to 1.93@xmath100.02 . on the other hand , single - photon detection at both output ports , i.e.  ( 1,1)-detection , is conducted by two - fold coincidence detection by d@xmath5 and d@xmath11 in the configuration of fig .",

    "we observe a typical hong - ou - mandel dip  @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data](b ) , with a width of @xmath12 fs , which is very close to @xmath13 . as we shall show later in the analysis",
    ", this equality perfectly matches the theoretical expectation .",
    "a qualitatively different picture is encountered for four - photon interference . as described above",
    ", a two - photon fock - state is injected into each input mode ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and the four photons are detected under two different schemes : ( 4,0)-detection [ fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](a ) ] and ( 3,1)-detection [ fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) ] .",
    "the ( 4,0)-signal presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : data](c ) exhibits a peak with a width of @xmath14 and an enhancement factor of 5.3@xmath100.8 , in agreement with the value 6 expected for four - photon bunching  @xcite .",
    "the width is comparable to the two - photon width , with @xmath15 .",
    "the ( 3,1)-signal , on the other hand , exhibits a dip , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data](d ) , since the four - photon path amplitudes that lead to ( 3,1)-events interfere destructively  @xcite .",
    "the width of the ( 3,1)-detection signal amounts to @xmath16 fs , the ratio of the widths is @xmath17 .",
    "clearly , the dip in the ( 3,1)-signal is significantly narrower than the peak in the ( 4,0)-signal , while the widths of the two - photon interference signals coincide , regardless of the detection scheme .",
    "we stress that these different widths result only from the choice of different detection events , since any other conditions such as spectral filtering are the same .",
    "the width of multi - photon interference signals is usually interpreted as the coherence time of the interfering photons , but our above observations show that a four - photon state can not be assigned a unique coherence time . in stark contrast to two - photon quantum interference , the choice of the observed detection event becomes relevant for the shape of the observed signal , as our subsequent analysis explains .        * theoretical analysis . * for a quantitative understanding of the observed behavior , we operationally define the indistinguishability @xmath18 between two photons with time delay @xmath2 via the overlap of their amplitudes , ( ) =    @xmath19 is a creation operator for a photon arriving at the bs centered at time @xmath20 .",
    "two photons are fully indistinguishable for @xmath21 and fully distinguishable for @xmath22 ; for most quantum states , such as the frequently encountered gaussian states ( see methods ) these cases are attained for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "when an ( @xmath23)-photon fock - state enters at each input mode of a bs , the state of the delayed photons in mode @xmath1 can be decomposed into a superposition of @xmath24 states , each term consisting of @xmath25 distinguishable and @xmath26 indistinguishable photons with respect to any photon in mode @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "each term that describes @xmath4 distinguishable photons at mode @xmath1 , together with the ( @xmath27/2)-photon fock - state in mode @xmath0 , is denominated of @xmath4-@xmath28 .",
    "the weight of each type is a function of @xmath18 up to a power of @xmath23 . as a result ,",
    "the overall detection probability for the @xmath29 outcome is a polynomial in @xmath18 with a maximal power @xmath23 , p^(n;n - m , m)()&=&_k=0^n/2 c_k^(n;n - m , m )  ( ) ^k , [ eq : expprob ] as explained in more detail in the methods section .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]        with equation  ( [ eq : expprob ] ) at hand , we can understand the observed two - photon and four - photon interference signals : the different detection schemes in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] result in distinct multi - particle interference paths @xcite , and , consequently , in distinct coefficients @xmath30 , as shown in table [ table : coeff ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting signals differ . in order to model the observations",
    ", we need to account for the gaussian frequency distribution of the photons in our experimental setup .",
    "we denote the resulting width of the indistinguishability @xmath18 [ equation  ( [ eq : indistinguishability ] ) ] by @xmath31 , the width of higher orders @xmath32 is then reduced by a factor of @xmath33 ( see methods ) . for two - photon interference",
    ", only the linear contribution @xmath18 contributes to the detection probabilities ( table [ table : coeff ] ) ; thus , both @xmath34 and @xmath35 exhibit the same width , and a unique coherence time can be assigned to the two - photon state .",
    "when four photons interfere , quadratic terms proportional to @xmath36 emerge in the detection probabilities . for @xmath37 , both @xmath18 and @xmath36 contribute , but the linear term has a larger pre - factor , such that it dominates the overall behavior .",
    "consequently , the signal width is only slightly reduced with respect to two - photon interference , it amounts to approximately @xmath38 , in good agreement with the measured value @xmath15 . on the other hand , for @xmath39 only the quadratic term @xmath36 contributes and the resulting width amounts to @xmath40 , which is significantly narrower and coincides well with the experimentally observed value @xmath17 .",
    "in other words , the second - order power of the indistinguishability @xmath18 determines the width of the multi - photon signal , and induces the hierarchy @xmath41 .",
    "when the number of interfering photons is increased further , higher orders of the indistinguishability become relevant . in @xmath27-photon interference ,",
    "up to @xmath23-th order effects of the indistinguishability emerge in equation  ( [ eq : expprob ] ) , and each @xmath42-th power of the indistinguishability leads to a signal with a particular width .",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 , which are determined by the chosen detection scheme @xcite , then regulate which power of the indistinguishability dominates the sum , and determine the observed multi - photon coherence time .",
    "therefore , no unique coherence time can be assigned to a multi - photon state .",
    "the dependence on the detection scheme is an innate property of multi - photon states @xcite , which takes place irrespective of the specific shape of @xmath18 .    in particular",
    ", the multi - photon coherence time associated with the detection of @xmath43 decreases with increasing number of photons @xmath27 . for the gaussian frequency distribution",
    ", the ratio @xmath44 converges to the asymptotic value @xmath45 ( see methods ) , shown as a red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : reduc ] . on the other hand , coherence times related to the detection of the @xmath46-signal",
    "typically increase with the number of photons @xmath27 . as an example , see the widths of the @xmath47-signal and of the @xmath48-signal for odd @xmath23 , and the @xmath49-signal for even @xmath23 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reduc ] .",
    "the increase of the signal width can be understood from the strong interference that is exhibited by a fock - state interfering with a single photon @xcite : the @xmath50-distinguishability type describes such a state with exactly one indistinguishable photon , which naturally features strong interference . with increasing particle number @xmath27 ,",
    "the ( @xmath51)-distinguishability type becomes not only broader , but also more influential .",
    "in general , the widths of @xmath52 and @xmath53-signals exhibit opposite tendencies for increasing number of photons @xmath27 , and the dependence of the observed multi - photon coherence times on the chosen event becomes more and more dramatic as more photons interfere .",
    "in conclusion , the possibility to measure the _",
    "single_-photon coherence time via the width of the _ two_-photon interference signal turns out to be rather accidental : we have shown in experiment and in theory that the multi - photon coherence time , as defined by the width of the observed multi - photon signal , is not unique .",
