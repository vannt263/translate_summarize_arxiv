    "increasingly , many complex systems are being modeled as networks since the framework of nodes representing the basic elements of the system and the interconnections of the network representing the interaction between the elements fits well for a theoretical study .",
    "when the complex systems are large - dimensional dynamical systems , the network framework comprises many interacting subsystems of smaller dimension each of which constitutes a node . as a particular example , the whole or a portion of the entire neuronal activity in the human brain can be regarded as the consequential dynamics of interacting subsystems , where the dynamics of a subsystem is generated by a group of neurons .",
    "the enormously interconnected subsystems in the brain generate a wide variety of dynamical patterns , synchronised activities and rhythms .",
    "epilepsy is a disorder that affects the nerve cell activity which in turn intermittently causes seizures . during such seizures",
    ", patients could experience abnormal sensations including loss of consciousness .",
    "clinical and theoretical research have shown that underpinning the cause of this disorder has not proved to be easy , in particular the predicament of resolving the question as to whether the disorder manifests due to the nature of the interconnections in the brain or the pathologicity of a portion of the brain tissue itself remains .",
    "since epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders with an estimate of more than 50 million individuals being affected @xcite , there is a strong need both for curative treatment and as well for the analysis of the underlying structure and dynamics that could bring about seizures . in this paper , our attention is on focal epilepsy where the origin of the seizures are circumscribed to certain regions of the brain called the seizure focus @xcite , and the aim of this paper is to foster theoretical investigation into the connection strengths of the underlying nodes in such a seizure focus in comparison to the other nodes in the network .",
    "different models have been proposed to understand different aspects of focal epilepsy @xcite .",
    "mathematically speaking , dynamical system models of focal epilepsy studied in the literature are mainly of two broad categories : ( i ) .",
    "models that consider noise to be inducing seizures in a node @xcite ( ii ) .",
    "models that consider seizures to be caused or terminated by a bifurcation , a change in the intrinsic feature of the ( autonomous ) dynamics at the node @xcite .",
    "while modeling the neuronal activity of the human brain , there are far too many numerous parameters which also dynamically evolve on separate spaces and scales , and it is unrealistic to observe or encapsulate all these aspects in a static network or an autonomous dynamical system ( see appendix  [ appendixaa ] ) . since the brain evolution does not depend on its own internal states as it responds to external stimuli and the interconnections in the brain are likely to change in response to stimuli , the human brain can be safely said to be a nonautonomous system and in the language of network dynamics , this is effectively an evolving network ( see section  [ sec_sfn ] ) .    besides evidence that network connections play a role in initiating seizures ( e.g. , @xcite ) , some authors also provide evidence that stronger interconnections play a role in epileptic seizures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , a commonly found feature of biological systems is adaptation : an increase in exogenous disturbance beyond a threshold activates a change in the physiological or biochemical state , succeeded by an adaptation of the system that facilitates the gradual relaxation of these states toward a basal , pre - disturbance level .",
    "based on all these , we present a novel phenomenological model where seizures could be activated in a node , if certain interconnections change to have larger weights resulting in a larger exogenous drive or disturbance or energy transmitted from other nodes into it , and upon experiencing seizure , adjustment of interconnections takes place eventually to subside the seizures . since the interconnections are allowed to change , the model dynamics emerges from an evolving network .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a patient and data - specific , macroscopic , functional network model that can act as a  surrogate \" representation of the electroencephalography ( eeg ) or electrocorticography ( ecog ) time - series .",
    "the network model is new in the sense that it satisfies the following simultaneously : the network connections are directed and weighted ; the network connections are time - varying ; there is a discrete - time dynamical system at each node whose dynamics is constantly influenced by the rest of the network s structure and dynamics ; the ability of the network to generate a time - series that sharply resembles the original data is based on a notion of robustness of the dynamics of the network to its initial conditions what we call as the  state - forgetting \" property .",
    "the essence of the state - forgetting property , roughly put is that the current state of the brain does not have an",
    " distinct imprint \" of the brain s past right since from its  genesis \" or  origin \" ( rigorous definitions are provided later in the paper ) .",
    "effectively , this means that the brain tends to forget its past history as time progresses .",
    "such a notion has been adapted from the previously proposed notions for studying static ( artificial neural ) networks with an exogenous input in the field of machine learning viz .",
    ", echo state property @xcite , liquid state machines , @xcite , backpropagation - decorrelation learning,@xcite and others .",
    "however , the network model that we represent is very different from that of the artificial neural networks and moreover the nodes in our model correspond to different regions of the brain .",
    "our methodology is as follows : we present an evolving network model which exhibits state - forgetting property for all possible inter - connections , and a particular sequence of interconnection strengths ( matrices ) is determined from a given eeg / ecog time - series so that the model can almost regenerate the time - series .",
    "the weights of the interconnections are chosen from a set of possibilities based on a heuristic algorithm that infers a causal relationship between nodes  a ( directed ) synchrony measure between two nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 represents the conductance ( ease at which energy flows ) from node @xmath1 into node @xmath0 , and weight of the connection from node @xmath1 into node @xmath0 has some degree of proportionality with the synchrony measure .",
    "the state forgetting property ensures the synthesized evolving network has in some sense captured the original time series as an  attractor \" ( see @xcite and proposition  [ prop_pullback ] ) , and hence the network acts as surrogate representation of the original time series .",
    "in other words , since any initial condition presented to a state - forgetting network has no effect on its asymptotic dynamics , and that the asymptotic dynamics resembles the time - series , we assume that the evolving network model has captured the essence of the time - series data .",
    "to indicate the potential utilities of the model , we analyse the constructed evolving network from a patient s clinical data . by comparing the relative strength of the interconnections ,",
    "we identify nodes that are outgoing hubs of the network as a theoretically determined seizure focus .",
    "the nodes in such a focus have a strong location - wise correlation with the set of nodes in a clinically determined seizure focus .",
    "we also , discuss the efficacy of surgical removal of the determined focus in subsiding seizures .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we introduce the notion of state - forgetting evolving networks in section  [ sec_sfn ] ; formal definitions are made in appendix  [ appendixa ] . in section  [ sec_model ] , we present the evolving network model in detail and state a result concerning the state - forgetting property ; the complete mathematical proof of this result is presented in appendix  [ appendixb ] . in section  [ sec_weights ] ,",
    "we present a method to obtain the weight matrices to obtain a time - varying network from a clinical time series . in section  [ sec_results ]",
    ", we present some results on the network inference followed by a brief discussion and conclusion in section  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "the aim of this section is to give an intuitive description of the state forgetting property of evolving networks ; the formal and rigorous definitions of this property are found in appendix  [ appendixa ] .",
    "we employ discrete - time systems @xcite since they are more amenable to computer simulations as the computed orbits or solutions unlike in the case of differential equations do not depend on numerical methods for computing the solutions and their related accuracy .",
    "also , discrete - time systems can exhibit complex dynamical behaviour ( e.g. , @xcite ) even in one - dimension whereas a continuous time - system needs a dimension of at least three .    using fig .",
    "[ fig_3nodes ] , we present a less formal and simplistic description of an evolving network with three nodes @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a @xmath4 matrix defined for each integer @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the strength of the incoming connection from node @xmath1 to node @xmath0 ; here @xmath6 is the element in the @xmath7 row and @xmath8 column of @xmath3 .",
    "there is a discrete - time dynamical system at each node in the evolving network represented in fig .",
    "[ fig_3nodes ] , and the @xmath7 node dynamics is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is some function ( not dependent on @xmath5 ) that calculates @xmath11 using information from the dynamical state in the three nodes at time @xmath5 and the respective incoming strengths into node @xmath0 . by specifying @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 together with the sequence of weight matrices @xmath3 ,",
    "the evolving network is specified completely . by denoting @xmath15",
    ", we can represent the evolving network dynamics also as a nonautonomous system @xmath16 , where the variation of @xmath17 with @xmath5 represents the inherent plasticity of the system ( change in @xmath3 above ) .",
    "we can also allow @xmath17 s to represent external stimuli to the network and other obfuscated factors .     from node @xmath18",
    "since an evolving network is essentially a nonautonomous system , we recall some relevant results of a nonautonomous system . of interest to us",
    "is the notion of an entire - solution of a nonautonomous system .",
    "an entire solution ( or orbit ) of a nonautonomous system @xmath19 is a sequence @xmath20 that satisfies @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "it is possible to show under natural conditions that there exist at least one entire solution @xcite . in the particular case , where the evolving network has a unique entire solution",
    ", we say that the network ( or the nonautonomous system ) has the state - forgetting property ( formally defined in definition  [ def_sf ] ) .",
    "now , we comment on the rather intriguing consequence of an evolving network @xmath19 having multiple entire - solutions .",
    "suppose @xmath20 and @xmath23 are two distinct entire - solutions of a nonautonomous dynamical system , then for some time @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 i.e , the system could have evolved into two possible states at time @xmath26 . since @xmath27 and @xmath28 , it is necessary to have @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , @xmath29 would necessitate @xmath30 and so on .",
    "thus , in general , at any time - instant @xmath26 , @xmath25 implies that there are two entire - solutions that have had distinct infinitely long pasts . in other words , the dynamics of such systems with distinct entire - solutions  depends \" not only on the inherent plasticity or",
    "the exogenous stimuli represented by the maps @xmath19 , the distinct solutions carry a distinct and non - vanishing imprint of their past .    from the arguments in the preceding paragraph , for nonautonomous systems like the human brain , having more than one entire solution translates to saying that the current state of the brain is not just the result of the changing interconnections in the brain or the exogenous input but to also say that its past states have a non - vanishing effect on the asymptotic dynamics .    since it is hard to envisage or believe that seizures in current time had something to do with the state of the brain right from its  genesis \" ( genesis is used as a metaphor to refer to the earliest factual time instant from which the current brain state has evolved from , and this time could be matter of debate ) , we assume the more plausible  seizures at a certain time are a consequence of how the network structure has evolved / changed till that time or a result of a stream of exogenous inputs to the brain , but certainly not a consequence of the state at which the brain was in during its genesis .",
    "this also forms the basis for employing echo - state networks in artificial neural network training and machine learning@xcite .",
    "whenever a nonautonomous system ( technically , defined on a compact state space ) has the state - forgetting property , it also has state - space contraction towards its entire - solution in the backward direction ( see proposition  [ prop_pullback ] ) .",
    "in fact , a stronger result @xcite holds : if @xmath31 is the unique entire solution , then for every @xmath32 the successive iterates @xmath33 would satisfy @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , @xmath31  attracts \" all other state - space iterates towards it ( component - wise ) as time tends to infinity .",
    "this convergence due to the attractor property of the state - forgetting property is what makes our evolving network model generate a time - series that actually sharply resembles ( mathematically , converges to ) the data from which the network was conceived .",
    "further discussion on attractivity is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the larger point is that for an evolving network to be of utility as a surrogate representation of the time - series data , we need the state - forgetting property .",
    "before , we actually describe the evolving network model in , we list and describe its features : * ( i ) . * the evolving network model has @xmath36-nodes for all time . *",
    "( ii ) . * placed at each node is a certain bi - parametric one - dimensional discrete - time dynamical system which is autonomous when there are no incoming connections from other nodes to it , and nonautonomous otherwise .",
    "we refer to the dynamics of the system at a node , as the dynamics of the node or nodal dynamics . * ( iii ) . * among the two parameters that specify this one - dimensional dynamical system is a stability parameter .",
    "the nodal dynamics in autonomous mode has a globally stable fixed point at @xmath37 whenever the stability parameter is in a certain range ( stable - regime ) ; a globally stable fixed point attracts all solutions , i.e , the time series values measured in the node are close to @xmath37 and tend towards to it . * ( iv ) .",
    "* when the stability parameter is chosen not to lie in the stable regime , the autonomous nodal dynamics can render a range of different behaviours including oscillatory behavior , complex behavior like chaos @xcite depending upon the value of the stability parameter . *",
    "* when the nodal dynamics is nonautonomous , the dynamics of the node is perturbed at each time - instant from the dynamical states of other nodes . we call the net perturbation from other nodes as the drive to the node under consideration .",
    "the exogenous drive from other nodes has its signature on the nodal dynamics , and if sufficiently strong , is also capable of setting the nodal dynamics far away from the fixed point @xmath37 . *",
    "* we term a seizure in the node to be a dynamical excursion away from the fixed point , and that the seizures in a node are brought about ( and terminated ) in two distinct scenarios : ( via ) . changing the stability parameter of the node in the autonomous mode of operation ( vib ) . by the nature of the exogenous drive from the other nodes in the network in the nonautonomous mode . * ( vii ) . * in this paper , we consider the case of nodal dynamics slipping into seizures as in scenario ( vib ) above , i.e , we consider each node to have its stability parameter to lie in the stable regime , and the exogenous drive to cause seizures .",
    "the drive is time - varying on two accounts : first , being a function of the states of the other nodes it is time - varying as other nodes have a dynamical system and not static ; second , the drive is time - varying since it is a function of the interconnection strengths of the nodes .",
    "our model is also motivated on the lines of previous research @xcite showing that the hyper - interconnected regions in the brain are prone to seizures ( see section  [ sec_model ] ) .",
    "hence , we expect the drive to an individual node is likely to be having large magnitude if it has large weighted incoming connections .    to describe a family of evolving networks ( as in definition  [ def_en ] ) , we first sketchily describe the nonautonomous dynamics at each node @xmath0 ( the map @xmath10 described in section  [ sec_sfn ] or in definition  [ def_en ] ) via the update equation : @xmath38 where the various entities are listed and briefly explained :    * the iteration of the map @xmath39 on an initial condition gives the autonomous dynamics of the node . some neuron models like that of fitzhugh - nagumo ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "permit an individual neuron to have a regenerative self - excitation via a feedback term .",
    "based on this principle , we consider a highly simplistic discrete time model of the node dynamics where feedback from the node dynamics can cause self - excitation , and set @xmath40 where parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( for a graph of @xmath39 , see fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) .",
    "explanation on how a parameter can cause self - excitation dynamics is made in section  [ sub_sec_isolated ] . * adopting the principle that the individual drive from a connecting node has a larger magnitude if the incoming connection weight and the magnitude of the state value of the connecting node are together larger , we set the total sum of the drives from the other @xmath43 nodes into the node @xmath0 to be @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath6 is the weight of the incoming connection from the @xmath8 node to the @xmath7 node ; @xmath46 is an offset parameter to enable a positive argument for the @xmath47 function ; @xmath48 is an increasing function and is defined by @xmath49 the function @xmath50 although increasing , has a monotonically decreasing slope ( see fig .  [ figc ] ) .",
    "the net effect of the function @xmath50 can be thought of as the node s mechanism to have a relatively stronger inhibition to a stronger incoming connection ",
    "node s internal mechanism to resist seizures by inhibiting stronger exogenous drive .",
    "lastly , the negative sign in is only for mathematical convenience and has no physical significance .",
    "when the drive is zero , the dynamics of the node @xmath0 is in autonomous mode .",
    "* the saturation function henceforth would be the mapping @xmath51 which is linear in a certain adjustable range , and its slope becomes zero asymptotically ( see fig .",

    "( see fig .",
    "[ figb ] ) ; @xmath54 is linear in the region @xmath58 with a slope @xmath59 , and the slope of @xmath60 approaches @xmath37 as @xmath61 monotonically according to @xmath62 .",
    "putting together the above into , the update equation at the @xmath7 node is modeled by : @xmath63    note that in the model in , the weights @xmath6 are unspecified , but they actually can be solved for given a ecog / eeg time - series @xmath31 ( topic of section  [ sec_weights ] ) . in section",
    "[ sub_sec_isolated ] and [ sub_sec_nonauto ] , we describe the dynamics of a node when it operates in autonomous node and in the nonautonomous mode . in section  [ sub_sec_thm ] , we state sufficient conditions on the parameters @xmath64,@xmath65 and @xmath66 , to ensure state - forgetting property of any evolving network arising out of .",
    "however , to understand the model , a few remarks are in order concerning the role of the offset parameter @xmath66 and the saturation function @xmath54 in :    from , it follows that the individual drive from the node @xmath1 into node @xmath0 , at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath67 . to make the role of the weights meaningful",
    ", a smaller weight @xmath6 should ensure smaller individual drive from node @xmath1 , i.e. , we must have @xmath68 close to zero whenever @xmath6 is close to zero .",
    "we note that this would be the case whenever the offset parameter @xmath66 is sufficiently large . to observe this , we remark on the behavior of @xmath68 as the weight @xmath6 gets close to zero . by definition of @xmath50 in ,",
    "when @xmath6 is close to zero , it follows that @xmath69 is close to @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath69 is close to @xmath70 , @xmath68 is close to @xmath71 . for practical purposes we restrict @xmath72 $ ] ( see section  [ sec_weights ] ) , and",
    "hence if @xmath66 is much larger than @xmath73 , then @xmath74 is close to @xmath59 , and @xmath71 is close to zero , and thus @xmath68 is very close to zero .",
    "however , it is also to be noted that if @xmath66 is made unreasonably large , the signature of @xmath73 on @xmath68 gets weaker , so @xmath66 is chosen in an appropriate range , although with a large value .",
    "physiologically , the parameter @xmath66 has no direct relation , but serves as a mathematical plug to overcome the difficulty in modeling the drive directly from the dynamical states of a connecting node that take both positive and negative values .",
    "the offset @xmath66 has another role : its value could determine the state - forgetting property of an evolving network ( see theorem  [ thm_main ] ) .    the particular choice of the saturation function @xmath54 is not critical to the model ; for the convenience of mathematical proofs , we need @xmath54 to be differentiable and unbounded and hence its form . on the other hand , for practical reasons ,",
    "choosing such a @xmath54 , helps in the simulation stage to troubleshoot if each of the parameters @xmath64,@xmath65 and @xmath66 are chosen in an appropriate range lest the network lose the state - forgetting property . while the network does not have the state - forgetting property",
    ", the dynamics can be unbounded in the absence of a saturation function since the range of @xmath39 is unbounded and the numerical values on a computer could indicate an error .",
    "we present a short summary of the dynamics of the family of maps @xmath39 described in .",
    "the detailed analysis of this family of maps is not the subject matter of this paper , and the discussion here is only intended to convey the point that the dynamics of @xmath75 adds notable features to the evolving network model .",
    "recall that the parameters @xmath76 are restricted to @xmath41 and @xmath77 . with @xmath78",

    "the dynamics of @xmath39 on @xmath79 is relevant to us since the dynamics outside @xmath79 escapes to @xmath82 . with @xmath64",
    "fixed , and increasing @xmath65 through @xmath37 to @xmath83 , the dynamics of this family of maps on @xmath79 takes a route to chaos qualitatively similar to the variation in @xmath65 from @xmath37 to @xmath84 in the well studied logistic family of maps @xmath85 on @xmath86 $ ] ( for e.g. , @xcite ) . elaborating this further , when @xmath87 , the fixed point is globally stable , in the sense that every orbit asymptotically approaches the fixed point as @xmath5 tends to @xmath88 ; when @xmath89 , the fixed point loses stability and undergoes a period doubling bifurcation . as @xmath65 is increased beyond @xmath90 , period doubling cascades occur alike in the logistic family of maps @xcite , and eventually there is a transition to chaos . thus each node has the potential to have self - excitatory dynamics ( oscillate or exhibit complicated behaviour ) if the stability parameter for the node @xmath65 is set between @xmath91 .      adding a time varying drive @xmath92 to the update equation of @xmath39 by    @xmath93 makes the mapping",
    "depend on @xmath5 , and clearly the graph of such a mapping at any @xmath5 is a vertically shifted version of the graph of fig .",
    "[ figa ] with the shift determined by @xmath92 . since",
    ", we expect @xmath92 to be changing with every @xmath5 , the stable fixed point dynamics is not a feature of nonautonomous dynamics . as mentioned above ,",
    "increasing @xmath65 beyond @xmath59 , makes the dynamics move away from the fixed point at @xmath37 .",
    "we make use of the fact that to move the nonautonomous dynamics away from the fixed point , it is not necessarily required to increase @xmath65 beyond @xmath59 , but a sufficiently strong drive is capable of moving the dynamics . also , some background observations and computer simulations suggest that larger the magnitude of drive , further away is the likelihood of the dynamics away from @xmath37 .      having made some points on the nodal dynamics , we now state a result on the evolving network .",
    "next , we state a theorem which says that when @xmath66 is sufficiently large , then any evolving network obtained from is state - forgetting .",
    "the complete proof of this result is provided in appendix  [ appendixb ] .",

    "we regard seizure spread in the network due to sustained energy transmitted from a node that is seizing to the ones which is not . with this principle",
    ", we hypothesize @xmath6 to be an increasing parametric function of a certain synchrony measure @xmath114 between the two distinct nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "physiologically , the synchrony measure between two nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 represents the ease at which energy dissipates ( a measure of conductance ) from node @xmath1 into node @xmath0 , and hence is directed  nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 could have different interconnections , and energy dissipation between nodes is not symmetric . to get a measure of such conductance , we let the synchrony measure @xmath114 depend on ( i ) a sustained influence from node @xmath1 into node @xmath0 measured by a leaky integrator placed between the two nodes ( ii ) the similarity between the average amplitude or power in the two channels up to time @xmath5 .    the algorithm for computation of directed synchrony @xmath114 between two channels is described in section  [ sub_sec_alg ] .",
    "we now explain the idea / reasoning behind some of the steps of the algorithm .",
    "the discussion can be read in conjunction with the various steps of the algorithm .",

    ", we compute the average power at each instant in a window of length @xmath116 in each channel ( see definition of @xmath117 in ( s6 ) of section  [ sub_sec_alg ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the time interval in which there is sustained influence of one node on the other by the synchrony measure is determined by @xmath116 .",
    "we comment on the choice of @xmath116 in section  [ sub_sec_practical ]    the directed synchrony @xmath114 depends on the product of two factors ( see ( s7 ) of section  [ sub_sec_alg ] ) .",
    "one of the factors is the similarity between the powers in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels which we quantify by a similarity index @xmath118 .",
    "note that due to normalisation in ( s1 ) , the average power @xmath117 in any window is between @xmath37 and @xmath59 , and hence @xmath119 , and the similarity index attains @xmath59 if and only if @xmath117 and @xmath120 are identical .",
    "the other factor that contributes to @xmath114 is @xmath121 , the output of a ( directed ) nonlinear leaky integrator placed between two distinct nodes and whose states are evaluated recursively ( for details see ( s8 ) to ( s12 ) of section  [ sub_sec_alg ] ) ) .",
    "the purpose of such a leaky integrator is to model the sustained influence of the signal strength in the node @xmath1 on node @xmath0  the word sustained points to the fact that the integrator leaks , and unless the influence is not sustained over a period of time , the influence diminishes .",
    "any such leaky integrator in ( s11 ) of section  [ sub_sec_alg ] is a nonautonomous dynamical system in its own right , and hence its future states are obtained by iteration on the current state .",
    "in essence , a leaky integrator sums up ( or integrates ) its previous state with what is fed to it typically as an input , but also leaks a small fraction of the sum while integrating . here , we set the leaky integrator dynamics for the connection from node @xmath1 to @xmath0 as @xmath122 where the cumulative average power @xmath123 in the @xmath8 channel is calculated as in ( s9 ) of the algorithm .",

    "the correlation of the mean incoming node strengths with the clinical seizure onset zone during the pre - ictal period can be understood as that the external drives from other nodes play a supportive role in initiating seizures ( a hypothesis of our model as well ) . since during the ictal period all channels seem to have similar average power due to seizures , all nodes are likely to receive a similar quantum of external drive .",
    "hence , the mean incoming drive strength appears to be uniform .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "fig : segmentation_eeg ] ( c , d ) shows that the distinctively higher mean outgoing node strength ( during both ictal and pre - ictal period ) is much strongly  correlated \" with the clinical seizure onset zone than that shown by the corresponding mean incoming node strengths .",
    "therefore , from fig .  [",
    "fig : segmentation_eeg ] ( c , d ) , it is evident that the nodes whose node strengths are shown as columns in red ( i.e. , nodes @xmath183 ) are the outgoing hubs .",
    "we refer to this set of nodes as the theoretical seizure onset zone .",
    "incidentally in this experiment there are 12 nodes in the theoretical seizure onset zone , similar in cardinality to the set of the nodes at the site of clinical resection ( i.e. , nodes @xmath184 ) .",
    "we refer to the nodes at the site of clinical resection as the clinical seizure onset zone .",
    "it is evident that the theoretical seizure onset zone and the clinical seizure onset zone point to very similar regions in the brain .",
    "thus , the model has the potential utility of identifying an approximate seizure focus zone prior to surgery by analysing some pre - ictal and ictal data .        although the theoretical and clinical onset zones differ slightly , from a theoretical standpoint of view , we can hypothesise the outcome of the surgical removal of these two zones and compare these outcomes if we have a suitable objective measure . to explain this ,",
    "let @xmath185 be the indices of the subset of the nodes that are omitted from a network of @xmath36 nodes in a simulation experiment , i.e , the nodes in @xmath185 are made non - functional by setting @xmath186 for all @xmath5 if either @xmath0 or @xmath1 belongs to @xmath185 .",
    "using such modified weight matrices in we can obtain a time - series @xmath187 of the depleted network can be calculated by starting with any initial condition that satisfies @xmath188 whenever @xmath189 . in other words ,",
    "the signal has to have zero amplitude in all the channels corresponding to the nodes in @xmath185 since they are assumed to not participate in the network dynamics .",
    "we quantify the efficacy of the removal of the nodes that belong to @xmath185 by calculating the ratio of the average power in those channels outside @xmath185 prior to removal of nodes and after it by : @xmath190 where @xmath181 denotes the number of samples over a time - interval @xmath179 and @xmath191 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath185 .",
    "similarly the average power in the signal generated from the depleted network can be calculated by @xmath192 and we calculate the efficacy of removing the nodes @xmath185 by the ratio @xmath193    we tabulate the values of @xmath194 below , where @xmath185 is determined by the following choices : ( i ) the clinical seizure onset zone ( ii ) theoretical seizure onset zone ( outgoing hubs ) ( iii ) an arbitrary set of 12 nodes ( iv ) 12 nodes randomly drawn ( average of @xmath194 is tabulated in this case ) .",
    "now , we discuss the potential application of the model in a clinical study when surgery is part of the treatment",
    ". the aim of a clinical surgery would be to a minimise the removal of tissue from the brain along with subsiding seizures post surgery . in our study",
    "above , the removal of a set of nodes @xmath185 from the evolving network is intended to simulate a surgical removal of the tissue beneath the nodes in @xmath185 . a time series @xmath187 from the depleted network is intended to simulate the resultant clinical ecog time series observed after surgery , and the quantity @xmath194 is meant to measure the efficacy of the surgery . thus prior to an actual surgery ,",
    "the theoretical efficacy of surgical removal of nodes can be studied by using the corresponding depleted network . from the tabulated values of @xmath194",
    ", we observe that the removal of nodes from the outgoing hubs that form the theoretical onset zone maximises the efficacy of a surgery when ( the tissue beneath ) a set with 12 nodes is assumed to be removed in each simulation .",
    "in fact the large value of @xmath194 obtained after the removal of the nodes in the theoretical onset zone translates to complete subsiding of seizures in the resultant time - series ( not shown here ) generated from the depleted network .",
    "when a small subset of the outgoing hubs were retained in the network , @xmath194 was still observed to be smaller and the seizures continued to persist from the resultant time - series ( not shown here ) generated from the depleted networks . from this ability of outgoing hubs to subside seizures in the rest of the network upon their omission , we also refer the outgoing hubs to as spreaders . for a reader interested in finding an optimal set of nodes for subsiding seizures , we note that one does not have to necessarily aim to get a very large value of @xmath194 , but any @xmath194 that yields a seizure free time - series is adequate .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we remark that in our simulations , the mean incoming ( outgoing ) node strengths and the mean incoming ( outgoing ) weights of a node exhibit similar variation across nodes , but we employ the former as it accounts for more accurate interaction between two nodes since it subsumes both the effect of the weight of the interconnection and the signal strength of the node that connects .",
    "the parameter @xmath116 determines the length of the windows in which average powers are compared ( in the algorithm in section  [ sub_sec_alg ] ) while computing the synchrony measure .",
    "since the power during the inter - ictal period ( period between two distinct seizures ) is negligible in all channels and seizures are relatively short epochs , if @xmath116 is made extremely large then the synchrony measures would not show distinct variation across nodes , and we could end up with no useful network information as the weights lose physical significance .",
    "it is required to set @xmath116 in a range so that some noticeable pre - ictal activity or larger power in the data that typically occurs ( e.g.,@xcite ) just prior to seizures is captured in the synchrony measure . in this paper , we set @xmath195 so that with a sampling rate of @xmath196 hz we use about 10 seconds of data for such a power comparison . however , it turns out that the mean node strengths show similar variation even if @xmath116 is increased in a range of up to @xmath197 , but a large @xmath116 increases computational complexity .    in conventional machine learning problems ,",
    "complicated models are avoided fearing an over - fitted model .",
    "an over - fitted network model is usually a static network with a very large number of nodes and it tends to model the random noise or anomalies in the data rather than the underlying relationship .",
    "we evaluate the sensitivity of the weight computation algorithm or the model by analysing the change in computed weights with additive artefact noise to the data ; we use weights rather than node strengths since we are analysing the model sensitivity and not evaluating a seizure focus . by adding realizations of zero mean iid noise having uniform distribution to the above analysed patient s clinical ecog data ( taking values in @xmath115 $ ] ) , we plot in fig .",
    "[ figic ] and fig .",
    "[ figoc ] the normalised average incoming and outgoing connections for different noise variances  the average weights are normalised to have a maximum average value of @xmath59 for the purpose of comparison across different noise variances .",
    "the pattern in the variation of the average weights has many similar features even when the noise variance is high ( fourth panel in fig .",
    "[ figic ] and fig .",
    "[ figoc ] ) .",
    "with such a high variance of noise , we observe from fig .",
    "[ figoc ] that all the nodes in the theoretically determined focus are still outgoing hubs .",
    "similar robustness of the pattern in normalised weights were observed when the data was quantised or when the parameters ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) in our algorithm were varied .",
    "[ figicoc ]",
    "lastly , we remark that the model is flexible to changes and can be modified to work as long as the state - forgetting property is satisfied . in particular , the dynamical system at each node in and inferring causality in the algorithm in [ sub_sec_alg ] can be made more sophisticated or changed to be based on a deeper or alternate physiological understanding of how epileptic seizures are generated .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a modeling approach to transform data into an evolving network that has the state forgetting property or robustness to initial conditions .",
    "although , this principle of transformation can be applied to data originating from any source , the particular evolving network model concerned an epileptic network .",
    "although time - series can be modeled with reasonable accuracy by static networks of very large dimension such as recurrent neural networks , the individual nodes in such case have no physical significance and they do not correspond to the regions in the brain .",
    "the interconnection - strengths between the nodes were solved via a causal relationship inferred from the sustained power similarity between two nodes .",
    "since the model can produce a sharp reconstruction of the time - series , there is flexibility to study the interconnections in the evolving network in conjunction with the value of the time series at any time point , or over a time - interval .",
    "we have observed from modeling clinical data of an epileptic patient that certain nodes turn into outgoing hubs during the pre - ictal period and persist through the ictal period .",
    "these outgoing hubs also have a location in the brain similar to that of the clinically identified seizure onset zone ( seizure focus ) .",
    "this hints that the ( pathological ) seizure causing areas in the brain could be having strong outgoing connections during seizure onset and during seizures .",
    "further , to quantify the influence of such outgoing hubs on the network dynamics , we have presented a result quantifying the theoretical efficacy of removal of such nodes in subsiding seizures .",
    "of course , the result is based on data of a single patient , but then a comprehensive study of the effect of a removal of any node in an evolving network has to be backed up with a justification  since altering even a single interconnection could alter the entire network dynamics , a reliable model should show small changes in the network dynamics for small changes in the weights . in a sequel paper , we present a mathematical justification for inferring network information from a depleted network where we establish that changing the interconnections results in a continuous change in the time series whenever the evolving network is state - forgetting . such a result is needed to justify a more detailed study of the theoretical efficacy of removal of nodes .",
    "in fact , it is possible to prove a very strong result showing that the effect of the removal of a node can be studied reliably if and only if a ` nontrivial ' evolving network has state - forgetting property .",
