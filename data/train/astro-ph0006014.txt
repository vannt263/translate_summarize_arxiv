    "we discuss here data from two of the instruments onboard _ bepposax _ @xmath7 : the medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) and the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) .",
    "the mecs ( boella et al .",
    "1997b ) is presently composed of two units , working in the 110 kev energy range . at 6  kev ,",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath16 and the angular resolution is @xmath00.7@xmath17 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the lecs ( parmar et al . 1997 ) , consists of an imaging x - ray detector , working in the 0.19 kev energy range , with 20@xmath18 spectral resolution and 0.8@xmath17 ( fwhm ) angular resolution ( both computed at 1 kev ) .",
    "standard reduction procedures and screening criteria have been adopted to produce linearized and equalized event files .",
    "the mecs ( lecs ) data preparation and linearization was performed using the saxdas ( saxledas ) package under ftools environment .",
    "the observed count rate for a3562 is 0.174@xmath190.002 cts s@xmath11 for the 2 mecs units and 0.133@xmath190.003 cts s@xmath11 for the lecs .",
    "here we note that the counts rate observed in the high energy instrument on board of _ bepposax _ @xmath7 , i.e. the phoswich detection system ( pds , 15200 kev ) , is consistent with zero and presents a 90 per cent upper limit of 0.13 cts s@xmath11 .",
    "considering the present status of the calibration of the _ bepposax _ instruments and following the suggestions in fiore , guainazzi , grandi ( 1999 ) , we have extracted a mecs spectrum , in the 210 kev band , and a lecs spectrum , in the 0.14 kev , both from a circular region of 8@xmath17 radius ( @xmath0 0.62 mpc ) , centered on the emission peak . from the _ rosat _ pspc radial profile , we estimate that about 70 per cent of the total cluster emission falls within this radius .",
    "the background subtraction has been performed using spectra extracted from blank sky event files in the same region of the detectors as the source .",
    "the counts are then grouped to be a minimum of 25 per bin to apply properly the @xmath20 statistics in the fitting analysis .",
    "the spectra from the two instruments have been fitted simultaneously with an optically thin thermal emission model ( mekal code in the xspec package ) , absorbed by a galactic line of sight equivalent hydrogen column density , @xmath21 , of 3.84 @xmath22 @xmath23 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) . a numerical relative normalization factor among the two instruments has been added to account for the slight mismatch in the absolute flux calibration of the mecs and lecs response matrices employed in this paper ( september 1997 release ) .",
    "the mecs vignetting is included in the response matrix thanks to the effarea program ( see molendi et al .",
    "1999 for details ) .",
    "for the lecs we have used two redistribution matrices and ancillary response files , the first computed for an on - axis pointlike source and the second for a source with a flat brightness profile .",
    "the temperatures and abundances we derive in the two cases do not differ significantly , as the telescope vignetting in the 0.14.0 kev energy range is not strongly dependent upon energy . as expected , the relative normalization factor is significantly different , 0.55@xmath190.02 in the case of the fit with the point source effective area , and 0.77@xmath190.02 in the case of the diffuse source effective area , where the effects of vignetting are included .",
    "the mekal model yields an acceptable fit to the data , @xmath24 229.1 for 210 d.o.f .",
    "( see figure  [ fig1sax ] ) .",
    "the best fitting values for the temperature and the metal abundance are 5.13@xmath25 kev and 0.39@xmath190.05 solar units ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the results obtained fitting the single spectrum of lecs and mecs .    from the best - fit results ( cfr .",
    "table  3 ) , we measure an un - absorbed flux of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) erg @xmath23 s@xmath11 in the 210 ( 0.12.4 ) kev band with a corresponding rest - frame luminosity of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) erg s@xmath11 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is @xmath30 erg s@xmath11 .",
    "the estimate of the _ bepposax _ broad - band gas temperature is not consistent with both the _ rosat _ and _ exosat _ estimates by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ( see section  2.2 and 3.2 ) . once the absorption in front of the thermal model is fixed to the galactic value , the _ rosat _ measurement provides a larger disagreement with the _ bepposax _ result . in particular , if we extrapolate the mecs results to the _ rosat _ energy band , we observe large deviations below 0.5 kev ( fig .  [ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "therefore , we select the pspc counts between 0.5 and 2 kev ( instead of 0.22.0 kev as done for the analysis presented in section  2.2 ) . doing this , the reduced @xmath20 value diminishes to 0.97 with 144 d.o.f .",
    "( the improvement is significant to the 87 per cent confidence level , using the f - test ) , but still the best - fit gas temperature remains low ( @xmath33 kev , 1 @xmath34 ; note that if we fix the parameters of the spectral fit to the best values obtained from the _ bepposax _ spectra @xmath35 kev , @xmath36 and galactic absorption the @xmath37 is 1.14 and can not be excluded at 0.05 significance level given the @xmath20 probability distribution ) .",
    "finally , if we fit the lecs spectrum between 0.2 and 2 kev , we obtain a reasonable good agreement with both the galactic absorption and the temperature estimate as measured from mecs data only ( cf . table  3 ) .    on the other hand , using the japanese - us satellite _ asca _ that operates in a similar energy band as the _ bepposax _ mecs instrument , hanami et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and white ( 2000 ) observe a gas temperature in a3562 of @xmath38 and @xmath39 kev , respectively , with a metallicity of about 0.3 times the solar value and fixing the absorption to the galactic value .",
    "moreover , white ( 2000 ) finds a statistical evidence ( 90 per cent confidence level ) that a cooling flow component is required from the _ asca _ gis spectra .",
    "including this component , the ambient gas temperature raises to @xmath40 kev .    about the _ exosat _ measurement , it is worth to note that the spectrum was obtained from the medium - energy array of proportional counters that has no spatial resolution and a quite large field - of - view of 45@xmath4145 .",
    "we have verified that the observation has been centered between a3562 and sc1329 - 313 , at ( ra , dec ) = 13@xmath42 32@xmath43 144 , 314122 , and covers only 65 per cent of the central circular region of the pspc centered on the cluster .",
    "therefore , a significant contamination from the cooler group of galaxies could have affected the measurement of the cluster temperature .    in principle",
    ", a possible explanation of this soft excess can be the fact that a3562 is located not far from the galactic center , @xmath44 ( 3133 , 304 ) , where the _ rosat _ soft band maps of snowden et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show a strong contribution from the galactic bulge and the snr / stellar wind bubble radio loop i. however , if this foreground contamination is homogeneous , diffuse and extended over the field of view of the exposition , the use of a local background should correct for this excess .",
    "we have tried to fit the _ rosat _ spectra with a two temperatures model , but we have not obtained any reduction of the @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , we do not observe any disagreement between the best - fit mecs results and the extrapolation to the lecs energy band ( note that the _ squares _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] are consistent with a constant value ) .",
    "finally , we note that the same trend of a lower value of the plasma temperature as measured from _ rosat _",
    "pspc than the estimate obtained from spectra collected by instruments with wide x - ray energy band ( e.g. mecs , _ asca _ gis and sis ) has been also observed in a3558 , the most massive cluster in the shapley region : from the pspc data , bardelli et al .",

    "second paragraph in section  3.2.1 ) .    at the penultimate radial bin , @xmath78 mpc , we measure a gas mass , @xmath79 , of @xmath80 , a total mass , @xmath81 , of @xmath82 , and a gas fraction , @xmath83 of @xmath84 .    using the results from the analysis of the surface brightness profile up to 1.51 mpc done with the @xmath51model",
    ", we can investigate the properties of a3562 at the representative radius @xmath85 , where the mean overdensity in the cluster is 200 times the critical density and the virial equilibrium within the cluster is reached . in detail ,",
    "the gas mass is given by the integration over the cluster spherical volume of the gas density represented from the @xmath51model , the total mass is obtained from the hydrostatic equilibrium between the cluster potential and the plasma ( see , e.g. , henriksen & mushotzky 1986 ) : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the central temperature in kev , @xmath53 the core radius in @xmath6 mpc , @xmath90 is the mean molecular weight in a.m.u . and",
    "the numerical values include the gravitational constant @xmath91 , the mass of the proton @xmath92 and all the unit conversions .",
    "finally , given this mass profile , @xmath85 is given by a simple analytic formula ( ettori 2000 ) .    under the isothermal assumption ( i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 kev ; see section  3.1 ) , @xmath95 mpc , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the gas fraction , @xmath98 , is @xmath99 .",
    "once a polytropic temperature profile is considered ( see best - fit results in section  3.2.1 ) and a proper correction is applied to the projected central temperature ( @xmath89 changes from the best - fit value of 6.19 kev to the deprojected value of 6.63 kev ; see markevitch et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath85 decreases to 1.79 ( @xmath190.05 ) mpc , the total mass at that radius is @xmath100 , the gas mass is @xmath101 , and the gas mass fraction is @xmath102 .",
    "it is worth to note that these values of the gas and total mass , and the relative gas mass fraction , are extrapolations of the observed masses profiles and are consistent at the 90 per cent confidence level with the results of the deprojection analysis over the radial range covered from the cluster emission .",
    "these estimates of the total mass are generally lower than the values quoted in quintana et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , where different estimators of the virial mass applied to the galaxy counts within 2 mpc provide values in the range @xmath103 \\times 10^{14 } m_{\\odot}$ ] . using the galaxy density distribution and the isothermal assumption , bardelli et al .",
    "( 1998a ) measure a total mass of @xmath104 at @xmath105 mpc .",
    "this disagreement can be due to the difficulty in disentangling the cluster properties only through optical analysis for the presence of mergers and contaminations that affect the estimate of the optical velocity dispersion and the definitions of the galaxy members .",
    "from the present analysis of the _ rosat _ pspc and _ bepposax _ data , we conclude that a3562 is a moderate rich cluster with a x - ray bolometric luminosity of @xmath106 erg s@xmath11 in a not - relaxed status , with evidence of merging and/or interaction along the west - east axis .",
    "the broader gas emission along that axis is consistent with the picture described by n - body and hydrodynamical simulations , in which the clumps , originally spherical , merge in a cigar - like shape structure that propagates the shock front in the outskirts and relaxes ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 in takizawa 1999 ) .",
    "this scenario is complementary and in support of the spectral analysis of the _ asca _ spectra presented by hanami et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the complex morphology of the cluster is also underlined from the comparison between the two @xmath54 values , one obtained from the spatial analysis , @xmath107 , and the other from the spectral and optical data , @xmath108 . representing the estimate of the same quantity , i.e. the ratio of the energies per unit mass stored in the galaxies and in the gas ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 )",
    ", these values should be equal at least in relaxed systems .",
    "however , deviations in the average values of @xmath107 and @xmath109 have been observed , rising the so - called @xmath51_problem _",
    "( mushotzky 1984 , edge & stewart 1991 , bahcall & lubin 1994 ) .",
    "this disagreement is observed more significantly in systems that present mergers and complex morphology .",
    "the case of a3562 confirms this tendency : given an optical velocity dispersion from bardelli et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and the x - ray spectral temperature @xmath110 kev obtained from the _ bepposax _ spectra , we measure @xmath111 that is not consistent at the 2.5 @xmath34 level with @xmath112 obtained from the modeling of the surface brightness profile with a spherically - symmetric and isothermal x - ray emission .    from the analysis of the _ bepposax _ data , we observe a gas temperature that is consistent with _",
    "asca _ measurements and significantly higher than the estimate obtained from _",
    "rosat _ and _ exosat_. we suspect that a calibration problem affects the measure done with _",
    "pspc and a misdirect pointing that done with _",
    "exosat_. here we note that also the main cluster in the shapley core , i.e. a3558 , presents a temperature of the intracluster plasma lower than the _ asca _ estimate ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 , hanami et al .",
    "1999 , white 2000 ) when it is measured with _",
    "rosat _ pspc ( bardelli et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we observe evidence of a gradient in the temperature and abundance profiles .",
    "the presence of the small cooling flow in the core of a3562 and the steep decrease of the metallicity in the southern and eastern sectors may suggest that the cluster is undergoing a successive merger with a group with a luminosity of about @xmath113 erg s@xmath11 and poor metallicity in the east , after a time in which the relaxation allowed the enhancement of the gas density in the core .",
    "it is worth to note that bardelli et al .",
    "( 1998b ) show the evidence of two merging groups in the same directions of the observed x - ray excess : the clump t598 has a peak density at 17.7 arcmin to east of the x - ray center , while t599 is separated by 28.9 arcmin from the x - ray center to the south - east . from the isodensity of the bi - dimensional distribution ( fig .",
    "9 of bardelli et al 1998b ) and the redshift distribution ( fig .  2 of bardelli et al 1998a ) of galaxies belonging to these groups , they appear quite dispersed , probably due to strong tidal interaction with the more massive a3562 .    from a recent survey performed at 20 cm in the region of the a3558 chain ( venturi et al .",
    "2000 ) , it results that a3562 hosts in its neighborhood nine of the 28 radio sources of the cluster complex .",
    "seven of these objects are located in the eastern edge , where the dynamical analysis found the existence of the two groups , t598 and t599 , cited above .",
    "these two groups seem to connect each other near the position of the x - ray excess we detected at a distance of @xmath114 arcmin from the a3562 center .",
    "two ( j1333 - 3141 and j1335 - 3153 ) of the a3562 radio sources present extended morphology and it was possible to estimate their physical properties .",
    "in particular , the equipartition pressure of j1333 - 3141 is @xmath115 dyne @xmath23 ( or @xmath116 k @xmath76 ) : if the source is at the projected distance of @xmath117 kpc , the pressure of the hot gas @xmath118 as estimated from the deprojection will be a factor 100 higher than @xmath119 .",
    "this is not a strange result , since it is known that the radio emission could be overpressured by the diffuse hot gas up to a factor 10 - 100 ( feretti , perola & fanti 1992 ) .",
    "however , if we impose @xmath120 , we derive a physical distance of @xmath121 mpc of the radio source from the cluster center , with an inclination of the tail of @xmath0 83with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "more interesting is the source j1335 - 3153 , whose pressure is @xmath122 dyne @xmath23 ; its projected distance from the cluster center is @xmath123 mpc . at this distance",
    ", the gas of a3562 is not able to confine the extended radio emission , which on the contrary could be in interaction with the more diffuse component seen in the x - ray map , if it extends to the radio source . a more detailed analysis ,",
    "comprising also the age of the relativistic electrons derived from the spectra , is underway .",
    "a _ bepposax _ observation of each of the two groups of galaxies present in the shapley core , sc1327 - 312 and sc1329 - 313 , is planned by the end of the present ao ( march 2000 ) .",
    "these observations will allow us to describe in detail the ongoing merging thanks to the capability of _ bepposax _ to map the temperature distribution as shown in the present work .",
    "this research has made use of linearized event files produced at the _ bepposax _ science data center and data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa - goddard space flight centre .",
