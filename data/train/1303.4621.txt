    "a hydrodynamically stable rotation law may become unstable under the presence of a sufficiently strong uniform axial field .",
    "for this so - called magnetorotational instability ( mri ) the axial field provides the catalyst which makes the rotation law unstable without any modification of the uniform field ( velikhov 1959 ) . of course , by this mechanism a protoplanetary disk with a keplerian rotation law should also become unstable if it is not too cold  or ( almost ) equivalently  if the field is strong enough . for an estimation of the critical magnetic field strength it is enough to use the condition @xmath6 , where the lundquist number @xmath7 with @xmath8 the amplitude of the axial field , @xmath9 the semi - thickness of the disk , and @xmath10 the microscopic magnetic diffusivity . plotted in the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane , with @xmath13 as the magnetic reynolds number , and for small magnetic prandtl number",
    "@xmath14 the viscosity hardly influences the instability map . at a distance of 1 au from a central mass with 1 @xmath15",
    "the disk thickness is about 3% , the density @xmath16 of the gas @xmath17 g/@xmath18 , and @xmath19 @xmath20/s ( because of the low temperature of the gas ) .",
    "hence , the surprisingly high value of 0.1 g is obtained for the minimum @xmath8 .    in order to excite nonaxisymmetric mri modes",
    "one needs even higher magnetic fields .",
    "kitchatinov & rdiger ( 2010 ) showed in a linear theory that nonaxisymmetric modes only arise if @xmath21 , with the alfvn frequency @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 at 1 au this condition is fulfilled for @xmath24 g. such strong fields at this distance can not be due to a stellar dipole field in the center . on the other hand , one should mention that the fossil magnetic fields found in meteorites are of just this order .",
    "one solution of this dilemma is to consider toroidal fields , which by the stretching action of differential rotation may often exceed the values of the poloidal field . for protoplanetary disks ,",
    "however , the magnetic reynolds number @xmath12 only reaches values of about 50 , so that the resulting toroidal field does _ not _ dominate the original @xmath8 .",
    "the same is true for galaxies when the interstellar turbulence is driven by sn - explosions .",
    "the resulting magnetic reynolds number is then also of order 10100 , so that the induced toroidal field does not dominate the poloidal one  as observed .",
    "a very different situation holds for the radiative cores of rotating stars . due to the high conductivity of the hot plasma",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is so large that even very slight differential rotation will produce toroidal fields which clearly dominate the fossil poloidal fields .",
    "it should then be sufficient to consider the stability of only the strong toroidal field under the presence of differential rotation . in the present paper",
    "we shall always apply a rotation law close to the profile of uniform specific angular momentum , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "this rather steep profile is just beyond the regime of hydrodynamic centrifugal instability , also in spherical systems ( see rdiger & kitchatinov 1996 ) .",
    "there are basic stability conditions in cylindrical geometry .",
    "a flow is stable against axisymmetric perturbations if @xmath26 ( michael 1954 ) .",
    "this condition turns into the well - known rayleigh criterion for both @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the latter case means that an axial uniform electric current does not suppress taylor vortices , which are due to too steep rotation profiles .",
    "hence , rotation laws which are steeper than @xmath1 will always excite axisymmetric rolls , even under the presence of very strong toroidal fields with @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
    "any unstable @xmath30-profiles can be stabilized with a toroidal field of sufficiently large amplitude and suitable geometry .",
    "if nonaxisymmetric modes are considered then the necessary and sufficient condition for stability becomes @xmath31 ( tayler 1957 , 1973 , vandakurov 1972 ) , at least in the absence of rotation . the fully general formulation including rotation is not known .",
    "two questions immediately arise : i ) is the field corresponding to a uniform current ( @xmath29 ) really unstable , and ii ) does the current - free field @xmath32 become unstable under the presence of ( differential ) rotation ? both questions can be answered . in the first case the resulting instability",
    "is called the tayler instability ( ti ) , and in the second case , where fields and rotation profiles that would each be stable on their own interact to yield instability , the result is called the azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri ) . whereas the energy for the ti comes from the electric current ,",
    "the energy source for amri is entirely from the differential rotation , and amri can only saturate at the expense of the rotational shear by producing high values of ` eddy ' viscosity .",
    "this could therefore justify the high values of ` artificial ' viscosity which eggenberger , montalbn & miglio ( 2012 ) introduced to explain the slow rotation of the stellar cores after the collapse towards their red giant stage .",
    "the interaction of flow and field has already been considered by chandrasekhar ( 1956 ) who proved that for ideal media the system @xmath33 and @xmath34 is _ stable _ for @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , the current - free ( amri ) field @xmath36 subject to the rotation with @xmath37 ( rayleigh limit ) belongs to this class .",
    "instability is thus only possible for @xmath38 with the alfvn frequency @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ f0 ] ( left ) as a result of numerical calculations indeed shows the realization of this finding for finite diffusivities .",
    "the lower branches for @xmath5 and @xmath40 are very close to that limit .",
    "for very small @xmath0 it is the upper branch which approaches the chandrasekhar line @xmath41 from below .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate the mechanism which leads to amri with a simple dispersion relation for the stability of _ nonaxisymmetric _ perturbations in the form @xmath43 with the real part @xmath44 as the growth rate .",
    "it is enough to apply the case with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( the rayleigh limit ) together with @xmath36 to the expressions given by kirillov , stefani & fukumoto ( 2012 ) for nonaxisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is of second order , i.e. @xmath47 here we have used the quantity @xmath48 as the growth rate in units of the angular velocity of rotation and the reynolds number @xmath49 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath50 describes an azimuthal drift @xmath51 of the nonaxisymmetric pattern ( see below ) .",
    "the coefficients in ( [ disp1 ] ) are @xmath52 with the abbreviations @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the formal solution of ( [ disp1 ] ) for marginal instability leads to the two conditions @xmath56 the first of these relations gives the negative drift rate in units of the basic rotation , i.e. @xmath57 the observable drift in the laboratory system , @xmath58 , is thus positive ( in the rotation direction ) and with @xmath59 .",
    "this value is reduced by medium hartmann numbers but it is independent of the magnetic field for large hartmann numbers . note the absence of the magnetic prandtl number in the relation ( [ disp4 ] ) . for small @xmath0 the drift values ( and also the axial wave numbers )",
    "do not depend on the actual values of @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "the phase speed @xmath60 is also independent of the sign of the mode number @xmath61 .",
    "the second condition in ( [ disp3 ] ) leads to @xmath62 the latter relation holding for strong fields .",
    "axisymmetric solutions do not exist .",
    "it is also clear that the mode with @xmath63 is most easily excited so that @xmath64 again valid for large @xmath65 .",
    "the influence of the axial wave number on the excitation condition is rather strong .",
    "solutions with large axial wave number  representing oblate cells  require much slower rotation to be excited than round cells .",
    "for the elsasser number @xmath66 one obtains @xmath67    where the influence of both the microscopic viscosity and the radial wave number completely disappear .",
    "note that the normalized wave number @xmath68 is of order unity for spheres or axially unbounded cylinders but is much larger for thin disks .",
    "another interesting reformulation of this relation is @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "it is thus clear that for large enough @xmath10 , i.e. for sufficiently low electric conductivity , the ratio ( [ disp7 ] ) may exceed unity , which is not the case for @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ f0 ] , left ) .",
    "hence , for small magnetic prandtl number amri exists in the strong - field limit ( @xmath71 ) while the opposite is true ( @xmath72 ) for @xmath73 .",
    "equation ( [ disp7 ] ) with @xmath74 and with the above given disk parameters leads to a critical magnetic field of @xmath75  g , the latter for a thin disk with @xmath76 .",
    "one needs about @xmath77  g poloidal field to induce toroidal fields with 100  g in such disks",
    ".    for the inner radiative zones of hot giants the relation ( [ disp7 ] ) turns into @xmath78 which with @xmath79 g/@xmath18 , @xmath80 @xmath20/s and @xmath81 s@xmath82 provides about 1 g as the threshold value of the toroidal field .",
    "with view on the experimental demonstration of amri we consider a taylor - couette set - up with two corotating cylinders of nearly perfectly conducting material .",
    "the cylinders confine an incompressible , conducting fluid under the presence of a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that the radial profiles of the rotating flow and the field between the cylinders are @xmath83 let the ratio of the rotation rates of the cylinders be @xmath84 and a similar expression for the field amplitudes , i.e. @xmath85 the ratio of the cylinder radii is @xmath86 , where we will fix @xmath87 .",

    "( [ uphi ] ) ) , while @xmath91 describes the quasi - galactic rotation law @xmath92 .",
    "these two rotation laws form the extremes which will be considered here in detail .",
    "as they behave rather differently the solutions for the rotation laws between them ( e.g. the kepler rotation law ) should be more complex and might even depend on the boundary conditions . as a special choice for a laboratory experiment also",
    "a rotation law with @xmath93 has been considered which is hydrodynamically stable but close enough to the rayleigh limit to become unstable with rather weak magnetic fields and slow basic rotation ( see below ) .",
    "the magnetic profile in ( [ uphi ] ) also contains two extrema . with @xmath94",
    "the toroidal field is due to a homogeneous current inside the fluid .",

    "<S> the interaction of differential rotation and toroidal fields that are current - free in the gap between two corotating axially unbounded cylinders is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that nonaxisymmetric perturbations are unstable if the rotation rate and alfvn frequency of the field are of the same order , almost independent of the magnetic prandtl number @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for the very steep rotation law @xmath1 ( the rayleigh limit ) and for small @xmath0 the threshold values of rotation and field for this azimuthal magnetorotational instability ( amri ) scale with the ordinary reynolds number and the hartmann number , resp . </S>",
    "<S> a laboratory experiment with liquid metals like sodium or gallium in a taylor - couette container has been designed on the basis of this finding . for fluids with more flat rotation laws </S>",
    "<S> the reynolds number and the hartmann number are no longer typical quantities for the instability .    for the weakly nonlinear system the numerical values of the kinetic energy and the magnetic energy </S>",
    "<S> are derived for magnetic prandtl numbers @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetic energy grows monotonically with the magnetic reynolds number @xmath3 , while the kinetic energy grows with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting turbulent schmidt number , as the ratio of the ` eddy ' viscosity and the diffusion coefficient of a passive scalar ( such as lithium ) is of order 20 for @xmath5 , but for small @xmath0 it drops to order unity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in a stellar core with fossil fields and steep rotation law the transport of angular momentum by amri is always accompanied by an intense mixing of the plasma , until the rotation becomes rigid .    </S>",
