    "we will discuss similarities and differences to the edge - emitting case and to what extend vbg are helpful to control spatial modes in a vcsel .",

    "a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the vcsel used for this experiment is fabricated by ulm photonics and similar to the ones described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "it is a large aperture device , allowing for the formation of many transverse cavity modes of fairly high order , with a @xmath0 diameter circular oxide aperture providing optical and current guiding .",
    "the emission takes place through the n - doped bragg reflector and through a transparent substrate ( so - called bottom - emitter , @xcite ) .",
    "the laser has an emission wavelength around @xmath1 at room temperature .",
    "the vcsel is tuned in temperature up to @xmath2 so the emission wavelength approaches the reflection peak of the volume bragg grating ( vbg ) .",
    "the vbg has a reflection peak at @xmath3 with a reflection bandwidth of @xmath4 full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "at such a high temperature the free running laser nearly has an infinite threshold and lasing only occurs because of the feedback from the vbg .",
    "the vcsel is coupled to the vbg via a self - imaging external cavity .",
    "every point of the vcsel is imaged at the same spatial position after each round trip therefore maintaining the high fresnel number of the vcsel cavity .",
    "the vcsel is collimated by @xmath5 focal length plano - convex aspheric lens .",
    "the second lens is a @xmath6 focal length plano - convex lens and is used to focus the light onto the vbg .",
    "this telescope setup gives a @xmath7 magnification factor onto the vbg .",
    "this cavity has a round trip frequency of @xmath8 which corresponds to a round trip time of @xmath9 .",
    "the light is coupled out of the cavity using a glass plate ( beam splitter with a front uncoated facet and a back anti reflection coated facet ) .",
    "the reflection is relying on fresnel reflection and therefore is polarization dependent .",
    "the reflectivity is on the order of @xmath10 for s - polarized light and @xmath11 for p - polarized light .",
    "an optical isolator is used to prevent reflection from the detection to pass into the external cavity .",
    "there are two charge - coupled - device ( ccd ) cameras used for detection , one is used to produce images of the vcsel gain region ( near field ) and the other camera produces images of the fourier plane of the gain region ( far field ) .",
    "the emission spectrum is recorded with an optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) .",
    "there is also a photodiode which measures the laser power .",
    "the spontaneous emission is rather homogeneous below threshold ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vcsel]a ) but as the current increases the intensity becomes higher at the boundaries due to current crowding at the oxide aperture @xcite . in spite of the large aperture the device is still capable of lasing at low enough temperatures .",
    "the lower the temperature the lower the current required to achieve lasing . above threshold",
    "the laser starts to lase on a kind of whispering gallery mode ( e.g.  @xcite ) around the boundaries of the vcsel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vcsel]b ) .",
    "the gain is the highest due to the current crowding previously observed therefore leading to a lower threshold of this mode .",
    "as indicated , the cavity consists of two lenses forming an astronomical telescope .",
    "thus the magnification factor m of this telescope is determined by the ratio of the two focal lengths .",

    "this positive feedback can create an abrupt transition to lasing @xcite and can explain also the variation in wavelengths in the range below 420  ma in fig .",

    "by these investigations , the effect of the vbg on wavelength locking is quite clear but the influence of the distances between the intra - cavity lenses ( e.g.  @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) remains to be investigated .",
    "for example , figs .",
    "[ fig : nearfield ] and [ fig : farfield ] clearly indicate that @xmath17 has an influence on the spatial structures .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , a self imaging cavity is characterized by three distances .",
    "the first one is the distance @xmath66 between the laser and the collimation lens .",
    "it is found by adjusting the position of the lens until the divergence of the beam is minimal .",
    "the second distance @xmath64 is the distance separating both lenses also referred as the intra - cavity distance in the following ; ideally it is @xmath67 .",
    "the last distance is the distance @xmath65 separating the second lens and the vbg .",
    "it is determined by moving the vbg until the near field image of the vcsel has the sharpest boundaries .",
    "as indicated , matrix theory indicates that @xmath13 is not influencing the imaging condition for the intensity distribution . since @xmath13 is hence the most poorly defined one ( in the sense that there is no obvious alignment criterion like for @xmath66 , @xmath65 ) we first turn our attention to it .",
    "[ fig : transverse]b shows a dispersion relation similar to the one in a ) but obtained at @xmath68  mm , away from the self - imaging condition .",
    "though the data still seem to follow roughly a square - law like behavior , they are more scattered and the lower quality of the fit is evidenced also by reduction of the regression coefficient to @xmath69 and the parameter error returned is @xmath70 .",
    "the scaling exponent turns out to be slightly different from 0.5 , e.g.  0.479 in fig .",
    "[ fig : transverse]b .",
    "this scattered behavior combined with a reduction of the fitting quality and a deviation of the scaling exponent from 0.5 is typical also for other distances @xmath64 different from @xmath71  mm .",
    "for example , for @xmath72  mm , the scaling exponent is 0.508 and @xmath73 .",
    "we also notice that there is an enhanced tendency for slight variations of the details of the patterns ( not the basic structure ) from run to run away from @xmath71  mm .",
    "hence we report results averaged over three runs in tab .  [",
    "table : scaling_exp ] , which summarizes the effect of the intra cavity distance on the scaling exponent over a larger range .",
    "[ fig : qd2 ] illustrates the same results graphically .",
    "the first observation is that in general the averaged scaling exponent is oscillating around 0.5 with a tendency to larger values for smaller distances , but that there are actually two positions at @xmath74  mm in addition to @xmath71  mm at which the averaged scaling exponent is again close to 0.500 .",
    "however , as stated already above , the quality of the fits is lower and there is a larger variation between runs which we characterize by the standard deviation @xmath75 of the scaling exponents returned for the different runs ( tab .",
    "[ table : scaling_exp ] , last row ) . in order to get further insight in the nature of these deviations and variations , we analyzed the width of the ring in fourier space as a measure of the quality of wavenumber selection ( tab .",
    "[ table : scaling_exp ] , 2nd row and fig .",
    "[ fig : qd2 ] , dashed line ) .",
    "it has a minimum around @xmath71  mm , i.e.  the anticipated self - imaging condition , and increases , except for one exception interpreted as scatter , monotonically away from it .",
    "in particular , at 70.5  mm the ring is narrower than at both 74 mm and 78 mm ( see also the width in tab .  [",
    "table : scaling_exp ] ) .",

    "blue dashed line : thickness of the ring in far field vs.  @xmath13 . ]",
    "this behavior can be understood by the abcd - matrix for the round - trip through the external cavity if @xmath76 , which reads @xmath77 a small mistuning @xmath78 leads to a change of phase curvature or ray angle for the returning light .",
    "hence the spatial fourier spectrum broadens .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath64=70.5  mm corresponds to the self - imaging distance .",
    "it is also within @xmath79  mm of the best estimate we can give on the expected cavity length from the dispersion data and the knowledge of the principal planes available for the lenses used .    in order to confirm that",
    ", another experiment has been set up to study the cavity in details .",
    "it consists of the same telescope with the exact same optics ( a collimation lens , a focusing lens and a beam splitter ) .",
    "a tunable laser is coupled into a single mode fibre . the collimated output beam is then injected into the telescope from the side with the larger focal length lens",
    ". one should expect that the beam coming out of the telescope at the collimation lens has the smallest beam divergence if the intra - cavity distance is right and indeed best collimation is found within @xmath79  mm of @xmath64=70.5  mm , which is considered to be the accuracy of the distance measurement .    finally , we discuss the influence of @xmath65 on the pattern formation . fig .",
    "[ fig : posvbg ] indicates that it also has an influence on the scaling exponent as well as on the manifestation of structures .",
    "we noticed also in fig .",
    "[ fig : nearfield ] that for a too long cavity the near field seems to be pushed to the perimeter , whereas for a short cavity it seems to contract inwards .",
    "the boundaries are not as sharp and well defined .",
    "again these features can be understood by abcd - matrix theory , which gives for @xmath80 a round trip matrix of @xmath81 i.e.  the system is not imaging any more . for a ray emitted at a radius @xmath82 at an angle @xmath83 , the returning rays hits at @xmath84 this means that for @xmath85 ( too long cavity ) , the emission is pushed outwards , whereas for @xmath86 ( too short cavity ) it is pushed inward .",
    "this is the tendency observed in the experiment .",
    "note that the angle @xmath83 does not change very much .    .",
    "the 0 position indicates self imaging position and negative sign means that the vbg is moved towards the telescope .",
    "inversely , the positive sign means that the vbg is moved away from the focusing lens . ]",
    "we established that vbgs work as wavelength lockers for vcsels as well as for eel lasers for which they are of significant importance for wavelength and modal control .",
    "vcsels have already a lower temperature dependence than eel because their wavelength shift is determined by the cavity shift of about 0.1  nm / k ( gaas based devices ) compared to the gain shift of 0.2 - 0.3  nm / k relevant to eel .",
    "nevertheless , an external vbg can decrease this shift even more and the fidelity increases with increasing magnification of the imaging system , unfortunately increasing the foot print of the system .    for increasing temperature or current ,",
    "the on - axis modes come into resonance first and here phase - amplitude coupling leads to the possibility of bistability @xcite and , via self - focusing , soliton formation @xcite . beyond threshold",
    ", we can stabilize single - wavenumber and narrow bandwidth emission with fairly high fidelity .",
    "these structures might find applications where ring - shaped foci are desired .",
    "the radius of the ring can be tuned by current ( or temperature ) .",
    "this feature constitutes an important difference between vcsels and eel and stems from the fact that vcsels are intrinsically single - longitudinal mode devices .",
    "hence the wavelength locking is accompanied by an increase in mode order ( transverse wavenumber ) for increasing temperature ( induced either directly via the ambient temperature or via joule heating ) .",
    "in contrast , for an eel consequent longitudinal orders will shift into resonance and hence the modal distribution will contain the mixture of low - order and high - order modes typical for broad - area eel , but the average mode order wo nt be increasing so much as in the vcsel .",
    "we also analyzed the effect of deviations of the external cavity from the self - imaging condition .",
    "it turns out that the system is remarkably insensitive to deviations even in the mm range for a cavity length in the 100  mm range .",
    "this is good news for the robustness of experimental conditions .",
    "we remark that we consider the self - imaging condition to be attractive for these kind of experiments because it allows for best feedback efficiency in terms of amplitude and phase .",
    "an autocollimation setup using only the collimation lens ( as in @xcite ) not only introduces an image inversion ( relevant for gauss - hermite modes for example ) , but due to the shortness of the focal lengths of typical collimation lenses , it is also likely that the length of the external cavity is larger than the perfect telescope length ( an imperfect @xmath13 in our terminology ) . hence , there is a phase curvature of the returning beam for gaussian modes and a chance of ray direction for fourier modes and as a result an imperfect interference with the cavity mode .",
    "deviations from the self - imaging conditions make it also more difficult to model the returning field distribution , though in principle methods like the collins - integral are available , of course @xcite .",
