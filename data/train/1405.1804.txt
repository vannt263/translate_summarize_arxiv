    "one of the inflation models , which agrees with the bicep2 results , is the well - known natural inflation @xcite .",
    "the motivation of natural inflation @xcite is to solve the flatness problem of inflation potential at tree level , and remains flat against radiative corrections .",
    "the continuous shift symmetry protects the flatness of inflation potential . to realize inflation ,",
    "the continuous symmetry should be broken to a discrete shift symmetry @xmath4 with @xmath5 the axion ( or inflaton ) decay constant , and the potential for natural inflation is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inflation energy scale around @xmath8 gev or @xmath9 for @xmath10 with @xmath11 the reduced planck mass ( @xmath12 gev ) .",
    "axion is a  natural \" inflaton candidate since it preserves the exact continuous shift symmetry at perturbative level .",
    "axions can be obtained from antisymmetric tensor fields in string theory through spacetime compactification @xcite .",
    "considering the non - perturbative effects , such as gaugino condensation or instanton effect , one can break such continuous shift symmetry of axion to the discrete symmetry and then realize natural inflation in string theory .",
    "the challenge to natural inflation is the large decay constant @xmath5 . to generate sufficient large tensor fluctuations that are consistent with bicep2 observations ,",
    "the decay constant @xmath5 should be trans - planckian @xmath13 in the planck units @xcite .",
    "however , in string theory the axion decay constant can not be larger than the string scale @xmath14 @xcite , which is about one order below the reduced planck scale as required by the weak interaction assumption .",
    "an effective large axion decay constant was realized by the n - flation  @xcite or the aligned axion mechanism @xcite . in the aligned natural inflation  @xcite ,",
    "two axions with small decay constants are carefully adjusted to form a flat direction for inflation , and then one - linear combination of two axions can have the effective trans - planckian decay constant . recently",
    ", there are many works proposed to realize large decay constant with multi - aligned axions @xcite or realize n - flation and natural inflation in string theory  @xcite .    to obtain inflation in string theory or its low energy approximation ",
    "supergravity ( sugra ) , there is a general problem on the moduli stabilization . for single field inflation , all the scalars except the inflaton",
    "should be fixed during inflation . the well - known kklt mechanism based on f - term",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where the complex - structure moduli are stabilized by the fluxes @xcite while the khler modulus is stabilized through the non - perturbative effects .",
    "the difficulty to realize axion inflation based on the kklt mechanism is : once the real component of the khler modulus is fixed , its axionic component obtains large mass as well and then destroys inflation @xcite .",
    "this problem can be solved by considering the modulus - dependent fi term associated with anomalous @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fi term only depends on the real component of modulus , which can obtain large mass from d - term flatness .",
    "the axion is still light as it decouples from d - term .    in this work ,",
    "we construct a natural inflation model in string - inspired sugra where only one modulus couples to the matter fields .",
    "the shift symmetry of axion is gauged to obtain anomalous @xmath0 .",
    "the gauge invariant superpotential consists of the non - perturbative term of modulus and various couplings among matter fields .",
    "all the matter fields are stabilized by f - terms , and the vanishing d - term gives large mass to the real component of the modulus .",
    "the axion is still light after modulus stabilization and its potential is given exactly by eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) . besides , the trans - planckian axion decay constant can be obtained naturally by taking the large condensation gauge group and numbers of @xmath0 charged matter fields ( around 20 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide the string - inspired sugra structure for model building and show the anomaly cancellation of @xmath0 . in section 3 the matter fields / modulus stabilizations based on the f - terms / d - term are discussed . in section 4",
    "we obtain the natural inflation potential after stabilizations , and the trans - planckian axion decay constant is realized from the non - perturbative effects with suitable condensation gauge group .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we consider the following khler potential @xmath15 in which the indexes are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the modulus @xmath20 can be dilaton superfield or one of the khler moduli from string compactification .",
    "the @xmath0 charged matter fields @xmath21 , which will be generically denoted as @xmath22 , are introduced to construct gauge invariant superpotential and cancel the gauge anomalies .",
    "the modulus @xmath20 and matter fields @xmath22 transform under @xmath0 as follows @xmath23 in which the @xmath0 charges @xmath24 are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 are neutral under @xmath0 and vanish during inflation , their f - terms are used to stabilize @xmath29 and @xmath30 with non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vev ) .",
    "the superpotential is @xmath31 given @xmath32 , above superpotential is obviously @xmath0 invariant .",
    "the first two terms in ( [ sp ] ) is similar with the kklt scenario in a gauge invariant form @xcite .",
    "the constant term @xmath33 is from the complex - structure moduli stabilization .",
    "different from the kklt scenario , the non - perturbative term @xmath34 is @xmath0 invariant .",
    "the @xmath0 transformation of matter field @xmath35 cancels the phase factor @xmath36 from shift of the modulus @xmath37 under @xmath0 .",
    "such kind of non - perturbative superpotential can be obtained from the gaugino condensation with massive chiral superfields , which form representation of the condensation group , such as @xmath38 and can be integrated out in effective field theory .",
    "the effective superpotential is guaranteed to be @xmath0 invariant @xcite .",
    "effects of the gauge invariant non - perturbative term on moduli stabilization and inflation have been studied in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this form the matter field @xmath39 has positive exponent , and gives an analytic coefficient for the non - perturbative term , which makes the anomalous @xmath0 d - term cancellable .",
    "the d - term flatness is needed for modulus stabilization .    in eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) , we will have many other superpotential terms , for example , @xmath40 , etc , which are allowed by the @xmath0 symmetry but neglected . to solve this problem",
    ", we can introduce a @xmath41 discrete symmetry under which @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 transform as follows @xmath46 with @xmath47 , while all the other fields are neutral under @xmath48 .",

    "the anomalous @xmath0 plays a special role in the quantum anomaly cancellation through the green - schwarz mechanism in four dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "the gauge kinetic term of @xmath0 is @xmath54 in which @xmath55 is @xmath0 gauge field strength . here",
    "we take the gauge kinetic function @xmath56 .",
    "the gauge kinetic term contains two parts @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the first term is @xmath0 invariant , while the second term transforms non - trivially under @xmath0 .",
    "the shift of modulus @xmath20 introduces an extra term @xmath59 , which cancels the anomaly from charged fermionic fields and keep the theory anomaly free .    ignoring the anomaly of condensation gauge group @xmath38 , we need to consider two kinds of anomalies : the gravitational anomaly @xmath0 and the cubic anomaly @xmath60 .",
    "the fermionic contributions are : @xmath61 the gravitational anomaly is canceled without higher derivative terms @xmath62 .",
    "anomaly cancelation of cubic term @xmath60 requires @xmath63 as @xmath32 , we have @xmath64 .",
    "in this model , the matter fields are stabilized by f - terms . even though there is the kklt type superpotential in ( [ sp ] )",
    ", it has nothing to do with modulus stabilization but provides potential for natural inflation , actually , the real component of the modulus is stabilized by @xmath0 d - term .",
    "the f - term scalar potential is given by @xmath65 in which @xmath66 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the complete expression of @xmath69 is rather tedious , nevertheless , it can be remarkably simplified after field stabilization .      for matter fields stabilization",
    ", we ignore the constant term and the non - perturbative term , as they provide inflationary potential which is significantly lower than the matter fields stabilization scale .",
    "their effects will be estimated later .",
    "clearly the matter fields @xmath70 and @xmath28 have global minimum at origin while extra matter fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 will get non - trivial vevs . during inflation",

    "there are numerous corrections containing @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ( [ vf1 ] , [ vf2 ] , [ vf3 ] , [ vf4 ] ) , however , they are either significantly smaller than ( [ vf ] ) or can be canceled with each other .",

    "the quasi - cosmology constant provided by inflaton is @xmath118 in the planck units , @xmath113 is of order @xmath119 in our model , therefore the shift of matter fields is about @xmath120 .",

    "they obtain masses several orders larger than the mass of inflaton , consequently the effect of vacuum energy from inflaton on field stabilization is seriously suppressed and ignorable .",
    "the modulus - dependent fi term of @xmath0 plays a critical role in modulus stabilization .",
    "as the coupling between matter field and modulus is analytic , the d - term can be vanished in our model .",
    "once the matter fields obtain non - zero vevs , the real component of modulus @xmath20 is fixed by the d - term flatness . while the d - term is independent with the axionic component of @xmath20 ,",
    "therefore its cancellation has no effect on axion which remains light after modulus stabilization .",

    "moduli stabilization , usually the imaginary component of modulus obtains mass as large as the real component @xcite , the axion inflation can not be realized .",
    "the reason is in f - term potential , the real and imaginary components of moduli couple with each other , it is highly non - trivial to split their masses at different scale so that one of them can play the role of inflaton while the other is frozen during inflation .",
    "potential for natural inflation is obtained from non - perturbative effect .",
    "generally it is very difficult to get trans - planckian axion decay constant , which is needed to fit with bicep2 results . in our model ,",
    "the axion decay constant linearly depends on the degree of condensation gauge group @xmath38 and number of @xmath0 charged matter fields , therefore , the super - planckian axion decay constant can be easily fulfilled by using large condensation gauge group and more @xmath0 charged fields .",
