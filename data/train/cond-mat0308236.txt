    "figure 10 summaries the outcome of such experiment on bt-2 using the @xmath103 crystal of superconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 in two different field geometries .",
    "we first describe measurements in the @xmath48 zone , where the applied vertical field is along the @xmath49 $ ] direction of nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 and @xmath99 $ ] direction of ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 . in this geometry",
    ", we can probe the field - induced effect on @xmath63 and @xmath104 without much affecting the superconductivity .",
    "while scattering at @xmath63 may originate from either nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 or ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 , @xmath104 is exclusively associated with the @xmath105 reflection of ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 ( table ii ) . figures 10a and b show the outcome of the experiment along the @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 $ ] directions at 5 k. clear field - induced effects are seen at @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "10b ) , indicating that ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 can indeed be polarized by the applied field .",
    "similar measurements on @xmath104 with field aligned along the @xmath49 $ ] direction of ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 show a weaker field - induced effect , thus suggesting that its easy axis is along the @xmath99 $ ] direction .",
    "if we ignore the contribution of the superlattice structure to @xmath63 and assume that the scattering there is due entirely to ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 ( table ii ) , its integrated intensity should be identical to that at @xmath104 because of the cubic symmetry of ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 . by normalizing the zero field intensity at @xmath104 to that at @xmath63",
    ", we can compare the field - induced effect at these two equivalent positions for ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 . since the field - induced effect at @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "10a ) is only about 25% larger that at @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "10b ) , we conclude that the field - induced intensity at @xmath63 is mostly due to the polarization of ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 in this field geometry .",
    "ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 at @xmath63 and @xmath104 in the @xmath30-plane geometry with that at @xmath63 and @xmath108 in the @xmath19-axis geometry .",
    "scans through ( a ) @xmath63 and ( b ) @xmath104 at 5 k for field along the @xmath49 $ ] axis . since @xmath104 from ( nd",
    ", ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 is very close to the strong @xmath105 nuclear bragg peak from nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 , the radial scan in the inset of ( b ) shows sloped background .",
    "we determine the background scattering at @xmath104 by fitting a gaussian with fixed width to @xmath105 ( dashed line in the inset ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the transverse scan across @xmath104 .",
    "similar scans through ( c ) @xmath63 and ( d ) @xmath108 for field along the @xmath101 $ ] direction .",
    "the ratios of integrated intensities of @xmath104 and @xmath63 between 6.9 t and 0 t ( @xmath109(6.9 t)@xmath110(0 t ) ) are 2.7 and 3.3 , respectively , for the @xmath30-plane field . in comparison ,",
    "the ratio is 5.7 for both @xmath63 and @xmath108 for the @xmath0-axis aligned field . in ref . @xcite and fig .",
    "6 , the ratios of @xmath109(7 t)@xmath110(0 t ) at @xmath63 are 6.8 and 5.5 , respectively , in the @xmath19-axis geometry . ]    in figures 10c and d , we plot the field - induced effect for the @xmath19-axis experiment at two equivalent reflections @xmath63 and @xmath108 . while the magnitude of field - induced effect is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite , they are twice as large as that of figs . 10a and b. since the cubic symmetry of ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 requires the same induced effect for fields along @xmath99 $ ] and @xmath100 $ ] , the observation of a much larger field - induced effect in @xmath19-axis geometry means the excess field - induced intensity must originate from the suppression of superconductivity .",
    "finally , we remark that one concern raised @xcite was that the finite @xmath51 behavior we observe might not be intrinsic to superconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 , but rather it is somehow induced by the magnetic coupling to the ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 impurity phase . however , ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 has a very weak exchange interaction and thus orders at very low temperature .",
    "it is difficult to see how ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 could dominate the nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 physics , particularly when it only constitutes a small ( @xmath1110@xmath111 ) volume fraction of the crystals in superconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the nd magnetic structure in nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 has the same symmetry as the cu spin configuration and thus is maximally coupled to the cu spins @xcite . even in this case",
    ", the perturbation of the nd order parameter by the cu spins is small .",
    "therefore , while the ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 ordering may be induced by being in contact with bulk nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 , it is highly improbable that the field - induced magnetic scattering at @xmath93 could be induced by the ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 impurity .",
    "we have investigated the effect of a @xmath19-axis field in all phases of nd@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and in as - grown nonsuperconducting and superconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 . at zero - field ,",
    "cu spins in nd@xmath1cuo@xmath2 form noncollinear structures because of the coupling between cu@xmath10 and nd@xmath12 .",
    "such a magnetic interaction also creates a small in - plane spin - wave gap @xmath112 at @xmath113 . for a magnetic field",
    "aligned parallel to the cuo@xmath5 plane , cu spins transform from a noncollinear to collinear structure in a spin - flop phase transition with a critical field less than 2-t @xcite .",
    "such a spin - flop transition occurs because when the magnetic field associated with the zeeman energy ( @xmath114 ) equals to @xmath112 , the net magnetic exchange interaction vanishes and with it the noncollinear spin structure @xcite .    for a 7-t @xmath19-axis field ,",
    "our data clearly indicate that the noncollinear af spin structures in nd@xmath1cuo@xmath2 are essentially unaffected for temperatures above 5 k. as a consequence , the zero - field in - plane spin - wave gap @xmath112 and the magnetic exchange interaction must also remain unchanged in the field .",
    "the large increase in the cu(nd ) fm moments suggests that the applied @xmath0-axis field only induces a canting of the af order .",
    "these results contrast significantly with that of superconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 , where the applied field induces a static , long - range ordered af state @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the annealing process necessary for superconductivity in nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 also induces structural superlattice reflections at @xmath63 and @xmath83 positions .",
    "in addition , we confirm the presence of the cubic ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 as an impurity phase in superconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 following the annealing process @xcite .",
    "although the lattice parameter of the cubic ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 is very close to the in - plane lattice parameter of nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 , most of the structural superlattice reflections in the @xmath47 plane are quasi two - dimensional and can not be associated with the three - dimensional cubic ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 . by probing the @xmath51-dependence of the scattering with a @xmath0-axis aligned field ,",
    "we show that the residual af order in superconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 enhances with increasing field .",
    "such behavior is different from the field effect on as - grown nonsuperconducting nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 , where the long - range noncollinear af order is essentially unaffected by a 7-t @xmath0-axis aligned field . by studying the anisotropy of field - induced effect ,",
    "we determine the effect of the magnetic field on the cubic ( nd , ce)@xmath5o@xmath6 and confirm that the results with the @xmath0-axis field in the @xmath46 $ ] plane are inconsistent with the impurity phase . combining these results with horizontal field experiments , we conclude that af order is induced in nd@xmath3ce@xmath4cuo@xmath8 upon suppression of superconductivity by a @xmath0-axis aligned magnetic field .",
