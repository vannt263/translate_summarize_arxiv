    "about 50% of well - localized grbs show optical transients ( ots ) successive to the prompt gamma - ray emission , whereas an x - ray counterpart is present in 90% of cases .",
    "it is possible that late and shallow observations could not detect the ots in some cases ; several authors argue that dim and/or rapid decaying transients could bias the determination of the fraction of truly obscure grbs @xcite . however , recent reanalysis of optical observations @xcite has shown that grbs without ot detection ( usually dark grbs , foas failed optical afterglows , or ghosts , gamma ray burst hiding an optical source transient ) have had on average weaker optical counterparts , at least 2 magnitudes in the r band , than grbs with ots . therefore , they appear to constitute a different class of objects , albeit there could be a fraction undetected for bad imaging .",
    "two hypothesis have been put forward to explain the behaviour of ghosts .",
    "first , they are similar to the other bright grbs , except for the fact that their lines of sight pass through large and dusty molecular clouds , that cause high absorption .",
    "second , they are more distant than grbs with ot , at @xmath3 @xcite , so that the lyman break is redshifted into the optical band . these grbs might be associated with the explosion of ancient population iii , high mass stars .",
    "nevertheless , the distances of a few dark grbs have been determined and they do not imply high redshifts @xcite    goal of this paper is an analysis of a complete sample of bepposax x - ray afterglows in order to distinguish between these various scenarios , including all x - ray fast observation from the launch to february 2001 . in  2 and  3 we present the data analysis of the afterglows and we show the results , whose implications are discussed in  4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "we have analyzed all the 31 fast bepposax observations of grb x - ray afterglows taken by the low energy ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) and medium energy ( 1.6 - 10 kev ) concentrator spectrometer ( lecs and mecs respectively , see parmar et al .",

    "x - ray follow up observations usually start @xmath4 hours after the high energy event and the typical observation time is @xmath5 seconds for mecs and @xmath6 for lecs . the exposure - or integration - lasts @xmath7 of the observation .    in order to find out the grb x - ray afterglows ,",
    "we first have built up the images of each grb with the mecs and selected sources with @xmath8 significance within the wfc error box .",
    "successively , we have built the light curves of these sources to recognize afterglows through their typical fading emission .",
    "the counts have been collected within a circle centered on source with radius @xmath9 arcmin .",
    "then we have subtracted the background collected in annuli around the extraction area and 5 times more extended .",
    "local background have been used in order to take into account possible time fluctuations .",
    "toos successive to the first one ( typically @xmath10 day after ) have been used , if available .",
    "we have fitted the light curves with simple power law @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is counts per second ) and 26 sources with decaying index @xmath13 ( at @xmath14 confidence level ) have been recognized as grb afterglows . in the case of grb970111 , grb991106 and grb000615 we have detected 1 source within wfc error box that does not show a significant fading behaviour",
    ". we will refer to them as `` candidate '' afterglows .",
    "we have calculated the probability to have serendipitous sources with their flux within the wfc error box , adopting the log n - log s distribution for bepposax released by @xcite .",
    "the probability is @xmath15 for each one , while the probability that all of them are not afterglows is @xmath16 .",
    "the mecs integration time for grb990907 was only 1070 seconds , so that the presence of a fading flux could not be verified .",
    "the x - ray source detected was recognized as the grb afterglow because the probability to have a serendipitous source with flux @xmath17 erg @xmath18 sec@xmath19 ( see further ) in the wfc error box was @xmath20 .",
    "finally , in the case of grb990217 and grb010220 , we have not detected any source with @xmath21 significance .",
    "to obtain flux , we have produced spectra for the afterglows from lecs and mecs first too data . for absorption and spectral index ,",
    "we have selected those with more than 150 photons in the mecs ( background subtracted ) . 5 ghosts and",
    "9 otgrbs passed this criterion .",
    "we have generally taken the lecs data between 0.1 and 4.0 kev and the mecs data between 1.6 and 10 kev .",
    "the backgrounds we have used are the library ones because they have a very good signal - to - noise ratio , due to long exposition .",
    "however , we have taken the minimum energy for lecs to be 0.4 kev if the galactic column density was @xmath22 @xmath18 because in this case the low energy backgrounds differ from the library ones , which have been taken at high galactic latitudes and lower column densities @xcite .",
    "if we had not adopted this criterion , our analysis would have led to overestimate the true absorption at the source .",
    "the standard spectrum model to fit the data consists of a constant , galactic absorption , extragalactic absorption ( i.e. _ in situ _ ) and a power law .",
    "the constant has been included because lecs and mecs observe a decaying source at different times .",
    "its value is allowed to vary within a range , obtained in each case by fitting lecs and mecs data in the 1.6 - 4 kev interval ( to avoid absorption effects ) with a simple power law model .",
    "the redshift in our fits has been forced to be 1 for all bursts .",
    "this value corresponds roughly to the average redshift of otgrbs .",
    "we have adopted this `` working hypothesis '' to obtain a homogeneous set that allows us to compare the absorption properties of dark grbs in the assumption that they are at the same distance .",
    "we have calculated the 1.6 - 10 kev flux of dark and bright grbs 11 hours after the burst trigger .",
    "we have chosen this time to avoid effects of changes in decaying slope .",
    "the average count rate in the mecs has been associated with the flux given by the spectrum .",
    "successively , we have taken the count rate at 11 hours , which is given by light curves , to compute the flux at that time . in most cases ,",
    "observations include it . in a few cases ( e.g. grb000926 ) the flux has been extrapolated .    for grb990907 ,",
    "the counts collected were very few and we have not been able to do any spectral analysis .",
    "we have estimated the flux assuming a spectral index @xmath23 .",

    "upper limits have been included as true afterglows as well as candidate afterglows .    as a first assessment of our study , we can say that x - ray afterglows follow the prompt gamma emission in 26 of 31 cases , which constitute 84% of the sample .",

    "we have calculated its x - ray flux but this burst has not been included in our successive analysis .",

    "we can immediately recognize that @xmath86 of the ghosts of our sample ( 14 of 19 ) have optical flux upper limits consistent with ot detections ( see fig .",

    "this result gives support to the fact that they could be faint sources with optical properties assimilable to x - ray ones .",
    "the remaining 5 objects , which constitute @xmath87 of ghosts , have optical flux upper limits lower than all otgrbs in our set ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . furthermore , their optical emission must have been even 2 - 3 times fainter than the dim afterglow of grb000630 and 4 - 6 fainter than grb020124 @xcite , which had an r band flux @xmath88 jy and @xmath89 jy respectively .",
    "these two optical afterglows , however , are not the weakest ever occurred . in our set ,",
    "the ot of grb980613 is even dimmer ( see table 1 ) and establishes a more stringent test .",
    "we wonder if the hypothesis of weaker flux at all wavelenghts can hold for these 5 ghosts ( hereafter , we will refer to them as `` the darkest '' or the `` most obscure '' , etc . for simplicity ) .",
    "if so , we would expect that their x - ray fluxes were proportionally very weak like the optical fluxes , so that their @xmath63 s should be not very different from otgrbs . in 4 cases of 5",
    "the @xmath63 s are lower than all otgrbs and @xmath90 times lower than the average optical - to - x flux ratio of otgrbs .",
    "the exception is grb990217 , which has upper limits both in optical and in x - rays flux .",
    "if we use both of them , then we get log @xmath91 which is much more similar to @xmath47 log @xmath67 @xmath54 .",
    "we have performed a k - s test on @xmath63 between all these darkest bursts and all otgrbs .",

    "therefore , we have a strong indication that for these bursts the spectrum is depleted in the optical band , by @xmath95 magnitude on average .",
    "the x - ray mean flux of these 5 ghosts is @xmath96 .",
    "the logarithmic ratio between the otgrb x - ray flux mean and this mean is log @xmath97 , which corresponds to a 4.3 factor .",
    "a hypothesis for the absence of ot and fainter x - ray flux is that of very high redshift .",
    "the grb prompt emission and x - ray afterglow of the strongest bursts ( e.g. grb990123 and grb990510 ) could be detectable even they occur at @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "however , if ghosts were at @xmath99 , then extragalactic hydrogen clouds would entirely wash out optical emission @xcite .    to estimate the average redshift of the most obscure grbs",
    ", we shall use the formula @xcite :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the spectral index , @xmath102 is the decaying ( temporal ) index and @xmath103 is the comoving distance .",
    "we assume the cosmological parameters values @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "the average of the known redshifts of otgrbs in our set is @xmath107 .    in the simplest model of grb afterglows , @xmath108",
    ", so @xmath109 .",
    "for such parameters , the average redshift of the darkest grbs should be @xmath110 under the assumption that the lower mean flux were only due to their larger distances and not to an intrinsic difference in their luminosity .",
    "using the best estimate of @xmath111 calculated for otgrbs and the average @xmath112 of the strongest bursts of our sample , we obtain @xmath113 .",
    "we should also expect a distribution of burst redshifts around @xmath114 .",
    "these facts make the high redshift scenario for the most obscure ghosts still plausible .",
    "adopting the hypothesis grbs are the final result of very massive star evolution , an interesting issue to address is what might be the progenitors of grbs at very high redshifts .",
    "currently , we observe only old and low - mass population ii stars , but even high mass stars could have formed .",
    "theories suggest that the first stars of the universe - the so - called population iii - might have very large mass , so they could possibly be good candidates .",
    "recent calculations suggest @xcite that the star formation rate has two peaks .",
    "the first one , at @xmath115 is due to population iii stars .",
    "the second one , due to population ii , is higher and much broader and it is at a redshift in the range @xmath116 .",
    "also the number of stars ( i.e. the star formation rate time - dilated and weighted by the comoving volume of the universe ) shows two peaks at @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    in a few cases ,",
    "however , the redshifts of some dark grbs have been almost securely found , e.g. grb970828 at @xmath119 @xcite , grb 000210 at @xmath120 @xcite , grb 000214 at @xmath121 @xcite , while grb981226 is also likely to have not occurred at very high redshift @xcite , because the candidate host galaxy is still detected in the r band . with present statistics ,",
    "at least @xmath122 of the examined dark grbs are not at very large redshift .",
    "it should be noticed that two of them are included in the list of most obscure objects in our set .    an hypothesis to explain the lack of the optical emission , alternative to the very high redshift scenario , may be strong absorption @xcite .",
    "so far , we have collected many indications that grbs take place in dense environments , like the giant molecular clouds ( hereafter gmcs ) @xcite .",
    "gmcs are very rich in dust , which extinguishes very efficiently the optical and uv light .",
    "@xcite argues that in the case of grb000210 the lower limit on amount of obscuration is 1.6 magnitude in the r band .",
    "this value has been obtained extrapolating a power law spectrum , described by the fireball model , from the x - ray band to the optical band and comparing the expected flux with the upper limits .",
    "we find a similar result through our model - independent analysis of optical - to - x flux ratios .",
    "the @xmath63 upper limits of the burst is 3.8 times lower than @xmath123 , which corresponds to @xmath124 magnitude depletion .",
    "the measurements of chandra x - ray observatory showed that the amount of local absorbtion is able to explain this obscuration , under the assumption that the dust - to - gas ratio of the intervening medium is the same of the galaxy .",
    "however , we note that in the case of otgrbs the dust - to - gas ratio seems not to be consistent with the galactic one @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite derived extinction in the case of ghost grb970828 @xcite , for which a significative amount of x - ray absorption was detected .",
    "if the most obscure ghosts were similar to grbs with ot except for higher absorption , we would expect to see differences in values of @xmath125 . from our results",
    ", we can not affirm that @xmath125 in these bursts shows this tendency , also due to considerable errors ( see table 1 and figure 1 ) .",
    "for those with good statistics , we do not find any absorption value @xmath126 higher than the galactic value but marginal evidence ( @xmath127 ) . on the other hand , we can not rule out the hypothesis of obscuring gmcs altogether .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath125 , a few @xmath128 , are in fact the typical column densities of gmcs . _ the optical absorption , however , does not imply that most obscure ghosts have x - ray flux weaker than otgrbs , as we have found in our analysis , _ because x - ray absorption is almost negligible at energy larger than 1.6 kev .",
    "reichart & yost ( 2001 ) try to reconcile this fact with the hypothesis of dusty birthplaces for grbs and , in particular , they considered the effect of variously beamed grb fireballs on their dusty environments .",
    "the energetics of grbs are more or less the same for all events @xcite , but the beaming angles differ , being narrower for stronger bursts .",
    "the larger the beaming angle is , the more difficult it is for the diluited prompt uv and x - ray emission to destroy dust along the line of sight ( waxman & draine 2000 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2001 ; draine & hao 2002 ; perna & lazzati 2002 ) , so that we see a weak grbs without ot . with a narrower beaming angle ,",
    "the prompt emission will destroy a larger fraction of dust and the grbs will appear strong and with ot . if this hypothesis is correct , on the basis of our results we have to assume that the average beaming angle of the darkest ghosts is @xmath10 times wider than the otgrb one . according to frail et al .",
    ", the average beaming angle of bepposax ot grbs is @xmath129 , so that the average beaming angle of the darkest grbs should be @xmath130 .",
    "this prediction is important , because it can be experimentally tested by observing and timing the presence of achromatic breaks in the light curves .",
    "another consequence of dark grb occurrence in high density environments should be the detection of semi - ionized absorber in the low energy x - ray spectrum .",
    "so far , this kind of feature has not been found .",
    "the ionization front , however , should be rather sharp ( see e.g. draine & hao 2002 ) , and therefore it would be hard to detect signatures of semi - ionized species in the x - ray spectra of the bursts .",
    "we have discussed the issue of grbs with x - ray but no optical afterglows .",
    "we have performed a standard temporal and spectral analysis of a complete sample of 31 grb x - ray follow up observations of bepposax , i.e. all the fast observations from the launch until february 2001 .",
    "we have found that x - ray afterglows follow the prompt gamma emission in @xmath131 of the cases .",
    "we have obtained the 1.6 - 10 kev fluxes 11 hours after the trigger for each grb and the values of n@xmath132 at @xmath119 to compare the absorption properties for strong x - ray afterglows . while absorption of optically bright and dark grbs does not appear to be significatively different , the fluxes of grbs with ot are on average about 5 times stronger than ghost ones .",
    "the probability that ghosts and optically bright grbs belong to the same population in fluxes is @xmath133 .",
    "from the very fact that x - ray flux of dark grbs is 5 times lower than otgrbs , the optical flux could be @xmath10 magnitude lower under the assumption that the shape of the optical - to - x spectrum is the same of otgrbs .",
    "this difference could explain the non - detection of the optical transient . in order to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have calculated the optical - to - x flux ratios of otgrbs and upper limits for ghosts .",
    "otgrbs show a tight correlation of optical and x - ray fluxes .",
    "the mean for otgrbs is @xmath47 log @xmath134 @xmath54 = @xmath135 and @xmath136 ; the probability of a chance correlation is a marginal @xmath137 .",
    "we find that @xmath86 of ghosts have @xmath63 upper limits similar to otgrb ones ; however , the remaining @xmath138 of dark bursts are fainter in optical than in x - rays , being their average optical - to - x flux ratio @xmath47 log @xmath139 @xmath54 @xmath140 .",
    "thus , we have a strong indication that for these bursts the spectra are different from otgrbs .",
    "this result is significant at @xmath141 level .",
    "two different interpretations for this effect can be given : 1 ) location at @xmath142 ; 2 ) higher absorption .",
    "in the very high redshift scenario , the optical flux of the sample is extinguished by the intervening ly-@xmath101 systems , while the x - ray flux lower than otgrbs is understood in terms of a higher distance .",
    "however , given the fact that some ghosts of the sample almost certainly do not lie at very high redshift , we have considered the alternative possibility of occurrence in dusty and dense environments like gmcs .",
    "we have not found that these bursts have a higher absorption than optically bright grbs , but we note that upper limits on @xmath125 are consistent with those of giant clouds . in the case of grb000210",
    "our model - independent analysis has shown a depletion in the optical which is compatible with the x - ray absorption measured by chandra , assuming a dust - to - gas ratio similar to that of our galaxy .    in the near future , a key role will be played by fast and deep follow up x - ray and optical observations of grbs , which will allow us to constrain better their spectral properties . in particular , observations in the ir band are a really important tool because they are less sensitive to dust and to ly-@xmath101 extinction .",
    "they will enable us to investigate dark grb properties like distance , that is a crucial piece of information to disclose the nature of these objects .",
