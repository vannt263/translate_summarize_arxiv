    "complex systems in physics , engineering , biology , economics , and finance , are often characterized by the occurence of fat - tailed probability distributions . in many cases",
    "there is an asymptotic decay with a power - law . for these types of systems more general versions of statistical mechanics",
    "have been developed , in which power laws are effectively derived from maximization principles of more general entropy functions , subject to suitable constraints @xcite .",
    "typical distributions that occur in this context are of the @xmath0-exponential form . the @xmath0-exponential is defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is a real parameter , the entropic index .",
    "it has become common to call the corresponding statistics ` @xmath0-statistics ' .",
    "a possible dynamical reason for @xmath0-statistics is a so - called superstatistics @xcite . for superstatistical complex systems",
    "one has a superposition of ordinary local equilibrium statistical mechanics in local spatial cells , but there is a suitable intensive parameter @xmath2 of the complex system that fluctuates on a relatively large spatio - temporal scale .",
    "this intensive parameter may be the inverse temperature , or the amplitude of noise in the system , or the energy dissipation in turbulent flows , or an environmental parameter , or simply a local variance parameter extracted from a suitable time series generated by the complex system @xcite .",
    "the superstatistics approach has been the subject of various recent papers @xcite and it has been applied to a variety of complex driven systems , such as lagrangian@xcite and eulerian turbulence@xcite , defect turbulence@xcite , cosmic ray statistics@xcite , solar flares @xcite , environmental turbulence @xcite , hydroclimatic fluctuations @xcite , random networks @xcite , random matrix theory @xcite and econophysics @xcite . if the parameter @xmath2 is distributed according to a particular probability distribution , the @xmath3-distribution , then the corresponding superstatistics , obtained by integrating over all @xmath2 , is given by @xmath0-statistics @xcite , which means that there are @xmath0-exponentials and asymptotic power laws . for other distributions of the intensive parameter @xmath2 ,",
    "one ends up with more general asymptotic decays @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we intend to analyse yet another complex system where @xmath0-statistics seem to play an important role , and where a superstatistical model makes sense .",
    "we have analysed in detail the probability distributions of delays occuring on the british rail network . the advent of real - time train information on the internet for the british network ( http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ ldb / livedepartures.asp ) has made it possible to gather a large amount of data and therefore to study the distribution of delays .",
    "information on such delays is very valuable to the traveller .",
    "published information is limited to a single point of the distribution - for example , the fraction of trains that arrive with 5 minutes of their scheduled time .",
    "travellers thus have no information about whether the distribution has a long tail , or even about the mean delay .",
    "we find that the delays are well modelled by a @xmath0-exponential function , allowing a characterization of the distribution by two parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "we will relate our observations to a superstatistical model of train delays .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , we describe our data and the methods used for the analysis .",
    "we then present our fitting results .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that @xmath0-exponentials provide a good fit of the train delay distributions , and we will show which parameters @xmath5 are relevant for the various british rail network lines . in the final section , we will discuss a superstatistical model for train delays .",
    "we collected data on departure times for 23 major stations for the period september 2005 to october 2006 , by software which downloads the real - time information webpage every minute for each station .",
    "as each train actually departs , the most recent delay value is saved to a database .",
    "the database now contains over two million train departures ; for a busy station such as manchester piccadilly over 200,000 departures are recorded .",
    "preliminary investigation led us to believe that the model @xmath6 would fit well ; here @xmath7 is the delay , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are shape parameters , and @xmath10 is a normalization parameter .",
    "we have @xmath11 as @xmath12 and @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "these limiting forms allow an initial estimate of the parameters ; an accurate estimate is then obtained by nonlinear least - squares .",
    "we also have @xmath15 so that @xmath0 measures the deviation from an exponential distribution .",
    "an estimated @xmath0 larger than unity indicates a long - tailed distribution .",
    "we did not include the zero - delay value in the fitted models .",
    "typically 80% of trains record @xmath16 , indicating a delay of one minute or less ( the resolution of the data ) .",
    "thus , our model represents the conditional probability distribution of the delay , given that the train is delayed one minute or more .    in order to provide meaningful parameter confidence intervals",
    ", we weighted the data as follows . since our data is in the form of a histogram , the distribution of the height @xmath17 of the bar representing the count of trains with delay @xmath18 will be binomial .",
    "in fact , it is of course very close to gaussian whenever @xmath17 is large enough , which is the case nearly always . the normalized height @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the total number of trains ) will therefore have standard deviation @xmath21 .",
    "we used these values as weights in the nonlinear least squares procedure , and hence computed parameter confidence intervals by standard methods , namely from the estimated parameter covariance matrix .",
    "we find that typically @xmath0 and @xmath4 have a correlation coefficient of about @xmath22 ; thus , the very small confidence intervals quoted in the figure captions for @xmath4 are not particularly useful ; @xmath4 typically acquires a larger uncertainty via its correlation with @xmath0 .",
    "we first fitted the model to all data , obtaining the fit shown in figure  [ _ ] .",
    "this corresponds to a ` universality ' assumption - if all routes had the same distribution of delays , the parameter values @xmath23 would be the relevant ones .",
    "we may thus compare the parameters for specific routes with these .",
    "typical fits for three such routes are shown in fig .",
    "[ bth_pad ] , fig .",
    "[ swi_pad ] , and fig .",
    "[ rdg_pad ] .",
    "-exponential : @xmath24 , @xmath25 . ]",
    "delays typically build up over a train s journey , and are very unlikely at the initial departure station .",
    "thus , we choose to study delays at intermediate stations . at such stations ,",
    "a delayed departure almost certainly means the arrival was delayed .    , @xmath26 .",
    "]    , @xmath27 . ]    , @xmath28 . ]",
    "we start with a very simple model for the local departure statistics of trains .",
    "the waiting time distribution until departure takes place is simply given by that of a poisson process @xcite @xmath29 here @xmath7 is the time delay from the scheduled departure time , and @xmath2 is a positive parameter .",
    "the symbol @xmath30 denotes the conditional probability density to observe the delay @xmath7 provided the parameter @xmath2 has a certain given value . clearly , the above probability density is normalized .",
    "large values of @xmath2 mean that most trains depart very well in time , whereas small @xmath2 describe a situation where long delays are rather frequent .",
    "the above simple exponential model becomes superstatistical by making the parameter @xmath2 a fluctuating random variable as well .",
    "these fluctuations describe large - scale temporal variations of the british rail network environment . for example , during the start of the holiday season , when there is many passengers , we expect that @xmath2 is smaller than usual for a while , resulting in frequent delays .",
    "similarly , if there is a problem with the track or if bad weather conditions exist , we also expect smaller values of @xmath2 on average .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is also be influenced by extreme events such as derailments , industrial action , terror alerts , etc .",
    "the observed long - term distribution of train delays is then a mixture of exponential distributions where the parameter @xmath2 fluctuates .",
    "if @xmath2 is distributed with probability density @xmath31 , and fluctuates on a large time scale , then one obtains the marginal distributions of train delays as @xmath32 it is this marginal distribution that is actually recorded in our data files .",
    "let us now construct a simple model for the distribution @xmath31",
    ". there may be @xmath20 different gaussian random variables @xmath33 , that influence the dynamics of the positive random variable @xmath2 in an additive way @xcite .",
    "we may thus assume as a very simple model that @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in this case the probability density of @xmath2 is given by a @xmath3-distribution with @xmath20 degrees of freedom : @xmath37 the average of @xmath2 is given by @xmath38 and the variance by @xmath39    the integral ( [ 9 ] ) is easily evaluated and one obtains @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "our model generates @xmath0-exponential distributions of train delays by a simple mechanism , namely a @xmath3-distributed parameter @xmath2 of the local poisson process .",
