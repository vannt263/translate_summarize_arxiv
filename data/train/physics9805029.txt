    "it has recently been shown that in large systems of independent `` agents '' , the interplay of two different types of noise can lead to power - law distributed quantities , like life - times of the agents , or sizes of reorganization events  @xcite .",
    "one of the two noises , usually referred to as stress , has to act coherently on all agents , while the other one , usually referred to as mutation or reloading , has to act individually on each agent , and on a much longer time scale .",
    "mechanisms of this kind have been called `` coherent - noise '' mechanisms .",
    "models incorporating coherent - noise mechanisms have been put forward to explain effects seen in earthquakes , rice - piles , or biological evolution and extinction  @xcite .    in most applications , however , it is hard to justify a single stress imposed on the whole system at once . in  @xcite ,",
    "the stress was identified with global influences on the biosphere , as in the case of extraterrestrial impacts  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , there are more reasons for species to go extinct than impacts . often , species extinction is a local phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "for example , species living in a small territory regularly die out because of the invasion of a new species , able to exploit their ecological niche more effectively .",
    "a similar argument applies to the situation of earthquakes . in",
    "@xcite the stress has been interpreted as background noise with long wavelength , generated by some distant external source . nonetheless , in a large fault system , we would expect background noise to be present also locally , and probably on smaller and larger scales at the same time  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to advance a model that , while incorporating the basic ideas of coherent - noise systems , can deal with more complex situations by considering stress on different scales .",
    "a short account of this work has already been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "there , only regular trees ( see below ) have been treated .",
    "it is an observation from every - day life , as well as from many physical systems  @xcite , that very often objects or agents are embedded into a hierarchy of different contexts , all having influences on them .",
    "mathematically , this idea can be described with the concept of ultrametricity  @xcite , which means there exists a distance @xmath2 such that the triangle inequality @xmath3 holds for any three agents @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "geometrically , an ultrametric space can be conceived of as a cayley - tree . in the following ,",
    "vertices in the tree connected to exactly one other vertex will be called leaves , and vertices connected to two or more other vertices will be called nodes . in this paper",
    ", the nodes of the tree stand for different contexts , and the agents are placed at the tree s leaves .",
    "we can formulate a generalization of the original coherent - noise model by incorporating the above ideas .",
    "our system consists of @xmath7 agents , each represented by a real number ( threshold ) @xmath8 , or , in the general case , a vector @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , we choose a tree with @xmath10 nodes and @xmath11 leaves , which means @xmath12 vertices in total .",
    "the tree will be kept fixed throughout the simulation . at every leaf we put exactly one agent . for every node @xmath13 of the tree",
    "we choose a stress distribution with probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath14 .",
    "additionally , we also choose a stress distribution for every leaf of the tree , so that we have a stress distribution for every vertex of the tree .",
    "the stress distributions at the leaves allow to simulate extremely localized influences acting on only a single agent .",
    "the total number of stresses in the system is therefore @xmath15 .",
    "the course of the simulation runs as follows . at the beginning",
    ", the agents are initialized with random thresholds drawn from a distribution @xmath16 . then ,",
    "in every time step , three actions are performed : i ) from each of the @xmath17 stress distributions , a stress @xmath18 is chosen at random .",
    "ii ) for every agent @xmath19 , from all the @xmath20 stress values @xmath21 above the agent in the tree , a stress @xmath22 is calculated according to some function @xmath23 : @xmath24 if @xmath25 , agent @xmath19 is removed and replaced by a new one with a threshold chosen at random from @xmath26 .",
    "iii ) finally , every agent has a small probability @xmath27 to get a new threshold , again from the distribution @xmath16 .",
    "action  iii ) represents the mutation or reloading mentioned in the introduction .",
    "there are a number of reasonable choices for the function @xmath28 . in this paper",
    ", we will mainly study the `` maximum rule '' , which reads @xmath29 another natural choice is to sum up the stresses , i.e. , to use @xmath30 this alternative , which we will call `` sum rule '' , will also be discussed in this paper .",
    "the effective stress an agent feels can be calculated exactly in the case of the maximum rule , eq .",
    "( [ eq : funcamax ] ) .",
    "the agent is subjected to the stress distribution at its leaf and to the stress distributions at the nodes above it .",
    "let there be @xmath31 nodes above the leaf of an agent .",
    "then the @xmath32 stress values having influence on this agent are @xmath32 random variables @xmath33 with pdf s @xmath34 . to obtain the effective stress distribution",
    ", we have to calculate the pdf @xmath35 of the random variable @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 note that @xmath38 the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : max_calc ] ) with respect to @xmath39 yields @xmath40 eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) is the exact expression for the effective stress on an agent in the case of the maximum rule eq .",
    "( [ eq : funcamax ] ) .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) is dominated by the slowest decaying stress distribution .",
    "we say that a distribution @xmath41 decays slower than another distribution @xmath14 if there exists a @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for a set of reasonable stress distributions it is always possible to identify the distribution @xmath44 that is falling off slowest according to this definition .",
    "hence , we find for the pdf of the effective stress on an agent @xmath45    a similar statement can not easily be proved for the sum rule . however , in special cases the necessary calculations can be done .",
    "consider , for example , the case of exponential stress distributions @xmath46 . in this case",
    ", we find @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "a similar result can be found in the case of stress distributions with power - law tails  @xcite .",
    "it seems that in most of the reasonable cases , the sum of the stresses will be dominated by a single distribution in the limit of large stresses , as in the situation of the maximum of the stresses .",
    "in this section we are interested in trees which are constructed as follows .",
    "we begin with a single leaf and convert it into a node by connecting to it @xmath49 new leaves .",
    "then we repeat this procedure for every new leaf .",
    "we stop the construction when we have reached a depth of @xmath50 iterations .",
    "trees generated in this way are called regular trees  @xcite .",
    "the tree displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ranking ] is a regular tree with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the number of leaves in a regular tree is @xmath53 and the number of vertices is @xmath54 therefore , we have @xmath55 agents in such a tree , and @xmath56 stress values have to be generated in every time step .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff_dist ] that every agent feels effectively a single stress distribution in the limit of large stresses ( eqns .",
    "( [ eq : maxlimit ] ) , ( [ eq : exp_stresslimit ] ) ) . since for coherent - noise systems ,",
    "large stresses give the main contribution to the systems behavior , the stress distributions that are falling of very slowly dominate large parts of the tree .",
    "hence , the tree breaks down into subsystems that are to some extent decoupled from each other . for regular trees , it is relatively easy to study the average distribution of the subsystems sizes analytically .",
    "we assume for any two stress distributions @xmath57 in the tree we can identify one of the two that is falling off slower , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fall_off_slower ] ) .",
    "this is not a severe restriction , as we have noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff_dist ] .",
    "additionally , we restrict ourselves to situations in which @xmath41 and @xmath14 are equally likely to fall off slower than the respective other . under these conditions",
    ", we can rank all stress distributions in a tree , assigning rank 1 to the one that is falling off fastest , and assigning correspondingly higher ranks to the ones that are falling off slower .",
    "this makes the calculation of the subsystems sizes relatively easy . for every single agent",
    ", we have to identify the corresponding highest rank placed above it in the tree ( which we will call the rank of the agent ) .",
    "then , we simply have to count the number of agents with the same rank .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ranking ] .",
    "we expect the mean distribution of subsystems sizes to have sharp peaks whenever the size of a complete subtree is reached , because the probability for a single rank to be higher than all others further down the tree should be larger than the probability for a complicated arrangement of ranks to produce a subsystem of a certain size .",
    "the size @xmath0 of a subsystem is the number of leaves in that subsystem .",
    "the functional dependency of the peaks at size @xmath0 is calculated as follows .",
    "the expected frequency @xmath58 of independent subtrees of depth @xmath59 , corresponding to a subsystem of size @xmath60 , can be written as the number of such subtrees in the whole system , @xmath61 , times the probability that any of these subtrees will be independent of the rest , @xmath62 .",
    "hence we write @xmath63 the number of subtrees of size @xmath64 is @xmath65 a subtree is independent of the rest if the rank at its root is higher than all other ranks in the subtree and at the nodes above the subtree .",
    "the probability @xmath66 is therefore the reciprocal of the number of vertices in the subtree plus the number of vertices above the subtree , hence @xmath67 if we increase @xmath59 by one , we get @xmath68 . with slightly more effort , we find also @xmath69 therefore , we can write @xmath70 which implies @xmath71",
    ".    this result is interesting .",
    "the frequency of subsystems of size @xmath0 scales as @xmath1 , independent of the parameter @xmath49 which characterizes the structure of the tree .",
    "we have tested these predictions by measuring the frequency @xmath58 in computer experiments .",
    "our simulations are set up as follows .",
    "we choose a tree with @xmath56 vertices in total . for several thousand times",
    ", we assign the integers from 1 to @xmath56 randomly to the vertices of the tree .",
    "the integers stand for the rank of the stress - distributions at the vertices .",
    "for every single realization of this process , we determine the sizes of the subsystems the tree breaks down into , and compute a histogram of the sizes frequencies .",
    "finally , we calculate the average over all histograms .",
    "[ fig : parts ] shows the results of such measurements for two different trees with 10 000 histograms each .",
    "we can see clear peaks at powers of @xmath49 , which correspond to complete subtrees .",
    "we also find the heights of the peaks to decrease as @xmath1 , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : regtreescaling ] ) .",
    "the regular trees treated in the previous section can be easily generalized to a broader class of trees , which we will call `` random trees '' .",
    "only a small change in the construction algorithm is necessary . to construct a regular tree , in every iteration step we connect @xmath49 new leaves to every leaf of the previous step .",
    "the straightforward generalization of this procedure is to choose a random number of new leaves for every leaf of the previous construction step . to avoid confusion with the parameter @xmath49",
    ", we will call this random number @xmath72 .",
    "the random variable @xmath72 will take value @xmath19 with probability @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we denote the mean of @xmath72 by @xmath77 and the variance by @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , we assume @xmath79 in all cases considered in this paper . in the limit @xmath80",

    "the construction of a random tree as prescribed above is a branching process with @xmath50 generations . from the theory of branching processes  @xcite , we know that for large @xmath50 the number of leaves in the tree will be @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a random variable with mean @xmath84 .",
    "the factor @xmath83 takes into account fluctuations that happen at the beginning of the tree s construction .",
    "correspondingly , for the total number of vertices in the tree we use the approximation @xmath85 the above two equations are the generalizations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nleavesreg ] ) , ( [ eq : nvertreg ] ) for random trees .    as in the case of regular trees , we are interested in the quantity @xmath58 , the expected frequency with which independent subsystems of size @xmath0 occur . in the previous section we made the assumption that the main contributions to @xmath58 come from complete subtrees .",
    "the comparison with numerical data showed that this assumption leads to a good understanding of the structure of @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , in the case of random trees we also assume that we can concentrate on complete subtrees .",
    "the number of subtrees of size @xmath0 in a large tree is on average the size of the tree ( which is the number of leaves in the tree ) divided by @xmath0 .",
    "hence we have @xmath86 which is equivalent to eq .",

    "consider first the case of a very small @xmath0 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath104 , because we always assume @xmath105 ( otherwise , the tree would have roughly a depth of 1 , which would not be very interesting ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is close to @xmath106 , the number of subtrees of size @xmath0 depends strongly on the exact form of the probability distribution of @xmath72 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsubrand ] ) is no longer valid .",

    "as the main result of sections  [ sec : regtrees ] and  [ sec : randtrees ] , we found the distribution of independent subsystems of size @xmath0 in the tree to be proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in the limit of large stress values @xmath112 , we expect the tree model to behave like an ensemble of coherent - noise models whose sizes scale as @xmath1 .",
    "when constructing the ensemble approximation of a certain tree , we have to choose the right stress distribution for every coherent - noise model in the ensemble . in principle , this can be a complicated task . however , we have found that a very simple approach instead works sufficiently well in many cases .",

    "[ fig : stresses ] . there ,",
    "we have recorded the average ranks of the subsystems in a tree .",
    "interestingly , the average rank varies only very little with the subsystem s size @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in a further approximation , we assume that all the stress - distributions that dominate a subsystem have the same rank , i.e. , they are all the same ( we use a single _ stress distribution _ , but the _ stress values _ are still chosen independently for all systems in the ensemble ) .",
    "our numerical simulations show the similarity between the tree model and the ensemble .",
    "we begin with results for the maximum rule .      like in previous work  @xcite ,",
    "an `` event '' is the reorganization of agents because of stress in a single time step .",
    "the size of an event is the total number of agents hit by the stress .",

    "the heights of the curves reflect the total number of events we recorded for each model and have no special meaning .",
    "the sizes of the systems in the ensemble are exactly the ones we obtained for the sizes of the tree s subsystems while doing the ranking procedure described in sec .",

    "the distribution of these sizes is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : exdist1 ] .    the tree used in fig .",

    "the stress distribution used in the ensemble is an exponential with @xmath115 .    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : exdist1 ] , the tree model and the ensemble behave very similar with regard to event sizes . in both cases , we find approximately a power - law decrease .",

    "fig : aftershocks ] .",
    "the results for the tree model and for the ensemble are very similar . however , at an event - size of about 1000 , the frequency distribution for the ensemble falls off rather quickly , whereas the frequency distribution for the tree has an additional peak at about 1400 .",
    "it is this peak that causes the shift of the probability @xmath122 in the tree model for large @xmath124 .",
    "the peak in the tree model arises because from time to time a very large stress will be generated at the root of the tree , causing an event of the order of the tree s size . in the ensemble ,",
    "on the other hand , events larger than the largest subsystem are extremely unlikely .      the lifetime of an agent is the time an agent remains in the system without being hit by stress . in the original coherent - noise model ,",
    "the agents lifetimes are distributed as a power - law with exponent @xmath129  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath130 depends on the stress distribution , and it is related to the mean - field exponent @xmath131 of the event size distribution by @xmath132 . for exponential stress ,",

    "this steeper distribution shows that the conception of a tree being equivalent to an ensemble of coherent - noise models is less accurate when stresses are summed up .",

    ", we were able to show that in hierarchical contexts , coherence can arise naturally in large subsystems . in the tree models we presented ,",
    "the system breaks down into a number of subsystems , each of them having a high degree of coherence and being largely independent of the rest .",
    "interestingly , the number of subsystems of size @xmath0 decreases as @xmath1 for a large class of different trees .",
    "the emergence of coherent subsystems is closely connected to the domination of some stress distributions by others .",
    "we should always observe this phenomenon if the function @xmath23 is proportional to a single stress distribution in the limit of large stresses .",
    "we made also an interesting observation about the agents lifetimes .",
    "we found the distribution of lifetimes to be the same in the tree model and in coherent - noise models , as long as the stress distributions in both models have the same functional dependency .",
    "furthermore , from the arguments given in section  [ sec : lifetimes ] we can deduce an even more general statement . in any system where agents under the influence of stress are modeled as in coherent - noise systems ,",
    "the distribution of the agents lifetimes will be a power - law , even if there is no correlation between stresses different agents feel .",
    "this is a new explanation for the appearance of power - law distributed life - times or waiting - times in non - equilibrium systems valid under extremely weak conditions .",
    "further work extending the tree model presented here could address appearance and disappearance of agents .",
    "if we consider , for example , the case of biological evolution and extinction , the biodiversity is constantly changing , with the main tendency of exponential growth throughout the past 1000 million years  @xcite ( this trend , however , has changed dramatically nowadays , because of ever increasing human activity  @xcite ) .",
    "`` real '' extinction and speciation could be incorporated into the tree model by removing from the tree the agents hit by stress , as it has been done already in the case of coherent - noise models  @xcite . related to this",
    ", one could consider trees changing their structure .",
    "up to now , we studied only fixed trees , mainly for reasons of simplicity .",
    "another extension could be the consideration of vector stresses , as it has been done by sneppen and newman for the original coherent - noise model  @xcite , inspired by a similar generalization of the bak - sneppen model  @xcite .",
    "we thank thomas daube for useful comments at an early stage of the manuscript and xavier gabaix for pointing us to a simplified calculation of the effective stress distribution .",
    "we also would like to thank our unknown referee for his useful suggestions ."
