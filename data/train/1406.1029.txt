    "spin transport electronics ( spintronics ) has recently attracted enormous attention mainly because of its promising applications in information storage and processing and other electronic technologies@xcite .",
    "spin current generation , detection and manipulation are three key issues in the emerging spintronics .",
    "large intrinsic spin hall effect ( she ) in platinum has recently been predicted@xcite and observed ( see refs . and and references therein ) . in the she ,",
    "a transverse spin current is generated in response to an electric field in a metal with relativistic electron interaction .",
    "the she enables us to generate and control spin current without magnetic field or magnetic materials , which would be an important step for spintronics .",
    "furthermore , in the inverse spin hall effect , a transverse voltage drop arises due to the spin current@xcite , and this allows us to detect spin current by measuring the hall voltage .",
    "therefore , platinum has been widely used as a spin current generator and detector in recent spin current experiments , such as spin seebeck effect@xcite , spin pumping@xcite and spin hall switching@xcite , and plays a unique role in recent developments in spintronics .",
    "platinum is an enhanced paramagnet because its 5@xmath8-band is partially filled with a large density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath9 ) [ @xmath101.74 states / ev / spin ] .",
    "consequently , it could become ferromagnetic with a significant spin magnetic moment when placed next to a ferromagnetic metal@xcite or in low - dimensional structures such as an atomic bilayer on silver ( 001 ) surface@xcite or a freestanding atomic chain@xcite .",
    "indeed , platinum was reported to possess a magnetic moment as large as @xmath110.2 and @xmath110.5 @xmath12/atom in ni / pt and fe / pt multilayers@xcite , respectively . in a ferromagnetic metal , a transverse charge current would be generated in response to an electric field due to relativistic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , an effect known as the anomalous hall effect ( ahe)@xcite , discovered by hall@xcite long ago .",
    "since the ahe is another archetypal spin - related transport phenomenon@xcite and the soc strength in pt is large , it would be interesting to study the ahe in the proximity - induced ferromagnetic platinum .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in ref . , the fact that the hall voltage could be generated by both the ahe and inverse she in the magnetized platinum , might complicate the detection of the pure spin current and also related phenomena using platinum . therefore , it is important to understand the transport and magnetic properties of the magentized platinum .    in a ferromagnet ,",
    "the hall voltage could also arise when a thermal gradient instead of an electric field , is applied .",
    "this phenomenon , again due to the relativistic soc , is refered to as the anomalous nernst effect ( ane)@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the ane could be used as a probe of the vortex phase in type ii superconductors@xcite and has been receiving considerable attention in recent years.@xcite in this context , it would be interesting to study the ane in the proximity - induced ferromagnetic platinum . on the other hand , spin seebeck effect ( another thermal phenomenon ) , which refers to the generation of a spin - motive force in a ferromagnet by a temperature gradient ,",
    "has recently attracted considerable attention@xcite .",
    "again , this effect is usually measured as a transverse voltage in a nonmagnetic metal such as pt in contact with the ferromagnet via the inverse she@xcite . clearly ,",
    "if the metal is magnetized due to the magnetic proximity effect , the ane would contribute to the measured hall voltage too .",
    "in this connection , it is imperative to understand the ane in the magnetized platinum .",
    "palladium is isoelectronic to platinum and thus has an electronic structure similar to that of pt except a smaller soc strength ( see , e.g. , refs . and and references therein ) .",
    "for example , like pt , pd also has a large intrinsic spin hall conductivity ( shc)@xcite and is a highly enhanced paramagnetic metal with a large @xmath102.69 states / ev / spin .",
    "in fact , palladium possesses the largest paramagnetic susceptibility of @xmath13 emu / mole among the nonmagnetic metals@xcite and is usually considered to be nearly ferromagnetic .",
    "it could become ferromagnetic when placed next to a ferromagnetic metal@xcite or fabricated as an atomic bilayer on silver ( 001 ) surface@xcite or a freestanding atomic chain@xcite .",
    "recently , the ahe was observed in the pd film on an yttrium iron garnet ( yig).@xcite surprisingly , it was reported that the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) in the pd film on the yig layer has a sign opposite to that for the pt / yig bilayer.@xcite this indicates that the ahc in a magnetized nonmagnetic metal does not simply scale with the soc strength .",
    "one would then ask what determines the ahc in the magnetized metals .    in this paper , therefore , we study the ahe and ane in the proximity - induced ferromagnetic platinum and palladium within the berry phase formalism@xcite based on first - principle relativistic band structure calculations . we also perform analytic calculations to identify possible relations between the shc in an nonmagnetic metal and the ahc in the corresponding magnetized metal .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly describe the berry phase formalism for calculating the ahc and anc as well as the computational details . in sec .",
    "iii , the calculated ahc and anc will be presented .",
    "finally , the conclusions drawn from this work will be summarized in sec .",
    "the anomalous hall conductivity and anomalous nernst conductivity ( anc ) are calculated by using the berry - phase formalism@xcite . within this berry - phase formalism , the ahc is simply given as a brillouin zone ( bz ) integration of the berry curvature for all the occupied bands , @xmath14 }   { ( \\epsilon_{{\\bf k}n}-\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}n'})^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the fermi distribution function and the berry curvature for the @xmath17th band at @xmath18 , respectively.@xcite similarly",
    ", the anc can be written as @xmath19,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the chemical potential and @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant.@xcite    the proximity - induced ferromagnetic platinum and palladium are investigated by the constrained spin - density functional theory with the local density approximation to the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite spin - polarized self - consistent scalar - relativistic electronic structure calculations with the spin magnetic moment fixed to specified values , are performed . using the resultant self - consistent charge densities , the fully relativistic band structures",
    "are then calculated for the ahc and anc calculations .",
    "the highly accurate all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method , as implemented in the wien2k code@xcite , is used .",
    "the experimental lattice constants @xmath22 and 3.89 (  ) are used , respectively , for pt and pd . in both cases , the muffin - tin sphere radius ( @xmath23 ) of 2.5 a.u .",
    "is adopted .",
    "the wave function , charge density , and potential are expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics inside the muffin - tin spheres and the cutoff angular moment ( @xmath24 ) used is 10 , 6 and 6 , respectively .",
    "the wave function outside the muffin - tin sphere is expanded in terms of the augmented plane waves ( apws ) and a large number of apws ( about 70 apws per atom , i. e. , the maximum size of the crystal momentum @xmath25 ) are included in the present calculations .",
    "the tetrahedron method is used for the bz integration@xcite . to obtain accurate ground state properties , a fine 21@xmath2621@xmath2621 grid of 11616 @xmath27-points in the first bz",
    "is used . for the ahc and anc calculations , a very find grid of 258156 @xmath27-points on the magnetic irreducible wedge ( 1/16 bz ) in the bz",
    "this is equivalent to a large number of @xmath27-points of @xmath28 in the full bz , and corresponds to the division of the @xmath29 line into 70 intervals .",
    "comparison with test calculations with a denser grid of 381915 @xmath27-points ( 80 divisions of the @xmath29 line ) indicates that the calculated ahc and anc converge to within a few % .",
    "the relativistic band structure and also ahc ( @xmath0 ) as a function of the fermi energy ( @xmath9 ) for the magnetized platinum and palladium with the spin magnetic moment @xmath30 @xmath12/atom are displayed in figs . 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "all kramer - degenerate bands in nonmagnetic platinum ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) and palladium ( see fig",
    ". 1 in @xcite ) are now exchange - split due to the induced magnetization in the magnetized pt and pd .",
    "this is clearly visible for the @xmath8-dominated bands [ i.e. , energy bands below 1.0 ev in fig .",
    "1(a ) or 0.5 ev in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] since the ferromagnetism is mainly caused by the exchange interaction among the @xmath8-electrons . the band spin - splittings are largest in the flat bands of almost pure @xmath8 character such as the bands around 0.5 ev ( 0.3 ev ) in the vicinity of the w - point in fig .",

    "figures 3 and 4 show the calculated ahc and anc ( @xmath1 ) as well as the exchange splitting ( @xmath3 ) as a function of the induced spin magnetic moment ( @xmath7 ) in platinum and palladium , respectivelty .",
    "@xmath3 refers to the splitting of the spin - up and spin - down bands , and we calculate @xmath3 as the spin splitting of the scalar - relativistic bands above the fermi level at the w - point [ figs .",
    "1(a ) and 2(a ) ] .",
    "first of all , it is clear from figs . 3 and 4 that the calculated @xmath0 and @xmath3 increase monotonically with @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 is almost perfectly proportional to @xmath7 , while the amplitude of the @xmath0 increases linearly with @xmath7 for small @xmath7 values up to 0.30 and 0.25 @xmath12/atom for pt and pd , respectively .",
    "secondly , the ahc is large . in particular ,",
    "the magnitude of the ahc per @xmath12 ( @xmath31 ) for @xmath32 @xmath12/atom in pt and pd is , respectively , @xmath11790 and 3500 s/(@xmath33 ) , being much larger than that of @xmath11360 s/(@xmath33 ) in iron@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the ratio @xmath31 for pt is smaller than that for pd , indicating that the ahc in a proximity - induced ferromagnetic metal is not necessarily correlated with the soc strength .",
    "thirdly , the sign of the ahc in pt is opposite to that in pd , being in good agreement with the recent experiments on the pt / yig and pd / yig bilayers@xcite .",

    "exchange splitting ( @xmath3 ) is displayed as a function of @xmath7 in the inset in ( a ) . in ( b ) , @xmath34 denotes temperature.,width=264 ]      in order to gain insight into the key factors that determine the ahc in a magnetized nonmagnetic metal , let us consider the two - current model to connect the conductivities for the different sorts of hall effects . within the two - current model approximation , @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be written as@xcite @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the spin - up and spin - down hall conductivities , respectively . in a non - magnetic metal ,",
    "the spin magnetic moment @xmath41 and thus , @xmath42 . in the magnetized metal , @xmath43 , where @xmath3 is the exchange splitting and is proportional to @xmath7 , as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "3(a ) and fig .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath44 equation ( 3 ) tells us that the ahc is proportional to the energy derivative of the spin hall conductivity [ @xmath2 ] as well as the exchange splitting ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "interestingly , the soc strength does not appear explicitly in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , in contrary to conventional wisdom .",
    "we notice that platinum and palladium have similar ahc - versus - energy [ @xmath46 curves which have a prominent peak near the @xmath9 ( see fig . 1 in both @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". however , the @xmath9 falls on the up - hill side of the peak in pt@xcite but on the down - hill side of the peak in pd@xcite , resulting in the positive @xmath6 for pt and negative @xmath6 for pd .",
    "this , together with eq .",
    "( 3 ) , naturally explains why both the calculated and observed ahcs in pt and pd have opposite signs .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) spin hall conductivity ( @xmath2 ) as a function of energy in nonmagnetic pt and pd metals .",
    "the vertical dotted line at 0 ev indicates the fermi energy ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "( 3 ) , here we repeat the calculations of the shc for pt@xcite and pd@xcite but using the more accurate flapw method with the same computational details as described already in sec .",
    "the calculated shc for pt and pd as a function of energy is displayed in fig .",
    "the @xmath2 at the @xmath9 is 2200 ( @xmath48/e)s / cm for pt and 1242 ( @xmath48/e)s / cm for pd , being in good agreement with the corresponding results calculated previously using the linear muffin - tin orbital method with the atomic sphere approximation.@xcite we then evaluate numerically the energy derivative of the shc using the @xmath50 displayed in fig . 5 .",
    "we obtain @xmath49 and -4245 ( @xmath48/e)s / cm - ev for pt and pd , respectively .",
    "figures 3(a ) and 4(a ) also show the @xmath0 evaluated using eq .",
    "( 3 ) together with the calculated @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( 3 ) holds very well for small @xmath7 up to @xmath110.25 @xmath12/atom for pt and pd [ figs .",
    "3(a ) and 4(a ) ] .",
    "we have also calculated the shc in the magnetized pt and pd metals .",
    "the calculated shc for pt and pd is shown as a function of the spin magnetic moment in fig .",
    "in both pt and pd , the shc initially increases with @xmath7 up to @xmath110.1 @xmath12/atom and then decreases slowly as @xmath7 further increases [ fig .",
    "nevertheless , the shc for both pt and pd remains in the same order of magnitude all the way up to @xmath7 = 0.5 @xmath12/atom .",
    "the validity of eq .",
    "( 3 ) may be understood at the microscopic level .",
    "the two - current model can be derived from an approximation in which the spin - flipping part of the soc is ignored .",
    "the spin - conserving part of the soc can still lead to nontrivial results on the transverse transport coefficients .",
    "this non - flip approximation can be justified for crystals with inversion symmetry and in the limit of zero magnetization .",
    "this is because that kramer s theorem implies a two - fold degeneracy of the band structure at general @xmath27-points even in the presence of the soc .",
    "the soc term in the hamiltonian , being symmetric under spatial inversion and time reversal , must behave as a constant within the degenerate space .",
    "therefore , it must also commute with the representation of the spin operator within the two - fold degenerate space .",
    "in the presence of a small magnetization , the degenerate bands are split to first order in the zeeman energy according to the representation of the spin operator within each of the original degenerate space .",
    "not being able to mix these split levels directly , the spin - flip part of the soc term in the hamiltonian can be safely discarded , because its residual effect must be of second order ( in a process going out and back to the degenerate space ) .",
    "figures 3(b ) and 4(b ) indicate firstly that the anomalous nernst conductivity @xmath1 increases monotonically with the spin moment @xmath7 for @xmath7 up to at least 0.5 @xmath12/atom in pt and for @xmath7 up to 0.25 @xmath12/atom in pd . like @xmath0 , @xmath1 is approximately proportional to @xmath7 for @xmath51 @xmath12/atom in both pt and pd .",
    "secondly , the calculated @xmath1 is large , especially in pt [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] . in fact , @xmath1 for pt at @xmath52 @xmath12/atom could be ten times larger than the intrinsic @xmath1 [ @xmath1/t = @xmath53 a/(m - k@xmath54 ) at @xmath55 k ] of iron@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1 for pd for @xmath56 @xmath12/atom is also several times larger than that of iron@xcite .    at low temperatures , eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be simplified as the mott relation , @xmath57 which relates the anc to the ahc .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the magnetized platinum has a very large @xmath1 since the @xmath9 is located on the steep slope of @xmath58 [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , resulting in a large energy derivative of @xmath58 at @xmath9 . in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) , the @xmath1 calculated using the mott relation [ eq .",
    "( 4 ) ] is displayed as a function of the induced @xmath7 .",
    "clearly , @xmath1 calculated directly [ eq . ( 2 ) ] and using the mott relation at @xmath59 k are in good agreement with each other for pt [ see fig .",
    "3(b ) ] and also for @xmath60 @xmath12/atom for pd [ see fig .",
    "4(b ) ] . on the other hand , @xmath1 at @xmath61 k",
    "calculated directly differs noticeably from that from the mott relation , indicating that @xmath61 k can not be considered as a low temperature in this context .",
    "differentiating eq .",
    "( 3 ) and substituting the result into eq . ( 4 ) , we find @xmath62 eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) indicate that for small @xmath7 , both the ahc and anc are proportional to the exchange - splitting . as mentioned above",
    ", the exchange - splitting is almost a perfect linear function of @xmath7 , and hence this explains why both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are approximately proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , this suggests that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are proportional to each other for small @xmath7 , as shown in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 . therefore , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 3 ) as @xmath63m_s = \\beta m_s,\\ ] ] where constant @xmath64 can be determined solely by first - principle calculations for a certain spin moment @xmath65 . in the present work",
    ", we find that @xmath66 s / cm/@xmath12 for pt and @xmath67 s / cm/@xmath12 for pd .",
    "similarly , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 4 ) as @xmath68m_s = \\gamma m_s.\\ ] ] and using the results of the first - principle calculations , we obtain that constant @xmath69 a/(m - k@xmath70 ) for pt and @xmath71 a/(m - k@xmath70 ) for pd .",
    "recently , the possible magnetic proximity - induced spin moment in pt films in the pt / yig bilayers was measured by magnetic x - ray circular dichroism experiments@xcite , and @xmath7 was found to be 0.054 @xmath12/atom at 300 k and 0.076 @xmath12/atom at 20 k. using @xmath72 @xmath12/atom together with eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we can estimate the intrinsic ahc and anc for the pt film to be @xmath0 = 40 s / cm and @xmath1 = 0.51 a/(m - k@xmath54 ) ( @xmath61 k ) .",

    "<S> we study the anomalous nernst effect ( ane ) and anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in proximity - induced ferromagnetic palladium and platinum which is widely used in spintronics , within the berry phase formalism based on the relativistic band structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the anomalous hall ( @xmath0 ) and nernst ( @xmath1 ) conductivities can be related to the spin hall conductivity ( @xmath2 ) and band exchange - splitting ( @xmath3 ) by relations @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these relations would predict that the @xmath0 in the magnetized pt ( pd ) would be positive ( negative ) since the @xmath6 is positive ( negative ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are approximately proportional to the induced spin magnetic moment ( @xmath7 ) because the @xmath3 is a linear function of @xmath7 . using the reported @xmath7 in the magnetized pt and pd </S>",
    "<S> , we predict that the intrinsic anomalous nernst conductivity ( anc ) in the magnetic platinum and palladium would be gigantic , being up to ten times larger than , e.g. , iron , while the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) would also be significant . </S>"
