    "recent progress in nanotechnologies , molecular electronics and quantum computing reinvigorated the interest to low - dimensional systems .",
    "special attention has focused during recent years on quantum dots , arrays of coupled quantum dots , @xcite quantum wires , spin chains or ladders .",
    "another class of physical systems where low - dimensionality can be achieved is ultra - cold gases in optical lattices , @xcite which form good prototype systems for investigation of many strongly - correlated effects , such as metal - insulator transition , low - dimensional superconductivity or formation of various density - wave states .",
    "the advantage of these systems is the high controllability of model parameters with external fields and preparation conditions .",
    "many of these systems display low - energy feature that fall outside the standard behavior predicted by landau s fermi liquid or symmetry breaking theories .",
    "in particular , the existence of a non - local ( string ) order parameter is proven , both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite , to be a characteristic feature of several classes of one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi-1d systems .",
    "@xcite such non - local order parameters are topologically protected against any local perturbations .",
    "the nature of these order parameters and the connection to topological invariants @xcite is well understood @xcite for spin chains with @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , the haldane conjecture @xcite proposed more than 20 years ago states that the properties of @xmath11 symmetric antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin-@xmath12 heisenberg chains differ for integer and half - integer spins .",
    "the excitations in the af heisenberg chains with half - integer spins are gapless  @xcite whereas in the integer spin case , a gap is present .",
    "the pure one - dimensional ( 1d ) af spin-@xmath13 heisenberg chain can be mapped onto a luttinger liquid which allows an exact bosonization treatment , resulting in a well understood gapless phase .",
    "@xcite in contrast , for the af spin-@xmath14 heisenberg chain it is widely accepted that the excitations exhibit a gap , thanks to extensive numerical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite analysis .    the present understanding of systems of coupled identical @xmath15 chains ( spin ladders ) is based on its similarities to larger - spin chains .",
    "this similarity allows the one - to - one translation of haldane s conjecture , originally formulated for large - spins chain , onto spin-1/2 ladders with an odd or even number of identical legs .",
    "the usual assumption about the equivalence of the individual chains constituting the ladder , is referred below as a symmetric ladder situation . while the behavior of symmetric ladders has been thoroughly investigated , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , the case of spin ladders with inequivalent legs ( asymmetric ladders ) is less understood .",
    "the behaviour of the spin gap , in particular for the case of a single chain coupled to nearly free spins ( `` dangling spins '' ) was recently discussed in @xcite , but no firm conclusions about the gap scaling in the weak coupling regime were made there .    in this work , we consider the spiral staircase heisenberg ladder ( sshl ) , consisting of of two unequal antiferromagnetically coupled spin-@xmath13 chains with a ferromagnetic ( fm ) rung coupling @xmath16 . geometrically , this model may be understood as a continuous twist deformation of an isotropic 2-leg ladder with interleg coupling @xmath0 along leg @xmath14 by an angle @xmath17 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sshl - sketch ] ) . as a result of the deformation ,",
    "the coupling between neighboring sites along leg 2 is rescaled to the form @xmath18 leading to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : sshl - hamilton1 ] ) below .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) sketch of the spiral staircase heisenberg ladder .",
    "( b ) view of the system from the top . for @xmath19",
    "the model corresponds to the standard antiferromagnetically coupled spin-@xmath13 heisenberg ladder with fm rung coupling .",

    "( b ) view of the system from the top . for @xmath19",
    "the model corresponds to the standard antiferromagnetically coupled spin-@xmath13 heisenberg ladder with fm rung coupling .",
    "the case @xmath20 corresponds to the 1d @xmath11 symmetric single - pole ladder model.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as is known from the seminal bosonization work of shelton , nersesyan and tsvelik , @xcite the fm coupling of af spin chains induces a haldane gap proportional to @xmath3 for weak interleg couplings .",
    "however , when the spin velocity on one of the legs vanishes the bosonization method fails as seen from the fact that a simple formulation of the continuum limit , on which the bosonization approach relies , is inhibited .",
    "alternative approaches , such as using other analytical or numerical methods , are then demanded . beside the theoretical interest ,",
    "an experimental motivation comes from the fact that the single - pole ladder model at @xmath20 can been used for modeling a stable organic biradical crystal pnnno .",
    "@xcite    in our previous work ( ref .  ) , we used the quantum monte carlo simulations for investigation of asymmetric ladders .",
    "we demonstrated a non - zero value of string order parameter for the whole family of such ladders , which confirmed that the system is in a haldane phase .",
    "we also presented numerical evidence for the smaller energy scale , @xmath21 , associated with suhl - nakamura interaction ( see below ) .",
    "numerical results for the spin gap were also judged compatible as vanishing as @xmath21 , even though a faster decay could not be ruled out .",
    "these results were consistent with the flow equation calculations of essler and coworkers @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we show , that the spin gap changes its behavior at small @xmath22 from @xmath6 in the symmetrical ladder case to @xmath23 in the single - pole ladder case . alternatively , we may think about rungs with a fixed exchange coupling @xmath3 , while the leg exchange increases gradually .",
    "we observe that the small-@xmath0 behavior @xmath24 is the same for all asymmetric ladders , but that important differences appear in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "the symmetrical ladder displays a saturation of the spin gap , @xmath6 , while the gap in the single - pole ladder reaches a maximum at @xmath26 and exhibits exponential suppression beyond that scale , according to the above formula .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we introduce the model and important definitions in section [ sec : setup ] , where we also provide simple qualitative considerations . particularly ,",
    "we explain here the importance of suhl - nakamura ( sn ) indirect exchange between dangling spins in the single - pole situation .",
    "we propose analytical approaches to our model in section [ sec : analytic ] . in section [ sec : blocks ] we develop a theory , incorporating spin - wave analysis , sn interaction and kadanoff s decimation procedure , which satisfactorily describes the whole body of numerical data presented below .",
    "we stress that several quantities are extracted from the numerical data and plotted specifically for comparison with the predictions of this effective theory .",
    "the unusual slow saturation of the spin gap value at large @xmath3 is discussed in section [ sec : app2 ] .    in section [ sec : numeric ]",
    "we describe the results of our extensive numerical investigations of the problem .",
    "section [ sec : exactdiag ] discusses exact diagonalization ( ed ) results .",
    "the appearance of a sn energy scale @xmath27 is shown here . given the long - range character of the sn interaction which require large systems to be appreciated , we resort to large scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations in the next subsection . with this approach",
    ", we investigate the form of the spin correlation functions in section [ sec : qmc ] , compute the spin gap in section [ sec : qmcgap ] as well as the string order parameter in section [ sec : sop ] , characteristic of the haldane phase .",
    "the most challenging case of the single - pole ladder gives rise to the largest uncertainties for the spin gap , and we focus on this system with the use of the dmrg method , as described in section [ sec : dmrg ] .",
    "the dmrg results do not give a principal advantage over qmc findings , but they provide a strong independent verification of the observed form of the spin gap , namely an exponential suppression at small @xmath3 .",
    "in appendix [ sec : meanfield ] , we analyze the qualitative changes in the spectra of symmetric and single - pole ladders within a jordan - wigner mean - field calculation . technicalities of spin - wave theory for long - range interaction are given in appendix [ sec : app1 ] .",
    "we finally present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we study the low - energy physics of the sshl system , characterized by the following hamiltonian : @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is a spin-@xmath13 operator acting on leg @xmath30 and lattice site @xmath31 and @xmath32 sets the energy scale .",
    "the single - pole ladder model @xcite corresponds to @xmath20 .",
    "it is convenient to reformulate the model  eq.([eq : sshl - hamilton1 ] ) in terms of new variables , @xmath33 defined on the rung .",
    "the hamiltonian then reads @xmath34 the set of operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 fully defines the @xmath37 algebra .",
    "@xcite    let us define the retarded spin response function in the ladder situation @xmath38 \\rangle ,   \\\\ & = \\int d \\omega '    \\frac{s_{jl}(q,\\omega')\\ ,   } { \\omega- \\omega'+{\\mathrm{i}}0 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 .",
    "at zero temperature the dynamic structure factor ( spectral weight ) , given by @xmath40 is represented as @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the ground state with the energy @xmath43 , the sum runs over all eigenstates @xmath44 of the hamiltonian with energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a fourier transform of @xmath47 .",
    "we also define the symmetrized combinations , @xmath48 which are response functions for operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 in ( [ eq : rungoperators ] ) , respectively .",
    "below we also use imaginary time correlation functions @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "let us now qualitatively discuss the situation . in the strong coupling region , @xmath53 , and for",
    "all possible twist angles @xmath17 triplets on the rungs become more and more favorable such that the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sshl - hamilton2 ] ) reduces to a pure spin-1 _ effective _ hamiltonian : @xmath54    in units of effective coupling @xmath55 ( and thus irrespective of the twist angle ) the spin gap of our model scales to the haldane gap @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite    in the weak coupling region the situation is more delicate and depends on the twist @xmath17 .",
    "let us discuss here the limiting cases .    for the symmetric ladder , @xmath19",
    ", the gap opens as @xmath6 , as obtained by bosonization and also qualitatively reproduced in the simplified mean - field picture below . for the fully asymmetric single - pole ladder @xmath20",
    "the mean - field calculation predicts a sub - linear behavior of the gap @xmath57 .",
    "the bosonization treatment becomes problematic in this case , as we can not apply the continuum approach to the chain of dangling spins attached to the main leg .",
    "the assumption of the finite fermi ( sound ) velocity in the subsystem breaks down and @xmath3 can not be used as a perturbation in the implicitly assumed hierarchy of scales @xmath58 .    instead ,",
    "we should start with the picture of a degenerate band of dangling spins , whose degeneracy is lifted by indirect exchange between these spins through the main leg .",
    "this phenomenon is known as a suhl - nakamura interaction @xcite for the case of a dilute system of extra spins in a magnetic host .",
    "it has a direct analogy with the rkky interaction where itinerant electrons mediate a long range spin - spin interactions between localized spins ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in second order perturbation theory the sn interaction reads : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the spin susceptibility of the spin-@xmath13 heisenberg chain .",
    "we thus arrive at a similar energy @xmath61 but now it stands for the sn - induced bandwidth , not for the spin gap .",
    "it is important to remark that both the mean - field treatment and the sn energy scale estimate provide us _ only _ with an upper bound for the gap value , @xmath61 .",
    "however this is likely a strong overestimation as quantum fluctuations , which are important in 1d , are not accounted for . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytic ] we present analytic arguments in favor of a gap vanishing faster than with a power law . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numeric ] we show , that the whole body of numerical data supports this scenario .",
    "in most cases , it is instructive to map the system of spins onto a system of 1d spinless fermions .",
    "we show in appendix [ sec : meanfield ] , that such jordan - wigner transformation and a subsequent mean - field theory analysis predict qualitative changes in the behavior of the gap with @xmath17 .",
    "particularly , eq .",
    "( [ gapmft ] ) there indicates that the prefactor in the linear law , @xmath6 , diminishes with decreasing @xmath62 , and that in the extreme case of single - pole ladder ( @xmath63 ) , the gap vanishes faster than @xmath64 .",
    "these observations are qualitatively confirmed by our numerical simulations . at the same time , the attempt to compare the mean - field results for the fermionic theory with the gap extracted from qmc data shows that the mean - field theory overestimates the gap by an order of magnitude .    in view of this fact , we perform a different type of analysis in the next subsections .      below we propose a scenario , which assumes different behavior of spin dynamics at high and low energies , as separated by the scale @xmath3 .",
    "this scenario is explicitly formulated for the single - pole ladder , which represents the most intriguing and difficult case , as seen in the numerics .",
    "the extension of this scenario to @xmath65 is also briefly discussed at the end of this subsection .",
    "the proposed theory allows to semi - quantitatively explain all features observed in the large - scale qmc and dmrg studies .    for the high energies in consideration @xmath66 ,",
    "the dangling spins should be considered as freely attached to the main chain .",
    "these energies correspond to short times , @xmath67 , and distances , @xmath68 .",
    "alternatively , one may think in terms of a higher temperature @xmath69 , which smears all fine features of the spectrum and leads to exponential decay of correlations beyond the temperature correlation length @xmath70 .",
    "the inverse length scale along the leg , @xmath71 , associated with the crossover to the low - energy dynamics is defined by the relation @xmath72 , showing that soft spinon excitations in the haf spin-1/2 chain , with momenta @xmath73 are strongly intertwined with triplet - singlet transitions on the rungs .    at these",
    "shorter time scales the classification in terms of singlet and triplet on the rung is not very appropriate .",
    "it means that the dangling spins are viewed as almost decoupled from the main chain : the situation is best described in terms of dangling spins coupled to each other by the suhl - nakamura interaction .",
    "the long - range character of sn interaction leads to an almost flat dispersion of the magnon excitations in the subsystem of dangling spins , the estimated sn energy scale not exceeding the crossover energy @xmath74 .    at smaller energies , @xmath75 , a picture of already formed triplets on the rungs",
    "is more appropriate .",
    "the discussion of the dynamics reduces to the rotations of the effective spins @xmath76 .",
    "further , these rung triplets are interlaced by the leg interaction into large effective spin blocks of size @xmath77 . despite a possibly large spatial size of the block ,",
    "the af character of the main leg interaction selects the smallest possible total spin state of this block . discarding the non - magnetic singlet , we focus on the block triplet state , i.e. , when @xmath77 spins @xmath76 are combined into a new effective spin @xmath76 of the block . as a result",
    ", we have a model with nearest - neighbors interaction between large blocks . such a model",
    "should display a haldane gap , whose value can be determined from usual arguments .",
    "let us start with the shorter distances and higher energies . in this case",
    "the sn interaction between dangling spins @xmath78 and @xmath79 has the form @xmath80 with    @xmath81    with @xmath82 is the response function for the haf @xmath15 model .",
    "@xcite for our purposes it suffices to approximate @xmath83 by @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85 singularity near @xmath86 shows that @xmath87 is sign - reversal and logarithmically decaying with distance , @xmath88 .",
    "the scale @xmath77 in the argument of the logarithm , appears here as a parameter which will be further determined by a self - consistency criterion .",
    "technically it is assumed that the allowed energies , @xmath89 , of the spin - wave continuum are restricted from below , @xmath90 .",
    "a chain of dangling spins , coupled by long - range sn interactions ( [ snint ] ) , behaves differently from the standard haf model with nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "a simple spin - wave analysis is then indispensable here .",
    "such an analysis can not give a correct form of correlation functions , but delivers a qualitative information about the spectrum .",
    "@xcite    using the formulas listed in appendix [ sec : app1 ] we conclude that the spin - wave spectrum in the system of dangling spins is given by the expression @xmath91 , with @xmath92 . approximating the range function @xmath93 we have @xmath94",
    "next we make the natural assumption that the top of the sn - induced band coincides ( at least by the order of magnitude ) with the logarithmic low energy cutoff introduced above , leading to @xmath95 or @xmath96    remarkably , this estimate shows that the low - energy spin - wave dispersion ( [ sn - magnons ] ) is characterized by the same velocity @xmath97 as the higher - energy excitations in the main leg .",
    "this is despite the fact that , strictly speaking , the low energies @xmath98 should be considered with a different approach as proposed below .",
    "notice that the described spectrum resembles a simple picture of hybridization between the linear spectrum and initially degenerate band at non - zero energy @xmath99 , with the crossing level repulsion phenomenon .    at small energies",
    "@xmath100 , we expect that the picture of spinons ( in the main leg ) scattering on the dangling spins , becomes inadequate .",
    "the dynamics of spins on the rung is characterized in terms of soft triplet dynamics , while the transitions to singlet state with the ( now ) large energy @xmath74 are discarded . on the same ground ,",
    "we discard spin - wave continuum excitations with energies @xmath101 , i.e. , the description now has changed from the individual sites along the leg to entire blocks of length @xmath77 .",
    "we may thus think in terms of the effective spin @xmath76 on the rung , and these individual spins @xmath76 are antiferromagnetically coupled to each other in the large block .",
    "furthermore , we can characterize the whole block @xmath77 of spins 1 by its lowest non - trivial multiplet , a spin 1 again .",
    "however now it is an object defined at a much larger spatial scale .",
    "the trivial low - energy multiplet in such @xmath77-block is a spin - singlet state , which obviously drops out from the soft spin dynamics .",
    "the typical energy spacing between the resulting spin - triplet of the @xmath77-block and the higher multiplets is estimated again as @xmath102 .",
    "we expect that this lowest triplet state is non - degenerate , i.e. other triplets are higher in energy .",
    "below we refer to this lowest triplet state as @xmath77-triplet .",
    "we note in passing that the estimate @xmath103 follows also from the argument presented in ref .  .",
    "it was suggested there that the spinons , propagating along the main leg by distance @xmath104 and characterized by a typical energy @xmath0 , break the pre - formed rung triplets resulting in an energy cost @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting confining potential should , in principle , restrict the motion of spinons to distances @xmath106 .",
    "our way of constructing @xmath77-triplet resembles kadanoff s decimation procedure in the description of critical phenomena .",
    "@xcite the new lattice of large blocks contains spins 1 , which are denoted below by @xmath107 ( here @xmath108 numbers a position in a new lattice ) and are coupled to each other by a nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "in fact , only the edge spins of each @xmath77 block are responsible for this interaction . adopting the notation that the weight of these edge spins in the @xmath77-triplet is @xmath109 at @xmath110 ( see below ) , we write explicitly for odd @xmath77 @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 stands for the floor function .",
    "similarly , @xmath114 .",
    "the phase @xmath115 accounts for the af character of the contributing spins in the @xmath77-block and the additional phase shift @xmath116 is introduced to restore the translational invariance in the blocks picture .",
    "the definition of the above weight @xmath117 is as follows .",
    "assume that the lowest multiplet in the @xmath77-block is a triplet @xmath118 , spanned by the spin-1 operators @xmath119 .",
    "then , up to a sign , the edge operators of the block act as @xmath120 and similarly for the weight @xmath121 of @xmath122 .",
    "the block hamiltonian on the decimated lattice reads @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "this model should exhibit a haldane gap , but the value of this gap is strongly diminished .    employing a standard albeit simplified approach used in the original haldane paper ,",
    "we apply the linearized spin - wave theory outlined in appendix [ sec : app1 ] and obtain the magnon dispersion , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the wave vector on the decimated lattice @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "it implies that the velocity of the lowest - lying excitations with respect to the real lattice is given by @xmath129 . with the plausible assumption that this low - energy estimate coincides with the high - energy one , we obtain @xmath130 and hence @xmath131 .",
    "notice that it corresponds to a bandwidth @xmath132 , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ sn - magnons ] ) .",
    "we require that the zero - point magnon fluctuations cancel the local magnetization in the usual formula @xmath133 , i.e. , we write @xmath134 . for the relevant low - lying modes , we have @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is magnon creation operator in the @xmath108th @xmath77-triplet .",
    "we then obtain the relation    @xmath137 where we introduced the cutoff wave - vector @xmath138 , related to the haldane gap @xmath139 .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath140 and    @xmath141    let us discuss the decay of correlations at the distances @xmath142 ; we take @xmath143 integer for simplicity .",
    "we have @xmath144    the above assumption that @xmath131 leads to the following final formulas @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "our scenario also suggests that the long - range behavior of correlations ( [ eq : final ] ) takes place for both main leg and dangling spins at distances @xmath147 .",
    "comparing the above formulas ( [ eq : final ] ) to our numerical findings below , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qmccorrelations ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : scales ] , we verify that , indeed , @xmath148 .",
    "finally , let us briefly comment on the situation where there is a weak exchange along the second leg , @xmath149 and @xmath150 . repeating the steps of the analysis leading to eq .",
    "( [ sn - magnons ] ) , we observe that the sn induced band appears on the background of usual exchange .",
    "roughly , one can write @xmath151 and the bandwidth is estimated as @xmath152 .",

    "the above scenario remains valid , as long as @xmath155 , which imposes restrictions on @xmath17 .",

    "[ fig : qmcgap]a , that the gap at @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) behaves qualitatively similar to the one at @xmath158 , whereas the behavior of the gap at @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) is apparently different and closer to the one of the symmetric ladder , @xmath161 . for our semi - quantitative level of consideration",
