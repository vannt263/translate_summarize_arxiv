    "perturbation theory is a venerable field of study in general relativity ( gr ) . in fact , because of the complexity of the einstein field equation ( efe ) , most physically relevant analytical results in gr rely on perturbing away from a known solution .",
    "however , most of the foundational work in this area has focused only on descriptions of regular perturbation problems  problems in which a regular power - series expansion yields a uniform asymptotic approximation to a true solution .",
    "the underlying formalism of regular perturbation theory in gr has been studied extensively @xcite , and it has been shown that any regular asymptotic expansion of the field equations yields a perturbative solution that approximates at least one exact solution , at least locally @xcite .",
    "however , many physically interesting systems must be modeled as _ singular _ perturbation problems  problems in which a regular power - series expansion fails to provide a uniform asymptotic approximation . indeed ,",
    "one of the most successful areas of research in gr , post - newtonian theory , centers on a singular perturbation problem .",
    "as one would expect , the foundations of that particular problem have been studied extensively @xcite , and it is now known that there exist a large class of exact solutions possessing post - newtonian expansions @xcite .",
    "but general discussions of singular perturbation theory in gr are lacking ; kates has provided the only such discussion  @xcite , and his emphasis was on providing an overview of the geometrical structure of singular problems , foregoing any discussion of particular methods .",
    "along with the post - newtonian expansion , another problem of great significance is also singular : the motion of an asymptotically small body through an external spacetime .",
    "this problem will be the primary focus of the present paper .",
    "study of the point particle limit is less well developed than that of the newtonian limit , and it has typically focused on proving that at leading order , a small , uncharged body behaves as a test mass , moving on a geodesic of the external background spacetime ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , in recent years , the advent of gravitational wave astronomy has enjoined a need to go beyond the test particle approximation .",
    "specifically , more accurate approximations are required to model extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) , in which a compact body ( such as a neutron star or black hole ) of mass @xmath0 spirals into a supermassive kerr black hole of mass @xmath1 lying at the center of a galaxy ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview of these systems .",
    "extreme mass - ratio inspirals are a potentially important source of wave - signals for the planned gravitational - wave detector lisa @xcite , with a predicted rate of several to one hundred detectable events per year @xcite .    for an emri ,",
    "an expansion in the point particle limit roughly corresponds to an expansion in powers of the mass ratio @xmath2 .",
    "( for the remainder of this paper , i assume all variables have been scaled by a global lengthscale such as @xmath3 , such that i can write , e.g. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is dimensionless . ) at leading order in a regular expansion , the small body behaves as a point particle and moves on a geodesic of the spacetime of the large body . at sub - leading order , the metric perturbation generated by",
    "the body exerts a force on it , the dissipative part of which causes it to very slowly spiral into the large body .",
    "the acceleration of this inspiraling worldline , caused by the body s interaction with its own gravitational field , is called the gravitational self - force .",
    "a general , analytical expression for the self - force in an arbitrary vacuum background spacetime was first derived by mino , sasaki , and tanaka @xcite and quinn and wald @xcite ; that expression is now known as the misataquwa equation .",
    "this is a singular perturbation problem for two reasons .",
    "first , near the body , the first - order metric perturbation is that of a point particle , behaving as a delta function with support on the particle s worldline . if the body is anything other than a black hole , the error in the approximation ( i.e. , the difference between the exact and approximate metrics ) will then be unbounded in a small neighborhood of the body ; and even in the case of a black hole , the expansion will fail , since the second - order einstein tensor will contain products of delta functions and hence be ill - defined as a distribution .",
    "therefore , the approximation breaks down due to rapid changes , on the lengthscale @xmath6 , near the body .",
    "the second reason the problem is singular is the existence of secular errors ( i.e. , ones that accumulate over time ) .",
    "if we use the first - order solution with a point particle source , then the bianchi identity constrains the particle to move on a geodesic ; at higher order in the expansion , this geodesic worldline is corrected by small deviation vectors @xcite .",
    "but the true path of the small body spirals into the large black hole , eventually deviating by a very large amount from the leading - order , geodesic worldline ; generically , the error in the regular expansion will be unbounded on any time - interval @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the approximation also breaks down due to slow , cumulative changes over the radiation - reaction timescale @xmath9 .",
    "( in an emri , this is the time required for the particle s energy and angular momentum to undergo an order-@xmath10 change , since their rate of change is proportional to the self - force , itself of order @xmath5 . )    in singular perturbation theory , in order to overcome these types of errors , one makes use of _ general expansions _ , of the form",
    "@xmath11 unlike a regular power - series expansion , here the coefficients @xmath12 are allowed to depend on @xmath5 ; but they are nevertheless constrained to be of order 1 , in the sense that there exist positive constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for @xmath16 , but @xmath17 ( unless @xmath12 is identically zero ) . put simply , the goal of a general expansion is to expand only _ part _ of a function s @xmath5-dependence , while holding fixed some specific @xmath5-dependence that captures one or more of the function s essential features .",
    "there are two common types of general expansions : _ composite expansions _ and _ multiscale expansions_. the first of these is designed to overcome the failure of a regular expansion near some submanifold ( such as the position of the small body in an emri ) , while the second is designed to overcome secular errors ( such as the deviation of the true motion from the leading - order , geodesic approximation ) .",
    "composite expansions are patched together from a finite number of regular expansions .",
    "for example , in the emri problem , if we use a rescaled radial coordinate @xmath18 near the body , then a regular expansion at fixed @xmath19 could be accurate on the scale @xmath20 , where an expansion at fixed @xmath21 fails ; this _ inner expansion _ can then be combined with an _ outer expansion _",
    "valid for @xmath22 , yielding a composite expansion that is uniformly accurate both near and far from the body .",
    "i will refer to a pair of inner and outer expansions such as this as _",
    "dual expansions_. one can make use of dual expansions in a variety of ways , but historically , they have been used most often in the method of matched asymptotic expansions , in which the two expansions are first partially determined in their respective domains of validity , and then any remaining freedom in them is removed by insisting that they agree in a domain of mutual validity .",
    "they were first used in fluid dynamics to analyze the behavior of a low - viscosity fluid near a boundary . in the context of gr , since the pioneering work of burke  @xcite , who studied the effect of radiation - reaction on a post - newtonian binary , and death  @xcite , who studied the motion of black holes , dual expansions have mostly been utilized for two purposes : determining waveforms by matching wave - zone expansions to near - zone expansions ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) , and determining equations of motion for small bodies by matching an inner expansion near a body to an outer expansion in a larger region ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the latter method , in various forms , has often been used to derive the misataquwa equation @xcite .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more thorough review . )",
    "composite expansions are suitable only when the different lengthscales dominate in different regions ",
    ", the metric varies on the short lengthscale @xmath6 near the small body , while it varies on the background lengthscale @xmath23 everywhere else .",
    "in contrast , multiscale expansions are suitable in situations where multiple lengthscales are relevant everywhere in the region of interest .",
    "these expansions begin directly with the generalized form , where the coefficients @xmath24 depend on some specific function of @xmath5for example , in a two - timescale expansion , @xmath25 is assumed to depend on a time coordinate @xmath26 and a _ slow - time _ coordinate @xmath27 , which allows the expansion to capture both short - term and long - term effects .",
    "recently , hinderer and flanagan @xcite have suggested a two - timescale expansion of the efe and equation of motion in the emri problem ; the method has also been applied to more restricted expansions of self - forced equations of motion @xcite .",
    "in addition to these standard expansions , there has been one further general expansion utilized in the self - force problem : a self - consistent expansion with a fixed worldline . in this expansion , rather than allowing a functional dependence on an @xmath5-dependent function from spacetime to @xmath28 , such as a slow - time coordinate ,",
    "one allows a functional dependence on a function from @xmath28 _ to _ spacetime .",
    "this allows one to consider a metric perturbation that is a functional of an exact , @xmath5-dependent worldline , bypassing the constraint that the worldline must be a geodesic at leading order .",
    "this idea underlies the methods of post - newtonian theory , and it has been assumed in some form in much of the literature on the self - force , including in the earliest derivations of the misataquwa equation @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach was first formalized in terms of a systematic approximation scheme . that scheme makes use of two general expansions : an inner expansion accurate near the small body , and an outer expansion accurate in the external background spacetime . in the outer expansion ,",
    "the metric is treated as a functional of the exact worldline @xmath29 , and it is then expanded while holding that dependence fixed : @xmath30+{\\varepsilon}^2{h^{(2)}_{}}[\\gamma]+ ... $ ] .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details . like a two - timescale expansion",
    ", this fixed - worldline approach promises to eliminate the secular errors of a regular expansion ; however , the precise relationship between the two methods remains to be explored .    in this paper ,",
    "i seek to accomplish two goals .",
    "my first goal is to extend the geometrical description of singular perturbation techniques . the geometrical picture of regular perturbation theory in gr is well known ; the analogous description of singular perturbation theory , provided by kates @xcite , is less well known . in sec .",
    "[ perturbations_in_gr ] , i review kates work and then go beyond it by describing in some detail the three techniques used in the self - force problem : dual expansions , multiscale expansions , and the self - consistent expansion presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "i focus on making precise statements pertaining to these methods , with the aim of clarifying previous work .",
    "with regard to dual expansions , i identify two matching conditions that may be used in the method of matched asymptotic expansions  a strong matching condition analogous to the one used in traditional singular perturbation theory , and a weak matching condition that arises when working in multiple coordinate systems . with regard to multiscale expansions",
    ", i provide a covariant description . with regard to the self - consistent expansion ,",
    "i extend the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite by providing an exact formulation of the self - force problem and a brief discussion of the gauge freedom in the expansion .",
    "my second goal is to provide a precise formulation of the derivations of the gravitational self - force using matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "section  [ matching ] consists of a new version of this derivation , along with detailed analysis and discussion .",
    "matching was used in some of the earliest derivations of the misataquwa equation @xcite . because it can determine the first - order equation of motion from a first - order outer expansion , it is technically far less involved than the method of refs .",
    "@xcite , which determine the @xmath31th - order equation of motion by solving the field equations to @xmath32st order in a region around the body .",
    "however , as i will discuss , the method as it has been utilized in the self - force problem has relied on the weak matching condition , which is too weak to actually determine an equation of motion . in order to determine an equation of motion",
    ", additional assumptions must be made .",
    "i pinpoint these assumptions and formulate a refined matching condition .",
    "because of the variety of assumptions required , i conclude that matching yields weaker results than one would expect from traditional singular perturbation theory ; and it yields weaker results than those obtainable through the more laborious approach of refs .",
    "the method can surely be improved , the number of assumptions reduced , but such improvement may prove more difficult than using alternative methods .    before proceeding to these two goals ,",
    "i begin in sec .",
    "[ traditional ] with a review of traditional singular perturbation methods in applied mathematics .",
    "such a review is warranted both to develop the concepts required in the later sections and to make the basics of the theory more widely known .",
    "more detailed overviews of the subject can be found in numerous textbooks ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . among these",
    ", the text by kevorkian and cole @xcite covers the broadest range of topics , and the text by eckhaus @xcite provides the most rigorous treatment .",
    "i begin by defining some useful notation .",
    "first , i define the following order symbols : for @xmath33 ,    * @xmath34 if there exist positive constants @xmath13 and @xmath35 such that @xmath36 for fixed @xmath37 and @xmath38 . *",
    "@xmath39 if @xmath40 at fixed @xmath37 .",
    "* @xmath41 if @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for example , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .    in general , we are concerned with the asymptotic behavior of functions , rather than the behavior of functions evaluated at particular locations .",
    "this means we need a norm appropriate for a function .",
    "also , a central issue in perturbation theory is whether or not an approximation is uniformly accurate in a region of interest , where uniformity is defined as follows :    * @xmath34 _ uniformly _ in a region @xmath47 if there exist positive constants @xmath13 and @xmath35 such that @xmath48 for @xmath38 , where @xmath49 .",
    "analogous definitions hold for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these definitions provide a more useful measure of the asymptotic behavior of a function .",
    "finally , i define several important asymptotic quantities : relative to an asymptotic sequence @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ,    * @xmath54 is an @xmath55th - order _ asymptotic approximation _ of @xmath56 if @xmath57 , , functions would be rescaled by @xmath58 before making comparisons . ]",
    "* @xmath54 is an @xmath55th - order _ asymptotic solution _ to a differential equation @xmath59=0 $ ] if @xmath60=o(\\zeta_n({\\varepsilon}))$ ] , * @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , is an @xmath55th - order _ asymptotic series_. if @xmath63 is independent of @xmath5 , then the series is said to be _ regular _ ( sometimes called poincar - type ) ; if not , then it is _",
    "general_. if , in addition , @xmath64 is an asymptotic approximation to @xmath65 , then it is an @xmath55th - order _ asymptotic expansion _ of @xmath65 .",
    "the most common asymptotic sequence is @xmath66 , which i will use almost exclusively in this paper .",
    "note that we are typically uninterested in whether or not an asymptotic series converges as @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , even if @xmath64 is an asymptotic series that both converges and asymptotically approximates @xmath65 , the function that it converges to might not be @xmath65 .    in any given perturbation calculation ,",
    "one almost always calculates an asymptotic solution to an equation . determining whether or not an asymptotic solution is also an asymptotic approximation to an exact solution is typically far more difficult .",
    "it is , however an essential step in proving the reliability of an expansion , because an asymptotic solution may not be an asymptotic approximation to an exact solution ( more pathologically , an asymptotic approximation may not be an asymptotic solution @xcite ) .",
    "general asymptotic expansions are a powerful tool for solving singular perturbation problems , which are defined by the failure of a regular expansion to provide a uniform approximation .",
    "this failure is often signaled by a change of character in the governing differential equation when @xmath68 : for example , a hyperbolic equation might degenerate into a parabolic equation .",
    "the inaccuracy of a regular expansion is also frequently signaled by its failure to satisfy a given boundary condition , or by the expansion growing without bound in a system that we have reason to believe should be bounded .",
    "typically , the underlying origin of the failure is the presence of distinct length scales , one of which appears only for @xmath69 .",
    "often , this means that the exact solution to a problem is singular at @xmath70 .",
    "hence , in singular perturbation problems , we assume that @xmath71 $ ] , which allows us to take the limit @xmath72 , but which prevents us from setting @xmath70 . in this section ,",
    "i consider two types of systems : first , systems in which the exact solution undergoes a rapid change near a submanifold ; second , systems in which rapid changes occur throughout the region of interest . in the first type of system , dual expansions can be used to construct a uniform general expansion ; in the second type , a multiscale expansion can be used .    before",
    "proceeding , i define two final pieces of notation . @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote , respectively , the push - forward and pull - back corresponding to a map @xmath75 .",
    "so , for example , if @xmath64 is a function of coordinates @xmath37 , and @xmath76 , then @xmath77 is the function rewritten in terms of @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 denotes the @xmath55th - order regular asymptotic expansion of @xmath65 in the limit of small @xmath5 , holding fixed the coordinates of which @xmath65 is a function .",
    "dual expansions are typically used to solve boundary value problems in which the solution exhibits rapid change in a very small region ( or a finite number of such regions ) .",
    "the regions of rapid change are referred to as boundary layers .",
    "frequently , this rapid change prevents a regular expansion from satisfying a given boundary condition , though a  boundary layer \" can sometimes arise away from any boundary .",
    "the usual means of solving these problems is to make use of two regular expansions : an inner expansion @xmath80 that is expected to be valid in the boundary layer , and an outer expansion @xmath81 that is expected to be valid outside of it .",
    "suppose we have a one - dimensional problem with coordinate @xmath21 , and that the boundary layer is at @xmath82 and has a thickness @xmath83 .",
    "then the outer expansion is simply a regular series at fixed @xmath21 , and the inner expansion is a regular series at fixed values of the rescaled coordinate @xmath84 ; this can be written as @xmath85 .",
    "the inner expansion allows us to capture changes over the lengthscale @xmath86 , since @xmath19 is of order unity when the original coordinate @xmath21 is of order @xmath86 .",
    "note that if we treat the problem on a two - dimensional plane with coordinates @xmath87 , then the inner and outer expansions can be visualized as expansions along flow lines defined by @xmath88constant and @xmath89constant , as shown in fig .",

    "this leaves each of the expansions underdetermined .",
    "the basic idea of dual expansions is to fully determine them by insisting that they agree in some region of mutual validity .",
    "suppose that @xmath97 is an @xmath55th - order asymptotic approximation of @xmath65 in a region @xmath98 , and @xmath81 is an @xmath55th - order asymptotic approximation in a region @xmath99 . then by definition , @xmath100 in @xmath98 and @xmath101 in @xmath102 .",
    "subtracting the second equation from the first , we have the _ overlap matching condition _ : @xmath103    note that this condition relies on the existence of the _ overlap region _",
    "@xmath104 . if that region is empty , then the condition is vacuous . and it may not be obvious that such a region ever exists , since the inner expansion trivially appears to be valid only for @xmath105 , and the outer expansion only for @xmath22 . however , if @xmath106 is a uniform asymptotic approximation to @xmath107 on an interval @xmath108 $ ] for constant @xmath109 , then it is also a uniform approximation on the extended interval @xmath110 $ ] for some @xmath111 ; similarly , if @xmath112 is a uniform approximation to @xmath113 on @xmath114 $ ] , then it is a uniform approximation on the extended interval @xmath115 $ ] for some @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "if we have access to the exact function @xmath65 , then we can explicitly determine the overlap of these extended regions .",
    "but in a typical application , without access to an exact solution , we must make use of the _ overlap hypothesis _ , which states that the overlap region exists . in order to implement the overlap matching condition",
    ", one then simply assumes that the constructed asymptotic series of a given order are asymptotic approximations of the same order , and one then takes the overlap region to be the region in which @xmath117 .    in this paper , i will not make direct use of the overlap matching condition .",
    "instead , i will use a second , simpler matching condition , which i will refer to as the _ coefficient - matching condition _ : @xmath118 in this matching condition , we match results term - by - term in the expansions . on the left - hand side",
    "we have the inner expansion ( @xmath119 ) written as a function of @xmath21 ( via @xmath74 ) and then expanded in the outer limit ; on the right - hand side , we have the outer expansion ( @xmath120 ) written as a function of @xmath19 ( via @xmath73 ) and expanded in the inner limit , and then rewritten as a function of @xmath21 and re - expanded .",

    "we can write this schematically as @xmath121 meaning that when the inner expansion is re - expanded for small @xmath5 at fixed @xmath21 , and the outer expansion is re - expanded for small @xmath21 at fixed @xmath5 , the two results must agree term by term .",
    "we can then , for example , equate coefficients of @xmath122 on the left- and right - hand sides .",
    "if we define the _ buffer region _ by the inequalities @xmath123 , this equation states that the inner and outer expansions must agree term by term when they are both expanded in the buffer region .",
    "in other words , if the exact solution is expanded first for small @xmath5 at fixed @xmath124 ( yielding an inner expansion ) , and then expanded at fixed @xmath21 ( or in other words , for @xmath125 ) , it must agree , term by term , with the result of expanding first for small @xmath5 at fixed @xmath21 and then expanding for @xmath126 .    from the perspective of the inner limit ,",
    "the buffer region lies at asymptotic infinity ( @xmath92 ) ; from the perspective of the outer expansion , it lies asymptotically close to @xmath95 . from this",
    "we can intuit a still simpler matching condition , which i will call the _ asymptotic matching condition _ : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the leading - order terms in , respectively , the inner and outer expansions .",
    "the three matching conditions i have discussed are obviously related .",
    "in fact , one can derive the asymptotic matching condition and ( a condition similar to ) the coefficient - matching condition from the overlap hypothesis .",
    "however , one should realize that the overlap hypothesis is merely sufficient to arrive at those two matching conditions : it is not necessary .",
    "functions exist that do not satisfy the overlap hypothesis but nevertheless satisfy the coefficient - matching condition , for example @xcite .",
    "once a matching condition has been used to fully determine the inner and outer expansions , one can construct a _ composite expansion _ that is uniformly accurate on the full domain of the problem .",

    "hence , i take the model manifold in the outer expansion to be @xmath228 , and i take the external background metric to be @xmath229 . of course , this construction is not essential ; the model manifold need not be defined by setting @xmath70 in this way .",

    "these two identification maps induce a map @xmath245 , given by @xmath246 , which has the identical coordinate description as the original transformation @xmath247 between the global and local coordinates .",
    "gauge transformations in the outer and inner expansions are generated by vector fields @xmath248 and @xmath249 , which take their respective values in the tangent bundles of @xmath234 and @xmath238 .",
    "note that a gauge transformation in the outer expansion generically corresponds to a finite coordinate transformation in the inner expansion , due to the rescaling of the coordinates .",
    "a uniform composite expansion is formed on a model manifold @xmath250 by cutting out a portion of @xmath234 and stitching part of @xmath238 into the excised region .",
    "the local and global coordinates each cover a patch of @xmath251 , identified with the patches @xmath222 and @xmath223 on @xmath178 via the maps @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the uniform metric is constructed on this manifold by adding together the inner and outer approximations in each coordinate system , then removing any `` double - counted '' terms that appear in both metrics .",
    "how would one go about constructing such a uniform approximation if one did not have access to an exact solution ? just as in traditional perturbation theory , one would construct two separate asymptotic solutions to einstein s equation , but now in possibly two different coordinate systems and on possibly two different manifolds . if one assumes that the two asymptotic solutions are approximations of a single exact solution , and if there exists an overlap region on the manifold @xmath251 in which both approximations are valid to the same order , then they must agree in that overlap region . in this case ,  agreement \" is defined by the existence of the unique map @xmath144 that relates the two expansions . as usual , we will not worry about a specific overlap region , but instead expand the two solutions in the buffer region .",
    "however , before performing that expansion in the buffer region , one must write @xmath252 and @xmath253 in the same coordinate system .",
    "let us choose this system to be the local coordinates @xmath254 . then , adapting eq .  , the matching condition reads @xmath255 on the left , we begin with the exact metric in the local coordinates @xmath254 .",
    "it is then expanded to @xmath256th - order in an inner expansion , by transforming into scaled coordinates @xmath257 via @xmath75 ( along with an appropriate conformal rescaling ) and expanding .",
    "next , it is expanded in the buffer region by re - expressing it in the unscaled local coordinates and expanding to @xmath13th order ; this is equivalent to an expansion of the inner solution for @xmath258 . on the right - hand side of the equation ,",
    "we begin with the exact metric in the global coordinates @xmath206 .",
    "it is expanded to @xmath256th order in those coordinates , yielding an outer expansion .",
    "it is then transformed to the starting point of the left - hand side , by transforming to the local coordinates via @xmath144 , then to the scaled local coordinates via @xmath75 , then re - expanding to @xmath256th order to yield an inner expansion .",
    "finally , it is expanded in the buffer region by transforming back to the unscaled local coordinates and re - expanding .",
    "the content of this equation is that the expansion in the buffer region must be the same whether it is obtained by first performing an outer expansion or by first performing an inner expansion .",
    "schematically , we can write @xmath259 which states that if the inner and outer expansions are written in the same coordinate system , then they must yield the same expansion in the buffer region .",
    "but this is decidedly _ not _ the matching condition that has been used in practice .",
    "instead , what has been done in practice is the reverse : first , expand the two solutions in the buffer region , and only afterward find the coordinate transformation between them .",
    "this is accomplished by setting up a second local coordinate system @xmath260 centered on a worldline @xmath29 in @xmath234 ; for example , these might be fermi normal coordinates , and in the case of regular expansions , they would be centered on @xmath227 .",
    "the outer expansion is then written in these local coordinates and expanded for small @xmath21 , under the presumption that @xmath261 . after performing this expansion ( and the expansion of @xmath252 in the buffer region ) ,",
    "one seeks a unique transformation @xmath262 that maps the buffer - region expansion of @xmath253 into the buffer - region expansion of @xmath252 .. ] schematically , we can write @xmath263 on the left , the inner expansion @xmath252 is expanded in the buffer region in the local unscaled coordinates @xmath254 . on the right ,",
    "the outer expansion @xmath253 is transformed to the local coordinates @xmath264 via @xmath265 , then it is expanded in the buffer region ( i.e. , for small @xmath21 ) . hence , the two buffer - region expansions are written in two different coordinate systems : the inner expansion in the coordinates @xmath254 , and the outer expansion in the coordinates @xmath264 .",
    "so , in order to make a comparison , as the final step on the right - hand side , the buffer - region expansion of @xmath253 is transformed to the coordinates @xmath254 via @xmath266 . in short , eq .",
    "states that if @xmath252 and @xmath253 are expanded in the buffer region , then the resulting expansions must be related by a coordinate transformation .",
    "i will call eq .",
    "the _ strong matching condition _ and eq .",
    "the _ weak matching condition_. the weak condition follows from the strong condition , but not vice versa , and one can easily imagine situations in which the weak condition would be satisfied while the strong condition would not . in the weak matching condition , because the metric is already expanded for small @xmath21 before @xmath267 is determined , @xmath267 will itself be written as an expansion .",
    "thus , the weak matching condition only requires an asymptotic approximation of @xmath267 ( or , equivalently , of @xmath268 ) . of course , one can only ever determine an asymptotic approximation  but in the strong matching condition , the approximation is for small @xmath5 , rather than for both small @xmath5 and small @xmath21 .",
    "this essentially reduces @xmath267 to a gauge transformation in the buffer - region expansion defined by @xmath269 ( or @xmath21 ) and @xmath5 both being small .",
    "as mentioned above , a gauge transformation in the outer expansion corresponds to a finite coordinate transformation in the inner expansion , and vice versa .",
    "hence , any choice of gauge on @xmath234 must be compatible with the choice of background coordinates on @xmath238 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the two matching conditions insist on this compatibility to differing extents .",
    "one should note that though the description in this section makes use of two regular expansions , as in traditional matched asymptotic expansions , the same general description holds for two general expansions .",
    "the only differences are that @xmath270 and that there is no need to conformally scale the metric to arrive at the inner expansion .",
    "this is particularly important if one wishes to allow the internal metric to vary on its  natural \" timescale @xmath271 ( i.e. , the timescale determined by the mass of the small object ) .",
    "if the metric near the body varies on this timescale , then in the unscaled coordinate time @xmath272 , the metric will have a functional dependence on the combination @xmath273 , which will be singular in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "thus , if both the expansions are to be regular , the internal metric can vary only on the external time @xmath274 , corresponding to an internal slow evolution depending only on @xmath275 .",
    "in other words , regularity requires that the internal solution varies quasistatically ( see death s discussion  @xcite ) . of course",
    ", for @xmath69 , one could construct a general inner expansion that is identical to the regular inner expansion by rescaling @xmath269 only , instead of both @xmath274 and @xmath269 , and then simply assuming the inner expansion varies quasistatically ; using this method , a global - in - time expansion can be constructed , and the metric is never conformally rescaled . also ,",
    "by using this method , one can remove the quasistatic assumption entirely .    finally , before moving to the next singular perturbation technique",
    ", i will note that just as in traditional singular perturbation theory , there is a distinction between what i have called the overlap region and the buffer region .",
    "the buffer region corresponds simply to @xmath276 . in order for us to express the outer solution in terms of the field @xmath269",
    ", the buffer region must lie within the region @xmath47 , where both the local and global coordinate systems apply , but the size of the region is independent of the order of accuracy of the inner and outer solutions . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , one can extract considerable information about the metric  and in particular , equations of motion for the small body  by working entirely within the buffer region , without ever constructing explicit inner and outer solutions or making use of an overlap hypothesis .",
    "this information is typically extracted by defining the mass and current moments of the body in the buffer region , which is possible because the buffer region lies at asymptotic infinity from the perspective of the inner expansion . solving the einstein equation",
    "then determines the evolution of these moments .",
    "in particular , an evolution equation for the body s mass dipole informs us of the motion of the body s center of mass relative to the chosen local coordinate system , providing an equation of motion for the body .      in the method of multiple scales ,",
    "changes on both short and fast time scales occur throughout the spacetime .",
    "thus , one can not construct a uniform asymptotic approximation based on combining only two limit processes .",
    "if we consider a two - timescale expansion , with a fast time @xmath26 and a slow time @xmath147 , there are only two limits that can be easily envisioned : the slow - time limit @xmath72 at fixed @xmath145 , which follows a congruence of curves in @xmath174 that tend toward @xmath277 as @xmath72 ; or the fast - time limit @xmath72 at fixed @xmath26 , which follows a congruence of curves that tend toward @xmath278 . however , in a multiscale expansion , both quantities are to be kept fixed .",
    "as discussed above , this is accomplished by treating them as independent variables .",
    "consider the case of an expansion that holds fixed both a set of coordinates @xmath206 and some scalar field @xmath279 satisfying @xmath280 : @xmath281 in the simplest case , @xmath282 is equal to the product of @xmath5 and one of the coordinates .",
    "when substituting this multiscale expansion into einstein s equation , one would treat @xmath282 and @xmath206 as independent coordinates on an extended , 5d manifold @xmath283 ; these 5d manifolds are stacked atop one another to form a 6d manifold @xmath284 .",
    "the limit @xmath72 is taken at fixed values of both @xmath282 and @xmath37 , and the actual solution is obtained by restricting the expansion to the submanifold defined by @xmath285 .    as in traditional perturbation theory , one might require a fast - time variable @xmath144 that differs from the given coordinate time .",
    "indeed , one might use any coordinates one likes on @xmath283 . to provide some flavor of the expansions , in this section",

    "the form of the outer metric is that of a known background written in fermi coordinates centered on a possibly accelerated worldline .",
    "regardless of the value of the acceleration , if the geodesic is embedded in the external spacetime , then these two solutions are obviously related by a diffeomorphism , since the geodesic can be transformed to the accelerated worldline .",

    "however , one might wonder if this ambiguity might be removed by supplementing the weak matching condition with some other condition .",
    "one such condition appears obvious : the coordinate transformation between the inner and outer expansions in the buffer region must be  small \" that is , it must vanish in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "this removes the possibility of transforming from an arbitrary geodesic to an arbitrarily - accelerated worldline . in the buffer region , @xmath502 as @xmath68 , so this allows transformations that have no explicit @xmath5-dependence , but which do have explicit @xmath21-dependence .",
    "i trust the reader to convince himself that under such a transformation , we must have @xmath503 , @xmath498 , the tidal fields appearing in the inner metric must be identical ( up to @xmath504 corrections ) to those constructed from the riemann tensor in the outer solution  and the leading - order term in the acceleration must vanish : @xmath505 . the two coordinate systems may , of course , be related by rotations , but these are insignificant .    hence , we can adopt a stronger , refined matching condition : the inner and outer expansions in the buffer region must be equal up to a unique small coordinate transformation . unfortunately , this refined condition is still insufficient .",
    "the reason is that the inner expansion _ could _ have included acceleration - type terms .",
    "in fact , we can always include such terms by transforming the metric into an accelerating frame .",
    "suppose we begin with the schwarzschild metric in kerr - schild form , @xmath506 where @xmath507 is the minkowski metric , @xmath508 is a null vector , @xmath509 , and the ( unscaled ) coordinates are @xmath510 .",

    "therefore , if we transform the metric to fermi - type coordinates @xmath493 , we arrive at @xmath524 this metric agrees with the one in the outer expansion , regardless of the value of the acceleration .",
    "we may identify @xmath525 with @xmath526 , and the matching procedure , even with the refined matching condition , provides no information whatsoever about the worldline .",
    "we can readily see why the matching procedure has failed : we have not insisted on any relationship between the inner and outer expansions . in order for matching to be successful , we must insist that the  position \" of the black hole in the inner expansion can be identified with the position of the worldline in the outer expansion . to make this identification mathematically precise",
    ", i insist that the two expansions are to be expanded and matched in the buffer region only when the outer expansion is evaluated in a coordinate system centered on the worldline and the inner expansion is evaluated in a mass - centered coordinate system . if this condition is imposed , then the accelerating coordinate system @xmath527 is inadmissible , since it is not mass - centered . therefore , we can discount it and others like it  and we can once again , now more confidently , conclude that the acceleration of the worldline must vanish in the limit @xmath68 . such a condition serves to implicitly define the worldline , and it is necessary for the matching procedure to be well - defined and to yield unambiguous results .",
    "based on the above analysis of the zeroth - order matching procedure , i suggest the following matching condition : if the inner expansion is written in a mass - centered coordinate system and the outer expansion is written in a worldline - centered coordinate system , then the two expansions must be equal up to a small coordinate transformation when expanded in the limit of small ( outer ) radial coordinate distances .",

    "also , the inner metric could correspond to a body other than a black hole .",

    "if we proceeded to order @xmath587 in the matching procedure , we would find that the tidal fields appearing in the inner expansion are those of @xmath481 , rather than those of @xmath192 .",
    "these general points are shared with the derivation in refs .",
    "note , however , that my results differ considerably from those of refs .",
    "the first difference is that in those earlier calculations it was found that the tetrad on the worldline is not parallel - propagated in the external background spacetime .",
    "this followed from the fact that the spin dipole perturbation in the internal solution had been set to zero via a choice of gauge ; effectively , the fermi tetrad was required to rotate with the perturbed gravitational field , to set the total spin to zero . however ,",
    "this is not necessary : transforming from the external , nonrotating frame , to the internal , rotating frame ( or to a nonrotating frame in @xmath481 ) , simply requires a gauge transformation ( specifically generated by @xmath588 ) .",
    "there is no reason to require the external , background fermi tetrad in @xmath192 to spin .",
    "more importantly , my analysis has shown that the weak matching condition that is normally utilized is actually too weak to yield unique results . in order to arrive at an equation of motion",
    ", i have had to formulate a refined matching condition in a somewhat ad hoc manner .",
    "but even if that refinement is accepted , all of these derivations rely on another strong assumption : the form of the inner expansion , which fixes not only the background metric , but also the form the perturbations . by assuming that the metric in the inner expansion appears to that of a singular monopole perturbation atop some smooth background field that is expanded around a geodesic , the matching derivations of the self - force seem to implicitly assume a generalized equivalence principle",
    ": they assume that in vacuum , the black hole , as viewed from a distance , moves on a geodesic of some smooth spacetime .",
    "given that such a geodesic exists , the matching procedure provides a means of determining _ which _ smooth spacetime the geodesic lies in  but it does not prove the existence of the geodesic .    if the inner expansion is to be sufficiently general for the matching procedure to _ derive _ the generalized equivalence principle , rather than assume it , then one must use a less restricted inner expansion .",
    "for example , at linear order , no acceleration - like dipole term ( i.e. one behaving as @xmath589 in the buffer region ) can arise in the inner expansion without also introducing a mass dipole .",
    "however , in the inner expansion an acceleration term @xmath590 corresponds to a second - order perturbation @xmath591 , so in order to maintain that no such term can arise in mass - centered coordinates , one must solve the second - order efe in generality .",
    "in addition , if one uses the refined matching condition or some variant of it , one must prove that an acceleration term can not arise from a generically small coordinate transformation in the buffer region .",
    "it is not immediately clear that at second order , being in mass - centered coordinates implies that any acceleration - like term must vanish .",
    "solving the efe , in full generality , at second order also requires one to include potentially time - evolving shifts in the mass and spin of the black hole . the time - evolution , if any , of these parameters would be determined at second order .",
    "indeed , a time - dependent correction to the mass was found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in that paper , i performed a second - order analysis , but of a different sort than the one just suggested . instead of assuming that the small body is a black hole , and trying to solve the second - order efe in the whole of that black hole s spacetime , i allowed the body to be arbitrarily structured , and i solved the second - order efe in the outer expansion , and only in the buffer region .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for similar approaches at first order and in the case of a regular expansion , respectively . ) given the weaknesses of the method of matched asymptotic expansions , such a calculation provides a much firmer conclusion .",
    "however , if one is willing to accept the additional assumptions , matched asymptotic expansions provide a much simpler means of finding an equation of motion .",
    "in this paper , i have discussed three types of general expansions : dual expansions , multiscale expansions , and a self - consistent expansion .",
    "each of these can be used to systematically overcome the unbounded errors of a regular expansion , and at least two of them will likely be required in any successful analytical approach to the problem of motion for asymptotically small bodies . for example , whether a multiscale expansion or a self - consistent expansion is used to eliminate secular errors , it must be combined with an inner expansion to eliminate errors near the small body . and these expansions may need to be supplemented with a third expansion in the wave zone .",
    "however , these expansions are not merely powerful tools for finding asymptotic solutions to differential equations : they have a rich underlying geometrical structure , which i have sketched , but which warrants further study .",
    "this underlying structure allows us to , for example , easily define and conceptualize the representative worldline of a black hole .",
    "careful consideration of the underlying formalism can also reveal subtle yet important features of a calculation .",
    "for example , in moving from the realm of traditional perturbation theory to one with potentially multiple coordinate systems , two types of matching conditions arise , and the condition that has been implicitly used in previous derivations of the gravitational self - force is significantly weaker than the condition used in applied mathematics . in order to arrive at unique results with this matching condition , additional assumptions must be made , which weakens the conclusions of a matching calculation .",
    "it is my hope that this paper , by highlighting points such as these , will spur further research into the foundations of singular perturbation techniques in gr , in order to promulgate their utility , illuminate their underlying structure , and put them on a more precise and deductive mathematical basis .",
    "thanks to eric poisson and bob wald for helpful feedback , and to the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the mathematical expressions .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "to illustrate the procedure of matched asymptotic expansions , i consider the following boundary value problem : @xmath592 i assume that @xmath65 possesses an outer expansion @xmath593 . substituting this expansion into eq .   and equating coefficients of each power of @xmath5 to zero , we find @xmath594 and @xmath595 ; the boundary conditions are @xmath596 , @xmath597 , and @xmath598 .",
