    "the physics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems exposed to a continuous microwave irradiation in the presence of perpendicular magnetic fields @xmath1 has attracted both experimental and theoretical attention in the last years following the observation of the microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miros ) @xcite which evolve into  zero resistance states \" ( zrs ) @xcite for a sufficiently high microwave intensity . the miro periodicity is governed by the ratio of the radiation frequency @xmath2 to the cyclotron frequency @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the effective mass of the electrons .",
    "these oscillations occur because of landau quantization and originate from the scattering - assisted electron transitions between different landau levels , which become possible in the presence of microwave excitation .",
    "two competing microscopic mechanisms of the oscillating photoresistance have been proposed theoretically : the  displacement \" mechanism which accounts for spatial displacement of electrons along the applied dc field under scattering - assisted microwave absorption @xcite , and ",
    "inelastic \" mechanism , owing to an oscillatory contribution to the isotropic part of the electron distribution function @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms describe phase and periodicity of miros observed in experiments . a systematic theoretical study of photoresistance has revealed two additional mechanisms : the  quadrupole \" mechanism , which comes from excitation of the second angular harmonic of the distribution function , and  photovoltaic \" mechanism , which is described as a combined action of the microwave and dc fields on both temporal and angular harmonics of the distribution function @xcite .",
    "both additional mechanisms contribute to transverse ( hall ) dc resistance , while the photovoltaic mechanism contributes also to diagonal resistance .",
    "however , this contribution is found to be weak and has not been detected in miros observed in experiments .    for low temperatures the inelastic mechanism plays the dominant role because the relaxation of the microwave - induced oscillatory part of the electron distribution is slow .",
    "this relaxation is governed by the inelastic electron - electron scattering with a characteristic time @xmath5 , which is in the order of 1 ns at temperatures @xmath6  k. this @xmath7-dependence has also been found experimentally in ref .",
    "8 . nevertheless , recent experiments on high - mobility samples suggest that the displacement mechanism can not be ignored and becomes important with increasing temperature , when the relative contribution of the inelastic mechanism decreases @xcite .",
    "the crossover between these two mechanisms was observed at @xmath8 k. notice that , since these mechanisms produce nearly the same frequency dependence of miros , the only way to distinguish between them is to measure temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitudes . for a better understanding of the role of inelastic and displacement mechanisms in microwave - induced resistance of 2d electrons , systematic experiments in different samples",
    "are highly desirable .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a study of temperature dependence of magnetoresistance in two - subband electron systems formed in double quantum wells ( dqws ) .",
    "recently , we have found @xcite that the inelastic mechanism satisfactorily explains low - temperature photoresistance in such systems exposed to microwave irradiation .",
    "the main difference in magnetoresistance of two - subband electron systems with respect to conventional ( single - subband ) 2d systems is the presence of magneto - intersubband ( mis ) oscillations ( see refs . @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and references therein ) which occur owing to periodic modulation of the probability of intersubband transitions by the magnetic field . under microwave irradiation , these oscillations interfere with miros .",
    "the interference causes a peculiar magnetoresistance picture where one may see enhancement , suppression , or inversion ( flip ) of mis peaks , correlated with the microwave frequency @xcite .",
    "whereas such a behavior of magnetoresistance is more complicated than that for single - subband electron systems , it offers certain advantages in analyzing the effect of microwaves .",
    "the reason is that the quantum component of magnetoresistance , which is affected by the microwaves , is  visualized \" in dqws by the mis oscillations whose period is typically smaller than the period of the miros . as a result , the changes in miro amplitudes caused by variation in temperature or microwave intensity can be traced by observation of the behavior of single mis peaks , and the position of node points of the miros can be determined more distinctly by the mis peak inversion .",
    "our main result can be summarized as follows .",
    "we find that the inelastic mechanism fails to explain the observed photoresistance for @xmath9  k. the temperature dependence of magnetoresistance can be explained either by a deviation from the @xmath5 law at these temperatures or by inclusion of another , @xmath10-independent contribution to miros .",
    "the first possibility seems to be unlikely , because we see no reasons for such a deviation .",
    "the second possibility is more promising , and a consideration of an additional contribution owing to the displacement mechanism seems to be a natural choice .",
    "however , our quantitative estimates demonstrate that the crossover from the inelastic to the displacement mechanism of miros is expected at higher temperatures in our samples , around 10  k. therefore , the origin of the observed photoresistance behavior can be partially explained by a contribution of displacement mechanism but does not fully account for our finding .",

    "ii we present details of the experimental analysis and the theoretical consideration of the microwave - induced resistivity of two - subband systems . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the deviation from the inelastic mechanism with increasing temperature , compare our experimental results with the theory including both inelastic and displacement mechanisms , and formulate our conclusions .",

    "we have analyzed two wafers with @xmath13=14   and we focus in this paper on the samples with subband separation of @xmath14  =  3.05  mev . this value is extracted from the periodicity of low - field mis oscillations .",
    "the samples have a high total sheet electron density @xmath15 @xmath16 and a mobility of @xmath17 @xmath18/v s at 1.4  k. the measurements have been carried out in a vti cryostat using conventional lock - in technique to measure the longitudinal resistance @xmath19 under a continuous microwave irradiation . as mw sources , we employ different  carcinotron \" generators and we focus on the frequency range between 55 and 140  ghz .",

    "still , the heating of 2d electrons by microwaves is observable at these intensities by a suppression of sdh oscillations .",
    "this heating is not strong and does not lead to the bolometric effect at @xmath21 because of the radiative broadening of the cyclotron resonance @xcite , @xcite . for temperatures below 10 k the phonon - induced contribution to electron mobility in our samples is weak , so the transport is controlled by the electron - impurity scattering .",
