    "the simplest way to implement the existence of non - vanishing correlations @xmath29 corresponds to a linear coupling of the environment inverse temperature @xmath30 with the thermal fluctuations of the system energy : @xmath31where @xmath32 is a coupling constant that appears here as an additional control parameter . while the case with @xmath33 corresponds to the canonical ensemble ( [ can ] ) , where @xmath34 , in general , the constancy of the inverse temperature @xmath35 can be only ensured in the average sense , @xmath36 . eq.([linear.ansatz ] )",

    "for the particular case of the seven - states potts model , the consideration of any extended canonical mc algorithm enables a suppression of the super - critical slowing down associated with the occurrence of the temperature driven first - order phase transition of this model from an exponential growth to a very weak power - law dependence with exponent @xmath6 .",
    "there is still some open questions in regard to the potentialities of the present methodology .",
    "for example , although this method has been specially conceived to overcome the slow relaxations of canonical mc simulations near to a region with a first - order phase transition , in principle , there is no limitation that the same one can be also employed to improve canonical mc simulations near to a critical point of a continuous phase transition .",
    "moreover , a similar extension is possible to carry out for those mc methods based on the consideration of the boltzmann - gibbs distributions : @xmath310dedx\\ ] ] to account for the existence of anomalous values in other response functions besides the heat capacity .",
    "the analysis of these questions deserve a special attention in future works ."
