    "they connect @xmath0 surfaces with rational surfaces , enriques surfaces , and low genus curves . in this article",
    "we address the rationality problem for the moduli spaces of @xmath0 surfaces with non - symplectic involution .    to be more precise , let @xmath1 be a complex @xmath0 surface with an involution @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath2 acts nontrivially on @xmath3 , @xmath2 is called _ non - symplectic _ , and the pair @xmath4 is called a _ 2-elementary @xmath0 surface_. by nikulin @xcite , the deformation type of @xmath4 is determined by its _ main invariant _",
    "@xmath5 , a triplet of integers associated to the lattice of @xmath2-invariant cycles .",
    "he classified all main invariants of 2-elementary @xmath0 surface , which turned out to be seventy - five in number ( see figure [ nikulin table ] ) .",
    "for each main invariant @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be an even lattice of signature @xmath7 whose discriminant form is 2-elementary of length @xmath8 and parity @xmath9 .",
    "yoshikawa @xcite , @xcite showed that the moduli space @xmath10 of 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces of type @xmath5 is the complement of a heegner divisor in the arithmetic quotient defined by the orthogonal group @xmath11 of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , @xmath10 is irreducible of dimension @xmath12 .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ main ] the moduli space @xmath10 of 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces of type @xmath5 is rational , possibly except when @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining spaces @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively birational to the moduli spaces of plane sextics and of bidegree @xmath17 curves on @xmath18",
    ". the rationality questions for them are rather classical , and remain open .",
    "a few @xmath10 have been known to be rational : @xmath19 is the moduli of enriques surfaces and is rational by kond @xcite ; he also proved that @xmath20 is rational by identifying it with the moduli of certain trigonal curves @xcite ; @xmath21 is birational to the moduli of genus six curves ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and hence rational by shepherd - barron @xcite ; dolgachev and kond @xcite recently proved the rationality of @xmath22 , which is the moduli of coble surfaces .",
    "now theorem [ main ] shows that these results are not of sporadic nature .",
    "in other terms , the arithmetic quotients defined by @xmath11 for the 2-elementary primitive sublattices @xmath6 of the @xmath0 lattice are mostly rational .",
    "in @xcite we proved that all @xmath10 are unirational .",
    "the approach there was to use some isogenies between @xmath10 to reduce the problem to fewer main invariants .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we studied certain covers of @xmath10 rather than @xmath10 themselves .",
    "but the rationality problem is much more subtle , requiring individual treatment and delicate analysis .",
    "thus in this article we study the spaces @xmath10 one by one .",
    "although our approach is case - by - case , the schemes of proofs are common for most cases , which we shall try to explain here .",
    "we first find a _",
    "birational _ period map @xmath23 from the quotient space @xmath24 of an explicit parameter space @xmath25 by an algebraic group @xmath26",
    ". then we prove that @xmath24 is rational as a problem in invariant theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the space @xmath25 parametrizes ( possibly singular ) @xmath27-curves @xmath28 on some smooth rational surfaces @xmath29 , and the map @xmath30 is defined by taking the desingularizations of the double covers of @xmath29 branched along @xmath28 .",
    "thus our approach for 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces is essentially from quotient surfaces and branch curves .",
    "the fact that @xmath30 is birational means that our construction is  canonical \" for the generic member of @xmath10 .",
    "the verifications of this property mostly fall into the following two patterns : @xmath31 when the curves @xmath28 are smooth , so that the desingularization process does not take place , it is just a consequence of the equivalence between ( variety , involution ) and ( quotient , branch ) .",
    "this simple approach is taken when @xmath32 ( @xmath29 are del pezzo ) and when @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 for many other @xmath5 , the surfaces @xmath29 are @xmath35 or hirzebruch surfaces @xmath36 , the curves @xmath28 have simple singularities of prescribed type , and the group @xmath26 is @xmath37 . for this type of period map",
    "we can calculate its degree in a systematic manner .",
    "a recipe of such calculation is presented in ",
    "[ ssec : recipe ] . by finding a period map of degree @xmath38 of this type",
    ", our rationality problem is reduced to invariant theory over @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the existence of birational period map as above , especially of type @xmath34 , is a priori not clear .",
    "indeed , when @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and when @xmath42 , we give up the above two approaches and study a _",
    "non - birational _ period map @xmath43 of type @xmath34 .",
    "using the recipe in  [ ssec : recipe ] , we show that it is a quotient map by a weyl group , and then analyze that weyl group action to find a canonical construction .",
    "the proof for these cases would be more advanced than the above cases @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath34 . on the other hand , when @xmath44 , some of our birational period maps seem related to nakayama s minimal model process for log del pezzo surfaces of index @xmath45 @xcite , which may explain their birationality .    recall that for most @xmath5 the fixed locus @xmath46 of @xmath47 is the union of a genus @xmath48 curve @xmath49 and some other @xmath50-curves ( @xcite ) . as an application of our birational period maps",
    ", we will determine the generic structure of the fixed curve map @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",
    "the point is that @xmath53 is the composition of the inverse period map @xmath54 with the map @xmath55 that associates to a @xmath27-curve its component of maximal genus . we will find that the latter map identifies @xmath24 with a natural fibration over a sublocus of @xmath56 defined in terms of special line bundles and points .",
    "thus , via @xmath53 , @xmath10 is in a nice relation to @xmath56 .",
    "this generalizes the descriptions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 referred above .",
    "finally , we should explain that this article has been developed in two - steps .",
    "in an earlier version of this article , we could not prove the rationality of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , ( and @xmath22 ) by the above methods .",
    "after that version had circulated , dolgachev and kond @xcite settled the case of @xmath22 using a lattice - theoretic trick .",
    "then the referee and kond independently suggested that a similar technique is also applicable for @xmath58 , which is produced in the present article .",
    "afterwards , we developed the method of dolgachev - kond further and proved the rationality of @xmath57 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . in view of this development , we shall treat those four cases separately in the appendix .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . ",
    "[ sec : invariant theory ] and  [ sec : hirze ] are preliminaries on invariant theory . in  [ sec : 2-ele k3 ] , after reviewing basic theory of 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces , we explain how to calculate the degrees of certain period maps .",
