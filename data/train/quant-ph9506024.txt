    "sonoluminescence is the phenomenon of light emission by sound - driven gas bubbles in fluids , ordinarily air bubbles in water .",
    "sound makes bubbles collapse or expand , and a rapid flash of light is observed after each collapse .",
    "this phenomenon has been known for 60 years @xcite , but came under systematic investigation only recently when experimentalists succeeded in trapping bubbles and maintaining sonoluminescence as a stable process over hours or even days @xcite .    during stable sonoluminescence",
    "@xcite a bubble is trapped at the pressure antinode of a standing sound wave , which typically has a frequency of about 25 khz . with an astonishing clocklike precision the bubble sends off one sharp flash of light per acoustic cycle .",
    "less than 10 ps is commonly given as a conservative estimate of the pulse length .",
    "the observed jitter has been found to be extremely small and to show curious phase properties whose origin could so far not be identified @xcite .",
    "the spectral density of the light emitted drops with wavelength and resembles the tail of a black - body spectrum of several tens of thousand kelvin @xcite .",
    "whereas the dynamics of the bubble motion has been successfully explained and a theoretical model by lfstedt , barber , and putterman @xcite based on rather involved hydrodynamic calculations reproduces the experimentally measured time - dependence of the bubble radius @xcite remarkably well , the process of the light emission has so far defied any theoretical elucidation .",
    "that is why the present paper focuses on the radiation process , making use of the knowledge about the hydrodynamics of the bubble motion as input .",
    "there have been several attempts of explaining the light seen in sonoluminescence .",
    "the apparent similarity of the spectrum to a thermal spectrum has led to the hypothesis that the light might come from a process of black - body radiation or bremsstrahlung @xcite . along this line",
    "it has been argued that the gas in the collapsing bubble is compressed so strongly that a plasma is formed which then radiates .",
    "however , one can quickly convince oneself that neither black - body radiation nor bremsstrahlung can possibly account for the radiation observed in sonoluminescence .",
    "either of them would lead to a continuous spectrum whose major part would lie below the absorption edge of water at 180 nm and would therefore be absorbed by it . estimating from the corresponding visible part of the spectrum the amount of energy that would be absorbed , one obtains such a large number that one would expect to see rather obvious macroscopic consequences of the absorption @xcite , as for instance dissociation of the water molecules , formation of radicals etc .",
    ", which have not been observed .",
    "moreover , black - body radiation is an equilibrium phenomenon and involves several atomic transitions ; it could very unlikely explain pulse lengths of less than 10ps .",
    "neither is any explanation involving bremsstrahlung satisfactory , because it would entail the presence of free electrons and rather slow recombination radiation .",
    "rather more convincing is suslick s theory @xcite which explains the sonoluminescence spectra on the basis of pressure - broadened rotational and vibrational lines in diatomic emission spectra . for silicone - oil sonoluminescence",
    "one finds an excellent agreement of synthetic and observed spectra by considering emission from excited - state @xmath0 @xcite . for water , however , any attempts to model the spectrum on the basis of this theory have so far been unsuccessful , although the well - known 310 nm system of oh is thought to be largely responsible for the broad peak around this wavelength in the observed spectrum @xcite .",
    "the most recent speculation on the nature of sonoluminescence radiation is a theory of collision - induced emission @xcite , which , however , in its present version contains still too many indeterminate points and adjustable parameters to permit a judgement on its tenability .",
    "this article pursues a line of thought loosely inspired by schwinger @xcite who suggested that sonoluminescence could be some kind of dynamic casimir effect , which the present writer agrees with in so far as the light emission observed in sonoluminescence has , just like the casimir effect , its origin in the interaction of the vacuum fluctuations of the quantized electromagnetic field with a dielectric medium .",
    "sonoluminescence is , however , much more closely related to the unruh effect .",
    "let first the casimir effect @xcite be recalled : two parallel conducting or dielectric plates in vacuum feel an attractive force which arises from the boundary conditions the plates impose on the vacuum electromagnetic field .",
    "in a more intuitive picture one can understand the casimir effect in terms of van - der - waals forces ; the electromagnetic zero - point fluctuations induce local fluctuating dipoles in each of the plates and because of the spatial correlations of the fluctuations the interaction of these dipoles leads to a net attractive force .",
    "the unruh effect @xcite is a dynamic generalization of the casimir effect and predicts radiation by non - inertially moving mirrors .",
    "this phenomenon is not exclusive to perfect mirrors , i.e. perfect conductors ; quantum radiation by moving dielectrics has also been investigated @xcite , and moreover some of the pathological points of the perfect - reflector theories can be circumvented in the more physical case of dielectrics .",
    "again , the intuitive picture of the process is that the zero - point electromagnetic field excites fluctuating dipoles in the ( perfect or imperfect ) mirror and these dipoles are the source of radiation when the mirror moves non - uniformly .    a more rigorous way of understanding why a moving mirror that interacts with the vacuum fluctuations of the quantized photon field emits radiation , is to start by considering a nominally stationary mirror , with the intention of eventually applying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the radiation pressure on the mirror is given by the vacuum expectation value of the force operator @xmath1 , which is obtained from the stress - energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field subjected to appropriate boundary conditions on the surface of the mirror .",
    "the net force on a single stationary mirror in vacuum is of course zero by virtue of translation invariance , @xmath2 however , the mean - square deviation of this force does not vanish , since the force operator @xmath3 does not commute with the hamiltonian . in other words ,",
    "the mirror is exposed to radiation - pressure fluctuations , whose mean - square deviation is given by @xmath4 knowing that the force operator @xmath3 is ( just like the hamiltonian ) a functional that is quadratic in the field operators , i.e. quadratic in the photon annihilation and creation operators , one can use the decomposition of the identity into projection operators onto a complete set of photon eigenstates , of which then only two - photon states survive , and rewrite @xcite : @xmath5 this means that virtual two - photon states are perpetually excited by the mirror in the vacuum , in accordance with the fluctuating radiation pressure . yet",
    "the fluctuating forces on the left and right sides of the mirror are balanced against each other , so that no mean radiation pressure acts on the mirror . by virtue of lorentz invariance ,",
    "the same is true for a mirror that moves with constant velocity .",
    "however , when the mirror moves non - inertially , the radiation - pressure fluctuations on opposite sites of the mirror are out of balance and the mirror experiences a non - vanishing frictional force .",
    "the virtual two - photon states turn into real states , and the loss of momentum by the radiation of the photon pairs provides the physical mechanism for the friction felt by the mirror .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem puts this into formulae and interrelates the power spectrum of the fluctuations on the stationary mirror and the dissipative part of the response function that connects the force on the moving mirror to its velocity @xcite .",
    "it is a well - established fact that radiation by moving mirrors shows thermal properties although one is dealing with _",
    "zero_-temperature quantum field theory .",
    "the original statement of the unruh effect @xcite is that a mirror moving with constant proper acceleration @xmath6 in vacuum appears to be radiating particles as if it were a black body at a temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the photons are radiated in correlated pairs , in the language of quantum optics  they form a two - mode squeezed state , and the observation of the single - photon spectrum involves a tracing over the other photon of the pair which is well - known to entail thermal properties of the state @xcite .",
    "formally this connection is established by representing the two - mode state in a dual hilbert space and making contact with the theory of thermofield dynamics @xcite .    as to an experimental verification of the unruh effect ,",
    "the record is empty .",
    "understandably so , because the unruh temperature is tiny for commonly achievable accelerations .",
    "the only viable suggestion for an experiment has come from yablonovitch @xcite , who thought that the sudden ionization of a gas or a semiconductor crystal might produce an accelerating discontinuity in the refractive index fast enough to radiate a measurable amount of photons .    from all of the above",
    ", quantum vacuum radiation seems to be a good candidate for explaining the radiation process in sonoluminescence .",
    "the surface of the bubble is the moving interface of discontinuous polarizability , i.e. the moving mirror . in the visible range water",
    "has a refractive index of 1.3 , and the gas inside the bubble has a refractive index of practically 1 even when strongly compressed .",
    "although the discontinuity of 0.3 in the refractive index is not huge , it is large enough to radiate an appreciable number of photons if the motion is sufficiently fast .",
    "in fact , the discontinuity in the refractive index will enter the final results for the radiated spectrum merely as a prefactor , and hence only its order of magnitude is important .    of much greater significance",
    "is the highly non - linear dynamics of the bubble motion . at the point",
    "when the bubble collapses and starts re - expanding , the velocity of the interface changes its sign .",
    "as known from experiments @xcite as well as from model calculations of the bubble dynamics @xcite this turn - around is extremely fast , which means that tremendous accelerations and higher moments of the motion are involved .",
    "the present theory predicts a burst of photons as a consequence .",
    "as it will be shown in more detail in the course of this article , the theory of quantum vacuum radiation resolves several to date unexplained issues .",
    "the fact that the photons are radiated in correlated pairs leads to thermal properties of the one - photon spectrum , unrelated to the temperature in the bubble which is presumably far too small to cause any major effect .    in accordance with a weakly frequency - dependent refractive index",
    "the radiation spectrum shows features at the resonance frequencies of the dipolar molecules in the medium . as water molecules",
    "are highly polarizable , this is to be expected a discernible effect ; it explains the relation of the peak around 310 nm in the spectrum to the well - known oh line .",
    "barely any photons are created below the absorption edge of water , as the polarizability is far too small in this region .",
    "therefore , few photons are absorbed and no macroscopically noticeable changes of the water are to be expected .",
    "the pulse length predicted by the theory of quantum vacuum radiation is of the order of the time it takes for the zero - point fluctuations to correlate around the bubble . with bubble sizes of around @xmath8 or less , the time light takes to cross the bubble is in the femtosecond range .",
    "otherwise the time - scale is of course influenced by the dynamics of the motion of the bubble interface at and just after the collapse .",
    "the theory of quantum vacuum radiation by a gas bubble in water will be expounded in the following sections .",
    "water will be understood as a non - absorbing dielectric describable by a constant refractive index .",
    "this is a good approximation in the spectral region of interest where water is only weakly dispersive . by virtue of adiabaticity",
    "the refractive index @xmath9 can be replaced by @xmath10 in the end result for the radiated spectrum .",
    "the gas inside the bubble is optically so thin , even at the collapse of the bubble , that its refractive index will be assumed to be 1 throughout the calculation .",
    "the bubble will be considered as externally driven , i.e. the radius of the bubble as a prescribed function of time ; the hydrodynamics of the bubble motion is not the concern of this paper . however , the back - reaction of the radiation process on the motion of the bubble will be specified .",
    "hence the problem is reduced to a model of a spherical cavity of radius @xmath11 in a homogeneous non - dispersive dielectric described by a constant refractive index @xmath9 .",
    "the radiated spectral density will be obtained as a functional of @xmath11 .",
    "the next section deals with the quantization of the photon field in the presence of a stationary spherical bubble in a homogeneous dielectric . in section",
    "iii the schrdinger equation for the photon state - vector is written down , and the vacuum - to - two - photon transition - amplitude is calculated by a method of time - dependent perturbation theory that accommodates both an adiabatic time - dependence of the hamiltonian and a perturbative addition to the zero - order hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "section iv states and examines the results for the radiated energy and the spectral density .",
    "the appearance of a thermal - like spectrum is demonstrated and numerical results are presented .",
    "finally , section v gives a summary and a critical reflection on the theory of quantum vacuum radiation by sonoluminescent bubbles .",
    "strengths and weaknesses of the theory are scrutinized , and open questions are voiced .",
    "readers not interested in the technicalities of the theory are encouraged to look over section iv for an aggregate of the essential results and to read section v for a guided summary and interpretation of all results .",
    "several appendices contribute technical details necessary for the clarity of the presentation .",
    "appendix a calculates the hamiltonian for a uniformly moving dielectric in preparation for section iii .",
    "appendix b gives the mode - expansion for the helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates , which is essential throughout the paper .",
    "the force on a stationary dielectric is determined in appendix c.    cgs units are used everywhere in the paper ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are set equal to 1 unless explicitly indicated .",
    "all special functions are defined as in refs .",
    "the hamiltonian for the electromagnetic field in the presence of a medium with dielectric function @xmath14 reads @xmath15 a bubble of radius @xmath16 is described by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this is to say that the dielectric constant equals 1 in the interior of the bubble and @xmath19 in the surrounding medium .",
    "the maxwell equations imply continuity conditions for the fields across the boundary ; these are :    @xmath20    or in spherical coordinates    @xmath21    the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) depends parametrically on the bubble radius @xmath16 via the dielectric function @xmath22 . although a problem with a varying bubble size is aspired to be solved , for the purpose of quantizing the photon field the radius of the bubble will be kept constant . in order to quantize the system for a time - dependent radius @xmath11",
    "one would need to know the eigenfunctions of the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) ; but knowing them would amount to the exact solution of the whole problem which is of course unachievable . as the calculation to follow in the next section will employ perturbation theory to first order in the velocity of the bubble surface @xmath23 over the speed of light in vacuum ,",
    "a quantization for constant @xmath16 is fully sufficient .",

    "what will be extracted from the mode expansion of @xmath46 are products of two photon creation operators @xmath47 which induce two - photon transitions from the vacuum .",
    "since , however , creation operators commute mutually , operator ordering is inessential .    to describe the sonoluminescence process by the hamiltonian ( 3.2 ) means to ignore variations of the refractive index due to the periodic compression of the water in the vicinity of the bubble",
    "this is a crude but innocuous approximation as long as the energies of the phonons excited in the water stay below those of the emitted photons .",
    "initially the photon field is in its vacuum state while the bubble is at rest and has some radius @xmath16 . as discussed at the end of the preceding section , the photon eigenstates depend parametrically on the radius @xmath16 of the bubble .",

    "the established way of dealing with slowly parameter - dependent hamiltonians is the adiabatic approximation @xcite .",
    "however , the standard adiabatic approximation requires the knowledge of the complete set of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian for any allowed value of the parameter . in the present case",
    "only the eigenfunctions of part of the hamiltonian , namely those of @xmath49 , are known .",
    "hence what is required is a judicious combination of standard perturbation theory and the standard adiabatic approximation ; needed is a theory that is capable of dealing both with a perturbative interaction hamiltonian and with a hamiltonian depending on a slowly varying parameter .    following the adiabatic theory by pauli @xcite , one starts with the eigenvalue equation for the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath49 , solved for all possible values of the parameter @xmath16 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath9th eigenvalue and @xmath52 the corresponding eigenvector . here",

    "( [ fullp ] ) and ( [ helpr ] ) in the regime where the radiated photon wavelengths get in resonance with the bubble size can be anticipated to relax this requirement to a turn - around time of roughly 100fs@xmath16310ps , which seems quite realistic .",
    "unfortunately , it is notoriously difficult to determine @xmath140 experimentally , as it is arduous to measure the bubble radius close to the collapse ; the laser light that is used to determine the bubble radius by means of fitting the scattering data to the mie theory , is then most likely reflected by the shock - wave front propagating through the water rather then by the actual bubble surface @xcite .",
    "in addition , one might also have to take into account that the bubble shape deviates , perhaps even substantially , from spherical .",
    "although this does not affect the present theory of the radiation mechanism to any discernible extent , since the spectrum of the vacuum fluctuations is known to be affected by the shape only to higher order @xcite , it will noticeably alter the light - scattering properties so that the mie scattering theory is no longer applicable .",
    "nevertheless , the currently available experimental data seem to suggest that @xmath140 lies somewhere in the interval 100fs@xmath16310ps@xcite .",
    "the similarity of the observed photon spectrum to a black - body spectrum has its origin in the fact that the photon radiation emerges in coherent pairs . to obtain the single - photon spectrum , which is the one measured in spectral analyses",

    "( [ spectr ] ) .",
    "this process of tracing is known to engender thermal properties of the single - photon spectrum , even though the original two - photon state was a pure state and one has dealt with zero - temperature quantum field theory throughout @xcite . in other words , it is the particular correlations within the radiated photon pairs that engender the thermal - like properties of the spectrum , and thermal processes are completely independent of this and in the case of sonoluminescence presumably of no significance whatsoever .",
    "features in the otherwise smooth experimental spectra can be explained by a combination of three things :    _ ( i ) _ resonance effects in the radiation mechanism occur when the size of the bubble @xmath11 and the photon wavelengths @xmath165 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the features seen in the numerically calculated spectral density in figure 2 are due to higher - order resonances of this kind where the @xmath16 is an integer multiple of @xmath165 ; for direct resonances one expects much stronger effects .",
    "general predictions for such features can hardly be made as their detailed qualities are determined by the time - dependence of @xmath16 , which leads over to the next point .    _",
    "( ii ) _ choosing gases other than air for the bubble contents leads to a modified dynamics of the bubble surface , as gas solubilities in water vary ; but even a slightly different @xmath11 around the collapse will change the structure of the resonance effects between @xmath165 and @xmath16 , which is why one expects a strong dependence of the sonoluminescence spectra on the gas that saturates the water , as indeed observed in experiments @xcite .    _",
    "( iii ) _ the experimentally seen features in the spectrum might just as well be caused by dispersion , i.e. the dependence of the refractive index @xmath9 on the photon frequency @xmath149 .",
    "as long as @xmath9 depends only weakly on @xmath149 , one can replace @xmath9 by @xmath10 in eqs .",
    "( [ fullp ] ) and ( [ specdens ] ) by virtue of adiabaticity .",
    "this explains that the experimental data show features at frequencies close to the vibration - rotation excitations of the water molecule @xcite . especially , one can expect this to be the dominant effect in the spectra of multi - bubble sonoluminescence , as the resonances discussed under _ ( i ) _ above will average out if bubbles grow and collapse in a random manner .",
    "apart from predicting the radiated spectrum , the theory of quantum vacuum radiation solves several conceptual problems that previous theories have not been able to deal with satisfactorily .",
    "most importantly , the present theory has no difficulty in explaining the extreme shortness of the emitted light pulses ; their duration is determined by the parameter @xmath140 describing the turn - around time at the collapse and the time it takes for the fluctuations to correlate around the bubble . as the latter is on the scale of merely one or a few femtoseconds",
    ", @xmath140 is the decisive quantity .",
    "thus one expects the pulse length to lie between 100fs and 10ps , which tallies with the experimental observations .",
    "another major question that is successfully answered by the present theory concerns the absence of radiation below the absorption edge of water at around 180 nm .",
    "water has essentially no polarizability below this wavelength , so that the real part of its refractive index is very close to 1 .",
    "hence the mechanism of exciting vacuum fluctuations into real photon pairs is inoperative below 180 nm ; no radiation is emitted and no radiation has to be re - absorbed .",
    "this explains the absence of any macroscopically discernible effect on the water by the large amounts of absorbed light predicted by theories of black - body radiation or bremsstrahlung ( cf .",
    "i a ) .",
    "thinking about experiments that distinguish the present from other theories of sonoluminescence , one quickly comes up with two relatively simple ones .",
    "one is to look for photons emitted in the x - ray transparency window of water @xcite ; both the black - body and the bremsstrahlung theories predict a perceptible amount of photons with wavelengths of around 1 , whereas the present theory denies any photon emission at such short wavelengths since the polarizability of water is essentially zero for x - rays , i.e. @xmath166 .    the second presumably easily set up experiment is to force the bubble into an elongated rather than spherical shape by using piezoelectric transducers on two or all three axes and to examine the angular distribution of the emitted light .",
    "for such a case the present theory , unlike others , predicts an anisotropic intensity ; the number of photons radiated into a given direction is roughly proportional to the cross - section of the bubble perpendicular to that direction .",
    "thus , if the bubble is spheroidal rather than spherical during the radiation process , one expects anisotropy .      the most important point still to be attended to is to extend the numerical calculations of the spectral density ( [ fullp ] ) down to realistic minimum bubble sizes of one micron or less @xcite .",
    "this will allow one to make more precise statements as to the turn - around time @xmath140 required to produce the experimentally observed number of photons ( cf .",
    "a _ 1 _ ) and to explore the effects of resonances if the bubble size is comparable to the photon wavelengths ( cf .",
    "a _ 3 _ ) .",
    "another effect to be studied in detail is the photon radiation produced by the rapid variation of the refractive index of water due to the rapidly varying compression around the outside of the bubble @xcite .",
    "preliminary estimations have shown that this mechanism is of secondary importance for the sonoluminescence problem ; to understand the principle of it might , however , be useful in view of other applications .",
    "an academic , but nevertheless interesting question to ask is where the photons actually are produced .",
    "a model calculation for a one - dimensional moving dielectric filling a half - space @xcite has indicated that , although the emission of this kind of quantum vacuum radiation depends on the existence of a moving interface between two media of different refractive indices , the photons do not come directly from the interface but from within a certain vicinity of it , as suggested also by physical intuition .",
    "however , inconsistencies between where the photons are produced and which the support of the radiation pressure on the dielectric is , are buried in the assumption of a perfectly rigid dielectric .    the hydrodynamics of the bubble has been considered as given in the present work ; its theory has been quite successfully established @xcite . however , especially in view of relaxing restrictions on the velocity and the acceleration of the bubble surface in that theory and of scrutinizing the bubble dynamics at the moment of collapse , the important role of the back - reaction of the photon radiation onto the bubble should be recognized .",
    "the momentum loss due to the radiation process might have a significant effect on the bubble . while the emission lasts the equations motion of the liquid - gas interface will be supplemented by a frictional force which is roughly proportional to the fourth derivative of the velocity of the interface , as discussed just below eq .",
    "( [ wres ] ) .",
    "one of the puzzles that remain is why stable single - bubble sonoluminescence is seen only in water , although multi - bubble sonoluminescence has been observed in a variety of fluids .",
    "the present author s conjecture is that the reason for this is buried in the unusual properties of gas solubility of water , which conspire with hydrodynamic mechanisms to lead to a exceptionally sharp and violent collapse of a driven bubble . in other fluids",
    "such conditions might be reached at random , but not in a regular fashion to produce radiation from stably maintained bubbles .      to close a conceptual remark",
    "might be appropriate . at first sight",
    ", the idea that the burst of photons seen in sonoluminescence has its origin in the zero - point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field might seem utterly strange , as one tends to think of low - energy photons emitted from material media as coming from atomic transitions .",
    "pondering on this , one has to admit that all we really know is that photons come from some kind of moving charge or , field - theoretically speaking , from the coupling to a fermion field .",
    "as we structure our thinking , we are most inclined to consider atoms as the basic entities of all materials and try to explain all physical phenomena on this basis .",
    "however , there is no reason for so doing ; we are completely at liberty to mentally re - group these charges in a variety of different ways and should choose whichever is most appropriate for the problem at hand . in the case of sonoluminescence atoms",
    "are obviously not the basic entities to be considered , since atomic transitions are about a thousand times slower than a sonoluminescence pulse . here",
    "the basic structure of the medium with respect to the radiation process is most suitably thought of as an assembly of dipoles with a certain dielectric response .",
    "this point of view enables one to consider the cooperative response of the charges to the zero - point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , and quantum vacuum radiation emerges as a consequence quite naturally .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank peter w. milonni for drawing my attention to the phenomenon of sonoluminescence , for pointing out to me julian schwinger s thought that this might relate to the zero - point fluctuations of the photon field , and for urging me to apply my knowledge from the theory of moving dielectrics to this problem .",

    "there are several ways of deriving an expression for the force applied by an electromagnetic field on a dielectric body ; the physically most intuitive one is to consider the force as ensuing from induced currents and surface - charge densities .    in lorentz gauge or in coulomb gauge without free charges",

    "however , the gradient of @xmath231 in ( [ rhoind ] ) brings about a @xmath232 function on the surface of the cavity , which is multiplied by the electric field in eq ( [ forcedens ] ) for the force density .",
    "the mathematically and physically correct prescription is to substitute the electric field by the average of its values on the two sides of the boundary .",
    "then one obtains for the radial component of the force on a spherical bubble of radius @xmath16 @xmath233      \\ ; , \\label{force}\\ ] ] where the integral runs over the complete solid angle ; the tangential components of the force are zero as obvious from symmetry .",
    "strictly speaking , the expression ( [ force ] ) is of course the force on the dielectric and not the force on the bubble .",
    "nevertheless , since the two are complementary and the force density has @xmath232-support on the boundary , i.e. the force is really applied only to the interface , it seems reasonable to speak of the force as acting on the bubble .",
    "another , less palpable and more formal way of calculating the force density ( [ forcedens ] ) is to proceed from the stress - energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field . in this approach care",
    "must be taken when interpreting formulae , because the momentum density of the photon field in a dielectric medium is subject to ambiguity .",
    "however , this issue will not be addressed here as the force density is unequivocally defined and interpretable .    the stress exerted by the fields alone , i.e. the fields as in vacuum and exclusive of the polarization fields inside the dielectric ,",
    "is given by the space - like components of the stress - energy - momentum tensor in vacuum @xmath234 in vacuum there is no doubt about the momentum density carried by the field ; it reads @xmath235 which is just the poynting vector .",
    "overall momentum balance requires that the change in the mechanical momentum density of the material ( i.e. the force density on the dielectric ) together with the change in the momentum of the fields alone ( [ momvac ] ) equal the negative gradient of the stress ( [ tvac ] ) due to the fields , @xmath236 \\ , = \\ ,",
    "-\\nabla_j     t^{ij}_{(0 ) } ( \\varepsilon\\ ! = \\!1)\\;.\\ ] ] thus the force density is given by @xmath237 a few trivial transformations taking into account vector identities and the maxwell equations yield @xmath238 upon integration over the bubble the first part of this expression is easily seen to lead to the @xmath239-dependent terms in the force ( [ force ] ) . in order to recognize the second part one should note that @xmath240 is zero inside as well as outside the dielectric , but non - zero at the interface ; @xmath241 gives a @xmath232 function on the surface multiplied by the difference of the outer and the inner electric fields .",
    "thus one recovers the induced surface - charge density ( [ rhoind ] ) , the force on which engenders the same @xmath242-dependent term as in ( [ force ] ) before .",
