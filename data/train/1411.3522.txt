    "modulation doped sige / ge / sige structures with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hole gas are attractive systems for both fundamental and applied studies since they are compatible with silicon - based technology and , at the same time , have a record high hole mobility among all group iv semiconductors .",
    "as compared to silicon - based metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect - transistor structures , they are also characterized by a strong spin - orbit coupling and a large and strongly anisotropic @xmath7-factor , which is of interest for the study of spin - related phenomena .",
    "however , the details of the band structure and the quantum transport in @xmath0-sige / ge / sige systems have not yet been sufficiently explored .",
    "it is known , that due to the lattice constant mismatch the 2d hole channel is located in strained ge so that , the ground subband is formed by heavy - hole ( hh ) states while the light - hole ( lh ) subband is split off by a hundred mev .",
    "@xcite the splitting should suppress the hh - lh mixing and lead to a strong anisotropy of the hh @xmath7-factor tensor with vanishingly small in - plane component @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite one can therefore expect that the transport properties of the hole channel in sige / ge / sige are determined by the normal component of the magnetic field only ,  @xcite as they are in a strained @xmath0-type channel of a@xmath9b@xmath10 semiconductors .",
    "@xcite such a behavior has been observed in @xmath0-ge / sige multilayer structures by studying the resistivity oscillations in tilted magnetic fields up to a tilt angle of 60@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite what concerns us about the absolute value of the hh out - of - plane @xmath7-factor , @xmath12 , is that the data available in literature vary from 20.4 for bulk ge ,  @xcite to 16.5 for strained ge ,  @xcite to 14.2 and 5.8 for @xmath0-ge / gesi multilayers ,  @xcite and to 1 for a single quantum well .",
    "@xcite these drastically different values may be the result of many - body effects and spectrum nonparabolicity  @xcite which are also responsible for the observed dependence of the in - plane effective mass on the hole density.@xcite    in this paper , we report a comprehensive study of the high - frequency conductivity of the high - mobility 2d hole gas embedded in a sigi / ge / sige structure in tilted magnetic fields .",
    "the measurements are carried out by means of the contactless surface acoustic wave technique .",
    "it probes the `` bulk '' electric properties of the two - dimensional system and provides information on the 2d hole energy spectrum unaffected by chiral edges which play a key role in conventional four - probe measurements of the quantum hall effect .",
    "the experimental data allow us to determine the hole cyclotron mass from the temperature dependence of shubnikov - de  haas ( sdh ) oscillations and the effective @xmath6 factor for our samples .",
    "we find that both the cyclotron mass and the @xmath6 factor can be tuned by applying an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "raising the in - plane field component @xmath13 leads to an increase of the cyclotron mass and decrease of the @xmath6 factor .",

    "<S> the high - frequency ( ac ) conductivity of a high quality modulation doped gesi / ge / gesi single quantum well structure with hole density @xmath0=6@xmath110@xmath2@xmath3 was measured by the surface acoustic wave ( saw ) technique at frequencies of 30 and 85  mhz and magnetic fields @xmath4 of up to 18 t in the temperature range of 0.3  5.8 k. the acoustic effects were also measured as a function of the tilt angle of the magnetic field with respect to the normal of the two - dimensional channel at @xmath5=0.3 k. it is shown , that at the minima of the conductivity oscillations , holes are localized on the fermi level , and that there is a temperature domain in which the high - frequency conductivity in the bulk of the quantum well is of the activation nature . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the temperature dependence of the conductivity at odd filling factors enables us to determine the effective @xmath6 factor . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the in - plane component of the magnetic field leads to an increase of the cyclotron mass and to a reduction of the @xmath6 factor . </S>",
    "<S> we developed a microscopic theory of these effects for the heavy - hole states of the complex valence band in quantum wells which describes well the experimental findings . </S>"
