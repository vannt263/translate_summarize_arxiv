    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb ) was the first cosmic background radiation to be discovered @xcite ; however , its origin is not fully understood yet .",
    "deep extragalactic x - ray surveys have resolved @xmath1 of the cxrb into point sources , with the resolved fraction increasing at higher energies @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that the resolved cxrb is mostly produced by the integrated emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at @xmath2 and galaxies located at redshifts out to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , a part of the cxrb remains unresolved and its origin is still undetermined .",
    "the largest fraction of the unresolved cxrb is in the soft ( @xmath0 kev ) band , which has been explored by a number of x - ray missions @xcite ; the unresolved fraction is 24.3% of the total @xmath4 background measured by _",
    "@xcite in this band .",
    "future missions such as the proposed x - ray surveyor @xcite and athena should be able to resolve this fraction , thus further constraining the contribution of distant and faint x - ray sources .    at present , the nature of the unresolved fraction of the cxrb is still debated . on the one hand ,",
    "measurements of the x - ray background hint that in the soft band normal galaxies may play an increasingly important role @xcite , likely dominating over agn at fluxes below the detection limit of _ chandra _",
    "( @xmath5 in this band ) . extrapolating the available data",
    ", @xcite predicted that the number density of star - forming galaxies should overtake that of agn at fluxes just below @xmath6 . in agreement",
    ", @xcite found that the normal - galaxy number counts rise rapidly at the faint end , compared to those of agn , and contribute @xmath7 of the number counts in the soft band found in the _ chandra _ deep field - south . on the other hand",
    ", an increasing number of faint and high - redshift quasars is being discovered with infrared , optical and x - ray surveys @xcite , supporting the idea that black holes may have a stronger than expected contribution to the cxrb @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the universe , based on theoretical models and numerical simulations , suggests scenarios from which the excess of the soft x - ray background might naturally emerge .",
    "current models show that the unresolved cxrb in the @xmath0 kev band can be produced by faint point sources , either agn or galaxies , with a possible additional contribution produced by truly diffuse components such as the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite assumed a power - law x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sources and varied their x - ray luminosity per unit star formation rate with redshift , showing that faint galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath8 can fully account for the unresolved portion of the cxrb ; @xcite investigated the power spectrum of the unresolved cxrb in the soft band and interpreted the signal as a mixture of contributions from low - luminosity agn ( @xmath9 ) , galaxies up to @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and thermal emission of the igm ( @xmath12 ) , where the contribution of galaxies was modeled with a power - law sed and normalized using the observed x - ray luminosity function ; @xcite showed that a population of high - redshift quasars and agn with a piece - wise power - law sed @xcite can explain @xmath13 of the unresolved cxrb at @xmath14 kev .",
    "the latter possibility is particularly interesting since , according to @xcite , such a population of sources could also fully reionize hydrogen and helium if their uv emissivity is normalized to the recent results of @xcite .    naturally , it is tempting to explain the excess in the soft cxrb as a contribution of high - redshift x - ray sources @xcite in galaxies existing before the end of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these galaxies emit uv and x - ray photons which ionize and heat the intergalactic gas .",
    "while uv radiation has a small mean free path in the neutral medium and , thus , reionizes gas close to the source @xcite , x - ray photons travel hundreds of comoving megaparsecs away , heating and partially ionizing the neutral gas far from the sources @xcite .",
    "in most of the currently discussed models of reionization , uv photons are more efficient than x - rays in ionizing the medium , and reionization proceeds inside - out down to the scale of the h  ii bubbles @xcite , while x - rays only preheat the igm .",
    "this picture , however , depends on the relative normalization of the two processes and there are scenarios in which x - rays are more efficient than the uv photons in driving reionization , and it proceeds more homogeneously , with significant smoothing up to the typical x - ray mean free path @xcite .",
    "the hardest x - rays emitted by a population of high - redshift sources are expected to have such large mean free paths that they are never absorbed by the igm and , thus , contribute to the unresolved soft cxrb observed today .    the extent to which the first x - ray sources contribute to the cxrb , as well as their role in the thermal history and reionization of the igm , depends on their nature . at present these sources",
    "are poorly constrained due to the lack of observations and there are several possible candidates , including x - ray binaries ( xrb ) @xcite , mini - quasars @xcite , and hot gas in galaxies , hard photons emitted as a result of high - redshift supernovae activity @xcite , as well as more exotic candidates such as annihilating dark matter @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of x - ray photons emitted in each case depends on the character of the sources , varying from a hard spectrum that peaks at the photon energy of @xmath16 kev , as in the currently favored case of xrbs @xcite , to a soft power - law sed expected from hot gas heated by supernova explosions and winds within galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the details of cosmic heating and reionization affect the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this radio signal , which is hoped to be the richest future probe of astrophysics and cosmology at high redshifts , is sensitive to the spectrum and nature of the early x - ray sources @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the redshifted 21-cm signal while constraining the luminosity of the high - redshift x - ray sources by the observed soft cxrb .",
    "the cxrb constraint yields an upper limit on the x - ray efficiency of each type of source and thus allows us to estimate the maximal possible effect of cosmic heating on the 21-cm signal .",
    "such a limit has not been quoted before , although the effect of strong soft x - ray sources on the 21-cm signal has been studied @xcite .",
    "moreover , we improve over the existing works by considering the cxrb limits on two new types of x - ray sources , namely , realistic x - ray binaries and mini - quasars , both with a hard sed . given the great current uncertainty about the properties of early galaxies , this is an essential constraint that will help guide the search for the radio signal by existing , planned and upcoming radio telescopes designed to probe the 21-cm signal out to @xmath17 , such as the square kilometer array ( ska , @xcite ) , the hydrogen epoch of reionization array ( hera ) , large aperture experiment to detect the dark age ( leda , @xcite ) , the experiment to detect the global eor step ( edges , @xcite ) , the dark ages radio explorer ( dare , @xcite ) , the shaped antenna measurement of the background radio spectrum ( saras , @xcite ) , the sci - hi experiment @xcite , the donald c. backer precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper , @xcite ) , giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt , @xcite ) , the murchison widefield array ( mwa , @xcite ) , the low - frequency array ( lofar , @xcite ) , and the new extension in nanay upgrading lofar ( nenufar , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sim ] we describe the simulation and model assumptions used in this work ; in section [ sec : cxrb ] we ( 1 ) use the observed unresolved cxrb to establish the upper bound on the x - ray efficiency of high - redshift sources , and ( 2 ) apply the existing upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum to set the lower limit on the x - ray efficiency ; in section [ sec : res ] we present our results for the thermal history , partial x - ray ionization , and the 21-cm signal ; finally , we summarize and conclude in section [ sec : sum ] . throughout this paper",
    "we use cosmological parameters as measured by the planck collaboration @xcite .",
    "we simulated large cosmological volumes of 384@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 of the high redshift universe using a hybrid simulation , first introduced by @xcite and described in detail by @xcite ; we describe it briefly here . using the known statistical properties of the initial density field",
    ", we generated a random realization of the initial overdensity ( with periodic boundary conditions ) and the supersonic relative velocities between the gas and dark matter @xcite in a cubic volume .",
    "given the large - scale density distribution , we then computed the gas fraction in star - forming halos in each cell as a function of time . in our simulation the star formation rate , found following the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite , is modified by the large - scale density fluctuations and the supersonic relative velocities . throughout the simulation we assume population ii stars with standard spectra [ from @xcite ] and a star formation efficiency of 5% .",
    "we also account for the effect of photoheating feedback on the amount of gas available for star formation @xcite .",
    "next , we use the stellar distribution to determine the x - ray heating rate , ionization , free electron fraction and the intensity of the ly-@xmath19 background in each cell . to this end , we first smooth the stellar density field at each redshift in shells around each cell .",
    "we assume the flux of x - ray and ly-@xmath19 photons emitted from each shell to be proportional to the star formation rate , which is in turn proportional to the time derivative of the amount of gas in star forming halos .",
    "we then compute the heating and ionization rates as well as the intensity of the ly-@xmath19 background by integrating over all the shells seen by each cell [ using rates from @xcite ] . in this",
    "integral , the contribution of each cell to the rate at a given central cell is computed at the time - delayed redshift as seen by the central cell .",
    "given the x - ray heating and ionization rates versus redshift at each cell , we integrated to get the gas temperature and free electron fraction as a function of time . to include uv reionization , we set each cell to be fully reionized if some sphere around it contains enough ionizing photons to self - reionize @xcite . with this simulation",
    "we followed the thermal history of the universe and made predictions for the observable soft band cxrb and the 21-cm signal from a wide range of redshifts , @xmath20 , as discussed in sections [ sec : cxrb ] and [ sec : res ] .",
    "this tool , based on a combination of numerical simulation and analytical calculations has enough flexibility to explore various parameters of the unconstrained high redshift environment such as the x - ray efficiency ( @xmath21 ) and sed of the first heating sources , the minimal mass of star forming halos and the reionization history . to probe the parameter space we consider two cases in which the igm is reionized by uv photons emitted by early galaxies . in the `` late reionization '' case",
    "the universe is fully reionized by @xmath22 , with the value of the electron optical depth falling in the range @xmath23 which is within @xmath24 of the latest planck result , @xmath25 , @xcite ; while in the second case , `` early reionization '' , @xmath26 and @xmath27 falls within @xmath28 of the planck measurement .",
    "late versus early reionization scenarios are obtained by varying the ionizing efficiency of sources in each model .",
    "when we normalize the x - ray emission ( see below ) , we also use the redshift of full reionization as the cut - off time for this normalization ; in this way , the two cases with different values of @xmath29 also serve to probe which redshifts are really constrained by the x - ray background .",
    "next , we consider two possible cases for the typical galactic halo mass : including star formation in halos down to the lowest mass that allows for efficient atomic cooling , which we term the `` atomic cooling '' case , or adopting a minimum halo mass for star formation that is ten times larger ( allowing for the possibility of strong feedback in small halos ) , which we refer to as `` massive halos '' . finally , we consider three types of x - ray sources : x - ray binaries that have a hard sed @xcite , sources with a soft power - law sed of spectral index @xmath30 [ where the luminosity @xmath31 follows @xmath32 @xcite , and mini - quasars , i.e. , central black holes in early star - forming galaxies , which we discuss in greater detail in section [ sec : mq ] .",
    "the efficiency of hot gas or x - ray binaries is defined via the relation between the bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath33 and the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the galaxy @xmath34 where the standard value of the x - ray efficiency is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this relation is based on observations of nearby starburst galaxies and xrbs @xcite , and the standard normalization for xrbs ( with @xmath35 ) includes an order - of - magnitude increase in this ratio at the low metallicity expected for high - redshift galaxies @xcite .    while the numerical factor in eq.([eq : ls2 ] ) was derived for x - ray binaries over the range @xmath36 kev @xcite , in this paper we chose a common normalization for soft and hard sources for simplicity . for easier comparison with other work in the literature ,",
    "we list here the luminosities ( for @xmath37 ) in the @xmath38 kev and @xmath39 kev bands , for both the hard and the soft seds : @xmath40 , @xmath41 ; @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "note that in our late eor scenario most of the x - rays that contribute to the cxrb originate near @xmath44 , in the rest - frame frequency range of @xmath45 kev where the corresponding luminosities are @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the early eor scenario ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath48 , _ chandra s _ soft band probes the rest - frame @xmath49 kev range where the luminosities amount to @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "high redshift black holes are expected to be much lighter than the ones observed today in milky way size halos , @xmath52 compared to @xmath53 .",
    "until recently , the early population of high redshift black holes with such small masses was considered purely speculative .",
    "however , the latest observations find black holes with masses in the @xmath54 range in dwarf metal poor galaxies which may resemble the high - redshift environment .",
    "in particular , @xcite used the sloan digital sky survey to find 28 agn in nearby low - mass , low - luminosity dwarf galaxies and estimated the minimum black - hole mass to fall mainly in the @xmath55 range , showing that agn in dwarf galaxies are not as rare as previously thought ; @xcite studied the infrared signature of active nuclei in nearby dwarf galaxies and found black hole masses of @xmath54 ; while @xcite found that relatively many hard x - ray sources in dwarf galaxies are ultra - luminous .",
    "the abundance and brightness of these sources suggest that mini - quasars and high redshift agn may have had a stronger impact on reionization than what is usually assumed .",
    "here we use the internal feedback model for the black hole mass @xcite and follow the discussion in @xcite to model the population of high redshift mini - quasars and their impact on the heating and reionization of the universe .",
    "thus , we find the ratio of the average x - ray luminosity of the central mini - quasar to that of xrbs in the same halo to be @xmath56 where we assumed , as in the case of x - ray binaries , that on average 25% of the mini - quasar x - rays in the relevant wavelengths are not absorbed in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy . here",
    "we needed this non - absorbed fraction in order to compare between xrbs ( for whom ism absorption is implicitly included in the spectrum , which is based on observations ) to mini - quasars ( for which we estimated the intrinsic emitted energy using a theoretical model ) .",
    "we note that , by using the xrb spectrum , we assume ( like @xcite ) that this absorption at high redshifts is similar to that at the low redshifts of the observations . in the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls2 ] ) , @xmath57 parameterizes the uncertainty in the x - ray efficiency of mini - quasars with @xmath58 being its standard value . for simplicity ,",
    "in the rest of this paper we omit the superscript mq when talking about the x - ray efficiency of mini - quasars . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls2 ] ) we can express the x - ray luminosity of a mini - quasar formed in a halo of mass @xmath59 in terms of the star formation rate in the same halo .",
    "compared to xrbs , the x - ray luminosity of a mini - quasar is weighted by an additional factor of @xmath60 .",
    "because of this additional factor , the contribution of mini - quasars to the x - ray background is expected to be negligible compared to that of xrbs at high redshifts ( @xmath61 ) where the typical halo mass is small , but it becomes important at lower redshifts ( @xmath62 ) at which larger halos form bigger black holes .",
    "when mini - quasar emission is modelled as a multi - colour @xcite accretion disc , these sources are expected to have hard seds that are similar to those of xrbs , due to the weak dependence of the x - ray spectrum on the black hole mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the same sed for xrbs and mini - quasars in our calculation .",
    "in this work we rely on the observed intensity of the unresolved cxrb in the @xmath0 kev band as measured by _",
    "chandra _ @xcite to set the maximum possible x - ray efficiency for each type of the considered x - ray sources . following the model developed by @xcite",
    ", we assume the extra - galactic contribution amounts to @xmath63 and is provided solely by the pre - reionization sources .",
    "this normalization gives the maximal value of x - ray efficiency of the high - redshift heating sources that does not violate the observed soft band cxrb .",
    "the values of @xmath21 that we obtain by comparing the simulated background to the observed one are listed in the third column of table  1 for each case of the reionization history and sed specified in the first two columns of the table .",
    "we find that in order to produced the detected unresolved x - ray background , @xmath21 must be 12 orders of magnitude larger than the standard value , @xmath64 , normally assumed in the literature for the efficiency of the high - redshift sources , although even higher values of @xmath21 have been considered @xcite .",
    "we find that hard sources , and in particular mini - quasars , are more efficient in producing the cxrb in the soft band , in that they require an x - ray efficiency that is a factor of a few lower than that of soft sources .",
    "this is because most of the energy emitted by soft x - ray sources redshifts to frequencies much lower than the observed band .",
    "therefore , a high efficiency is needed in that case in order to increase the number of photons that eventually redshift into the relevant energy range . on the other hand , in the case of the hard x - ray sources ( xrbs and mini - quasars ) the sed peaks at @xmath16 kev and , at least for sources at @xmath65 existing just before the end of reionization in our late reionization scenario , the observed @xmath0 kev band probes the energy range around the peak of the sed , and a lower efficiency is sufficient to produce the observed cxrb .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]    along with heating , x - rays partially ionize the neutral medium , competing with the uv photons in powering reionization .",
    "the efficiency of x - rays versus uv in ionizing the cosmic gas depends on the values of the escape fraction and the x - ray efficiency .",
    "here we keep the former parameter fixed in each case by fixing the redshift at which reionization is completed by the uv photons , while varying the latter . in the standard case of @xmath35 ,",
    "the main source of ionization is uv photons while x - rays are expected to yield only a small contribution , ionizing the gas only up to a few percent when reionization is completed by uv . to emphasize this",
    ", we list the level of the partial ionization by x - rays ( within the final remaining neutral regions just before they are reionized ) , @xmath66 , at the end of reionization powered by uv photons , in the fourth column of table 2 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 does not rise above @xmath67 .    on the other hand , with @xmath21 set to its maximum by normalization to the cxrb , the x - ray efficiency is substantially higher and in some cases the x - rays start competing with uv in the quest for reionizing the universe ( see the @xmath66 column in table  1 ) .",
    "partial ionization by x - rays is especially high in the case of the soft spectrum due to the extremely high x - ray efficiency in combination with the rapid , efficient absorption of soft x - rays by neutral gas .",
    "for instance , by the end of the uv reionization it reaches @xmath68 in the case of atomic cooling scenario .",
    "for xrbs and mini - quasars , @xmath66 grows to 13.5% and 10.5% , respectively , by the end of uv reionization ( for the case of atomic cooling and early reionization ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that while uv photons heat and ionize the gas close to the source ( given their very small mean free path within neutral gas ) , x - rays travel larger distances before inputting their energy in the igm . as a result , in the extreme cases with high @xmath21 , reionization is much more homogeneous , and may even proceed outside - in @xcite instead of the conventional inside - out picture @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature of the 21-cm signal , observed with the cmb as a diffuse background source , is expected to be a three - dimensional probe of the high - redshift universe .",
    "current and planned telescopes are designed to measure the redshift evolution of this signal averaged over two - dimensional spheres ( the global spectrum ) as well as its spatial fluctuations at each given epoch which will allow us to extract the power spectrum .",
    "the predicted global spectrum contains information about milestones in the evolution of the universe and for a wide range of models exhibits a prominent absorption trough which single - dish radio telescopes seek to observe .",
    "the sky - averaged brightness temperature reaches its minimal value at the point when heating sources turn on and begin raising the temperature of the igm towards @xmath69 . the power spectrum at each comoving wavenumber , @xmath70 , when plotted as a function of redshift , shows a sequence of peaks driven by various spatially and temporally varying physical quantities ( such as the kinetic gas temperature , fraction of neutral gas , and intensity of ly-@xmath19 radiation ) which determine the intensity of the 21-cm transition .",
    "a generic plot of this type for the 21-cm power spectrum has three peaks @xcite : the high - redshift peak , at @xmath71 , is due to ly-@xmath19 fluctuations ; the mid - redshift peak , which is due to heating fluctuations , appears at @xmath72 , but this peak is not present on scales below the x - ray mean free path @xcite ; and the low - redshift peak , at @xmath73 , is due to ionization fluctuations . of the main targets of the present - day and future radio interferometers .    in figures [ fig:2 ] ( for the late reionization scenario ) and",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( which assumes early reionization ) we plot the global spectrum of the 21-cm signal and its spherically - averaged power spectrum , with the x - ray efficiencies normalized to the cxrb as well as the cases with @xmath37 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 shown for comparison .",
    "the latter case ( which we shown only for the soft sed ) clearly over - produces the observed cxrb , while the case of @xmath76 and late reionization is excluded by the paper observations .",
    "we do show these cases to demonstrate the effect of either extremely strong or absent x - ray heating ( the excluded cases are shown with black lines in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , for the late reionization scenario and hard sed shown in figure [ fig:2 ] we demonstrate the 21-cm signal with the lowest possible x - ray efficiencies ( red dotted lines ) normalized to the current paper limits ( black triangle ) as discussed at the end of section [ sec : cxrb ] .",
    "finally , we plot the expected thermal noise power spectrum of phase 1 of the ska assuming a single beam , an integration time of 1000 hours , and a 10 mhz bandwidth . in the case of global 21-cm experiments , in principle",
    ", short integration times ( minutes ) suffice to detect the signal with a single dish @xcite . in practice , though , the need for accurate calibration and precise removal of the spectrally smooth foreground make these measurements quite difficult , especially given the complex coupling of the errors at different frequencies .",
    "quantitative analyses show that if calibration can remove any sharp frequency response , then it is possible to overcome the issues of a smooth foreground and thermal noise , and global signals such as those we predict in this paper should be detectable @xcite .",
    "we find that the cases of enhanced heating of the igm strongly affect the expected global 21-cm signal .",
    "in particular , because the gas does not have sufficient time to cool down prior to being heated by x - rays , the absorption trough becomes shallower and thus harder to observe , requiring a higher precision of calibration and longer integration times .",
    "for instance , in the case of late reionization and atomic cooling , the minimal brightness temperature is reduced by @xmath77 for a soft sed and @xmath78 for a hard sed .",
    "in addition , the absorption trough is shifted to lower frequencies : from 70 mhz to 60 mhz ( @xmath79 ) in the case of the soft sed , from 74 mhz to 66 mhz ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "finally , with the enhanced heating the emission signal is much stronger and the peak shifts to higher redshifts ; for each model the maximal possible value of the emission signal is realized when the normalization is set so as to produce the full unresolved cxrb .",
    "in particular , in the case of late reionization and atomic cooling , the maximal brightness temperature is boosted by a factor of @xmath14 ( @xmath81 ) for xrbs ( hot gas ) .",
    "see tables 1 and 2 for more information .",
    "as discussed above , x - rays speed up reionization and the intensity of the 21-cm signal drops faster than otherwise expected towards the end of the reionization era , which is most noticeable in the cases with soft x - rays and maximal efficiency ( set to the full cxrb ) , as well as in the excluded case of extreme heating ( with @xmath82 ) where reionization ends considerably earlier than in other models . in addition , ly-@xmath19 photons generated by x - rays in the neutral igm through relaxation of hydrogen atoms excited by primary photoelectrons are boosted by a factor of @xmath21 in each case . for @xmath37",
    "these photons are far less important than ly-@xmath19 directly generated by stars ; however , for @xmath83 the contribution of these two sources becomes comparable . in this case , the 21-cm signal couples to the temperature of the gas @xcite earlier than it would for @xmath84 , which can be seen in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] for the cases with soft x - rays and cxrb normalization as well as the extreme heating case .",
    "one of the striking consequences of the high x - ray efficiency on the power spectrum is that the amplitude of the 21-cm fluctuations is suppressed at high redshifts ( @xmath85 ) , making their detection from this epoch harder .",
    "in particular , the ly-@xmath19 peak at @xmath86 may become unobservable in the case of the soft sed .",
    "this happens mainly because the ly-@xmath19 fluctuations are anti - correlated with fluctuations seeded by inhomogeneous heating ( prior to the heating transition ) , which is partially compensated by the enhanced generation of ly-@xmath19 photons by x - ray excitation of the igm . in most cases , there remains a significant signal from cosmic dawn observable with the ska , even in these worst - case scenarios ( in terms of observing cosmic dawn ) .",
    "comparing the three cases of @xmath37 , @xmath87 and @xmath75 with a soft sed , atomic cooling and late eor , we see that the ly-@xmath19 peak drops from @xmath88 mk@xmath89 at @xmath90 ( @xmath37 ) to @xmath91 mk@xmath89 at @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and to @xmath94 mk@xmath89 at @xmath95 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the effect of x - rays on the heating peak in the 21-cm power spectrum is also dramatic .",
    "the heating peak is lower and is shifted to higher redshifts ( lower frequencies ) when x - rays are strong . in the just - considered case of soft x - rays , atomic cooling and late eor ,",
    "the heating peak drops from @xmath96 mk@xmath89 at @xmath97 ( @xmath37 ) to @xmath98 mk@xmath89 at @xmath99 ( @xmath93 ) to @xmath100 mk@xmath89 at @xmath101 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "thus , when the x - ray sed is soft , the normalization to the full unresolved cxrb yields a lower limit for the amplitude of the ly-@xmath19 and x - ray heating peaks in the 21-cm power spectrum and an upper limit for the redshift at which these peaks are located . in the case of a hard",
    "sed , the main effect of x - rays is to suppress the ly-@xmath19 peak , as the fluctuations in temperature are washed out by the large mean free paths of the x - ray photons and the heating peak is not always present .",
    "the intensity of the 21-cm fluctuations from lower redshifts ( @xmath102 ) depends on both reionization and heating and , thus , is less straightforward to relate to the nature of the x - ray sources . in some cases the fluctuations",
    "are enhanced , because the heating is closer to being saturated during the reionization era ; in others the fluctuations are suppressed as a result of the x - ray contribution to reionization .",
    "heating sources with extremely low x - ray efficiencies do not have enough time to heat the igm before the end of reionization , and in this case the gas remains colder than the cmb even at that time . as a result ,",
    "the absorption trough in the global spectrum is very deep , and the power spectrum features only two peaks sourced by inhomogeneous ly-@xmath19 and ionizing backgrounds .",
    "the latter peak is so strong in the case of @xmath76 that it can be ruled out using current upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum at @xmath103 from paper as we have discussed at the end of section [ sec : cxrb ] .",
    "the minimal possible 21-cm brightness temperature reaches the value of @xmath104 mk ( @xmath105 mk ) at @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) for atomic cooling ( massive halos ) with a late eor and @xmath108 mk ( @xmath109 mk ) at @xmath110 ( 12.8 ) for atomic cooling ( massive halos ) with an early eor .",
    "an intriguing result of our study is that , once available , the 21-cm global signal can be combined with the x - ray background produced by high - redshift sources to put constraints on the sed of these sources . because hard sources are more efficient in seeding the cxrb",
    ", the cxrb limit implies a deeper 21-cm trough ( as the universe is colder ) than is possible in the case of soft x - ray sources .",
    "in particular , focusing on our case of the atomic cooling halos and late eor , we see that given the level of the x - ray background , the absorption trough in the case of xrbs reaches at least @xmath111 mk , which is much deeper than the corresponding limit in the case of the soft x - rays , @xmath112 mk .",
    "therefore , observing a trough shallower than @xmath111 mk would rule out such a population of x - ray sources with a hard sed . in the future , with the direct high - redshift x - ray observations of x - ray surveyor or athena and the observed global 21-cm at hand",
    ", it will be possible to significantly constrain the properties of the high redshift sources even without using any additional information .",
    "this method thus provides an important alternative to probing the nature of x - ray sources with the 21-cm power spectrum @xcite .",
    "moreover , having at hand the cxrb together with both the global 21-cm signal and its power spectrum can help to break degeneracies between x - ray heating and other model parameters .",
    "we leave a more detailed discussion of this to future work .",
    "finally , based on the whole ensemble of models considered here , it is possible to define a border line of the parameter space within which the 21-cm signal can vary without violating any existing observational constraints .",
    "for instance , from the data presented in this paper we see that the absorption trough of the global signal can not be shallower than @xmath113 mk or deeper than @xmath114 mk , and it is located between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "this border line can be used to guide future observations .",
    "because the bank of models presented in this paper is limited , a more detailed discussion of this idea can be found in @xcite and our future work .",
    "the main results of this paper are the consequences of the upper limit on the x - ray efficiency which various high - redshift hard or soft x - ray sources may have without violating the observed soft unresolved x - ray background .",
    "this limits allows us to estimate the maximal effect that early x - ray sources can have on the high - redshift 21-cm signal , reionization , the cmb , and the thermal history of the early universe .",
    "our results are particularly useful in light of the existing and upcoming radio telescopes designed to probe these early epochs .",
    "we find that different types of high - redshift x - ray sources considered here ( i.e. , x - ray binaries , hot gas , or mini - quasars ) naturally produce an x - ray background with a slope close to that of the observed unresolved soft cxrb , which , however , is poorly constrained by present observations . therefore , it is hard to reach strong conclusions about the nature of x - ray sources based on the current measurements of the shape of the cxrb . on the other hand , normalization to the x - ray background",
    "does constrain the maximum possible x - ray efficiency which the high redshift heating sources can have .",
    "hard x - ray sources are more efficient in producing the observed background , compared to the soft sources , and so the maximal x - ray efficiency is typically around 23 times lower for hard sources than for the soft ones .",
    "more generally , the x - ray efficiency that is needed to explain the cxrb is very high compared to what is normally assumed based on low redshift observations .",
    "this allows for a possibility that the high - redshift sources may be more luminous than their low - redshift counterparts . for a population of x - ray sources assumed to have existed down to redshift 6.2 ( and then cut off )",
    ", this enhancement factor varies between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , for the various cases ; for a population that only existed at @xmath119 and above , the factor is in the range @xmath120 .",
    "based on our most extreme case ( the early reionization scenario with massive halos only ) , we can put a realistic upper bound on the bolometric luminosity of the high - redshift sources per star formation rate : @xmath121 for xrbs , @xmath122 in the case of hot gas , and @xmath123 for mini - quasars ( assuming the luminosity - sfr relation of proportionality ) .",
    "interestingly , recent observations suggest that hard x - ray sources such as x - ray binaries or accreting black holes are a factor of @xmath117 more luminous in metal - poor than in solar - metallicity galaxies @xcite . in addition",
    ", x - ray sources in low - redshift dwarf galaxies appear to be ultra - luminous @xcite . however , these trends would have to greatly increase in order to approach the upper bounds that we find .",
    "the possible enhanced heating at high redshift has direct implications for the thermal history and the reionization of the igm as well as for the 21-cm signal produced by neutral hydrogen during and prior to cosmic reionization . in particular",
    ", cosmic heating can happen up to @xmath124 earlier than what is normally assumed .",
    "however , even with the enhanced x - ray emission the saturated heating assumption throughout reionization can only be used with soft sources .",
    "in addition , efficient x - ray sources compete with stellar sources in ionizing the gas . in particular",
    ", x - ray sources with soft spectra can be so efficient as to compete with uv photons in reionizing the universe , producing a fractional increase in the optical depth to cmb photons of @xmath125 . in the cases",
    "when x - rays are so efficient , reionization happens more homogeneously since x - rays have a very long mean free path compared to uv and , thus , ionize the igm far from the sources .",
    "on the other hand , hard sources such as xrbs and mini - quasars ( with their maximal normalization ) have only a mild effect on reionization , producing a fractional increase in the cmb optical depth of only @xmath126 .",
    "thus , in our model reionization is mainly driven by stellar sources which emit uv , while quasars can have a small impact on the eor channeling their energy into hard x - rays .",
    "a different situation was described recently by @xcite who explored a possibility of reionization achieved only by high redshift quasars and other faint , high - redshift agn .",
    "@xcite assigned a composite emissivity to their quasars accounting for a broad spectrum of emitted photons , from optical to hard x - rays @xcite , which resulted in a stronger contribution of agn to reionization .",
    "these authors found that @xmath127 active galaxies can reionize the universe without overproducing the unresolved cxrb at 2 kev ( amounting to @xmath128 of the cxrb ) provided their properties are similar to those of their lower redshift counterparts .",
    "the contribution of high redshift quasars in this case was normalized by fitting the observed integrated optical emissivity at redshifts up to @xmath129 @xcite and extrapolating this result to higher redshifts out to @xmath130 .",
    "this emissivity drops slowly with redshift , predicting a significant population of quasars at early times .",
    "based as it is on the extrapolation of current scarce high - redshift observations , this result may overestimate the role of quasars and agn in reionization .",
    "an important implication of the possible high x - ray efficiency of the early x - ray sources is the signature that they imprint in the 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen .",
    "this signal has not been detected yet , and its discovery is a major goal of the astronomical community . since the agents of high - redshift cosmic heating are highly unconstrained , a wide space of possibilities is left for the 21-cm signal , which translates into a wide parameter space for telescopes to search . having an upper limit on the effects of cosmic heating naturally constrains the search parameter space and can help guide telescope design and search strategies .",
    "an upper limit on heating has important implications both for the global spectrum and for the spatial fluctuations of the 21-cm signal .    in the case of a high x - ray efficiency ,",
    "the absorption trough of the global 21-cm signal is significantly reduced and shifted towards lower frequencies ( higher redshifts ) , while the reionization gradient ( in emission ) is extended over a broader range of frequencies .",
    "the 21-cm power spectrum is suppressed at high redshifts ( @xmath131 ) due to the enhanced heating , and the ly-@xmath19 peak is reduced and shifted to lower frequencies as well as the x - ray peak ( if present ) ; however , the fluctuations from the second half of reionization are maintained and sometimes boosted due to the effect of saturated heating .",
    "thus , there is mixed news for 21-cm experiments . for global experiments ,",
    "the expected signal from reionization and cosmic dawn is bounded and for some models can be significantly reduced . for phase 1 of the ska , reionization remains observable at a high signal - to - noise ratio in all cases , but cosmic dawn can become difficult to observe in the most extreme cases .",
    "we note that in our calculation we do not account for exotic processes , such as dark matter annihilation , which could heat up the gas early on and suppress the 21-cm signal without leaving any x - ray background .    for completeness",
    ", we have also considered lower limits on the x - ray heating efficiency for late reionization scenarios ( which do not end before @xmath132 ) using recent upper limit found by paper .",
    "weak or no x - ray heating results in a 21-cm signal with a deep absorption trough in the global signal and strong fluctuations from all the epochs that normally have a signal that is suppressed due to cosmic heating .",
    "such a signal should be an easy target for radio telescopes .    to summarize , the unknown details of star formation , the process of reionization and the nature of high - redshift x - ray sources , including their sed and x - ray efficiency , result in a large uncertainty in the expected 21-cm signal .",
    "specifically , the absorption trough , the main feature of the global 21-cm signal , can vary in depth anywhere from @xmath133  mk to @xmath113  mk , and in position from @xmath134 to 24 ; the fluctuation peak from mid - reionization is still unconstrained to better than the range of 3 - 3000  mk@xmath89 at @xmath135 mpc@xmath136 ; the x - ray peak strongly depends on the properties of the x - ray sources and can be strong , mild or vanishing ; finally , the strength of the fluctuation peak from the ly-@xmath19 coupling era varies between 2 and 200  mk@xmath89 and its redshift lies within @xmath137 .",
    "while the cxrb narrows the possible realization space of the 21-cm background only slightly at present , future x - ray missions such as athena and x - ray surveyor could directly probe high redshift sources of x - rays , constraining their effect on the intergalactic gas and the 21-cm signal .",
