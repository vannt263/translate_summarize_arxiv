    "recent progress in synthesizing materials that contain ferromagnetic chains@xcite provides new opportunities to study the quantum dynamics of atomic - size domain walls ( dw ) . on the atomic level ,",
    "a dw is a structure that is stable with respect to ( quantum ) fluctuations , separating two regions with opposite magnetization .",
    "such a structure was observed in the one - dimensional cocl@xmath2h@xmath3o chaintorrance69,nicoli74 .    in an earlier paper@xcite",
    ", we studied the propagation of spin waves in ferromagnetic quantum spin chains that support dws .",
    "we demonstrated that dws are very stable against perturbations , and that the longitudinal component of the spin wave speeds up when it passes through a dw while the transverse component is almost completely reflected .    in this paper , we focus on the dynamic stability of the dw in the heisenberg - ising ferromagnetic chain .",
    "it is known that the ground state of this model in the subspace of total magnetization zero supports dw structures@xcite . however",
    ", if we let the system evolve in time from an initial state with a dw structure and this initial state is not an eigenstate , it must contain some excited states .",
    "therefore , the question whether the dw structure will survive in the stationary ( long - time ) regime is nontrivial .",
    "the question how the dw structure dynamically survives in the stationary ( long - time ) region is an interesting problem . in particular , we focus on the stability of the dw with respect to the dynamical ( quantum ) fluctuations as we approach the quantum critical point ( from heisenberg - ising like to heisenberg ) .",
    "we show that the critical quantum dynamics of dws can be described well in terms of conventional power laws .",
    "the behavior of quantum systems at or near a quantum critical point is of contemporary interestsachdev99 .",
    "we also show that the dw profiles rapidly become very stable as we move away from the quantum critical point .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given bymike91,cloizeaux66,gochev77,gochev83,matt81 @xmath4 where @xmath5 indicates the total number of spins in the spin chain , and the exchange integrals @xmath6 and @xmath7 determine the strength of the interaction between the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 components of spin @xmath0 operators @xmath11 .",
    "here we only consider the system with the ferromagnetic ( @xmath12 ) nearest exchange interaction .",
    "it is well known that @xmath13 is a quantum critical point of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) , that is , the analytical expressions of the ground state energy for @xmath14 and @xmath15 are different and singular at the points @xmath16cloizeaux66",
    ".    in ref.@xcite gochev constructed a stable state with dw structure in both the classical and quantum treatments of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) . in the classical treatment , gochev replaces the spin operators in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) by classical vectors of length @xmath17 @xmath18and then uses the conditions @xmath19 and @xmath20 to find the ground state . in the ground state",

    "the corresponding energy is @xmath25 in the quantum mechanical treatment , gochev first constructs the eigenfunction of a bound state of @xmath26 magnons@xcite @xmath27where @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30and the corresponding energy is given by@xcite @xmath31then he demonstrated that for the infinite chain , the linear superposition @xmath32 \\right\\ } \\left\\vert \\psi _ { n_{0}+i}\\right\\rangle ,   \\label{magnon2}\\]]where @xmath33@xmath34 ^{2}\\right\\ } , \\]]is the quantum analog of the classical domain wall , in which @xmath35 are given in eq .",
    "( [ szsx ] ) , and the energy coincides with eq .",
    "( [ edw ] ) .",
    "gochev s work confirmed the existence of the dw structures in the one - dimensional ferromagnetic quantum spin @xmath0 chain . in the infinite chain , the exact quantum analog of classical dw",
    "is represented by @xmath36 . in the finite chain ,",
    "the dw structure exists as a bound @xmath26-magnon state @xmath37 .",
    "the main difference between these two states is the distribution of magnetization in the xy plane . in the infinite chain ,",
    "the change of the magnetization occurs in three dimensions , according to eq .",
    "( [ szsx ] ) , but in the finite chain @xmath38 for all spins .",
    "now we consider @xmath39 of the bound state @xmath40 in the case that the number of flipped spin is half of the total spins , i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath5 is an even number .",
    "even though the formal expression for @xmath40 is known , the expression for @xmath39 in this state ( for finite and infinite chains ) is not known . for finite @xmath5 , the ground state in the subspace of total magnetization @xmath42",
    "can , in principle , be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ magnon ] ) .",
    "however , this requires a numerical procedure and we loose the attractive features of the analytical approach .",
    "indeed , it is more efficient to use a numerical method and compute directly the ground state in the subspace of total magnetization @xmath42 . in fig .",
    "figure0 , we show some representative results as obtained by the power method@xcite for a chain of @xmath43 spins . in all cases ,",
    "the domain wall is well - defined . obviously , because we are considering the system in the ground state , the magnetization profile will not change during the time evolution .    to inject a dw in the spin chain , we take the state @xmath44 with the left half of the spins up and the other half down as the initial state ( see fig . [ figure1](a ) for @xmath43 ) .",
    "the state @xmath44 corresponds to the state with the largest weight in the bound state @xmath45 with @xmath41 , because @xmath46 reaches the maximum if @xmath47 for all @xmath48 ( note @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath44 is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "the energy of @xmath50 , relative to the ferromagnetic ground state , is @xmath51 , and its spread @xmath52 . in table",
    "[ tablea ] , we list some representative values of the energy in the initial state ( see fig . [ figure1](a ) ) and in the ground state of subspace @xmath42 ( see fig . [ figure0 ] ) .",
    "a priori , there is no reason why the dw of the initial state @xmath44 should relax to a dw profile that is dynamically stable . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the difference between energy of the initial state and the ground state energies for @xmath54 is relatively large and the relative spread in energy ( @xmath55 ) is large also , suggesting that near the quantum critical point , the initial state may contain a significant amount of excited states .",
    "therefore , it is not evident that a dw structure will survive in the long - time regime .",
    "in fact , from the numbers in table i , one can not predict whether or not the dw will be stable .",
    "for instance , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the dw is not dynamically stable whereas for @xmath58 it is stable but the energies ( see first line in table i ) do not give a clue as to why this should be the case . on the other hand , by solving the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , it is easy to see if the dw is dynamically stable or not .",
    ".the energy @xmath59 of the initial state @xmath60 ( see fig . [ figure1](a ) ) and the ground state @xmath61 in the @xmath42 subspace , both relative to the ground state energy of the ferromagnet . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next we introduce a definition of the dw width . from eq .",
    "( [ sznfit ] ) , we can find @xmath62 and @xmath63 which satisfy @xmath64that is , when @xmath65 equals half of its maximum value ( @xmath0 ) . here",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are not necessarily integer numbers .",
    "now we can define the dw width @xmath66 as the distance between @xmath62 and @xmath63 : @xmath67    clearly , the width of the dw becomes ill - defined if it approaches the size of the chain . on the other hand , the computational resources ( mainly memory ) , required to solve the tdse , grow exponentially with the number of spins in the chain .",
    "these two factors severely limit the minimum difference between @xmath68 and the quantum critical point ( @xmath69 ) that yields meaningful results for the width of the dw . indeed , for fixed @xmath5 , @xmath70 has to be larger than the `` effective '' critical value for the finite system in order for the dw width to be smaller than the system size .",
    "although the system sizes that are amenable to numerical simulation are rather small for present - day `` classical statistical mechanics '' standards , it is nevertheless possible to extract from these simulations useful information about the quantum critical behavior of the dynamically stable dw .    in fig .",

    "( [ h1 ] ) , the magnetization of each spin will fluctuate and @xmath105 .",
    "if , after long time , the system relaxes to a stationary state that contains a dw , the magnetization of each spin will fluctuate around its stationary value @xmath100 .",
    "the fluctuations are given by @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath106 is large , the difference between the actual magnetization profile at time @xmath107 and the stationary profile @xmath100 may be large . from eq .",

    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "as expected , the distribution of @xmath108 is symmetric about the centre of the spin chain ( @xmath110 ) .",

    "this means that the quantum fluctuations of these spins become smaller if we increase the value of @xmath68 .",
    "this is reasonable because with increasing @xmath68 , the initial state approaches an eigenstate of the hamiltonian for which @xmath113 ( ising limit ) .",
    "\\2 ) for the spins at the dw centre , i.e. , @xmath114 , when @xmath68 becomes larger and larger , @xmath93 first increases and then decreases . qualitatively , this can be understood in the following way .",
    "when @xmath68 is close to @xmath115 , the magnetization at the dw centre disappears very fast and remains zero .",
    "however , if @xmath116 , the magnetization at the dw centre will retain its initial direction , hence the behavior of  the spin at the dw centre will qualitatively change as @xmath68 moves away from the critical point @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we plot @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath118 first increases as @xmath68 increases , reaches its maximum at @xmath120 , and then decreases as @xmath68 becomes larger .",
    "now we consider the @xmath111-dependence of @xmath93 for fixed @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath93 is a symmetric function of @xmath111 , we may consider only one side of the whole chain , e.g. , the spins with @xmath121 . from fig.[figure4 ] , according to the value of @xmath68 , there are three different regions :    \\1 ) @xmath122 : starting from the boundary ( @xmath123 ) , @xmath124 first decreases , then increases , and finally decreases again as @xmath111 approaches the dw centre ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "as we discussed already , the fluctuation of the magnetization at the dw centre is small when @xmath68 is close to @xmath115 .",
    "the spin at the boundary only interacts with one nearest spin , so it has more freedom to fluctuate . for the others , because of the influence of the dw structure ( or boundary ) , the fluctuations of the spins which are near the dw ( or near the boundary ) are larger compared to those of a spin located in the middle of a polarized region .",
    "thus @xmath93 is larger if the spin is located near the dw or near a boundary .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath126 : @xmath93 reaches its maximum at the dw centre .",
