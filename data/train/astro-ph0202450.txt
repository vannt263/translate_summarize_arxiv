    "a core - collapse supernova explosion produces a number of neutrinos and 99% of the gravitational energy is transformed to neutrinos .",
    "it is generally believed that the core - collapse supernova explosions have traced the star formation history in the universe and have emitted a great number of neutrinos , which should make a diffuse background .",
    "this supernova relic neutrino ( srn ) background is one of the targets of the currently working large neutrino detectors , superkamiokande ( sk ) and sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) .",
    "comparing the predicted srn spectrum with the observations by these detectors provides us potentially valuable information on the nature of neutrinos as well as the star formation history in the universe .",
    "this srn background has been discussed in a number of previous papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the work after totani et al .",
    "@xcite takes into account the realistic star formation history inferred from various observations and theoretical modeling of galaxy formation , to calculate the srn flux .",
    "totani et al.@xcite calculated the energy flux of srn at sk detector and compared it with neutrinos emitted by other sources ( solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrinos and so on ) .",
    "then they concluded that the visible event rate of srn at sk is 1.2 yr@xmath3 in the energy range from 15 to 40 mev . on the other hand , kaplinghat et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the upper limit of srn and discussed the possibility of the detection at sk detector comparing to the other backgrounds .",
    "their result is that at the energy range from 15 to 40 mev , where no significant background had been considered to exist in previous studies , there is a huge background of the invisible muon decay and the detection of srn is difficult .",
    "they also discussed the effects of neutrino oscillation and briefly mentioned that _ if _ the srn flux is in the vicinity of their upper bound and all three flavors are maximally mixed , it may be detectable as a distortion of the expected muon background .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the srn flux and the event rate at sk , and discuss about the detectability of srn , with the following new aspects compared with previous studies : 1 ) realistic neutrino oscillation parameters are incorporated based on the recent solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , 2 ) a realistic neutrino spectrum from one supernova explosion is used , which is obtained from a numerical simulation by the lawrence livermore group , and 3 ) we have examined other contaminating background events against the detection of srn , in more detail than previous studies .",
    "recent experiments of sk and sno support neutrino oscillation by solar @xcite-@xcite and atmospheric neutrino @xcite data .",
    "although some previous studies ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) mentioned the possibility of neutrino oscillation , no quantitative calculation of srn has been made incorporating the realistic oscillation parameters .",
    "here we consider four neutrino oscillation models , which satisfy the solar and atmospheric neutrino data , and investigate the dependence of the positron spectra at sk on the oscillation models .",
    "if neutrino oscillation occurs , @xmath4 s are converted into @xmath5 s which are mainly detected at sk detector . because @xmath4 s interact with matter only through the neutral - current reactions in supernovae , they are weakly coupled with matter compared to @xmath5 .",
    "thus the neutrino sphere of @xmath4 s is deeper in the core than @xmath5 s and their temperatures are higher than @xmath5 s .",
    "therefore neutrino oscillation enhances the mean @xmath5 s energy and enhances event rate at sk detector .    in all of the past studies ,",
    "neutrinos emitted from a supernova are assumed to obey the fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential .",
    "however , since neutrinos are not in the thermal equilibrium states in supernovae , the real spectrum should be different from the pure fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "thus we use in this paper a realistic supernova model established by the lawrence livermore group @xcite which in fact shows clear difference from the fermi - dirac distribution @xcite .",
    "there are several background events which hinder the detection of srn .",
    "these includes atmospheric and solar neutrinos , anti - neutrinos from nuclear reactors , and decay electrons from invisible muons",
    ". we should find the energy region which is not contaminated by these background events and then calculate the detectable event rate of srn . by careful examination of these events , we found that there is a narrow energy window at which the detection of the srn event might be possible .",
    "in addition we use three models of the cosmic star formation history , i.e. , the evolution of star formation rate ( sfr ) density of high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is inferred from several star formation indicators such as rest - frame uv luminosity , h@xmath6 lines , or dust emission in far - infrared or submillimeter wavebands .",
    "it should be noted that sfr models contain various uncertainties , especially at high redshift regions .",
    "( _ e.g. _ , the faint ends of luminosity functions have not been well established at high redshifts and the uncertainties in dust extinction are large at all redshifts @xcite . )",
    "this is the reason we applied several sfr evolution models described below .    throughout this paper",
    ", we consider only electron antineutrinos ( @xmath5 s ) from collapse - driven supernovae , because @xmath5 s are most easily detected in a water herenkov detector like sk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : models ] , we illustrate the neutrino oscillation models , the supernova model , and the supernova rate models considered in this paper and discuss about these models .",
    "formulations for calculation of flux and event rate at sk are given in section [ sec : formulation ] . in section [ sec : results ] , we show the calculated flux and event rate .",
    "detailed discussions especially on other background events are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use a realistic model of a collapse - driven supernova calculated by the lawrence livermore group @xcite .",
    "we show in fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum ] the time - integrated spectrum for @xmath5 s ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite for detail ) .",
    "we also show the fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution with zero chemical potential for comparison . comparing with the fd model used in the other studies ,",
    "the deficit of both low- and high - energy neutrinos can be seen .    in this paper , we assume that this numerical model represents all of the past supernovae , although in this model the progenitor of the supernova has been assumed to have the mass of @xmath7 .",
    "it is clearly an oversimplification , but we note that the mean mass of progenitor stars of type ii supernovae ( above @xmath8 ) weighted by number is about @xmath9 when a typical initial mass function is applied @xcite .",
    "another assumption made in the simulation is the isotropic radiation of neutrinos .",
    "all supernova progenitors are rotating , and it may have significant effect on the degree of isotropy of neutrino emission @xcite , although the effect is very difficult to estimate quantitatively . however , since our interest is in the srn background , which is the sum of all past supernova neutrinos , the rotation effect is expected to be small .",
    "we adopt the four parameter sets for the neutrino mixing ( see table [ table : parameter ] ) and the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "these parameter sets are introduced to explain the observations of the solar and the atmospheric neutrinos @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the neutrino spectra emitted by each supernova are calculated numerically by takahashi et al .",
    "@xcite for the same parameter sets assuming the normal mass hierarchy .",

    "recent sk and sno observations @xcite show that lma solution are more favorable but sma solution can not be rejected at more than @xmath10 level ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore we try the sma solution as well .",
    "the suffixes `` -l '' and `` -s '' indicate whether @xmath11 is large or small .",
    "a large ( small ) @xmath11 means `` higher resonance '' is adiabatic ( nonadiabatic ) .",

    ". the lower resonance point is at lower density , and the higher resonance point at higher density . )",
    "the adiabatic higher resonance enhances the energy of the electron neutrinos and enhances the event rate of @xmath12 scattering , but does not affect the electron anti - neutrinos @xcite . in this paper , since we deal with only the reaction of @xmath5 s , this `` -l '' and `` -s '' hardly influence the result .",
    "now , we semi - qualitatively present a simple illustration of the expected spectral shape of @xmath5 s for lma and sma models .",
    "we can naively deal with anti - neutrino oscillation effect as vacuum oscillation , since @xmath5 s are not affected by the resonance .",

    "this equation shows that in lma models the @xmath5 flux at higher energy region is enhanced , on the other hand that at lower energy region is suppressed , because the original mean @xmath19 s energy is higher than that of @xmath5 s as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "however , in the case of the inverted hierarchy , this situation changes dramatically although we do not give calculation for this case . in this case",
    ", the higher resonance point is in the anti - neutrino sector @xcite , and hence resonant conversion of @xmath5 s and @xmath4 s is possible .",
    "the conversion probability would be dependent on the neutrino energy .",
    "another possibility of such resonant conversion effect is the spin - flip oscillation of @xmath5 s by a flavor - changing neutrino magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have modeled the expected evolution of the cosmic sfr with redshift .",
    "the cosmic sfr can now be traced to @xmath20 observationally , although some details remain controversial .",
    "we use three sfrs per unit comoving volume which are also used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all of them are derived following the same method employed by madau et al .",
    "@xcite first .",
    "they use the intergalactic absorption to identify high redshift galaxies in broadband multicolor survey , and convert the uv luminosity to sfr and the metal ejection rate assuming a typical initial mass function ( imf ) of stars .",
    "the supernova rate is expected to be proportional to sfr since the lifetime of progenitors of core - collapse supernovae is much shorter than the cosmological time scale .",
    "we show in fig .",

    "this sfr increases rapidly between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , peaks between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and gently declines at higher redshifts .",
    "this includes an upward correction for dust reddening of @xmath27 mag .",
    "the original sfr ( before correction ) should be interpreted as lower limits to the real values , since a significant fraction of uv light from young stars could be absorbed and re - emitted in far - infrared band . in the second model ,",
    "the sfr remains instead roughly constant at @xmath28 ( sf2 ) @xcite , as : @xmath29 we should consider sf2 in addition to sf1 , because of the uncertainties associated with the incompleteness of the data sets and the amount of dust extinction at early epochs .",
    "the third sfr ( sf3 ) @xcite , @xmath30 represents even more star formation at early epochs .",
    "this sfr is based on the studies which suggest that the evolution of the sfr up to @xmath31 may have been overestimated @xcite , while the rates at high-@xmath32 may have been severely underestimated due to large amounts of dust extinction @xcite .",
    "these sfr evolutions should change when a different cosmological model is assumed , since they are based on the observed data of high-@xmath32 galaxies .",
    "the correction to other cosmological models can be written as ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath33    to obtain the supernova rate ( @xmath34 ) , we multiply the sfrs by the coefficient @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the salpeter imf ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 is the stellar mass in solar units @xcite .",
    "( here , we assume that all stars whose mass is greater than @xmath39 explode as core - collapse supernovae . )",
    "this resulting rates agree with the local observed value .",
    "we label these models `` sn1 '' , `` sn2 '' , and `` sn3 '' , respectively .",
    "in section 2 , we calculated the number of emitted @xmath5 s from a supernova per unit energy @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and supernova rate , @xmath34 .",
    "we remark that @xmath42 is supernova rate per comoving volume , and hence we should multiply the factor @xmath43 to obtain the rate per physical volume at that time .",
    "the present number density of @xmath5 s , whose energy is in the interval of the @xmath44 , emitted in the interval of the redshift @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where the factor @xmath47 comes from the expansion of the universe .",
    "the friedmann equation gives the relation between @xmath48 and @xmath32 as follows : @xmath49    we now obtain the differential number flux of srn , @xmath50 , using the relation @xmath51 $ ] : @xmath52 where we assume that gravitational collapses began at the redshift parameter @xmath53 .",
    "it can be seen that , from equations ( [ eq : sf ] ) and ( [ eq : flux_cal ] ) , the flux does not depend on the cosmological parameters such as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the flux depend on these parameters .",
    "the illustration of this difference is as follows : totani et al .",
    "used supernova rate evolution derived from their theoretical model of galaxy evolution which reproduces various properties of present - day galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "our supernova rate is based on the observational estimate of luminosity densities of high-@xmath32 galaxies , and the dependence of the cosmological volume element on the parameters such as @xmath56 and @xmath57 is cancelled out .",
    "therefore , our supernova rate depends on the cosmological parameters while the neutrino flux does not depend on them .",
    "we calculate the flux of the srn using the formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux_cal ] ) for various models . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_sn ] , the flux for the three supernova rate models are shown assuming no oscillation model .",
    "the fluxes of these models are almost the same above @xmath58 mev and the models with more sfr at early epochs have a higher peak at lower neutrino energy .",
    "these properties come from the following effects : the energy of neutrinos which were emitted at redshift @xmath32 is reduced by a factor @xmath59 when we observe",
    ". then at observation , the high energy tail ( @xmath60 ) is mainly contributed by low redshift supernovae . since at low redshift three supernova rate models are almost the same , the fluxes at @xmath61 are not much different . similarly",
    ", because high redshift supernova neutrinos contribute more at low energy region when we observe , we can see model dependence at low energy clearly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux_osci ] , we show the flux of various neutrino oscillation models assuming sn1 model . in sma and",
    "no oscillation models we can see higher peak around @xmath62 mev than in lma models , because in lma models the low energy @xmath5 s are deficit due to the conversion into @xmath4 s . but above @xmath63 mev , in lma models we can see more flux , because @xmath4 s which have higher mean energy at production have more changed into @xmath5 s than in the case of sma or no oscillation .",
    "( see also qualitative explanation in section [ subsec : osci ] . )",
    "integrated flux over the entire neutrino energy range is shown in table [ table : flux ] .      the sk detector is a water erenkov detector whose fiducial mass is 22,500 ton .",
    "the detector efficiency is 100@xmath64 for electrons ( positrons ) whose energy is above 5 mev , and 50@xmath64 at 4.2 mev .",
    "we only consider the reaction @xmath65 , because the cross section [ @xmath66 @xcite ] is much larger than the other reactions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : event_sn ] , the event rate at sk of the three supernova rate models are shown assuming no oscillation model .",
    "because of the detector threshold , we see only the positrons whose energies are above @xmath62 mev , so that the differences between models are small as shown also in fig . [ fig : flux_sn ] where the model dependence is also small for neutrinos above @xmath67 mev .",
    "then , although our three supernova rate models have very different properties at high redshift regions , our results are not influenced by the behavior of sfrs at those high @xmath32 regions .",
    "( these results are hardly changed when we assume the other lma or sma models , instead of the no oscillation model . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : event_osci ] , we show the event rate of various neutrino oscillation models assuming sn1 model .",
    "we can see clear difference of the lma model from sma or no oscillation models , especially at the high energy tail .",
    "this property results from the flux dependence on oscillation models ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : flux_osci ] ) .    as a result ,",
    "if we can detect srn events above @xmath68 mev , we can discriminate the lma model from the sma or no oscillation models in any supernova rate models and any sets of cosmological parameters .",
    "we discuss in this subsection about neutrinos from other sources which may become an obstacle to the srn detection .",
    "they are atmospheric and solar neutrinos , anti - neutrinos from nuclear reactors , and decay electrons from invisible muons .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : background ] the number flux of srn and these background events , and we discuss the each background event below .",
    "the flux of the atmospheric neutrinos is usually calculated using monte carlo method including various relevant effects ( flux of primary cosmic rays , solar modulation , geomagnetic field , interaction of cosmic rays in the air , and so on ) , and in that simulation one - dimensional approximation is used , i.e. , after the interaction of primary cosmic ray particles with air nuclei , all the particles are assumed to be moving along the line of the momentum vector of the primary cosmic ray particles @xcite .",
    "( recently preliminary results of three - dimensional flux calculations have been reported @xcite . )",
    "there are many authors who calculated the atmospheric neutrino flux ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent result ) .",
    "we use in this paper the flux calculated by gaisser et al .",
    "@xcite and barr et al .",
    "although their calculations are rather old , the fluxes of low energy neutrinos , in which we are interested , are also calculated , while most of other papers show only higher energy region ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "solar neutrino flux is dominant at energy range 1020 mev .",
    "we use the flux predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : background ] @xcite .",
    "since the solar neutrinos are not @xmath5 s but @xmath12 s , the cross section for solar neutrinos is about two order smaller than that for @xmath5 s .",
    "furthermore recoil electrons scattered by solar neutrinos strongly concentrate to the opposite direction of the sun , in contrast to the isotropic distribution of @xmath5 events .",
    "therefore the solar neutrino is an avoidable background .",
    "in fact , we can demonstrate how we can avoid the solar neutrino background , as follows .",
    "the solar neutrino event number is about @xmath70 @xmath71 @xcite , about 3 or 4 orders of magnitude larger than our expected event rate @xmath72 @xmath71 .",
    "the recoil electrons scatter obeying the gaussian of one - sigma error @xmath73 for 10 mev electrons @xcite .",
    "then , 99.98% of solar neutrino events within @xmath74 ( corresponding to @xmath75 ) can be avoided .",
    "therefore , restricting our discussion on the nearby side of the hemisphere from the sun , we can ignore the solar neutrino events .    the third background which we must consider is anti - neutrinos from nuclear reactors .",
    "in each nuclear reactor , almost all the power comes from the fissions of the four isotopes , @xmath76u ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78u ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80pu ( @xmath81 ) , and @xmath82pu ( @xmath83 ) @xcite .",
    "each isotope produces a unique electron anti - neutrino spectrum through the decay of its fission fragments and their daughters .",
    "the @xmath5 spectrum from @xmath76u , @xmath80pu , and @xmath82pu can be derived using the semi - empirical formula with which we fit data of detected @xmath84-spectrum from fission by thermal neutrons @xcite .",
    "( @xmath78u undergoes only fast neutron fission and hence electron spectrum from @xmath78u can not by measured by this kind of experiment . ) above 7 mev , the number of @xmath84 counts drops dramatically and fitting error becomes large .",
    "in addition , with this method , as we determine the maximum @xmath84 energy and derives the energy distribution below that energy , it is difficult to estimate the errors on the high energy range @xcite . while the @xmath5 spectra in ref .",
    "@xcite are given as tables , we use for simplicity somewhat less accurate analytical approximation given in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a normalization factor",
    "we use energy - integrated @xmath5 flux at kamioka , @xmath85 , which are the summation of the flux from various nuclear reactors in japan and korea @xcite .",
    "this fit is not valid above @xmath58 mev .",
    "however , there is an estimation that we would get few ( 10 or less ) events per year above 10 mev from reactors@xcite .    with three backgrounds we discussed above ,",
    "we expect the energy window of srn events opening from 10 mev to 27 mev .",

    "@xcite electrons or positrons from invisible muons are the largest background in the energy window from 19 to 35 mev . this invisible muon event is illustrated as follows .",
    "the atmospheric neutrinos produce muons by interaction with the nucleons ( both free and bound ) in the fiducial volume .",
    "if these muons are produced with energies below herenkov radiation threshold ( kinetic energy less than 53 mev ) , then they will not be detected ( `` invisible muons '' ) , but their decay - produced electrons and positrons will be . since the muon decay signal will mimic the @xmath86 process in sk , it is difficult to distinguish srn from these events .",
    "the energy spectrum of this invisible muon events is obtained by the stopped muon decay spectrum @xmath87 ( michel spectrum @xcite ) , where @xmath88 is the fermi constant , @xmath89 the muon mass , and @xmath90 the electron ( positron ) energy .",
    "this equation is valid for @xmath91 . from the observation of kamiokande ii detector the estimated event rate from these muon decays",

    "we conclude that there is no energy window of srn .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have found that there is no energy region where srn is dominant .",
