    "@xmath2 seconds in the form of gamma - ray emissions , and they show violent time variabilities in their emissions ( @xmath3 ) . although the central engine of grbs is totally hidden from our view , according to their enormous power , it is often argued that relativistic phenomena should be involved .",
    "the most popular model for the central engines of grbs is a hyperaccreting black hole model ( narayan et al .",
    "1992 , 2001 ) . in this model ,",
    "the energy of relativistic jets that makes intense gamma - ray emissions is produced via the accretion of a massive disk ( @xmath4 ) onto a stellar - mass black hole .",
    "such systems are expected after several energetic phenomena such as mergers of double neutron star binaries ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 ) , neutron star / black hole binaries ( paczyski 1991 ) , white dwarf / black hole binaries ( fryer et al .",
    "1999 ) , black hole / he star binaries ( fryer & woosley 1998 ) , and failed supernovae ( or collapsars ; woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . their mass accretion rate is supposed to be as high as @xmath5 , and then the accretion flows become so optically thick that photons are almost trapped in the flows . therefore radiative cooling is not efficient in this case . alternatively , since the density and temperature can become very high ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , the cooling via thermal neutrino emissions will become efficient .",
    "such disks ( or flows ) are called `` neutrino - dominated accretion flows '' ( ndafs ) .",
    "this neutrino emissions may provide the energy deposition enough to making relativistic jet by neutrino annihilation above the disk ( popham et al .",
    "the steady structure of ndafs has been studied by many authors ( popham et al .",

    "2004 , 2007 ; masada et al . 2007 ) .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the structure and stability of ndafs by taking into account the convective energy transfer in the vertical direction , which has not been considered in detail in the previous studies . in the context of standard accretion disks which is",
    "radiation pressure - dominated , some authors have inferred the importance of vertical convective motions ( bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ; shakura et al .",
    "1978 ; milsom et al .",
    "1994 ; blaes & socrates 2001 ; sadowski et al . 2011 ) and some recent studies have shown the importance of convective motions in the hyperaccretion flows ( milosavljevic et al .",
    "2010 ; sekiguchi & shibata 2010 ) . due to the vertical convection , the internal energy stored in the gas",
    "would not be advected inward but transported upward , which alters the equation of energy conservation .",
    "we present the equilibrium solutions of convective ndafs , discuss their stability , and propose the new scenario for the evolution of ndafs that can account for the violent time variability in the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "in the following discussion , we adopt equations describing the steady structure of a hyperaccretion disk based on newtonian gravity . angular velocity of gas particles can be approximated as keplerian : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "expressions for mass conservation , angular momentum conservation , hydrostatic balance and @xmath10-viscosity are given , respectively ,    @xmath11 , \\label{angmom } \\\\",
    "\\frac{p}{\\rho}&=&\\omega(r)^2 h^2 , \\label{hydrostat } \\\\",
    "\\rho \\nu r\\frac{d\\omega}{dr}&=&-\\alpha p , \\label{alphavis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the radial velocity , surface mass density , kinematic viscosity coefficient , pressure and scale height of the accretion disk , respectively ; @xmath17 and @xmath10 are the mass accretion rate and viscosity parameter . here",
    "the pressure @xmath15 is composed of three terms : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the radiation pressure , the gas pressure , the pressure of the degenerate particles , respectively ( for their mathematical description see section 2.1 of km02 ) .",
    "we set inner radius of the accretion disk , @xmath22 to be the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "in addition , we should consider the equation of energy conservation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the viscous heating rate and neutrino cooling rate per unit surface area .",
    "as for the right hand side , the energy dissipation rate per unit surface area can be described as @xmath28 and the neutrino cooling rate @xmath29 is composed of four terms : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the neutrino emissivity due to the electron / positron capture by a nucleon @xmath35 , due to the electron - positron pair annihilation , due to the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , and the plasmon decay , respectively ( see section 2.3 of kohri et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the left hand side is often called as the advective cooling rate : @xmath36 which means the inward flux of the gas energy along the flow . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the entropy per unit mass , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the entropy density of the radiation and the gas , respectively ( see section 2.3 of km02 ) . in the following discussions",
    ", we approximated @xmath41 as @xmath42 , and define the total cooling rate as @xmath43 .",
    "it would be obvious that the radiative cooling is negligible .    in order to see effects of convection in an hyperaccretion disk",
    ", we should estimate a typical timescale for the convective motion of the blob in the vertical direction @xmath44 and compare it with timescale for the inward advection @xmath45 .",
    "the acceleration of the blob in the accretion disk due to the vertical buoyancy would be the same order of magnitude as that due to the gravitational force , i.e. @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vertical coordinate measured from the equatorial plane .",
    "then the convective speed along the vertical direction comming from @xmath48 should be @xmath49 and then the timescale for the blob which is emerged at @xmath50 and transported convectively can be estimated as @xmath51    on the other hand , advection timescale can be estimated as @xmath52 here we concentrate on cases with @xmath53 . according to km02",
    ", such an accretion disk is very optically thick with respect of photons and not so dense or hot enough to emit neutrinos efficiently .",
    "however , when the convection timescale is shorter than the advection timescale , the energy dissipated in the accretion flow would not be advected radially inward , but would be convected upward , and as a result the gas at a certain radius would be heated more efficiently than in the case without convection .",
    "let us evaluate structures of such accretion flows with simple analytical discussions .",
    "the convective motion can prevent the advective energy transport when @xmath54 , which would be fulfilled when @xmath55 where @xmath56 should satisfy @xmath57 therefore , the equation of energy conservation should be modified by multiplying the factor @xmath58 to the left - hand side of eq .  ( [ energyeq ] ) to be @xmath59 other effects should be much milder than this suppression as will be discussed later .",
    "because of this suppression of the advective cooling , the significant amount of internal energy of the gas stay at the same radial position in the accretion disk . as a result",
    "the disk temperature would be much higher than in the case when the convection is neglected , and then the disk structure is expected to be significantly changed . in order to see this , we plot the sequence of the thermal equilibrium solutions for convective ndafs on the @xmath60 and @xmath61 plane for various values of @xmath13 , fixing the radial position @xmath62 .",
    "by finding the sets of physical parameters which satisfy the fundamental equations for the disk structure , ( [ massconv ] ) , ( [ angmom ] ) , ( [ hydrostat ] ) and ( [ energyeq ] ) , we can derive the sequence of the thermal equilibrium solutions . in fig .",
    "1 we show them on the @xmath60 plane for @xmath63 , varying the viscosity parameter @xmath10 . here",
    "the mass accretion rate is normalized by the critical mass accretion rate , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath66 with proton mass @xmath67 and the thomson cross section @xmath68 .",
    "we can see that for lower values of @xmath10 the thermal equilibrium curves have a part with negative gradient , i.e. @xmath69 which means that this accretion flow is dynamically unstable ( see , e.g. lightman & eardley 1974 ; kato et al .",
    "in such accretion disks , we can expect the sporadical mass accretion onto the central black hole , which may occur in dwarf novae and some microquasars with a radiation pressure - dominated accretion disk",
    ". this can be the source of violent time variability in the grb prompt emissions with the mass accretion rate of a few times @xmath70 , which corresponds to @xmath71 erg  s@xmath72 .",
    "plane at @xmath63 ( solid lines ) with @xmath73 ( _ green line _ ) , @xmath74 ( _ red line _ ) , @xmath75 ( _ cyan line _ ) and @xmath76 ( _ blue line _ ) , plotted from top to bottom .",
    "the central black hole mass is set to be @xmath77 .",
    "the thermal equilibrium curves without taking into account the convection are also shown ( dashed lines ) .",
    "right regions with respect to the bending part are dominated by degenerate - electron pressure in which we are not interested in the current study.,width=302 ]    we also show in fig .",
    "2 the thermal equilibrium curves on the @xmath61 plane with the same parameter sets as in fig . 1 . here",
    "we can see that in the whole parameter space the thermal stability criterion , @xmath78 is satisfied , and so this accretion flow is thermally stable",
    ".     plane at @xmath63 with the same parameter sets as in fig .",
    "1 . there is a notable difference between the current case and the convection - inefficient one where the @xmath79 relation did not depend on @xmath10 in the normal slim - disk or ndaf solutions ( see table 1 of km02).,width=302 ]",
    "here we discuss the physical origin of the dynamical instability of ndafs with vertical convective motions presented in the last section . to see this",
    "let us express the physical properties of the accretion disk in terms of ( @xmath13 , @xmath17 ) or ( @xmath13 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "as for the former set of variables , it is obvious from eq .",
    "( 6 ) that the viscous heating rate @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath17",
    ". we can also express @xmath26 with the latter set of variables as follows . in the accretion flows with a mass accretion rate much larger than @xmath81 ,",
    "the pressure and entropy are dominated by radiation , i.e. @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in this case , the scale height @xmath16 would be proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the viscous heating rate @xmath85 should be proportional to @xmath86 .    on the other hand , as for the neutrino cooling processes ,",
    "the emissivity by the electron / positron capture process in electron - nondegeneracy limit can be approximated as @xmath87 while the emissivity by the electron - positron annihilation is @xmath88 in the nondegeneracy limit . in the unstable branch found in fig . 1 ( and the corresponding part in fig .",
    "2 ) , we can see that the pair annihilation process dominates the electron / positron capture process .",
    "therefore @xmath89 is approximately proportional to @xmath90 .    by equating the viscous heating rate and the neutrino cooling rate , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we can easily see that the temperature @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath91 and does not depend on @xmath13 , which is also found in fig .",
    "2 , because both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are proportional to @xmath92 when described in terms of ( @xmath13 , @xmath80 ) . considering the same part of the thermal equilibrium curves on the ( @xmath13 , @xmath17 ) plane , as @xmath93 , we can see that @xmath94 , which is seen in fig . 1 as a negative gradient part in each thermal equilibrium curve .",
    "we can interpret the physical reason of the viscously unstable branch in the convective ndafs as follows ; due to the vertical convection in the accretion disk , the advective energy transport would be significantly suppressed , and thus the disk temperature would become higher than in the case without the convection .",
    "in such a hot disk , electrons would not be degenerate and hence the electron - positron annihilation process would become an efficient cooling process .",
    "it can dominate the emissivity due to the electron / positron capture by nucleons ( @xmath95 ) , which was the dominant neutrino emission process in the ndaf models without the convection ( e.g. see km02 ) .",
    "therefore the temperature - dependence of the cooling rate would be changed and make the unstable branch appear in the ( @xmath13 , @xmath17 ) plane .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "1 that with smaller viscous parameter @xmath10 the unstable branch appears with smaller mass accretion rate @xmath17 .",
    "this is because the advective energy transport is more inefficient with smaller @xmath10 , which makes the disk temperature high enough for the electron - positron annihilation process to become dominant even with smaller mass accretion rate .",
    "in particular , the typical timescale for this instability is the order of the viscous timescale , @xmath96 and therefore when @xmath97 , which is often realized in the innermost region of ndaf , this timescale is short enough to account for the time variability observed in the prompt emissions of grbs .",
    "in this study , we show that if the convective energy transfer along the vertical direction , which is naturally expected in the radiation - pressure dominated accretion disk , the thermal equilibrium solution for a hyperaccretion disk would have a viscously unstable branch .",
    "when this branch is realized , highly time - dependent mass accretion onto a black hole would occur .",
    "such instabilities have been studied in the contexts of dwarf novae ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; hoshi 1979 ; smak 1982 ) and microquasars which have radiation pressure - dominated accretion disks in themselves ( lightman & eardley 1974 ; shibazaki & hoshi 1975 ; pringle 1976 ; shakura & sunyaev 1976 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) , and the time variable features observed in those sources are theoretically interpreted with the model of those instabilities . in the context of grbs ,",
    "the process discussed in this study may lead to the intermittent energy release from a hyperaccretion disk , and then the highly inhomogeneous jet would be launched , which can be the origin of the short - term variability in the prompt emission of grbs . judging from isotropic luminosities of observed long grbs ( @xmath98 ) ,",
    "the accretion rate adopted here @xmath99 is relatively small .",
    "however , recent observations show that there is a population of low luminosity grbs ( @xmath100 ; e.g. galama et al .",
    "1998 ; campana et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the variabilities of their prompt emissions may be explained with our model .",
    "our model may be also appropriate to describing the late time activity of grbs such as x - ray flares in afterglows ( e.g. burrows et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we should note that the absorption optical depth for neutrinos is smaller than unity , according to eqs .",
    "( 55)-(57 ) in kohri et al .",
    "this means that we do not have to consider the neutrino trapping effect in the current situation ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) .",
    "we should mention the effect of magnetohydrodyanmic turbulence on the convection in our accretion disks .",
    "a hyperaccretion disk should have a turbulent structure due to the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , and it would help the mass accretion as the turbulent viscosity ( cf .",
    "balbus and hawley 1991 ) . here",
    ", using @xmath10 parameter , we can describe the turbulent viscosity @xmath103 as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath16 are the speed of sound and the scale height of an accretion flow , respectively . in our study",
    "@xmath10 parameter is assumed to be relatively small value , @xmath106 , which may be due to the suppression of mri in a hyperaccretion flow ( masada et al .",
    "in other words , the typical scale and the speed of mri turbulence in our accretion flows are much smaller than the scale height and the speed of sound , respectively .",
    "so , in our cases , we can say that the convective motion would not be disturbed by mri turbulence because the typical scale length and speed of convection are @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the convective energy transport along the vertical direction can also affect the structure of the slim disk , in which the optical depth for photon @xmath109 is so large that the photon trapping is efficient .",
    "if the timescale for the vertical convection is shorter than that of radiative diffusion , the photons generated in the equatorial plane can be convected upward to the disk surface and emitted out efficiently .",
    "this means that the effective optical depth would get much smaller than that in the case without convection .",
    "this modification should appear in the radiative cooling term of the energy conservation equation approximately by multiplying a factor of @xmath58 , to the optical depth , i.e. , like @xmath110 .",
    "this modification in @xmath109 makes the equilibrium curve for the standard disk shift to a larger @xmath13 and a higher @xmath80 regions such as @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "in addition to these effects in the multi - dimensional treatments , we should also consider a diffusion of photon along with the @xmath47-axis , which also affects the photon - trapping region ( kohri et al .",
    "therefore although the current ndaf region with @xmath113 and @xmath114 discussed in this letter should not be affected by these modifications , to know the whole structure of the disks , we would have to perform much more precise numerical simulations with reliable treatments of the convection , the diffusion and the neutrino transfer .",
