    "the investigation of quantum entanglement and quantum correlations in distinct physical systems is of great interest for both quantum information and many - body physics @xcite . while the evaluation of entanglement in systems with a high dimensional hilbert space is in general a difficult problem ,",
    "boson systems described by quadratic hamiltonians in the basic boson operators offer the invaluable advantage of admitting an exact evaluation of entanglement measures in both the ground and thermal state , through the gaussian state formalism @xcite .",
    "the latter allows to express the entanglement entropy @xcite and negativity @xcite of any bipartition of a gaussian state in terms of the symplectic eigenvalues of covariance matrices of the basic operators .",
    "moreover , the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) separability criterion @xcite is both necessary and sufficient for two - mode mixed gaussian states @xcite ( and also @xmath0 bipartitions of @xmath1 modes gaussian states @xcite ) , turning the negativity into a rigorous entanglement indicator for these systems .",
    "let us also remark that there is presently a great interest in continuous variable based quantum information @xcite , where gaussian states constitute the basic element .",
    "in addition , an approximate yet analytic evaluation of the _ quantum discord _ @xcite in two - mode gaussian states was recently achieved @xcite , by restricting the local measurement that determines this quantity to a gaussian measurement @xcite . quantum discord is a measure of quantum correlations which coincides with the entanglement entropy in pure states but differs essentially from entanglement in mixed states , where it can be non - zero even if the state is separable , i.e. , with no entanglement .",
    "the current interest in the quantum discord was triggered by its presence @xcite in certain mixed state based quantum computation schemes which provide exponential speedup over classical ones @xcite , yet exhibiting no entanglement @xcite .",
    "important properties of states with non - zero discord were recently unveiled @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to examine , using the gaussian state formalism , the entanglement and quantum correlations between two harmonic modes generated by an angular momentum coupling .",
    "such system arises , for instance , when considering a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field in an anisotropic quadratic potential , or also a particle in a rotating anisotropic harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the model has then been employed in several areas , including the description of deformed rotating nuclei @xcite , anisotropic quantum dots in a magnetic field @xcite , and fast rotating bose - einstein condensates @xcite in the lowest landau level approximation @xcite .",
    "containing just quadratic couplings in the associated boson operators , the different terms in the hamiltonian may in principle be also simulated by standard optical means @xcite .",
    "for a general quadratic potential , the model exhibits a complex dynamical phase diagram @xcite , presenting distinct types of stable and unstable domains and admitting the possibility of stabilizing an initially unstable system by increasing the field or frequency @xcite .",
    "the model provides then an interesting and physically relevant scenario for analyzing the behavior of mode entanglement in different regimes and near the onset of different types of instabilities , with the advantage of allowing an exact analytic evaluation of entanglement and quantum correlation measures at both zero and finite temperature .",
    "in addition , the present results indicate that mode entanglement can be easily controlled in this systems by modifying the field or frequency , suggesting a potential for quantum information applications .",
    "let us finally mention that the dynamics of entanglement in other two - mode systems were examined in @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we describe the model and derive the analytic expressions for the vacuum entanglement entropy and the thermal negativity .",
    "the basic features of the quantum discord are also discussed .",
    "the detailed behavior of entanglement with the relevant control parameters is then analyzed in sec.[iii ] , where we show that while vacuum entanglement diverges at the edges of stable sectors , being correlated with the angular momentum , at finite temperature entanglement is finite , and non - zero just within a finite field window and below a _",

    "[ f7 ] the thermal behavior of the negativity with that of the gaussian quantum discord @xmath395 ( eq .  ( [ dy ] ) ) and also @xmath248 . for reference",

    "hence , for high @xmath346 @xmath399 becomes independent of @xmath404 , with @xmath405 asymptotically if @xmath406 , as verified in fig .",
    "we also remark that the discord remains finite for @xmath183 in the whole sector @xmath179 .",
    "we have analyzed the entanglement induced by an angular momentum coupling on two harmonic modes .",
    "full analytic expressions for the vacuum entanglement entropy and the thermal negativity were derived .",
    "the model exhibits a rich phase structure and admits distinct physical realizations ( particle in a magnetic field in an anisotropic harmonic trap , or particle in a rotating harmonic trap ) , which lead to different entanglement behaviors with the relevant control parameter .",
    "for instance , in sector a ( stable vacuum ) , entanglement saturates for strong fields in the first case , but diverges at a finite frequency in the second case . vacuum entanglement diverges at the onset of instabilities , being correlated with the average angular momentum and reaching higher values in unstable domains dynamically stabilized by the field or rotation .",
    "in contrast , thermal entanglement is finite , and non - zero just below a _",
    "finite _ limit temperature within a reduced frequency window , diverging only for @xmath355 at the instability borders .",
