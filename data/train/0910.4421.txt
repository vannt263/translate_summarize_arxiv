    "the strangeness production in heavy ion collisions has been proposed to play important roles in many aspects  @xcite . for an in - depth study of the heavy ion collisions , we should , firstly , have the proper understanding of the basic ingredients , i.e. , @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the study of the meson production from @xmath0 collisions itself also plays important role for exploring the baryon spectroscopy  @xcite .    in the intermediate energy region , the one pion production dominates the @xmath0 inelastic scattering as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp1 ] ; while the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 reactions dominate the strangeness production as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2 ] , for total cross sections  @xcite .",
    "the experimental differential cross sections for these reactions are still scarce . even for the largest channel , @xmath9 , whether the @xmath10 plays important role or not is still not settled  @xcite .    ,",
    "@xmath7 , and @xmath11 reactions  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] -1 cm    , @xmath7 , and @xmath11 reactions  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] -1 cm    recently , the data for the strangeness production in @xmath0 collisions at near - threshold energies have been appearing  @xcite and revealing large discrepancy with previous theoretical predictions .",
    "hence these reactions have been restudied theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 reaction , which has a special advantage for absence of complication caused by @xmath12 contribution because of the isospin and charge conversation , is a possible new excellent source for studying @xmath13 resonances .",
    "the previously theoretical works  @xcite on this reaction only reproduce the old data at higher beam energies well , but fail by order of magnitude compared with very recent cosy-11 data at energies close to threshold  @xcite .",
    "recently this reaction was restudied  @xcite . besides the ingredients considered in previous calculations",
    ", the sub-@xmath14-threshold @xmath15 resonance is added by taking into account both @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons exchange .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaktcs ] together with the data  @xcite for comparison . the contributions from @xmath18 exchange ) , @xmath19 exchange ) and @xmath20 exchange ) are shown separately by dot - dashed , dashed and dotted curves , respectively . the contribution from the @xmath1 production by the @xmath17 exchange",
    "is found to be very important for the whole energy range , in particular , for the two lowest data points close to the threshold .",
    "this gives a natural source for the serious underestimation of the near - threshold cross sections by previous calculations @xcite , which have neglected either @xmath1 resonance contribution  @xcite or @xmath17 exchange contribution @xcite .",
    "the solid curve in the figure is the simple sum of the three contributions and reproduces the cosy-11 data quite well .",
    "however , a more recent measurement of the reaction near its threshold by anke collaboration  @xcite gives a much smaller cross section than those by cosy-11",
    "since both detectors are not @xmath21 solid angle detectors , there is model dependence to deduce the total cross section from a fraction of @xmath21 solid angle measurement .",
    "a good dalitz plot measurement with a good @xmath21 solid angle detector would be very helpful to settle down the contradiction .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath2 resonances couples strongly to the @xmath22 channel  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was also found  @xcite to have strong coupling to @xmath23 based on bes data on @xmath24 and @xmath25 reactions  @xcite . with the large @xmath26 coupling constant , the contribution from @xmath2 to @xmath6",
    "is checked  @xcite in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the calculated results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lktcs ] .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves represent the contribution from @xmath2 and other @xmath12 resonances  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the solid line is the sum .    .,title=\"fig:\"]-1",
    "cm    .,title=\"fig:\"]-1 cm    since the @xmath2 has strong couplings to @xmath27 , @xmath23 and maybe also @xmath28  @xcite , there may be a significant @xmath29 components in it .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath2 may also have a significant coupling to the @xmath30 channel . assuming that the production of the @xmath31 meson in @xmath0 and @xmath32 collisions is predominantly through the excitation and decay of the sub-@xmath30-threshold @xmath2 resonance , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 reactions were calculated  @xcite .",
    "the results compared with the experimental data were shown by solid curve in figs .",
    "[ fig : piptcs ] &  [ fig : pphitcs ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pphitcs ] , the double dotted - dashed , dotted , dashed - dotted and dashed curves stand for contributions from @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37-meson exchanges and their simple sum , respectively .",
    "the solid line includes the @xmath38 @xmath0 fsi .",
    "reaction.,title=\"fig:\"]-1 cm     reaction.,title=\"fig:\"]-1 cm",
    "in summary , the largest strangeness production channels from @xmath0 collisions , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath39 reactions , have been restudied theoretically by including contributions from previously ignored @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances  @xcite .",
    "these sub - threshold resonances have been found to play dominant roles for the strangeness productions in @xmath0 collisions and should be included for further studies on the strangeness production from both @xmath0 collisions and heavy ion collisions .",
