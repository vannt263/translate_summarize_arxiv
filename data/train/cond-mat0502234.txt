    "optimization problems with large numbers of local minima occur in many fields of physics , engineering , and economics .",
    "they are closely related to statistical physics , see e.g.   ref .",
    "[ 1 ] . in the case of discrete variables ,",
    "such problems often arise from combinatorial optimization tasks .",
    "many of them are difficult to solve since they are np - hard , i.e. , there is no algorithm known which finds the exact solution with an effort proportional to any power of the problem size .",
    "one of the most popular such tasks is the traveling salesman problem : how to find the shortest roundtrip through a given set of cities @xcite .",
    "many combinatorial optimization problems are of considerable practical importance .",
    "thus , algorithms are needed which yield good approximations of the exact solution within a reasonable computing time , and which require only a modest effort in programming .",
    "various deterministic and probabilistic approaches , so - called search heuristics , have been proposed to construct such approximation algorithms .",
    "a considerable part of them borrows ideas from physics and biology .",
    "thus simulated annealing @xcite and relatives such as threshold accepting as well as various genetic algorithms @xcite have successfully been applied to many problems . particularly effective",
    "seem to be genetic algorithms in which the individuals are local minima @xcite . for recent physically motivated heuristic approaches",
    "we refer to thermal cycling @xcite , optimization by renormalization @xcite , and extremal optimization @xcite . for problems with continuous variables , approaches which combine monte - carlo procedures for global search with deterministic local search by standard numerical methods , for example the basin - hopping algorithm ,",
    "have proved to be particularly efficient @xcite .",
    "they can be considered as relatives of the genetic local search approaches for the case of discrete variables . here",
    "we focus on the thermal cycling algorithm and illuminate the reasons for its efficiency .",
    "simulated annealing @xcite can be understood as a random journey of the sample ( i.e.  the approximate solution ) through a hilly landscape formed by the states of its configuration space .",
    "the altitude , in the sense of a potential energy , corresponds to the quantity to be optimized .",
    "in the course of the journey , the altitude region accessible with a certain probability within a given number of steps shrinks gradually due to the decrease of the temperature in the metropolis simulation involved .",
    "the accessible area , i.e. , the corresponding configuration space volume , thus shrinks until the sample gets trapped in one of the local minima .",
    "deep valleys attract the sample mainly by their area .",
    "however , it is tempting to make use of their depth .",
    "for that , we substitute the slow cooling down by a cyclic process : first , starting from the lowest state obtained so far , we randomly deposit energy into the sample by means of a metropolis process with a certain temperature @xmath0 , which is terminated , however , after a small number of steps .",
    "this part is referred to as heating .",
    "then we quench the sample by means of a local search algorithm .",
    "heating and quenching are cyclically repeated where the amount of energy deposited in a cycle decreases gradually , see fig .  1 .",
    "this process continues until , within a ` reasonable ' cpu time , no further improvement can be found .",
    "it is an essential feature of the thermal cycling algorithm that two contradicting demands are met in heating : the gains of the previous cycles have to be retained , but the modifications must be sufficiently large , so that another valley can be reached .",
    "thus the heating process has to be terminated in an early stage of the equilibration .",
    "an effective method is to stop it after a fixed number of successful metropolis steps .",
    "the efficiency of the proposed algorithm depends to a large extent on the move class considered in the local search procedure . for discrete optimization problems ,",
    "it is a great advantage of our approach that far more complex moves can be taken into account than in simulated annealing so that the number of local minima is considerably reduced .",
    "the local search concerning complex moves can be enormously sped up by use of branch - and - bound type algorithms .",
    "their basic idea is to construct new trial states following a decision tree : at each branching point , a lower bound of the energy of the trial state is calculated .",
    "the search within the current branch is terminated as soon as this bound exceeds the energy of the initial state .",
    "the basic thermal cycling procedure can be easily accelerated in three ways : ( i ) partition of the computational effort into several search processes in order to minimize the failure risk @xcite , ( ii ) restricting the moves in heating to the ` sensible sample regions ' by analyzing previous cycles , or by comparing with samples considered in parallel , and ( iii ) combining parts of different states @xcite .",
    "the thermal cycling algorithm was first tested on the traveling salesman problem @xcite .",
    "for that , we considered problems of various size from the tsplib95 @xcite for which the exact solutions , or at least related bounds , are known .",
    "2 gives a comparison of thermal cycling data with results from simulated annealing and from repeated local searches starting from random states . for a meaningful characterization of the algorithms",
    ", it relates mean deviations from the optimum tour length to the cpu - time effort for various parameter values .",
    "the diagram includes data for two move classes : ( a ) cutting a roundtrip twice , reversing the direction of one of its parts , and connecting the parts then again , or shifting a city from one to another position in the roundtrip ; ( b ) same as ( a ) and additionally rearrangements by up to four simultaneous cuts as well as lin - kernighan realignments @xcite .",
    "2 shows that , for the traveling salesman problem , thermal cycling is clearly superior to simulated annealing , already if the same move class is considered in both procedures  the simulated annealing code had been carefully tuned too .",
    "however , when taking advantage of the possibility to incorporate more complex moves , thermal cycling beats simulated annealing by orders of magnitude in cpu time",
    ". applied to an archive of samples instead of to a single one , it can compete with leading genetic local search algorithms @xcite .    for several years",
    ", we have used thermal cycling as standard approach in numerical investigations of the coulomb glass , which is basically an ising model with long - range interactions . also in this case , thermal cycling proved to be a very efficient tool .",
    "3 presents data from an investigation comparing several algorithms @xcite . in simulated annealing",
    ", we could efficiently treat only particle exchange with a reservoir and one - particle hops inside the sample , that is occupation changes of one or two sites .",
    "however , in the deterministic local search , the simultaneous occupation modification of up to four sites could be considered by means of branch - and - bound approaches .",
    "therefore , the corresponding multistart local search yields significantly better results than simulated annealing .",
    "thermal cycling of the low - energy states proves to be still far more efficient than the local search repeatedly starting from random states .",
    "it is tempting to apply the thermal cycling approach also to problems with continuous variables .",
    "thus we have considered lennard - jones cluster of various size because the energy landscapes of this system are known to have large numbers of local minima .",
    "the heating consisted of simulateneously shifting all atoms by small distances a few times according to a thermal rejection rule , and the quench combined the powell algorithm with a systematic consideration of symmetry positions .",
    "the ground states of several clusters of up to 150 atoms could be reproduced within ` reasonable ' cpu times .",
    "further related investigations should be promising .",
