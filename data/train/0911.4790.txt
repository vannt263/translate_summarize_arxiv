    "em cyg is an eclipsing dwarf nova which has relatively long orbital period ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "dwarf novae are evolved binary stars , where the roche lobe - filling red dwarf component accretes matter onto the white dwarf component .",
    "loosing angular momentum , matter forms an accretion disc .",
    "such systems produce outbursts , caused by instabilities in the disc .",
    "em cyg was discovered by hoffmeister in 1928 .",
    "@xcite investigated instabilities on the eclipse light curves and noted , that they reflect instabilities in accretion disc .",
    "@xcite detected rapid oscillations on light curves with typical time scale of 14.6 and 16.5 seconds .",
    "@xcite , using long - term photographic observations found outburst cycle to be 24 - 25 days and noted the seasonal changes of the light curve and the outburst cycle .    because em cyg shows standstills @xcite , it is classified as z cam type star .",
    "so em cyg is the only eclipsing dwarf nova among z cam type stars .    using radial velocities ,",
    "@xcite estimated masses to be 0.7 @xmath1 and 0.9 @xmath1 for the white dwarf and the red dwarf respectively .",
    "these parameters corresponded to the thermal - timescale mass transfer in the system , and were doubtful .",
    "@xcite found that the orbital inclination of the system is about @xmath2 and the mass relation close to results obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the spectrum of em cyg in the range 6230 - 6650 @xmath3 is contaminated by light from a k2 - 5v star ( in addition to the k - type mass donor star ) .",
    "the k2 - 5v star contributes approximately 16 % of the light from the system in that band and , if not taken into account , has a considerable effect upon radial velocity measurements of the mass donor star .",
    "the revised value of the mass ratio , combined with the orbital inclination @xmath4 , leads to the masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the mass donor and white dwarf respectively .",
    "recent more precise measurements of the third star light by welsh et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that masses to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "there are several too different estimates of the distance to em cyg . from ellipsoidal variations in the infrared band",
    ", @xcite found secondary spectral type to be k2v and the distance to the system to be 320 pc .",
    "@xcite using k magnitudes of @xcite determined the possible distance to be in the range 285 - 429 pc with most probable value of about 352 pc . but",
    "@xcite , using private communication of stover suggests 400 pc in his calculations .",
    "taking into account the light of the third star , @xcite supposed the distance to be 450 - 500 pc .",
    "winter and sion ( 2003 ) found 411 parsecs using the @xmath9 versus @xmath10 relation @xcite , but they determined only 210 parsecs when they fitted the iue spectra .",
    "latest paper of @xcite give the distances ranged from 200 to 380 pc for different wd+disc models of uv spectra .",
    "model fits for ultraviolet data @xcite give mass accretion rate estimates to be about @xmath11 .",
    "this value lies below the upper limit ( @xmath12 ) , determined by @xcite from the o - c diagram analysis .    according to @xcite",
    ", there are no circular polarization above about 0.3% in em cyg .    despite low galactic latitude ( + 4.28@xmath13 ) ,",
    "the reddening estimate @xmath14 towards em cyg is only 0.03@xmath150.05 @xcite .",
    "our photometric observations of em cyg were obtained during september , 2006 using the azt-11 telescope ( d=1.25 m , cassegrain system ) of the crimean astrophysical observatory ( ukraine ) with the fli ccd camera in r band with 15 sec exposure and using the pupava telescope ( d=280 mm , newton system ) with the meade dsi pro ccd camera in r band with 30 sec exposure in vyhorlat observatory ( slovak republic ) during may - november , 2007 ( fig.1 , see online database http://var.kozmos.sk ) .",
    "the quantity of observational runs are 8 for crimean data and 61 for slovakian data .",
    "ccd images were processed with c - munipack package @xcite , including flatfielding and debiasing .",
    "the procedure of the \" artificial  mean weighted star @xcite was used to calculate of the instrumental magnitudes of em cyg . using a secondary photometric standard from @xcite , we calculated transformation coefficients for converting the magnitudes from the instrumental system of pupava telescope :    @xmath16    moments of minima we determined using the method of `` asymptotic parabola '' @xcite ( table 1 ) .",
    "to achieve a higher accuracy with period determination , we used 30 moments of minima obtained by the previous investigators too @xcite .",
    "the improved elements are @xmath17    .28 heliocentric moments of minima of em cyg ( hjd-240000 ) .",
    "( 1 ) - crimean data , ( 2 ) : slovakian data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     taking into account of interstellar extinction , we calculated the brightness distribution in the eclipsing part of accretion disc for the distances of 200 , 300 , 400 and 500 parsecs .",
    "using the brightness distribution in accretion disc and the blackbody approximation , we calculated the brightness temperature distributions and compare it with predictions of the stationary accretion disc models . in fig .",
    "3 the radial brightness temperature plots for different distances are shown .",
    "the dashed lines are the temperature distribution predicted for the steady state solutions for different accretion rates .",
    "the thick solid line represents the critical temperature above which gas is ionized and supports the steady accretion regime @xcite .",
    "when we use the distance to the system to be 200 pc , the temperature distribution fit is close to the steady state model distribution with @xmath18 for the quiescent state and the outburst state both . at the same time , the critical temperature curve lies above the outburst temperature distribution curve .    in the case",
    "when the distance to be 500 pc the temperature distributions in the outburst and the quiescent states both are even steeper than the steady state models what is uncommon .",
    "from the temperature distribution curve in quiescent state we can find the size of accretion disc to be about @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the binary separation .",
    "this value slightly larger than that determined by @xcite @xmath21 from uv data .    comparing the temperature distribution with the steady state models , we estimated the mass accretion rate for different distances to the system in the quiescent and in the outburst states both ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate estimates were calculated by minimizing of the mean square deviation of observed temperature values from the steady state temperature distribution for different accretion rates .",
    "our mass accretion rate estimates are close to values , determined by the previous investigators , if we choose the distance to be about 200 pc . at the same time , the disc becomes ionized according to @xcite critical temperature curve during outburst for the models with distance larger than 300 pc .",
    "distances about 500 pc demand ionized gas state in the disc even for quiescent states , what is improbable .",
    "so , using ionization criteria during outburst state , we must accept the distances , ranged between 300 and 400 pc .",
    "another estimate of the distance we can make using ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve in the quiescent state , where such effect is mostly pronounced .",
    "using mean flux of the secondary from our model , we find that it has @xmath22 .",
    "if the secondary star having mass to be @xmath23 is a normal main sequence star , the spectral class must be k0v . in that case",
    "@xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite and the distance must be about 459 pc . at the same time for the system parameters we used , to fill its roche lobe , the secondary must be slightly evolved .",
    "if we use the spectral class value k2v , determined by @xcite the distance estimate will be 400 pc .",
    "this value is the same as determined by @xcite using the @xmath9 versus @xmath10 relation .",
    "the distance of 400 pc in our models corresponds to relatively high accretion rate .",
    "taking into account that the outburst state and the quiescent state have practically equal durations we estimate of the mass transfer rate to be about @xmath26 .",
    "this value about an order higher than determined by @xcite upper limit @xmath27 for conservative mass transfer .",
    "to explain of observed stability of the orbital period in the case of high mass transfer rate we can take into account of magnetic braking effect . using relations from @xcite",
    "we find that in the case of system parameters from table 2 , the mass transfer rate which can be neutralized by magnetic braking is about @xmath28 .",
    "so , magnetic braking of em cyg system can explain of the mass transfer rate wich we have found for the case of 400 pc distance .",
    "our present result supports the suggestion of @xcite that these two effects neutralize each other and that is why we do not see any observable period variation .",
    "in this paper , using large volume of minima timings we specified the orbital period of the system .",
    "our r band light curves in the quiescent state show significant ellipsoidality effect .",
    "firstly for this star we used the eclipse mapping technique of the outer parts of accretion disc .",
    "we estimated the mass accretion rate for different distances and showed , that the distance must be in the range between 300 and 400 pc . using ellipsoidal variability of the secondary star we estimated the distance to be about 400 pc .",
    "also we showed , that the magnetic braking effect can explain of @xmath26 mass transfer rate , which has been found for 400 pc distance .",
