    "in this paper , we consider a class of stochastic processes referred to as stochastic hybrid systems ( shss ) , and present results about their behavior in or near equilibrium .",
    "one motivation for considering shss is if we want to model a system represented by a state that continuously evolves in time ( e.g. according to an ode or an sde ) , with the additional complication that the variable , or even the state space itself , can undergo rapid changes . to consider one specific example , consider an engineered system where the state of the system is given by a vector @xmath0 when the system is in `` normal '' operation , but when the system is in an `` impaired '' state , only the first @xmath1 variables of the state are able to evolve , and the remainder stay fixed .",
    "moreover , assume that the switching between normal and impaired operation happens randomly , but in a manner that depends on the state @xmath2 .",
    "the study of shss has a long history , going back at least to  @xcite ; the main theoretical foundations of the field were laid out in the book  @xcite .",
    "there is a large literature devoted to the understanding the stability analysis of such systems  @xcite ( this stability is typically understood in a moment or almost - sure sense ) and more recent work aimed at developing methods to explicitly compute or estimate observables of such systems  @xcite .",
    "additionally , metastability and large deviations in shss were studied in  @xcite using path - integral methods .",
    "shss represent a powerful formalism that has been applied to many fields , including : networked control systems  @xcite , power systems  @xcite , system reliability theory  @xcite , and chemical reaction dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a recent review of the state of the art of such systems , that also contains an extensive history , bibliography , and list of applications of shss , is the comprehensive review  @xcite .",
    "the state space of an shs is comprised of a _ discrete state _ and a _ continuous state _ ; the pair formed by these is what we refer to as the _ combined state _ of the shs .",
    "one can think of a shs as a family of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) for the continuous state that are indexed by the discrete state .",
    "the discrete state changes stochastically , and we think of this as switching between sdes . additionally , each discrete - state transition is associated with a reset map that defines how the pre - transition discrete and continuous states map into the post - transition discrete and continuous states , so that the continuous variable can be `` reset '' when the discrete state changes .",
    "we denote the discrete state space by @xmath3 , and assume that the continuous state space is @xmath4 .",
    "then choose @xmath5 different sdes , indexed by @xmath6 , so that when the discrete state is @xmath7 , @xmath8 evolves according to @xmath9 then , we assume that there are a family of rate functions @xmath10 and reset functions @xmath11 such that if the discrete state is @xmath7 , the probability of a jump to state @xmath12 in the next @xmath13 is @xmath14 , and , if such a jump occurs , the map @xmath15 is applied to the continuous state at the time of jump .",
    "[ this process can be described more precisely in a `` non - asymptotic '' formalism , and we do this in section  [ sec : definition ] . ] from this , it follows that there is a continuous - time process , @xmath16 , that evolves according to some law , and the full system we are studying is @xmath17 it is not hard to show that the process defined in this way is strong markov  @xcite . to fully characterize the shs , we need to compute the expectation of some large class of functions evaluated on its state space . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we want to understand the process in equilibrium , or on the way to equilibrium , i.e. , the statistics of the process after it has evolved for a long time .",
    "the existence  @xcite and smoothness  @xcite of the invariant measure of these processes has been established , and in one sense , the goal of this paper is to explicitly compute as much about this measure as we can , and we approach this by studying the moments of the process , i.e. the expectation of polynomial functions of the process in equilibrium .    using the infinitesimal generator of the process , following  @xcite ,",
    "we can write down a set of differential equations for the moments of this process  we refer to this set of equations as the _ moment flow equations_. these equations are _ a priori _ infinite - dimensional , and as we show below , in a wide variety of circumstances they are `` inherently infinite - dimensional",
    ", '' by which we mean that : ( i ) there is no projection of the dynamics onto a finite - dimensional subspace , and ( ii ) any approximate projection into a finite - dimensional subspace behaves poorly in a sense to be made precise below .",
    "this inherent infinite - dimensionality is typically called a _",
    "moment closure problem _ in a variety of physical and mathematical contexts , in the sense that one can not `` close '' the moment flow equations in a finite way .",
    "examples of moment closure problems and various approaches to handle them span a wide range , including applications in : chemical kinetics  @xcite , dynamic graphs  @xcite , physics  @xcite , population dynamics / epidemiology  @xcite , and nonlinear pde  @xcite .",
    "our approach is related to and inspired by the lyapunov moment stability theory that has been well - developed for diffusions , especially those with small noise , over the past few decades  @xcite .",
    "we mention that a moment closure problem for shss was solved nicely in  @xcite and related works , but in contrast the problem there was to find a moment closure approximation that was valid for a finite time interval .",
    "since we are interested in equilibrium or near - equilibrium statistics of the problem , we want to study the problem on the infinite time interval .      in this paper , we assume that the dynamics on the continuous state are deterministic , i.e. , all of the sdes are assumed to be odes , but there is still randomness in how the discrete states switch amongst each other .",
    "[ these types of systems are also called `` randomly switched systems '' in the literature  @xcite , but are a subclass of the shs formalism so it makes sense to have a unifying name .",
    "] the fact that the continuous evolution does not have a diffusion term makes the analysis both easier and harder _ a priori _ in the sense that the determinism allows for some simplification in certain recurrence relations , but without diffusions , the generator is only hypoelliptic , and thus the existence of , and convergence to , invariant measures for the process is more difficult to establish .",
    "we discuss all of these issues below .    in this work ,",
    "we want to understand the scenario where the two parts of the system ( the ode and the reset ) have competing effects .",
    "for example , if the ode and the reset both send all orbits to zero , then their mixture does as well , and , conversely , if they send all orbits to infinity , then the mixture does as well .",
    "what is more interesting is the case in which the ode and the resets have opposite effects , and we consider one such case here : the ode sends orbits to infinity , but the resets send orbits toward zero .",
    "we give a few prototypical examples of such systems , and discuss the results of this paper that apply to each . in each of these cases , we present a model the continuous variable of which is defined on the positive real line ; this can be thought of as the fundamental model of interest , or the radial component of a system in higher dimension ( see section  [ sec : radial ] for a discussion about dynamics of higher - dimensional systems ) .",
    "* example 1 .",
    "* let @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] and define the ode , jump rate , and reset as @xmath20 the theory presented in section  [ sec : mc1 ] implies that the shs in   converges to an invariant distribution with all finite moments of all orders , and this fact is independent of the values of @xmath21 ( although of course the moments themselves depend on these parameters ) .",
    "* example 2 .",
    "* next , consider the system @xmath22 the theory of section  [ sec : blowup ] tells us that , depending on the value of @xmath23 , this process can have multiple behaviors : if @xmath24 , then all solutions of   blow up in finite time , if @xmath25 , then solutions go to zero with high probability , but enough of them escape to infinite fast enough that the moments of the solution blow up in finite time , but if @xmath26 , then the solution converges to zero in every sense .",
    "( see theorem  [ thm : type1 ] for the specific statements . )",
    "* example 3 . * finally , consider the system @xmath27 theorem  [ thm : type2 ] tells us that all solutions of this system blowup with probability one , and this fact is independent of the parameters @xmath21 .    the theory in sections  [ sec : mc1 ] and  [ sec : blowup ] generalizes the statements in examples  1  3 to arbitrary polynomials .",
    "the critical difference between the three cases are the relative degrees , and in some cases the leading - order coefficients , of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , although the two latter cases both exhibit finite - time blowup , they are of a much different character . in the quadratic case ,",
    "the system blows up in finite time even though there are infinitely many jumps , and as such , exhibit a quality very much like that of an explosive markov chain . in the cubic case ,",
    "the blowup is more like that seen in nonlinear odes : the system goes off to infinity in finite time and there are only a finite number of jumps .    in examples  1    3",
    ", there was a single discrete state and all jumps mapped the state back to itself .",
    "we also analyze the moments of the shs with multiple discrete states in section  [ sec : mc2 ] .",
    "we show that the behavior can be characterized similarly to that of one state in many situations , but we also exhibit new types of behavior here .",
    "for example , we show that in many cases , the system can exhibit _ marginal moment stability _ , by which we mean that in equilibrium , the system can have some moments finite , and others that are infinite ; thus the equilibrium distribution has fat tails . in this case , we show numerically that the equilibrium distributions have power law behavior .",
    "we also show that the moment flow equations have a very strange property .",
    "these equations are an infinite - dimensional linear system that supports a fixed point that corresponds to the moments of the invariant measure .",
    "we show that any finite - dimensional truncation of this system has only unstable fixed points , and , moreover , as the size of truncation grows , the system has larger positive eigenvalues .",
    "this motivates the result that the infinite - dimensional system is ill - posed in `` the pde sense '' in a manner analogous to a time - reversed heat equation .",
    "however , we then show that the minimal amount of convexity given by jensen s inequality is enough to make this system well - posed and well - behaved , and in particular it then becomes faithful to the stochastic process .",
    "this seems to be a strange example of a system that is ill - behaved on a linear space becoming well - behaved when restricted to a nonlinear submanifold of that same space .",
    "the main results and structure of this paper are as follows . in section  [ sec : problem ] , we give a formal definition of the shs that we study , and define the moment flow .",
    "next , we identify a broad class of assumptions for shss under which the moment equations are well - defined and accurate on the infinite - time interval , but we also show that there is a surprising subtlety that arises in the consideration of same ; these results are contained in sections  [ sec : mc1 ] and  [ sec : mc2 ] .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : blowup ] , we study the shs where moment closure fails , and in fact the shs undergoes finite - time blowups , i.e. , the process becomes infinite in expectation , or almost surely , at a finite time .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : exact ] , we write down a few exact recurrence relations for shss and show that we can use these , at least in some cases , to compute arbitrarily good approximations .",
    "in this section , we provide the formal definition of the shs , and define its generator .",
    "then , we use the generator together with dynkin s formula to develop a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of the moments of the shs .",
    "finally , we provide a description of the shs using radial components , which allows us to introduce a simplified model of the shs ; analyzing this model is essentially the focus of the remainder of the paper .",
    "consider a countable set @xmath3 of discrete states and a family of phase spaces @xmath30 , one for each discrete state .",
    "we assume that we have defined a family of ( random ) dynamical systems @xmath31 , with @xmath32 defined on phase space @xmath30 .",
    "the main notion driving shs is that we want to consider a stochastic process that : ( i ) in each small timestep @xmath33 , the system can jump from state @xmath7 to state @xmath12 with probability @xmath34 ; and ( ii ) if it does not jump , it stays in state @xmath7 and evolves under the dynamics given by @xmath32 .",
    "as such , we are combining the standard models of a dynamical system on a state space with the notion of a discrete - state markov process ; the system jumps amongst a countable family of states as it would be a markov chain , and whenever it is in a particular state , it evolves according to the dynamics attached to that state space . solving the model is complicated by the fact that we allow the jump rates to depend on the state , so that we can not ( for example ) determine the jump times and then solve for the continuous flows ; they are intimately connected .    for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we will assume that the dynamical systems on each phase space are ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , but there is no significant obstruction to generalizing the individual flows to sdes or even general random dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "we now give the precise definition of a shs .",

    "this definition is complicated and we want to connect the formal definition of the process to an intuitive notion of what it should do .",
    "first , note that it is clear from   that between jumps , the continuous state evolves according to the appropriate ode , and the discrete state remains unchanged .",
    "moreover , from   we see that if the system jumps , and it jumps from state @xmath7 to state @xmath12 , then @xmath93 is updated to the value @xmath12 , and the continuous state is updated by applying the map @xmath94 .    it is also clear from the definition that the process is cadlag ( i.e. , is right - continuous and has left - limits at every jump , and continuous otherwise ) .",
    "moreover , the process is stationary , since the odes and the rate functions do not depend explicitly on time .",
    "finally , we intuitively want that , given the current state @xmath95 , the probability of a jump occurring in @xmath96 should be the sum of all of the current jump rates , i.e. , @xmath97 , and the probability of jumping to state @xmath12 is equal to the relative proportion of @xmath98 to this total rate(qv .",
    "proposition  [ prop : intuition ] below ) .    before we state and",
    "prove proposition  [ prop : intuition ] , let us first consider the special case that many readers will be familiar with , namely , the case where @xmath41 does not depend on @xmath2 at all and can be written @xmath99",
    ". then the jumps are given by a continuous - time markov chain ( ctmc ) , and the @xmath100 numbers @xmath99 are then the transition rates @xmath101 .",

    "* theorem  2.3.3 ) ) . finally , @xmath108 , and this is independent of @xmath63 . in words ,",
    "the rate of jumping to state @xmath7 is the constant rate @xmath104 , the total rate of any jump occurring is the sum of the individual rates of each jump occurring , and the probability of any given jump occurring is equal to its proportion to the sum of all the rates .    the only way in which the current framework is more complicated than a standard ctmc is that the transition rates change in time , and they change in such a way as to make them a function of the continuous state .    [",
    "prop : intuition ] we consider the shs in definition  [ shs_def ] start the shs in state @xmath71 , and define @xmath63 as the time of the first jump .",
    "then for @xmath109 , the discrete state @xmath110 does not change , and @xmath8 evolves according to the ode , so @xmath111 . then @xmath112    first note that @xmath113 iff @xmath114 for all @xmath7 , and @xmath115 iff @xmath116 for some @xmath7 .",
    "next , we see that @xmath117 and so @xmath118 by the memorylessness property of exponential random variables . but note that for @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121    in short , the probability that a jump to @xmath7 occurs in the next @xmath13 is @xmath122 when @xmath13 is sufficiently small , so the probability that some jump occurs is clearly the sum of these ( up to @xmath123 ) , and the relative probability of it being @xmath124 is the relative proportion of the @xmath7th rate with respect to the others .",
    "although the definition is given recursively for simplicity , it is not hard to see that we can choose all of the randomness of this process `` up front '' ,",
    "i.e. , we can choose streams of iid exponentials @xmath125 for @xmath126 at the beginning , then use these streams to determine the @xmath127th jump time @xmath75 ( note that we are discarding all of the @xmath128 that are not used in this step ) .",
    "this allows us to define a map from any probability space @xmath129 rich enough to contain the streams @xmath128 to @xmath130 , the set of cadlag paths defined on @xmath131 .",
    "this induces a measure on the set of all paths , and , in particular , allows us to measure the probability of any event that can be determined by observing the paths .",
    "when we talk about probabilities of events below , we are implicitly assuming that this correspondence has been made .",
    "moreover , this will even allow us to compare paths of two ( or more ) different shs that are generated by different functions ; as long as we have a correspondence from @xmath132 to the exponential streams @xmath133 , the paths are completely determined by  .",
    "we will use this formalism throughout the remainder of the paper without further comment , and in general drop the dependence on @xmath134 .",
    "we follow the standard definition of the infinitesimal generator and derive the generator of the process here .",
    "let @xmath135 be bounded and differentiable , and define the following linear operator @xmath136 : @xmath137 - h(q , x)}{{\\epsilon}}.\\ ] ] from this , we can directly obtain _ dynkin s formula _ : @xmath138 = { \\mathbb{e}}[{\\mathcal{{l}}}h(q_t , x_t)],\\ ] ] or , said another way , the operator @xmath139 is a martingale .",
    "this allows us to extend the definition of the domain of @xmath136 through the martingale equation , and it is not hard to show that under weak assumptions on @xmath38 , @xmath44 , and @xmath28 , the domain of @xmath136 contains all polynomials  @xcite . in particular , we can compute directly that @xmath140 to give a formal derivation of  , we compute @xmath141\\\\    & \\quad= { \\mathbb{e}}[h(q_{t+\\epsilon},x_{t+\\epsilon } ) - h(q_t , x_t)|q_t = q , x_t = x,\\mbox { no jump}]{\\mathbb{p}}(\\mbox{no jump } ) \\\\&\\quad\\quad+ \\sum_{q'\\in{\\mathcal{{q}}}}{\\mathbb{e}}[h(q_{t+\\epsilon},x_{t+\\epsilon } ) - h(q_t , x_t)|q_t = q , x_t = x,\\mbox { jump to $ q'$}]{\\mathbb{p}}(\\mbox { jump to $ q'$})\\\\    & = ( h(q , x+{\\epsilon}f(q , x ) ) - h(q , x))\\left(1-o(\\epsilon)\\right)+ \\sum_{q'\\in{\\mathcal{{q } } } } ( h(q',\\psi_{q'}(q , x))-h(q , x))(\\epsilon \\lambda_{q'}(q , x ) ) + o(\\epsilon^2)\\\\    & = \\epsilon ( f(q , x)\\cdot \\nabla_xh(q , x ) + \\sum_{q'\\in{\\mathcal{{q } } } } \\lambda_{q'}(q , x)\\left(h(q',\\psi_{q'}(q , x ) ) - h(q , x)\\right ) ) + o(\\epsilon^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and from this and the definition of @xmath136 we have established   formally .",
    "we have not been careful to specify the domain of @xmath136 , but it is clear from this argument that this derivation is valid for all @xmath142 . as is shown in  @xcite , we can then extend the domain of the generator using   to encompass all polynomials and indicator functions . strictly speaking ,",
    "this means that the new generator is an extension of the previous one , and we will use this without further comment in the sequel .",
    "a quick perusal of   makes it clear that if we assume that @xmath51 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 are polynomials in @xmath2 , then the right - hand side sends polynomials to polynomials .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath145 is any function that is polynomial in @xmath2 , then @xmath146 is also polynomial in @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", we denote @xmath147 , and we see that @xmath148 is a polynomial in @xmath2 , so that dynkin s formula becomes an ( infinite - dimensional ) linear ode on the set @xmath149 . however , the first challenge that we obtain is clear : if the degree of any @xmath51 is greater than one , or the degree of any of the @xmath143 or @xmath144 are positive , then we see that the degrees of the terms on the right - hand side of the equation are higher than those on the left , and we are thus led to the problem of _ moment closure_. on the other hand , we still have a linear system , even if it is infinite - dimensional .",
    "thus , we might hope to make sense of this flow by writing down a semigroup on a reasonable function space .",
    "in fact , we show in section  [ sec : paradox ] that this is in general not possible .",
    "consider the case where @xmath150 for all @xmath7 , and we can abuse notation slightly and identify @xmath4 as the continuous state space .",
    "consider the ode @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "write @xmath153 , for @xmath154 and @xmath155 . since @xmath156",
    ", we see that @xmath157 or @xmath158 in general , this depends on both @xmath159 and @xmath160 through @xmath8 , and we can not project the dynamics onto @xmath159 .",
    "however , if we assume that @xmath161 , @xmath41 , and @xmath46 are independent of the angular component of @xmath2 , then we can consider a purely radial model for the dynamics and consider an shs whose continuous state space is the positive real axis .",
    "more generally , consider the following : consider the system @xmath162 , where we assume @xmath163 , and define @xmath164 and further assume that the system @xmath165 is ergodic on sets of constant radius , then we can use the monotonicity results of lemma  [ lem : monotone ] to show , for example , that if the one - dimensional system @xmath166 has finite - time blowups w.p .  1 ,",
    "then so does the system @xmath167 , and similarly for the converse statement : any moments of @xmath168 that are finite are also finite for @xmath162 .",
