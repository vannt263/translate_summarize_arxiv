    "the quest for the realization of different topological states of matter marks one of the major challenges in quantum many - body physics . a well established concept for the generation of two - dimensional topologically ordered",

    "the prime example is the fractional quantum hall effect , where strong magnetic fields generate landau levels  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lattice models without landau levels have been proposed for the realization of topological bands  @xcite .",
    "notably , spin - orbit coupling has emerged as an experimentally promising tool for band structures with topological invariants  @xcite . in this letter , we show that dipolar interactions , exhibiting intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , can be exploited for the realization of topological bands with cold polar molecules .    in cold gases experiments , the phenomenon that dipolar interactions exhibit",
    "spin - orbit coupling is at the heart of demagnetization cooling  @xcite , and has been identified as the driving mechanism for the einstein - de haas effect in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite and the pattern formation in spinor condensates  @xcite .",
    "dipolar relaxation was proposed as a mechanism to reach the quantum hall regime by the controlled insertion of orbital angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that dipolar spin - orbit coupling can be observed in band structures realized with polar molecules  @xcite .",

    "the main idea is based on polar molecules trapped in a two - dimensional deep optical lattice with quenched tunneling between the sites .",
    "the relevant degree of freedom of the polar molecules is given by two different rotational excitations which can be transferred between different lattice sites due to the dipolar exchange interaction .",
    "we demonstrate that the band structure for such an excitation is characterized by a chern number which depends on the underlying lattice structure .",
    "in particular , we find that the system on a square lattice gives rise to chern number @xmath0 , while a rich phase diagram appears on the honeycomb lattice . ideally , the setup is initialized with one polar molecule per lattice site , but we demonstrate that the topological properties are robust , even if nearly half of the molecules are randomly removed .",
    "in contrast to non - interacting fermions , free bosons can not form a topological insulator .",
    "however , the bosonic excitations in our system are subject to a hard - core constraint . such a setup in combination with flat bands",
    "is then expected to give rise to a fractional chern insulator at @xmath3 filling in @xmath0 topological bands  @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of our realization , using the spin - orbit coupling present in dipolar interactions , are its robustness and the low experimental requirements , while many alternative theoretical proposals with cold gases require strong spatially inhomogeneous laser fields with variations on the scale of one lattice constant  @xcite ; by using such ideas in combination with dipolar exchange interactions , it is also possible to engineer flat @xmath0 bands  @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that the system is robust against missing molecules . for certain parameters we obtain flat bands , providing a promising candidate for the realization of hard - core bosonic fractional chern insulators . </S>"
