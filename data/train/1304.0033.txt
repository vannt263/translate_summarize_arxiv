    "after the discovery of a standard model higgs boson - like particle  @xcite at the lhc  @xcite , the measurement its spin is the next step in arriving at a more complete picture of this discovery . there is a theoretical prejudice from lorentz invariance against spin @xmath2  @xcite as the particle is observed in the decay to photons , which leaves scalar @xmath3 as the well - defined option in terms of our current understanding of perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "there is a known caveat in analyzing spin hypotheses @xmath4 that arises when we investigate tensor particles and beyond . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is no well - behaved qft which predicts the interactions of such a state with sm matter from first principles . in particular",
    ", there are certain indirect constraints on the spin @xmath5 options if we take into account the non - observation of large excesses in @xmath6 final states ( @xmath7 ) at the lhc so far , while there is consistency in @xmath8 with the sm within errors .",
    "the latter implies that the observed particle is involved in the unitarization of @xmath9 scattering and probably provides the dominant share to the saturation of the unitarity sum rules . in simple realizations ,",
    "this can not be achieved with a spin 2 particle  @xcite and the worsened unitarity problem in longitudinal gauge boson scattering would manifest in a large cross section in the @xmath6 final state at large invariant masses .    on the other hand , we can perform spin analyses beyond indirect constraints in model - independent ways in the fully reconstructible final states @xmath10  .",
    "many of the direct measurement analysis strategies originate from similar questions addressed in hadron physics  @xcite .",
    "doing so , one typically treats the @xmath11  decay independent from  @xmath11 production .",
    "indeed , recent lhc measurements along these lines seem to favor @xmath12 searches  @xcite .    however , treating the resonance s decay independent from its production does not allow one to draw a more complete picture of higgs couplings because momentum dependencies are typically encoded in off - shell effects that can not be studied in this way .",
    "it is precisely the momentum dependence of higher dimensional operators that leaves footprints in the @xmath13 channel  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the @xmath14 channel gauge bosons in the weak boson fusion ( wbf ) topologies are always virtual . in this sense , adapted search strategies for the @xmath13 selection do not only provide additional sensitivity , which can be used in a global spin hypothesis test across various channels , but also include orthogonal information that can not be accessed via more traditional spin measurements .    in this letter",
    "we show that the global energy flow structure that follows from typical representatives of alternative spin structures provides a highly sensitive observable to study these properties .",
    "we select combinations of couplings , right from the beginning , that lead to a sm higgs - like phenomenology . as refs .",
    "@xcite explain , the `` tagging '' jet kinematics in @xmath13 final states can be a strong discriminant for the spin of the produced particle  @xmath11 . it should be noted that this typically results from the involved ( higher - dimensional ) operator structures , which are determined by the spin hypotheses . with this in mind , we specifically analyze spin 2 models that have @xmath15 distributions similar to the sm higgs  @xcite . in doing so , we complement the analyzes of  @xcite by answering how much sensitivity hides beyond the tagging jet level and how it carries over to experimental reality",
    ".    we will also investigate the strategy s prospects for heavier `` higgs '' masses .",
    "this latter point is motivated by the fact that similar questions , as to those we currently face for the 125 gev particle , will arise if additional higgs - like states are discovered in the future .",
    "such states are predicted by many extensions of the sm higgs sector .",
    "sample feynman diagrams that contribute to @xmath13 production via gluon fusion ( a ) and weak boson fusion ( b ) .",
    "we do not show the @xmath11 decay.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the azimuthal angle between the two tagging jets in the @xmath1 selection @xmath16  @xcite defined according to rapidity @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 , is known to be a highly sensitive observable to the @xmath0  quantum numbers of the produced @xmath11  state .",
    "this finding is not limited to the wbf channels  @xcite , but is known to also work in the gluon fusion channel  @xcite .",
    "the latter production mechanism can give rise to @xmath0  odd higgs production via tree - level @xmath0  odd couplings to the heavy fermion sector , fig .",
    "[ fig : feyngraphs ] .",
    "such a state is typically present in any non - singlet higgs sector extension that feature fields transforming in non - trivial representations under su(2)@xmath20 . in the light of recent measurements ,",
    "the fields of these extensions need to be heavier , with suppressed cross sections .",
    "another way to understand the sensitivity encoded in @xmath16 is that the amplitude as a whole is sensitive to the @xmath0  quantum numbers .",
    "hence , any additional @xmath0-preserving qcd leg that is attached to diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyngraphs ] will still give rise to an amplitude which encodes the @xmath0-specific properties reflected in @xmath16 for two - jet configurations .",
    "as a result , the entire qcd activity that results from the hard interactions in fig .  [ fig : feyngraphs ] can be considered a probe of the produced state  @xmath11 .",
    "finding the `` proper '' jets of fig .",
    "[ fig : feyngraphs ] that reflect the nature of the produced state in a multi - jet environment amounts to a combinatorial and quantum - interference  governed problem ; this results in reduced sensitivity in the @xmath21 selection  @xcite .",
    "a way to circumvent this was outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite : since qcd radiation implies energy - momentum flow , the entire energy distribution in the detector ( upon reconstructing and removing  @xmath11 from the list of calorimeter hits ) can be expected to provide a superior discriminant compared to @xmath16 in an inclusive selection . the energy momentum flow of an lhc event is commonly quantified by means of hadronic event shape observables  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "@xcite found an increase in sensitivity that follows from investigating event shapes for discrete @xmath0  measurements .",
    "still remains the observable of choice for mixed @xmath0  states , which can be straightforwardly extracted by fitting trigonometrical functions for an essentially background - free selection  @xcite .",
    "this procedure only becomes available at high integrated luminosities . ]",
    "the interplay between event shapes and higgs physics was further studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently in refs .",
    "@xcite a substantial discriminative power was revealed in the @xmath1 final state for different spin hypotheses @xmath22 .",
    "this sensitivity is driven by the energy - dependence of operators which mimic the higgs boson s interactions .",
    "the differences in the observed phenomenology can be manifold and depends on the specific higher spin scenario that one investigates . however",
    ", a rather generic finding is that spin 1 and 2 operators tend to populate the central region of the detector , thus leading to a departure from a wbf - like signature ; consequentially central jet vetos  @xcite need to be relaxed to be sensitive to such an event topology .",
    "this means that backgrounds need to be suppressed by a combination of stiff @xmath23 vetos  @xcite and state - of - the - art signal vs. background ( @xmath24 ) discriminators , such as the matrix element method  @xcite , depending on the final state .    in the following",
    "we will consider @xmath1 with  @xmath11 decay to fully leptonic taus for a toy - level signal vs. background study to compare the performance of various event shape - based observables .",
    "the details of the higgs reconstruction are inconsequential in this comparison , as all observables are affected in the same way , and the higgs candidate does not enter our analysis apart from reconstructing the signal within a window cut around the candidate mass of @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we do not include any tau reconstruction efficiencies that can also vary across the different exclusive tau decay modes @xcite .",
    "we also note that our analysis strategy is insensitive to the specifics of the `` higgs '' decay channel , and our methods straightforwardly generalize to other decay channels such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath26 selection .",
    "for the purpose of comparability , we closely follow ref .  @xcite . we model our signal hypotheses with a combination of  @xcite and  @xcite . for the simulation of the backgrounds",
    "we generate matched events with  @xcite and in the following limit ourselves to the @xmath27jets and @xmath28jets backgrounds  @xcite ; normalizing these event samples to the nnlo  @xcite and nlo cross sections  @xcite , respectively .",
    "+      +      +      +      +         +      +      +      +      +    we apply a typical wbf selection  @xcite and cluster jets with the anti - kt algorithm  @xcite as implemented in  @xcite with @xmath29 and define jets with the thresholds @xmath30 we impose an invariant mass cut on the two hardest tagging jets in the event of @xmath31 and reconstruct the higgs from taus with @xmath32 within a 50 gev window around 125 gev .",
    "the higgs candidate has to fall between the tagging jets @xmath33 we further suppress the @xmath34+jets background by imposing a central @xmath23 veto with an efficiency of @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the additional signal reduction due to mistagging is negligible within the approximations we make . when normalizing _ all signal samples to the sm higgs cross section _ after cuts ( _",
    "i.e. _ we treat the @xmath5 hypotheses as higgs - lookalikes ) we have signal cross sections @xmath36  fb . the combined background is @xmath37  fb .",
    "we proceed further by setting up two different track - selections that eventually enter the evaluation of the considered event shape observables .",
    "one of which is more robust against pile - up that can cause issues when we want to study the global event properties in the context of this paper .",
    "a.   [ en : i ] for the events that pass the above selection criteria we feed all calorimeter hits with @xmath38  gev and @xmath39 into the definition of the event shapes .",
    "this amounts to the most inclusive definition of the event shapes that is possible in the light of the above cuts .",
    "selecting events according to the requirements eq .",
    "( [ eq : selectiona])-([eq : selection2 ] ) is already at odds with continuous globalness  @xcite , which guarantees good resummation properties @xcite .",
    "however , the used selection is the most inclusive possible in the light of unavoidable signal vs. background discrimination . to this end",
    ", we note that the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite also shows that matched shower mcs reproduce the analytically resummed results well , so that we can expect our simulation to be under sufficient control .",
    "quite obviously , this selection will be affected by pile - up activity .",
    "b.   the pile - up conditions for @xmath40  tev will need to be assessed when the lhc turns on again , but it can be expected that pile - up suppression in the central part of the detector is going to allow to lower jet thresholds in the rapidity region of the tracker @xmath41  @xcite . currently , there is no tracking available for the more forward rapidity regions , so we will need to rely on hard jets to reduce in- and out - of time pile - up and underlying event .",
    "+ to reflect the effect of pile - up suppression to achieve a more robust definition of our observables we modify our event selection .",
    "we cluster jets as before , with the anti - kt algorithm and @xmath29 , but this time we use the constituents of the jets obeying @xmath42 as input for the event shapes instead of all particle tracks as considered in ( [ en : i ] ) .",
    "this also allows one to enhance pile - up suppression by _",
    "e.g. _ using the method of ref .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly require additional jet activity ( specifically @xmath43 ) which probes the spin structure induced radiation pattern .",
    "since we are requiring at least three jets according to these modified criteria , the sensitivity we will find can be straightforwardly enhanced by including sensitivity from @xmath16 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( or equivalently @xmath46 ) for the _ exclusive _ two jet category @xcite in a hybrid observable approach .",
    "we find cross sections for these cuts of @xmath47  fb , while the background remains unchanged .    for the spin 2 hypothesis @xmath48 where @xmath49 is",
    "the spin 2 resonance and @xmath50 is the energy - momentum tensor for the ew gauge bosons , gluons and fermions , we consider two representative scenarios  @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 : :     the ordinary graviton - like tensor particle paradigm ( _ i.e. _    @xmath52 ) , as considered in many other    publications ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , has jet kinematics in    the @xmath13 final state that are close to the sm higgs ,    once the additional selection cuts are imposed  @xcite .",
    "the tagging    jets are well - separated in @xmath53 and their    @xmath15 distribution is not too different from the sm higgs    boson .",
    "@xmath54 : :     we also study a model which has considerably harder jets while the    wbf rapidity gap ( and hence wbf - likeness ) is still preserved .",
    "this    specific model constrains the tensor couplings to weak bosons and    fermions ( _ i.e. _ @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "this specific operator    selection is therefore a less `` reasonable '' representative of a spin    2 higgs - lookalike .",

    "[ cls : inc ] and [ cls : pilk ] ; this provides a statistically well - defined estimate of the luminosity ( upon dividing out all reconstruction efficiencies ) that is required to reject the spin 2 hypotheses at the @xmath57  sigma level using the cl@xmath58 method  @xcite .",

    "these observables are robust against pile - up as discussed in ( ii ) .",
    "[ cls : pilk ] , however , also shows that , when the jet kinematics become sm - like , this will be reflected in a lower sensitivity of the event shapes to the involved spin hypothesis .",
    "this especially holds when discriminative power at smaller broadening is lost due to soft radiation not taken into account for selection  ( ii )  vs.  ( i ) .",
    "this also explains our initial choice of the spin 2 hypotheses : @xmath60 is characterized by soft radiation and therefore suitable to be studied using event shape observables .",
    "we find broadening observables to provide the strongest statistical sensitivity .",
    "however , while this model can be formidably constrained using event shapes if pile - up is under sufficient control , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the actual selection can be chosen closer to  ( i ) , the discriminative power of the broadening observables is severely reduced for selection  ( ii ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath59 which has a slightly harder spectrum is robust in our comparison  ( i )  vs  ( ii ) and the event shape observables provide a statistically appealing single - valued discriminant .",
    "let us finally comment on the prospect of using the methods of the previous section also in the context of spin analyses of higgs - like states that might be discovered in the future with a heavier mass .",
    "this is not immediately clear since the higher mass scale implies a different ( soft ) radiation pattern . as a representative example",
    "we discuss @xmath61  gev .",
    "in general we can expect relatively small couplings of this additional state to the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as current measurements seem to suggest that unitarity cancellations , which characteristically determine the couplings of additional massive scalars with corresponding couplings , are saturated by the 125  gev state .",
    "the standard technique in @xmath64 @xcite might hence not be applicable and an investigation of the @xmath13 final state could well be the only phenomenologically available channel to constrain the spin and structure of such a discovery .",

    "e.g. _ warped extra dimensions ( and their dual interpretation as vectorial and axial vector resonances of a strongly - interacting sector ) is therefore heavily suppressed in the sm vector boson final states .",
    "there is an exception to the unitarity argument which are @xmath66 interactions as determined in the generalized landau yang theorem @xcite .",
    "the structure of the interaction vertices does not introduce an energy - dependent unitarity violation and hence , is not constrained by current measurements .",

    "furry s theorem @xcite guarantees the exact cancellation of vector current from @xmath68 hypothesis in @xmath69 .",
    "axial vector currents still have to obey the landau yang theorem @xcite .",
    "this renders an observation of prompt gluon fusion impossible ; on - shell production exactly vanishes and gluon fusion becomes a function of the @xmath70 particle s width and the virtuality of the gluon .",
    "these small effects are at odds with conventional bump searches and leave gluon fusion , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyngraphs ] ( a ) , as the only production mechanism when such a state has suppressed couplings to the sm @xmath62 s ( these couplings are again determined by the generalized landau yang theorem ) . while the particle @xmath11 , in fig .",

    "typical qcd background suppression will however always be centered around the cuts of the previous section , independent of the specific exclusive decay channel of @xmath11 . from the shown distributions",
    "it is clear that there is substantial discriminative power in separating the scalar options from @xmath74 and @xmath60 in the event shape observables .",
    "a combination with ordinary jet - based observables such as @xmath16 will serve to discriminate these options further for tighter selections if feasible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : heavyb ] we finally show the comparison of the quark channels for the @xmath75 vs. @xmath76 , which also provides insights how different partonic channels ( and hence effective operators ) will influence our findings .",

    "[ fig : heavy ] for the scalar boson ; we can therefore expect that the event shapes also serve to discriminate between @xmath77 and @xmath78 for various spin template combinations , beyond the approximations we have made .",

    ", @xmath59 provides a better alternative hypothesis than @xmath60 when such a measurement is performed in the future .",
    "the recent discovery of a higgs - like particle at the lhc and further measurements of it seem to suggest that we have indeed discovered a particle which is consistent with the @xmath80 sm higgs boson prediction .",
    "analyses with increased statistics across many different channels will allow to answer the @xmath81 question more reliably .",
    "the @xmath1 mode , when analyzed in inclusive selections , provides a valuable channel to discriminate between different spin ( and @xmath0 ) hypotheses when the events global qcd energy - momentum flow pattern is analyzed .",
    "the latter is most efficiently captured in event shape distributions .",
    "while thrust provides a straightforward handle to discriminate discrete @xmath0  values  @xcite , the broadening observables reflect the spin - induced radiation patterns .",
    "issues that may arise from challenging pile - up conditions can be counteracted with adopted definitions of the event shape observables and hybrid exclusive / inclusive definitions of the employed single valued discriminants .",
    "depending on the spin 2 scenario ( no spin 2 scenario is theoretically motivated but merely invoked as an alternative hypothesis to be excluded ) we find large discriminative power in the accompanied energy momentum flow .",
    "this generalizes the results of refs.@xcite .",
    "pile - up , as for many analyses , can become a challenge of the discussed analysis strategy to the point where discriminative power in all collider observables is lost in the @xmath13 final state .",
    "this again highly depends on the chosen hypothesis .",
    "given the consistency of the observed cross sections in @xmath82 with the sm higgs boson , it is likely that spin analyses of an additional resonance as predicted by many bsm scenarios can not be straightforwardly performed in the @xmath83 channels .",
    "in this case an event shape based analysis of the qcd energy momentum flow might be crucial since it does not rely on a particular exclusive final state decay of @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , we find significant discriminative power of the event shape observables for heavier `` higgs '' masses , which allows to discriminate various @xmath81 hypotheses in combination with exclusive @xmath84-jet measurements in the same channel @xcite . as shown in this work , the advantages of event shape - based analyses are not limited to the study of pure qcd events but clearly generalize to the interplay of qcd with the ( bsm ) electroweak sector .",

    "<S> after the discovery of a higgs - like particle at the lhc , the determination of its spin quantum numbers across different channels will be the next step in arriving at a more precise understanding of the new state and its role in electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> event shape observables have been shown to provide extremely sensitive observables for the discrimination of the scalar higgs boson s @xmath0  quantum numbers as a consequence of the different radiation patterns of higgs production via gluon fusion vs. weak boson fusion in the @xmath1 selection . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a similar strategy serves to constrain the spin quantum numbers of the discovered particle as a function of the involved couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the prospects of applying a similar strategy to future discoveries of higgs - like particles . </S>"
