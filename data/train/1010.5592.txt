    "astrophysical blackholes manifest their presence only gravitationally .",

    "black hole accretion is usually subsonic .",
    "the inner boundary condition imposed by the event horizon is determined by the requirement that the flow will be of a supersonic nature very close to the accretor .",
    "black hole accretion , thus , usually demonstrates transonic behaviour in general .",
    "such physical transonic accretion solutions can mathematically be realized as critical solutions on the phase portraits of the local radial mach number and the radial distance measured from the event horizon @xcite . to maintain physical transonicty such critical points",
    "will perforce have to be saddle points , which will enable a solution to pass through themselves . in this connection ,",
    "a  multi - critical \" flow refers to the category of the accretion configuration which can have more than one critical points accessible to the flow solution . for low angular momentum axisymmetric black hole accretion",
    ", it may so happen that the critical features are exhibited more than once in the phase portrait of a stationary solution describing such flows , and accretion consequently becomes multi - critical @xcite .    in reality , such weakly rotating sub - keplerian flows",
    "are indeed exhibited in various physical situations , such as detached binary systems fed by accretion from ob stellar winds ( @xcite ) , semi - detached low - mass non - magnetic binaries (  @xcite ) , and super - massive black holes fed by accretion from slowly rotating central stellar clusters ( @xcite and references therein ) . even for a standard keplerian accretion disc",
    ", turbulence may produce such low angular momentum flows ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "all of the aforementioned multi - critical flow dynamics are important in the astrophysical context .",
    "such multi - critical behaviour allows the formation of standing shocks in low angular momentum axisymmetric black hole accretion  @xcite .",
    "standing shocks in rotating astrophysical accretion potentially provide an important and efficient mechanism for conversion of a significant amount of the gravitational energy into radiation by randomizing the directed infall motion of the accreting fluid .",
    "shocks play an important role in governing the overall dynamical and radiative processes taking place in astrophysical fluid flows around black holes .",
    "originally at a large distance , subsonic accretion encounters the outermost saddle type critical point and becomes supersonic .",
    "subjected to the appropriate perturbative environment , such a supersonic flow encounters a shock and becomes subsonic again .",
    "the resulting flow has to pass through another saddle type critical point to meet the inner boundary condition as imposed by the event horizon .",
    "for accretion onto a black hole , the presence of at least two saddle type critical points is , therefore , a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the shock formation .",
    "so multi - critical flow behaviour plays a crucial role in studying the physics of shock formation and related astrophysical phenomena .    to understand the phase - space behaviour of low angular momentum shocked multi - transonic accretion",
    ", one usually constructs the corresponding autonomous dynamical systems analogue , and then identifies the saddle type critical points of the phase trajectories of the flow .",
    "next , the global understanding of the flow topologies are performed which necessitates a complete numerical investigation of the non - linear stationary equations describing the velocity phase space behaviour of the flow .",
    "it is , however , still possible to semi - quantitatively realize the global behaviour of the transonic solution without taking resort to numerical techniques . getting equipped with the mathematical formalisms of the general dynamical systems approach",
    ", it has recently been possible to conceive a clear analytical conception of some of the global behaviours of the flow by analyzing the local features of the critical points @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that along with understanding the critical point behaviour of the stationary accretion solution , it is also necessary to ensure that such stationary configuration are stable .",
    "this can be accomplished by studying the time evolution of a linear acoustic - like perturbation ( around the stationary configuration ) in the full time - dependent flow equations . considering a hydrostatically balanced flow in vertical equilibrium",
    ", it has recently been observed that for accretion onto a non rotating black hole under the influence of various pseudo - schwarzschild black hole potentials , the characteristic features of the time development of the aforementioned perturbation ensures the stability of the stationary configuration @xcite . the result obtained in this way",
    "was shown to be independent of the choice of the black hole potentials used to study accretion flow around a non rotating black hole .",
    "this work @xcite , however , was performed for a particular type of flow geometry  hydrostatically balanced flow under the vertical equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , accretion processes onto astrophysical black holes are also studied for two other different flow geometries  flow with constant disc height , and flow under the conical equilibrium @xcite(see section 2 for further detail about these two disc models ) .",
    "those two flow geometries are relatively simpler to handle ( in comparison to the flow configuration under the vertical equilibrium ) without compromising the essential physics involved in the multi - transonic black hole accretion phenomena . in addition , these two flows are appropriate to study the low angular momentum inviscid flow configuration as well .",
    "it is thus instructive to investigate whether the stationary configurations remain stable ( under perturbation ) in these flow geometries as well . in other words",
    ", one needs to realize whether the stationary critical solutions are stable irrespective of the nature of the space time ( choice of the black hole potential ) as well as the flow geometry ( structure of the accretion disc ) .",
    "this is precise objective of this work .",
    "the stationary and the time - dependent low angular momentum axisymmetric accretion around a schwarzschild black hole , under the influence of a generalized pseudo - newtonian black - hole potential in different flow geometries , have been analyzed .",
    "the stationary solutions have been considered to investigate their critical point behaviour , and to categorize systematically the nature of the critical points which appear in such flows .",
    "this is followed by a perturbative study of the full time - dependent flow , to follow the evolution of the perturbation and make predictions about the stability of the stationary configuration .",
    "finally , observations have also been made about the nature of the acoustic metric embedded inside the flow .",
    "when considering a rotating , axisymmetric , inviscid steady flow , the two most pertinent equations are the ones determining the drift in the radial direction ( essentially euler s equation ) , @xmath0 and the equation of continuity , @xmath1 in which , @xmath2 is the generalised pseudo - newtonian potential driving the flow ( with the prime denoting a spatial derivative ) , @xmath3 is the conserved angular momentum of the flow , @xmath4 is the pressure of the flowing gas and @xmath5 is the local thickness of the disc , respectively .",
    "the two foregoing equations give the steady continuum distribution of the velocity field , @xmath6 , and the density field , @xmath7 . but to close the two equations it will also be necessary to prescribe the functional dependences of both @xmath4 and @xmath8 on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which , in the steady state regime , will imply an ultimate dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "following this requirement , the pressure , @xmath4 , is first prescribed by an equation of state for the flow  @xcite . as a general polytropic it is given as @xmath12 , while for an isothermal flow the pressure is given by @xmath13 , in all of which",

    "this can vary in many ways , with different degrees of complexity  @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "one could treat @xmath8 to be just a constant , i.e. the disc is of uniform thickness . in the case of the conical flow  @xcite",

    "physically this is what it has to be , because it is the third critical point ( saddle ) which will allow the transonic flow solution from infinity to the event horizon , and here , following the line of argument in @xcite , it can be stated that the stationary flow solution has to settle on the separatices of a saddle point only .",
    "that is why among the critical points , only the saddle points are termed as sonic points , and not the centre - type points , although for both the types of critical points the flow speed is equal to the sound speed , i.e. mach number becomes unity .",
    "so if the value of @xmath3 is increased from a sufficiently low value , first there will a span of single saddle point ( solid line in the figure ) then the bifurcation occurs resulting in a pair of centre - type points ( with intermediate value @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath109 ) and a new saddle point ( location @xmath110 ) so that the older saddle point becomes the outermost critical point ( location @xmath111 ) . before @xmath3 attains a certain value , the relation @xmath102 ( for isothermal case @xmath112 ) is maintained and for this interval of @xmath3 , the @xmath81 functions for the three critical points are plotted with dotted lines . here",
    "the separatrices of the newly formed saddle point encompasses the centre - type point , forming a homoclinic connection ; after exceeding this value of @xmath3 , what happens is that @xmath102 , and the homoclinic connection for the inner saddle opens up , giving rise to the same sort of homoclinic connection from the outer saddle . within this phase , the function of @xmath81 is depicted with small dashed curves . at the end of this domain of @xmath3 ,",
    "the centre - type and the outer saddle point coalesce and  destroy \" each other , after which , only the inner saddle point exists with increasing value of @xmath3 ( solid curves ) .",
    "the scenario in the isothermal case is almost similar .",
    "there is an interesting situation along the boundary between the two subregions within the wedge shaped region corresponding to multicritical points . for these parameter values @xmath113 , and",
    "thus two saddle points will be linked by a heteroclinic connection of their separatrices ; for the @xmath3 just below this value there is some homoclinic connection for the inner saddle point , and just above this value the homoclinic connection corresponds to the outer critical points . from the point of view of a general dynamical system along this boundary , a type of bifurcation occurs that may be termed as a heteroclinic one .",
    "the boundaries of the region in the parameter space permitting multicritical points , as it has been discussed already , are associated with saddle - centre bifurcation or merging of a pair of roots of the equations ( eq.[aitchconst]-[aitchpol ] , [ aitchiso1]-[critconiso ] ) needed for determining the critical points under various conditions discussed above",
    ". now all these equations are polynomial equations .",
    "the discriminant of a general polynomial , @xmath114 can be expressed as in terms of its roots , @xmath115 s , as @xmath116 the discriminant may be expressed as the determinant of a matrix called sylvester matrix ( http://mathworld.wolfram.com/polynomialdiscriminant.html and other references therein ) , @xmath117,\\ ] ] up to a factor . hence it is expected that @xmath118 will be zero on the abovementioned boundaries and actually it is so . here",
    "the contour plot of @xmath119 value for the polytropic flow in constant height geometry ( i.e. for the polynomial in @xmath120 in eq.[aitchconst ] ) in @xmath108@xmath3 space is shown in fig.[fig : contour ] .",
    "the curve exactly conforms with the corresponding boundary curve ( in small dashed style ) in fig.[fig : adibound ] , drawn on the basis of the numerical method of detailed root finding .",
    "so this procedure may be thought of as a much easier alternative to find the multicritical parametric values .     for @xmath121.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    considering now the question of actual accretion process , from eq.[dvdrpolaitch ] it is evident that for conical and constant height model the critical points are actual sonic points , though these two are not exactly same for the other model.as for all parameter values there will always be one critical ( sonic ) point with separatrices spanning from infinity to the event horizon , there will always exist a transonic solution .",
    "but the features of the critical points in all the three models opens the possibility of multitransonic accretion too within the region with multicritical points under certain conditions .",
    "first , there should be some transition from the supersonic branch of the non - homoclinic separatrices ( trajectory ) of the critical point ( sonic point ) with global transonic solution to the subsonic branch of the homoclinic solution of the other sonic point at a particular value of @xmath11 .",
    "secondly there should be some quantity which will discriminate between the trajectories of these two sonic points .",
    "for such a transition one such possibility is the occurrence of a shock , which may take place obeying the condition @xmath102 for the polytropic case ( and @xmath112 for the isothermal condition ) . after making the transition",
    ", the flow will pass through the corresponding inner sonic point .",
    "the determination of the exact location and the exact parameter values for such a transition really taking place is out of the scope of the present paper , but here it is touched upon to indicated that this full analysis keeps alive the possibility for such types of multitransonic accretion , irrespective of the disc geometries and equations of state .",
    "the time - dependent generalisation of the continuity condition for an axisymmetric pseudo - schwarzschild disc is given as @xmath122 in which the surface density of the disc , @xmath123 , is to be expressed as @xmath124  @xcite . from the foregoing expression ,",
    "one can , therefore , obtain @xmath125 defining a new variable @xmath126 , it is quite obvious from the form of eq .",
    "( [ surden ] ) that the stationary value of @xmath127 will be a constant , @xmath128 , which can be closely identified with the matter flux rate .",
    "this follows a similar approach to spherically symmetric flows made by  @xcite and  @xcite . for an axisymmetric disc , which has no dependence on any angle variable ,",
    "this approach has also been adopted for a flow driven simply by a newtonian potential  @xcite .",
    "the present treatment , of course , is of a more general nature , the disc flow being driven by a general pseudo - newtonian potential , @xmath129 for all disk geometries . in this system , a perturbation prescription of the form @xmath130 and @xmath131 , will give , on linearising in the primed quantities , @xmath132 which is a relation that connects all the three fluctuating quantities , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , with one another ( here the subscript @xmath136 denotes stationary background values in all the cases ) .",

    ", it is immediately possible to set down an effective metric for the propagation of an acoustic disturbance as @xmath162 which can be shown to be entirely identical to the metric of a wave equation for a scalar field in curved space - time , obtained through a somewhat different approach  @xcite .",

    "from the perspective of the propagation of acoustic waves ( carrying information in any fluid system ) in the accretion disc , what can be concluded from these arguments is that the disc geometry and the equation of state act together in determining the speed of information propagation . in the case of the disc being supported by hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction ,",
    "if the flow is polytropic , then the speed of information propagation will be less than the speed of sound by a factor , @xmath165 .",

    "in all the other cases , transonicity will , however , take place when @xmath166 .",

    "the primary motivation behind this work , as has already been mentioned , is to study the transonic properties and the stability issues of low angular momentum axisymmetric black hole accretion from a dynamical systems point of view .",
    "flows around a non rotating black hole in three possible geometries , namely , the constant height , the conical equilibrium and the hydrostatically balanced vertical equilibrium respectively , have been studied under the influence of a generalized pseudo - schwarzschild black hole potential .",
    "both polytropic as well as the isothermal equation of state have been used to describe the flow .",
    "the analytical formalism provided here ensures that even without performing explicit numerical integration along the streamlines , a reasonably clear picture of the behaviour of the phase trajectories of the flow can be well apprehended .",
    "this work , thus , can be considered as a crucial alternative approach to understand the behaviour of non - exactly solvable coupled differential equations describing autonomous dynamical systems , as they are to usually encountered while studying the accretion processes around compact astrophysical objects .",
    "the stationary critical solutions , as well as the stability criteria of such stationary configurations have been analyzed .",
    "for stationary structure , one finds that the general profile of the parameter space marking the multi - critical flow solution remains unaltered for all three flow geometries , as well as for every black hole potential available in the literature",
    ". the corresponding numerical domain of @xmath168 $ ] , for which the multi - criticality has been observed , is , however , different for different disc geometries , as well as for different potentials for a particular equation of state .",
    "@xcite proposed that the three different disc models , namely constant height flow , flow in conical equilibrium and in vertical equilibrium should be identical , provided one can change the polytropic constant in certain ways . in this way they suggested that a relativistic flow of constant height might have same properties as an isothermal flow in two other geometries .",
    "this is , however , not true .",
    "one is able to argue that it is not possible to allow accretion under various flow geometries identically by merely changing the polytropic index of the flow , since the shift from one flow geometry to another is a non - continuous transformation in a multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "hence , it is certainly not a mathematically consistent approach to establish an equivalence between the polytropic flow in one type of disc geometry to the isothermal flow in the other by making a @xmath15 transformation , since the corresponding first integrals of motion for the flow , derived on using the two different equations of state ( polytropic / adiabatic and isothermal ) imply distinctively different physical properties .",
    "the mach number relation at the critical point differentiate the flow in vertical equilibrium ( @xmath169 for polytropic flow ) from the two other kinds of flow ( constant height flow and the flow under conical equilibrium ) , for which the critical point and the sonic point are identical ( i.e. , @xmath170 ) , upon using both the equations of state .",
    "the result @xmath169 is a consequence of the effective speed of the propagation of the linear acoustic perturbation ( sound speed ) due to the presence of the polytropic sound speed @xmath171 in the expression of the disc height ( which , in other words , is a direct repercussion of the vertical equilibrium assumption itself ) .",
    "the stability properties of the aforesaid stationary configuration have been realized by perturbing ( about the stationary configuration ) the full time - dependent flow equations in various disc geometries , under various black hole potentials , and then by observing the time evolution of such perturbations .",
    "the general form of the wave equations corresponding to the dynamics of such perturbations , as well as the related acoustic metric , are identical for any black hole potential used , but is very different for different flow geometries .",
    "however , such perturbations do not diverge in any physical sense for any kind of flow geometries .",
    "this ensures that the stability of the stationary configuration , at least for accretion around non - rotating black holes under various pseudo - schwarzschild potentials , is a generic feature independent of the nature of the space time ( the explicit form of the black hole potential ) as well as the geometric configuration of the flow ( disc structure ) .",
    "the exact forms of the corresponding acoustic metric for various disc geometries have also been derived in this work .",
    "this will help in studying the low angular momentum pseudo - schwarzschild axisymmetric black hole accretion as a natural example of analogue gravity phenomena .",
