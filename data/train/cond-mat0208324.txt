    "the investigation of the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic ultrathin films is a field of intense current interest @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we determine the magnetic in - plane anisotropy of a square two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg ferromagnet in presence of the magnetic dipole interaction . in 2d magnets",
    "the action of magnetic anisotropies is twofold .",
    "first , they induce a long range magnetization @xcite with a curie temperature of the order of the exchange coupling @xcite , whereas a strictly isotropic 2d heisenberg magnet does not exhibit any long range magnetic order at finite temperatures ( mermin - wagner - theorem ) @xcite . moreover , the long range character of the dipole interaction itself is sufficient to stabilize the magnetization in a 2d magnet .",
    "secondly , the anisotropies determine the easy and hard axes of the magnetization with respect to the lattice frame @xcite . for a ferromagnetic thin film",
    "the dipole coupling prefers an in - plane direction of the magnetization ( shape anisotropy , demagnetizing field ) . except for very small thicknesses thin films",
    "are usually in - plane magnetized .",
    "the corresponding in - plane easy axis depends on the lattice symmetry of the film face . for a rectangular ( 110 )",
    "monolayer the dipole interaction induces a uniaxial in - plane anisotropy , the easy axis being the in - plane axial direction with the smaller lattice constant , as can easily be shown by calculating the corresponding lattice sums .    on the other hand , for a _ square _ monolayer the dipole coupling ,",
    "although itself not rotational invariant , exhibits a _",
    "continuous energy degeneracy _ for classical spins at @xmath0 .",
    "thus , due to the mermin - wagner theorem a long range magnetic order is not expected at finite temperatures .",
    "however , as has been shown by monte carlo calculations and interacting spin wave theory , a magnetic ordering and a critical temperature exists for dipole coupled spins on a square lattice @xcite , since the _ magnetic excitations _ are not continuously degenerate . in this case",
    "a quartic in - plane anisotropy is present , the corresponding easy axes being the edges of the square lattice . in other words ,",
    "the density of states and thus the entropy depends on the magnetic direction within the lattice .",
    "this phenomenon is an example of the _ order - by - disorder _ effect in frustrated magnets @xcite . in these systems",
    "thermal fluctuations or lattice disturbances partly remove frustrations , and a collective magnetic ordering emerges at finite temperatures .",
    "whereas the existence of a finite magnetization and a quartic anisotropy at finite temperatures for dipole coupled spins on a square lattice has been proven , the strength and the temperature behavior of this anisotropy has not been determined yet .",
    "of particular interest is whether the dipole - coupling - induced quartic anisotropy can be measured , and how this anisotropy compares with the single - ion quartic lattice anisotropy due to the spin - orbit coupling . in this study",
    "we will adress these questions with the help of a mean field approximation , taking into account a square spin cluster with different numbers of spins ( oguchi - theory ) @xcite , as outlined in sec.ii .",
    "furthermore , we apply a many - body green s function theory within the tyablikov - decoupling ( rpa ) by considering collective magnetic excitations ( spin waves ) and interactions between them @xcite , which are in particular important for 2d magnetic systems .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in sec.iii .",
    "the free energy @xmath1 is determined within a heisenberg - type hamiltonian as a function of the temperature @xmath2 and the in - plane angle @xmath3 .",
    "a square ( 001 ) ferromagnetic monolayer is considered , which is spanned by the @xmath4- plane , the @xmath5- direction refers to @xmath6 .",

    "the spin quantum number is assumed to be @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice vector between sites @xmath9 and @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the distance .",
    "all spins are assumed to be aligned parallely ( ferromagnetic order ) , the magnetization @xmath17 is directed along the magnetic field @xmath18 .    to account for a varying angle of the magnetization with respect to the lattice frame",
    ", the lattice is rotated by the in - plane angle @xmath3 with respect to the @xmath5- axis , yielding the rotated lattice vectors : @xmath19 clearly , the only source in eq.([e1 ] ) for a possible in - plane anisotropy is the double scalar product of the dipole interaction . within the single - spin ( bragg - williams- ) mean field approximation @xcite",
    "the dipole coupling yields an additional contribution to the molecular field .",
    "the resulting single - spin hamiltonian reads    @xmath20    with @xmath21 the number of nearest neighbors ( coordination number ) , @xmath22 the strength of the dipole interaction , @xmath23 the lattice constant , @xmath24 the corresponding lattice sum @xcite , and @xmath25 the magnetization .",
    "thus , within this approximation the dipole interaction is _ isotropic _ for a square monolayer and does not depend on the in - plane angle @xmath3 .",
    "our approach will now be improved by applying the so - called oguchi method @xcite . a number @xmath26 of neighboring spins",
    "is considered , the interactions between the @xmath27 spins in this cluster are treated exactly . the remaining lattice is coupled to the spin cluster by a molecular field . to conserve the symmetry of the square lattice , we take into account only square - shaped spin clusters , the three smallest possible clusters are characterized by @xmath28 , and 16 . note that the resulting cluster hamiltonians @xmath29 are usually non - diagonal ,",
    "i.e.  contributions proportional to the @xmath30- and @xmath31- spin components may be present .",
    "therefore , as a further approximation we consider only the diagonal elements .",
    "this approach guarantees that the magnetization is directed along the external magnetic field . as an example",

    "the corresponding expressions for the other investigated sizes are rather lengthy and not shown here .",
    "the difference of the free energy @xmath38 between the diagonal ( @xmath39 ) and the axial directions ( @xmath6 ) yields the in - plane anisotropy @xmath40 , which will be calculated as a function of the temperature @xmath2 and the external magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "it is important to mention that the mean field theory as described in the preceeding subsection does not fulfill the mermin - wagner - theorem for the isotropic 2d heisenberg magnet . in this case",
    "the long range magnetic order becomes unstable against collective magnetic excitations with long wavelengths @xcite .",
    "thus , the consideration of these spin waves is very important for the magnetic behavior of a ferromagnetic monolayer . for the determination of the dipole - coupling - induced in - plane anisotropy",
    "we apply in addition a many - body green s function theory to the hamiltonian eq.([e1 ] ) , after the lattice is rotated by the in - plane angle @xmath3 , eq.([e1a ] ) .",
    "we consider the green s functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , which are solved within the tyablikov - decoupling @xcite .",
    "since interactions between spin waves are partly taken into account , the magnetic properties can be determined up to the curie temperature by this method .",

    "an energetic influence should become apparent at @xmath0 already within a mean field approximation .",
    "besides the effects resulting from the zero - point motion , the terms of the dipole interaction dependent on the in - plane angle @xmath3 cancel for a strictly square magnetic lattice , i.e.   for a fully saturated ferromagnetic state . at finite temperatures",
    "thermal fluctuations disturb this square periodicity , causing an effective quartic in - plane magnetic anisotropy , which reflects the underlying spatial lattice symmetry .",
    "the single - spin mean field theory conserves the periodicity of the square magnetic lattice , since all other spin operators are replaced by uniform expectation values .",
    "thus , within this approximation one obtains @xmath68 for all temperatures . on the other hand , within the oguchi approach the interactions between a number of spins",
    "are treated exactly , considering a few collective magnetic excitations with short wavelengths ranging over several lattice constants , and resulting in a finite value for @xmath40 for @xmath69 .",
    "the many - body green s function theory takes into account spin waves with all possible wavelengths .",
    "since @xmath40 is maximal at elevated temperatures , @xmath40 is caused by magnetic fluctuations in particular with short wavelengths , which become excited in this temperature range .    within the oguchi approach we calculate a maximum value of @xmath40 of the order of 0.1% of the demagnetizing energy @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath40 as calculated from the green s function method is more than a magnitude larger , namely @xmath70 near @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , the action of a magnetic field @xmath41 on the anisotropy @xmath40 is calculated to be much more pronounced within the green s function theory than within the oguchi approach , cf .",
    "figs.1 and 2 .",
    "the reason for the strong differences between the results obtained from the two methods is that the former one considers collective magnetic excitations with long wavelengths .",
    "these are known to have strong effects on the magnetic properties of ultrathin films @xcite . in this case",
    "the magnetic field acts merely on _ spin blocks _ ,",
    "i.e.  correlated regions of neighboring spins characterized by the short range order parameter @xcite , resulting in a much larger magnetic response .",
    "for instance , the induced magnetization in a ferromagnetic trilayer has been determined to be an order of magnitude larger by consideration of spin waves @xcite .",
    "the collective magnetic excitations are most pronounced for a single magnetic layer @xcite , the zero - point motion is strongest for the spin number @xmath13 .",
    "note that the theoretical methods applied in the present study are much less demanding than monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the obtained dipole - coupling - induced in - plane anisotropy is small as compared to other ( effective ) anisotropies , since we have considered interaction strengths appropriate for @xmath48- transition metal ferromagnets .",
    "a small value for @xmath40 has been conjectured in @xcite .",
    "if a ten times larger ratio @xmath71 between the dipole coupling strength and the exchange interaction is assumed , the ratio @xmath72 increases roughly by the same factor .",
    "since usually the effective anisotropies decrease with an increasing temperature , @xmath40 might become observable at elevated temperatures . for comparison ,",
    "we show in figs.1 and 2 also the effective single - ion quartic in - plane anisotropy @xmath61 resulting from the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this quantity is calculated with the help of a thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite . by assuming its strength to be @xmath62 , and adapting corresponding curie temperatures",
    ", @xmath61 becomes comparable to @xmath40 at @xmath73 .",
    "in this temperature range the _ total _ quartic in - plane anisotropy should increase again , or exhibit an in - plane magnetic reorientation .",
    "as mentioned , this dipole - coupling - induced anisotropy should be more apparent for ferromagnetic ( 001 ) thin films with a large @xmath71- ratio .",
    "we like to comment on the fact that a finite anisotropy is obtained for @xmath56 .",
    "usually the effective anisotropy as observed for a collectively ordered ferromagnetic state vanishes above @xmath54 .",
    "however , a vanishing effective anisotropy for @xmath56 does not indicate that the anisotropy as present in the heisenberg hamiltonian disappears .",
    "a single ( paramagnetic ) spin is still subject to e.g.  the single - ion uniaxial anisotropy @xmath74 also if the net magnetization is zero .",
    "the resulting free energy difference between the easy and the hard magnetic directions ( paramagnetic anisotropy ) behaves as @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and is rather small if @xmath74 is small as compared to the exchange interaction @xmath77 . with regard to the present study ,",
    "a finite value of @xmath78 for @xmath56 reflects the dipole - coupling - induced anisotropy of a spin block @xcite .",
    "note that the free energy @xmath79 as obtained from the green s function method yields unphysical results for temperatures near and above @xmath54 . as can be shown @xcite , for large temperatures the free energy @xmath79 as calculated by this method does not approach the value @xmath80 , which is the free energy of a single , non - interacting @xmath13- spin .",
    "this unphysical behavior results in a still increasing @xmath40 for @xmath56 , cf.fig.2(b ) .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the green s function approach reflects the correct behavior of @xmath40 for @xmath81 , since its behavior is corroborated by the oguchi method and the holstein - primakoff approach .",
    "we have considered a square monolayer only .",
    "a similar effect is expected also for thicker films with a square ( 001 ) face , or for a hexagonal ( 111 ) thin film .",
    "in addition , a corresponding effect may emerge for a three - dimensional cubic lattice , for which the dipole interaction cancels exactly .",
    "at elevated temperatures , however , caused by thermal fluctuations the frustration due to this periodicity will be lifted .",
    "the dipole coupling then induces a cubic magnetic anisotropy with easy axes directed along e.g.   the edges of the cubic lattice .",
    "also is this case an increasing anisotropy with an increasing temperature is expected . to obtain an anisotropic contribution caused by the magnetic dipole interaction via the order - by - disorder effect ,",
    "we emphasize that the lattice symmetry must be strictly cubic or square . a lattice distortion e.g.due to magnetostrictive effects",
    "will probably blur this effect .",
