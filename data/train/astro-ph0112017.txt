    "recent observation of pulsars associated with supernova remnants obtained with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( weisskopf , odell & van speybroeck 1996 ) are providing an unprecedentedly detailed view of pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "for the first time , emission features involving wisps , co - aligned toroidal structures , and axial jets are fully resolved in x - rays on arcsecond scales .",
    "these features , similar to those seen from the optical crab nebula , are now found to be common to young , energetic pulsar in supernova remnants ( gotthelf 2001 ) .",
    "herein we present preliminary spectral analysis of several pwne observed with _",

    "a summary of these objects along with references and images can be found in gotthelf ( 2001 ) .",
    "all observations were obtained with the acis - ccd camera which is sensitive to x - rays in the 0.210  kev band with an energy resolution of @xmath2 at @xmath3 kev . the on - axis point spread function is slightly undersampled by the ccd pixels ( @xmath4 ) allowing us to isolate the pulsar emission from that of the nebula . except for n157b , which serendipitously fell on acis - i0",

    "we note that the pileup corrected photon indices are likely subject to change due to the preliminary nature of the pileup model implementation , and suggest caution until these issues are resolved , but expect the basic result to remain unchanged .",
    "we also note that due to extreme pileup effects and the brightness of its nebulae compared to the brightness of its core , snr  0540 - 69 has not been included pending a more detailed analysis of the available data .    as a check to our final spectral results and to look for any systematic effect due to pile - up , we compare our measured power - law indices with those obtained from the literature for the pulsed emission for each source ( figure 2 ) . although they need not be the same , it is reassuring that they agree to within measurement errors .",

    "the photon indices obtained from this analysis show a trend that the average pwne photon indices are consistently steeper than their core s photon indices by a factor of one - half to one .",
    "we suggest that this relationship is linear , with the form @xmath0",
    ". this trend may be due to a number of factors .",
    "it may imply that the synchrotron spectrum frequency break occurs close to the neutron star , that there is a fundamental difference in emission mechanisms between the two regions , or that the nebula is being powered by the core and that the steepening is due to synchrotron burnoff or a comparable aging mechanism .",
