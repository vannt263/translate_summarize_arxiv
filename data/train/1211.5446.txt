    "( in brief : cdlt ) . the cdlts arise naturally when physicists attempt to define a fundamental path integral in quantum gravity .",

    "( 2001 ) for a rigorous mathematical background behind the model of cdlts .",
    "more precisely , we analyze a quantum system on a random 2d graph @xmath0 generated by a natural  uniform \" measure on the cdlts corresponding to a",
    " critical \" regime ( see below ) .    in modern language",
    ", the spirit of the quantum mw theorem is that in a 2d lattice model ( more generally , for a model on a countable bi - dimensional graph ) , any infinite - volume gibbs state ( regardless of whether it is unique or not ) is invariant under the action of a lie group @xmath1 provided that the ingredients of local hamiltonians are @xmath1-invariant ; see mermin and wagner ( 1966 ) .",
    "these ingredients include the kinetic energy part , the single - site potential and the interaction potential .",
    "the mathematical constructions used for the proof of this theorem require a certain control over these ingredients : compactness of a configuration space associated with a single vertex of the lattice ( or a more general bi - dimensional graph ) , a certain smoothness of the interaction potential ( or its essential part ) , sufficiently fast decay of the interaction potential for large distances on the lattice ( or on the graph ) ,  regularity \" of the lattice ( graph ) geometry . in particular , the bi - dimensionality of the underlying graph is guaranteed by eqn ( 4.1.1 ) .",
    "a principal question that needs a careful consideration is about the definition of a quantum gibbs state in an infinite volume . for the so - called quantum spin systems , with a finite - dimensional phase space of a single spin ( and consequently , with bounded local hamiltonians ) , such a definition is given within the theory of kms ( kubo  martin ",
    "schwinger ) states ; see , e.g. , bratteli and robinson ( 2002 ) . a version of the mw theorem for a model of this type on a 2d square lattice was established in frhlich and pfister ( 1981 ) , pfister ( 1981 ) and has been generalised in subsequent publications . the kms - based results ( under suitable aforementioned assumptions )",
    "can be extended to the model of classical spins on a random graph of the type considered in the present paper ; cf .",
    "kelbert et al .",
    "( 2013 , @xcite )",
    ". however , the kms - theory is not efficient for the case of interacting quantum particles where the one - particle kinetic energy operator is equal to @xmath2 ( @xmath3 stands for a laplacian on a compact manifold ) .",
    "this is a standard quantum - mechanical model , and the fact that the concept of infinite - volume gibbs state did not receive so far a properly working definition for such a system was perceived as a regrettable hindrance .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the definition of an infinite - volume gibbs state ( more precisely , of an infinite - volume reduced density matrix ( rdm , for short ) ) from the papers kelbert and suhov , 2013 ( cf .",

    "it is appropriate to say that , although we use here some methodology developed in kelbert and suhov ( 2013 , @xcite and @xcite ) , the current work deals with a situation different from the above papers , and a number of issues here require specific technical tools . on the other hand ,",
