    "undoubtedly the most prominent accomplishment of modern cosmology to date has been to provide strong indirect support for the existence of both dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) from independent data sets derived from the observation of distant supernovae@xcite , the anisotropies of the cmb@xcite , the lensing effects on the propagation of light through weak gravitational fields@xcite , and the inventory of cosmic matter from the large scale structures ( lss ) of the universe@xcite .",
    "but , in spite of these outstanding achievements , modern cosmology still fails to understand the ultimate physical nature of the components that build up the mysterious dark side of the universe , most conspicuously the de component of which the first significant experimental evidence was reported @xmath7 years ago from supernovae observations .",
    "the current estimates of the de energy density yield @xmath8 and it is believed that it constitutes roughly @xmath9 of the total energy density budget for an essentially flat universe .",
    "the big question now is : what is it from the point of view of fundamental physics ?",
    "one possibility is that it is the ground state energy density associated to the quantum field theory ( qft ) vacuum and , in this case , it is traditional to associate @xmath0 to @xmath10 , where @xmath3 is the cosmological constant ( cc ) term in einstein s equations . the problem , however , is that the typical value of the ( renormalized ) vacuum energy in all known realistic qft s is much bigger than the experimental value .",
    "for example , the energy density associated to the higgs potential of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions is more than fifty orders of magnitude larger than the measured value of @xmath0 .",
    "another generic proposal ( with many ramifications ) is the possibility that the de stands for the current value of the energy density of some slowly evolving , homogeneous and isotropic scalar field ( or collection of them ) .",
    "scalar fields appeared first as dynamical adjustment mechanisms for the cc@xcite and later gave rise to the notion of quintessence@xcite . while this idea has its own merits ( specially concerning the dynamical character that confers to the de ) it has also its own drawbacks . the most obvious one (",
    "often completely ignored ) is that the vacuum energy of the sm is still there and , therefore , the quintessence field just adds up more trouble to the whole fine - tuning cc problem@xcite !    next - to - leading is the `` cosmological coincidence problem '' , or the problem of understanding why the presently measured value of the de is so close to the matter density .",
    "one expects that this problem can be alleviated by assuming that @xmath0 is actually a dynamical quantity . while quintessence is the traditionally explored option , in this paper we entertain the possibility that such dynamics could be the result of the so - called cosmological `` constants '' ( like @xmath3 , @xmath11 , ... ) being actually variable .",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that this possibility can perfectly mimic quintessence .",
    "it means that we stay with the @xmath3 parameter and make it `` running '' , for example through quantum effects@xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown that , in order to have an impact on the coincidence problem , the total de in this context should be conceived as a composite fluid made out of a running @xmath3 and another entity @xmath12 , with some effective equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath13 , such that the total de density and pressure read @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we call this system the @xmath3xcdm model@xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath12 ( called `` the cosmon '' ) is not necessarily a fundamental entity ; in particular , it need not be an elementary scalar field . as remarked in @xcite",
    ", @xmath12 could represent the effective behavior of higher order terms in the effective action ( including non - local ones ) .",
    "this is conceivable , since the bianchi identity enforces a relation between all dynamical components that enter the effective structure of the energy - momentum tensor in einstein s equations , in particular between the evolving @xmath3 and other terms that could emerge after we embed general relativity in a more general framework@xcite .",
    "therefore , at this level , we do not impose a microscopic description for @xmath12 and in this way the treatment becomes more generalcdm , xcdm and quintessence - like models .",
    "the margin for the energy densities and eos parameter @xmath13 is still quite high . in the @xmath3xcdm case ,",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is running provides an even wider range of phenomenological possibilities . ] .",
    "the only condition defining @xmath12 is the de conservation law , namely we assume that @xmath14 is the covariantly self - conserved total de density .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the combined dynamics of de and matter density perturbations for such conserved de density @xmath0 .",
    "the present study goes beyond the approximate treatment presented in @xcite , where we neglected the de perturbations and estimated the matter perturbations of the @xmath3xcdm model using an effective ( variable ) eos @xmath16 for the composite fluid @xmath17 .",
    "the main result was that a sizeable portion of parameter space was still compatible with a possible solution of the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "the `` effective approach '' that we employed in @xcite was based on three essential ingredients : i ) the use of the effective eos representation of cosmologies with variable cosmological parameters@xcite ; ii ) the calculation of the growth of matter density fluctuations using the effective eos of the de@xcite ; and iii ) the application of the , so - called , `` f - test '' to compare the model with the lss data , i.e. the condition that the linear bias parameter , @xmath18 does not deviate from the @xmath3cdm value by more than @xmath19 at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the matter power spectrum and @xmath22 is the galaxy fluctuation power spectrum@xcite ",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "this three - step methodology turned out to be an efficient streamlined strategy to further constrain the region of the original parameter space@xcite .",
    "however , there remained to perform a full fledged analysis of the system of cosmological perturbations in which the de and matter fluctuations are coupled in a dynamical way .",
    "this kind of analysis is presented here .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we outline the meaning of the cosmic coincidence problem within the general setting of the cosmological constant problem . in section [",
    "sect : perturbations ] , the basic equations for cosmological perturbations of a multicomponent fluid in the linear regime are introduced . in section [",
    "sect : effeos ] , we describe the general framework for addressing cosmological perturbations of a composite de fluid with an effective equation of state ( eos ) . in section [ sect : genericfeatures ] , we describe some generic features of the cosmological perturbations for the dark energy component . the particular setup of the @xmath3xcdm model is focused in section [ sect : lxcdm ] . in sections [ sect :",
    "perturblxcdm ] and [ numerical ] , we put the @xmath3xcdm model to the stringent test of cosmological perturbations and show that the corresponding region of parameter space becomes further reduced .",
    "most important , in this region the model is compatible with all known observational data and , therefore , the @xmath3xcdm proposal can be finally presented as a robust candidate model for solving the cosmic coincidence problem . in section [ defluct ] ,",
    "we offer a deeper insight into the correlation of matter and de perturbations . in the last section ,",
    "we present the final discussion and deliver our conclusions .",
    "the cosmic coincidence problem is a riddle , wrapped in the polyhedric mystery of the cosmological constant problem@xcite , which has many faces . indeed",
    ", we should clearly distinguish between the two main aspects which are hidden in the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem .",
    "in the first place , we have the `` old cc problem '' ( the ugliest face of the cc conundrum ! ) , i.e. the formidable task of trying to explain the relatively small ( for particle physics standards ) measured value of @xmath23 or , more generally , of the de density@xcite , roughly @xmath24 , after the many phase transitions that our universe has undergone since the very early times , in particular the electroweak higgs phase transition associated to the standard model of particle physics , whose natural value is in the ballpark of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being fermi s constant ) .",
    "the discrepancy @xmath27 , which amounts to some @xmath28 orders of magnitude , is the biggest enigma of fundamental physics ever !",
    "apart from the induced cc contribution from phase transitions , we have the pure vacuum - to - vacuum quantum effects .",
    "since the ( renormalized ) zero point energy of a free particle of mass @xmath29 contributes @xmath30 to the vacuum energy density@xcite , it turns out that even a free electron contributes an amount more than thirty orders of magnitude larger than the aforementioned experimental value of @xmath0 .",
    "only light neutrinos @xmath31 , or scalar particles of similar mass , could contribute just the right amount , namely if these particles would be the sole active degrees of freedom in our present cold universe ( see@xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the cosmic coincidence problem@xcite is that second ( `` minor '' ) aspect of the cc problem addressing the specific question : `` why just now ? '' , i.e. why do we find ourselves in an epoch @xmath32 where the de density is similar to the matter density , @xmath33 ? in view of the rapidly decreasing value of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the scale factor , it is quite puzzling to observe that its current value is precisely of the same order of magnitude as the vacuum energy or , in general , the dark energy density @xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to define the `` cosmic coincidence ratio '' @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the corresponding densities normalized with respect to the current critical density @xmath38 . for @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ", we have @xmath41 , which is of @xmath42 . however , in the standard cosmological @xmath3cdm model , where @xmath43 is constant and @xmath44 , the ratio @xmath45 grows unboundedly with the expansion of the universe . so the fact that @xmath46 is regarded as a puzzle because it suggests that @xmath32 is a very special epoch of our universe .",
    "one could also consider the inverse ratio @xmath47 , which goes to zero with the expansion .",
    "the coincidence problem can be equivalently formulated either by asking why @xmath45 is not very large now or why @xmath48 is not very small .",
    "solving the coincidence problem would be to find either 1 ) a concrete explanation for @xmath45 and @xmath48 being of order one at present within the standard cosmological model , or 2 ) a modified cosmological model ( compatible with all known cosmological data ) insuring that these ratios do not undergo a substantial change , say by more than one order of magnitude or so , for a very long period of the cosmic history that includes our time .    in a very simplified way ,",
    "let us summarize some of the possible avenues that have been entertained to cope with the coincidence puzzle :    * quintessence and the like @xcite .",
    "one postulates the existence of a set of cosmological scalar fields @xmath49 essentially unrelated to the rest of the particle physics world .",
    "the de produced by these fields has an effective eos parameter @xmath50 which causes @xmath0 to decrease always with the expansion ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , but at a pace slower ( on average ) than that of the background matter .",
    "thus , it finally catches up with it and @xmath0 emerges to surface , i.e. the condition @xmath52 eventually holds ( presumably near our time ) . in this framework",
    ", there is the possibility of self - adjusting and tracker solutions@xcite , where the de keeps track of the matter behavior and ultimately dominates the universe .",
    "it requires to take some special forms of the potential , and in some cases the lagrangian involves non - canonical kinetic terms .",
    "for example , in the simple case of a single scalar field and the exponential potential @xmath53 one finds that the coincidence ratio becomes fixed at the value @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the eos of the background matter ( i.e. @xmath56 or @xmath57 , depending on whether cold or relativistic matter dominates , respectively ) .",
    "so , at the present time , @xmath58 , and by appropriate choice of @xmath59 one can match the current experimental value .",
    "but of course the choice of the potential was rather peculiar and the field @xmath60 itself is completely _",
    "ad hoc_. moreover , it has a mass @xmath61 ( as it follows from a self - consistent solution of einstein s equations ) ; such mass scale is @xmath62 orders of magnitude below the mass scale associated to the de , which is @xmath63 . in this sense",
    ", it looks a bit unnatural to aim at solving the cc problem by introducing a field whose extremely tiny mass creates another cosmological puzzle . + on the other hand , within the context of interactive quintessence models@xcite ( whose main leitmotif is precisely trying to cure the coincidence problem ) , the coupling of @xmath64 and the matter components makes allowance for energy exchange between the two kinds of fields , and as a result the ratio ( [ ra ] ) can be constant or slowly variable , whereas in other implementations one can achieve an oscillatory tracking behavior of @xmath45 , although the construction is essentially _ _ ad hoc__@xcite .",
    "another generalization leads to k - essence models@xcite ( characterized by non - canonical kinetic terms ) , where fine tuning problems in the tracking can be disposed of but the dominant background component can be tracked only up to matter - radiation equality and is lost immediately afterwards ( as the de is immediately prompted into a cc - like behavior ) . in one way or another",
    ", however , all variants of quintessence suffer from several drawbacks , and in particular from the following generic one : they assume ( somehow implicitly ) that the remaining fields of the particle physics spectrum ( i.e. those which were already there from the very beginning ) have nothing to do with the cc problem . as a result of such a bold assumption ,",
    "the ( likely real ) vacuum problem of the conventional fields in qft is merely traded for the ( likely fictitious ) vacuum problem of quintessence , which is no less acute because no real explanation is provided for the smallness of the current @xmath0 value versus @xmath65 ( where @xmath29 is any typical mass scale in particle physics ) .",
    "hence we are back to the same kind of cc problem we started with . * phantom energy@xcite .",
    "it is motivated by the fact that , observationally speaking , the effective eos of the de can not be excluded to satisfy @xmath66 near our present time . as indicated above ,",
    "many quintessence - like models in reality are hybrid constructions containing a mixture of fields with a phantom component .",
    "the reason is that one wants to give allowance for a `` cc - crossing '' @xmath67 near our time . while phantom energy shares with quintessence the use of scalar fields @xmath64 , here the de produced by these fields is always _ increasing _ with the expansion , @xmath68 , even after the relation @xmath52 is fulfilled .",
    "the consequence of this ever growing behavior of the dark component is that one ends up with a superaccelerated expansion of the universe that triggers an eventual disruption of all forms of matter ( the so - called `` big rip '' ) .",
    "when computing the fraction of the lifetime of the universe where the ratio ( [ ra ] ) stays within given bounds before the `` doomsday '' , one finds that it can be sizeable .",
    "* non - local theories .",
    "there is some renewed interest in this kind of theories in which the emphasis is placed on the existence of possible non - local structures in the effective action @xcite .",
    "it has recently been emphasized in @xcite that the dynamical evolution of the vacuum energy should come from a resummation of terms in the effective action leading to non - local contributions of the form @xmath69 , for some unknown function @xmath70 of dimension @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the massless green s function ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the canonical possibility would be @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a parameter with dimension of mass .",
    "this situation leads to an effective evolution of the cc of the form @xmath76 during the matter dominated epoch , whereas in the radiation era the effective cc would approximately be zero ( because @xmath77 for relativistic matter , see ( [ einsteineq2])-([traceemt ] ) below ) . as a result , the coincidence puzzle could somehow be understood from the fact that the cc may start to be preponderant at some point once the onset of the matter dominated epoch is left behind .",
    "* of course many other ideas have been explored .",
    "for instance , one may introduce special fluids with very peculiar eos , such as the chaplygin gas@xcite , which behaves as pressureless matter at early times ( @xmath78 ) and as vacuum energy at present ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "although there is some connection with braneworld cosmology , this proposal suffers from the same problem as quintessence in that it supersedes the vacuum state of traditional fields by the new vacuum of that peculiar fluid .",
    "finally , let us mention the anthropic models , which fall in a quite different category , in the sense that one does not look for a solution of the coincidence problem exclusively from first principles of qft or string theory , but rather through the interplay of the `` human factor ''",
    ". basically , one ties the value of the ratio ( [ ra ] ) to the time when the conditions arise for the development of intelligent life in the universe , in particular of cosmologists making observations of the cosmos .",
    "this variant has also a long story , but we shall refrain from entering the details , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in the remaining of the paper we concentrate on studying some general properties of the cosmological perturbations , both of matter and de , and the implications they may have on the coincidence problem within models characterized by having running vacuum energy and other de components . according to cosmological perturbation theory , all energy density components , including the dark energy , should fluctuate and contribute to the growth of the large - scale cosmological structures . in this section",
    ", we discuss the general framework of linear density perturbations in models composed of a multicomponent de fluid besides the canonical matter .    in the following we use the standard metric perturbation approach @xcite and consider simultaneous density and pressure perturbations [ dppert ] _",
    "n_n+_n , p_np_n+p_n , for all the components ( @xmath80 ) of the fluid , including matter and all possible contributions from the multicomponent de part . at the same time , we have metric and velocity perturbations for each component : g^b _ g_=g^b_+g _ , u_n^u_n^+u_n^ , [ mfpert ] where @xmath81 is the background metric .",
    "the 4-vector velocity @xmath82 in the comoving coordinates has the following components and perturbations @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the three - velocity of the @xmath85th component of the fluid in the chosen coordinate system . as a background space - time , we assume the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric with flat space section , hence @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the scale factor .    in order to derive the set of perturbed equations , let us first introduce einstein s equations : [ einsteineq ] r_-rg_=8 g t _ , where @xmath11 is the newton constant and @xmath88 is the total energy - momentum tensor of matter and dark energy .",
    "both the background and perturbed metric are assumed to satisfy these equations .",
    "the total energy - momentum tensor of the system is assumed to be the sum of the perfect fluid form for each component : @xmath89\\,.\\ ] ] the components of @xmath90 are the following : ^0_0&=&_n _ n _ t , + t^i_j&=&-_n p_n ^i_j - p_t^i_j , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the total energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "perturbations on the metric and on the energy - momentum tensor are uniquely defined for a given perturbed space - time , provided we make a gauge choice .",
    "the latter means that we choose a specific coordinate system ; in this way , four out of the @xmath7 components @xmath93 of the metric perturbation can be fixed at will .",
    "here we have adopted the synchronous gauge , widely used in the literature , in which the four preassigned values of the metric perturbations are @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "setting @xmath96 , in this gauge the perturbed , spatially flat , flrw metric takes on the form [ flrwsynch ] ds^2 & = & g_dx^dx^=dt^2 -a^2(t)(_ij+_ij)dx^idx^j + & = & a^2 ( ) , where in the last equality we have expressed the result also in terms of the conformal time @xmath97 , defined through @xmath98 .",
    "we may compare ( [ flrwsynch ] ) with the most general perturbation of the spatially flat flrw metric , [ flrwpert ] ds^2 & = & a^2()[(1 + 2)d^2-_iddx^i + & & - ( ( 1 - 2)_ij+_ij)dx^idx^j ] , consisting of the @xmath7 degrees of freedom associated to the two scalar functions @xmath99 , @xmath60 , the three components of the vector function @xmath100 , and the five components of the traceless @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , the synchronous gauge ( [ flrwsynch ] ) is obtained by setting @xmath102 , @xmath103 and absorbing the function @xmath60 into the trace of @xmath101 . in this way , @xmath101 in ( [ flrwsynch ] ) contributes six degrees of freedom . as we will see in a moment , in practice only the nonvanishing trace of the metric disturbance will be necessary to perform the analysis of cosmic perturbations in this gauge .",
    "to within first order of perturbation theory , such a trace is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the inverse of @xmath106 , and it is understood that the repeated latin indices are summed over @xmath107 .    for the physical interpretation ,",
    "notice that the synchronous gauge is associated to a coordinate system in which the cosmic time coordinate is comoving with the fluid particles ( @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath102 ) , which is the reason for its name and also explains why this gauge does not have an obvious newtonian limit .",
    "in fact , this gauge choice is generally appropriate for the study of fluctuations whose wavelength is larger than the hubble radius ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "actually , any mode satisfies this condition at sufficiently early epochs , and in this regime the effects of the space - time curvature are unavoidable .",
    "next we wish to compute the perturbations in the synchronous gauge . to start with ,",
    "it is convenient to rewrite einstein s equations ( [ einsteineq ] ) as follows , [ einsteineq2 ] r_=8 g s _ ,  _ _ -g_t , where @xmath110 is the trace of ( [ emt ] ) , hence [ traceemt ] t = _ n(_n-3p_n ) . for the calculation of the perturbations",
    ", we can use any of the components of einstein s equations .",
    "however , since we are going to use the conservation law @xmath111 to derive additional fluctuation equations , it is convenient to perturb the @xmath112-component of ( [ einsteineq2 ] ) because the other components are well - known not to be independent of the conservation law . thus , using ( [ emt ] ) , ( [ einsteineq2 ] ) and ( [ traceemt ] ) we obtain [ szz ] s_00 & = & t_00 - 12t=12_n(_n+3p_n ) + & & s_00=12_n(_n+3p_n ) . on the other hand",
    ", a straightforward calculation shows that the perturbation of the @xmath112-component of the ricci tensor can be written as follows : @xmath113 where we have used ( [ trace ] ) and defined the `` hat variable '' [ hdef ] ( ) = - .",
    "the overhead circle ( @xmath114 ) indicates partial differentiation with respect to the cosmic time ( i.e. @xmath115 , for any @xmath116 ) , in order to distinguish it from other differentiations to be used later on .",
    "therefore , @xmath117 is the ordinary expansion rate in the cosmic time @xmath118 .    since the fluctuations @xmath119 and @xmath120 from ( [ szz ] ) and ( [ drmn ] )",

    "however , at smaller scales , specially at scales inside the sound horizon , and for a general non - adiabatic regime , we need to solve the aforesaid complete system of equations for the basic set of perturbation variables for the metric , matter and de : @xmath258 in this way , we have extended the effective treatment of the de perturbations presented in ref.@xcite , and we are now ready to better assess the scope of its applicability . in section [",

    "one might think that the divergence can be absorbed through a redefinition of the variables , but this is not the case .    getting around this difficulty is not always possible .",
    "it is well - known that there is no way for a single scalar field model to cross the cc boundary@xcite .",
    "the simplest way to avoid this problem is to assume two fields @xmath265 , e.g. one that works as quintessence @xmath266 and dominates the de density until the cc - crossing point , and beyond it the other field retakes the evolution with a phantom behavior @xmath267 , or the other way around ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion and specific parameterizations of @xmath16 .",
    "as we will see , in the @xmath227xcdm model the additional restrictions needed to avoid this divergence will further constrain the physical region of the parameter space .",
    "another well - known problem is the unbounded growth of the de perturbations for a negative squared speed of sound @xmath197 . as already mentioned in the previous section , in the adiabatic case we have @xmath268 , which is in general negative as long as the eos parameter is not varying too fast . as a result",
    ", the adiabatic de perturbations may lead to explosive growth unless extra degrees of freedom are assumed ( see e.g. @xcite for discussion ) .    in order to better see the origin of the problem ,",

    "this feature is treated in more depth in the following section .      as a matter of fact , eq.([2ndorder ] )",
    "is an oversimplification .",

    "therefore , according to the previous discussions , we expect the de density to be smooth at those scales , and indeed it will be so for the @xmath3xcdm model .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see in section [ defluct ] , the larger the scale @xmath296 or the smaller the speed of sound @xmath281 , the more important the de perturbations are , because then ( [ shcond ] ) is not such a good approximation .",

    "the rg method in cosmology treats the vacuum energy density as a running parameter and aims at finding a fundamental differential relation ( renormalization group equation ) of the form @xmath329 which is supposed to describe the leading quantum contributions to it , where @xmath330 is a function of the parameters @xmath331 of the effective action ( ea ) and @xmath332 is a dimensional scale .",
    "the appearance of this arbitrary mass scale is characteristic of the renormalization procedure in qft owing to the intrinsic breaking of scale invariance by quantum effects .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 in ( [ rgcc ] ) is a ( @xmath332-dependent ) renormalized part of the complete qft structure of the vacuum energy .",
    "depending on the renormalization scheme , the scale @xmath332 can have a more or less transparent physical meaning , but the physics should be completely independent of it .",
    "such ( overall ) @xmath332-independence of the observable quantities is actually the main message of the rg ; but , remarkably enough , the @xmath332-dependence of the individual parts is also the clue of the rg technique to uncover the leading quantum effects .",
    "essential for the rg method in cosmology is to understand that , in order for the vacuum energy to acquire dynamical properties , we need a nontrivial external metric background .",
    "the dynamical properties of this curved background ( e.g. the expanding flrw space - time , characterized by the expansion rate @xmath333 ) are expected to induce a functional dependence @xmath334 .",
    "the latter should follow from parameterizing the quantum effects with the help of the scale @xmath332 and then using some appropriate correspondence of @xmath332 with a physical quantity , typically with @xmath333 in the cosmological context , although there are other possibilities@xcite . in this way",
    ", one expects to estimate the subset of quantum effects reflecting the dynamical properties of the non - trivial background .",
    "although @xmath332 cancels in the full ea , the rg method enables one to separate the relevant class of quantum effects responsible for the running .",
    "the procedure is similar to the rg in a scattering process in qcd ; the parametrization of the quantum effects in terms of @xmath332 is the crucial strategy to finally link them with the energy of the process through the correspondence @xmath335 ( where @xmath336 is a typical momentum of the scattering process ) at high energy .",
    "one can also proceed in the same way in qed and electroweak theory ( although here one can adopt more physical subtraction schemes , if desired ) .",
    "the rg technique can actually be extended to the whole particle physics domain . in cosmology , however , the situation is more complicated , partly because ( as remarked above ) the physical scale behind the quantum effects is not obvious .",
    "still , one expects that it should be related with the expanding metric background and hence the expansion rate @xmath333 can be regarded as a reasonable possibility . on this basis ,",
    "the heuristic arguments exhibited in @xcite combined with the general covariance of the ea suggest that the solution of the rg equation ( [ rgcc ] ) should lead to the kind of quadratic law ( [ runlamb ] ) that we have used .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the point of view of ref.@xcite is incorrect on two main accounts : first , because they try to disprove the running through the overall cancelation of the arbitrary scale @xmath332 in the ea ; and second , because they neglect the essential role played by the non - trivial metric background .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the cancelation of @xmath332 in the ea can not be argued as a valid criticism because this fact is a built - in feature of the rg and it was never questioned .",
    "if this would be a real criticism , it would also apply to qed , qcd or any other renormalizable qft , and nevertheless this is no obstacle for using the rg method in these theories as an extremely useful strategy to extract the dependence of the quantum effects on the physical energy scale of the processes , in particular the so - called running coupling constants @xmath337 and @xmath338 of the strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "moreover , in the absence of a non - trivial metric background , there is no physical running of the vacuum energy , even though there is still @xmath332-dependence of the various parts of the ea and in particular of the cc , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the end of the day such criticism seems to go against the essence of the rg method and its recognized ability to encapsulate the leading quantum effects on the physical observables .    in cosmology",
    ", the principles of the rg should be the same , but there are two main stumbling blocks that prevent from straightforwardly extending the method in practice@xcite , to wit : i ) the aforesaid lack of an obvious / unique correspondence of @xmath332 with a cosmological scale defining the physical running , and also ( no less important ) ii ) the huge technical problems related with the application of the rg within a physical ( momentum - dependent ) renormalization scheme in a curved background .",
    "these difficulties are unavoidable here because we are dealing with qft in the infrared regime and moreover the metric expansions can not be performed on a flat background ; indeed , there can not be a flat background in the presence of a cosmological term ! while these two problems remain unresolved in a completely satisfactory manner , it is legitimate to use the phenomenological approach and the educated guess ( e.g. the general covariance of the ea ) to hint at the running law .",
    "this is the guiding principle followed in the aforementioned references and that led to eq.([runlamb ] ) .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that irrespective of whether such law can be substantiated within the strict framework of the rg , the present study remains perfectly useful simply treating ( [ runlamb ] ) as an acceptable type of a phenomenological variation law and keeping also in mind that adding the cosmon may contribute to the resolution of the pressing cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "in this section , we further elaborate on the conditions to bound the ratio @xmath339 and discuss the constraints on the parameter space , in particular the impact of the de perturbations on these constraints . in section [",
    "sect : genericfeatures ] , we discussed analytically some generic features about de perturbations . in principle",
    ", those results should apply to any model in which the de is self - conserved .",
    "the @xmath3xcdm model , given its peculiarities ( a composite de which results in a complicated evolution of the effective eos ) , constitutes a non - trivial example of that kind of models . in this sense",
    ", it is interesting to use the @xmath3xcdm to put our general predictions to the test . at the same time",
    ", this will allow us to impose new constraints on the parameter space of the model , improving its predictivity .",
    "the parameter space of the @xmath3xcdm model was already tightly constrained in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the matter density fluctuations were analyzed under the assumption that the de perturbations could be neglected .",
    "as a first approximation this is reasonable since , as we have discussed in section [ sect : genericfeatures ] , the de is expected to be smooth at scales well below the sound horizon .",
    "thus , we will take the results of @xcite as our starting point and will check numerically the goodness of that approximation .",
    "finally , we will further constrain the parameter space using the full approach presented in the present work .",
    "let us summarize the constraints that were imposed in @xcite :    1 .",
    "nucleosynthesis bounds : as already commented , the ratio ( [ ratiolxcdm ] ) between de and matter densities should remain relatively small at the nucleosynthesis time , in order not to spoil the big bang model predictions on light - element abundances . requiring that ratio to be less than @xmath19",
    ", it roughly translates into the condition @xmath340 , where the parameter @xmath316 was defined in eq.([epsilon ] ) .",
    "solution of the coincidence problem : in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath3xcdm model was originally introduced as a possible solution to the coincidence problem , it was shown that there is a large sub - volume of the total @xmath3xcdm parameter space for which the ratio @xmath222 remains bounded and near the current value @xmath341 ( say , @xmath342 , where @xmath343 ) during a large fraction of the history of the universe .",
    "thus , the fact that the matter and de densities are comparable right now may no longer be seen as a coincidence . such solution of the coincidence problem is related to the existence of a future stopping ( and subsequent reversal ) of the universe expansion within the relevant region of the parameter space .",
    "current value of the eos parameter : recent studies ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that the value of the de effective eos should not be very far from @xmath344 at present .",
    "although these results usually rely on the assumption of a constant eos parameter ( and thus are not directly applicable to the @xmath3xcdm model ) , we adopted a conservative point of view and stuck to them by enforcing the condition @xmath345 on the eos function ( [ welcdm ] ) .",
    "4 .   consistency with lss data : as said before , in @xcite we studied the growth of matter density fluctuations under the assumption that the de was smooth on the scales relevant to the linear part of the matter power spectrum . from the fact that the standard @xmath3cdm model provides a good fit to the observational data , we took it as a reference and imposed that the amount of growth ( specifically , the matter power spectrum ) , of our model did not deviate by more than @xmath19 from the @xmath3cdm value ( `` f - test '' condition ) .",
    "this condition can be also be justified from the observed galaxy fluctuation power spectrum , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the upshot of that analysis was that there is still a big sub - volume of the three dimensional @xmath3xcdm parameter space @xmath346 satisfying simultaneously the above conditions .",
    "this means that @xmath347 for a spatially flat universe . for better comparison with those results",
    ", we keep this prior also in the present work . ] .",
    "the projections of that volume onto the three perpendicular planes @xmath348 , @xmath349 and @xmath350 are displayed in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ( shaded regions ) .",
    "these regions where already determined in ref.@xcite . in the next section , we will discuss how the final set of allowed points becomes further reduced when we take into account the analysis of the de perturbations .",
    "as discussed in section [ sect : genericfeatures ] , if the effective eos of the model crosses the cc boundary ( @xmath261 ) at some point in the past , the perturbation equations will present a real divergence .",
    "obviously , this circumstance makes the numerical analysis unfeasible at the points of parameter space affected by the singularity .    in the absence of an apparent mechanism to get around this singularity , we are forced to restrict our parameter space to the subregion where the solution of the perturbation equations ( [ hpert])-([perteeqde ] ) is regular , namely by removing those points of the parameter space that present such a crossing in the past , because these points can not belong to a well defined history of the universe . in the absence of a more detailed definition of the cosmon entity @xmath12",
    ", this new constraint is unavoidable .",
    "this should not be considered as a drawback of the model , for even in the case when one uses a collection of elementary scalar fields to represent the de , one generally meets the same kind of divergent behavior as soon as the cc boundary is crossed , unless some special conditions are arranged . in other words , even if the components of the de are as simple as , say , elementary scalar fields with smooth behavior and well - defined dynamical properties ( including an appropriately chosen potential ) , there is no a priori guarantee that the cc boundary can be crossed safely@xcite .",
    "it is possible to concoct ingenious recipes , see e.g. @xcite , such that the perturbation equations become regular at the cc boundary , but the procedure is artificial in that one must introduce new fields ( one quintessence - like and another phantom - like ) satisfying special properties such that their respective eos behaviors match up continuously at the cc - crossing .",
    "apart from the fact that fields with negative kinetic terms are not very welcome in qft , one can not just replace the original fields with the new ones without at the same time changing the original de model ! as we will see below , in the @xmath3xcdm case the absence of cc - crossing projects out a region of the parameter space which is significantly more reduced , and therefore the predictive power of the model becomes substantially enhanced .    in section 6 of the first reference in@xcite",
    ", it was shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for having a cc boundary crossing in the past within the @xmath3xcdm model is that the parameter @xmath351 given in ( [ b ] ) is positive . as can be readily seen",
    ", this will happen whenever @xmath300 and @xmath352 have the same sign ( where we use the fact that @xmath353 and @xmath354 in the relevant region of parameter space ) . from the cosmic sum rule of the @xmath3xcdm model",
    ", we have @xmath355 ; thus , using our prior @xmath356 , the set of allowed points ( for which @xmath357 has _ different _ sign from @xmath300 ) are those comprised in the striped areas in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "this leaves us with a very small allowed region in each plane , which is just the corresponding intersection of the shaded area and the striped one .    at the end of the day",
    ", it turns out that most of the points in the shaded area in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ( viz .",
    "those allowed by the conditions stated in the previous section and the analysis of @xcite ) are ruled out by the new constraint emerging from the de perturbations analysis , and hence we end up with a rather definite prediction for the values of the @xmath3xcdm parameters . in particular , we find from these figures that only small positive values of @xmath300 are allowed , at most of order @xmath358 .",
    "let us emphasize that this is in very good agreement with the theoretical expectations mentioned in section [ sect : lxcdm ] .",
    "recall that , from the point of view of the physical interpretation of @xmath300 in eq.([nu ] ) , we expected @xmath300 in the ballpark of @xmath359 at most ",
    "see eq.([nu0 ] )  since the masses of the particles contributing to the running of the cc should naturally lie below the planck scale determined in ref.@xcite are possible only because , in the latter work , the de is not conserved and there is no cosmon . as we have shown in @xcite , a running cosmological constant model without a self - conserved de can not solve the coincidence problem in a natural way because the required values of @xmath300 are too large and , hence , incompatible with the physical interpretation of this parameter . ] .",
    "let us mention that the interesting bounds on @xmath300 obtained in ref.@xcite on the basis of the so - called generalized second law of gravitational thermodynamics would suggest that only the effective mass near the planck mass is allowed . however , let us point out that such study has been performed without including the non - trivial effect from the cosmon .",
    "+    a very important consequence of the dark energy perturbative constraint is that the effective eos of the de can be quintessence - like only , i.e. @xmath259 . to prove this statement ,",
    "let us start from eq.([dewx ] ) .",
    "for the current values of the parameters , this equation can be rewritten as @xmath360 where @xmath361 is the value of the effective eos parameter at the present time .",
    "looking at figs.[fig2]a and [ fig2]b , we realize the following two relevant features : first , the cosmon component is necessarily phantom - like ( @xmath362 ) in the allowed region by the de perturbations ; and , second , its energy density at present is negative ; namely , @xmath363 because from fig.[fig2]b we have @xmath364 .",
    "therefore , since the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of ( [ aux ] ) is constrained to be positive and @xmath365 , we are enforced to have @xmath366 .",
    "however , the fulfilment of this condition at present implies its accomplishment in the past , i.e. @xmath367 , otherwise there would have been a crossing of the cc boundary at some earlier time , which is excluded by the analysis of the de perturbations .",
    "the upshot is that the eos of the de in the @xmath3xcdm model can only appear effectively as quintessence ( _ q.e.d _ ) . in reality",
    ", it only mimics quintessence , of course , as its ultimate nature is _ not _ ; such de medium is a mixture made out of running vacuum energy and a compensating entity that insures full energy conservation of the compound system .",
    "dark energy components @xmath12 with negative energy density are peculiar in cosmology since , in contrast to standard de components , they satisfy the strong energy condition ( like ordinary matter ) , and as a result the gravitational behavior of @xmath12 is attractive rather than repulsive . due to this double resemblance with matter and phantom de",
    "( although with the distinctive feature @xmath368 ) , such components can be called `` phantom matter '' @xcite . being @xmath12 in general an effective entity , such `` phantom matter '' behavior is actually non - fundamental .      in the equations ( [ hpert])-([perteeqde ] ) , we assumed the most general case in which the perturbations could be non - adiabatic .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the adiabatic case usually leads to an unphysical exponential growth of the perturbations as a result of @xmath262 in ( [ adspeedde ] ) being negative .",
    "next we will check that , indeed , the most common situation in the @xmath3xcdm model is to have @xmath369 .",
    "notwithstanding , adiabatic perturbations are not completely forbidden in the present framework , as there is a small region of the parameter space for which @xmath262 could be positive .    from eqs.([adspeedde ] ) and ( [ dewx ] ) , and making use of the de conservation law ( [ decons ] ) , we find that the adiabatic speed of sound for the @xmath3xcdm model can be cast as follows , @xmath370 with the help of ( [ rhox ] ) , we can rewrite the last expression as @xmath371 we want to find out the condition for this expression to be positive . as @xmath372 ( remember that @xmath353 and @xmath340 , due to nucleosynthesis constraints ) , that condition simply reads @xmath373 the cosmon energy density @xmath322 can not vanish because , in such case , the perturbation equations would diverge .",
    "indeed , @xmath374 corresponds to a cc - boundary crossing at some value of the scale factor in the past , cf .",
    "eq.([welcdm ] ) . thus",
    ", being @xmath322 a continuous function , it must have the same sign in the past as that of its present value , i.e. @xmath375 .",
    "in short , the final condition that ensures that @xmath376 is @xmath377 if this condition would be satisfied , then @xmath376 would hold for the entire past history of the universe and , under these circumstances , the adiabatic equations may be used .",
    "it turns out that the relation ( [ cond ] ) can be satisfied in the @xmath3xcdm model , although only in a narrow range of the parameter space . in fact , from the definition of the parameter @xmath351 in ( [ b ] ) , the expectation that @xmath378 , and neglecting @xmath316 , we see that ( [ cond ] ) is approximately equivalent to @xmath379 given the fact that @xmath300 was found to be positive and small ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig1]-[fig2 ] ) and , at the same time , @xmath380 ( see previous section ) , the above condition does not leave much freedom within the allowed parameter space , roughly @xmath381 .",
    "this narrow strip is , however , not necessarily negligible ; e.g. if we take @xmath300 of order of @xmath359 ( cf .",
    "eq.([nu0 ] ) ) , this possibility is still permitted in the parameter space , see figs.[fig1]-[fig2 ] .",
    "in such case , the present cosmon density could still be of the order or larger ( in absolute value ) than , say , the current neutrino contribution to the energy density of the universe ( @xmath382 ) .",
    "no matter how tiny is ( in absolute value ) a negative cosmon contribution to the energy density , it suffices to take care of the cosmic coincidence problem along the lines that we have explained .",
    "therefore , the adiabatic contribution is perfectly tenable , but the numerical analysis of the subsequent sections remains essentially the same ( as we have checked ) independently of whether the sound speed of the de medium is adiabatic or not .",
    "for this reason , in what follows we will assume the more general situation of non - adiabatic perturbations , with the understanding that adiabatic ones can do a similar job in the corresponding region of the parameter space .",
    "in this section , we compare the matter power spectrum predicted by the @xmath3xcdm model with the observed galaxy power spectrum measured by the 2dfgrs survey @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3xcdm matter power spectrum is found by evolving the perturbation equations ( [ hpert])-([perteeqde ] ) from @xmath383 to the present ( @xmath292 ) , where @xmath384 is the scale factor at some early time , but well after recombination . in these equations ,",
    "we must of course use the expansion rate ( [ hlxcdm ] ) with the full de density ( [ normde ] ) .    in order to set the initial conditions at @xmath383",

    "indeed , the standard @xmath3cdm model provides a good analytical fit to the 2dfgrs observed galaxy power spectrum . taking this fit as our starting point , we compute analytically the values of the @xmath3cdm perturbations at an arbitrary scale factor . since the de does not play an important role until very recently",
    ", we may assume that the initial matter and metric perturbations at @xmath383 for the @xmath3xcdm model are the same as for the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "as previously commented , the perturbed equations are evolved from some @xmath384 to @xmath292 .",
    "the value of @xmath385 is unimportant , provided that it lies well after recombination ( to insure that all the processes encoded in the transfer function have already taken place ) . for definiteness , we take @xmath386 , i.e. cosmological redshift @xmath387 .",
    "next we specify the initial conditions at @xmath383 .",
    "for the matter and metric perturbations , the initial conditions in the standard cosmological model can be computed analytically@xcite .",

    "the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of the differential equation ( [ ggrowth3 ] ) vanishes and we are left with an homogeneous equation . in the standard model ,",
    "this equation is just eq.([ggrowth3ex ] ) with @xmath261 , i.e. @xmath389 since matter is conserved , we have @xmath390 .",
    "moreover , from eq.([hdot2 ] ) ( again with @xmath261 ) one can also see that @xmath391 .",
    "hence , the homogeneous equation ( [ ggrowthsm ] ) can be conveniently cast as follows : @xmath392 this equation is now in a standard form and can be solved analytically@xcite .",
    "let us first introduce the variable @xmath393 ( the so - called growth factor ) , where @xmath394 is the matter density contrast at some initial scale factor .",
    "in the initial matter era ( @xmath395 ) wherein the cosmological term is negligible , we have @xmath396 in very good approximation ; then , by imposing the boundary conditions @xmath397 and @xmath398 , the growing solution of ( [ homog ] ) is simply @xmath399 , as can be easily checked . in the general case , one can find the solution for the growing mode which reduces to the previous one deep into the matter dominated era .",
    "the final result reads @xmath400 in particular , for @xmath401 it just boils down to the solution @xmath399 corresponding to the early matter dominated epoch , as expected .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ hpert ] ) leads to @xmath402 and for @xmath399 it renders the initial condition @xmath403 for the metric fluctuation .",
    "later on , when the de ( i.e. @xmath404 in the @xmath3cdm ) starts to play a role , the matter ( and metric ) fluctuations become suppressed .",
    "the suppression is given by the value of the growth factor @xmath405 , which is no longer proportional to the scale factor is small and essentially constant , then the growth factor @xmath405 takes the approximate form @xmath406 , with @xmath407 , as it follows from ( [ deltaod ] ) for @xmath261 , or from ( [ ggrowthsm ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates , if only roughly , the suppression behavior in an explicit analytic way . in the general @xmath3cdm case , however , the solution for the growing mode is given by ( [ da ] ) , in which @xmath333 is the full expansion rate of the standard model . ] . from ( [ da ] )",
    "it is clear that @xmath408 is a constant , which can be written as @xmath409 at early times ( when @xmath410 ) and as @xmath411 at the present time .",
    "therefore , @xmath412 where @xmath413 and the subindex in @xmath414 has been added to emphasize that the initial value of the hubble parameter is to be computed within the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "note that , instead of setting the value of @xmath415 , we could have chosen to put initial conditions on the derivative of the density contrast , @xmath416 .",
    "in that case , as it is evident from ( [ inic1 ] ) , we would have that @xmath417 .",
    "then the initial value of the metric fluctuation is constrained by eq .",

    "this primordial spectrum is modified when taking into account the physical properties of different constituents of the universe , in particular the interactions between them .",

    "for instance , in @xcite it is proposed an alternative normalization for the @xmath3cdm model , which for @xmath449 and @xmath450 yields @xmath451 , with an error of the order of @xmath452 , which is in agreement with our result . in general one can find a number of different values for @xmath430 in the literature depending on the kind of analysis performed or the data set used , and this is why we preferred to compute the normalization directly from a fit to the matter power spectrum .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that our value for @xmath430 lies within the @xmath453 confidence interval for the observed quadrupole anisotropy ( @xmath445 ) by both cobe @xcite and wmap @xcite .",

    "the procedure discussed above helps us to set initial conditions for the matter and metric perturbations in the @xmath455cdm model .",

    "in particular , we can ( as a consistency check ) solve the perturbation equations for the @xmath3cdm model ( in that case @xmath388 , so the only equations needed are ( [ hpert ] ) and ( [ perteeqde ] ) ) .",
    "in doing so , we recover exactly the spectrum @xmath463 defined in ( [ powers ] ) .",
    "now we proceed to compute the spectrum of the @xmath3xcdm , @xmath464 . in order to better compare the shape of the different spectra and the goodness of their fit to the 2dfgrs observed galaxy power spectrum , we will normalize them at the smallest length scale considered @xmath154 ,",
    "i.e. at @xmath465 , taking the @xmath3cdm spectrum ( [ powers ] ) as reference .",
    "to this purpose , we introduce a normalization factor @xmath466 in the matter power spectrum :    @xmath467    notice that the normalization factor @xmath466 gives us the difference in the matter power spectrum of the model with respect to that of the @xmath3cdm at the specific scale @xmath465 .",
    "let us clarify that the reason for choosing this scale for the normalization is that , as discussed in section [ sect : genericfeatures ] , the smaller the length scale ( i.e. the higher the value of @xmath148 ) the less important the de perturbations are .",
    "therefore , at @xmath465 , the matter power spectrum of the model should not depend significantly on whether we consider the effect of the de perturbations ; in particular , it should be independent of the speed of sound @xmath281 .",
    "for larger scales , however , the de perturbations can be more significant and , as we shall see below , they may introduce some differences in the shape of the power spectrum , which are nevertheless small in the linear regime .",

    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] . for these values , we have obtained a normalization factor @xmath476 and an accurate agreement between the @xmath477 power spectrum and @xmath478 .",

    "therefore , the predicted power spectrum from the @xmath3xcdm ought to be very close to the @xmath479 one , which is in fact what we have substantiated now by explicit numerical check .    however , for values of the parameters out of the allowed region in fig .",

    "let us remind that the f - test consists in requiring that the matter power spectrum of the model under consideration ( in this case , the @xmath3xcdm model ) differs from that of the @xmath3cdm in less that a 10% , under the assumption that de perturbations can be neglected .",
    "given the fact ( explicitly analyzed here ) that the de perturbations should not play a very important role , it is reasonable to expect that the f - test should be approximately valid even when we do not neglect the de perturbations .",

    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "this suggests that , under such circumstances , the de density perturbations are not completely negligible owing to the fact that the term which depends on @xmath148 in the perturbation equations is also proportional to @xmath271  see eq.([deperttheta ] ) .",
    "in addition , there appears a suppression of the growth of matter fluctuations in comparison with the growth predicted by the @xmath297cdm model .",
    "this inhibition of matter growth is characteristic of cosmologies where the de behaves quintessence - like , i.e. when the de density decreases with the expansion , whereas phantom - like de ( increasing with the expansion ) would cause the opposite effect ( an enhancement of the power ) .",
    "a similar situation was also observed in ref.@xcite for models with pure running @xmath3 , where in the case @xmath492 ( in which @xmath3 decreases with the expansion ) there is an inhibition of growth while for @xmath493 ( when @xmath3 increases with the expansion ) there is an enhancement  see also @xcite and @xcite for other studies .",

    "on the other hand , values of the parameters not satisfying the f - test present not only suppression on the growth of matter density fluctuations , as shown in fig .",

    "the gray lines represent the evolution of @xmath254 when the last term in eq.([depert ] ) is neglected , showing indeed that the qualitative behavior of the perturbations in the adiabatic and @xmath502 cases does not stem from that term .    for @xmath502 ,",
    "the scale considered is initially ( i.e. at @xmath386 ) larger than the sound horizon , and thus the term proportional to @xmath499 is negligible at the beginning of the evolution .",
    "the same is true for the adiabatic case because , in the asymptotic past , the effective eos of the @xmath3xcdm model resembles that of matter - radiation ( @xmath503 for @xmath504)@xcite and , thus , we have @xmath505 in the matter dominated epoch .",
    "( we recall that in all our discussion we remain in the matter epoch , equality being at @xmath506 ) .",
    "therefore , the term proportional to @xmath499 is initially unimportant in all the three cases and this makes the perturbations to evolve in a nearly identical fashion at these first stages , as it can be clearly seen from fig .",

    "[ fig9]b , we plot the ratio between these two terms for both the adiabatic case ( with @xmath500 ) and the non - adiabatic situation ( @xmath502 ) ( note that the term proportional to @xmath508 may be neglected for the sub - hubble perturbations we are dealing with ) .",

    "[ fig9]a reveals that it is precisely when the term proportional to @xmath187 stops being negligible that the evolution of the perturbations begins to depart from the @xmath501 case .",
    "the absolute value of the adiabatic speed of sound is also shown , in order to illustrate the ultimate reason for the start - up of the exponential growth in the adiabatic mode : it is only when @xmath262 begins to depart significantly from 0 that the term proportional to @xmath499 becomes important , which in turn triggers a rocket increase of the velocity gradient @xmath187 .    as we have discussed in connection to fig .",
    "[ fig9]a , the initial evolution of the perturbations in the @xmath3xcdm model is nearly the same for any of the three values of the speed of sound .",
    "in fact , in the adiabatic case , and given the behavior of the effective eos in the asymptotic past , the conditions that lead to the simplified setup ( [ depert2 ] ) hold . therefore , that is the equation initially controlling the evolution of @xmath254 .",
    "for @xmath501 we arrive at exactly the same equation , whereas for positive @xmath197 the resulting equation only differs by the last term in ( [ depert ] ) , which , as it has been previously discussed , happens to be negligible at least during the first stages of the evolution .",

    "we conclude that the approximation of neglecting the de perturbations can be justified@xcite . but this does not mean that the computation of these perturbations is useless . indeed , the issue at stake here is not so much the quantitative impact of the de fluctuations upon the matter power spectrum  which is actually negligible , as we have seen  but rather the fact that the de perturbations may be consistently defined in a certain subregion of the parameter space only .",
    "of course this subregion can not be detected within the context of the effective approach @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general , the computation of the de perturbations may have a final quantitative bearing on this kind of analyses since it may further restrict the physical region of the parameter space in a very significant way .",
    "in short , even though the simultaneous account of the de perturbations has a small numerical effect on the matter power spectrum within the domain where the full system of cosmological perturbations is well - defined , it may nevertheless prove to be a highly efficient method for excluding large regions of parameter space where that system is ill - defined .",
    "the upshot is that the combined analysis of the de and matter perturbations may significantly enhance the predictivity of the model , as we have indeed illustrated in detail for the non - trivial case of the @xmath3xcdm model of the cosmic evolution .",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the impact of the cosmological perturbations on the coincidence problem .",
    "in contrast to the previous study@xcite , where this problem was examined in a simplified `` effective approach '' in which the dark energy ( de ) perturbations were neglected , in the present work we have taken them into account in a full - fledged manner .",
    "we find that the results of the previous analysis were reasonable because the de perturbations generally tend to smooth at scales below the sound horizon .",
    "however , the inclusion of the de perturbations proved extremely useful to pin down the physical region of the parameter space and also to put the effective approach within a much larger perspective and to set its limitations .",
    "first of all , we have performed a thorough discussion on the coupled set of matter and de perturbations for a general multicomponent fluid .",
    "this has prepared the ground to treat models in which the de is a composite medium with a variable equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we have concentrated on those cases in which the de , despite its composite nature , is described by a self - conserved density @xmath0 .",
    "notice that if matter is covariantly conserved , the covariant conservation of the de is mandatory .",
    "in particular , this is the situation for the standard @xmath3cdm model , although in this case the self - conservation of the de appears through a trivial cosmological constant term , @xmath518 , which remains imperturbable throughout the entire history of the universe .",
    "one may nevertheless entertain generalized frameworks where the de is not only self - conserved , but is non - trivial and dynamical .",
    "this is not a mere academic exercise ; for instance , in quantum field theory in curved space - time we generally expect that the vacuum energy should be a running quantity@xcite .",
    "therefore , in such cases , the cc density becomes an effective parameter that may evolve typically with the expansion rate , @xmath334 , and constitutes a part of the full ( dynamical ) de of the composite cosmological system with variable eos . in these circumstances , if the gravitational coupling @xmath11 is constant , the running cc density @xmath334 can not be covariantly conserved unless other terms in the effective action of this system compensate for the cc variation .",
    "we have called the effective entity that produces such compensation `` @xmath12 '' or `` cosmon '' , and denoted with @xmath314 its energy density . therefore , @xmath14 is the self - conserved total de density in this context , which must be dealt with together with the ordinary density of matter @xmath1 .",
    "a generic model of this kind is what we have called the @xmath3xcdm model@xcite .",
    "furthermore , from general considerations based on the covariance of the effective action of qft in curved space - time@xcite , we expect that the running cc density @xmath334 should be an affine quadratic law of the expansion rate @xmath333 , see eq.([runlamb ] ) .",
    "using this guiding principle and the ansatz of self - conservation of the de , we find that the evolution of @xmath314 , and hence of @xmath0 , becomes completely determined , even though its ultimate nature remains unknown . in particular , @xmath12 is _ not _ a scalar field in general .",
    "the @xmath3xcdm model was first studied in @xcite as a promising solution to the cosmic coincidence problem , in the sense that the coincidence ratio @xmath6 can stay relatively constant , meaning that it does not vary in more than one order of magnitude for many hubble times .",
    "the main aim of the present paper was to make a further step to consolidate such possible solution of the coincidence problem , specifically from the analysis of the coupled system of matter and de perturbations .",
    "let us remark that this has been a rather non - trivial test for the @xmath3xcdm model .",
    "indeed , after intersecting the region where the de perturbations of this model can be consistently defined , with the region where the coincidence problem can be solved@xcite , we end up with a significantly more reduced domain of parameter space where the model can exist in full compatibility with all known cosmological data .",
    "the main conclusion of this study is that the predictivity of the model has substantially increased .",
    "therefore , it can be better put to the test in the next generation of precision cosmological observations , which include the promising des , snap and planck projects@xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , we have found that the final region of the parameter space is a naturalness region which is more accessible to the aforementioned precision experiments .",
    "for example , we have obtained the bound @xmath519 for the parameter that determines the running of the cosmological term .",
    "this bound is perfectly compatible with the physical interpretation of @xmath300 from its definition ( [ nu ] ) .",
    "moreover , our analysis indicates that the cosmon entity @xmath12 behaves as `` phantom matter''@xcite , i.e. it satisfies @xmath362 with negative energy density .",
    "this result is a clear symptom ( actually an expected one ) from its effective nature .",
    "it is also a welcome feature ; let us recall@xcite that `` phantom matter '' , in contrast to the `` standard '' phantom energy , prevents the universe from reaching the big rip singularity . finally , perhaps the most noticeable ( and experimentally accessible ) feature that we have uncovered from the analysis of the de perturbations in the @xmath3xcdm model , is that the overall eos parameter @xmath16 associated to the total de density @xmath0 behaves effectively as quintessence ( @xmath241 ) in precisely the region of parameter space where the cosmic coincidence problem can be solved . in other words ,",
    "quintessence is mimicked by the @xmath3xcdm model in that relevant region , despite that there is no fundamental quintessence field in the present framework .",
    "a detailed confrontation of the various predictions of the @xmath3xcdm model ( in particular , the kind of dependence @xmath520 ) with the future accurate experimental data@xcite , may eventually reveal these features and even allow to distinguish this model from alternative de proposals based on fundamental quintessence fields .",
    "to summarize : we have demonstrated that the set of cosmological models characterized by a composite , and covariantly conserved , de density @xmath0 in which the vacuum energy @xmath23 is a dynamical component ( specifically , one that evolves quadratically with the expansion rate , see eq.([runlamb ] ) ) , proves to be a distinguished class of models that may provide a consistent explanation of why @xmath0 is near @xmath1 , in full compatibility with the theory of cosmological perturbations and the rest of the cosmological data .",
    "remarkably , such class of models is suggested by the above mentioned renormalization group approach to cosmology .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath3xcdm model can be looked upon as a rather predictive framework that may offer a robust , and theoretically motivated , dynamical solution to the cosmic coincidence problem .",
