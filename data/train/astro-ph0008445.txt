    "the outer solar system has recently been found to be populated by a vast number of minor bodies ( e.g. , jewitt , luu , & chen 1996 , jedicke & herron 1997 , jewitt , luu , & trujillo 1998 ) . as of june 2000",
    "there are 20 objects , known as centaurs , which have semi - major axes and perihelia between jupiter and neptune and over 300 objects , known as kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , which have semi - major axes greater than that of neptune .",
    "centaurs are believed to have originated from the kuiper belt and are now in dynamically unstable orbits that will lead either to ejection from the solar system , an impact with a planet or the sun , or evolution into a short period comet .",
    "the brightest known kbo , other than pluto - charon , has apparent red magnitude @xmath15 , whereas several centaurs are brighter than this . with current technology , physical and chemical properties of only the biggest and brightest minor bodies in the outer solar system can be studied .",
    "centaurs and kbos could be the most primitive bodies in the solar system and represent a unique opportunity to probe the early history of the local solar nebula .",
    "the cumulative luminosity function ( clf ) describes the sky - plane surface density of objects brighter than a given magnitude .",
    "little work has been done on the clf of centaurs ( jewitt et al .",
    "1996 , levison & duncan 1997 ) , but the clf of kbos is well - defined between magnitudes @xmath16 ( gladman  et  al .",
    "1998 , jewitt et al .",
    "1998 , luu & jewitt 1998 , chiang & brown 1999 ) .",
    "the bright end of the kbo clf is very uncertain because bright kbos are rare and a limited amount of sky has been searched .",
    "the extrapolated clf currently predicts about one kbo of @xmath17 per 500 square degrees of sky .",
    "observations with possible bearings on large bodies in the outer solar system include the high eccentricities and inclinations of kbos which could have come from massive planetesimals in the outer solar system ( morbidelli & valsecchi 1997 ) and the obliquity of uranus s spin axis that might imply a collision with a massive body ( singer 1975 ) .",
    "evolution of the outer solar system suggests a more massive disk was needed in the primordial kuiper belt to explain its current population size structure ( stern 1996a ) . a detailed accretion model of the early kuiper belt by kenyon & luu ( 1999 ) showed several pluto sized objects could form within the age of the solar system .",
    "direct evidence for large objects in the outer solar system includes the large irregular satellite triton , as well as the pluto - charon system . to constrain the clf of both the centaurs and kbos at @xmath18 requires searches covering large sky areas .",
    "to date large surveys have been conducted using photographic plates which are difficult to parametrize .",
    "a list of surveys which have covered @xmath19 deg@xmath0 and which had temporal sampling sufficient to detect centaurs and/or kbos is given in table  1 .",
    "considering that relatively little of the sky has been searched for these slow moving objects ( smos ) , and that recent advances in ccd technology have made large area surveys feasible , this is an excellent time to search for bright smos .",
    "accordingly , we undertook a wide - field survey in search of bright objects in the outer solar system .",
    "the 0.5 meter diameter automated patrol telescope ( apt ) at siding spring observatory in australia was used during 3 observing runs in early 1999 .",
    "the apt is a modified baker - nunn camera using a 3-element lens to achieve a corrected wide field of view ( carter et al .",
    "it was originally designed to track satellites in earth orbit .",
    "we used a @xmath20 pixel ccd manufactured by eev with 22.5 @xmath21 pixels and a pixel scale of 9.41@xmath22/pixel at the f/1 focal plane for imaging .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the detector is 0.46 in the r - band .",
    "the detector has a @xmath23 rectangular field of view with the east - west direction aligned parallel to the long axis .",
    "exposures were taken using a johnson r - band filter and the telescope was tracked at sidereal rate .",
    "the apt site is exceptionally dark .",
    "the seeing was usually around 1.5@xmath22 as measured from other telescopes on the mountain . at the apt",
    "the large pixel scale did not allow us to directly measure the seeing and moderate variations in seeing were not noticeable .",
    "the data were undersampled which made it difficult to distinguish between galaxies and stars ( figure  1 ) .",
    "a total of 238 independent fields covering 1428 deg@xmath0 of sky were imaged during observing runs centered around new moon in january , february , and march 1999 ( table  2 ) .",
    "a map of the sky areas searched is shown in figure  2 and the specific field centers are given in table  3 ( the complete extended table  3 is provided in the electronic version of this paper ) .",
    "the fields were selected to be observed at an airmass @xmath24 and be within 30 degrees of the ecliptic .",
    "selection of the fields was made with no prior knowledge of known smos in the area .",
    "the search was made between @xmath25 and @xmath26 degrees of the ecliptic .",
    "the observational strategy was to search within @xmath27 hr of opposition . at opposition the movement of an object",
    "is simply related to heliocentric distance by @xmath28 where @xmath29(au ) is the heliocentric distance and @xmath30 ( arcsec hr@xmath3 ) is the rate of change of apparent position of the smo on the ccd . from equation",
    "[ eq : motion ] , kbos with @xmath31  au will have @xmath30 @xmath32  hr@xmath3 ( @xmath33 pixels per day ) and centaurs with @xmath34  au have @xmath35  hr@xmath36  hr@xmath3 ( between 10 and 50 pixels per day ) .",
    "therefore we sought kbos and centaurs by comparing images taken on successive nights , allowing the detection of objects moving at rates between @xmath2 hr@xmath3 and @xmath4 hr@xmath3 .",
    "trailing of both kbos and centaurs was negligible due to the large pixels , slow movement of the objects , and short integration times .",
    "three consecutive exposures of 200 seconds each were taken on each of 3 separate nights yielding 9 images per field .",
    "weather permitting , the fields were imaged on consecutive nights .",
    "the images were bias and dark subtracted , then flat fielded with median twilight skyflats .",
    "the 3 images of a field taken during a single night were registered , then combined using the iraf `` crreject '' cosmic ray rejection algorithm to remove cosmic rays and increase signal - to - noise .",
    "these 3 images were taken consecutively so there was little or no telescope motion between them .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars were used for photometric calibration .",
    "field centers differed by up to 50 arcseconds from night to night due to apt pointing variations .",
    "we aligned the fields from different nights by eye .",
    "the data were analyzed in two complementary ways , a ) by visual `` blinking '' and b ) using an automated search algorithm .",
    "for the visual analysis , four criteria were used for smo identification : ( 1 ) the object must appear in all three frames , ( 2 ) it must have linear motion , ( 3 ) it must have a steady brightness in all 3 frames , and ( 4 ) it must have constant velocity appropriate for an smo ( @xmath37 hr@xmath3 ) . many asteroids between magnitudes 10 and 19 were quickly identified and rejected by their large motions ( @xmath3850 pixels in 24 hours ) .",
    "they were not followed up with further observations because of limited telescope time .",
    "centaur 10199 chariklo ( provisional designation 1997  cu26 ) was at @xmath39 when detected serendipitously ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it was discovered independently by the visual and automated procedures with no knowledge of its location in the field .",
    "no other known smos in the area searched were bright enough to be detected by our survey .",
    "it should also be noted that the january fields were crowded due to the close proximity of the galactic plane to opposition , while the march fields were hampered by bad weather . during poor weather , the few fields with gaps of 2 or 3 days were observed on 4 nights instead of the usual 3 to ensure that smo identification efficiency was not significantly reduced compared to fields taken on 3 consecutive nights .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the survey was found by randomly placing 100 artificial smos onto a subset of the images . a moffat profile ( moffat 1969 ) matched to the point spread function of the apt",
    "was used to generate the artificial smos .",
    "the visual detection efficiencies for kbos and centaurs are shown as a function of magnitude in table  4 . a kbo detection efficiency equal to half the maximum efficiency was reached at @xmath1 , which we take as the limiting magnitude of this survey .",
    "the centaur detection efficiency equal to half the maximum efficiency was also reached near @xmath1 .    as a complement to the visual smo search ,",
    "a moving object detection program was used to flag potential smo candidates for scrutinization .",
    "the algorithm was optimized for our undersampled data .",
    "objects were detected in each image by searching for maxima in the center of a @xmath40 pixel box .",
    "an approximate signal - to - noise and flux for the object was then determined using all pixels within the @xmath41 pixel box with flux more than @xmath42 above the sky background .",
    "while this underestimated the flux of extended objects , it provided a good estimate of the flux of faint undersampled stellar images , which occupied 1 to 4 pixels depending on the location of the image centroid with respect to the pixel grid . using catalogues of objects in each field with signal - to - noise greater than 4 ,",
    "the software removed stationary objects by searching for objects within @xmath43 pixel of the same position in multiple images .",
    "stationary objects with fluxes that varied by more than a factor of 2 are retained in the catalogue as these could be blended objects .",
    "the program then flags `` objects '' with a consistent rate of motion between @xmath44  hr@xmath3 and @xmath45  hr@xmath3 within @xmath46 of the projected direction of the ecliptic .",
    "candidates with fluxes varying by more than a factor of 5 were rejected as these were dominated by spurious objects and variable stars .",
    "the software successfully detected centaur chariklo , which was not unexpected as it was more than a magnitude brighter than the survey limit .",
    "as with searching for candidates by eye , the detection efficiency was determined by searching for artificial smos .",
    "the average detection efficiency as a function of magnitude is summarized in table  5 .",
    "the kbo detection rate of half the maximum value was reached at @xmath47 and is the limiting magnitude for the automated detection technique .",
    "the code is not as effective as the eye at deblending merged objects , so the @xmath48 magnitude limit is @xmath49 magnitudes brighter than that determined by eye .",
    "however , in high galactic latitude fields , the efficiency of the code improved significantly with @xmath50 of @xmath51 kbos being detected .",
    "a total of 238 fields were examined covering 1428 square degrees of sky ( about 3.5@xmath52 of the whole sky ) .",
    "no new smos were detected .",
    "one previously discovered centaur ( chariklo ) was serendipitously detected . from the one detected centaur and the efficiency of this survey we found the empirical projected surface density of centaurs to be @xmath53 assuming poisson statistics , the @xmath6 upper confidence limit for the projected surface density of kbos from our survey is @xmath54 we plot these and cumulative surface density measurements from other surveys for centaurs and kbos in figures  3 and  5 , respectively .",
    "error bars were calculated at @xmath55 confidence from detection efficiencies and poisson error statistics when not explicitly given in the published papers ( gehrels 1986 ) . quoted upper limits are poisson @xmath6 confidence limits .",
    "the clf is modeled by @xmath56=\\alpha ( m_{r}-m_{o } )   \\label{eq : slope}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the number of objects per square degree brighter than @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the magnitude at which @xmath60  deg@xmath61 , and 10@xmath62 describes the slope of the luminosity function .",
    "the current state of the clf of centaurs is shown in figure  3 .",
    "almost half of the known centaurs have been found by the spacewatch program ( jedicke & herron 1997 , mcmillan 1999 ) .",
    "the parameters of the spacewatch survey have changed with time as the detector and observing strategy have been modified .",
    "robert mcmillan , head of the spacewatch program , kindly provided estimates of the spacewatch survey parameters ( table  1 ) .",
    "spacewatch points in figures 3 and 4 were calculated using the total area searched with the number of centaurs found .",
    "they are lower limits since the effective area searched is less than the reported total area searched due to some observations in marginal observing conditions and some areas covered multiple times .",
    "kowal s ( 1989 ) centaur constraint is plotted with a sizeable uncertainty because of the large trailing losses incurred in long ( 75 minute ) photographic integrations on ( relatively ) fast moving centaurs .",
    "the clf of the kuiper belt ( c.f .",
    "section 3.2 ) is overplotted on the centaur data in figure  3 .",
    "a line of the same slope has been vertically shifted to run through the points having one or more centaur detections .",
    "the offset line is consistent with every observational point shown in figure  3 , within the uncertainties of measurement .",
    "the centaurs reach @xmath63 deg@xmath61 at @xmath64 .",
    "thus , centaurs have an apparent sky - plane - density about 10 times less than that of the kbos at a given magnitude .",
    "the clf represents the convolved effects of the size and distance distributions of the objects .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was used to determine the total number of centaurs larger than a certain radius .",
    "the centaurs were assumed to follow a differential power - law radius distribution of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants , @xmath68 is the radius of the centaur , and @xmath69 is the number of centaurs with radii in the range @xmath68 to @xmath70 .",
    "the radii of the centaurs were assumed to lie between @xmath71 and @xmath72 . to find the total number of centaurs , we adopted @xmath73  km ( since the smaller short period comets are about this size ) , and @xmath74 1000  km ( about the size of the largest known trans - neptunian body , pluto ) .",
    "the derived total number of centaurs is insensitive to @xmath72 .",
    "the surface density distribution of centaurs in the plane of the ecliptic varies with heliocentric distance and was assumed to be a power law of the form @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constants , @xmath29 is the heliocentric distance , and @xmath78 is the number of objects with heliocentric distance in the range @xmath29 to @xmath79 . the heliocentric distance was taken between 10 and 30 au .",
    "a @xmath80 was chosen as the most likely centaur distance distribution based on the simulation by levison and duncan ( 1997 ) .",
    "the monte carlo simulation was performed by randomly choosing a distance and radius for up to @xmath81 centaurs from the two power law equations above .",
    "each centaur s apparent magnitude at opposition was then calculated using @xmath82 in which @xmath68 is in km , @xmath29 is in au , @xmath83 is the geocentric distance in au taken here to be @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the apparent red magnitude of the sun ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath58 is the apparent red magnitude of the centaur , @xmath87 is the geometric red albedo assumed to be 0.04 , and @xmath88 is the phase function in which the phase angle @xmath89 deg at opposition and thus @xmath90 .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulation using @xmath91 , 4.0 , and 4.5 are shown in figure  4 .",
    "we obtained the total number of centaurs with @xmath92  km by normalizing the simulation to the clf of the centaurs at @xmath93 .",
    "we assumed the inclination distribution extends to @xmath94 degrees in latitude from the ecliptic : the total sky area occupied by centaurs is then about 20000 deg@xmath0 .",
    "we used the relation @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the cumulative number of centaurs with radius greater than @xmath68 to find @xmath66 .",
    "table  6 shows the results for the number of centaurs using different assumed values of the main parameters . for the @xmath97 index we found",
    "there are about @xmath9 centaurs with @xmath92  km .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath67 of @xmath98 correspond to uncertainties in the population of factors 3 to 4 .",
    "plausible uncertainties in @xmath77 have a smaller effect ( table  6 ) .    the @xmath91 , 4.0 and 4.5 curves are all consistent with the centaur clf ( figure  4 ) .",
    "if we use the closest fit @xmath97 simulation we obtain @xmath99  km@xmath100 ( table  6 ) .",
    "the number of centaurs with @xmath101  km is comparable to the 300 main - belt asteroids ( tedesco  1989 ) in this size regime but much smaller than the @xmath102 kbos expected with @xmath101  km ( jewitt et al .",
    "our result is about an order of magnitude smaller than the result obtained by jewitt et al .",
    "these authors detected 2 centaurs in a narrow field survey and crudely estimated the centaur population based on only 1 of the centaurs and in the absence of a model of the centaur radial distance distribution .",
    "jedicke & herron ( 1997 ) found , at the @xmath103 confidence level , that there must be fewer than 250 centaurs with @xmath101  km ( we scaled the quoted value for @xmath104  km in jedicke & herron ( 1997 ) to @xmath101  km using a q=4 index for the size distribution ) and they also concluded there are 3 or fewer centaurs with @xmath105  km . although all three results are consistent , our simulation using the clf in figure  3 presumably provides a superior estimate of the population since more centaurs are now known and a model of the distance distribution has been incorporated .    assuming the centaurs are supplied by the kbos , in steady - state we should have @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the number of centaurs , @xmath108 is the number of kbos , @xmath109 is the average centaur lifetime , and @xmath110 is the average kbo lifetime . for kbos @xmath111 years ( quinn et al .",
    "1990 ) and for centaurs @xmath112 to @xmath113 years ( hahn & bailey 1990 , asher & steel 1993 , levison & duncan 1997 ) . with @xmath114 ( @xmath101  km )",
    "kbos ( jewitt et al . 1998 ) , we expect @xmath115 to @xmath116 ( @xmath101  km ) centaurs based on the steady state assumption .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath117 estimated here from the clf , and consistent with the kuiper belt supplying the centaur population .",
    "since the average centaur lifetime expressed in years is similar to the number of centaurs with radii greater than 1  km ( @xmath118 ) , about one centaur with @xmath119  km must be delivered to the gas giant region per year .",
    "duncan et al . (",
    "1995 ) found the fraction of kbos which leave the kuiper belt from planetary interactions is @xmath120 per year . assuming that half of the kbos which leave the kuiper belt end up as centaurs , then with @xmath102 kbos of @xmath12150 km and a centaur lifetime of @xmath122 to @xmath113 years we would expect between 2 to 20 centaurs to be present with radii @xmath38  50  km , consistent with our results .    for a @xmath97 size distribution",

    ", we obtain @xmath129 kg ( @xmath130  m@xmath131 ) for the current total mass of the centaurs .",
    "assuming centaurs have a lifetime of @xmath132 years and are in steady state we find that 0.1 m@xmath131 has been cycled through the centaurs during the @xmath133 year age of the solar system .",
    "if objects as large as pluto ( @xmath134  km ) with @xmath135  kg  m@xmath125 are considered then the mass cycled through the centaurs during the age of the solar system is about 2.5 times greater than the above result . either way it is comparable to the inferred total mass currently in the kuiper belt of @xmath1360.2  m@xmath131 ( jewitt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "centaurs are close enough to the sun to show cometary activity ( e.g. , chiron ) , which can lead to an overestimate of their size if assuming a constant albedo , as we have done .",
    "observationally , most surveys are only sensitive to bright ( large ) centaurs .",
    "thus the smaller centaur population was obtained by extrapolating from larger centaurs which may not follow the same distribution .",
    "no survey has been specifically targeted at detecting centaurs .",
    "most surveys which have found centaurs are optimized instead for finding kbos or asteroids .",
    "this makes it hard to assess the sensitivity to centaurs of some published surveys .",
    "surveys plotted in figure  3 are those which were capable of finding centaurs in at least the range of heliocentric distances 10  au to 30  au .",
    "our survey was sensitive to centaurs from 5 to 30  au .",
    "only 4 of the 20 currently known centaurs could have radii @xmath19  km ( assuming geometric albedo 0.04 ) and our simulation predicts @xmath137 such objects in the whole sky .",
    "most of them would be located near but inside the orbit of neptune , with apparent red magnitudes near 23 .",
    "they would have naturally escaped detection in most wide field surveys conducted to date .",
    "surface densities of kbos from different surveys are in reasonable agreement between @xmath16 ( figure  5 ) .",
    "a weighted least squares fit to the clf for all the data with at least one detection is shown in figure  5 ( we used only the middle of the three tombaugh points in the fit ) , yielding @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the fit is consistent with the fits found by jewitt  et  al .",

    "our survey s @xmath6 upper limit is consistent with the constant slope of the clf but does not rule out a steepening in the clf for @xmath146 .    the above and some other previous works have improperly calculated the surface density from tombaugh s ( 1961 ) survey ( see table  1 for the correct results of tombaugh s survey ) .",
    "they used tombaugh s follow up survey which was conducted to search for satellites or other objects that might be near pluto .",
    "this survey reached @xmath147 and covered 1530 square degrees of sky .",
    "however , pluto was discovered in a survey which reached only @xmath148 and covered about 28000 deg@xmath0 , initiated earlier and continued later ( table 1 ) .",
    "the 1530 square degree survey should be interpreted as a null result since pluto was not detected serendipitously .",
    "therefore , the tombaugh datum used in some earlier works should be shifted to brighter magnitudes and lower surface densities .",
    "the kuiper belt was first thought to be collisionless though it now appears collisional effects might be very important ( davis & farinella 1997 ) .",
    "this has the result of removing the primitive and possibly unprocessed material from kbos and might allow for dust to be observed in the kuiper belt .",
    "the collision products might be seen directly by the detection of dust clouds around the kbos ( alcock & hut 1993 , stern 1996b ) .",

    "the characteristic expansion time of a cloud is @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the expansion velocity and @xmath68 is the radius of the expanding cloud .",
    "the velocity of the ejected material depends on the energy of the impact and size of the projectile and target .",

    "the cloud should reach peak brightness in reflected light when its optical depth is unity .",
    "the time to reach peak brightness is @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the critical radius at which optical depth unity is reached .",

    "if constant density is assumed then the critical radius is just the square root of the geometric cross - section of the particles ( @xmath156^{1.5}$ ] where @xmath157 is the average radius of particles created from the initial projectile radius of @xmath158 ) .",
    "the duration of visibility depends on the limiting magnitude .",
    "using typical values of @xmath159 to 5  km  s@xmath3 ( the approximate expansion velocity of gas produced by impact vaporization ) and a constant size of 0.1 to 10@xmath21 for particles in the cloud we find that a dust cloud should reach optical depth unity in only a few days and be brighter than red magnitude 19 for about 20 to 100 days .",
    "if 100 clouds are produced in one year and each is visible for 50 days about 14 clouds should be visible at any instant . with 14 clouds in 20,000 square degrees , we expect to find one cloud for every 1430 square degrees of sky .",
    "owing to the large pixels of the apt our survey would not resolve one of these collision clouds if in our field of view , though we would detect the kbo type movement of any clouds brighter than @xmath1 .",
    "no dust clouds brighter than @xmath1 were detected in 1428 square degrees of sky searched in this survey .",

    "this also puts a @xmath6 limit of @xmath13 clouds produced per year with @xmath14 .",
    "more sky must be searched to determine if pluto is just one of several other large kbos waiting to be discovered .",
    "if the amount of sky searched for slow moving objects were doubled , strong constraints on the bright end of the kbo clf would be obtained .",
    "this survey was hindered by the large pixel size of the ccd .",
    "currently ccds four times as large and with pixels half the size are routinely available .",
    "it is our goal to continue to survey the sky for bright smos with a bigger ccd and smaller pixels .",
