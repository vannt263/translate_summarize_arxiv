    "we consider a homogenous and isotropic conducting body , assumed to be contained in @xmath0 , a bounded , lipschitz domain of @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that there exist @xmath3 , a lipschitz domain contained in , and different from , @xmath0 , and a closed set @xmath4 such that the interior of @xmath5 is not empty and @xmath5 has a positive distance from @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is known and accessible to measurements",
    ".    in the body there might be present some defects , which we assume to be perfectly insulating and outside @xmath3 .",
    "namely , we model these defects by a closed set @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is empty .",
    "we notice that @xmath9 represents the union of the boundaries of these defects and that we denote with @xmath10 the connected component of @xmath11 containing @xmath3 , that is the region of @xmath0 reachable from @xmath5 without crossing @xmath9 .",
    "the defects may have different geometrical properties .",
    "for instance , we may have , even at the same time , _ cracks _ ( either interior or surface - breaking ) , or _ material losses _ ( either interior , that is cavities , or at the boundary ) .",
    "we recall that a defect @xmath9 is a _ material loss _ if @xmath10 coincides with the interior of its closure .",
    "let us consider the following experiment . if a current density @xmath12 is applied on @xmath5 , then the electrostatic potential in @xmath0 , @xmath13 , is the solution to the following ( normalized ) neumann boundary value problem @xmath14 the current density is modeled by a function @xmath15 , for some constant @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 .",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath18 may then be measured on @xmath5 .",
    "we call such a measurement @xmath19 and we observe that @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in this way we obtain an electrostatic boundary measurement of voltage , @xmath22 , and current , @xmath12 , type on @xmath5 . in mathematical words",
    ", we measure the cauchy data @xmath23 of the harmonic function @xmath18 on @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , prescribed the current @xmath12 , the voltage @xmath22 depends on @xmath9 . if @xmath9 is unknown , then the measured voltage @xmath22 may provide information about the unknown defect .",
    "in fact , the aim of the inverse problem is to reconstruct an unknown defect @xmath9 by prescribing one or more current densities @xmath12 and measuring the corresponding value of the potentials on @xmath5 .",
    "such a problem arises , for instance , in non - destructive evaluation , for the determination of flaws like cracks or cavities in conducting bodies by non - invasive methods .",
    "we refer to this problem as the _ inverse crack problem _ , in the general case . instead , when we a priori know that the defect is a material loss , we denote it as the _ inverse cavity problem_. for results on the inverse crack problem and related problems , we refer to the review article @xcite .",
    "here we simply wish to note that a single measurement ( that is performing the experiment previously described only once ) is enough to determine uniquely a material loss . in the general crack case , instead",
    ", one measurement may not be enough , however two suitably chosen measurements ( corresponding to two suitable prescribed current densities ) are enough for unique identification of any kind of defects at least in the planar case .",
    "let us remark here that if the unknown defect is a priori assumed to be interior ( that is @xmath24 and if the whole boundary of @xmath0 is accessible , then we may simply take @xmath25 .",
    "our approach to this inverse problem is the following .",
    "we observe that @xmath18 is smooth outside @xmath9 , whereas it may , and generally does , jump across @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , starting from the cauchy data , we wish to reconstruct the function @xmath18 in @xmath0 , and in particular its discontinuity set @xmath26 .",
    "we notice that this is not a classical cauchy problem for @xmath18 , since @xmath18 is harmonic in @xmath11 with @xmath9 unknown !",
    "rather , it looks more like a free - discontinuity problem for @xmath18 , since its discontinuity set @xmath26 is unknown and it is actually the aim of our reconstruction .",
    "if we are able to reconstruct @xmath18 and @xmath26 , then we obtain valuable information on @xmath9 , given the fact the @xmath27 .",
    "actually , for the inverse cavity problem , @xmath26 determines the whole @xmath28 . on the contrary , in the inverse crack problem",
    ", it may happen that a crack is not visible for a particular measurement , that is @xmath26 does not detect the whole @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", we may change the prescribed current density , reconstruct again the electrostatic potential from its values on @xmath5 , and recover another portion of @xmath28 .",
    "the uniqueness results tell us how many times and with which kind of prescribed current densities we need to repeat this procedure to fully reconstruct the unknown defect .",
    "the main difficulties in the reconstruction of @xmath18 from its cauchy data are the following .",
    "first of all , the problem is severely ill - posed , as cauchy problems for elliptic equations are .",
    "second , since the potential @xmath18 to be reconstructed is a discontinuous function whose discontinuities are unknown ( actually they are the aim of our reconstruction ) , the problem is not even linear .",
    "thus all the main difficulties of the original inverse problem are still present in the reconstruction of @xmath18 .",
    "the way to tackle ill - posedness is crucial .",
    "in fact , since the boundary data are measured , the data which are really available are not the exact cauchy data @xmath23 but some noisy perturbation of them .",
    "namely , the available data we assume to know are @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 belongs to @xmath31 and satisfies @xmath32 and @xmath33 , whereas @xmath34 belongs to @xmath35 and satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , denotes the noise level .",
    "as mentioned , rather than a classical cauchy problem , we consider such a reconstruction as a free - discontinuity problem for the unknown potential @xmath18 .",
    "we follow the variational approach developed in @xcite for cracks and material losses , respectively .",
    "such a method is based on the following two features .",
    "the first one is the choice of the regularization . in order to regularize the problem a perimeter - like penalization",
    "namely , we penalize the @xmath40-dimensional measure of the unknown defect @xmath9 ( actually of the discontinuity set of the unknown potential ) .",
    "second , we model discontinuity sets through phase - field functions , thus obtaining a formulation in which a discontinuous function @xmath41 and its discontinuity set @xmath42 are replaced , respectively , by a smooth function @xmath41 and by a smooth phase - field function @xmath43 .",
    "such a formulation is amenable to numerical implementation .    in particular , for the crack case , in @xcite",
    "it has been used a regularization based on the so - called mumford - shah functional , @xcite , and its approximation , in the sense of @xmath44-convergence , with phase - field functionals due to ambrosio and tortorelli , @xcite . for material losses , @xcite , it has been used a more classical perimeter penalization and its approximation , again in the sense of @xmath44-convergence , with phase - field functionals due to modica and mortola , @xcite . for further details on free - discontinuity problems and their approximations",
    "we refer for instance to @xcite .",
    "in this paper we develop the numerics of the approach in @xcite .",
    "the convergence analysis done in these papers provides a justification of the numerical method , in particular for the material loss case , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.2 ) . for what concerns the crack case , we do not have a precise convergence result for the method implemented here .",
    "however this is quite simpler from a numerical point of view than the one developed in @xcite and for which we have convergence results .",
    "moreover we believe that this simplification might still lead to good reconstructions , see also the discussion in section  5 of @xcite .",
    "we shall use the following notation .",
    "we fix a constant @xmath45 , depending on some regularity properties of the defect @xmath9 to be reconstructed .",
    "namely , we assume that there exist a constant @xmath45 and a constant @xmath46 , independent of @xmath12 , such that @xmath47 where @xmath13 solves ( [ dirpbm ] ) .",
    "we also set @xmath48    the function @xmath49 is continuous and non - decreasing and such that @xmath50 , @xmath51 if @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "then , for @xmath39 , we define @xmath54    we introduce a single - well potential @xmath55 centered at @xmath56 , that is a non - negative continuous function such that @xmath57 if and only if @xmath58 .",
    "we shall also need a double - well potential @xmath59 centered at @xmath60 and @xmath56 , that is a non - negative continuous function such that @xmath61 if and only if @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that the functions @xmath59 , @xmath55 and @xmath63 are @xmath64 and are bounded all over @xmath65 and also their derivatives are bounded and uniformly continuous all over @xmath65 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are hlder continuous for some exponent @xmath69 , @xmath70 , all over @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , the following assumption will be made .",
    "about @xmath63 we require that for any @xmath71 we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 for any @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , we have that @xmath75 .",
    "we also require that for any @xmath71 we have @xmath76 .",
    "obviously , we have that , for any @xmath71 , @xmath77 , and , for any @xmath74 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    for example",
    ", the following choices may be made .",
    "for any @xmath80 $ ] @xmath81 with straightforward extensions beyond @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "we define the space @xmath83 . to any @xmath84 we associate the function @xmath85 .",
    "we remark that @xmath86 and @xmath87 almost everywhere in @xmath3 .",
    "we finally fix positive tuning parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and a noise level @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "all these constants and the notation will be kept fixed throughout the paper .",
    "basically , the method is the following . beginning from the crack case",
    ", we wish to minimize , with respect to the phase - field variable @xmath84 , with the constraint @xmath91 , the functional @xmath92 , which is defined as follows . for any @xmath84 , recalling that @xmath85 , we set @xmath93 here @xmath94 solves @xmath95    we notice that the first term is the fidelity term with respect to the measured boundary datum , the other three terms are the ambrosio - tortorelli functional .",
    "the link with the prescribed boundary datum and with the presence of cracks is through @xmath96 , the solution of the weighted elliptic equation .",
    "we observe that the single - well potential @xmath55 forces the phase - field function @xmath85 to be equal to @xmath56 except in a small region , which is where the crack should be located .",
    "the tuning parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 allow to put more emphasis on one or the other of the features of the functional .",
    "namely , @xmath88 controls the match with the dirichlet datum , @xmath89 the smoothness of the reconstructed potential away from its discontinuities and @xmath90 the penalization on the @xmath40-dimensional measure of the discontinuities .",
    "therefore @xmath90 may be seen as a regularization parameter .",
    "for the material loss case , we simply replace the single - well potential @xmath55 with the double - well potential @xmath59 .",
    "namely , we define @xmath97 in an analogous way by simply replacing @xmath55 with @xmath59 , that is , for any @xmath84 , we set @xmath98 we then minimize , with respect to the phase - field variable @xmath84 , with the constraint @xmath91 , the functional @xmath99 .",
    "we notice that in this case the last two terms are the modica - mortola functional , which penalizes the perimeter of @xmath10 in @xmath0 . here",
    "the double - well potential @xmath59 forces the phase - field function @xmath43 to be either @xmath60 ( inside the material loss ) or @xmath56 ( outside the material loss ) , with a quick transition between these two regions .    summarizing , we shall minimize the functional @xmath100 , when we aim to reconstruct defects such as cracks , and the functional @xmath99 , when we aim to reconstruct material losses .",
    "namely , we wish to solve numerically the following minimization problems ( depending on the properties of the unknown defect @xmath9 )    a.   @xmath101 on @xmath102 , with the constraint @xmath91 , if @xmath9 contains portions of cracks .",
    "b.   @xmath103 on @xmath102 , with the constraint @xmath91 , if @xmath9 is a material loss defect .",
    "let us notice that , by the direct method , these minimum problems admit a solution .    about the numerical method , in order to find the minimizers , we formulate the corresponding optimality system and we use a gradient method , see section  [ optsec ] for details . in section [ numsec ] numerical simulations",
    "are presented for both the single- and double - well approximations .",
    "numerical experiments are performed for various types of defects with noise - free and noisy data - sets .",

    "as mentioned above , the update @xmath244 is discretized using linear triangular elements on a regular grid . to find @xmath244 we have to solve an elliptic equations with system matrix defined by a discretization of the operator @xmath245 . in our 2-dimensional test examples",
    ", we always set @xmath246 and for any @xmath216 we set @xmath247 where @xmath43 solves in a weak sense @xmath248 with some parameter @xmath249 and homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the choice of dirichlet boundary conditions is motivated by the desire to keep the phase - field constantly at the value 1 on the boundary .",
    "the assembling of the right - hand side of the equation for @xmath244 is done by evaluating ( [ dvweak0 ] ) for piecewise linear in all bases functions @xmath111 .    the projection required in step 4",
    "is easily implemented for piecewise linear functions by thresholding the nodal values . moreover , a suitable step - length for the update of the phase - field is found using an armijo - type line search .",
    "we use a maximum number of five reduction steps for the correction of the step - length .",
    "since each evaluation of the cost functional requires one solution of the state equation , we try to steer the step - size modification in a rather conservative way .    within this setup , the following numerical experiments have been performed .",
    "for all experiments , the phase - field parameter @xmath38 was decreased in several steps from an initial value of @xmath250 down to @xmath251 for the single - well potential and to @xmath252 for the double - well case .",
    "we run 2500 iterations of our algorithm in the single - well case and 1000 in the double - well case .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the final phase - field together with the linear crack ( as a white line ) which was used for the data generation .",
    "we use all six available data - sets with electrode positions on ( up / down ) , ( left / right ) , ( down / left ) , ( up / left ) , ( down / right ) , and ( up / right ) sides of the rectangle for the reconstruction and set the noise - level to zero . in this simple situation where the crack is located rather close to the boundary",
    "we obtain very good reconstruction of the crack location with the single - well approximation .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "it is shown a comparison between reconstructions using 3 measurements ( left image ) with electrode positions on ( left / right ) , ( left / up ) , and ( right / up ) edges and 6 measurements ( right figure ) , again in the single - well case .",
    "it is notable that in the reconstruction with 3 data - sets the crack tips are accurately identified but the reconstructed crack is strongly curved which is probably due to the fact that we have no electrode located on the lower edge of the computational domain .",
    "in contrast the overall geometrical shape of the crack is reconstructed much better with 6 data - sets but the position of the crack tips is less accurate . in these two simulations",
    "we added one percent of normally distributed noise to neumann and dirichlet data .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows results for a situation with two cracks and different noise levels . here",
    "we fixed the noise - level for the neumann data to 1% for both experiments whereas the dirichlet data were contaminated with 1% ( left image ) and 5% ( right image ) of noise .",
    "we used three measurements ( left / right ) , ( left / up ) , ( right / up ) and the single - well potential . there is no big difference in the quality of the reconstructions . in both cases",
    "the placement of the smaller crack in the upper right corner is inaccurate and the larger crack in the lower left corner is curved .",
    "nonetheless the convergence of the algorithm is not heavily effected by the presence of ( moderately strong ) noise and the reconstructions are stable .",
    "the next series of experiments presented in figure [ fig4 ] shows the tendency of the single - well based algorithm to produce dendrite - like structures .",
    "in fact , the dendrite - shaped crack in the leftmost image is reconstructed quite well .",
    "the polygonal crack in the middle image is approximated by a cloth - hanger like structure which has a satisfactory data fit with a shorter overall length than the polygonal curve .",
    "finally the cavity in the rightmost image is approximated by a one - dimensional structure which looks roughly like the skeleton of the cavity . in all these three experiments",
    "noise level is 1% for neumann data and 5% for dirichlet data and the three measurements ( left / right ) , ( left / up ) , ( right / up ) are used .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows reconstructions obtained by using the double - well approximation . as expected , the phase - field approximates the characteristic functions of one cavity ( left image ) and two cavities ( right image ) . in these two tests noise level",
    "is 1% for neumann data . in the left image noise level for dirichlet data is 5% and the three measurements ( left / right ) , ( left / up ) , ( right / up ) are used . in the right image noise level for dirichlet data is 1% but only one measurement , namely ( left / right ) , is used .",
    "the overall location of the cavities is satisfactory , but the lower left quadrilateral is approximated by a non - convex shape . in this respect",
    "the experiment with the double - well potential for two cavities resembles the results shown in figure [ fig2 ] where the lower left crack also has a strong tendency to bend inward .    for our final numerical experiment , documented in figure [ fig5 ] ,",
    "the double - well approach was used for the reconstruction of one - dimensional defects like the polygonal crack shown in the left image and the star - shaped crack shown on the right - hand side of the figure . in both cases",
    "the defect is approximated by a two dimensional structure .",
    "an interesting feature is the occurrence of a self - intersection of the boundary curve of the reconstructed defect in the case of the star - shaped crack .",
    "also in these two final tests , noise level is 1% for neumann data and 5% for dirichlet data and the three measurements ( left / right ) , ( left / up ) , ( right / up ) are used .    as a conclusion we can state that both algorithms give reconstructions of the defects with a satisfactory accuracy for an exponentially ill - posed problem .",
    "the algorithms show a quite stable behaviour in the presence of data noise .",
    "the single - well and double - well models develop the types of structures for which they are designed ( one - dimensional for the single - well and two dimensional for the double - well potential ) , so the single - well approach approximates cavities by dendrites and the double - well approach approximates cracks by cavities .",
    "the double - well approach looks more stable with respect to noise , is slightly less sensitive with respect to the adjustment of the phase - field parameter @xmath38 and usually needs less iterations for convergence .",
    "this may be in accordance with the theory , in fact for the double - well case a convergence analysis is proved , whereas the single - well model we use is a modification of the one for which we have convergence results . finally , it turned out to be important to update the phase - field parameter @xmath38 adaptively during the algorithm . if the parameter @xmath38 is chosen too small initially or decreased too fast , sharp interfaces develop too early , sometimes at incorrect locations , and the algorithm is not able to move well established interfaces to other locations .",
    "on the other hand , if the parameter @xmath38 is decreased too much , the term containing the potential might prevail and not well established defects , usually the smaller ones , may disappear .",
