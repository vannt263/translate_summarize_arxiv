    "one of the most important observations in high energy collisions is the @xmath0 spectra for different species of final state particles . from the spectra , we can learn a lot about the regularities of the particle productions .",
    "in many studies , searching for a scaling behaviour of the @xmath0 spectra is helpful to reveal these regularities . in @xcite , the authors showed a scaling behaviour in the pion @xmath0 spectra with different collision centralities at midrapidity in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "this scaling behaviour was extended to noncentral regions in au+au and d+au collisions @xcite .",
    "similar scaling behaviours were found in the proton and anti - proton @xmath0 spectra with different collision centralities at midrapidity in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "recently , we observed a scaling behaviour in the @xmath0 spectra of inclusive charged hadrons in proton - proton ( proton - antiproton ) collisions at @xmath2 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 ( 0.63 , 1.8 and 1.96 ) tev when a linear transformation , @xmath5 , was applied on these spectra @xcite .",
    "here the scaling parameter @xmath4 depends on the collision energy @xmath2 .",
    "this scaling behaviour was explained by the colour string percolation model in a qualitative way . in this paper",
    ", we will extend this scaling behaviour to the @xmath0 spectra of pions , kaons and protons produced in @xmath1 collisions at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev . a new method , the quality factor method @xcite , will be adopted in the searching for the scaling parameter @xmath4 . compared with the method utilized in @xcite , this method does not rely on the shape of the scaling function ,",
    "thus it is more robust .",
    "we will argue that the pions , kaons and protons originate from different distributions of clusters which are formed by strings overlapping , and the colour string percolation model can describe the scaling behaviours of the identified @xmath0 spectra not only in a qualitative way but also in a quantitative way simultaneously . as a similar geometrical scaling behaviour",
    "was suggested when the @xmath0 spectra of identified particles in @xmath1 collisions at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev were presented in terms of a scaling variable @xmath6 , where @xmath7 gev / c and @xmath8 is around 0.27 @xcite , we would like to compare the scaling behaviours presented in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : method ] , we will illustrate the procedure to search for the scaling behaviours in the @xmath0 spectra of identified particles . in section [ sec : scaling_behaviour ] , the scaling behaviours of pions , kaons and protons will be described .",
    "section [ sec : comp ] shows the comparison between the scaling behaviours presented in the variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in section [ sec : mechanism ] , we will use the colour string percolation model to explain the scaling behaviours of the identified particles in a quantitative way .",
    "finally , the conclusion is made in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as done in @xcite , we will search for the scaling behaviours of the identified pion , kaon and proton @xmath0 spectra with the following steps .",
    "let us take the pion @xmath0 spectra as an example , we define a scaling variable , @xmath11 , and a scaled @xmath0 spectra , @xmath12 . here",
    "the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath13 depend on the collision energy . by choosing proper @xmath4 and @xmath13",
    ", the data points of the pion @xmath0 spectra in @xmath1 collisions at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev will migrate into one curve . as a convention",
    ", we usually set both @xmath4 and @xmath13 of the highest energy collisions to be 1 .",
    "however , the @xmath0 coverages of the pion spectra at 0.9 and 7 tev are much smaller than the coverage at 2.76 tev . in order to make the scaling function @xmath14 to describe the pion spectra in the large @xmath0 region faithfully , we choose both @xmath4 and @xmath13 for the collisions at 2.76 tev as 1 . with different choices of @xmath4 and @xmath13 , the scaling functions @xmath14 are different . in order",
    "to get rid of this arbitrariness , we introduce another scaling variable , @xmath15 , and the corresponding normalized scaling function @xmath16 . here",
    "the ways to search for the scaling behaviours in the @xmath0 spectra of kaons and protons are identical to the one for pions .",
    "in this paper , the @xmath0 spectra of identified pions , kaons and protons in @xmath1 collisions at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev were published by the alice collaboration @xcite . here",
    "the identified pion , kaon and proton @xmath0 spectra refer to the spectra of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the data at 2.76 tev cover a pion @xmath0 range of 0.1 - 20.0 gev / c , which is much wider than the ones at 0.9 and 7 tev , 0.1 - 2.6 gev / c and 0.1 - 3.0 gev / c .",
    "similar results are obtained in the comparison among the kaon or proton @xmath0 ranges at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev . as described in section [",
    "sec : method ] , both the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath13 at 2.76 tev are set as 1 , thus the scaling function @xmath14 is nothing but the @xmath0 spectra of pions , kaons or protons at this energy . in @xcite , @xmath14 is written in the tsallis form , in which the mass effect of the charged hadron is ignored . in this work , since the threshold of the @xmath0 range is 0.1 ( 0.1 and 0.1 ) gev / c at 2.76 tev @xcite , which is below the mass of pions ( kaons and protons ) 0.14 ( 0.494 and 0.938 ) gev / c@xmath21 @xcite , we write the scaling function @xmath14 for pions , kaons or protons with the modified tsallis form @xmath22^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } , \\label{eq : phi_z_pt_spectrum_pp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are free parameters , @xmath26 is the mass of the particle species , and @xmath27 is a measure of the non - extensivity .",
    "these free parameters are given by fitting equation to the @xmath0 spectra of identified species at 2.76 tev with the least @xmath28s method .",
    "the square root of the sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the data points has been taken into account in these fits .",
    "lists the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 as well as their uncertainties returned by the fits .",
    "the last line of this table shows the @xmath29s per degrees of freedom ( dof ) , named reduced @xmath28s , for these fits .",
    ".[tab : id_particles_fit_parameters ] the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the scaling functions @xmath14 for pions , kaons and protons .",
    "the uncertainties quoted are due to the statistical plus systematic errors of the data points added in quadrature .",
    "the last line shows the reduced @xmath28s for the fits on the @xmath0 spectra of identified particles at 2.76 tev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]        upper panel : the scaling behaviour of the pion @xmath0 spectra presented in @xmath9 for @xmath1 collisions at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev .",
    "the solid curve is described by the csp fit in equation with parameters in the second column of .",
    "the data points are taken from @xcite .",
    "lower panel : the @xmath30 distribution as a function of @xmath9 for pions . ]",
    "now we would like to seek for the reason why the csp model can describe the scaling behaviour of the identified @xmath0 spectra . under the transformation @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are invariant .",
    "so the @xmath0 spectra of identified particles in equation are also invariant .",
    "this invariance is the scaling behaviour we are looking for . comparing the @xmath36 transformation in the csp model @xmath37 with the one used to search for",
    "the scaling behaviour @xmath38 , we know that @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath39 . as described in @xcite , @xmath40 , where the average is taken over all clusters for identified particles , thus @xmath4 should be proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "since the degree of string overlap @xmath42 grows with energy , the scaling parameter @xmath4 should also increase with energy .",
    "that s indeed what we see for the identified particles in the third column of .",
    "therefore the csp model can explain the scaling behaviours presented in @xmath9 for pions , kaons and protons separately .",
    "however , the rate of the @xmath4 values increasing with energy for pions is different with the one for kaons or protons .",
    "this could also be explained by the csp model .",
    "as @xmath43 , and the values of @xmath44 are the same for pions ( kaons or protons ) at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev , the ratio between the values of @xmath4 at different energies should be equal to the ratio between the values of @xmath45 at different energies .",
    "@xmath45 is evaluated in terms of the csp model as @xcite @xmath46 the cluster fragmentation functions @xmath47 are the same for pions ( kaons or protons ) at different energies .",
    "however , the cluster s size distributions @xmath34 are different for different particles , which can be seen from the comparison among the @xmath48 values for pions , kaons and protons in . as a result , for different species of particles , the values of @xmath4 change in a different rate with energy . in a summary , the csp model could be utilized to explain the scaling behaviours presented in @xmath9 for the identified particles simultaneously .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the scaling behaviour in the inclusive charged hadron @xmath0 spectra to the spectra of identified particles at 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev .",
    "this scaling behaviour is exhibited when @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath11 .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath4 is determined by the quality factor method , which does not rely on the shape of the scaling function .",
    "we have argued that the pions , kaons and protons originate from different distributions of clusters formed by strings overlapping , and the scaling behaviours of these identified particles could be explained by the colour string percolation model in a quantitative way at the same time .",
