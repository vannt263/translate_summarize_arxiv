    "the observation of neutrino flavour oscillations has provided compelling empirical evidence that ( at least two of ) the neutrinos of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics have nonzero masses  @xcite .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by esa s planck satellite , when combined with data from supernovae light curves and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , put an upper limit on the sum of the sm neutrino masses of  @xcite @xmath1 at the @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "the masses of the sm neutrinos therefore appear to be `` unnaturally '' small compared with those of the other sm fermions .",
    "neutrino masses provide strong evidence for the presence of physics beyond the sm , and it is now widely accepted that the sm should be understood as a `` low - energy '' effective field theory ( eft ) , albeit an incredibly successful and highly predictive one . if we impose conservation of lepton number @xmath3 on the sm eft , neutrinos must be of dirac type and acquire their masses through a coupling to the sm higgs field in the same way as the other sm fermions . in this case , we must stomach around 12 orders of magnitude difference between the top - quark and neutrino yukawa couplings . instead , if we maintain that conservation of lepton number is only accidental at low energies , the sm eft contains a dimension-5 operator  @xcite  the weinberg operator  which violates lepton number by two units .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , this operator , schematically of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the charged - lepton doublet and @xmath6 is the higgs doublet , gives rise to a majorana mass term that is suppressed by the scale of new physics @xmath7 . at tree - level",
    ", the majorana mass term may be mediated by the exchange of heavy right - handed neutrinos ( type i see - saw  @xcite ) , by a scalar triplet ( type ii see - saw  @xcite ) or a fermion @xmath8 triplet ( type iii see - saw  @xcite ) .",
    "see - saw mechanisms are compatible with supersymmetric ultra - violet completions of the sm , and they can be realised naturally within grand unified theories ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gauge - invariant fermion masses may also be generated radiatively at the three - loop level in @xmath9 gauge theories by means of global anomalies mediated by scalar or pseudoscalar fields  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such pseudoscalar fields on manifolds with quantum torsion can lead to chirality - violating , right - handed majorana mass terms generated gravitationally at the two - loop level by analogous anomalous operators  @xcite .",
    "in addition to explaining the smallness of the light neutrino masses , the out - of - equilibrium decay of the heavy right - handed neutrinos in the early universe can play a pivotal role in explaining the observed matter - anti - matter asymmetry in scenarios of leptogenesis  @xcite ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "therein , lepton number violating decays produce an initial excess in lepton number that is converted to a baryon number excess ( @xmath10 ) via the @xmath11-violating sphaleron processes of the standard electroweak theory .",
    "however , as theoretically appealing as the see - saw mechanism may be , the origin of the light neutrino masses is yet to be verified experimentally , and it is therefore prudent to consider alternatives . to this end , we recall that quantum field theories are often constructed with the following three properties in mind :    * locality  ensuring microcausality , i.e.  that the position - space canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) vanish for space - like separations . * lorentz invariance in vacuum . *",
    "hermiticity  guaranteeing real eigenvalues and unitary evolution .",
    "a local , lorentz - invariant theory with an hermitian hamiltonian is necessarily @xmath12-invariant ; this is the celebrated @xmath12 theorem .    by sacrificing locality",
    ", it has been shown that neutrino oscillations can be accommodated through @xmath12-violating dirac mass terms without enlarging the neutrino sector of the sm  @xcite .",
    "fermion masses can also arise dynamically in lorentz - invariance - violating ( liv ) @xmath9 gauge theories , involving higher - order spatial derivatives of the gauge field  @xcite .",
    "such models can emerge in the low - energy limit of quantum gravity theories  @xcite , and flavour - mixing interactions between the fermion and gauge fields may provide an alternative explanation for flavour oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the impact of non - hermitian terms on neutrino oscillations in matter have also been considered  @xcite . in the context of open quantum systems , it has been shown that dissipative effects can give rise to effective neutrino masses , leading to flavour oscillations for initially massless or mass - degenerate neutrinos  @xcite . since dissipative quantum systems can be described by non - hermitian effective hamiltonians , this suggests to consider possible modifications of the neutrino sector in which the constraint of hermiticity is relaxed .",
    "our starting point is the following observation : _ all hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues , but not all matrices with real eigenvalues are hermitian .",
    "_ consider , for example , the complex ( but non - hermitian ) @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "its spectrum is @xmath16 there are three regimes :    * when @xmath17 , we are in the _ unbroken phase _ , and the spectrum of @xmath18 contains two distinct , real eigenvalues @xmath19 . * when @xmath20 , we are in the _ broken phase _ , and the spectrum of @xmath18 comprises a complex - conjugate pair of eigenvalues @xmath21 .",
    "* when @xmath22 , the eigenvalues merge , and we lose an eigenvector .",
    "we have one real eigenvalue @xmath23 , and the matrix @xmath18 is defective , having the jordan normal form @xmath24 at @xmath25 , the eigenvalues exhibit a square - root singularity , and this is known as an _",
    "exceptional point_.    in the context of hamiltonian systems , hermiticity is a sufficient but not necessary condition for obtaining real eigenvalues and unitary evolution .",
    "the latter can instead be guaranteed by the less restrictive and more physical constraint of @xmath0 symmetry , i.e.  symmetry of the hamiltonian under the discrete space - time symmetries of parity ( @xmath26 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "it can then be shown that the evolution is unitary with respect to the positive semi - definite inner product @xmath28 rather than the usual inner product @xmath29  @xcite .",

    "its form is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a coupled system with gain and loss .",

    "the lagrangian contains both an hermitian mass term @xmath41 and an anti - hermitian mass term @xmath42 .",
    "the latter changes sign on hermitian conjugation by virtue of the anti - commuting nature of the gamma matrices , i.e.  @xmath43 . by the usual definitions of the discrete symmetry transformations on fock space , that is the definitions appropriate for a theory with an hermitian hamiltonian ,",

    "we see that the dispersion relation is the same for particles and anti - particles , implying that there is no @xmath12 violation .",
    "the fact that the non - hermitian extension of qed yields identical dispersion relations for particles and anti - particles is indicating that we should construct alternative definitions of the @xmath32 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 transformations that are appropriate to a non - hermitian theory and under which this theory is @xmath32 even , @xmath26 odd and @xmath27 odd  @xcite . under these transformations ,",
    "the theory remains @xmath44 odd , but it is now @xmath12 and @xmath0 even , thereby falling within the category of @xmath0-symmetric quantum field theories .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom for a non - hermitian theory are not related by hermitian ( dirac ) conjugation , and it is for this reason that the correct equation of motion is obtained by varying with respect to @xmath48 and not that obtained by taking the dirac conjugate of the equation of motion found by varying with respect to @xmath49 .    for comparison , in curved space - time , we can generate a similar hermitian and locally @xmath12-violating operator through coupling to the background curvature connection .",

    "@xcite ) that this behaviour persists to all loop orders . for instance , in feynman gauge , the one - loop photon polarisation tensor is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the passarino - veltman scalar form factors  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath85 and the ward - takahashi identity is recovered .",
