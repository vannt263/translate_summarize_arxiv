    "in the past several years , experiments at the two b - factories , babar and belle , and at the tevatron collider , cdf and d0 , have discovered an impressive number of new hadronic states in the mass region of the charmonia  @xcite .",
    "these states generically labelled as @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , however , defy a conventional @xmath17 charmonium interpretation   @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are quite numerous , with some 14 of them discovered by the last count , ranging in mass from the @xmath18 @xmath19 , decaying into @xmath20 , to the @xmath3 @xmath21 , decaying into @xmath22 ( for a recent experimental summary and references , see  @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence for an @xmath23 bound state , @xmath24 having the quantum numbers @xmath3 , first observed by babar in the initial state radiation ( isr ) process @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 scalar state  @xcite .",
    "this was later confirmed by bes  @xcite and belle  @xcite .",
    "these states are the subject of intense phenomenological studies .",
    "three different frameworks have been suggested to accommodate them : ( i ) @xmath28 molecules @xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath29 hybrids @xcite ; and ( iii ) diquark - antidiquark or four quark states  @xcite . of these hypotheses ( i ) and ( iii ) are more popular .",
    "for example , the motivation to explain the state @xmath30 , first observed by belle  @xciteand later confirmed by cdf  @xcite , d0  @xcite and babar  @xcite , as a hadronic molecule is that the mass of this state is very close to the @xmath31 threshold .",
    "hence , in this picture , the binding energy is small implying that these are not compact hadrons , which have typical sizes of @xmath32 fermi .",
    "this makes it unlikely that such a loosely bound state could be produced promptly ( i.e. not from @xmath33 decays , as seen by belle and babar ) in high energy hadron collisions , unless one tailors the wave functions to avoid this conclusion .",
    "in particular , bignamini et al .",
    "@xcite have estimated the prompt production cross section of @xmath34 at the tevatron , assuming it as a @xmath31 hadron molecule .",
    "their upper bound on the cross section @xmath35 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the minimum production cross section from the cdf data  @xcite , disfavouring the molecular interpretation of @xmath19 .",
    "however , a dissenting estimate  @xcite yields a much larger cross section , invoking the charm meson rescatterings .",
    "the case that the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are diquark - antidiquark hadrons , in which the diquark ( antidiquark ) pairs are in colour @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) configuration bound together by the qcd colour forces , has been forcefully made by maiani , polosa and their collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the idea itself that diquarks in this colour configuration can play a fundamental role in hadron spectroscopy is rather old , going back well over thirty years to the suggestions by jaffe  @xcite .",
    "more recently , diquarks were revived by jaffe and wilczek  @xcite in the context of exotic hadron spectroscopy , in particular , pentaquark baryons ( antidiquark - antidiquark - quark ) , which now seem to have receded into oblivion .",
    "however , diquarks as constituents of hadronic matter may ( eventually ) find their rightful place in particle physics . lately , interest in this proposal has re - emerged , with a well - founded theoretical interpretation of the low lying scalar mesons as dominantly diquark - antidiquark states and the ones lying higher in mass in the 1 - 2 gev region as being dominantly @xmath40 mesons  @xcite .",
    "evidence in favour of an attractive diquark ( antidiquark ) @xmath41 channel for the so - called _ good _ diquarks ( colour antitriplet @xmath38 , flavour antisymmetric @xmath42 , spin - singlet positive parity ) in the characterisation of jaffe  @xcite is now also emerging from more than one lattice qcd studies  @xcite for the light quark systems . on the other hand ,",
    "no evidence is found on the lattice for an attractive diquark channel for the so - called _ bad _ diquarks ( i.e. , spin-1 states ) involving light quarks  @xcite .",
    "however , as the effective qcd lagrangian is spin - independent in the heavy quark limit , we anticipate that also the _ bad _ diquarks will be found to be in attractive channel for the @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath0 $ ] diquarks having a charm or a beauty quark .",
    "this implies a huge number of heavy tetraquark states , as we also show here for the hidden @xmath44 tetraquark spectroscopy .",
    "earlier work along these lines has been reported in the literature using relativistic quark models  @xcite and qcd sum rules  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the tetraquark picture in the bottom ( @xmath44 ) sector . in the first part ( section ii ) , we classify these states according to their @xmath45 quantum numbers and calculate the mass spectrum of the diquarks - antidiquarks @xmath0[\\bar{b } \\bar{q}^{\\prime } ] $ ] with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the ground and orbitally excited states by assuming both _ good _ and _ bad _ diquarks . the resulting mass spectrum for the @xmath51 and @xmath52 states having the valence diquark - antidiquark content @xmath0[\\bar{b}\\bar{q}]$ ] , with @xmath53 and @xmath50 , and the mixed ones @xmath54[\\bar{b } \\bar{s}]$ ] ( and charge conjugates ) is shown in fig .  [ fullspectrum ] .",
    "the main focus of this letter is on the @xmath3 states , which are excited @xmath55-wave states . to be specific ,",
    "there are four neutral states @xmath56}^{(n)}$ ] @xmath57 with the quark content @xmath58[\\bar{b}\\bar{u}])$ ] ( which differ in their spin assignments ) and another four @xmath59}^{(n)}$ ] with the quark content @xmath60[\\bar{b}\\bar{d}])$ ] . in the isospin symmetry limit , which is used in calculating the entries in fig .",
    "[ fullspectrum ] , these mass states are degenerate for each @xmath61 .",
    "isospin - breaking introduces a mass splitting and the mass eigenstates called @xmath62}$ ] and @xmath63}$ ] ( for lighter and heavier of the two ) become linear combinations of @xmath56}^{(n)}$ ] and @xmath59}^{(n)}$ ] .",

    "the electromagnetic couplings of the tetraquarks @xmath66}$ ] and @xmath67}$ ] are calculated assuming that the diquarks have point - like couplings with the photon , given by @xmath68}$ ] where @xmath69 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath70 and @xmath71}= + 1/3 $ ] for the @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] diquarks and @xmath71}=-2/3 $ ] for the @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] diquarks . because of this charge assignment , electromagnetic couplings of the tetraquarks @xmath66}$ ] and @xmath67}$ ] will depend on the mixing angle @xmath65 ( section iii ) .    to calculate the production cross sections @xmath75 }",

    "are p - wave states , and we need the derivative of the corresponding wave functions at the origin , @xmath84 . to take into account the possibly larger hadronic size of the tetraquarks compared to that of the @xmath44 mesons ,",
    "we modify the quarkonia potential , usually taken as a sum of linear ( confining ) and coulombic ( short - distance ) parts .",
    "for example , the buchmller - tye @xmath85 potential  @xcite has the asymptotic forms @xmath86 ( for @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 ( for @xmath89 ) , where @xmath90 is the string tension and @xmath91 is the qcd scale parameter . the bound state tetraquark potential @xmath92 and @xmath93 to denote a generic diquark and antidiquark , respectively .",
    "however , where the flavour content of the diquark is to be specified , we use the symbol @xmath0 $ ] , and @xmath94 $ ] with @xmath95 .",
    "] will differ from the quarkonia potential @xmath96 in the linear part , as the string tension in a diquark @xmath97 is expected to be different than the corresponding string tension @xmath90 in the @xmath85 mesons , but as the diquarks - antidiquarks in the tetraquarks and the quarks - antiquarks in the mesons are in the same ( @xmath98 ) colour configuration , the coulomb ( short - distance ) parts of the potentials will be similar . defining @xmath99 , we expect @xmath100 to have a value in the range @xmath101 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath100 different from unity will modify the tetraquark wave functions @xmath102 from the corresponding ones of the bound @xmath44 systems , effecting the leptonic decay widths of the tetraquarks .",
    "hadronic decays of @xmath66}$ ] and @xmath67}$ ] are calculated by relating them to the corresponding decays of the @xmath103 , such as @xmath104 , which we take from the pdg .",
    "we assume that the form factors in the two set of decays @xmath105}$ ] and @xmath7 ) are related by @xmath100 , yielding the hadronic decay widths ( section iv ) .",
    "having specified the mass spectrum and our dynamical assumptions for the tetraquark decays , we undertake a theoretical analysis of the existing data from babar  @xcite on @xmath106 , obtained during an energy scan of the @xmath4 cross section in the range of @xmath5 to 11.20 gev . the question that we ask and try to partially answer",
    "is : are the kinematically allowed tetraquark states @xmath63}$ ] and @xmath62}$ ] visible in the babar energy scan of @xmath11 ? to that end , we calculate the contributions of the lowest @xmath107 tetraquark states @xmath108}$ ] and @xmath109}$ ] to the hadronic cross sections @xmath110 } \\to \\;{\\rm hadrons})$ ] and @xmath111 } \\to \\:{\\rm hadrons})$ ] , and hence the corresponding contributions @xmath112.}$ ] and @xmath113}$ ] without the superscript for ease of writing . ]",
    "our fits of the babar @xmath11-data are consistent with the presence of a single state @xmath1}$ ] as a breit - wigner resonance with the mass around @xmath114  gev and a width of about @xmath115 mev , in addition to the @xmath103 and @xmath8 .",
    "the quality of the fit with three breit - wigners is found to be better than the one obtained with just 2 ( i.e. , with @xmath103 and @xmath8 ) , as reported by babar  @xcite ( section v ) .",
    "a closeup of the energy region around 10.90  gev is necessary to confirm and resolve the structure reported by us , as the isospin - induced mass difference between the two eigenstates @xmath108}$ ] and @xmath109}$ ] comes out as about 6 mev , which is comparable to the babar centre - of - mass energy step of 5 mev .",
    "we hope that this can be investigated in the near future by belle .",
    "we tentatively identify the state @xmath1}(10900)$ ] with the state @xmath12 measured in the process @xmath116",
    "an analysis  @xcite of the belle data on the decay widths @xmath117 , dipion invariant mass spectra and the helicity angular distributions is in agreement with the tetraquark interpretation presented here .",
    "the mass spectrum of tetraquarks @xmath0[\\overline{bq^{\\prime } ] } $ ] with @xmath118 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be described in terms of the constituent diquark masses , @xmath119 , spin - spin interactions inside the single diquark , spin - spin interaction between quark and antiquark belonging to two diquarks , spin - orbit , and purely orbital term @xcite , i.e. @xmath120where:@xmath121 ,   \\notag \\\\ h_{ss}^{({\\cal q}\\bar{{\\cal q}}\\mathcal { ) } } & = & 2(\\mathcal{k}_{b\\bar{q}})(\\mathbf{s}_{b}\\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{\\bar{q}}+\\mathbf{s}_{\\bar{b}}\\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{q})+2\\mathcal{k}_{b\\bar{b}}(\\mathbf{s}_{b}\\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{\\bar{b}})+2\\mathcal{k}_{q\\bar{q}}(\\mathbf{s}_{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{\\bar{q } } ) ,   \\notag \\\\",
