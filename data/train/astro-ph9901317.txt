    "after the first stellar x - ray flares were discovered less than 25 years ago on dme stars ( @xcite ) it took almost another decade until the _ einstein observatory _ ( _ eo _ ) detected similar events on young t tauri stars ( tts ) ( @xcite ) . nowadays ,",
    "x - ray flares are known to be entertained on stars all over the h - r diagram ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the timescales and energetics involved in flare events on different types of stars vary strongly consistent with the observation that the level of x - ray activity decays with age .",
    "tts are late - type pre - main sequence stars with typical age of @xmath0yrs and rank among the most active young stars : energy outputs of up to @xmath1 times the maximum x - ray emission observed from solar flares have been reported from tts outbursts .",
    "some of the largest x - ray flares ever observed were discovered by _",
    "rosat _ on the tts lh@xmath2  92 and p1724 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy released in these events ( @xmath3 ) exceeds that of typical tts flares by two orders or magnitude . before the detection of these giant events , the record of x - ray luminosity",
    "was held for more than 10years by the tts rox-20 , where @xmath4 were measured during an _ eo _ observation in february 1981 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a superflare from the optically invisible infrared class  i protostar ylw15 in @xmath5 oph was presented by , with the intrinsic x - ray luminosity over the whole energy range being @xmath6 to @xmath7erg / s , depending on the foreground absorption which is known to lie somewhere between 20 and 40 mag .    although no model has been found yet that explains all aspects of flaring activity , the basic picture of all flare scenarios is  in analogy to the sun  that of dynamo driven magnetic field loops that confine a hot , optically thin , x - ray emitting plasma ( see @xcite for a summary of flare phenomena ) .",
    "quasi - static cooling of such coronal loops has been described by .",
    "an analysis of single flare events is of interest to determine physical parameters of the flaring region such as time scales , energies , temperature and plasma density , and ultimately decide whether coronal x - ray emission of tts is scaled - up solar activity , or whether interaction between the star and either a circumstellar disk or a close binary companion are partly responsible for the x - ray emission .    in this paper",
    "we select a sample of four x - ray observations ( three of tts and one of algol ) which are in conflict with the standard modeling of the lightcurve as either a flare characterised by a quick rise and subsequent exponential decay or as simple sine - like rotational modulation of the quiescent emission . in the latter case x - ray emission",
    "would be larger when the more x - ray luminous area is on the front side of the star ( directed towards the observer ) .",
    "such kind of rotationally modulated emission was observed in the tts sr12 in @xmath5 oph by .",
    "we propose that the untypical shape of the x - ray lightcurves we present is due to a flare event modulated by the rotation of the star .",
    "suggested rotational occultation of an x - ray flare to explain the broad maximum and slow decay of a flare on v773tau observed by _",
    "asca_. while they model their data by fitting a sine function to the lightcurve without allowing for an exponential decay phase ( similar to @xcite ) , we start out from a decaying flare and modify it by a time varying volume factor . by this approach",
    "we take into consideration that the flare might be occulted by the star during part of the observation and we are able to estimate the decay timescale of the lightcurve @xmath8 and the size of the emitting loop .",
    "such a model was first suggested by , and classified the corresponding flare event as ` anomalous ' .",
    "a rotationally modulated flare was also mentioned as possible interpretation of a flare - like event in p1724 ( @xcite ) , shown in our fig .",

    "was discovered to be a binary system ( @xcite ) with @xmath12 separation , which remains unresolved in the pspc observation of 1991 september 07/08 we present here .",
    "the period of sr13 is unknown .",

    "_ ginga _ observed a large flare from the algol system ( presumably algol b ; @xcite ) .",
    "the shape of the algol lightcurve resembles that of the tts flares discussed before .",
    "therefore , we decided to include this observation in our sample , although the algol system represents a different class of flare stars .",
    "we use the extended scientific software analysis system ( exsas , @xcite ) to analyse the two _ rosat _ observations , which were obtained from the _ rosat _ public data archive . to take account of possible time variations in the background ,",
    "the background count rate was computed for each satellite orbit and subtracted accordingly from the measured lightcurve . _",
    "ginga _ data were kindly supplied to us in computer readable format by bob stern , while steve skinner provided us the _ asca _ lightcurve of v773tau .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve during a flare event is commonly described by a steep , linear rise followed by an exponential decay .",
    "the e - folding time @xmath8 of the decay varies greatly between several minutes to hours depending on the nature of the flaring star .",
    "disagreement prevails on the question whether the apparent quiescent emission might be attributed to continuous , unresolved short timescale activity .",
    "the detection of a high temperature spectral component in the quiescent spectrum might hint at such low - level flaring ( @xcite ) .",
    "several flares have been observed that do not match the typical appearance : instead of displaying a sharp peak , the lightcurves of this type of events are characterized by smooth variations around maximum emission that sometimes goes along with a slower rise as compared to standard flare events . in these cases the shape of the lightcurve can be reproduced by taking account of the rotation of the star .",
    "flares that erupt on the backside of the star become visible only gradually as the star rotates and drags the plasma loop around .",
    "the visible flare volume is thus a function of time which modulates the exponential decay .",
    "the scenario we have in mind , and that we will refer to as the ` rotating flare model ' henceforth , is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .    for simplicity",
    "the emitting plasma loop is approximated by a sphere anchored on the star s surface .",
    "the fraction of the loop volume which is visible to the observer is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radius of the star and @xmath23 the radius of the spherical plasma loop .",
    "the time dependency of @xmath24 is hidden in @xmath2 , the angle between the current position of the flaring volume and the position where a flare just begins to become occulted by the star .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : vol ] ) does not hold for rotational phases during which the flaring volume is either completely behind ( @xmath25 ) or completely in front of the star ( @xmath26 $ ] ) .",
    "the time dependency of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vol ] ) depends on whether the loop is disappearing or reappearing and is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the critical phase at which the plasma volume has just disappeared .",
    "( [ eq : vol ] ) is not valid any more until the loop reaches phase @xmath29 and begins to move into the line of sight again .",
    "@xmath28 is a function of the relative size of the radius of the flaring volume and the radius of the star , @xmath30 .",
    "the visible fraction of the plasma volume as a function of time is plotted for different values of the radius ratio @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vol ] .",
    "our model is based on several simplifying assumptions concerning the flare geometry .",
    "first , we imply that we look directly onto the rotational plane , i. e. @xmath32 , and that the flare takes place at low latitudes .",
    "flares that erupt in polar regions , in contrast , in the configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] would remain partially visible during the whole rotation period .",
    "furtheron , eq.([eq : vol ] ) does not take account of the curvature of the star .",
    "we content ourselves with these approximations because , given the present quality of the data , further sophistication of the model seems to be unnecessary .    making use of the configuration described above , for a flare which is observed while the flaring region turns up from the backside of the star",
    ", the x - ray lightcurve can be modeled by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the quiescent x - ray count rate of the star , @xmath35 the strength of the outburst , @xmath8 the decay timescale of the count rate and @xmath36 the visible fraction of the volume of the plasma loop given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vol ] ) for values of @xmath2 within the allowed range , and by 0 or 1 for angles @xmath2 outside the intervals of eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .    the hump - like shape of the lightcurves we will discuss in the next section can be reproduced if the visible volume @xmath24 _ increases _ during the first _ observed _ part of the flare , ie .",
    "three critical moments determine the rotating flare event : the time of outburst , the time when the flare region passes phase @xmath38 and begins to move into the line of sight , and the time at which the observation started . in the next paragraphs",
    "the relation between these times will be examined .",
    "first , an offset between flare outburst and the time when it becomes visible to an observer ( at @xmath38 ) might be present , when the flare takes place on the occulted side of the star . in our model such a time offset @xmath39 contributes only to the normalization of the exponential @xmath40 and can not be separated from the intrinsic brightness @xmath41 of the outburst .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath39 is given by @xmath42 since for larger time offsets the flare would have been observed also at @xmath43 , that is before its occultation .",
    "given the rotational periods of several days , @xmath44 exceeds the typical decay timescale for tts flares ( of a few hours ) .",
    "however , from an observational point of view it is impossible to exclude that the flares occurred already before they rotated away , because data extending over several hours before the reappearance of the flare are not available for the lightcurves analysed here , except in the case of algol .",
    "indeed , at first glance the combination of the two phases of enhanced count rate in the algol observation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : theolcs]a ) looks similar to what is expected to be seen from _ one _ very long flare that disappeared behind the star shortly after outburst and reappeared half a rotational cycle later still displaying a strong count rate enhancement .",
    "figure  [ fig : theolcs]b gives an example of a theoretical lightcurve for a flare which is occulted right after its outburst and whose duration is more than half the rotation period .",
    "however , our attempt to model the complete algol lightcurve from fig .",
    "[ fig : theolcs]a by such a single temporary occulted flare was not successful because the model restrictions concerning the relative strength of the pre- and post - occultation part of the flare are not met by the algol lightcurve .",
    "thus we can rule out offsets larger than @xmath44 for the algol observation discussed in this paper , and the short rise in count rate observed before the large flare must be due to an independent event .",
    "second , the start of the observation of a flare event , which is characterised by a beginning enhancement of the observed count rate , can differ from the time at which the outer edge of the plasma loop emerges from the back of the star due to gaps in the data stream .",
    "so , strictly speaking , another offset @xmath45 has to be included when fitting the ` rotating flare model ' to the data to take account of a possible delay of the observation with respect to flare phase @xmath38 .",
    "such an additional parameter that allows to determine the rotational phase of the flare region at the beginning of the observed rise is needed to obtain acceptable fits for the flares on algol and v773tau .",
    "for the _ rosat _ observations ( of sr13 and p1724 ) , however , an offset @xmath45 does not improve the fit due to the low statistics of the data .",
    "we note here , that the observed flare rise is only _ apparent _ according to our model : the star is assumed to have flared ( and thus exhibited its maximum emission ) well before the _ observed _ maximum , and the count rate is low at that time only due to the fact that the flaring volume has not yet become visible .",
    "the enhanced x - ray emission during flare events is produced by a hot plasma which has been heated to temperatures of @xmath46 and above .",
    "optically thin plasma models show , when applied to spectra representing different stages of the flare , that after the outburst the temperature drops exponentially to the quiescent level . the temperature observed for a rotationally modulated flare",
    "should thus be highest during the phase where the flare emerges from the backside of the star when the observed lightcurve has not yet reached its maximum .",
    "the emission measure , on the other hand , being a volume related parameter is expected to show a time evolution similar to the lightcurve .",
    "we fit the model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) to that part of the lightcurves from the observations introduced in sect .",
    "[ sect : data ] that are by visual inspection identified with the outburst due to their enhanced count rates . except for v773tau ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fit_v773tau ] ) none of these lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : theolcs](c ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_sr13 ] , and fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_p1724 ] ) can be explained by simple sine - like variations due to rotational modulation of the quiescent emission .",
    "there is always an additional feature present , namely a flare .",
    "the lightcurves discussed here are characterised by a concave shape of the ( e - folding ) decay phase typical for flares ( whether or not rotationally modulated ) , while a simple sine - like rotational modulation of quiescent emission always produces a convex shape in the decay part .    in all cases we examined ,",
    "the quiescent count rate is held fixed on its average pre - flare value .",
    "thus , three free parameters have to be adjusted to the data : the strength of the flare , @xmath35 in cts / s , the decay timescale of the lightcurve , @xmath8 , and the radius @xmath23 of the flaring volume relative to the stellar radius , @xmath22 .",
    "an additional freedom allowing for an offset @xmath45 between rotational phase @xmath38 of the flare and the _ apparent _ outburst of the flare , which is observed as a rise in count rate , is used for the modeling of the _ ginga _ ( algol ) and _ asca _ ( v773tau )",
    "lightcurves ( see the explanation in the previous section ) .",

    "we assume synchronous rotation .",

    "[ sect : model ] ) .",

    "are well represented by the model . although this value of @xmath83 is still far from representing an excellent fit , the ability of the model to reproduce the overall shape of the x - ray lightcurve is convincing .",

[ fig : em ]",
    "can thus be extrapolated to the previous part of the observation to find the values for the emission measure intrinsic to this flare event .",
    "the observed emission measure during the rotationally dominated beginning of the flare is then fairly well reproduced by correcting the extrapolated values for the time dependence of the volume ( @xmath89 ) , where we neglect possible variations of the plasma density @xmath90 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the observation , the actual emission measure of the flare event is highest at the onset of the flare at @xmath91 and it decays simultaneously with the count rate ( @xmath92 ) due to a decrease of @xmath90 or shrinking loop volume .",
    "the good agreement between the emission measure observed by and the values expected from our model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : em ] ) provide convincing evidence that the application of the ` rotating - flare model ' is justified for this flare .",
    "the development of the temperature during the flare ( see @xcite ) does not show the characteristic hump shape , but is close to a pure exponential decay as expected for volume unrelated parameters .",

    "we note that the data is slightly bended towards the time axis around the 6th data interval after the start of the observation .",
    "this behavior , producing an overall ` convex ' shape of the x - ray lightcurve , could be due to an additional feature on the surface of the star .",
    "we suggest that a localized region with enhanced x - ray emission can be responsible for this break if this region disappears due to the star s rotation at @xmath103 . for comparison",
    "we show a fit of our ` rotating flare model ' where such a feature has been included ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_v773tau ] , @xmath104 for @xmath102 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "since we are interested in a qualitative description of the shape of the lightcurve only we assumed that this region makes up for 0.2cps during its visibility and begins to disappear gradually at jd 2449977.85 . representing this x - ray emitter by another set of _ free _ parameters",
    "would certainly further improve the already good agreement between data and model .    also present the time behavior of the emission measure derived from a two - temperature fit to the _ asca _ spectrum .",
    "if our interpretation of adding a soft x - ray spot , which gradually rotates away , is correct , then the emission measure of the soft component should stay constant for most of the time , but decrease towards the end of the observation .",
    "however , the s / n of the time - sliced spectral fits ( @xcite , his fig .  10 , middle panel ) is not sufficient to judge whether this is indeed the case .    to conclude , other interpretations such as a different kind of anomalous flaring can not be excluded from the data of this observation .",
    "have presented another _",
    "asca _ flare observation of v773tau . in that observation v773tau shows the typical flare behavior in the sense of a sharp rise and a subsequent longer decay of count rate , temperature , and emission measure .",
    "however , their attempt to fit an e - folding decay to the lightcurve of the hard x - ray count rate was not successful the count rate remaining too high towards the end of the observation .",
    "hence , unusually long decays seem to be characteristic for v773tau .",
    "we have presented a sample of four untypical flare events and provided a common explanation : parameters that depend on the size of the emitting plasma volume ( e. g. count rate , @xmath86 ) deviate from the standard exponential decay behavior due to temporary occultation of the flaring volume by the rotating star .",
    "this is most evident from the large flare on algol , for which the data are most abundant and our modeling is therefore most reliable .",
    "the comparatively slow rise of the count rate in the x - ray lightcurve , broad maxima and following exponential decay are well represented by a model that describes emission from a spherical plasma loop that emerges from the back of the star and gradually rotates into the line of sight of the observer .",
    "the increasing visible fraction of the loop produces the flat maximum and apparent slow - down of the rise stage .    in our data",
    "there is no indication for sine - like modulation of the x - ray lightcurve , since all but one of the lightcurves are clearly asymmetric , and the duration of all events is well below the rotational period of the host star .",
    "the only exception is the flare on v773tau where proposed sinusoidal modulation to reproduce the shape of the _ asca _ lightcurve .",
    "we suggest a different explanation involving a second x - ray emitting region on the star additionally to a rotationally modulated flare to come up for the ` convex ' shape of the lightcurve",
    ". however , due to the lack of pre - flare data , no conclusive evidence is present for either of the interpretations .",
    "evidence for reheating of the plasma at @xmath105 inferred from the increase of the hardness ratio ( see @xcite ) does not contradict our model , but could be related to the disappearing of a region emitting soft x - rays similar to the one we introduce .",
    "no significant change in temperature nor emission measure of the soft component was observed in skinner s spectral analysis , but we note that the results of spectral fitting depend on the assumption for the abundances and column density .    the decay timescales @xmath8 found from our best fit to the respective flare event are all in the typical range for tts flares ( of a few hours ) except for v773tau , where the flare lasted extraordinary long ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "comparatively large loop sizes of a considerable fraction of the radius of the star are obtained for all observations analysed here , @xmath23 spanning between 10 to 65% of the star radius .",
    "these values are in agreement with typical loop sizes for tts flares inferred from quasi - static loop modeling ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    in view of the large relative size of the ratio between loop and star radius the assumptions we explain in sect .",
    "[ sect : model ] concerning our model for a rotating flare might seem somewhat oversimplifying .",
    "we also note that different solutions of the model seem to describe the data equally well even in the case of the well restrained algol observation .",
    "therefore , uncertainties in the fit parameters are to be regarded carefully",
    ". however , the qualitative description of the scenario is very good and the data are well represented by the model .",
    "other interpretations of the ` anomalous ' flare events we presented in this paper may not be excluded but are still to be traced .",
    "clearly , continuous observations of whole flares are needed to verify whether an event could be subject to rotational modulation of the kind we discussed in this paper . up to date",
    "most of the flares observed lack completeness in that either the rise or part of the decay were missed by the observation . in the near future _ xmm _ will provide the possibility of long , uninterrupted observations ( up to @xmath107h ) that will enable to pursue the development of flares in whole .",
    "better statistics are needed to be able to study the time development of spectral parameters for tts flares , and try to confirm the ` rotating flare model ' by use of the spectral information similar to our analysis of the algol observation .",
