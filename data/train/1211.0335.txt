    "the theoretical results of atomic parity non - conservation ( pnc ) when combined with the experimental results is an important probe of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics @xcite .",
    "there are two sources of pnc in atoms , nuclear spin - independent ( nsi ) and nuclear spin - dependent ( nsd ) .",
    "the nsi - pnc is well studied and experimentally observed in several atoms .",
    "the most precise measurement till date is in the case of atomic cs @xcite . the same experiment also indicated a signature of nsd - pnc effects .",
    "the most dominant source of which is the nuclear anapole moment ( nam ) , a parity odd nuclear electromagnetic moment arising from parity violating interaction within the nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , there are two other contributions to nsd - pnc , these are the nsd electron - nucleus @xmath3 exchange interaction and the combined effect of hyperfine interaction and nsi electron - nucleus @xmath3 exchange interaction .    the parameters describing nucleon - nucleon coupling , effect of nam is subsumed into it , extracted from the cs pnc experiment do not concur with the nuclear data @xcite .",
    "this certainly calls for the further investigation of the nsd - pnc effects in other atomic systems as well .",
    "an example of an alternative experiment is the proposal to measure the pnc in ba@xmath2 ion , suggested by fortson @xcite and is in progress at seattle @xcite .",
    "this experiment could lead to an unambiguous observation of nam in the @xmath4 transition , as the nsi - pnc alone does not contribute to this transition .",
    "it is important to note that the major difficulty to a clear observation of nam is the large nsi signal , which overwhelms the nsd signature .",
    "the ra@xmath2 ion has also been suggested and is considered to be an important candidate for the pnc measurement @xcite .",
    "apart from ba@xmath2 and ra@xmath2 ions which are one - valence systems the other promising candidate for pnc , the nam in particular , measurement is the atomic yb .",
    "an enhanced effect of pnc has already been reported @xcite in neutral yb , the @xmath5 transition , and for further refinement of the experiment is in progress at berkeley .",
    "the @xmath6 transition in yb@xmath2 , has also been suggested to reveal the nam signature and is being investigated at los alamos @xcite .",
    "the atomic theory results using reliable and accurate many - body methods are key to estimate the expected value of pnc transition amplitudes and extracting nam . for the theoretical calculations , the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) theory @xcite can be of great significance , as it is one of the most reliable many - body theory to incorporate electron correlation in atomic calculations .",
    "the rcc has been used extensively in atomic structure calculations @xcite of properties like transition energies , hyperfine structure constants , electromagnetic transition amplitudes , intrinsic electric dipole moment and pnc in atoms . apart from atomic physics",
    ", it has also been used with great success in nuclear @xcite , molecular @xcite and the condensed matter @xcite physics .    in this work ,",
    "we employ perturbed relativistic coupled - cluster ( prcc ) theory to calculate nsi and nsd - pnc amplitudes of the @xmath06s\\;^2s_{1/2}-[4f^{14}]5d\\;^2d_{3/2}$ ] transition in the case of @xmath1yb@xmath2 ion .",

    "[ e1pnc_tab ]      to calculate the uncertainty of our e1pnc results we resort to a analysis based on the sum - over - state approach . in this method , the net uncertainty associated with an intermediate state is @xmath289 where @xmath290 and @xmath291 are the deviations of excitation energy and e1 matrix element form the experimental data . and these are calculated based on results presented in tables .",
    "[ ee_tab ] and [ e1_tab ] , respectively . for @xmath292 , uncertainty associated with @xmath43 matrix , we resort to the deviation of @xmath293 from experimental data , where @xmath294 and @xmath295 represent the magnetic dipole hyperfine constants of initial and final states of the e1pnc transition .    as discussed earlier , dominant contribution",
    "to nsi - pnc is from the @xmath170 state , which contributes through @xmath159 i.e. @xmath43 matrix element @xmath296 , @xmath297 matrix @xmath298 and energy denominator @xmath299 .",
    "the uncertainty associated with @xmath43 matrix element , we get using our rcc results for hyperfine constants , is 9.1% . and",
    ", the relative uncertainty of @xmath297 matrix element and the energy denominator are calculated as 5.7% and 3.4% , respectively .",
    "combining these , the net uncertainty in nsi - pnc result is 18.2% .    for nsd - pnc",
    "as well @xmath170 is the dominant contributing state . however in this case unlike nsi - pnc , apart from @xmath159 , contribution through @xmath161 is not negligible .",
    "the matrix elements involve in this case are @xmath300 and @xmath301 , and the energy denominator is @xmath302 .",
    "using the similar analysis we get 4.52% , 11.26% and 2.41% , respectively for @xmath292 , @xmath291 and @xmath303 . combining these , we get 18.19% as the net uncertainty associated with term @xmath161 .",
    "the @xmath304 relative uncertainty in nsd - pnc results are then 18.17% .",
    "in this work , we present nsi and nsd - pnc transition amplitudes for the @xmath06s^2\\;s_{1/2 } - [ 4f^{14}]5d^2\\;d_{3/2}$ ] transition in @xmath1yb@xmath2 ion . to estimate the uncertainty of the the pnc results , we also calculate excitation energies , hyperfine structure constants and e1 transition amplitudes for some of the important low lying states , using rcc theory .",
    "the e1pnc results are computed using prcc theory , which is formulated based on rcc theory and it incorporates electron correlation effects arising from a class of diagrams to all order in the presence of pnc interaction as a perturbation .",
    "our results for excitation energies , hyperfine structure constants and e1 transition amplitudes are in good agreement , in some cases better , with the previous experimental data .",
    "our nsi - pnc result lies between the results from two previous studies reported in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nsd - pnc df results from our work is in excellent agreement with the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for all hyperfine transitions .",
    "the total nsd - pnc result for the @xmath157 hyperfine transition lies between the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite . for the remaining two , our results are slightly on the higher side .",
    "the upper bound to the theoretical uncertainty associated with e1pnc results is about 20% .",
