    "an increasing amount of observational evidence supports the notion that the early universe has undergone an epoch of inflation",
    ". however we are still far from understanding the underlying assumptions and resolving some of its most crucial issues .",
    "one of the open questions about inflation is the entropy problem@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite : why did the universe start from an extremely low entropy initial state that in turn can later give rise to the arrow of time in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics ?",
    "thermodynamic arrow tells us that a system will evolve towards the increase of entropy , which simply states that a system is more likely to evolve from a state with low occurrence probability to that with a higher probability .",
    "since the universe is old , in order to explain the thermodynamic arrow of time the entropy in the early universe must therefore be extremely small , which requires a special initial condition .",
    "on the other hand , the standard inflation paradigm assumes the initial condition of the universe to be realized generically .",
    "this conflict @xcite becomes more acute if we regard the initial entropy as the probability for spontaneous formation of a homogeneous domain in the inflationary universe .",
    "an extremely low initial entropy required by the thermodynamic arrow then suggests that the initial universe only has a very small probability to evolve into the current universe through inflation .",
    "several solutions have been suggested in the literature .",
    "one approach is the spontaneous eternal inflation @xcite@xcite , where inflation is assumed to occur both forward and backward in time .",
    "another is the so - called bubble cosmology@xcite , where universes were induced as a realization of string landscape@xcite@xcite@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we seek a solution to the entropy problem within the present framework of the standard model of cosmology without relying on assumptions like symmetric time arrows or string theory .",
    "the framework will only be effective , in that new physics is expected to occur near the initial singularity predicted by general relativity , and detailed mechanism for the transition from inflation to a radiation - dominated universe is still not well - understood .",
    "our aim is to establish the following three stages of entropy development in the very beginning of the universe :    1 .",
    "inflation occurred with a probability that is higher than what is commonly believed .",
    "subsequently a lower entropy state is dynamically induced by inflation itself .",
    "a large amount of entropy is generated after it reaches a minimum during inflation .",
    "note that an important subtlety related to the second stage is that the drastic expansion at the very beginning of the universe is a highly non - equilibrium process .",
    "therefore the usual thermodynamical laws do not necessary hold .",
    "the thermodynamic arrow of time is meaningful only after some time span when we come to the third stage , only by then do we have the entropy problem to concern with .",
    "the possibility of this scenario has long been refuted at stage 1 in the previous literature @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite based on the argument that inflation itself requires an extremely special initial condition to occur .",
    "however , we hold the point of view that whether the initial condition is special or not depends largely on how one measures the probability of the degrees of freedom . for example , in the recent development of loop quantum cosmology @xcite it was found rather differently that the probability for inflation to happen is much higher using their measure",
    ". we should like to point out an important fact , which was overlooked by those previous authors , that _ inflation is accompanied with a horizon_. therefore the correct measure of the probability for inflation should be given by quantum _",
    "entanglement entropy_. since the presence of the horizon increases the entanglement entropy by the entanglement between the observable and the unobservable regions , inflation should have a higher probability to occur .",
    "this insight motivates us to seek new dynamical solution to the entropy problem within the inflation paradigm .",
    "we notice that in the literature there are examples of decreasing entanglement entropy @xcite@xcite due to the situation where the system is out of equilibrium or simply from long - range quantum correlation .",
    "in particular , a decrease of tripartite entropy after inflation is shown in @xcite , which inspires us to consider the evolution of bipartite entropy from quantum entanglement .",
    "indeed , in a recent effort by two of the present authors ( pc & yn ) @xcite , it was found that a minimum of the entanglement entropy induced from the entanglement between cosmological perturbations is reached at an early stage of the inflation .",
    "the calculation made there , however , was classical .",
    "since we expect quantum effects to be prominent in the beginning of the universe , each degree of freedom must subject to quantum fluctuations .",
    "we therefore re - address the issue properly in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ entropy ]",
    "we briefly summarize the reasons and methods for considering entanglement entropy as entropy budget of early universe , which consist of homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts . in section [ chap ]",
    "we introduce the effective model used in our calculation . detailed treatment and numerical results",
    "are summarized in next two sections [ wdw ] and [ pertsect ] , which together consist of the total contribution to entanglement entropy . to make comparison with the previous result in @xcite , the computation",
    "therein is reproduced in section [ pertsect ] for completeness .",
    "results in each section are discussed , and possible physical origins of the entropy decrease are presented in section [ sec : explain ] . the main conclusion is summarized in the last section .",
    "in the present framework , most conventional considerations of entropy are thermal , statistical and entanglement entropy accounted by von neumann . since early universe experienced accelerated expansion , it is far out of equilibrium , and thermal entropy is ill - defined for lack of a universal temperature .",
    "statistical mechanics is also not directly applicable on present situation due to long - range nature of gravitational force .    on the other hand , von neumann entropy from quantum entanglement",
    "is perfectly well - defined in non - equilibrium system , and can cope with problems statistical entropy encounters in gravitational systems like loss of information .",
    "moreover , von neumann entropy fits into unitary framework of entire universe in that it measures information encoded in entanglement between subsystems , while thermal entropy is of dissipation nature .",
    "since the early universe can be described as a quantum system without strong decoherence , it is justifiable to invoke von neumann entropy to find the evolution of total entropy of the universe .",
    "we will thus use the quantum entanglement entropy instead of thermal entropy in the following discussion to help clarify our setup and to quantify the amount of information in a quantum system .    here",
    "we will clarify what we mean by von neumann entanglement entropy .",
    "entanglement entropy of von neumann measures the degree of bipartite entanglement , and thus depends on partitions of the system .",
    "multipartite entanglement entropy thus seems necessary in order to characterize total entanglement entropy of a system ; however , the method is difficult to applied on general systems @xcite .",
    "we suggest one reasonable way to quantify the total entanglement entropy of a quantum system is to sum up von neumann entanglement entropies of all bi - partite subsystems .",
    "since we only concern the entropy change in the evolution , we can subtract a ground value to regularize any potential infinity .",
    "more on regularization will be discussed in later sections .      in the construction of entanglement entropy evolution , there are two contributions arose from two distinctive ways of dividing the universe .",
    "regarding the entire universe as unitary quantum mechanical system consist of observable and unobservable regions , von neumann entropy then measures the quantum entanglement between those two parts of universe due to the evolution of background metric , and is thus a homogeneous contribution . in this unitary",
    "setting von neumann entropy characterizes the probability of different histories , since the total amount of information is kept constant by louville s theorem .",
    "the entanglement entropy is then obtained by the standard wheeler - dewitt formalism , where configurations of fields represent different histories in the path integral sense .",
    "we will discuss homogeneous entropy from particle horizon in more detail in section [ entrophori ] .",
    "the second contribution comes from the entanglement between two opposite momentum sectors of the universe , and is entitled inhomogeneous entanglement entropy . in our model of homogeneous background , it attributes to entanglement of pairwise matter momentum modes , which can be computed by standard cosmological perturbation .",
    "the total inhomogeneous entanglement entropy is then obtained by summing over the entire momentum spectrum .      in this section",
    "our discussion will use frw metric and minisuperspace .",
    "the hilbert space in the accessible and the inaccessible regions are distinguished by the scale factor @xmath0 .",
    "the concept of particle horizon can be most easily illustrated by considering a light path : @xmath1 thus at infinite future the light can travel a coordinate distance @xmath2=\\int_{t_0}^{\\infty } \\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{a(t)}.\\ ] ] it is therefore clear that if the integral eq.([eqn : lightdistance ] ) converges , light can only travel a finite distance , and we have a particle horizon outside this range ; inflation is one such case .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the universe can be obtained by tracing out the hilbert space associated with the inaccessible region beyond the particle horizon , i.e. , the region with radius @xmath3 , with @xmath4 given by eq.([eqn : lightdistance ] ) .",
    "every such radius gives rise to a concentric sphere in this region , which can always be associated with a different scale factor @xmath5 , evolved from @xmath6 , that gives a larger integral than @xmath7 $ ] . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider different time slices along the curves of @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "at each time slice we can choose @xmath9 smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "thus the integral in eq.([eqn : lightdistance ] ) for @xmath5 will be larger than that for @xmath8 , therefore light in this metric can travel beyond @xmath7 $ ] under the original metric @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "we can choose the class @xmath12 to be in one - to - one correspondence with each coordinate distance @xmath13 beyond @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "thus the trace over the hilbert space associated with the inaccessible region is performed over those configurations that belong to this class : @xmath14>r_h[a]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in the language of minisuperspace quantum mechaincs , the trace is then carried out by summing over states with metric degree of freedom @xmath15 .",
    "the detailed calculation is implemented in section [ wdw ] .    before ending the discussion on entanglement entropy",
    ", we should mention that the entanglement entropy of the universe has long been considered in the literature , see e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . for a relativistic quantum field theory in @xmath16-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "the entanglement entropy obtained by partitioning the system into @xmath17 and @xmath18 with a smooth and compact boundary @xmath19 exhibits the following scaling character:@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the typical length of @xmath19 , @xmath22 is some cutoff lattice length , and @xmath23 are some constants @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this relation has been confirmed using weyl anomaly , and the same expression also appears in the correction obtained by generalized uncertainty principle@xcite .",
    "note that the leading divergence of the entanglement entropy from ( [ eqn : ententropyscaling ] ) is proportional to the area of @xmath19 , which is the `` area law '' of entanglement entropy .",
    "in particular , in the presence of horizon the bi - partition can be naturally chosen as inside and outside the horizon , therefore the entanglement entropy should be proportional to the horizon area , which can be regarded as the bekenstein area law ( a more correct statement is that the entanglement entropy should be thought as quantum correction to bekenstein - hawking entropy due to matter field , see @xcite ) .    in our setting the scale @xmath21 is the cosmological scale at the horizon @xmath24 .",
    "let s consider the change of sub - leading term with respect to this cosmological scale : @xmath25 therefore if the sub - leading term is non - negligible , it can generate a decrease in entanglement entropy with respect to the cosmological time @xmath10 .    in section [ arealaw ]",
    "we will show the entanglement entropy calculated by our method agrees with the area law in the semi - classical regeme ; however , at early times the area law will be corrected by quantum fluctuations ( section [ qearlyentropy ] ) .",
    "thus our result suggests an _ ab initio _ confirmation of equation ( [ eqn : ententropyscaling ] ) from canonical quantum gravity .",
    "to track entropy evolution , we find it necessary to specify our setting , so long as it is general enough to characterize the essential features of the evolution of the early universe .",
    "the early universe we are investigating at can be roughly divided into two stages : inflationary and radiation dominated eras . from the requirement of unitarity",
    ", our model must provide smooth transition between those stages .",
    "in addition , we will work in the conventional frw homogeneous background .",
    "an candidate with minimal ad hoc assumptions for our mathematical model is generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) , which can provide a smooth transition via its equation of state . instead of treating gcg as a real substance , we only regard it as an effective description and convenient way to track down entropy evolution .",
    "the details of our model , including parameter space , are discussed in section ( [ model ] ) .",
    "we believe , however , that our result is quite general ; see section ( [ conclusion ] ) .",
    "when applied to cosmology , the chaplygin gas@xcite models the change of cosmic content by regulating the equation of state of the background fluid instead of the form of the potential .",
    "it was first suggested by kamenshchik@xcite in an attempt to smoothly interpolate the de sitter phase and the radiation dominant era without _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",
    "generalized chaplygin gas models ( gcg ) were subsequently suggested@xcite@xcite@xcite , some of which managed to unify dark energy and dark matter@xcite . instead of endowing it as a physical substance , we will only invoke it as an effective description .",
    "the fluid density of gcg is given by@xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are positive constants .",
    "note that in this expression we have implicitly taken a reference scale factor at some point during inflation to be @xmath27 .",
    "one can also manifest this reference scale by rescaling @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "consider the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "observe that when taking the limit @xmath32 , one recovers from eq.([eqn : gcgdensity ] ) the fluid density of de sitter space characterizing the inflation era ; when taking @xmath33 , the fluid density becomes that of a gas in the radiation - dominated era .",
    "thus the two eras can be smoothly patched under this effective description .",
    "the constraints on the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 to realize this scenario will be discussed in section [ parameters ] .    from the conservation of energy",
    "one can deduce the pressure for the chaplygin gas as @xmath36 after eliminating the scale factor @xmath10 , one can obtain the equation of state for generalized chaplygin gas .    one can also model gcg with an underlying minimal coupling scalar field @xmath37 by matching the energy momentum with the fluid described above . denoting the scalar potential by @xmath38 ,",
    "we have : @xmath39 the classical expression for the scalar potential as well as the equation of motion can be immediately obtained by relating @xmath10 and @xmath37 , as in @xcite . for this purpose , we only need the limiting case for the early - time and the late - time approximations , respectively , with the partition roughly coincides with the crossing between the inflation and the radiation - dominated epochs . these are    * early time [ @xmath40 : [ eqn : earlytimeapprox ] @xmath41a^{1/(1+\\gamma)}a_0^{(\\lambda/\\kappa)^2 } e^{-\\lambda ( \\phi-\\phi_0)},\\label{eqn : earlypot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the coupling constant , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "* late time [ @xmath45 : [ eqn : latetimeapprox ] @xmath46      in this subsection we will briefly summarize the constraints on the generalized chaplygin gas ( [ eqn : gcgdensity ] )    first we require that the inflation takes place before radiation dominant era , which amounts to the condition : @xmath47 as @xmath32 . since both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are positive , we have @xmath48 two more conditions should be imposed on @xmath34 and @xmath35 so as to insure that our model does interpolate between an early inflationary phase of the type of quintessence and a subsequent radiation dominant phase .",
    "these are : ( i ) the energy density must induce a period of inflation and ( ii ) the inflation should not cause a super - inflationary expansion ; i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "that is , a super - accelerating phase of the universe , where the energy density grows as the universe expands , should not occur .    by combining these two ansatz with the above inequality ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) ,",
    "we arrive at the following additional constraints : @xmath50 in particular , the last constraint results from the requirement for an inflationary period @xmath51 as @xmath32 , which directly leads to the constraint on the coupling constant of the gcg scalar field ( [ eqn : earlypot ] ) , @xmath52 it is possible to have inflation at intermediate value of @xmath10 ( see appendix [ question ] ) .",
    "however , in this paper we will only consider the case of inflation at the very beginning .      before entering into explicit calculations , we like to briefly comment on the problem one often encounters when implementing the quantization on the generalized chaplygin gas model , such as the one we introduced in section [ model ] .",
    "when promoting a scalar field @xmath37 to a quantum field , one expects that the scalar potential would receive loop corrections . by inspecting on eq .",
    "( [ eqn : earlypot ] ) , one can quickly recognize that this model is nonrenormalizable by simply noticing the scalar coupling @xmath53 has mass dimension @xmath54 .",
    "however , since the scalar field @xmath37 serves as the inflaton in the inflationary period , which decoheres entirely sometime after the onset of inflation , we do not expect the already decohered field to regain quantum fluctuations in the remaining period of inflation .",
    "we can therefore safely invoke the semiclassical approximation to the system beyond the point of decoherence , where one only has to consider the finite saddle - point contribution , and no regularization is required . on the other hand , before the onset of decoherence of the inflaton , one does have to treat the scalar field @xmath37 that represents the chaplygin gas fully quantum mechanically , thus some sort of regularization is still needed .    in our computation of the homogeneous part of the entropy , we invoke the minisuperspace approximation , which amounts to truncating large degrees of freedom and keeping only the homogeneous modes .",
    "therefore the minisuperspace approximation serves as our regularization , based on which a finite result is obtained in section [ qearlyentropy ] for the correct evaluation of the inhomogeneous part of the entropy at early times , one does have to impose a cutoff scale , below which our model is effective .",
    "we will discuss more on the issue of quantum corrections to the inhomogeneous entropy at early times at appendix [ loopperturb ] .",
    "as explained in section [ entropy ] , the contribution to the cosmological entanglement entropy is divisible into two parts ; in this section we will address the homogeneous contribution using the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) formalism and the minisuperspace treatment .",
    "the wavefunction of the universe depends on two modes : one from gravitation , the other from the scalar field of the chaplygin gas with the spatial dependence suppressed , thus the name `` homogeneous '' .",
    "we will treat the gravitational degree of freedom using the flat frw metric : @xmath55 throughout this paper we will follow the convention @xmath56 .",
    "the action of our model is @xmath57 , where the einstein - hilbert action can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the canonical momentum conjugated with @xmath10 .",

    "varying with the lapse function @xmath62 , one can obtain the hamiltonian equation @xmath63 , which can be quantized straightforwardly using the canonical prescription .",
    "hereafter we will stick to the gauge @xmath64 .      as mentioned in section [ qissuegcg ] , since the scalar field @xmath37 decoheres sometime during inflation , we can substitute @xmath37 by @xmath10 using the equation of motion . therefore , the matter action is replaced essentially by the fluid density , and the hamiltonian equation boils down to @xmath65 which , after the canonical quantization @xmath66 , becomes @xmath67\\psi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the wavefunction of the universe , @xmath69 denotes differential operators , and @xmath70 equals essentially to the generalized chaplygin gas density ( [ eqn : gcgdensity ] ) .",

    ", we will factor out a @xmath71 factor in both terms , making it resemble the schrdinger equation for a unit mass particle .    since we would like to compute the von neumann entropy from the matter wavefunction , which can be extracted from the born approximation @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the gravitational part , which , to the leading order , satisfies the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath74    the matter wavefunction @xmath75 satisfies the schrdinger equation corresponding to the potential of the scalar field : @xmath76 to simplify the computation",

    "this is expected since particle horizon only present in inflationary period , thus entanglement entropy is expected to decrease after some time in the transition .",
    "as mentioned in section [ entrophori ] , the entanglement entropy of expanding universe was found in literature to be proportional to the area of the particle horizon .",
    "we will show that the homogeneous entanglement entropy computed in last section conforms with the area law .",

    ", we can see that the character of entropy evolution in the semi - classical regime agrees well with the area law : at first its growth accelerates , then it slows down , and finally it decays when entering the radiation epoch .",
    "we should emphasis that the notion of particle horizon is only well - defined in inflationary epoch much earlier than the transition , such as the case of early half of the evolution curve .",
    "however , in the entire semi - classical regime before radiation dominance , the conformation of our method with the area law is clearly established .      as has been pointed out , the semiclassical treatment of chaplygin gas , as used in most literature , breaks down at the very beginning of the universe .",
    "physically , we expect that at the onset of inflation the inflaton should execute large quantum mechanical fluctuations that seed the cmb spectrum .",
    "one should therefore treat the scalar field quantum mechanically before the decoherence of inflation occurs .",
    "consider the scalar potential after substituting the saddle point relation , @xmath86 , which at early times is of the form @xmath87 .",

    "a full quantum treatment of both @xmath10 and @xmath37 is therefore necessary for early - time universe , which we will carry out in the following section [ earlyquantum ] .",

    "the resulting entropy profile is shown in figure [ fig : earlyentrop ] ( for @xmath112 ) .",
    "we see here that the general tendency of the entropy evolution is its accelerating growth , which matches well with the semi - classical result in figure [ initialentropy ] .",
    "this is expected since we use a well - defined wavepacket .    in figure",

    "here we provide two explanations for the appearance of this local entropy minimum . at the onset of inflation , the quantum fields are out of equilibrium .",

    "@xmath130 is a constant .",
    "the basic steps to calculate the entropy from eq.([eqn : inhomentropy ] ) are : ( i ) evolving the background metric by solving einstein equation ; ( ii ) solving the comoving curvature perturbation at time @xmath131 for different modes @xmath132 according to eq.([perturbation ] ) ; ( iii ) summing the entropy contributions from all modes which amounts to integrating eq.([eqn : inhomentropy ] ) over the momentum space @xmath132 . in the calculation",
    "we employ the full tree - level scalar potential without early or late time approximation , given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figure [ fig : ppf ] .",
    "observe that the tree - level contribution increases as power law in the radiation - dominant epoch started with @xmath133 , which compensates almost entirely the exponential decrease of the homogeneous part ( section [ semiclentropy ] ) of the entropy , which drops below @xmath134 after @xmath135 . on the other hand ,",
    "the homogeneous entropy during early times continues to increase , resulting in the monotonic rise of the net entropy in the semiclassical regime after the decoherence of the inflaton .    in the early stage of inflation",
    "there exists an entropy minimum , which confirms the result in fig [ fig : earlyentrop ] of section [ qearlyentropy ] that even after adding back some of the truncated degrees of freedom , there must still remain a persistent entropy minimum .",
    "we can therefore expect that the entropy minimum may actually persist to higher order quantum correction , rendering this turning point a real physical feature .",
    "we include some discussions about higher order correction in appendix [ loopperturb ] .",
    "in this section we present some general arguments on possible physical origin of the entropy decrease we found numerically in section [ qearlyentropy ] and [ pertsect ] with our model [ model ] .",
    "the purpose here is to extend our argument without relying on any specific model , although our previous model is natural in the sense discussed in the beginning of section [ choice ] , and in fact under the early and late time - scale approximations made in section [ semiclentropy ] it is just a combination of very general power - law inflation .",
    "the von neumann entropy formula is @xmath136 if the integrals are sufficiently well - behaved , i.e. uniformly convergent , then we can take the derivative with respect to parameter @xmath10 , resulting in the change of entropy : @xmath137\\mathrm{d}\\phi.\\ ] ] note that as long as @xmath138 and the integral converges , the above quantity stays positive , that is the entropy should increase monotonically .",
    "we comment here that such condition of monotonicity is a particular feature only in our situation , since the inaccessible environment depends on the metric expansion @xmath10 ( which happens to coincide with cosmological time ) .",
    "in other quantum open systems , time will enter as external parameter in the density matrix @xmath139 , and in general one can not obtain such a monotonic constraint of entropy from this simple argument .",
    "there are two separate issues for this monotonicity :    if any of the entropy integrals eq.([eqn : entropyintegral ] ) or eq.([eqn : entropychnge ] ) has bad behavior such that some regularization should be imposed , or the integral in @xmath37 is oscillatory so uniform convergence is not guaranteed , then the above monotonicity argument fails . in the first case",
    ", the change of entropy will receive another `` boundary contribution '' : @xmath140 with the cutoff @xmath141 .",
    "however , this contribution can render the entropy variation negative if @xmath142 is a decreasing function of @xmath10 .",
    "physically , it means that as the cosmological time evolves the fluctuations of scalar field @xmath37 will be suppressed more and more , therefore it has less space for fluctuations .",
    "for the second case , the decrease of entropy is attributed not to any microscopic model , but to the stochastic nature of quantum physics .",
    "it has been a long debate whether the unitarity condition holds for the evolution of the universe . a well - known fact about qft in curved background space - time",
    "is that a large number of particles can be created as the universe expands .",
    "thus in our point of view the observable universe does not obey the unitarity condition .",
    "this is reminiscent of the hawking radiation produced by the nontrivial black hole background .",
    "the hawking particle so produced can be interpreted as an entanglement between the observable and unobservable regions in such background .",
    "thus a natural proposition is that the universe _ as a whole _ should obey unitarity , but not separately in either observable or unobservable region .",
    "we therefore expect that the density matrix @xmath143 can exceed unity in either region , which is a natural consequence of particle production .    in the particle production",
    "( both matter and graviton ) region , the change of entropy , eq.([eqn : entropychnge ] ) , is negative ; whereas in the dissipative region , the change of entropy is positive . putting this assessment into a concrete example ,",
    "let us suppose a dissipative mechanism ( say from coarse - graining ) that results in an exponential decay of the total probability .",
    "then the evolution of entropy can have the form displayed in fig .",
    "7 .        from the unitarity s point of view",
    ", the decrease of entropy boils down to the question of why our density matrix is so large at the very beginning ?",
    "this is not too surprising since we expect quantum effects , which account for the particle production , to be prevailing near the planck scale at the beginning of the universe .",
    "( note that large density matrix does not imply the largeness of the total number of produced particles , but rather the _ rate _ of particle production . ) as the cosmological time @xmath10 elapses , the density matrix becomes smaller due to the slowdown of particle production rate .",
    "as discussed above , particle production is a process that drives the early universe out of equilibrium .",
    "thus as time further evolves after such entropy decrease , the universe gradually recovers the equilibrium condition .",
    "it is only by then can one invoke second law of thermodynamics as the arrow of time .",
    "in this paper we reconsidered inflation as a possible solution to the entropy problem on the basis neglected in the past literature that the probability of inflation , when taking its accompanied horizon into consideration , is not necessary small .",
    "indeed our computation suggests that the initial entanglement entropy should have a sizable value in order to compensate for its subsequent reduction at the beginning of inflation ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ppf ] ) , which indicates that the onset of inflation could be highly probable .",
    "we explored this notion by investigating the evolution of entanglement entropy from the onset of inflation to the radiation era using a toy model , which we believe to be generic enough to capture the essential feature of entanglement entropy evolution because most calculations we made do not involve the model s artificial transition period between the two epochs , while at the same time it has the advantage of preserving unitarity instead of a discontinuous phase transition , which is disallowed in the quantum mechanical framework for the entire universe .",
    "our results of quantum entanglement entropy evolution are shown in figure [ initialentropy ] for homogeneous early evolution after decoherence of inflaton , figure [ radiation ] for homogeneous late - time evolution , figure [ fig : earlyentrop ] for homogeneous early evolution near the onset of inflation , and figure [ fig : ppf ] for inhomogeneous evolution at the tree - level .",
    "the semi - classical evolution of entanglement entropy induced by the existence of particle horizon is shown to obey the area law , while near the onset of inflation this area law is found to be violated due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the net result for the period after decoherence of inflaton ( in our case provided by the generalized chaplygin gas at early time ) is that the entanglement entropy increases monotonically , which results in a large amount of entropy generation and agrees with our experience with thermodynamic laws .    on the other hand , the situation before decoherence is more subtle . in particular ,",
    "entropy minimum arisen from quantum corrections at early times appears in both the homogeneous part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : earlyentrop ] ) as well as the tree - level inhomogeneous part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppf ] ) previously observed in @xcite .",
    "the persistence of the entropy minimum after putting back some of the degrees of freedom suggests that it is a real physical feature and we expect this entropy minimum not be completely erased by higher order corrections .    in section [ sec :",
    "explain ] we discussed possible physical origins that cause the entropy decrease and result in the subsequent entropy minimum : these include effective regularization on quantum fluctuation , particle production and dissipation . in particular , the latter two processes contribute to nonequilibrium effects during the early stage of accelerating expansion , rendering equilibrium physics such as the thermodynamic law of entropy temporarily inapplicable . by the same token ,",
    "the equilibrium thermodynamic law gradually recovers as a result of a natural decay of such processes , thereby providing us the entropic arrow of time after the entropy reaches its minimum .",
    "we also like to comment on the possible connection of our investigation to other field - theoretic approaches such as in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the decrease of entropy , which is a correction to the area law , can be compared to that in eq.([eqn : ententropyscaling ] ) obtained in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if canonical quantum gravity can be regarded as a low energy limit of string theory , we expect that similar result may possibly be derived from supergravity or full string theory , although as remarked in section [ qissuegcg ] , a good uv description is lacking in our effective model .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : after the onset of inflation the entropy will soon decrease , due to the dynamics of the expanding universe , to a minimum and rapidly increase thereafter .",
    "we therefore suggest that the special initial condition required for the thermodynamic arrow can be naturally provided by the inflation itself without the need to introduce any ad hoc assumptions .",
    "we appreciate yen chin ong , je - an gu and chris gauthier of the ntu lecospa center for their useful suggestions .",
    "this research is supported by the national science council of taiwan and the ntu lecospa center .",
    "in this appendix we will show it is possible in our model to realize inflation starting from an expanding but non - inflationary stage , thereby the parameter space for inflation can be wider than considered in section [ parameters ] , although in this paper we restrict to the case of inflation at the start .    for the inflation to start",
    ", the kinetic energy must be small in comparison with the potential energy @xcite , which in our model amounts to the situation where the time derivative of the field @xmath144 as well as its spatial derivative , @xmath145 , be small in comparison with the potential @xmath146 the former requires @xmath147 while the later will be the case after @xmath148 with @xmath149 . comparing to the requirement of early inflation at @xmath32 in eq.([eqn : constraints ] ) , we see that there is a finite nonzero range of parameters where the kinetic term is suppressed as the universe grows but not necessarily inflates , thereby paving the way for the system to become `` potential dominated '' and ready for the onset of inflation .",
    "in this appendix we briefly discuss higher order corrections to the inhomogeneous entropy .",
    "quantum corrections will only be important at early times . according to eq.([eqn : earlypot ] )",
    ", the scalar field potential has the form @xmath150 where we have absorbed the constant @xmath37 into @xmath78 .",
    "thus in comparison to the lowest order calculation , where only modes @xmath151 and @xmath152 are entangled : @xmath153 there is an additional entanglement due to the nonlinear interaction of eq.([eqn : earlypot2 ] ) .",
    "this contribution can be partially accounted for by the noise kernel @xmath154 and the diffusion kernel @xmath155 @xcite : @xmath156 \\right.\\nonumber \\\\    & \\left.+ \\mathcal{p}_{\\zeta}(t )      \\int_{-\\infty}^{t}\\!dt ' \\ ,   \\left [   n_k \\partial_t g_{\\mathrm{ret}}(t , t')-d_k\\partial_t g(t , t ' ) \\right]\\right\\},\\label{evoldetc } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath157 and @xmath158 obtained through the standard diagrammatic rules , where higher - order loop effect enters .",
    "however , upon expansion of the potential eq.([eqn : earlypot2 ] ) one finds infinitely many types of vertexes , where each type will have its own coupling due to counter terms : @xmath159 this immediately leads to problems when performing perturbative loop calculations .",
    "therefore numerical lattice computation seems desirable to obtain higher order corrections to early time inhomogeneous entropy .",
