    "indeed , recent investigations have shown that the physical properties of lno can be tuned by reducing its dimensionality or applying strain .",
    "for instance , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations found that a single unit cell ( uc ) of lno sandwiched between layers of the band insulator laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) and thus under tensile strain displays a cuprate - like fermi surface , identifying lno as a possible candidate for exotic superconductivity.@xcite inspired by these predictions a large number of experimental and theoretical studies have been performed on ultra - thin films and superlattices ( sls ) .",
    "@xcite    experimentally , ultra - thin films are found to exhibit a dimensional crossover from metallic to insulating behavior upon reducing the film thickness , with critical values ranging from 3 to 9 uc @xcite .",
    "the situation is slightly different in lno - based sls : while thicker lno layers embedded in sl structures remain metallic at all temperatures , 2 uc layers display a temperature - dependent mi transition.@xcite the critical temperature depends mainly on the epitaxial strain induced by the substrate .",
    "the strain also leads to a distortion of the octahedral ligand field and hence a lifting of the @xmath8 orbital degeneracy .",
    "the resulting orbital polarization increases almost linearly with the induced strain .",
    "the reason for the appearance of the insulating state in both sls and ultra - thin films is still under debate .",
    "different scenarios like anderson localization , @xcite mott insulator transition , @xcite charge disproportionation , @xcite and spin density wave @xcite have been discussed .",
    "it should be noted that in superlattices the necessity of octahedral connectivity across the interfaces in combination with strain induced by the substrate can stabilize different distortions compared to the situation in epitaxial films.@xcite we emphasize in particular that in comparison to ultrathin films the superlattice structures allow for a better defined and efficient control of the strain effects . since lno with its lao@xmath9 and nio@xmath10 sublayers is polar",
    ", the ( 001)-oriented free surfaces of thin lno films tend to reconstruct structurally by polar distortions or octahedral rotations to minimize the electrostatic energy .",
    "@xcite the modified structure results in a change of the electronic structure , at least near the surface .",
    "in contrast , the lno layers in the sls are embedded in lao , a host material of like polarity , and are thus stabilized against structural effects resulting from polar discontinuities , as shown by x - ray diffraction.@xcite    thus , the physical properties of the strained lno layers and their dependence on dimensionality can be studied under clean conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the absence of additional ionic or electronic surface and interface reconstructions    direct insight into the electronic structure can be achieved by photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) .",
    "many of the scenarios mentioned above are reflected directly or indirectly in the microscopic electronic structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the single - particle spectral function , to which pes provides direct access .",
    "such investigations have focused so far on ( ultra - thin ) films by angle - integrated @xcite as well as angle - resolved pes ( arpes ) .",
    "@xcite however , arpes studies on sls require a more bulk - sensitive approach , since the lno layers are buried below several unit cells of the host material ( lao in our case ) .",
    "conventional photoemission with low - energy photons is limited by its very low information depth of a few angstroms only , determined by the photoelectron mean free path ( mfp ) and therefore can not easily access the lno layers .",
    "in contrast , photons in the soft x - ray ( sx ) regime allow for higher mfp at still reasonable momentum resolution ( @xmath1-resolution ) , thereby enabling @xmath1-resolved probing of the buried electronic structure in such sls.@xcite    in this study , we present sx - arpes measurements on lno / lao sls under compressive strain and a detailed analysis of the buried electronic structure . besides a significant loss of quasiparticle ( qp ) coherence near the fermi level ( @xmath11 ) for the two - dimensional ground state , observed in the angle - integrated valence band spectra , our @xmath1-resolved measurements trace the dimensional crossover from a three - dimensional fermi surface in the 4 uc lno - sl to two - dimensional behavior in the 2 uc lno - sl .",
    "although the intensity distribution in our @xmath1-space maps is strongly affected by x - ray photoelectron diffraction ( xpd ) , we are able to extract bandstructure information on the ni @xmath7-derived hole pocket states in all lno / lao sls .",
    "an indication of the ni @xmath6-derived electron pocket is only observed in the 2 uc lno - sl . the residual fermi surface observed in this sample displays strong nesting properties which are consistent with the spin - density wave ( sdw ) scenario recently put forward as explanation for the insulating low - temperature ground state .",
    "lno / lao superlattices with different lno layer thickness were grown by pulsed laser deposition on ( 001 ) lasralo@xmath12 ( lsao ) single crystal substrates .",
    "the deposition starts with a number of @xmath13 ( = 2 , 4 ) unit cells of lno followed by the same number of lao layers .",

    "additionally , a ( 10//4)@xmath14 sl was prepared being used as a thick lno reference layer , also capped by 4 uc lao .",
    "the lno / lao stacks are compressively strained to the lsao substrate , since the lattice mismatch between the lsao and bulk pseudo - cubic lno ( @xmath15   ) @xcite is @xmath16% ( ref .  )",
    ". the induced biaxial strain , which is stable up to a sl thickness of @xmath17  nm ( ref .  ) , was confirmed by x - ray diffraction with lattice parameters @xmath18   and @xmath19   ( ref .  ) .",
    "the photoemission experiments were performed at the adress beamline of the swiss light source with a specs phoibos 150 spectrometer using @xmath20-polarized photons.@xcite the overall energy resolution was @xmath21  mev at a photon energy of 700  ev . during the experiment",

    "i.e. _ well within the sdw phase , because a nesting instability would normally open a gap and destroy the fs . however , as already seen in the edcs of the ( 2//2 ) sl , there is no full gap opening at @xmath11 , at least within our experimental resolution .",
    "this behavior could be attributed to an insufficient sdw stabilization due to pronounced order parameter fluctuations , not fully unexpected in the two - dimensional limit .",
    "this picture is supported by very recent magneto - resistivity measurements performed on similar lno / lao sls.@xcite hepting _ _ et al.__@xcite also find that the sdw state remains metallic , i.e. the gap does not encompass the entire fs .",
    "order parameter fluctuations may also explain the suppression of quasiparticle coherence and the absence of sdw - induced band backfolding , in remarkable contrast to recent arpes results on ultra - thin films .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic structure of compressively strained lno / lao sls grown on lsao substrates by angle - resolved soft x - ray photoemission .",
    "@xmath1-integrated valence band spectra show a loss of quasiparticle coherence below 3 uc lno layer thickness .",
    "corresponding transport measurements exhibit a temperature dependent mi crossover in the ( 2//2 ) sl , while the ( 4//4 ) and ( 10//4 ) sls stay metallic down to low temperatures .",
    "although the analysis of the angle - resolved measurements is complicated by strong xpd - induced intensity modulations , the measured angle - resolved maps reveal a dimensional crossover of the fs from three - dimensional in the ( 4//4 ) sl to two - dimensional behavior in the ( 2//2 ) sl . by comparing the maps with results from dft calculations ,",
    "the ni @xmath7 states , which form the hole states around the a points , are clearly identified in the fs of all measured sls .",
    "evidence for the electron pocket derived from ni  @xmath6 orbital is found only in the ( 2//2 ) sl , but could not be observed for sls with thicker lno and lao layers .",
    "we attribute this to pronounced xpd effects in the lao overlayer , which interfere with or even obscure @xmath1-dependent fermi surface information    the measured fs topology , in particular the shape of hole pockets in the ( 2//2 ) sl , support fs nesting .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario of a dimensionality - induced sdw - instability , with the nesting properties of our experimental fs in excellent agreement with the reported sdw wavevector .",
    "thus , our results strongly support magnetic ordering in the two - dimensional ground state of ultra - thin lno layers embedded in a sl . in line with other experimental as well as theoretical studies , no indication of correlation - induced fs modifications",
    "was found for the sls under compressive strain .",
    "further studies , particularly on lno / lao sls under _ tensile _ strain , are needed to investigate the tuneability of the electronic structure by strain _ and _ correlation effects in the two - dimensional limit .",
    "in the sls the lno layer is buried below a lao capping layer .",
    "thus , the measured valence band is a superposition of the lao and lno valence states .",
    "only , if the valence band maximum of the insulating lao , @xmath81 , is far enough below the fermi level @xmath11 , the observed spectral weight near @xmath11 can unambiguously be assigned to the ni  @xmath2 states in the lno layers .",
    "@xmath81 is determined by analyzing the position of a suitable core level from lao , @xmath82 , al  @xmath27 , and comparing its position with a reference system containing lao , where core - level position and valence band onset are well known . here",
    ", we use as reference the well - studied laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 heterostructure with @xmath83  ev and @xmath84  ev ( ref . ) .",
    "the energy position of the al  @xmath27 core level in the lno / lao sls is found to be @xmath85  ev [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : al2pni3p ] ] , independent of the lao and lno layer thickness . from the obvious relationship",
    "@xmath86 we determine the position of the valence band maximum in the lao overlayer as @xmath87  ev .",
    "consequently , any spectral weight measured between @xmath11 and @xmath88  ev can only result from the ni  @xmath2 states in the lno layers .",
    "the relationship between the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons and the momentum perpendicular to the sample surface is described by the following equation including the non - negligible photon momentum component @xmath89 [ see fig .  [ fig : cecs ]  ( g ) ] : @xmath90 where @xmath52 is the free electron mass , @xmath91 the inner potential , @xmath92 the kinetic energy , and @xmath42 the emission angle . for thick lno films",
    "a value of @xmath93  ev has been reported.@xcite we do not expect a large variation of this phenomenological parameter for our lno / lao sls .",
    "thus , by using the lattice constant perpendicular to the surface @xmath94 ( ref .  ) and taking the experimental geometry into account , the photon energies required for probing fermi level states at the center ( @xmath95  @xmath35 ) and the edge of the bz ( @xmath96 ) perpendicular to the surface are @xmath97  ev and @xmath72  ev , respectively .",
