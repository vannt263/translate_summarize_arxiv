    "the magellanic - type galaxy ngc  1313 ( @xmath7 mpc ) is known from ground - based imaging to host several ymcs @xcite .",
    "the western part of the galaxy appears to have experienced a recent burst of star formation during which also a particularly massive star cluster was formed ( # 379 in the list of @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster has an age of @xmath8 myrs ( see below ) , consistent with the peak of field star formation activity in the region @xcite .",
    "the integrated magnitude @xmath9 corresponds to a mass of 175000 @xmath2 for a chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "the cluster is well resolved on our acs / wfc images ( progr .",
    "i d 9774 ; p.i .",
    "s.  s. larsen ) , and the cmd is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1313 ] ( left ) .",
    "several distinct features are seen : the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) is at @xmath10 and @xmath11 . at brighter absolute magnitudes ( @xmath12 )",
    "are the blue core he burning stars ( `` blue supergiants '' , bsgs ) .",
    "the red core he burning stars ( `` red supergiants '' , rsgs ) are seen at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "also shown are padua isochrones @xcite for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , 7.5 and 8.0 .",
    "the cluster appears slightly older than @xmath17 .",
    "isochrones do not fully illustrate the distribution of stars in the cmd .",
    "in particular , the gap between the msto and the bsgs is only revealed when the _ density _ of stars in the cmd is shown . the centre panel shows the synthetic hess diagram for a @xmath18 padua isochrone , while the right - hand panel shows a @xmath19 geneva isochrone .",
    "these ages correspond to msto masses of 7.4 @xmath2 and 8.1 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "both sets of models reproduce the overall distribution of stars in the cmd fairly well , albeit for somewhat different ages . the rsgs may be slightly too red ( cool ) in both cases .",
    "the apparent difference in the model colours of the rsgs is mostly due to the fact that wfpc2 f439w@xmath20f555w colours are shown for the geneva isochrones , while the proper acs / wfc f435w@xmath20f555w colours are used for the padua isochrones . in reality , the difference in @xmath21 between the padua and geneva rsgs is small , with the geneva rsgs being some 150 k cooler .",
    "one long - standing problem concerns the relative fraction of rsgs and bsgs @xcite .",
    "models tend to predict a decreasing bsg / rsg ratio with increasing metallicity , while observations show the opposite .",
    "fortunately , a comparison with the data is possible without an exact calibration between fundamental stellar properties ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 ) and colours .",
    "the boxes drawn in fig .  [ fig : n1313 ] indicate regions of the cmd where we count rsgs and bsgs . in the observed cmd",
    "we find 16 bsgs and 17 rsgs , corresponding to a ratio of bsg / rsg = @xmath23 . within the error ,",
    "this is consistent with the model predictions : bsg / rsg = 0.73 and 0.74 for the padua and geneva models .    to summarize , the agreement between models and observations seems rather satisfactory for this cluster .",
    "this is true both for the colours and luminosities of various types of stars and the bsg / rsg ratio .",
    "since the stars in this cluster only barely qualify for the label `` massive '' , this was perhaps to be expected .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the cmd - based age could be either 50 myr or 35 myr , depending on the choice of models .",
    "an important corollary is that absolute ages derived from _ integrated _ colours ( or spectra ) are likely to be uncertain by at least the same amount .",
    "the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  1569 is well known for hosting two very compact , massive young clusters .",
    "although it is about a factor of two closer than ngc  1313 , observations of the clusters in ngc  1569 are challenging due to both their more compact structure , the general degree of crowding , and the significant galactic foreground reddening ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "nevertheless , both clusters a and b are resolved into individual stars in acs / hrc data ( progr .",
    "9300 ; p.i .",
    "h.  ford ) ; here we concentrate on cluster b for which we also have keck / nirspec near - infrared spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the reddening - corrected absolute @xmath25 magnitude is @xmath26 @xcite , corresponding to a mass of about 280000 @xmath2 for an age of 15 myrs .    , but for ngc  1569-b .",
    "the 75% completeness limit is indicated in the left - hand panel.,width=453 ]    the cmd for ngc  1569-b is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1569 ] . the rsgs can again be clearly discerned , but the identification of bsgs is less obvious and the msto is too faint to be detected .",
    "the best fitting padua models have an age of @xmath27 while the best fitting geneva models are slightly younger ; @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding msto masses are 13 @xmath2 and 14 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we have again assumed @xmath15 models , which give the best fits , although this may not exactly match the actual metallicity of ngc  1569 .",
    "however , neither set of models provides a very good match to the observations for any metallicity . even for fairly generous limits in the selection of bsgs ,",
    "the observed bsg / rsg ratio of 28/60 = @xmath29 is well below the model predictions ( bsg / rsg = 1.28 and 0.87 for the padua and geneva models ) .",
    "the cmd also shows a small number of very bright ( @xmath30 ) , blue stars which are not predicted by any model for this age .",
    "these are redder than the fainter blue stars , and thus unlikely to be simple blends .",
    "one possibility is that these stars have somewhat younger ages than the majority of stars in cluster b.",
    "the two cases discussed here demonstrate that useful information can be extracted from the cmds of star clusters well beyond the local group .",
    "young , massive ( @xmath31 @xmath2 ) clusters offer significant samples of stars with similar age and chemical composition , offering a potentially powerful way to test models for massive stars .",
    "most current alternatives either suffer from small number statistics ( e.g.  open clusters in the milky way ) or from difficulties disentangling the contributions from stars of different ages , hence masses ( e.g.  resolved stellar populations in local group galaxies ) .",
