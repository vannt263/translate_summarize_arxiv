    "models generalizing the einstein - hilbert action have been proposed , where a nonlinear function of the curvature scalar , @xmath0 , is introduced in the action .",
    "these modified theories of gravity seem to provide a natural gravitational alternative to dark energy , and in addition to allow for a unification of the early - time inflation @xcite and late - time cosmic speed - up @xcite .",
    "these models seem to explain the four cosmological phases @xcite .",
    "they are also very useful in high energy physics , in explaining the hierarchy problem and the unification of guts with gravity @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the galactic dynamics of massive test particles may be understood without the need for dark matter was also considered in the framework of @xmath0 gravity models @xcite .",
    "one may also generalize the action by considering an explicit coupling between an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature , @xmath5 , and the lagrangian density of matter @xcite .",
    "note that these couplings imply the violation of the equivalence principle @xcite , which is highly constrained by solar system tests .",
    "a fundamental issue extensively addressed in the literature is the viability of the proposed @xmath0 models @xcite . in this context , it has been argued that most @xmath0 models proposed so far in the metric formalism violate weak field solar system constraints @xcite , although viable models do exist @xcite .",
    "the issue of stability @xcite also plays an important role for the viability of cosmological solutions @xcite . in the context of cosmological structure formation observations",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that the inclusion of inhomogeneities is necessary to distinguish between dark energy models and modified theories of gravity , and therefore , the evolution of density perturbations and the study of perturbation theory in @xmath0 gravity is of considerable importance @xcite .",
    "a great deal of attention has also been paid to the issue of static and spherically symmetric solutions of the gravitational field equations in @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "solutions in the presence of a perfect fluid were also analyzed @xcite , where it was shown that the pressure and energy density profiles do not uniquely determine @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to this , it was found that matching the exterior schwarzschild - de sitter metric to the interior metric leads to additional constraints that severely limit the allowed fluid configurations . an interesting approach in searching for exact spherically symmetric solutions in @xmath0 theories of gravity was explored in @xcite , via the noether symmetry approach , and a general analytic procedure was developed to deal with the newtonian limit of @xmath0 gravity in @xcite .",
    "analytical and numerical solutions of the gravitational field equations for stellar configurations in @xmath0 gravity theories were also presented @xcite , and the generalized tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations for these theories were derived @xcite .    in the context of @xmath0 modified theories of gravity , it was recently shown that power - law inflation and late - time cosmic accelerated expansion can be explained by a modified @xmath0-maxwell theory @xcite , due to breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field through a non - minimal gravitational coupling .",

    "later , plebaski explored and presented other examples of nonlinear electrodynamic lagrangians @xcite , and showed that the born - infeld theory satisfies physically acceptable requirements .",
