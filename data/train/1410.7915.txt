    "a dense and hot plasma interacting with a strong neutrino flux arises .",
    "it has become clear that strong magnetic fields of up to @xmath0  gauss can be generated , exceeding the electron - mass critical field @xmath1  gauss .",
    "neutrino processes are also important for the cooling of supernova cores and neutron stars where neutrinos are emitted from the dense central region",
    ". observations of neutron stars lead to a wide spread of magnetic - field values , and very large magnetic fields @xmath2  gauss have been identified in some objects called magnetars  @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying properties and dynamics of such astrophysical phenomena requires a detailed understanding of quantum processes involving neutrinos under the influence of a strong magnetic field and relativistic plasma .",
    "the plasma and magnetic field are optically active media and therefore can significantly influence the photon - neutrino interaction which in vacuum arises at loop level and turns out to be extremely weak . on the other hand , the photon - neutrino interaction within a medium can lead to actually observed effects , notably the neutrino luminosity of a plasma by the @xmath3 decay  @xcite . in this process",
    ", the plasma has two effects : it provides photons with an effective mass , enabling the decay kinematics , and it provides an effective interaction between neutrinos and photons . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiative decay of a massive neutrino is kinematically allowed in vacuum ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , an active medium can influence both the decay amplitude and particle kinematics , and hence , the decay rate can change significantly  @xcite .",
    "early studies of the radiative decay of a massless neutrino in a magnetic field were performed in refs .",

    "@xcite for electromagnetic fields of different configurations . in all of these papers",
    ", the decay probability was calculated for low - energy neutrinos ( @xmath7 ) and under the assumption that the modification of the photon dispersion law can be neglected .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the field - induced amplitude of the ultra - relativistic neutrino decay in a magnetic field is not suppressed by the smallness of the neutrino mass , in contrast to vacuum  @xcite .",
    "we recall that with increasing photon energy , its dispersion in a strong @xmath8 field differs from vacuum and each photon polarization has its own dispersion law  @xcite . in particular , the photon four - momentum  @xmath9 can be space like and its square can be sufficiently large , @xmath10 , to allow the transition @xmath11 of a lighter neutrino to a heavier one ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in other words , the strongly modified photon dispersion law implies that in practice the radiative decay probability of ultra - relativistic neutrinos in strong magnetic fields does not depend on the neutrino mass spectrum .    for high - energy neutrinos ( @xmath13 ) in a strong constant magnetic field",
    ", the process @xmath14 was studied in ref .",

    "in particular , the decay probability of a heavier neutrino to a lighter one and a photon in a thermal medium was calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite under the assumption that the particle dispersion relations were not affected by the plasma .",
    "later , the study of the neutrino - photon interaction was extended to high energies in a strongly magnetized electron - positron plasma  @xcite . in this case , apart from the modified photon dispersion , large radiative corrections exist near the @xmath16 resonance  otherwise the result is overestimated .",
    "most recently , the decay of a massive neutrino was analyzed for the conditions of a strongly magnetized , degenerate electron gas @xcite .",
    "there are no theoretical restrictions on the existence of astrophysical objects where both a strong magnetic field and degenerate plasma can exist .",
    "several objects called magnetars  @xcite have been observed which probably contain such a medium , i.e. , 14 soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) of which 10 are confirmed and 4 are candidates as well as 14 anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) with 12 being confirmed and candidates  @xcite . the existence of such objects motivates the study of elementary processes under extreme conditions .    the main point of our paper is to extend the analysis of ref .",

    "ordinary neutrinos have sub - ev masses so that radiative decays would not be kinematically possible .",
    "of course , the presence of electrons implies a weak potential for electron neutrinos of @xmath28 which is a very small effect compared with the plasma frequency .",

    "whatever the final verdict on such speculations , we here go through the exercise of calculating the radiative decay of nonrelativistic sterile neutrinos in an optically active medium which can be identified with both an un - magnetized or strongly magnetized plasma . our main new point beyond the previous literature is to include the photon dispersion relation consistently .",
