    "[ [ section ] ]    classical schur - weyl duality relates the representations of the general linear group and the symmetric group via commuting actions on tensor space .",
    "the brauer algebra was introduced by brauer in 1937 to play the role of the symmetric group when one replaces the general linear group by the orthogonal or symplectic group . for any non - negative integer @xmath1 , any commutative ring @xmath2 , and any @xmath3",
    ", we can define the brauer algebra @xmath4 as being the @xmath2-algebra with basis all pair partitions of @xmath5 .",
    "we can represent these basis elements as diagrams ( so - called brauer diagrams ) having @xmath5 vertices arranged in 2 rows of @xmath1 vertices each , such that each vertex is linked to precisely one other vertex .",
    "the multiplication is then given by concatenation , removing all closed loops , and scalar multiplication by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of closed loops removed .",
    "it s easy to see that @xmath4 is generated by the set @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given in figure [ sigmae ] .",
    "the symmetric group algebra @xmath11 appears naturally as the subalgebra of @xmath4 generated by the @xmath9 s . note that @xmath11 also occurs as a quotient of @xmath4 as explained below",
    "this turns out to be very helpful in studying the representation theory of @xmath4 .",
    "assume for a moment that @xmath0 is a unit .",
    "consider the idempotent given by @xmath12 .",
    "then it is easy to see that    @xmath13    now fix @xmath14 and recall that the simple @xmath15-modules are indexed by partitions of @xmath1 , that is for each partition @xmath16 we have a ( simple ) specht module @xmath17 . using ( [ ebe ] )",
    "we can easily deduce by induction on @xmath1 that the simple modules for @xmath4 are indexed by the set @xmath18 of partitions of @xmath19 .",
    "for each @xmath20 , we denote the corresponding simple module by @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath4 is semisimple , the simple modules can be constructed explicitely by inflating ( or globalising ) the corresponding specht module , see for example @xcite .",
    "however the algebra @xmath4 is not always semisimple . in 1988 , wenzl showed in @xcite that if @xmath4 is not semisimple then @xmath22 , and in 2005 , rui gave an explicit criterion for semisimplicity in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the simple modules when @xmath4 is not semisimple .",
    "so we will assume that @xmath23 .",
    "for the moment we will also assume that @xmath24 .",
    "in this case , @xmath4 is a quasi - hereditary algebra with respect to the opposite order to the one given by the size of partitions .",
    "( in fact , we will work with a refinement of this order , see section 2.2 ) .",
    "in particular , the indecomposable projective modules @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) have a filtration by standard modules @xmath27 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the standard modules can be constructed explicitly ( as inflation of specht modules , as in the semisimple case ) and we have surjective homomorphisms @xmath28 for each @xmath20 .",
    "now the decomposition matrix @xmath29 $ ] has been determined by the second author in @xcite and its inverse is given in @xcite .",
    "this gives a closed form for the dimension of the simple modules ( although the coefficients of @xmath30 are not easy to compute in practice ) .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    we have natural embeddings of the brauer algebras @xmath31 by adding a vertical edge between the last vertex in each row of every brauer diagram .",

    "@xmath16 and @xmath34 , we write @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) if @xmath16 is obtained from @xmath34 by adding ( resp . removing ) a box to its young diagram .",
    "from @xcite we have exact sequences @xmath37 @xmath38 where we define @xmath39 when @xmath40 .",
    "the first objective of this paper is to describe the corresponding result for all simple modules .",
    "more precisely , we describe completely the module structure of @xmath41 for all @xmath20 and all non - negative integers @xmath1 .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    walk bases for standard modules for generic values of @xmath0 were given by leduc and ram in @xcite .",
    "their construction relies on complex combinatorial objects such as the king polynomials ( first introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "these bases do not specialise to @xmath42 ( except in very low rank ) .",
    "however , it follows implicitly from @xcite that the truncation of these representations to certain @xmath0- permissible up - down tableaux gives bases for the @xmath0-permissible simple modules .",
    "more recently @xcite introduced a geometric characterisation of the representation theory of the brauer algebra .",
    "it turns out that the combinatorics used in @xcite and @xcite can be explained in a uniform and natural way in this geometrical context .",
    "in particular , we obtain a striking characterisation of the roots of the king polynomials .",
    "motivated by this , the second objective of this paper is to recast the contruction of @xcite in the geometrical setting .",
    "this provides a unification of the classical and modern approaches , but is also done with a view to treating arbitrary simple modules ( and other characteristics ) in further work .",
    "in section 2 , we recall and extend the necessary setup from @xcite for the geometrical interpretation of the representation theory of the brauer algebra @xmath4 . in section 3 , we recall the construction of weight diagrams and cap diagrams associated to every partition @xmath16 and integer @xmath0 introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we develop some of their properties and recall how these can be used to describe the blocks and the decomposition numbers for @xmath4 . in section 4 we give a complete description of the module structure of the restriction from @xmath4 to @xmath43 of every simple module in terms of cap diagrams .",
    "we start section 5 by recalling the representations constructed by leduc and ram for the generic brauer algebra .",
    "we then give a geometric interpretation of the combinatorics used in their construction and deduce , by specialisation and truncation , explicit bases for an important class of simple modules .",
