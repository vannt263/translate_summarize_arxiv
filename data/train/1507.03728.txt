    "tunnelings between vacua become a relevant subject to study in order to answer the ultimate questions : why are we here , and where were we from ?    while the real purpose is to bring string theory down to the low energy level , flux compactification in much simpler toy models has also been intensively studied@xcite . in this simplified environment",
    ", one can make useful predictions while at the same time avoiding the mathematical complication .",
    "recently , tunneling in the landscape of einstein  maxwell flux compactification was investigated  @xcite .",

    "it is somewhat surprising that such a simple toy model can exhibit a rich landscape of vacua .",
    "it should be noted that in the context of realistic string compactification , the einstein  maxwell ( and einstein  higgs ) flux vacua provide a low - energy effective pictures .",
    "it is thus expected that at a high energy regime close to the string level , nonlinear terms should be taken into account .",
    "a natural nonlinear modification of the maxwell lagrangian is the born - infeld theory  @xcite ; once constructed to regularize the self - energy divergence in the maxwell theory , it has regained interest as the d - brane lagrangian in the last 30 years .",
    "there is an extensive discussions on einstein - born - infeld theories and their solutions in the literature . the reissner ",

    "infeld black hole is discussed in refs  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this einstein  born  infeld theory is generalized into born  infeld gravity coupled to born  infeld electrodynamics to study its corresponding static solutions and cosmological phenomena  @xcite .    a recent paper on dirac  born  infeld ( dbi)-gravity flux vacua  @xcite discusses the flux landscape in the context of dbi - type gravity theories .",
    "there , since the equations of motion do not lead to canonical einstein equations , the authors employ a method of a minimum potential introduced by wetterich  @xcite to obtain minima which correspond to the flux vacua . here , we follow a different route . in this paper , we consider einstein  born  infeld theories and study the corresponding spontaneous compactification that leads to flux vacua .",
    "these models are the natural uv completion of the einstein  maxwell theory and can be perceived as one step closer toward the realistic string flux compactification .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss flux compactification in the einstein - scalar - dbi ( dirac  born  infeld ) theory , both in five and higher dimensions .",
    "next we consider the six - dimensional einstein  born  infeld  abelian theory and study its flux vacua . in each case",
    "we discuss the effect of compactification on four - dimensional observers by means of dimensional reduction .",

    "the complex scalar field is assumed to be static , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the field phase .",

    "[ vagnbk ] , the larger the @xmath22 ( weaker coupling ) , the more stable the vacua are .",
    "this is simply because in the limit @xmath34 our lagrangian reduces to the ordinary five - dimensional einstein  higgs theory . on the other hand , for @xmath35 it enters the strong - coupling regime . in this regime the repulsive bosonic force increases , and hence the vacua tend to be less ads .",
    "there is not much to say about the qualitative results of the potential shape .",

    "another interesting property is that , despite being perturbatively stable , all vacua with @xmath0 suffer from nonperturbative instability .",

    "@xcite this limit is identified as the limit where spacetime nonsingularly pinches off and nothing remains , a bubble of nothing  @xcite .",
    "this instability is so severe that it renders all vacua to spontaneously tunnel to a state of no spacetime .",
    "thus , we conclude that all compactification with @xmath0 extra dimensions is quantum - mechanically unstable against decay to nothing .",
    "this is a genuine feature of einstein  born  infeld compactification that does not appear in the einstein  higgs theory .",

    "there even exists a critical limit of allowed extra dimensions above which the potential ceases to be real .",
    "we believe this is due to the square root form of the born  infeld term .",
