    "matroids are much studied objects in combinatorics , arising naturally whenever examining independence relations between objects . starting with a set of vectors in some vector space , it is natural to ask which vectors are independent of which other vectors .",
    "this is , in some sense , a measure of how badly our set of vectors fails to be a basis .",
    "the collection of independent subsets of some set of vectors is knows as a matroid .",
    "but matroids do nt only appear in connection to vector spaces .",
    "they can also be formed from the spanning trees of graphs , hyperplane arrangements or any other situation where there is some notion of `` independence '' ( with the natural assumption that a subset of an independent set is independent ) .",
    "all of these objects are matroids .",
    "since a subset of an independent set is independent , we can naturally regard a matroid as a simplicial complex .",
    "so , one way to study matroids is by looking at the simplicial complex formed by their independent sets ( defined in section  [ sec : basics ] ) and examining its combinatorial , topological and algebraic ( by way of the stanley - reisner ideal ) properties .",
    "the complexes that arise in this way are known as matroid complexes . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath2 is a simplicial complex over a finite set , we will consider one of its fundamental invariants , the _ @xmath3-vector _ , @xmath4 where each @xmath5 is the number of faces of @xmath2 with dimension @xmath6 .",
    "more algebraically , we also examine the @xmath0-vector , @xmath7 , which can be found from the hilbert function of the stanley - reisner ideal of @xmath2 .",
    "the two sequences are equivalent via the equations @xmath8 the algebraic study of matroid complexes was begun by stanley in @xcite where he referred to them as `` g - complexes '' .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for details on this and other basic facts about stanley - reisner ideals .",
    "the reader who is interested in the general theory of matroids may refer to one of the many books on the subject such as @xcite or @xcite .",
    "there are several classes of simplicial complexes whose @xmath0-vectors have been completely characterized .",
    "for example , stanley ( @xcite ) showed that the @xmath0-vectors of shellable complexes are exactly the @xmath9-sequences ( that is @xmath10 is the @xmath0-vector of an artinian monomial algebra ) and likewise for the cohen - macaulay complexes .",
    "the @xmath9-sequences are characterized numerically by macaulay .",
    "the independence complex of a matroid is both cohen - macaulay and shellable so we get necessary , but not sufficient , conditions for a given sequence to be the @xmath0-vector of a matroid complex .",
    "the ultimate goal is to characterize all possible @xmath0-vectors of matroid complexes and to prove the following , 30 year - old , conjecture of stanley @xcite .",
    "[ conj:1 ] the @xmath0-vector of a matroid complex is a pure @xmath9-sequence ( that is , the @xmath0-vector of a artinian monomial _ level _ algebra ) .",
    "this was shown for the case of `` cographic '' matroids by merino in @xcite and we prove it here for the case when @xmath11 .",
    "there is no known characterization of pure @xmath9-sequences .",
    "however , some necessary conditions are known beyond the requirement that the @xmath0-vector be an @xmath9-sequence . a theorem of brown and colbourn @xcite states that if @xmath0 is the @xmath0-vector of a matroid complex then @xmath12 for any @xmath13 with equality possible only if @xmath14 .",
    "relating to stanley s conjecture above , hibi ( @xcite ) showed that a pure @xmath15-sequence must satisfy @xmath16 and in @xcite conjectured that the same held for the @xmath0-vectors of matroid complexes .",
    "also in @xcite hibi proved the weaker claim that , for the @xmath0-vector of a matroid , @xmath17 for all @xmath18 and in @xcite chari proved hibi s conjecture in full .",
    "next , we have a result of swartz ( @xcite ) stating that if @xmath19 then @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "another proof of this result was given by hausel in @xcite , where he also shows these inequalities for pure @xmath9-sequences .",
    "these are the best results that the author is aware of .",
    "none of them are sufficient for a vector to be the @xmath0-vector of a matroid . for more information on what is known about pure @xmath9-sequences ,",
    "see @xcite .    as our main results we completely classify all matroid @xmath0-vectors for the case where @xmath11 ( or equivalently , rank 2 matroids ) in theorem  [ thrm:1d - binomial - h - vector ] .",
    "in fact we do somewhat more and describe combinatorially all 1-dimensional matroid complexes ( theorem  [ thrm : classify - matroids ] ) , associating each one to a partition of the number of vertices .",
    "this allows us to not only compute the @xmath0-vector , but also to count the number of 1-dimensional matroid complexes on a fixed vertex set . using these techniques",
    "we also obtain an algebraic description of the stanley - reisner ideal of 1-dimensional matroid complexes ( theorem  [ thrm:1d - sr - ideal ] ) which we use to provide a constructive proof of conjecture  [ conj:1 ] in this case .",
    "we define a _ simplicial complex _ , @xmath2 , over a set @xmath22 to be a subset of the power set of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) with that property that , whenever @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",

    "so , by induction on the number of vertices there is an isomorphism @xmath345 .",
    "since @xmath39 and @xmath341 must both be `` attached '' to their deletions in the same manner ( by the construction of @xmath271 ) this will lift to an isomorphism simply by mapping @xmath346 .",

    "from proposition  [ prop:1d - misc ] we see that a move directly down simply adds a 1 to the end of the partition .",
    "the diagonal moves are move complex .",
    "we may only apply these to partitions that contain a 1 ( we will assume it is written last ) .",
