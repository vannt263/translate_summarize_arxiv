    "pulsars emit over a wide range of energies from radio to @xmath0-ray .",
    "recent observations by the _",
    "fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope of more than sixty pulsars @xcite have revealed further details of the structure of the emission region .",
    "the detection of the emissions in the gev energy range from a pulsar magnetosphere means that electrons and positrons are accelerated to more than @xmath1ev by the electric field parallel to the magnetic field , which arises in a depleted region of the goldreich - julian charge density @xcite .",
    "the light curve in the @xmath0-ray band is an important tool for probing the particle acceleration and dissipation processes in the pulsar magnetosphere , since the maximum energy is determined by the acceleration - radiation - reaction - limit for typical energetic pulsars .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission region has therefore been explored by comparing theoretical models with the observed light curve(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsed emission is also detected in other energy bands ( x - ray , ultraviolet , optical and radio ) for some sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral features are non - thermal except for the soft x - ray range , and the light curves from a single object are , in general , different from one energy band to another . for example , profiles of the light curve in one spin period are different in the @xmath0- and x - ray ranges in the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "the peak phase of different energy range is expected to coincide , since the emitting particles are related to a pair cascade process .",
    "however , the observation shows that the phase depends on the energy bands .",
    "this means that their emission regions are not the same region .",
    "a complete understanding of light curve behavior in multi - wavelength bands can provide valuable information about the particle acceleration region .",
    "note that we do not discuss soft x - rays , which are believed to be thermal radiation from the neutron star surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "possible origins of non - thermal pulsed emissions have been considered in the polar cap @xcite , slot gap @xcite , and outer gap @xcite models .",
    "recent _ fermi _ observations with high @xmath0-ray photon number statistics have showed that the phase - averaged spectrum above 200  mev is well fitted by a power law plus exponential cutoff , and that a cutoff shape sharper than a simple exponential is rejected with high significance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this rules out the near - surface emission proposed in polar cap cascade models @xcite , which would exhibit a much sharp spectral cutoff due to magnetic pair - production attenuation .",
    "thus , pulsed @xmath0-ray emission originates in the outer magnetosphere , as considered in the outer gap model .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter tcs08 ) considered a three - dimensional geometrical emission model to fit the observed light curves at different energy bands .",
    "the model is extended with some model parameters from the calculated gap structure in a two - dimensional meridian plane . by comparing the light curves of the vela pulsar",
    ", they found that the x - ray emission is produced by both inward and outward emission from the gap region , and that uv / optical emission originates from secondary pairs at a higher altitude .",
    "the number of light curves of pulsars observed at @xmath0-ray and other energy bands is increasing thanks to _ fermi _ , so that it is worthwhile to investigate whether outer gap model is applicable to other sources .    in this paper , we investigate the emission regions of several pulsars by fitting the simplified model of tcs08 to the observed multi - wavelength light curves . in this model , we have to specify the locations of the upper and lower boundaries of the gap region where the non - corotation potential is zero .",
    "therefore , we explicitly introduce the altitude of the gap region as a parameter , in order to fit the observational data easily .",
    "the light curves also depend on the dipole inclination and viewing angles . in our method ,",
    "such parameters are eliminated by other observational data , and only the altitude is changed for the fitting . in the most studies , the lower boundary of the emission region is chosen as the surface of the last - open field lines of the rotating dipole(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) in this paper , however , the altitude is allowed to be in a wide range in order to explore the possible deviation of magnetic field - line structure from that of a rotating dipole in vacuum . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model assumptions and parameters . in section 3",
    ", we compare the peaks of light curves with those observed at multiple wavelengths , and determine the altitude parameter .",
    "our discussion is presented in section 4 , and lastly , a summary is given in section 5 .",
    "the numerical method for fitting the light curve is well described by @xcite and @xcite ; but we briefly summarize it in this section to explain one modification .",
    "our model is almost the same as that used by tcs08 .",
    "however , we explicitly introduce the altitude of the emission region as an additional parameter .",
    "we assume that magnetic field structure is approximately described by a rotating dipole with magnetic moment @xmath2 .",
    "the angular velocity is @xmath3 , and the magnetic axis is declined by an angle @xmath4 from the axis of rotation ( the z - axis ) .",
    "the magnetic moment changes with time @xmath5 as @xmath6 the magnetic field produced by the rotating dipole ( e.g. @xcite ) can be expressed using the retarded time @xmath7 as @xmath8 +   \\hat{\\bf r}\\biggl [ \\hat{\\bf r } \\cdot \\biggl(3\\frac{\\boldsymbol   { \\mu}(t_r)}{r^3 } + 3\\frac { \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(t_r)}{cr^2 } + \\frac {   \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(t_r)}{c^2r } \\biggr ) \\biggr ] , \\label{2.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is radial distance from the center of the star , and a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that radiation direction aligns with magnetic field in a frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath3 in which the electric field vanishes .",
    "physically , this means that the magnetosphere is filled with a co - rotation enforcing charge .",
    "the condition holds only within the light cylinder .",
    "the direction of particles in the lab frame is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 ^ 2 -   ( \\boldsymbol{\\omega }   \\times{\\bf r}/c)^2 + 1\\}^{1/2 } , \\label{2.5}\\ ] ] and @xmath12 is the unit vector along the magnetic field in lab frame .",
    "the particle velocity is highly relativistic , so we have made the approximation @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "thus the direction of radiation emitted tangential to the particle velocity vector is given by @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) .",
    "this direction is related to the periodic pulse phase .",
    "the observed phase @xmath15 is the sum of the azimuthal angle @xmath16 at the emission point and the relativistic time delay @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the emission point , and @xmath19 the light cylinder radius .",
    "a certain mechanism is needed to fix the lower boundary of the particle acceleration region . in most works , including tcs08 , the lower boundary is chosen as the surface of the last - open field lines of a rotating dipole in a vacuum .",
    "the field lines are calculated by eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) from the neutron star surface , and the last - open ones are defined as being just tangential to the light cylinder and they form a magnetic surface from the polar cap . the numerical procedure is described by @xcite in detail and we follow it . in the outer gap model , if particle acceleration occurs in an open zone , the curvature radiation from the accelerated particles forms a narrow cone along the magnetic field lines in a frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath0-ray photons are converted by colliding x - ray photons to @xmath20 pairs , which tend to screen the accelerating electric field . however , there is no supply of pairs on the last - open field lines and hence no screening of the electric field , since the @xmath0-ray photons are emitted only toward higher altitudes above the last - open field lines @xcite .",
    "the ` real ' last - open field lines may be different from ones in a vacuum @xcite .",
    "we therefore take into account this possible deviation of the boundary .",
    "we assume that dipole magnetic field is an approximation within the light cylinder and use eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) as the global magnetic field structure .",
    "even if the overall structure is not different so much , critical value between open and closed field lines is very sensitive to the boundary value at the surface .",
    "the `` real '' last - open field lines do not in general agree with those in vacuum field .",
    "thus we introduce a parameter , altitude of the emission region as a correction factor in order to take into account the deviation of boundary from the vacuum field . in our model",
    "this parameter specifies the range of the emission region which is located above or below the last - open field lines within the light cylinder radius .",
    "each different field line originating from the magnetic polar region is parameterized by magnetic colatitudes @xmath21 and azimuthal angles @xmath22 . following @xcite",
    ", we define open volume coordinates on the polar cap , ( @xmath23 , @xmath22 ) , where @xmath24 .",
    "the function @xmath25 is the magnetic colatitude of the conventional polar cap angle and generally depends on the magnetic azimuth @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 corresponds to the altitude of the emission region : the last - open field lines of a rotating dipole in a vacuum correspond to @xmath26 , whereas those for higher altitudes have @xmath27 .",
    "following @xcite , the maximum value is chosen as @xmath28 , which corresponds to the polar cap angle @xmath29 , obtained in the force - free limit by @xcite .",
    "we found that no significant caustics are formed in the sky map , even if the maximum value of @xmath23 is increased .",
    "we assume that the radiation of different energy bands is emitted from different field lines characterized by altitude .",
    "the field line relevant to the @xmath0- and x - rays is approximated as being the same one .",
    "the direction of the emission is tangential to the lines , and inward and outward directions are possible .",
    "both location and direction affect the light curve profile of the energy bands .",
    "following the model by tcs08 , the @xmath0-ray radiation above 100 mev is emitted by particles moving in an outward direction , whereas radiation at lower energy bands is emitted by those moving in both outward and inward directions .",
    "we use two conditions to constrain the emission region .",
    "first condition is the radial extension of the emission region .",
    "the outward emission is restricted to radial distances @xmath30 , and the inward one is restricted to @xmath31 .",
    "the outer boundary @xmath32 for inward emission comes from the results of dynamic model ( tcs08 ) , in which very few ingoing pairs are produced beyond the radial distance @xmath33 .",
    "second condition is the azimuthal extension of the emission region .",
    "we use the magnetic azimuthal angle of the footprint of field line ( i.e. , the point where magnetic field line penetrates the neutron star surface ) to characterize the field line for given @xmath23 .",
    "radial distance to the null charge surface on the field lines significantly depends on the magnetic azimuthal angle . in the outer gap model ,",
    "most of the pairs are created around the null surface ( tcs08 ) .",
    "we expect that the gap activity is related to the distance to the null surface .",
    "although the current density should be determined by global conditions , there is no study of the three - dimensional magnetosphere of an inclined rotator . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the field lines of both outward and inward emission are active only if the radial distance to null surface @xmath34 is shorter than @xmath19 .",
    "the azimuthal constraint is automatically satisfied for outward emission because the radial extension gives @xmath30 .",
    "however , for inward emission the condition becomes strong .",
    "the radial extension @xmath35 allows for the regions @xmath36 on the field lines with @xmath37 .",
    "they are not active , so that the corresponding regions should be excluded . the critical value @xmath32 was obtained by fitting to vela pulsar ( tcs08 ) .",
    "it is not straightforward to apply it to other sources .",
    "the mean free path @xmath38 of the pair creation process between the @xmath0-ray and thermal x - ray emissions from the stellar surface is estimated as @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the value at the null pointis @xmath40 found to be in a range of @xmath41-@xmath42 for our samples .",
    "our light curves especially peak positions are not changed even by adopting @xmath43 as the outer boundary for inward emission .",
    "spatial distribution of the emissivity is approximated by the step function - type , but the peak positions weakly depend on the detailed emissivity distribution .",
    "we assume that the overall structure of the light curve comes not from the emissivity distribution , but from a bunch of many field lines in the observation , that is , caustics .",
    "the appearance of caustics strongly depends on the observational viewing angle @xmath44 and the intensity distribution . in this paper , we focus on the peak phases of the light curve , so we adopt a simple , uniform emissivity along all magnetic field lines , which is independent of both the magnetic azimuthal angle @xmath45 and the altitude @xmath23 .",
    "the fitting does not completely reproduce the observations so , in section 4 , a simple improvement to the emissivity distribution is considered which leads to a much better fit .",
    "we now explain our fitting method . for fixed inclination angle @xmath46 and viewing angle @xmath44 , the light curve as a function of phase @xmath15 depends only on the altitude @xmath23 . the intensity is calculated in the range @xmath47 with a bin width of 0.02 .",
    "there are no significant caustics for large @xmath48 . in the observed light curve",
    ", the reference phase @xmath49 is assumed to be located at the radio emission peak maximum in most studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however in the model light curve , the conventional reference phase @xmath49 occurs when the magnetic axis , spin axis and earth line of sight lie all in the same plane .",
    "these two reference phases do not agree with each other since it is generally assumed that radio emissions arise at non - zero altitude in most empirical studies .",
    "following @xcite , we allow a shift by @xmath50 in the model reference rotation phase .",
    "this degree of freedom does not significantly affect the determination of the altitude parameter @xmath23 , because we use the peak separation in the observed @xmath0-ray and x - ray light curves which are emitted at the same @xmath23 .",
    "for the sources showing a double - peak pulse shape in the observed @xmath0-ray light curve , we use the peak separation . for those showing a single - peak",
    ", we use the phase separation between the @xmath0-ray peak and one of x - ray peaks .",
    "this is the benefit of considering @xmath0-ray and x - ray light curves simultaneously .",
    "subsequently , we look for the altitude of the uv / optical emission region using the @xmath0-ray upper limit of @xmath23 .",
    "in this section , we compare our model with pulse profiles observed at multiple wavelengths for seven pulsars .",
    "the sources are chosen using two criteria .",
    "one is that non - thermal pulses are detected in addition to the @xmath0-ray and radio bands .",
    "our concern is to explore whether or not the emission region for different energy bands is explained by the tcs08 model .",
    "the second criterion is that the geometrical parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath44 are observationally constrained by the relativistic doppler - boosted x - ray pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) @xcite or radio polarization data ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the torus fitting method constrains the viewing angle @xmath44 only .",
    "a small allowed range of @xmath51 is assumed for samples in which only @xmath44 is constrained due to the fact that radio emission from the pulsar polar region is detected .",
    "the geometrical parameters for the pulsars are listed in table 1 .",
    "we use these values , although there are some uncertainties in them .",
    "the results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig:3.1 ] and  [ fig:2.1 ] . fig .",

    "the upper and lower panels in fig .",
    "[ fig:2.1 ] are their pulse profiles for outward and inward emission in @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission regions .",
    "we start with the vela pulsar , which has been well studied to test the validity of our simple model .",
    "tcs08 considered this source , but they used geometric parameters that are slightly different from ours .",
    "pulse profiles have been detected in optical to @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "the observed pulse profile in @xmath0-ray band by _ fermi _ @xcite shows a prominent double - peak structure and bridge emission between the two peaks .",
    "the first and second peaks are located at the phases @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , and the separation is @xmath54 .",
    "we show the intensity map for outward emission as a function of the altitude of the emission region and rotation phase in upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](a ) . the emission altitude producing",
    "a peak separation @xmath54 is @xmath55 - 1.06 .    the x - ray data from _ rxte _ @xcite also shows a double - peak structure but the second peak broadens toward early phase .",
    "the calculated intensity map is shown for outward and inward emissions in the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](a ) .",
    "the main double peaks are located at the same phases as those in the @xmath0-ray band , so they are interpreted as being formed by outward emission .",
    "the broad component before the second peak at @xmath56 is associated with the caustic formed by the inward emission , as shown in the lower panel .",
    "we attempted a fit without the inward emission , but found that the inward emission is needed in order to reproduce the observed x - ray pulse profile .",
    "the necessity of inward emission was discussed in tcs08 .",
    "thus , the peak positions of @xmath0- and x - ray pulses can be explained with the same value of @xmath55 - 1.06 .",
    "the contour map , however , shows a minor peak at @xmath57 formed by the outward emission .",
    "the peak was not observed in the @xmath0-ray band .",
    "we compare our model with the uv data of @xcite and optical data of @xcite .",
    "the pulse profiles in both bands are very similar , that is , they have a double - peak structure at the same phases .",
    "the peak phases however differ from those of the @xmath0- and x - ray bands .",
    "the first peak of the uv / optical bands shifts to a later phase @xmath58 and the second peak shifts to an earlier phase @xmath59 , so that the peak separation becomes smaller .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](a ) that such a double - peak structure corresponds to @xmath60 - 0.80 for the outward emission .",
    "the corresponding inward emission can not be detected since its observable range is @xmath61 , as shown in the lower panel .",
    "the choice of outward emission with @xmath60 - 0.80 is also supported by the fact that the second peak at @xmath59 in the uv / optical ranges is sharper than the first one at @xmath62 , because of their different dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we have reproduced the pulse profiles of optical to @xmath0-ray bands by the caustics model without any detailed assumptions about emissivity . from the fitting model",
    ", we found three conditions for the emission region .",
    "( 1 ) the uv / optical emission region is located at an altitude above the @xmath0- and x - ray emission region of @xmath55 - 1.06 .",
    "( 2 ) there is a separation of altitude between the x - ray and optically dominant emission regions .",
    "( 3 ) the uv / optical emission range , @xmath63 , is broader than that of @xmath0/x - ray emission regions , @xmath64 .",
    "the pulsar psr j0659 + 1414 has also been observed in the @xmath0-ray to optical bands .",
    "we use the @xmath0-ray data from _ fermi _",
    "@xcite , x - ray data from _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , uv data from @xcite and optical data from @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data is a combination of thermal ( blackbody ) and non - thermal ( power - law ) emissions and is consistent with a cooling middle - aged neutron star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at soft x - rays ,",
    "the pulse fraction is low and the pulsations are sinusoidal , as is typical for thermal emissions from the surface of a neutron star with non - uniform temperature distribution . at higher energies ( @xmath651.5kev ) , where the non - thermal component dominates , the pulsed fraction increases and the profile becomes single peaked .",
    "we , therefore , consider the pulse profiles of hard x - rays ( @xmath651.5kev ) only .",
    "the pulse profile in the @xmath0-ray band shows a relatively broad single peak , which lags the radio maximum peak by @xmath660.2 in phase .",
    "the peak in the non - thermal x - ray pulse is at @xmath67 - 0.8 , which is different from the phase of the @xmath0-ray peak .",
    "this phase difference can not be ignored , although the peaks in the @xmath0- and x - ray data are rather broad , and hence the difference may be diminished somewhat by including the phase error .",
    "we interpret these pulse profiles as being emissions at different phases and different directions : the peak of @xmath0-ray is formed by outward emission , whereas that of x - ray is formed by inward emission .",
    "the intensity maps are given in the upper panel ( outward emission ) and lower panel ( inward emission ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](b ) , respectively . from this figure",
    ", we see that a peak separation @xmath68 between the @xmath0-ray and x - ray data corresponds to an emission altitude of @xmath69 - 1.14 by shifting the reference phase by @xmath70 to an earlier phase . the emission altitude",
    "can not be fixed without the x - ray data : a shift of peak phase is allowed , so @xmath23 is unknown .",
    "this ambiguity is removed by considering multi - wavelength light curves . from the intensity map",
    ", we expect another very sharp caustic at @xmath71 , but there is no counterpart in the @xmath0-ray observations ( top panel of fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss this missing peak in section 4.2 . in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "4 in @xcite , the light curve for inward emission is given .",
    "the x - ray data may be a combination of inward and outward emissions , but the x - ray profile observed by @xcite is similar to that of inward emission only .",
    "this means phenomenologically that outward emission of x - rays is weak in this source .",
    "the pulse profiles in the uv @xcite and optical bands @xcite are almost the same shape and have a clear double - peak structure unlike the single peak in the @xmath0- and x - ray bands .",
    "the first peak at @xmath72 is later than the @xmath0-ray peak and the second peak at @xmath73 is later phase than the x - ray peak . from the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](b ) , we see that the observed first peak can be reproduced by outward emission at an altitude @xmath74 . here",
    "we have a weak condition because the peak position depends only weakly on @xmath23 . for the second peak , the inward emission forms caustics for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the altitude of the emission region in the uv / optical bands is identified as @xmath76 - 1.04 , where the lower limit is set by a coarse bin of the phase in the observational data .",
    "@xcite have already investigated the multi - wavelength light curve of this pulsar using a similar method to ours , but could not explain the profile using geometrical parameters which are consistent with radio polarization data @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the lower boundary of the emission region was chosen as the last - open field lines in the vacuum dipole field , that is , @xmath77 . in our analysis , by allowing @xmath78 , the phase of peaks can be successfully fitted by using observed geometrical parameters .",
    "this suggests that the actual lower boundary of the gap is slightly different from the last - open field lines in a vacuum dipole .      the @xmath0-ray pulse profile observed by _ fermi _ @xcite shows a double - peak structure .",
    "the first peak is offset from the radio peak by @xmath79 , and the second is at @xmath80 .",

    "the observed x - ray pulse profile shows two peaks aligned in phase over a wide energy range of @xmath820.5 - 270 kev , and is also very similar to that of the @xmath0-ray band .",
    "we show the intensity maps for outward and inward emission in the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](c ) , respectively . as seen in the upper panel , the emission altitude for the double - peak with @xmath81",

    "such a solution is possible by choosing an emission altitude of @xmath91 - 1.02 with a small phase shift @xmath92 .",
    "the intensity map for inward emission shows a sudden decrease in the number counts for @xmath93 .",

    "the outward emission curve is very similar to the observations in the @xmath0- and x - ray bands . in this pulsar , we need to use all the light curves simultaneously in order to determine the range of @xmath23 .",
    "since emissions with smaller values of @xmath23 are not seen , if @xmath0-ray and optical emission regions are separated @xmath94 , similar to the vela pulsar and psr j0659 + 1414 , we predict that an optical pulse profile can not be observed or will be only very weakly detected .",
    "this is consistent with the fact there have been no reports of the detection of a pulse in the lower energy band for this pulsar .      the @xmath0-ray light curve from _ fermi _ @xcite shows a broad peak at @xmath87 - 0.5 .",
    "this peak may consist of two components , but it is not clear in the current photon statistics .",

    "recently , in the table of @xcite they list this object as non - thermal dominated source in x - ray . the pulsed x - ray profile is likely to originate from the non - thermal component .",

    "the first peak is offset from the radio peak by @xmath100 and the two peaks are separated by @xmath101 .",
    "the x - ray light curve in @xcite shows a relatively sharp peak associated with first peak in the @xmath0-ray light curve albeit with weak photon statistics . in this paper",
    ", we assume that at least the first peak is non - thermal in origin . the possible contribution of non - thermal x - ray emissions is also discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we expect that this assumption will be tested by phase - resolved spectra from future observations .    as seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](f ) , the emission altitude is @xmath83 - 0.98 , for which there is a @xmath0-ray double - peak profile with separation @xmath102 and a relative shift @xmath103 toward later phase .",
    "the peak of non - thermal emission at @xmath104 - 0.20 in the x - ray light curve is found to be formed by outward emission only .",
    "the relatively weak second peak in the x - ray band is consistent with the case of psr j0205 + 6449 .",
    "thus , the three model parameters for this pulsar and psr j0205 + 6449 are very similar , as shown in table 1 .      the @xmath0-ray light curve from _ fermi _ @xcite shows a broad peak at @xmath105 - 0.65 .",
    "this probably consists of two components , but it is not clear .",
    "@xcite extract only a power - law component of the x - ray light curve and their fig .",
    "13 shows a two peaks at @xmath87 - 0.3 and @xmath106 - 1.0 , although the data are very coarse .",
    "we regard the light curve as being produced by a non - thermal x - ray component .",
    "the observed light curve may be regarded either as a broad peak consisting of weak peaks and a relatively bright bridge emission or as a result of the range of the emission region widening towards lower altitudes . in the latter interpretation",
    "the fitted @xmath23 is only a lower limit .",
    "we thus focus on the width of the @xmath0-ray peak . from the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](g ) , the emission altitude is @xmath107 - 0.94 even if we assume a double - peak structure with the first peak at @xmath108 and the second peak at @xmath109 following @xcite , we have @xmath1100.90 - 0.91 , which is very similar to the value obtained above .",
    "thus we have @xmath1100.90 - 0.95 in either case .",
    "the phase shift is @xmath99 in this pulsar .",
    "the first peak in the x - ray light curve is formed by outward emission , but the second one can not be produced for the same altitude .",
    "this may be a drawback to our model , but the present x - ray data are coarse and a much more precise non - thermal x - ray light curve is needed .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the peak phases of seven pulsars emitting @xmath0- and x - rays can be successfully fitted using the tcs08 outer gap model , in which both @xmath0-rays and x - rays originate from the same magnetic field line characterized by an altitude @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath111 is needed in the light curve fitting for some sources . moreover",
    ", the inclusion of inward emission for x - rays causes a variety of pulse profiles in both bands .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 could not be determined solely using @xmath0-ray data for a single @xmath0-ray peak pulsar .",
    "but , by considering the x - ray light curve , the parameter is uniquely determined for psrs j0659 + 1414 , j2229 + 6114 and j1420 - 6048 .",
    "it is worthwhile to explore the general dependence of the altitude @xmath23 on other characteristics if any , although there may not be enough data for a proper statistical analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] , @xmath23 is plotted as a function of inclination angle @xmath4 , spin - down luminosity @xmath112 , characteristic age @xmath113 and surface dipole magnetic field @xmath114 .",
    "we found that there is a significant correlation between @xmath23 and the inclination angle @xmath4 only ; the relations of @xmath23 with the other parameters are very weak .",
    "this correlation suggests that the deviation from a vacuum rotating dipole field is large for small inclination angle .",
    "it is very interesting to compare this result with that in a force - free magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite proposed that the separatrix layer at an altitude of 0.90 - 0.95 times the height of the last - open field line is relevant to emissions in a three - dimensional inclined force - free magnetosphere .",
    "this altitude , which is not exactly symmetric with respect to the magnetic azimuthal angle @xmath22 , but can be approximated by the value at @xmath115 , is plotted in fig .  [ fig:4.2 ] as purple downward and blue upward triangles .",
    "two linear fitting lines are also shown .",
    "the altitude @xmath23 decreases with the inclination angle @xmath4 in both our model and the separatrix layer model of a force - free magnetosphere .",
    "however , the emission region in the separatrix layer model extends even outside the light - cylinder , whereas ours is well localized around null points .",
    "accounting for this difference may be important for further improvement of the model of the emission region based on a force - free magnetosphere .",
    "the thickness of the gap region , @xmath116 , is not known , but it is sometimes assumed to decrease with the spin - down luminosity @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath118 , if the lower boundary of the gap is fixed as the last - open field line in the vacuum dipole field .",
    "this assumption is tested in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] , in which the relation @xmath119 is plotted as a light green curve .",
    "( the curve is not fitted to the data points . )",
    "this suggests that the assumption of maximum altitude , @xmath77 , is not a good one .",
    "this discovery affects expected number of the @xmath0-ray pulsars in the observation . from geometrical reason , the pulsed emission by caustics is limited to a certain range between inclination and viewing angles .",
    "@xcite showed the range of observable pulsars with @xmath1200.95 , 0.90 and 0.70 for outer gap model in their fig .",
    "we recalculate it and show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.3 ] .",
    "the observable range of viewing angle @xmath44 is below the curves .",
    "our finding in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] is that @xmath23 is a function of the inclination angle , which is similar to that of the separatrix layer model .",
    "we also show the observable range by the empirical relation obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] as black solid line , for which the altitude is chosen as 0.925 times the height of the last - open field line in force - free magnetosphere .",
    "the figure shows that sources with low inclination and viewing angles become observable .",
    "for example , pulsar with the inclination angle @xmath121 can be detected for @xmath122 for @xmath1200.95 , but for @xmath123 .",
    "thus expected number increases approximately twice for sources with the low inclination and viewing angles .",
    "the caustic model considered in section 3 provides peak positions consistent with observation , but there are also some additional , unseen peaks .",
    "these are interpreted as being prohibited by some mechanism . in this section",
    ", we consider an improvement to our model that takes into account a very simple distribution for the emissivity .",
    "detectable @xmath0-rays are radiated with large multiplicity by the pair plasma in the gap region .",
    "therefore , the mean free path of a @xmath0-ray photon should be less than light cylinder radius @xcite .",
    "the pair creation mean free path is given by @xmath124 @xcite for an assumed limiting distance to the null point @xmath125 .",
    "the position of the null point of inclined pulsars , where the accelerating electric field arises , depends significantly on magnetic azimuthal angle , so the intensity of @xmath0-ray emission also depends on the magnetic azimuthal angle .",
    "therefore , active field lines should be limited in the azimuthal direction . by taking into account the azimuthal extensions with @xmath126 listed in table 1 ,",
    "the fits of the resultant light curves , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.1 ] , become better . in the same figure",
    ", we also show the radial distance to the emission points of the observed photons against the rotation phase .",
    "note that , for the vela pulsar , the minor third peak at @xmath57 still remains even after the inclusion of the azimuthal extension limit .",
    "the corresponding radial distance of emission points is relatively large , so that the photon energy is expected to be soft .",
    "the third peak is not observed in the gev band , but may appear in a much lower energy band .",
    "at least , the minor third peak of the x - ray light curve appears to be associated with the same caustic .",
    "we have also tried to improve the x - ray light curve with some other simple assumptions , but have not had good results .",
    "the reason for this is that there are many ways for x - ray emitting particles to be created : via thermal , magnetospheric emissions and magnetic pair creation .",
    "therefore , the three - dimensional effect of the propagation of @xmath0-ray photons and soft x - ray photons is very important . without it",
    "we can not successfully explain the light curve .",
    "we explored the uv / optical emission region for vela and psr j0659 + 1414 .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar : the altitude range of uv / optical emission , @xmath127 , is broader than that for @xmath0- and x - rays , @xmath128 ; and both emission regions are not continuous and connected , but are widely separated .",
    "the separation may come from two competing mechanisms : a decrease of emissivity and an increase of synchrotron intensity in the uv / optical bands with altitude .    as discussed in tcs08 , outward emission is generally dominant in uv / optical emission , as shown in their fig .",
    "the explanation is the following .",
    "the number of created pairs is the main cause of the difference between inward and outward emissions in the uv / optical bands , since the collision angles with magnetospheric x - rays are not different for outgoing and ingoing @xmath0-ray photons in the acceleration region .",
    "more outgoing @xmath0-rays are emitted , and hence more outgoing secondary pairs are produced .",
    "thus , the synchrotron emission for outgoing secondary pairs produced by magnetic x - rays is brighter than that for the ingoing secondary pairs .",
    "the observed flux strongly depends on the geometrical configuration .",
    "the outward emission in the uv / optical bands may not point toward us even though the intrinsic emission is strong .",
    "our results show that the peaks in the vela pulsar can be explained by outward emission alone , while those in psr j0659 + 1414 require both inward and outward emissions .",
    "our result suggests that outward emission is significantly suppressed in psr j0659 + 1414 , to the level of the intrinsically weak inward emissions .",
    "the stronger component is hidden , because the observable altitude range is narrow , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.1](b ) .",
    "this may explain the fact that uv / optical flux is smaller than the value extrapolated from non - thermal x - rays , as seen fig .  4 of @xcite , whereas the flux coincides with the extrapolation in the vela pulsar .",
    "this interpretation may be tested in psr j1057 - 5226 .",
    "we also suggest that this difference is the reason why psr j0659 + 1414 , which has similar geometrical parameters to the vela pulsar , has an observable optical spectrum @xcite , and the flux is slightly smaller than the extrapolation from non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "the pulse profile has not yet been determined , but the peaks should appear at a phase 0.3@xmath129 and be due to outward emission .",
    "we have calculated the light curves of emissions using the tcs08 outer gap model and compared them with observed multi - wavelength light curves .",
    "we find that the model can successfully explain the peak positions of multi - wavelength light curves . in order to determine the altitude of the emission region ,",
    "the observed x - ray light curve is important , especially when there is a single peak in the @xmath0-ray light curve .",
    "the fit of a light curve based on a simple emissivity distribution can be improved by taking into account the limitation of azimuthal extension in which a reasonable value of the @xmath0-ray photon mean free path is adopted .",
    "the resulting difference between model and observed @xmath0-ray light curves becomes small ; however , there may still be an unseen peak , such as the minor third peak in vela .",
    "the best - fit values of the altitude of the emission region for psrs j0659 + 1414 and j1420 - 6048 , suggest a deviation from the last - open field lines of a vacuum dipole field .",
    "the real last - open field lines lie inside those of vacuum dipole field , @xmath130 .",
    "this shift suggests that the lower boundary is very similar to that of a force - free magnetosphere .",
    "we find that the altitude of the emission region is correlated with inclination angle .",
    "this relationship is also very similar to that in a force - free magnetosphere .",
    "the lower boundary of emission region has been assumed to @xmath26 so far , but our model fits do not support it .",
    "this modification of the boundary of the magnetosphere suggests that the pulsars with low inclination and viewing angles are likely to be detectable .",
    "thus the expected number in the future observation in the previous works(@xcite ) is underestimated for the sources with low inclination and viewing angles .",
