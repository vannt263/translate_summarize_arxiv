    "1999 ) has been substantially increased .",
    "these samples have recently been joined by radio galaxy identifications which reach @xmath0 ( van breugel et al .  1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "at the highest redshifts now probed , identification of galaxies basically relies on two key diagnostics : the lyman break across the continuum and the redshifted ly@xmath1 line .",
    "both characteristics have been used to select and to verify high-@xmath9 galaxy candidates .",
    "the extremely faint nature of the high-@xmath9 galaxy population in infrared continuum light and the increasing strength and frequency of nightsky emission lines at very long wavelengths makes it clear that the contrast and detection of high - redshift galaxies from the ground is challenging , even for the new generation of 8- to 10-m class telescopes .",
    "the discovery of very high equivalent width emitters at @xmath10 ( hu & mcmahon 1996 ) indicated the existance of a substantial population of strong ly@xmath1 emitters which could be observed to very high redshifts , beyond @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we report on the status of ongoing ly@xmath1 emission - line searches combined with color - selection data and consider the prospects for future identifications at the very high redshift end .",
    "the ly@xmath1 searches are designed to address issues of detectability of field galaxies at very high redshifts , using the increased contrast of the object against the background sky when viewed in the ly@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the contrast of emission features against the neighboring continuum is also enhanced by the @xmath11 magnification of line widths , producing high equivalent width signatures . through the use of spectral regions free of strong night sky lines ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) , these studies are also designed to address object statistics over a range of different redshift intervals , since our ability to detect and reliably confirm very high - redshift galaxies is otherwise highly dependent on the location of emission features with respect to background nightsky lines .",
    "narrowband ly@xmath1 searches combined with deep multi - color data on the hawaii survey fields and hdf have been used as a training set ( cowie & hu 1998 ; hu 1998 ) to test emission line identifications in terms of color and equivalent width diagnostics over an extensive spectroscopic database , starting at @xmath12 , where color selection is robust , and working out to successively higher redshifts ( @xmath13 )",
    ". this allows studying continuity in properties of genuine ly@xmath1 emitters and both color - selected galaxies and low - redshift foreground emitters at progressively longer wavelengths , where higher sky backgrounds from the increased density of strong nightsky lines and fainter continua for the more distant galaxies are issues .",
    "a variant approach is to use a fabry - perot ( calar alto deep imaging survey , meisenheimer et al.1998 ) , which requires a high - level of precision in low - level light processing and flat - fielding .",
    "the present ly@xmath1 surveys have reached @xmath14 ( hu et al .",
    "1999 ) , and @xmath2 narrowband studies have recently been started .    from the initial wide - field narrowband surveys for ly@xmath1 emitters at @xmath15 and 4.5 ,",
    "hu et al .  (",
    "1998 ) estimated a surface density of ly@xmath1 emitters of @xmath16 down to an emission flux of @xmath17 ergs @xmath18 sec@xmath19 .",
    "these estimates were found to be consistent with a complementary deep spectroscopic study , where the slit provided limited spatial sampling , but wide wavelength coverage at somewhat greater sensitivity , and recovered 4 ly@xmath1 emitters with redshifts from @xmath20 .",
    "preliminary results from the @xmath21 searches suggest number densities perhaps a factor of 6 lower than the value for the lower redshift systems given by hu et al .",
    "the surface number density estimates for ly@xmath1 emitters imply that sufficiently deep spectroscopic exposures may intercept some of these systems , at least over the lower redshift ranges .",
    "in fact , the first published @xmath0 galaxy , rd-1 , was a serendipitously discovered ly@xmath1 emitter at @xmath22 reported by dey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) during deep long - slit observations of a neighboring object in the field , with both emission line and break identified in the spectra , and with the break confirmed by broad - band filter imaging . for rd-1 , estimates of the continuum magnitude above the lyman break are @xmath23 ab mags using the broad - band imaging data , with emission - line flux = @xmath24 ergs @xmath18 s@xmath19 , @xmath25   ( dey et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the success of the spectroscopic searches depends on the surface number density at the redshifts and fluxes being probed .",
    "equivalent width estimates , and particularly continuum magnitudes for faint objects measured in dispersed modes have larger associated errors than estimates tied to standard broadband filter photometry .",
    "higher sensitivities trade off against small area coverage , and for slit spectroscopy there is the additional issue of whether with chance superpositions sample objects fall only partly within the slit .",
    "the additional problem in using this method as a search technique is that it is difficult to assess the fraction of emitters missed because they lie in regions of strong nightsky lines , and that for such cases confirming observations can be extremely hard to make .",
    "an interesting variant of this search technique is to use slitless spectroscopy",
    "( chen et al .  1999 ) . incomplete object sampling by a slit is removed , but the general problem of overlapping galaxy spectra must be dealt with . using extremely deep stis parallel exposures from hst ,",
    "chen et al .  ( 1999 ) identify a ly@xmath1 emitter at a probable redshift of 6.68 . at @xmath26 ly@xmath1",
    "falls in regions of strong oh lines , which makes confirmation with ground - based observations extremely challenging .",
    "the strong depression of the continuum below the redshifted lyman break caused by the numerous neutral hydrogen absorbers dubbed `` the ly@xmath1 forest '' is the most notable feature in the galaxy continuum light of very high redshift systems , where the extreme faintness of these objects , typically @xmath27 mags ( ab ) above the break , precludes the use of detailed absorption features to estimate the redshift .",
    "this method has been most successfully applied ( e.g. , fernndez - soto et al .  1999 ) in the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , where the high precision of the photometric measurements permits robust detection of a break signature , and where the availability of photometric data at longer wavelengths ( nicmos infrared observations ) allows discrimination of lyman break galaxies from red objects .",
    "hdf 4 - 473.0 ( weymann et al .  1998 ) , shown to be a ` @xmath28 dropout ' by the absence of detectable flux in the wfpc2 f606w filter , combined with a roughly flat @xmath29 spectrum out through 1.6@xmath30 m , was confirmed as a @xmath31 galaxy through deep lris spectra on keck .",
    "an emission line with flux @xmath32 ergs @xmath18 s@xmath19 and @xmath33  , identified as ly@xmath1 , was used to establish the redshift .",
    "the magnitude above the break is @xmath34 ab mags .    a second color selected target , hdf 3 - 951.1 and 3 - 951.2 , was identified by the color break , and placed at an estimated redshift @xmath22 ( spinrad et al .  1998 ) on the basis of the break location .",
    "for this close pair , no emission features are detected ( fig .  2 of spinrad et al .",
    "1998 ) , with upper limits on possible ly@xmath1 more than a factor of 10 below the observed flux of hdf 4 - 473.0 spinrad et al .",
    "( 1998 ) consider the possibility that the absence of ly@xmath1 emission might be associated with its brighter continuum . because studies at this depth and precision of color measurement are only available for a small region of sky ( @xmath35 arcsec@xmath36 each for the hdf and hdf south ) , key questions one would like to address from the hdf color - break selected galaxies are : ( 1 ) how typical are these properties of the high - redshift galaxies ; what are the consequences for future detections ?",
    "( 2 ) are the bright high - redshift galaxies devoid of ly@xmath1 emission ?",
    "figs .  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] show images and a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the @xmath37 galaxy , ssa22-hcm1 ( hu et al .",
    "this object is an ` @xmath38 ' dropout , and is notably absent in deep keck lris images in @xmath39 , @xmath28 , and @xmath38 , which reach @xmath40 limits of @xmath39=28.3 , @xmath28=28.2 , and @xmath41 for a @xmath42 diameter aperture .",
    "the sed shows both the strong lyman break and the ly@xmath1 emission feature ( flux=@xmath43 ergs @xmath18 s@xmath19 ; @xmath44 = 175  ) , which was confirmed with deep lris spectroscopy .",
    "the increased contrast in the appearance of the object as detected in the 8185   narrowband filter compared with the line - free @xmath4 band filter around 9200   may be noted . for these measurements we use fluxes measured in the narrowband filter , instead of values recovered from spectroscopic extractions , for greater precision .",
    "aperture 1@xmath45 errors are estimated from laying down random apertures away from identified sources , since in the deep exposures magnitude limits are set by the background faint source population ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the measured continuum above the break , 25.5 mags ( ab ) , is a magnitude higher than the weymann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed estimate for hdf 4 - 473.0 , and lies between our estimated continuum magnitudes of 24.9 and 25.7 ( based on our deep @xmath4 band observations of the hdf ) for the 3 - 951 pair .",
    "ssa22-hcm1 is the brightest of the @xmath46 ly@xmath1 emitters surveyed to date , and in contrast to 3 - 951 has strong emission .",
    "however , it appears that more typical emitters at these redshifts have properties like 4 - 473.0 ( hu et al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "we can summarize the expected properties for ly@xmath1-emitting galaxies above @xmath47 , based on the current @xmath48 survey , as : ly@xmath1 fluxes @xmath32 ergs @xmath18 s@xmath19 , equivalent widths of a few 100  , and continuum magnitudes fainter than @xmath49 .",
    "efforts to model the high - redshift emitters have begun ( e.g. , thommes 1998 , haiman & spaans 1999 ) , and we can use these as a starting point to estimate the detection limits that will be required for working at higher redshifts . fig .  [ fig:3 ] from thommes ( 1998 ) shows the expected surface number density of ly@xmath1 emitters for four redshift intervals ( @xmath50 ) corresponding to spectral regions free of strong nightsky lines .",
    "overplotted are the data from cowie & hu ( 1998 ) for @xmath51 , and other upper limits .",
    "it can be seen that , in agreement with the properties summarized above , surveys will need to exceed @xmath52 detection limits of @xmath53 ergs @xmath18 s@xmath19 ( @xmath54 w m@xmath55 ) , and preferably cover wide areas .",
    "because ssa22-hcm1 is so bright in @xmath4 it is interesting to examine color statistics for objects in ( @xmath56 ) vs. @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the color distribution of objects in the hdf and ssa22 fields over a sample area of 75 arcmin@xmath36 .",
    "magnitudes are measured on the ab system using @xmath42 diameter corrected apertures .",
    "the fiducial color boundary used here of @xmath57 lies marginally above the range of possible m star contaminants , which might be distinguished by compactness criteria . at faint magnitudes",
    "the depth of the @xmath38 exposure dominates the errors in the @xmath3 color measurement , which can be quite large .",
    "filled symbols indicate known @xmath0 galaxies ( or in the case of hdf 3 - 395.1 and 3 - 395.2 , the summed magnitudes of the object pair ) . in the case of hdf 4 - 473.0",
    ", the colors are estimated from deep wfpc2 and nicmos photometry ( weymann et al .",
    "the @xmath52 @xmath4 band criterion is not sufficiently deep to include ssa22-hcm1 , the @xmath31 galaxy hdf 4 - 473.0 , or the @xmath22 emission - line galaxy rd1 ( based on the estimated @xmath58 ) , but the threshold is only a few tenths of a magnitude from reaching the brighter two objects .",
    "thus , it appears that the use of deep @xmath4-band filter imaging and @xmath56 color selection on the large telescopes may be a possible way to extend methods for selecting candidates to higher ( @xmath59 ) redshifts for ground - based studies , although the background sky brightness near 9200   is high .",
    "this could be used in combination with a near - ir color measurement to distinguish break objects from highly reddened galaxies .",
    "the new @xmath60 quasars discovered by the sloan survey ( fan et al .  1999 ) provide a means of evaluating the expected continuum depression below the ly@xmath1 line at high redshifts . because of the rapid increase in the gas density with redshift , it is expected that , at the higher redshifts , there will be a sizable break . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we show a spectrum of the newly discovered @xmath6 quasar , j033829.31 + 002156.3 , for which we determine a factor of 4 break across the emission line . by comparison , zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find , at @xmath61 , for @xmath62 , @xmath63  and a haardt - madau ( 1996 ) spectrum and ionizing flux , that the spectrum of a @xmath61  quasar will have an average flux in the region between @xmath64   and @xmath65   that is 10% of the continuum value which would be present in the absence of lyman alpha scattering . a plot of the continuum break across ly@xmath1 for various @xmath8 quasars ( schneider et al .",

    "it is useful to consider possible directions for future studies .",
    "a number of @xmath8 galaxies have been found using cluster lens systems ( e.g. , trager et al .  1997 , franx et al .  1997 , frye & broadhurst 1998 , pell et al .  1999 ) , where amplification of the source has increased its detectability . in general , such discoveries do not provide information on the statistics , continuum magnitudes , and base emission - line fluxes of the high - redshift galaxies found , but for very well - studied cluster lens systems ( e.g. , bzecourt et al .",
    "1999 ) it may be possible to recover such information .",
    "typical magnification is about 1 magnitude ( smail et al .",
    "1999 ) , and this may be a fruitful way to extend high - redshift searches .    the availability of new ir spectrographs for the 810-m .",
    "class telescopes will make it possible to study [ o ] associated with the @xmath68 systems ( e.g. egami 1997 ) .",
    "such observations may provide more information on the degree of dust extinction in the high - redshift galaxies detected by their ly@xmath1 .",
    "however , for @xmath0 systems [ o ] lies in the thermal ir and can not be readily studied from the ground .    for redshifts @xmath0 , high equivalent width h@xmath1 emission from high ionization foreground extragalactic h regions",
    "is a possible contaminant which can mimic ly@xmath1 .",
    "such systems may have no detectable continuum , and [ n ] suppressed to less than 2% of h@xmath1 ( stockton & ridgway 1998 ) .",
    "the incidence of these systems is not known , but a few cases have been encountered in our @xmath21 and @xmath2 surveys  and identified by wide wavelength spectra covering the corresponding [ o ] and [ o ] . extensive wavelength coverage is required to verify sources as ly@xmath1 emitters .",
    "searches for yet higher @xmath9 galaxies are of necessity forced into the near ir since the light below @xmath69  will be essentially extinguished by the strong ly  @xmath1  forest blanketing or by h  i gunn - peterson ( miralda - escud & rees 1998 ) at the redshifts where the igm was neutral .",
