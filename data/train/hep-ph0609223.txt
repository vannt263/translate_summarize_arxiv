    "<S> it should be noted that the isospin non - conserving decays are much weaker than the radiative decays , as expected intuitively above . </S>",

    "<S> thus , assigning @xmath0 to an iso - singlet state ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath89 molecule ) is disfavored by experiments .    from the above considerations , it is natural to assign @xmath0 to the iso - triplet @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , its neutral and doubly charged partners , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , have not yet been observed  @xcite . with this in mind , we study the production of charm - strange scalar mesons ( @xmath95 and @xmath91 ) by assigning @xmath0 to @xmath96 , and discuss why experiments have observed @xmath0 but not its neutral and doubly charged partners . to this aim , we consider their production through weak interactions as a possible mechanism , because the ozi - rule violating productions of multi-@xmath97-pairs and their recombinations into four - quark meson states are believed to be strongly suppressed at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> first , we recall that color mismatched decays which include rearrangements of colors in weak decay processes would be suppressed compared with color favored ones as long as non - factorizable contributions , which are actually small in @xmath4 decays and are expected to be much smaller at higher energies , are ignored . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] [ fig : via - c - cbar ]    because there is no diagram yielding @xmath93 production in this approximation , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 , it is easy to understand why no evidence of @xmath93 was found in @xmath3 experiments . as will be seen in productions of @xmath99 $ ] in the @xmath4 decays , their observed rates are comparable with color mismatched decays , so that rates for @xmath94 and @xmath91 productions in @xmath3 annihilation will be expected to be comparable with that through the color suppressed ones . </S>",
