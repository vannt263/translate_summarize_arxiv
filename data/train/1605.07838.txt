    "the corner stone for the successful description of experiments with microscopic systems as statistical experiments was laid by bohr through his probabilistic reading of the square modulus of the wavefunction , finally leading to the so called copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this interpretation of quantum mechanics is often also termed orthodox , to stress the existence of alternative viewpoints , still compatible with present day most refined experiments on the foundations of quantum mechanics ( see e.g. the special issue @xcite ) .",
    "further developments have deepened and strengthened the understanding of quantum mechanics as a theory describing experiments in a statistical framework . in this spirit",
    "it has become clear that quantum mechanics naturally leads to a new probabilistic description with respect to the classical one , sometimes termed quantum probability @xcite , so that from now on we will use the general term quantum theory , even though it actually started as an alternative to classical mechanics .",
    "quantum theory includes and extends the classical probabilistic description , so that bringing over ideas and concepts from classical probability theory through the quantum border is a fruitful path in order to further understand and explore the statistical structure of quantum theory , and  leads to a reach variety of new phenomena ( for a presentation of quantum theory along these lines see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "actually it is an amusing , and possibly telling , coincidence the fact that the book in which von neumann laid the mathematical foundations of quantum theory @xcite appeared almost at the same time as the contribution in which kolmogorov laid the foundations of classical probability theory basing its axiomatic presentation on measure theory @xcite .    the copenhagen interpretation , which tells us that the quantum description of physical systems brings with itself an intrinsic statistical aspect , can equally well describe composite systems , that is a situation in which one can distinguish between different parts of the overall system .",
    "let us call system the subset of degrees of freedom we are interested in and can access experimentally , as well as environment the other degrees of freedom , still to be described with the aid of quantum theory .",
    "a relevant and interesting question is the quantum prediction for the dynamics of the relevant degrees of freedom we call system if one does not or can not observe the environmental degrees of freedom . in such a situation , on top of the in principle unavoidable statistical aspect due to the very nature of quantum theory , an additional source of randomness appears , which can be termed quantum noise @xcite .",
    "this situation can be seen as the analogue of what happens in a classical setting when a given system undergoes a stochastic dynamics .",
    "however , in the classical case the dynamics of a small isolated system is in principle deterministic , and the statistical aspect in the description can always be seen as arising from the effect of a classical noise , possibly effectively describing the interaction with other classical degrees of freedom . in the quantum setting the action of quantum noise on the contrary builds on the original statistical description . besides this",
    ", important constraints on the structure of the equations describing the quantum stochastic dynamics as well as on the properties of the quantum noise itself appear , essentially related to the non commutativity of observables , playing the role of random variables in quantum theory , and to the tensor product structure of the hilbert space on which composite systems are described .",
    "it is to be stressed that quantum noise , or actually more precisely noise in a quantum system , can describe a phenomenon which is typical of the quantum realm , namely decoherence .",
    "the latter can be understood as the dynamical loss of the capability to show up quantum interference effects in a given system basis , as a consequence of the interaction with other external quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "we recall that the term decoherence or dephasing is sometimes also used to describe more generically a loss of coherence or visibility which can be obtained within a classical description .",
    "as a result quantum noise can induce an effective classical dynamics for certain system observables , still not selecting a definite outcome so that it does not lead to a solution of the measurement problem .",
    "an interesting issue within the description of randomness in the dynamics of a quantum system is also the distinction between noise which can be avoided by means of a more refined control or noise which is actually intrinsic to the quantum description @xcite .",
    "most recently an approach has also been suggested @xcite in order to discriminate between decoherence arising from an actual interaction with unobserved degrees of freedom and decoherence arising from modifications of quantum mechanics as suggested by collapse models or other alternative theories .    in this contribution",
    "we will briefly describe the emergence of a dynamics driven by quantum noise in the framework of open quantum system theory , considering basic examples .",
    "let us consider the general framework of open quantum system dynamics @xcite , introducing a quantum system described on the hilbert space @xmath0 , interacting with a quantum environment living in @xmath1 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : oqs ] .",
    "if we denote with @xmath2 the total state and describe the interaction by means of the unitary operators @xmath3 acting on @xmath4 , further assuming that the state at the initial time is factorized @xmath5 , we have that the reduced state of the system , describing the dynamics of the system s observables only , is given by @xmath6 the assignment @xmath7 turns out to define a map which is in particular completely positive , that is remains positive when extended to act on a tensor product extension of the considered hilbert space @xmath0 .    in many situations of interest the reduced system state dynamics",
    "is well described by a time - local master equation of the form @xmath8 where the superoperator @xmath9 is know as generators of the dynamics . for the case",
    "in which this superoperator is actually time independent , according to a famous result @xcite it is known to have the so called gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad form @xmath10 + \\sum_{j , k } a_{jk }",
    "\\left [ l_{j } \\rho_{s } ( t )    l_{k}^{\\dag } - \\frac{1}{2 } \\ { l_{k}^{\\dag }",
    "l_{j } , \\rho_{s } ( t ) \\ } \\right ]    { } , \\label{eq : lind } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a self - adjoint operator on the space of the system and the matrix @xmath12 has to be positive . in particular",
    "together with the system operators @xmath13 this matrix defines the details of the system - environment interaction and depends on the quantum correlation functions of the environment .",
    "properties of the quantum noise affecting the open system dynamics are therefore encoded in the operator structure of the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : lind ] ) , as well as in the features of correlation functions of quantum operators , as we shall see in the examples .",
    "the situation described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lind ] ) corresponds to a semigroup dynamics for the open quantum system , which can be considered markovian , in the sense that the state of the system at a given time is enough to determine it at later times .",
    "actually the proper definition of what should be considered as non - markovian dynamics in a quantum framework , and therefore also of non - markovian quantum noise , has newly become the object of an extensive research activity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the strategy that we have here briefly outlined is certainly not the only approach to the description of quantum noise arising within the copenhagen interpretation by the interaction of the system with other unobserved quantum degrees of freedom , for the presentation of other viewpoints and techniques see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a crucial point to stress is the measurement character of such time evolution , at variance with a standard unitary dynamics .",
    "indeed as it has been shown within the framework of continuous measurement theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) , such a dynamics can be obtained as a result of measurements performed on the side of the system , and can be described introducing non commuting noises .",
    "a thorough quantum description of noise allows in particular the preservation of basic features of quantum mechanics , such as e.g. heisenberg s commutation relations @xcite , which are generally not accounted for in phenomenological models which can be used to describe a stochastic dynamics .      for the sake of example we will now briefly consider two quantum dynamics which can be addressed within the previously introduced framework , and",
    "show how quantum noise can induce decoherence on the system degrees of freedom , determined by the environmental correlation functions .",
    "let us first consider a massive quantum particle interacting through collisions with a background ideal quantum gas .",
    "in such a setting for a sufficiently dilute gas memory effects can be safely neglected , so that indeed the dynamics can be taken to be markovian .",
    "it can therefore be assumed that the dynamics can be described by an equation of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : lind ] ) , upon suitable microscopic or phenomenological determination of the different coefficients and operators . in this case",
    "the interaction can be naturally taken of the form @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the number operator density for system and environment respectively . in this situation",
    "it can be shown @xcite that tracing over the gas degrees of freedom the master equation takes on the form @xmath17 \\nonumber\\\\    &   & + \\int { \\mathrm{d}}^{3 } { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q } } } \\mu ( { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q } } } ) \\left [    { \\mathrm{e}}^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q } } } { } \\cdot \\hat{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{x } } } } }    \\sqrt{s ( { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q}}},e ( { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q } } } , \\hat{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{p } } } } ) ) } \\rho_{s } (    t ) \\sqrt{s ( { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q}}},e ( { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q } } } , \\hat{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{p } } } } ) ) }    { \\mathrm{e}}^{- \\frac{i}{\\hbar } { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q } } } { } \\cdot \\hat{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{x } } } } }    \\right . \\nonumber\\\\    &   & \\hspace{6em } \\hspace{6em } \\left . - \\frac{1}{2 } \\ { s ( { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q}}},e (    { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{q } } } , \\hat{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{p } } } } ) ) , \\rho_{s } ( t ) \\ } \\right ] ,    \\label{eq : qbm } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the free kinetic hamiltonian , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 gas particle density and @xmath21 fourier transform of the interaction potential . in the expression @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 denote position and momentum operators of the test particle , so that the unitary operators @xmath24 describe momentum translations , while @xmath25 upon defining @xmath26 the master equation is fixed by the function @xmath27 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsf ] ) , also known as dynamic structure factor @xcite , which is actually the fourier transform of the density - density correlation function of the environment , which appears operator - valued being evaluated in * @xmath28 * , with @xmath29 energy transfer in a single collision , @xmath30 mass of the gas particle .",
    "note that one has the identity @xmath31 \\rangle ,    \\label{eq : qcf } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last contribution is non vanishing just due to the operator nature of the environmental quantities in the quantum description .",
    "this quantity depending on the density fluctuations can be directly related to the dynamic response function of the environment @xmath32 according to the fluctuation - dissipation formula @xmath33 the considered master equation describes both dissipation and decoherence effects in the stochastic dynamics of the particle undergoing quantum brownian motion . to put into evidence decoherence effects in the position representation",
    "it is convenient to consider a simplified expression in which we treat momentum as a classical variable , so that eq .",

    "off - diagonal matrix elements in the position representation are suppressed with elapsing time .",
    "this means in particular that if the system is initially in a coherent superposition of spatially separated states the quantum noise can drive the system to a classical mixture , which is a typical decoherence effect .",
    "this kind of models can explain decoherence effects in interference experiments with massive particles @xcite .",
    "note that a similar result for the dynamics of the statistical operator @xmath39 arises in dynamical reduction models @xcite , however only the average effect can be compared , in such models one has a localization effect acting on the single realizations , leading to a possible solution of the measurement problem @xcite .",
    "as a further example showing the relevance of quantum correlation functions in the description of a noisy quantum dynamics we consider an exactly solvable model of decoherence @xcite . in this case one considers a two - level system interacting with a bosonic reservoir according to the coupling @xmath40 where besides the standard pauli operator we have introduced complex coupling coefficients @xmath41 , as well as the creation and annihilation operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 obeying the standard canonical commutation relations . if we assume the bosonic reservoir to be in a thermal state the reduced dynamics can be exactly worked out and leads to a master equation which is in a form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lind ] ) , albeit with a time dependent coefficient @xmath17 + \\gamma ( t ) [ \\sigma_{z } \\rho_{s } ( t ) \\sigma_{z } -    \\rho_{s } ( t ) ] { } , \\label{eq : deph } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the free system hamiltonian .",
    "the time dependent coefficient @xmath45 is determined again from a correlation function depending on the environment operators appearing in the interaction term eq .",
    "( [ eq : tls ] ) and given by @xmath46 where the two contributions at the r.h.s .",
    "come from the evaluation of the correlation function relying on a decomposition as the one considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcf ] ) , where now the commutator part typically related to dissipation amounts to a @xmath47-number term .",
    "we have further introduced the so called spectral density @xmath48 , formally defined as @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the frequency of the bosonic modes appearing in the free hamiltonian of the environment @xmath51 , which actually allows to go over to a continuum limit embodying in itself dependence of the coupling strength on the environment frequencies as well as on the distribution of the environmental modes . for the decoherence dynamics described by the present model only the anticommutator part of the correlation function related to decoherence is relevant and one has in particular @xmath52 in view of the interaction term eq .",
    "( [ eq : tls ] ) one immediately sees that the diagonal matrix elements of the statistical operator in the basis of eigenvectors of the system hamiltonian are constant , while coherences are generally suppressed according to @xmath53 where bra and ket denote the eigenvectors of the @xmath54 operator , and the decoherence function @xmath55 is still determined by the spectral density and the correlation function of the environment through the expression @xmath56 as a result one has a general description of the decoherence dynamics of a two - level system coupled to bosonic degrees of freedom , allowing for a phenomenological modelling of the effective reservoir through the suitable definition of a spectral density .",
    "also in this model we have seen how the quantum stochastic dynamics is driven by correlation functions of the environment operators , which embody the noisy action of the quantum environment .",
    "if one considers a non isolated quantum system , its dynamics shows up an additional layer of stochasticity , on top of the probabilistic quantum description , which arises due to the interaction with the unobserved quantum environmental degrees of freedom . in this perspective quantum noise can be described applying the standard copenhagen formulation of quantum mechanics to the overall degrees of freedom . in this framework one",
    "is able to describe in a consistent way both dissipative and decoherence effects .",
    "the latter lead from a quantum probabilistic setting to a classical one , in which the interference capability of selected quantum degrees of freedom is suppressed . as",
    "a result one recovers a classical behaviour for certain degrees of freedom , however still not solving the measurement problem , which has to face the fact that macroscopic objects do appear in definite states , rather than in superpositions or classical mixture states .",
    "different techniques and approaches can be devised in order to describe the quantum noisy dynamics of such open quantum systems and in this contribution we have considered two paradigmatic examples within the framework of a master equation approach .",
    "it appears how the action of quantum noise in this description typically depends on the features of two - point correlation functions of the quantum operators of the environment involved in the interaction term .",
    "an important open issue in this and other descriptions of quantum noise within the standard copenhagen interpretation is the formulation and characterization of memory effects .",
    "recent work on the subject @xcite has put quantum non - markovianity in connection with properties of the statistical operator of the open system undergoing a stochastic dynamics , or of the mapping describing the reduced dynamics .",
    "this is at variance with the classical case , in which there is a clearcut definition of markovian noise in the framework of classical stochastic processes , which can not be directly used in the quantum framework @xcite .",
    "future characterization of quantum noise in view of its memory properties might well be connected with expression and features of multitime correlation functions of environmental quantum operators",
    ". a better understanding of the description of quantum noise will also be useful in view of a comparison between orthodox quantum mechanics and modifications of it , such as dynamical reduction models , aiming to a solution of the quantum measurement problem and leading to distinct experimental predictions , which are in principle detectable .",
    "indeed determination of experimental bounds on the value of the parameters appearing in such models , as well as their extension to a non - markovian regime , are the object of an intense research activity @xcite .",
