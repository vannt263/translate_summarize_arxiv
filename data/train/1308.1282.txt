    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point - like , off - nuclear , extra - galactic sources , with observed x - ray luminosities ( @xmath0 ) higher than the eddington luminosity for a stellar - mass black - hole ( @xmath1 ) . the true nature of these objects is still debated @xcite as there is still no unambiguous estimate for the mass of the compact object hosted in these systems . assuming an isotropic emission , in order to avoid the violation of the eddington limit , ulxs might be powered by accretion onto intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) with masses in the range @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it has been also suggested that ulxs appear very luminous due to a combination of moderately high mass , mild beaming and mild super - eddington emission and that ulxs are an inhomogeneous population composed of more than one class @xcite .",
    "ulxs have been studied intensively over the last decades ( see @xcite for a review ) . as in the case of black hole binaries ( bhbs )",
    ", some ulxs undergo spectral transitions from a _ power - law state _ state to a _ high - soft state _ ( see @xcite and reference therein for a description of the spectral states in bhbs ) .",
    "nevertheless , the classification of ulxs into canonical bh states is much more uncertain than in bhbs @xcite . during the _ power - law state _",
    "the spectra of ulxs show a power - law spectral shape in the 3 - 8kev spectral range , together with a high - energy turn - over at 6 - 7kev , and a _ soft excess _ at low energies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this _ soft excess",
    "_ can be modelled by emission coming from the inner accretion disc and is characterized by a low inner disc temperature of @xmath3kev .",
    "this is expected if the black holes in these sources are indeed imbhs @xcite .",
    "other explanations for the _ soft excess _ imply a much smaller mass for the black hole in these sources , based on the idea that the accretion in the disc is not intrinsically standard , in contrast to the majority of bhbs ( e.g. see @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite suggest that at least some ulxs are consistent with black holes accreting at moderate rate with masses of @xmath4 , as also supported by the analysis of n10 in the cartwheel galaxy @xcite .",
    "the study of the timing properties of ulxs represent a promising way to confirm the associations / similarities with this class of sources and bhbs .",
    "variability in accreting stellar - mass black holes is usually studied by means of the fourier analysis , which allows to produce power density spectra ( pds ) where several different components are usually observed .",
    "bhbs pds are usually composed of broad components ( in the form of red noise or band - limited noise ) and narrow components ( called quasi periodic oscillations , qpos ) .",
    "although we still know little about the physical origin of these temporal features , their phenomenology has proved useful in defining and identifying accretion states @xcite . @xcite performed a study of the fast time variability on various ulxs and found that for some sources the fast variability is suppressed for a reason which is currently unknown .",
    "@xcite proposed that the fast variability is suppressed for the sources with small inclination angle where the wind does not enter the line - of - sight .",
    "@xcite also found that a group of ulxs ( including ngc  5408 x1 ) have similar variability and pds as luminous bhbs and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the observed frequency band - pass ( @xmath5hz ) .    in this work",
    "we apply the root mean square ( rms)-intensity diagram ( @xcite ) , which has been proved to be useful to map states in bhbs ( without the need of any spectral information ) .",
    "we perform timing and spectral studies , focusing on the evolution of the broad - band noise and on its dependence on the spectral properties of the source .",
    "the ulx in ngc  5408 x1 was discovered with the _ einstein _ observatory ( stewart et  al . , 1983 ) and",
    "its _ soft excess _ found with _ rosat _",
    "it is located in a close - by ( @xmath6mpc , @xcite ) small ( size of @xmath7kpc ) starburst galaxy ( @xcite and references therein ) and at @xmath8arcsec from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this ulx peaks in x - ray luminosity above @xmath9@xmath10 and is relatively nearby .",
    "@xcite identified the optical counterpart possibly as a b0i supergiant star .",
    "spherically - symmetric nebulae around ngc  5408 x1 have been detected in radio and optical bands @xcite .",
    "this might indicate the presence of strong winds from a high - mass accretion rate source .",
    "@xcite found a qpo in its pds centred at @xmath11hz and inferred a mass for the black hole in the range of @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite propose a much smaller mass ( @xmath13 ) in base of the qpo and the timing properties .",
    "they propose that ngc  5408 x1 is accreting in a super - eddington regime and that the qpo is analogous to the ultra - low - frequency qpo seen occasionally in a few bhbs .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the timing and spectral properties of ngc  5408 x1 and have found that the qpo frequency is variable ( within the frequency range 0.0001 - 0.19hz ) and largely independent on the spectral parameters .",
    "they suggested that ngc  5408 x1 is accreting in the _ saturation regime _",
    "( increase of the qpo frequency with constant disc flux and power - law photon index ) frequently observed in bhbs @xcite .",
    "in this work we considered the 6 long ( 120 - 130ks ) high - quality observations of ngc  5408 x1 collected by the _ xmm - newton _ satellite over 6 years ( 2006 - 2011 ) .",
    "the epic camera was operating in the _ full frame _ mode and with the _ thin filter _ set ( see tab .  [ table_obs ] ) .",
    "some of the observations were affected by relatively high background rates ( flaring ) .",
    "we removed these periods for the timing data analysis by inspecting the light curve of the source .",
    "for the spectral analysis , we applied the standard filtering of removing time periods with count - rates in the fov higher than @xmath14 ( epic - pn only ) .    for the timing analysis , we filtered the epic pn+mos event files , selecting only the best - calibrated events ( pattern@xmath15 for the pn and the mos , respectively ) , and rejecting flagged events ( i.e. keeping only flag@xmath16 events ) from a circular region on the source ( centre at coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath18 ; @xcite ) and radius @xmath19arcsec .",
    "the radius chosen contains @xmath20 of the source photons , which is an optimal choice for not including too much background .",
    "no background subtraction was applied since the background contribution was found to be small .",
    "we payed particular attention to extract the list of photons not randomized in time . to this purpose",
    ", we used the tasks _ epchain _ for the pn and _ emproc _ ( with _ randomizetime = no _ ) for the mos cameras , respectively .        for the spectral analysis we used only the epic pn camera , in order to avoid issues due to cross - calibration effects . additionally , the epic pn camera has a higher effective area ( i.e. double ) than each one of the mos cameras and has sufficient statistics for the spectral fitting .",
    "we filtered the event files , selecting only the best - calibrated events ( pattern@xmath21 for the pn ) , and rejecting flagged events ( flag@xmath16 ) .",
    "we extracted the flux from a circular region on the source centred at the coordinates of the source and radius @xmath19arcsec .",
    "the background was extracted from an annular region ( with inner and outer radius of @xmath22arcsec , respectively ) centred at the coordinates of the source ( see fig .",
    "[ plot_region ] ) . to check the dependence of our results on these choices we also performed a background subtraction from a region in the same chip of the source and far away from it and from the boundaries and",
    "have seen no difference in the results shown in this paper .",
    "we built response functions with the _ science analysis system _ ( sas ) tasks rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "we fitted the background - subtracted spectra with standard spectral models in xspec 12.7.0 @xcite .",
    "all errors quoted in this work are @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) confidence .",
    "the spectral fits were limited to the 0.3 - 10kev range , where the calibration of the instruments is the best .",
    "the spectra were rebinned in order to have at least 25 counts for each background - subtracted spectral channel in order to perform the chi - squared fitting and to avoid oversampling of the intrinsic energy resolution by a factor larger than 3 .",
    "we performed an analysis of the fast time variability of ngc  5408 x1 separately in the 0.3 - 1kev and 1 - 10kev energy ranges .",
    "the ( 0.3 - 10kev ) epic count rate is @xmath25 on average .",
    "the time resolution of the instruments is 2.6s ( mos ) and 73.4ms ( pn ) .    for both analysis we took into account good time intervals ( gtis ) similar to the ones by @xcite ( see their fig .  1 )",
    "we excluded the periods of high - background with the introduction of a minimum number of gaps in the light curve that might produce artificial noise in our study of the intrinsic variability from the source .",
    "these time periods ( gaps ) were excluded from the pds generation .",
    "we used the ghats package , developed under the idl environment at inaf - oab , to produce the pds from 2048 points in each light curve .",
    "the pds were then averaged together for each observation .",
    "the pn+mos light curve was binned at the lowest time resolution of the two ( 2.6s ) .",
    "this yields a nyquist frequency of @xmath26hz .",
    "the pds were normalized according to @xcite .",
    "all of the pds show low - frequency flat - topped noise .",
    "pds fitting was carried out with the standard xspec fitting package by using a unit response .",
    "fitting the ( 0.3 - 1kev ) pds with a model constituted by a zero centred lorentzian for the flat - topped noise plus a constant for the poissonian noise results in mostly acceptable chi - square values only for the pds of obs .  4 ,  6 ( see tab .

    "the fit of the ( 1 - 10kev ) pds with a model constituted by a zero centred lorentzian for the flat - topped noise plus a constant for the poissonian noise results in a poor description of the data .",

    "there is an excess at low frequencies and fitting it with a power - law yields a non - significant component ( @xmath39 ) for obs .",
    "1,6 that again we took into account , since the change in the fractional rms is of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "the photon index was unconstrained , so we fixed its value to 2 , which is the asymptotic high - frequency slope of a lorentzian .",
    "additionally , the ( 1 - 10kev ) pds of obs .",
    "2 shows positive residuals in the form of a peak centred at @xmath41 , consistent with previous findings @xcite .",
    "the detection of this peak is not significant ( @xmath42 , calculated as the value of the lorentzian normalization divided by its @xmath24 error ) .",
    "we did not include this component in our fits since it does not affect substantially the measure of the fractional rms ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we calculated the fractional rms from the best fit model ( integrated in the 0.0001 - 0.19hz band ) .",
    "this was found to be @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the 0.31kev and 110kev energy ranges , respectively .",

    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ plots_timing1 ] and [ plots_timing2 ] the broad - band pds with the best - fit model .",
    "we notice that the integration of the rms from the data itself , without modeling , yields consistent values for the total fractional rms .                    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in fig .",
    "[ plot_lc ] we show the light curve from the total flux ( i.e. source plus emission from the diffuse component ) and from the source , separated in its different components ( disc and high - energy component  the last also called comptonization component ) .",
    "focusing on the light curve behaviour from the source we see that the disc component shows no significant variations ( within @xmath46 errors ) in flux .",
    "on the other hand we see significant variations ( at the @xmath47 level with respect to the mean value ) in the flux from the high - energy component .",
    "these variations are very similar to the variations from the total flux . therefore , it looks like the variations of the total flux are due to variations of the high - energy component . additionally , the broad - band noise in the 1 - 10kev shows significant variations ( at the @xmath47 level with respect to the mean value ) .",
    "these two quantities ( broad - band noise and total / high - energy component flux ) appear to be anti - correlated , with a linear correlation coefficient of -0.87 ( using the least - squares procedure ) .",
    "this corresponds to a chance probability of @xmath48 . also , the ( 1 - 10kev ) count rate is anti - correlated with the fractional rms , with a linear correlation coefficient of -0.93 .",

    "in this paper we report on the timing and spectral analysis of the longest _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc  5408 x1 . the only significant ( @xmath50 ) spectral variation is the flux from the high - energy component ( see fig .  [ plot_lc ] ) . in the following",
    "we assume that the _ soft excess _ is physically a disc component , in order to compare with the case of bhbs .",
    "the variations in the flux from the disc component are less than @xmath51 with respect to the mean value ( where @xmath52 is the mean error from the flux values ) . regarding the fast time variability from ngc  5408 x1",
    ", the fractional rms in the 0.31kev energy range does not significantly vary between the observations and is @xmath53 in the @xmath54hz frequency range , in agreement with previous studies @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the fractional rms in the 110kev energy range is high ( in agreement with the previous studies ) and variable between the observations ( @xmath55 ) . in the following",
    "our goal is to compare our findings with the case of bhbs .",
    "traditionally , the variability of bhbs has been associated to the high - energy emission component ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is because , although strong variations in the luminosity of the disc component are seen on the long time - scales corresponding to transitions between the soft and the hard spectral states , the disc - dominated soft states show very little rapid variability ( fractional rms@xmath56 ; e.g. @xcite ) . in the low / hard state of bhbs",
    "the understanding of the origin of the variability has been limited by a lack of spectral coverage of the disc component , which emits at @xmath57kev , and so is not covered by the band - pass of detectors such as the _ proportional counter array _ ( pca ) on the _ rxte _ satellite ( 2 - 60kev ) .",
    "nevertheless , a recent study of the x - ray variability in the low / hard state of bhbs has been performed with _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , who have found a disc component variability with a fractional rms of @xmath58 for swift  j1753.50127 and gx  3394 over long time - scales ( 2.7 - 270s ) when the source was in the low / hard state . from our work",
    "we see that in the case of ngc  5408 x1 the 0.3 - 1kev energy range is dominated by emission from the inner disc ( contributing @xmath59 of the total flux , with the high - energy component contributing @xmath60 only ) .",
    "we have found that the fractional variability from ngc  5408 x1 in the 0.3 - 1kev energy range and @xmath54hz frequency range is of @xmath44 .",
    "this is less than what has been found in the _ xmm - newton _ band - pass for bhbs .",
    "the difference might be due to the fact that both the disc and the power - law components contribute differently to the 0.31kev energy range in the case of ngc  5408 x1 with respect to the case of bhbs , since the latter have hotter inner disc emission .",
    "in contrast , rms of several tens per cent is seen in the low / hard spectral state of bhbs which are energetically dominated by the high - energy component emission in the _ rxte _ band - pass ( 2 - 15kev ) . we have found that in the case of ngc  5408 x1 the 1 - 10kev energy range is dominated by the high - energy emission component ( contributing @xmath61 of the total flux ) and that little emission comes from the accretion disc in the 1 - 10kev energy range ( @xmath62 ) , similarly to what has been found in gx  3394 in the 215kev energy range during the low / hard state .",
    "this fact means that we can only use our results from the study of the fast variability of ngc  5408 x1 in the 110kev band for the comparison with the case of bhbs ( i.e. measured with _ rxte _ ) , since the contribution to the flux from the disc component are small in both cases .",
    "it is in this energy range ( i.e. 1 - 10kev ) where we are measuring fractional rms variabilities similar to the high - energy component during the low / hard state of gx  3394 ( i.e. @xmath63 ) .    from a detailed study of the variability of the bhb gx  3394 with _",
    "it has been seen that its variability decreases as its total flux ( and the contribution from the disc component flux ) increases .",
    "this has also seen to occur in a wider sample of bhbs using _ rxte _ data only @xcite .",
    "we discovered that the the ( 1 - 10kev ) count rate from ngc  5408 x1 is anti - correlated with the fractional rms over long time - scales ( years ) , similarly to the behaviour of the bhb gx  339 - 4 during the bright stage of the low / hard state measured with the _ rxte _ satellite ( @xcite ; hereafter called bright hard state ) .",
    "the relationship found by @xcite for gx  339 - 4 is valid over time - scales of weeks to months , thus shorter than in our case .",
    "also , the noise in the pds of ngc  5408 x1 is in a lower frequency interval ( 0.0001 - 0.19hz ) than gx  339 - 4 in the low / hard state ( 0.1 - 64hz frequency range ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the characteristic time - scales of variability appear at lower frequency in the case of ngc  5408 x1 with respect to gx  339 - 4 might be due to the higher mass of the bh and accretion rate in the former , as previously noticed to occur in a comparison in the case of bhbs with their higher mass analogs , i.e. the agn @xcite .",
    "previous studies revealed that a linear absolute rms versus flux positive correlation occurs on short time - scales ( few ks ) in ngc  5408 x1 @xcite .",
    "contrary to our work , this result was found on short timescales where the pds is restricted to being stationary . on the other hand ,",
    "a recent study of the timing behaviour of bhbs @xcite but using _ rxte _ data ( @xmath64kev ) , has shown that the same rms - flux anti - correlation we have found here holds in the bright hard state of gx  339 - 4 ( see their fig.4 - 5 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results reported earlier by @xcite .",
    "both studies and our work use the non - stationary rms - flux on long timescales which samples changes to the whole pds .      as described in sec.[introd ] , determining the mass from the bh in ngc  5408 x1 has been the goal of several studies . however , there is still no consensus on whether it is an imbh or a stellar - mass bh .",
    "previous estimates from the timing properties @xcite indicate a mass of @xmath65 , thus an imbh , but others @xcite indicate a much smaller mass of @xmath66 , thus a stellar - mass bh .",
    "can still be formed through direct stellar - collapse ( @xcite ) and this is why we are referring to them as _ stellar - mass _ bhs .",
    "] in the first case considered the accretion rate is sub - eddington , whilst the latter case indicates ( near or ) super - eddington accretion .    in the following",
    "we use the results obtained from the spectral analysis .",
    "the low inner disc temperatures found for some ulxs were interpreted as an evidence for the presence of imbh @xcite . in the standard disc - black body model ( i.e. multi - color disc blackbody or mcd ; @xcite ) , which is a very poor approximation of the real standard accretion disc theory @xcite ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity from the accretion disc is calculated as :    @xmath67    here @xmath68 @xcite is the ratio of the color temperature to the effective temperature , or ",
    "spectral hardening factor  , and @xmath69 is a correction factor taking into account the fact that @xmath70 occurs at a radius somewhat larger than @xmath71 ( @xcite give @xmath72 ) .",
    "the behaviour explained above is a viable explanation of the temperature - luminosity behaviour of most bhbs ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , a recent spectral study of the spectral variability from a sample of ulxs , including ngc  5408 x1 @xcite , has shown that the _ soft excess _",
    "( i.e. the disc component fitted in the spectra ) from ngc  5408 x1 does not follow eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] but @xmath73 .",
    "this in contrast to what is found for many bhbs and might indicate that the standard accretion disc theory is not is not a proper interpretation in the case of ngc  5408 x1 .",
    "this implies that the hypothesis on which the imbh idea is relying ( i.e. standard accretion disc theory and the presence of a cold disc ) are not valid and it might indicate that the bh in ngc  5408 x1 is not an imbh .    therefore , other inner disc configurations might be possible in the case of ngc  5408 x1 .",
    "the large apparent luminosities in the case of ulxs can be explained by supercritical accretion ( exceeding the eddington luminosity ) onto a stellar - mass bh . in a recent study @xcite",
    "it has been proposed that at high accretion rates an outflow forms within the so - called spherization radius . for a face - on observer",
    "the luminosity is high because of geometrical beaming @xcite .",
    "such an observer has a direct view of the inner hot accretion disc , which has a peak temperature @xmath74kev in stellar - mass bhs .",
    "in this model the _ soft excess _ corresponds to the emission from the spherization radius .",
    "therefore , having a stellar - mass bh implies the presence of a much hotter inner accretion disc ( i.e. with temperatures higher than the _ soft excess _ ) , that would be observed in the spectrum if the inner disc inclination is low . this could be the responsible for the `` comptonization '' component seen in the spectra from ngc  5408 x1 , that could be emission from the inner disc instead .",
    "such a super - eddington flow implies much lower values for the mass of the bh , i.e. @xmath75 , accreting at mildly super - eddington rates ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario has been proposed @xcite , in which the presence of a cold and optically thick corona is obscuring the inner region of the disc and in this case the mcd parameters can not provide reliable estimates of the black hole mass .",
    "again this scenario is compatible with a stellar - mass bh , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "these models are consistent with the idea that there is a relatively stable component at soft energies diluting the variability as might be expected by a thermal disc ( see @xcite ) or optically thick photospheric component @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the timing properties of ngc  5408 x1 over long time - scales ( years ) show that the variability properties , in particular the rms , change and resemble those from the bhb gx  3394 during the bright phase of the hard state .",
    "these properties are the presence of a high broad - band timing noise and an anti - correlation of the fractional rms versus the high - energy count rate .    in the case of bhbs the hard state",
    "is not only seen during low accretion rates .",
    "indeed , high accretion levels have been reached in a few cases . in the case of gs 2023@xmath78338 and cyg  x1 ; @xcite quasi - eddington luminosities have been observed during the hard state .",
    "ngc  5408 x1 has similar properties to what is found in the bhb gx  3394 during its bright hard state .",
    "additionally , in the hard state of gx  3394 the major spectral change is in the flux from the high - energy component ( see fig .  6 of @xcite ) .",
    "this behaviour is again similar to what is seen in the case of ngc  5408 x1 ( fig .",
    "[ plot_lc ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , an identification of the accretion state with the low / hard state seen in bhbs can not be made .",
    "the spectral properties of ngc  5408 x1 are like ulxs in the so called `` power - law state '' @xcite . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ introd ] , during the `` power - law state '' the spectra of ulxs show a power - law spectral shape in the 3 - 8kev spectral range , together with a high - energy turn - over at 6 - 7kev , and a _ soft excess _ at low energies ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". there might be a corona in the case of ngc  5408 x1 ( and other ulxs ) that is much colder and thicker than in the case of bhbs .",
    "alternatively , there could be an intense accretion wind that is producing both the spectrum shape and the variability observed .",
    "the different properties could be due simply because of a much higher eddington ratio in the case of ngc  5408 x1 .",
    "the absolute rms of ngc  5408 x-1 in our observations is compatible with being constant within @xmath24 errors .",
    "this is not compatible with a low / hard state - like behaviour in bhbs ( and gx  3394 in particular ) , where the absolute rms increases with count rate @xcite .",
    "alternatively , this behaviour is similar to what has been seen in gx  3394 during the hard intermediate state , in particular at the point where its fractional variability is of @xmath79 and where the presence of an accretion disc is detected for the first time @xcite . in this state",
    "the fractional rms decreases as the count rate increases , as we observe to occur in ngc  5408 x1 .",
    "the fact that the fractional rms is of the order of @xmath80 in the case of gx  3394 whilst in the case of ngc  5408 x1 is of the order of @xmath81 is not problematic , since it can be explained by the presence of a much colder accretion disc ( see sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] ) for the ulx .",
    "this decreases the contribution of the accretion disc component in the 1 - 10kev energy range and diminishes the effect of suppression of variability in this energy range for the ulx .",

    "<S> the notion of source states characterizing the x - ray emission from black hole binaries has revealed to be a very useful tool to disentangle the complex spectral and aperiodic phenomenology displayed by those classes of accreting objects . </S>",

    "<S> we studied the broad - band noise variability of the source and found an anti - correlation between the root mean square variability in the 0.00010.2hz and intensity , similarly to what is observed in black - hole binaries during the hard states . </S>",
