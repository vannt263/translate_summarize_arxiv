    "nonlinear transformations in quantum optics can yield dramatic nonclassical effects , particularly if the kerr optical nonlinearity ( intensity  dependent refractive index ) is exploited  @xcite . in the context of optical quantum information theory ,",
    "this nonlinearity has been identified as an important resource for processing photons encoded via the dual rail approach  @xcite ; in practice , though , nonlinear materials suffer from weak strengths and high losses .",
    "recently knill , laflamme and milburn ( klm )  @xcite showed that a nondeterministic kerr transformation can be effected for states with up to two photons via linear optical interferometry , and the cases where the desired transformation has been performed are distinguished by photon counting measurements on ancilla modes .",
    "although this nondeterministic nonlinear transformation works only a fraction of the time , the gate operation can be used offline from the quantum computation , and the cases where the gate has operated properly can be incorporated into the quantum circuit via quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "the roadmap to basic linear optics quantum computation  @xcite begins with the implementation of a nondeterministic nonlinear sign change .",
    "this gate is also of great interest for quantum optics applications that require nonlinear transformations of states that can be written as a superposition of a finite number of fock states ; e.g.  @xcite    linear optics transformations involve beam splitters , phase shifters and mirrors , and these devices are well understood  @xcite , but the other key aspect of the nondeterministic nonlinear gate is the employment of photon counters .",
    "this requirement of photon counting is distinct from photodetection , which generally detects only the presence or absence of light  @xcite ; photon counting measurements must be able to detect the number of indistinguishable photons in the same spatial , temporal , and polarization mode . with this in mind , klm discuss practical means for counting photons via an array of beamsplitters and single ",
    "photon counting modules ( spcms ) , incorporating the effects of finite  efficiency photodetection .",
    "the use of arrays of spcms to construct a photon counter has been studied in detail by kok and braunstein  @xcite .",
    "photodetection plays a critical role in two stages of the klm scheme .",
    "the first stage is the nondeterministic gate that performs the nonlinear transformation ( specifically , the nonlinear sign ( ns ) gate ) , and the success or failure is determined by photon counting of ancillary modes .",
    "the second stage is the quantum teleportation of a successful gate operation , where photon counting also plays an important role .",
    "our interest here is the nonlinear transformation ; the effects of limited photon detection efficiency in the latter stage of quantum teleportation has been investigated by glancy _",
    "et al _  @xcite who show that a high efficiency is required for teleportation of the gate to succeed . in this paper",
    ", we consider the ns gate operation alone , and we use the gate fidelity  @xcite to characterise successful nonlinear transformations . ultimately the success or failure of the transformation depends on the application of this component of a quantum optical circuit , but the fidelity provides a useful measure of the gate s performance . as a reference , we present the gate fidelity for a deterministic linear optical transformation and point out that , if the gate fidelity of the ns gate is less than that of the deterministic linear one , it is essentially useless at performing a nonlinear transformation . consequently the gate fidelity for the deterministic linear optical transformation",
    "gives a lower bound for a gate s capability of performing a nonlinear transformation .    in practice ,",
    "a very large array of spcms is not feasible to perform the photon counting measurement . in section  [ sec : measurements ] we describe two measurement schemes , the double detector array ( dda ) and the visible light photon counter ( vlpc )  @xcite , which comprise realistic schemes to approximate a photon counting measurement .",
    "we analyse the role of the dda and the vlpc in nondeterministic nonlinear transformations in detail in section  [ sec : nsgate ] , focussing on the ns gate of the klm scheme with particular attention directed towards a proper accounting of photodetection efficiency .",
    "we calculate the gate fidelity for each of two cases ( for the dda and for the vlpc ) as a function of detector efficiency and compare to that of a linear optical transformation .",
    "we conclude , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , with how current detectors and technology may be used to perform nondeterministic nonlinear transformations in quantum information and quantum optics .",
    "photon counting is the measurement of the number of photons in a mode ( i.e. , the number of intrinsically indistinguishable photons propagating in the same temporal , spatial , and polarization mode ) .",
    "such a measurement is described by the _ photon counting povm _",
    "@xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the @xmath2photon fock state .",
    "such a measurement can not be achieved using current technology  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we describe two measurement schemes that can , to some degree , approximate this measurement : the double detector array ( dda ) and the visible light photon counter ( vlpc ) .      in general",
    ", photodetection operates on a threshold principle : an event is registered if any light is detected , and the number of quanta is not revealed in this signal .",
    "we define a _ threshold detector _ as a detector that is triggered by one or more photons , and can not distinguish the number of photons  @xcite .",
    "thus , the povm for a threshold detector consists of two elements , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , corresponding to the detection of no photons or at least one photon . for a threshold detector with unit efficiency ,",
    "the povm is @xmath5 with finite detection efficiency @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the probability of registering a detection given an input of a one  photon fock state ) , the povm is @xmath8 |n\\rangle    \\langle n| \\ , .\\ ] ]    using a 50/50 beamsplitter and two finite efficiency threshold detectors , one can construct a detector cascade  @xcite that can ( sometimes ) distinguish one photon from two ; we refer to such a scheme as a double detector array ( dda ) .",

    "the incoming mode is dispersed over many detector modes ( active regions ) that behave independently ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : ddavlpc]b .",
    "the vlpc can be modelled as a detector cascade using @xmath15 beamsplitters and finite efficiency threshold detectors .",
    "for the low photon numbers used in the klm scheme , the probability of two or more photons entering the same active region is negligible ; thus , one can use the approximation @xmath16 .",

    "it is necessary to establish a benchmark for the gate fidelity , in order to determine the ability of the ns gate to perform a nonlinear transformation .",
    "one approach is to determine how such a ns gate compares with a gate that uses only linear optics .",
    "for example , consider the tranformation @xmath69 this transformation is a linear phase shift , implemented using a phase shifter or a path  length delay . although it does not implement the ns gate ( due to the factor of @xmath70 on the @xmath34 term )",
    ", it does a similar transformation and thus one can calculate the fidelity , comparing this output state to the desired ns output @xmath57 : @xmath71 the gate fidelity for the linear phase shift is obtained ( using the minimizing state with @xmath72 ) to be @xmath73 , and it can easily be shown that this gate fidelity is the maximum obtainable using linear optics alone .",
    "thus , we can construct a gate with gate fidelity @xmath74 using only linear optics ( specifically , a linear phase shift ) .",
    "this value sets a benchmark for any implementation of a ns gate : the gate fidelity must exceed @xmath74 in order to be considered a nonlinear gate .    observing the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelity ] , it is seen that the ns gate fidelity using ddas exceeds the threshold of @xmath74 for @xmath75 , whereas the vlpc  based scheme exceeds this threshold for @xmath76 .",
    "as shown here , the function of a nondeterministic nonlinear gate ( such as the ns gate ) employing photon counting depends critically on the photon counting measurement model .",
    "the two photon counting schemes analyzed here , representing current technology , can only approximate an ideal photon counting measurement . as a result",
    ", the ns gate employing realistic detection schemes can only approximate the desired nonlinear transformation .",
    "we have characterised the function of the ns gate with two realistic photon counting models by the gate fidelity , which describes the worst ",
    "case fidelity of an output state compared with the ideal output state , normalized to an apparently successful operation . with ddas",
    ", the ns gate achieves a maximum gate fidelity of @xmath77 with unit efficiency detectors , and does not achieve the critical value of @xmath74 for realistic spcm efficiencies .",
    "thus , we conclude that a nonlinear transformation using a dda  based ns gate can not be achieved ( although we note that adding more beamsplitters and spcms to form an array can increase the maximum gate fidelity ) . by comparison , the vlpc achieves a gate fidelity of one for unit efficiency , and performs well ( @xmath78 ) for realistic vlpc efficiencies of @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the gate fidelity drops rapidly with efficiency less than one .",
    "performing nonlinear transformations using only linear optics and photon counting represents an exciting new paradigm for nonlinear quantum optics and quantum information .",
    "current photodetection devices such as the vlpc can allow for nondeterministic nonlinear transformations to be performed using present technology",
