    "the @xmath7 chorus apparatus combines a 770 kg nuclear emulsion target with various electronic detectors : a scintillating fibre tracker system , trigger hodoscopes , an air - core magnet , a lead / scintillator calorimeter and a muon spectrometer .",
    "details about the experimental setup and the performances of the sub - detectors can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in the 1994 - 1997 period , chorus has collected 2,271,000 triggers corresponding to @xmath8 protons on target . of these",
    ", 458,601 have a muon identified in the final state ( the so called @xmath9 events ) and 116,049 do not ( the so called @xmath10 events ) and a vertex position compatible with one of the four emulsion target stacks .",
    "all tracks , associated to the interaction vertex , with an angle less than 0.4 rad with the beam axis and , in view of the large emulsion background of muons originating from a nearby secondary target , bigger than 0.05 rad from the direction of this target are extrapolated downstream and selected for further analysis .",
    "these tracks are searched for in the emulsion if their charge is negative and their momentum is in the range @xmath11  gev / c and @xmath12  gev / c for hadrons and muons , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that use has not been made of the energy deposition in the calorimeter to reject electrons or unidentified muons .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath13 leptonic decay modes to the @xmath10 data sample is taken into account in the evaluation of the sensitivity .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the emulsion scanning methods , previously described in  @xcite , have been applied to a fraction of the 1994 - 1995 - 1996 data .",
    "no @xmath13 decay candidate has been found , leading to a more stringent 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the @xmath0 oscillation probability ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this negative result is compatible with an estimated background of less than one event , mainly from `` white kink '' secondary interactions in the @xmath10 channel . with the large increase in statistics expected from the ongoing analysis of the data ,",
    "a direct measurement of this background process will be possible and kinematical cuts are planned for its reduction .",
    "furthermore , a second phase of the analysis ( with better efficiencies , larger statistics and faster automatic emulsion scanning ) has started with the aim of reaching the design sensitivity @xmath15  @xcite .",
