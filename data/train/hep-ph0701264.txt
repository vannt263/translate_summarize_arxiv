    "fragmentation refers to the process of a parton which carries large transverse momentum and subsequently forms a jet containing the expected hadron @xcite . at sufficiently large transverse momentum of the heavy quarkonium production ,",

    "generally , the fragmentation processes of heavy quarkonium @xmath9 production can be expressed as @xcite @xmath10 & = & \\sum_{a , b , c } \\int^1_0 d x_a    \\int^1_0 d x_b \\int^1_0 d z f_{a / a } ( x_a , q ) \\times\\\\    &   & f_{b / b } ( x_b , q ) d \\hat{\\sigma } ( a + b \\rightarrow c + x ) d_{c    \\rightarrow h } ( z , q),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are incident partons in the colliding hadrons @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the parton distribution functions at the scale @xmath17 of the partonic subprocess @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the fragmenting parton ( either a gluon or a quark ) and the sum runs over all possible parton contributions ; @xmath20 is the fragmentation function with respect to the scale @xmath17 which can be obtained by evolving from the initial fragmentation function @xmath21 using altarelli - parisi equations @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the splitting functions of a parton @xmath24 into a parton @xmath25 .",
    "the initial gluon fragmentation function @xmath26 is a universal function defined by factorization in the infinite momentum frame of the fragmenting gluon .",
    "it can also be obtained by calculating a specific physical process in perturbative qcd in the finite momentum frame of fragmenting gluon @xcite , where the @xmath0 is defined in the lorentz boost invariant form ( e.g. eq .  ( [ lightcone ] ) or ( [ qiao ] ) ) .",
    "the resulting initial fragmentation function , independent of the momentum of the parent gluon , is equivalent to the one derived in the infinite momentum frame . @xmath27 in above equations we take the @xmath28 axis along the momentum of fragmenting gluon",
    ". then , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the energies and @xmath28-components of the four - momenta of the fragmenting gluon and the produced heavy quarkonium @xmath9 , respectively . in eq .",

    "the eqs .",
    "( [ lightcone ] ) and ( [ qiao ] ) are hard to be employed in the application of the gluon fragmentation functions , because they involve the transverse momentum of the resulting heavy quarkonium . instead , usually the non - covariant definitions as follows are used approximately : @xmath31 when the fragmenting gluon momentum @xmath32 , these non - covariant definitions are equivalent to the light - cone definition in eq .",
    "( [ lightcone ] ) .",
    "however when the momentum of the fragmenting gluon remains finite , these non - covariant definitions of @xmath0 may induce large uncertainties in the application of the fragmentation functions .",

    "about a decade ago , people noticed that the parton to heavy quarkonium fragmentation functions can be obtained analytically @xcite .",

    "since it is possible that the @xmath40 may possess momentum opposite to that of the virtual gluon , in the definition of ( [ appdef3 ] ) , the condition of @xmath54 exists .",
    "and because of the non - zero invariant mass of the virtual gluon , even @xmath55 happens .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ figappdef3 ]",
    "the fragmentation functions distribute in the scope of @xmath56 . as shown in the figure , when the virtual gluon momentum @xmath32 , fragmentation functions approach to the one in the light - cone definition . when @xmath57 and @xmath58gev , the ratios of fragmentation probabilities in the definition of ( 5 ) , that is the integrations of the corresponding fragmentation functions over @xmath0 , to the one in light - cone definition are 0.49 , 0.65 , 0.77 , 0.91 and 0.97 respectively in the range of @xmath59 .",
    "this indicates that the smaller the virtual gluon momentum is , the more possible the produced @xmath60 will be opposite to the gluon .",
    "therefore , uncertainties occur in the application of the fragmentation function in the definition of ( [ appdef3 ] ) when gluon momentum @xmath53 is not big enough .",

    "the parton distribution function of cteq6l @xcite is employed .",
    "as shown in the figure , the cross - section decreases quite fast as the gluon momentum increases .",
    "whereas , from the analysis above , we know that the at some low energies of the fragmenting gluon there are large discrepancies between the fragmentation functions with non - covariant definitions and boost - invariant definitions of @xmath0 .",
