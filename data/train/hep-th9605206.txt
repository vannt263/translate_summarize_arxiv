    "we construct the explicit expression for the divergent part of the one - loop effective action without any restrictions to the form and the order of the operator @xmath2 in the 4-dimentional space - time .",
    "then the divergent part of the one - loop effective action can be found only by making the simplest algebraic operations , for example , by computers .",

    "this condition is very convenient for the calculations , so we will assume it to be satisfied",
    ".    the operator is called minimal if @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a totally symmetric tensor , built by @xmath14 :    @xmath15    if an operator can not be reduced to this form , we will call it nonminimal one .",
    "commuting covariant derivatives we can rewrite a minimal operator in the form :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 .",
    "the one - loop effective action ( [ efac ] ) can be presented as a sum of one - loop diagrams , say , for a minimal operator , as follows :    @xmath18    where    @xmath19    and we omit an infinite numerical constant .",
    "terms @xmath20 can be found by a series expansion of the operator in powers of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in the momentum space",
    "the propagator is @xmath23 .",
    "the form of the vertexes is rather evident , for example , the vertex with the external line of @xmath24 type can be written as    @xmath25    similar notations we will use for other expressions , for example ,    @xmath26    numerical factors for the feynman graphs can be easily found by ( [ purttheor ] ) .",
    "the number of diagrams in ( [ purttheor ] ) is infinite , but most of them are convergent .",

    "( we excluded divergent graphs , that give zero contribution to the effective action , for example , some tadpole ones . )",
    "the extension of this results to a nonminimal operator will be made below .",
    "now we should calculate the divergent part of diagrams presented at the fig .",
    "[ flatdiagrams ] .",
    "we will do it using dimensional regularization .",
    "so , in order to find the divergent part of an integral    @xmath38    it is necessary to expand the function @xmath39 into series , retain only logarithmically divergent terms and perform the integration according to the following equations @xcite    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a unit vector ( @xmath42 ) and    @xmath43    using this prescription one can easily find the divergent part of the diagrams at the fig  [ flatdiagrams ] .",
    "the calculations are presented in details in the appendix [ minimalcalc ] .",
    "collecting the results for all graphs , we obtain the divergent part of the one - loop effective action for the minimal operator ( [ minimal1 ] ) in the flat space :    @xmath44    where    @xmath45    in order to extend this result to the curved space - time we first consider a minimal operator in the form ( [ minimal1 ] ) .",
    "in this case we can not calculate all divergent graphs , because their number is infinite .",
    "( the matter is that the degree of divergence does not depend on the number of @xmath46 vertexes and there are infinite number of such vertexes too ) .",
    "nevertheless if we note that the answer should be invariant under the general coordinate transformations , the result can be found by calculating only a finite number of graphs .",
    "really , we should replace derivatives in ( [ flat ] ) by the covariant ones and add expressions , containing curvature tensors @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the most general form of additional terms is    @xmath49    where    @xmath50    ( we take into account that the expression @xmath51 is a total derivative and may be omitted ) .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath52 - @xmath53 can be found by calculating the diagrams presented at the fig .",
    "[ curveddiagrams ] .",
    "they conform to the first nontrivial approximation in the counterterm expansion in powers of weak fields @xmath54 and @xmath9 .    in the appendix [ minimalcalc ] we present detailed calculation of the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the other ones were found in the same way .",
    "after rather cumbersome calculations we obtain the following formula for the divergent part of the one - loop effective action for a minimal operator ( [ minimal1 ] ) in the curved space :    @xmath57    it is more convenient sometimes to use a different form of the operator :    @xmath58    where @xmath13 was defined in ( [ k0 ] ) .    by the help of the same method we found the following answer for the divergent part of the one - loop effective action :    @xmath59",

    "@xmath62 depends on some additional fields @xmath66 besides @xmath46 and @xmath22 .",
    "it will be considered in details below .",
    "the divergent graphs are the same as in the case of a minimal operator ( see fig .",
    "[ flatdiagrams ] ) , but because of the difference of the propagators the calculations are also different .",
    "they are considered in the appendix [ nondiagcalc ] .",
    "the result is    @xmath67    where we use the following notations ( compare with ( [ minnot ] ) )    @xmath68    etc .",
    "the generalization of this result to the curved space - time can also be made in the frames of the weak field approximation .",
    "we should substitute derivatives in ( [ nondiagflat ] ) by the covariant ones and add some terms , containing curvature tensors .",
    "the additional terms can be found by calculating feynman diagrams , that conform to the first terms of their expansion over weak fields .",
    "nevertheless , in this case there are some difficulties , for example , now we do not know @xmath69 and , therefore , how it depends on @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we do not know expressions for vertexes in the weak field limit .",
    "in order to overcome this difficulty we will use the following trick . suppose , that @xmath70 does not depend on @xmath14 , but depend on some external fields @xmath71 .",
    "also , we impose a condition    @xmath72    that is , of cause , satisfied if @xmath70 depends only on @xmath14 . from ( [ covder ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath73 should be considered as a weak field .",
    "thus , unlike the minimal operator , besides the diagrams with external @xmath74 and @xmath75 lines , presented at the fig  [ curveddiagrams ] we should consider also graphs with external @xmath76 lines , presented at the fig  [ phidiagrams ] .    computing this diagrams we obtain expressions , containing @xmath77 . substituting it by ( [ covder ] ) , we found the result depending on @xmath46 and @xmath22 .",
    "the calculation of graphs , presented at the fig  [ curveddiagrams ] gives results , that can not be written as a weak field limit of a covariant expression .",
    "nevertheless , the covariant result should be found by adding a contribution of diagrams with external @xmath76-lines .",
    "therefore , for a nonminimal operator we can not calculate terms , containing @xmath78 and @xmath48 separately .",
    "we illustrate the above discussion in the appendix [ nondiagcalc ] by calculating the simplest group of diagrams .    summing up the results for all graphs , we find the divergent part of the one - loop effective action for an arbitrary nonminimal operator    @xmath79    where    @xmath80    and an exact form of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are given in ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "we should note , that deriving ( [ answer ] ) we omitted total derivatives , and therefore we must make the following substitutions    @xmath83    although the result is very large , the calculations of the effective action can be easily made by computers . for example , we considered particular cases ( see next section ) using tensor package @xcite for the reduce analytical calculation system @xcite .",
    "the presented algorithm can be applied for calculations of the effective action for theories regularized by higher derivatives @xcite and theories in the nonminimal gauges",
    ". may be there are some other prospects .",
    "here we consider only the simplest test examples in order to check the correctness of the method .",
    "we prove , that our results agree with the earlier known ones and each other .",

    "we obtain ( [ diaganswer2 ] ) .",
    "so , we proved the agreement of the results for the minimal and nonminimal operators .",
