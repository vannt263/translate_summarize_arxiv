    "melting and crystallization are fundamental processes in nature and have been widely studied .",
    "charged particles systems like e.g.  colloids  @xcite and dusty plasma s  @xcite display similar phase behavior as atoms and molecules with the added advantage that the micrometer size of the particles and their slower dynamics make them accessible for real space imaging @xcite .",
    "most of the previous research was directed towards one - component systems .",
    "recently , in a theoretical study in ref .",
    "@xcite the complexity of the system was increased by investigating systems with two types of particles of different radii and different effective charge confined in a parabolic trap . a recent experimental study @xcite concentrated on oppositely charged colloidal particles confined in a cavity and found a remarkable diversity of new binary structures . in this letter",
    "we consider a finite size binary system of repulsive particles which are confined to move in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the circular hard wall confinement potential competes with the 2d wigner crystal structure  @xcite and leads to ring like arrangements for the particles  @xcite .",
    "previously it was shown experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite that single component systems exhibit a remarkable re - entrant melting behavior . in the present binary system",
    "we assume a large difference in the size and ` charge ' of the particles and therefore the smaller particles can be considered as ` defects ' which disturb the order of the big particles  @xcite .",
    "we found that these defect particles have a pronounced effect on the melting behavior of the system and results in an unexpected stabilization of the ordered phase and a new reentrant melting behavior .",
    "the possibility of stabilization was also addressed in the theoretical study of ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of few binary coulomb clusters confined in a parabolic trap .",
    "the present study is motivated by the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite where the melting behavior of a binary system of paramagnetic colloidal spheres ( with different radii ) confined in 2d circular cavities was studied .",
    "the coupling parameter could be tuned by changing the applied magnetic field strength .",
    "they found that : 1 ) the shell - like structure of the system depends strongly on the relative number of big ( @xmath0 ) and small particles ( @xmath1 ) , and 2 ) the melting process takes place in several stages where first the small particles and afterwards the big particles become delocalized .",
    "in our model , like the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the particles are confined by a circular hard wall potential ( @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 at @xmath5 ) . like in the experiment , the particles interact through a repulsive dipole potential @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ` charge ' and @xmath8 the coordinate of the @xmath9 particle . for a given type of interparticle interaction and external confinement ,",
    "only three parameters characterize the order of the system : the number of big particles _",
    "@xmath0 _ , the number of small particles @xmath1 ( also called defect particles ) and the coupling parameter @xmath10 . in the experiment the diameter of the big particles is twice the diameter of the small particles  @xcite , therefore we have chosen the charge of the small particles to be @xmath11 of the charge of the big particles . as a representative example we will discuss in the following the results for clusters with 16 and 17 big particles .",
    "we define the characteristic energy of the inter - particle interaction for dipole clusters as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the average distance between the big particles . in the present calculation",
    "we define the coupling parameters as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 the temperature of the medium .",
    "the ratio of the particle velocity relaxation time versus the particle position relaxation time is very small due to the viscosity of water and consequently the motion of the particles is diffusive and overdamped . in our simulations",
    "we will neglect hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "following @xcite we rewrite the stochastic langevin equations of motion for the position of the particles as those for brownian particles : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the self - diffusion coefficient and @xmath19 is the particle mass of the @xmath20 particle , and @xmath21 is the randomly fluctuating force acting on the particles due to the surrounding media . in the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) we took a time step @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the density of the big particles .",
    "the radius of the circular vessel is @xmath24 @xmath25 m and the self - diffusion coefficient of the big particles @xmath26 @xmath25m@xmath27/s is taken from the experiment @xcite . as the self - diffusion constant is inversely proportional to the particle diameter ( from the stokes - einstein relation @xmath28 , with _",
    "@xmath29 _ the viscosity of the fluid and _ a _ the particle diameter ) we took @xmath30 for the small particles .    before starting the brownian dynamics",
    "we find first the groundstate configuration using the monte carlo technique as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to characterize the angular order of the system , we calculate the angular diffusion of the particles over a 30 min x 1000 time interval . the relative angular diffusion coefficient can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 refers to a time averaging , and the mean relative angular displacement rotation of the first shell @xmath33 $ ] relative to the second @xmath34 $ ] one is defined as @xmath35 - [ \\theta_1 ( t)]$ ] .",
    "the mean squared radial diffusion ( msrd ) coefficient is @xmath36/a_0,\\ ] ] which is a measure of the radial order in the system .",
    "the msrd is calculated separately for the big and the small particles .",
    "we found that all the interesting melting properties for small binary clusters are present in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 systems . in the insets of fig .",
    "[ res ] the ground state configurations for these systems are shown with zero ( ( a ) and ( e ) ) , one ( ( b ) and ( f ) ) , three ( ( c ) and ( g ) ) and six ( ( d ) and ( h ) ) small particles . in a @xmath39-particle system with less than @xmath40 small particles ( left column in fig .",
    "[ res ] ) , one can see that the big particles form a shell structure with @xmath41 particles in the inner shell and @xmath42 particles localized at the edge of the hard wall .",
    "the small particles fill up the vacancies between the big particles .",
    "the difference of charge between the big particles and the small particles is so large , that the small particles are expelled from the outer ring . the ( 4,12)-configuration is a magic number configuration and is exactly the same configuration as one finds without small particles  @xcite .",
    "( for @xmath40 or more small particles the magic configuration is lost and the big particles form a non - magic configuration . ) in a @xmath43-particle system ( right column in fig .",
    "[ res ] ) with no small particles , the big particles form the ( 5,12)-configuration .",
    "however , by adding 2 small particles to the system , the ground state configuration of the big particles changes into the ( 4,13)-configuration .",
    "the reason for this change in the ground state is that the ( 5,12)-configuration is a non - magic number configuration and by adding small particles the system tries to adjust to a more triangular lattice .    in order to study the melting of the binary clusters we performed brownian dynamics simulations for several values of the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "first we show how the angular melting properties change by adding small particles .",
    "afterwards we deal with the radial melting properties .",
    "the relative angular diffusion coefficients as function of @xmath10 for a system with @xmath39 and @xmath43 big particles for different number of small particles are shown in fig .",
    "we notice from fig .",
    "[ res](a ) , for the magic number cluster @xmath44 without small particles , that the relative angular diffusion curve starts to differ from zero around @xmath45 . for larger values of @xmath10",
    ", both shells do not rotate relative to each other ( i.e. they are locked ) , which is a typical behavior for a magic number configuration .",
    "one can see that adding small particles influences drastically the relative angular melting temperature : the value of the coupling constant @xmath10 at which the angular order between both rings is lost moves to smaller values .",
    "this is shown more clearly in fig .",
    "[ 16 ] : the black squares show the @xmath10 value at which the relative angular diffusion coefficient exceeds the value @xmath46 as a function of the number of small particles in a cluster consisting of 16 big particles .",
    "one can see that adding even a few small particles can reduce the critical @xmath10 value with a factor of ten .",
    "this leads to a first conclusion that _ adding small particles stabilizes angular order _",
    "( i.e. it increases the rigidity of the cluster ) . this unexpected increase in angular order",
    "is induced by the vibrations of the small particles .",
    "the vibrating small particles , which are mostly situated between the inner and outer shell , lock both shells with respect to each other and stabilize the angular order .",
    "notice the occurrence of a relatively large critical value of @xmath10 for @xmath47 small particles .",
    "this can be explained in terms of vacancies . between the big particles",
    "there are only @xmath48 vacancies .",
    "when @xmath47 small particles are added to the system , two small particles have to occupy the same vacancy ( see inset of fig .  [ res](g ) ) .",
    "this distorts the triangular structure and reduces the angular order , leading to a smaller angular melting temperature .",
    "if one increases the number of small particles further , the angular stabilization is restored .",
    "one can conclude that on average small particles stabilize the angular order , but the increase in angular melting temperature with respect to a cluster without small particles depends on the positioning of the small particles in the vacancies .    adding small particles does not only influence the angular melting temperature , but also the height of the plateau in the angular diffusion coefficient ( shown by the red triangles in fig .",
    "[ 16 ] at @xmath10=20 ) .",
    "the height of the plateau indicates how fast the shells are rotating with respect to each other .",
    "there exists an optimum number of small particles for this angular stabilization ( corresponding to a minimum in this curve ) , which in this case is obtained for @xmath49 at which the relative angular diffusion coefficient is reduced with a factor of two with respect to a system without small particles .",
    "note also that the small dip in the relative angular diffusion coefficient for the system without small particles around @xmath50 is a sign of the reentrant behavior as studied before in ref .",
    "@xcite and observed in the experiment of r. bubeck _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "next , we examine how these angular melting properties are modified for the non - magic cluster with 17 big particles ( see right column in figs .",
    "[ res ] and  [ 17 ] ) . without small particles ,",
    "the relative angular order is lost at much smaller temperatures than for a magic number configuration .",
    "adding one small particle does not affect this melting temperature substantially for this particular system , as it will sit in the center of the cluster .",
    "however , adding more than three small particles has an even stronger influence on the melting temperature for angular melting ( shown by the black squares in fig .",
    "[ 17 ] ) in comparison with the magic - number configuration .",
    "again we found an optimum number of small particles for angular stabilization , which in this case also occurs for 8 small particles ( see the minimum in the curve with red triangles in fig .",
    "[ 17 ] ) .     particles .",
    "black squares : critical @xmath10 where the angular diffusion of the big particles is exceeding the value @xmath46 .",
    "red triangles : height of the plateau of the angular diffusion curve measured at @xmath51 .",
    "green dots : height of the @xmath52 of the big particles measured at @xmath51 .",
    "pink pentagons : melt temperature of the small particles . ]      in order to describe the melting in the radial direction we calculated @xmath52 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath53 of the big particles in the binary cluster is shown by the black squares in fig .",
    "notice that the radial melting of the big particles sets in around @xmath54 which is independent of the number of small particles . in the limit of @xmath10 to zero ,",
    "@xmath52 approaches @xmath55 , which is exactly the theoretical limit for the @xmath52 of a system of completely uncorrelated particles in a cavity with hard walls .",
    "notice that the @xmath52 curve of the big particles in fig .",
    "[ res ] , exibits an increase of the inclination around @xmath56 as a function of the number of small particles . to analyze this further",
    ", we show in figs .  [",
    "16 ] and  [ 17 ] the @xmath52 of the big particles at @xmath51 as a function of the number of small particles ( green dots ) for @xmath39 and @xmath43 big particles , respectively .",
    "this @xmath52 curve shows a linear increase which can be understood as follows : as the angular motion of the big particles is tempered by the small particles , most of the kinetic energy of the particles is directed into the radial direction .",
    "summarizing we can conclude that the radial melting temperature of the big particles is independent of the number of small particles , but that the thermal fluctuations of the angular motion of the big particles is compensated by an increase of @xmath52 .",
    "but now for a cluster consisting of @xmath43 big particles .",
    "]    comparing the @xmath52 of the big particles with the @xmath53 of the small particles ( the red dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ res ] ) it is seen that the radial melting of the small particles sets in at a smaller temperature than the radial melting of the big particles .",
    "this confirms the experimental observation  @xcite that the small particles become delocalized at a larger value of the coupling constant than the big particles . from the @xmath52 of the small particles we notice that the radial melting of the small particles depends on the number of small particles .",
    "figs .  [ 16 ] and  [ 17 ] ( pink pentagons ) show the critical @xmath10 value where @xmath52 becomes larger than @xmath57 as a function of the number of small particles for a 16 and 17 particle system , respectively .",
    "the @xmath52 curves show that the radial melting temperature increases as function of the number of small particles .",
    "this is a consequence of the induced distortion of the triangular lattice by the small particles which is proportional to the number of small particles .",
    "the influence of this distortion is clearly visible in the @xmath52 curve ( pink pentagons in fig .",
    "[ 16 ] ) , just like for the angular melting temperature ( black squares ) .",
    "for @xmath47 small particles , at least @xmath58 particles have to occupy a single vacancy which distorts significantly the triangular lattice of the big particles in comparison to the occupancy of only @xmath59 small particle per vacancy .",
    "this leads also to a weaker pinning of the small particles and consequently a smaller melting temperature ( i.e. a larger critical coupling constant ) .",
    "since the interaction energy of the small particles ( with charge = @xmath60 ) is less than the interaction energy of the big particles , we can expect that the critical coupling constant at which the small particles melt is between 8 times ( for 1 small particle in the cluster ) and 64 times ( in the limit that the interaction is completely dominated by small particles ) the critical coupling constant for the big particles .",
    "one can verify in fig .",
    "[ res ] that this is indeed the case .",
    "an unusual behavior is found for the radial melting behavior of the small particles which is found not to occur in a single step .",
    "the @xmath52 ( red dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ res ] for @xmath39 and @xmath43 big particles ) increases suddenly at a specific @xmath10 value .",
    "however , it does not reach its maximum value immediately .",
    "this means that the small particles at this temperature do not move freely throughout the system , but hop between the vacancies . by further decreasing @xmath10 we even observe a decrease in the @xmath52 before it reaches the theoretical limit of @xmath55 , in which case the small particles move uncorrelated through the system .",
    "in contrast to the mono dispersive cluster where only an angular reentrant behavior was observed  @xcite , we find here a _ new reentrant behavior _ but now in the radial melting of the small particles .",
    "this reentrant melting occurs exactly at the @xmath10 value where the relative angular diffusion coefficient increases strongly .",
    "when at large @xmath10 the small particles temper the relative angular motion of the shells , we notice now that for smaller @xmath10 values it is the complete angular melting which restricts on its turn the radial motion of the small particles .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the melting behavior of a classical two - dimensional binary cluster .",
    "we showed that defect particles in such a binary cluster stabilize the angular order of the cluster .",
    "an optimum value for the number of small particles was found for this increased angular stabilization .",
    "this tempering of the angular motion of the big particles is compensated by an increase of the radial motion of the big particles .",
    "the melting process in a binary cluster takes place in several steps where first the small particles and then the big particles become delocalized with increasing temperature . due to the radial diffusion of the small particles , the relative intershell rotation of the big particles is reduced with respect to a system without small particles .",
    "further , with an increase of temperature , the diffusion of the big particles switches on that leads to the stabilization of the radial motion of the small particles and a reentrant behavior of the small particles occurs ."
