    "the past few years have witnessed an extremely prolific research effort in the experimental and theoretical investigation of ultracold molecules .",
    "the rapid development of techniques for cooling , trapping , and manipulating molecules at ultracold temperatures @xcite led recently to the creation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "this major achievement opens new perspectives in the exploration of the crossover regime between bec and bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluidity @xcite , as well as in the conception of qubits in quantum computers using electric dipole moment couplings between ultracold polar molecules @xcite .    among the wealth of techniques developed for producing ultracold molecules , photoassociation of ultracold atoms",
    "@xcite has proven its success in creating ultracold ( @xmath4k ) polar neutral molecules . indeed , using that technique , magneto - optical trapping of ultracold polar neutral ground state",
    "krb @xcite and nacs @xcite molecules , as well as formation of rbcs@xmath5 molecules from a laser - cooled mixture of @xmath6rb and @xmath7cs atoms @xcite were recently reported .",
    "exothermic chemical reactions and vibrational relaxation triggered by collisions are important factors limiting the lifetime of molecules created by photoassociation in highly excited vibrational levels @xcite .",
    "although collisional studies of ultracold molecules have been a matter of active research in recent years @xcite , relatively few progress has been reported on chemical reactivity of polar molecules at ultralow temperatures @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we report quantum scattering calculations for the @xmath8 reaction at cold and ultracold translational energies .",
    "since methods for cooling and trapping alkali metal atoms have reached high degree of sophistication and creation of bec of alkali metal atoms has become rather widespread , collisions of ultracold alkali metal atoms with polar molecules are being explored as a possible method for creating ultracold polar molecules . thus , cross sections for elastic and ro - vibrationally inelastic collisions of @xmath9 system are of significant interest .",
    "moreover , from a chemical dynamics point of view the @xmath9 collision is especially interesting due to the unusually deep van der waals minimum of about @xmath10 in the entrance channel of the collision .",
    "since @xmath11 involves the transfer of the relatively heavy f atom ( the @xmath12 channel is highly endoergic and is not open at low energies ) , it will be particularly interesting to see whether the reaction will occur with significant rate coefficient at ultralow energies .",
    "the @xmath9 reaction has been the topic of a large number of experimental and theoretical studies . after the pioneering crossed beam work of @xcite , the @xmath9 reaction became a prototype system for experimental studies of the `` harpoon '' mechanism in reactions between alkali or alkaline earth metal atoms and hydrogen halide molecules @xcite .",
    "thus , a large amount of experimental information has been reported for key observables such as integral and differential reactive cross sections @xcite . on the theoretical front",
    ", numerous quantum mechanical @xcite as well as classical trajectory @xcite scattering calculations have been performed on the ground state potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "the relative simplicity of the lihf system , with only 13 electrons , makes it very suitable for accurate _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "consequently , a rich variety of analytic global fits to the @xmath1 symmetry electronic ground state pes have been proposed . as mentioned above , one of the unique aspects of the lihf system is the rather deep van der waals well in both the @xmath9 and @xmath13 channels . unlike the well studied @xmath14 and @xmath15 systems where the van der waals well depth is about @xmath16 ,",
    "the van der waals well in the @xmath9 is an order of magnitude deeper , giving rise to long - lived collision complexes and narrow scattering resonances in the energy dependent reaction probabilities .",
    "the presence of the deep van der waals well in the @xmath17 entrance valley was confirmed by backward glory scattering experiment of @xcite and by spectroscopic measurements of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 lihf pess used in previous scattering studies were based on a relatively restricted sets of _ ab initio _ data , thus limiting the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "furthermore , the energy range investigated did not cover the translationally cold and ultracold regimes . here , we report quantum scattering calculations for @xmath18 collisions , for a total molecular angular momentum @xmath19 , using the recent high accuracy global pes of the lihf ground state calculated by @xcite .",
    "a brief review of the basic characteristics of the pes is given in sec .",
    "ii , together with a summary of the quantum scattering approach with illustrative convergence tests assessing the validity of our calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present state - to - state and initial - state - selected probabilities , cross sections , and rate coefficients for both reactive and non - reactive open channels of the collision .",
    "we discuss the effect of vibrational excitation on chemical reactivity at low temperatures and provide a summary of our findings in sec .",
    "calculations reported in the present study have been carried out using the recent lihf ground state pes of @xcite .",
    "this chemically accurate pes was computed for about 6000 nuclear geometries using internally contracted multireference configuration interaction ( mrci ) wave functions including all single and double excitations and davidson size consistency correction ( + q ) . a large atomic basis set was used to adequately describe the @xmath20 and @xmath21 ionic configurations responsible for the curve crossing leading to the lif products in the adiabatic representation of the electronic ground state .",
    "a saddle point results from the crossing between the @xmath20 ionic state and a covalent configuration correlating to @xmath17 . on the basis of these mrci+q results ,",
    "an analytic global pes was constructed using the modified many - body expansion of @xcite .",
    "major features of this pes are as follows : a @xmath22 deep van der waals well corresponding to the li@xmath23fh complex in the entrance channel due to strong dipole electric fields of the reagents followed by a saddle point at @xmath24 . the formation of the lif@xmath23h complex takes place in a late shallow van der waals well with a minimum at @xmath25 in the product valley , connecting with the @xmath26 products asymptote at @xmath27 .",
    "all energies are relative to the @xmath28 asymptote with energy @xmath29 corresponding to the bottom of the hf potential .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 reaction is endoergic with exclusion of the zero - point energy of the reactants and products .",
    "the reaction becomes exoergic with ground state reagents if the zero - point energy of the reactants and products is included .",
    "the exoergicity is @xmath30 with ground state reagents .",
    "the @xmath31 products lie at @xmath32 and this reaction channel is closed for the energy range covered in this study .",
    "quantum reactive scattering calculations have been performed using the abc program developed by @xcite .",
    "this implementation of the coupled - channel hyperspherical coordinate method solves the schrdinger equation in delves hyperspherical coordinates for the motion of the three nuclei on the parametric representation of a single born - oppenheimer pes with reactive scattering boundary conditions applied exactly .",
    "parity - adapted @xmath33matrix elements , @xmath34 , are computed for all the arrangements of the collision products for each given @xmath35 triple , where @xmath36 is the total angular momentum quantum number and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the triatomic and diatomic parity eigenvalues , respectively ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the usual diatomic vibrational and rotational quantum numbers and @xmath41 is the helicity quantum number for the reactants , their primed counterparts referring to the products .",
    "after transformation of the parity - adapted @xmath33matrix elements into their standard helicity representation , @xmath42 , initial state selected cross sections are calculated as a function of the kinetic energy , @xmath43 , according to @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the incident channel wave vector and the helicity quantum numbers @xmath41 and @xmath46 are restricted to the ranges @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "let us note that for zero total molecular angular momentum and @xmath49wave scattering in the incident channel , eq .",
    "( [ stscs ] ) merely reduces to a summation over the quantum number @xmath50 and @xmath51 .      at very low temperatures ,",
    "quantum tunneling becomes the dominant mechanism of chemical reaction when energy barriers are present . as a consequence ,",
    "the reaction probabilities are usually very small and particular care must be paid to the convergence of scattering calculations .",
    "we have performed extensive convergence tests of the initial - state - selected and state - to - state reaction probabilities with respect to the maximum rotational quantum number , @xmath52 , and cut - off energy , @xmath53 , that control the basis set size , the maximum value of the hyperradius , @xmath54 , and the size of the log derivative propagation sectors , @xmath55 .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath56 reaction probability is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for different values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "convergence with an accuracy better than @xmath57 was achieved over the range @xmath58 using the values @xmath59 and @xmath60 a more stringent convergence test consisted in the analysis of the product rotational distribution represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the same values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 as above were used to calculate the state - to - state reaction probabilities for @xmath61 at a fixed incident kinetic energy of @xmath62 . using the results obtained with @xmath63 and @xmath64 as a reference",
    ", similar accuracy was found using @xmath65 and a cut - off internal energy @xmath66 in any channel .",
    "the basis set corresponding to these values was composed of 771 local basis functions . as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates , the state - to - state reactive probability is particularly sensitive to the size of the basis set at low translational energies . on the basis of these convergence tests , values of @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 were adopted for the calculations reported hereafter .",
    "the initial state - selected reaction probability for lif formation in @xmath2 collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of the total energy .",
    "our results are presented along with the recent time - independent quantum coupled channel hyperspherical calculations of @xcite obtained with a scaled pes of @xcite .",
    "both sets of results are consistent with respect to the magnitude of the predicted probability , i.e. , both exhibit small values for the reaction probability .",
    "this merely reflects the fact that for collisions with hf molecules initially in their ground vibrational state the reaction proceeds mainly by quantum tunneling through the barrier .",
    "the unusually large well depth of the van der waals potential in the entrance valley effectively raises the reaction barrier , thus leading to small values of the reaction probability .",
    "our results confirm that there is indeed a dense resonance structure at low energies associated with quasibound states of the @xmath3 van der waals complex @xcite .",
    "however , the positions of the peaks predicted by our calculations are noticeably different from the quantum scattering results of @xcite as discussed by @xcite , the pes of @xcite used in most of the lifh dynamical calculations performed until 1997 , is based on a limited set of _ ab initio _ data and _ ad hoc _ modifications introduced to reproduce experimental properties resulted in artificial features in the pes . in addition , the total energy threshold for the time - independent calculations of @xcite is higher than our value of @xmath67 corresponding to the energy of the @xmath68 state",
    ". however , their time - dependent calculation carried out using wavepacket methods is in line with our prediction of the threshold position ( see * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig3 ] with the recent quantum mechanical scattering calculations of @xcite is also very revealing of the quantitative discrepancies introduced by the pes in dynamical studies at low temperatures .",
    "their time - independent quantum calculations using the variational method employed the global _ ab initio _ pes of @xcite .",
    "briefly , this ground - state pes is characterized by a reactant van der waals well at @xmath69 relative to the @xmath28 asymptote , followed by a saddle point at @xmath70 , a product van der waals well at @xmath71 and finally a product asymptote at @xmath72 .",
    "this potential also exhibits a second saddle point in the product valley at @xmath73 . compared to our results",
    ", the reaction probability obtained by @xcite for lif formation is smaller by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this reflects the effect of a @xmath74 higher barrier in the reactant channel as well as the presence of a second saddle point in the product valley of the pes of @xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  shows the state - to - state reaction probabilities for @xmath75 formation as a function of the product rotational quantum number , @xmath51 , in @xmath76 collisions . for a fixed incident kinetic energy of @xmath62 , 5 vibrational levels",

    "the probability for @xmath77 formation is larger for intermediate-@xmath51 product channels of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 vibrational levels .",
    "a broad peak centered at @xmath80 appears in the population distribution of these vibrational states , corresponding to an exoergicity of @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the reaction to @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "vibrational excitation of the reactants significantly increases the reaction probability , as can be seen from the comparison of fig .",

    "initial - state - selected cross sections for lif formation and for nonreactive scattering in @xmath83 collisions are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for incident translational energies covering the range @xmath84 .",
    "the reaction cross section is rather small for hf molecules initially in their ground vibrational state since quantum tunneling of the relatively heavy fluorine atom is the dominant reaction mechanism . for energies below @xmath62 , the reaction cross section reaches the wigner regime @xcite where it varies inversely as the velocity .",
    "however , a strong peak centered at @xmath85 is observed where the cross section increases by about six orders of magnitude .",
    "this feature suggests that reactivity may be more important at low temperatures than generally recognized . for translational energies beyond @xmath86",
    ", the reaction cross section is characterized by resonant spikes due to metastable states of the @xmath3 van der waals complex in the initial channel .",
    "nonreactive channels of the @xmath2 collisions are open only for translational energies larger than @xmath87 , thereby explaining the sharp rise in the nonreactive cross section at this value corresponding to the energy for rotational excitation to the first excited state of the product , @xmath88 . beyond this energy threshold ,",
    "nonreactive scattering becomes more favorable than lif formation , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . on the contrary , in @xmath76 collisions the reactive channel dominates the nonreactive processes , with a @xmath89 product branching ratio reaching 20 at low and ultralow temperatures .",

    "moreover , chemical reactivity is greatly enhanced by vibrational excitation . in the wigner regime , where cross",
    "section ratios become constant , the reaction cross section involving excited @xmath90 reactants are 635 times larger than for collisions with hf reactants in their rovibrational ground state .",

    "[ fig5 ] has been carried out by calculating the bound- and quasi - bound states of the @xmath3 van der waals potential that correlate with the @xmath91 manifold .",

    "the resonance energies and the corresponding wave functions are computed using the fourier grid hamiltonian method @xcite . for constructing the adiabatic potentials",
    ", we used a 20-term legendre expansion of the interaction potential , 25 angular orientations to project out the expansion coefficients , 17 gauss - hermite quadrature points for the vibrational wave functions and a grid of 1000 points for the atom - molecule separation .",
    "as reported in table [ tab1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the excellent agreement found between the energy eigenvalues and the peak positions from our scattering calculations suggests that peaks a to h in fig .",

    "the resonances correspond to quasibound states of the adiabatic potentials correlating with @xmath94 of the @xmath95 molecule .",
    "each of the adiabatic potential supports a number of quasibound complexes due to the relatively deep van der waals interaction in the entrance channel .",
    "only high - lying stretching vibrational states of the van der waals complex generate resonances for @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 , while low@xmath100 channels give rise to resonances for @xmath101 . however , we have not been able to assign the strong peak centered at @xmath102 to a reactant van der waals complex .",

    "the unusually large well depth of the van der waals potential in the entrance channel ( @xmath111 , relative to the @xmath28 asymptote of the pes ) effectively raises the reacton barrier and lead to small values of the reaction rate coefficients at low energies . for @xmath68 reactants , the rate coefficient reaches the wigner regime for temperatures below @xmath112 , with a constant value of @xmath113 in the zero - temperature limit .",

    "quantum reactive scattering calculations have been performed for the @xmath0 bimolecular scattering process for zero total angular momentum , at low and ultralow temperatures .",
    "the energy dependence of state - to - state and initial - state - selected probabilities and cross sections , as well as limiting values of the rate coefficients have been evaluated using the coupled - channel hyperspherical coordinate method . for @xmath2 collisions , our calculations , using the most recent pes for the lihf electronic ground state , clearly illustrate the dominance of the resonance tunneling mechanism due to the decay of metastable states of the li@xmath23hf van der waals complex in the entrance valley into the @xmath118 product manifold .",
    "comparison of our calculations with previous quantum scattering results emphasizes the extreme sensitivity of scattering matrix elements to the details of the pes and therefore the desirability for high accuracy analytic fits to correctly describe the collision dynamics and the interplay among the various energy modes in the cold and ultracold regimes .",
    "we also find that chemical reactivity is dramatically enhanced by vibrational excitation for cold and ultracold translational energies , with a 3-order of magnitude increase between the @xmath103 and @xmath104 rate coefficients in the zero - temperature limit , consistent with our findings for the @xmath119 and @xmath120 reactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results show that the lif formation dominates the nonreactive processes in @xmath76 collisions , with a @xmath89 product branching ratio reaching 20 at low and ultralow temperatures .",
    "the rich resonance features characterizing the energy dependence of the @xmath9 cross sections make the lihf system particularly attractive for the study of coherent control of resonance - mediated reactions .",
    "in fact , recent advances in the control of bimolecular processes have shown that cross sections resulting from scattering that proceeds via an intermediate resonance are exceptionally controllable @xcite .",
    "this offers new possibility for tuning chemical reactivity at the single quantum state level of resolution .",
    "the present study shows that vibrational excitation may be used to circumvent reaction barriers at cold and ultracold temperatures even when the reaction involves tunneling of a heavy atom such as fluorine .",

    "<S> quantum mechanical calculations are reported for the @xmath0 bimolecular scattering process at low and ultralow temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> calculations have been performed for zero total angular momentum using a recent high accuracy potential energy surface for the @xmath1 electronic ground state . for @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the reaction is dominated by resonances due to the decay of metastable states of the @xmath3 van der waals complex . </S>",
    "<S> assignment of these resonances has been carried out by calculating the eigenenergies of the quasibound states . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that while chemical reactivity is greatly enhanced by vibrational excitation the resonances get mostly washed out in the reaction of vibrationally excited hf with li atoms . in addition , we find that at low energies , the reaction is significantly suppressed due to the formation of rather deeply bound van der waals complexes and the less efficient tunneling of the relatively heavy fluorine atom . </S>"
