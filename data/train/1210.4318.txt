    "the development of general - purpose gpus , able to perform tasks done previously by central processing units ( cpus ) offers an attractive alternative for radio - astronomical applications .",
    "because the storage and off - line processing of such a vast amount of data is difficult and costly , the new generation of radio telescopes , such as lofar , requires high performance computing ( hpc ) solutions to process the enormous volumes of data that are typically produced during a survey for fast radio transients ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jones et  al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "real - time searches for radio transients , which use gpu technology to remove interstellar dispersion and detect radio bursts from astronomical sources in real - time are now possible .",
    "also it is important to note that real - time processing offers the chance to react as fast as possible and to conduct follow - up observations of any event .",
    "we report here on the installation of a new backend which can be used with a single international lofar station .",
    "the details of the lofar and pulsar observations with lofar can be found in @xcite and in kondratiev et  al .",
    "( these proceedings ) .",
    "artemis is a combined hardware / software backend , which attaches in a non - disruptive way to the lofar station hardware .",
    "the hardware consists of 4 12-core servers hosting high - end nvidia gpu cards .",
    "these servers are all fed data through a broadband ( 10 gigabit ethernet ) switch , which is also responsible for sending the data back to the netherlands during the normal international lofar telescope ( ilt ) operations .",
    "the data being processed adds up to a stream of 3.2 gbits / s , which consists of a sky bandwidth of approximately 48 mhz , sampled at 5 @xmath0 intervals , in two polarisations .",
    "real - time processing generally ensures that the 400 mb of data per second are reduced to manageable rates both for storage and further processing .",
    "the artemis servers can perform in real - time all the operations necessary to discover short duration radio pulses from pulsars and fast transients , thanks to a modular software structure operating in a c++ scalable framework developed at the university of oxford .",
    "artemis includes processing modules for receiving the data , further channelisation in finer frequency channels using a polyphase filter , generation of stokes parameters , excision of terrestrial radio frequency interference , temporal integration , real - time brute force de - dispersion using typically at least 2000 trial dispersion measure ( dm ) values and detection of interesting signals , in high - throughput cpu and gpu code .",
    "the gpu processing allows a full search in dm space up to a maximum dm as defined by arguments related to interstellar scattering and with the necessary dm resolution ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* armour et  al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "simulations show that typically a few thousand trial dms are sufficient to optimally sample the dm range within all lofar bands .    at present",
    ", gpu based artemis hardware exists at the international stations in the uk and france ( chilbolton and nanay ) .",
    "this allows these stations to take advantage of the most powerful technique of rejecting signals of terrestrial origin : the direct comparison of detections between distant sites , also referred to as anti - coincidence testing . both these stations can process the full available 48 mhz of beamformed data .",
    "in addition two test installations exist at the stations in jlich ( germany ) and onsala ( sweden ) , each able to process 12 mhz of sky bandwidth .",
    "the first gpu project with artemis has been to focus on the de - dispersion step in the transients pipeline .",
    "this is clearly the most computationally intensive part of the pipeline and a preliminary study of different technologies has proved gpus to be the most suitable accelerators for de - dispersion .",
    "figure[fig2 ] illustrates the speed - up that has been achieved using gpus and compares the fastest gpu algorithm on nvidia fermi and kepler based hardware .",
    "this work has led to development of the fastest de - dispersion code in the world , with rough estimation that the new kepler algorithm is over 2.5 times faster than previous fermi code .",
    "the shared memory algorithm in figure[fig2 ] has a maximum dm limit of 100 . with this limit a throughput of",
    "approximately 12  gb / s of lofar data can be achieved by the de - dispersion algorithm on a kepler k10 gpu .",
    "this dm limit can be relaxed by using a different algorithm , called the l1 algorithm , which can still comfortably process a 3.2  gb / s single station lofar data stream up to a dm of 500 on a k10 .",
    "it is estimated that with 10 nvidia k10 gpus the l1 algorithm could process a 127-beam tied - array with 2000 channels in each pencil beam to a maximum dm of 250 ."
