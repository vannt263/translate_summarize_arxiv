    "some exact anisotropy solutions have been also investigated in this bd theory @xcite . lately , hossienkhani @xcite investigated the interacting de scalar fields models in an anisotropic universe . consequently , it would be worthwhile to explore anisotropic de models in the context of bd theory . in this work we study",

    "( 7 ) we can observe the universe is accelerating expansion . in all , current data are unable to discriminate between the popular @xmath2cdm , frw and our interaction models .    , @xmath151 , @xmath81 , and the @xmath2cdm model , @xmath89 , @xmath151 and @xmath175 . ]",
    "in this work we studied the linear evolution of structure formation in interacting ghost de models within the framework of brans - dicke theory .",
    "first of all , we initiate our analysis by studying the effects of anisotropy on the background expansion history of the growth factor .",
    "we obtained the evolution of density parameter @xmath85 , the equation of state parameter @xmath51 , the deceleration parameter @xmath176 and the squared sound speed @xmath0 for both the ghost de and brans - dicke theory with respect to the cosmic redshift function . at first",
    ", the eos parameter of the ghost de and bd theory models in the case of @xmath177 , can not cross the phantom divide while it for @xmath178 can cross the phantom divide line . beside , increasing of the anisotropy and the interaction parameter is increased the phantomic . then , the evolution of the interacting ghost de density parameter in bd theory is depend on the anisotropy density parameter @xmath36 and the coupling constant @xmath54 . on the basis of the above considerations",
    ", it seems reasonable to investigate an anisotropic universe , in which the present cosmic acceleration is followed by a decelerated expansion in an early matter dominant phase . in other words",
    ", it indicates that the values of transition scale factor and current deceleration parameter are @xmath179 and @xmath180 for the case of ghost de , @xmath163 and @xmath164 for the case of ghost de with bd theory while for the case of @xmath2cdm model , @xmath181 and @xmath166 which is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "we have used the squared sound speed @xmath0 as the main factor to study the stability of the ghost de in bd theory . as a result , a bi universe filled with dm and ghost de component in bd gravity can lead to an unstable interacting ghost de dominated universe . in this case the frequency of the oscillations becomes purly imaginary and the density perturbations will grow with time .",
    "+ then , we analyzed @xmath1 and compare the results with observational data .",
    "we found that , by choosing appropriate values of constant parameters , we figure out our model has more agreement with observational data than @xmath2cdm .",
    "furthermore , we show that in anisotropic universe with ghost de of bd theory , the hubble parameter are bigger than the ghost de of frw , @xmath2cdm and @xmath43cdm models .",
    "it was observed that the larger the hubble expansion rate @xmath1 is taken , the bigger the anisotropy parameter @xmath36 can reach .",
    "finally the effects of anisotropy on the growth of structures in linear regime is investigated and we compared the linear growth in the ghost de and bd theory with the linear growth in the frw and @xmath2cdm models which in the @xmath2cdm , the growth factor evolves more slowly compared to the ghost de of frw in bd theory because the cosmological constant dominates in the late time universe . also , in the ghost de of frw in bd theory , the growth factor evolves more slowly compared to the ghost de models in anisotropic universe . therefore due to bd",
    "theory the growth factor @xmath101 for the @xmath2cdm universe will always fall behind the ghost de models in an anisotropic universe .",
