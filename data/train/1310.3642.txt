    "we present the latest results of a photometric follow - up study of faint cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ; see @xcite ) mostly in the southern hemisphere .",
    "specifically , in this paper we discuss the observations of 20 cvs identified by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; see @xcite ) .    this work forms part of a survey with the aim of characterising newly identified cvs , determining their orbital periods , searching for sub - orbital periodicities and selecting targets for in - depth studies on large telescopes and multi - wavelength campaigns . in the previous papers in this series ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the focus was on faint nova remnants and cvs identified by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it has shifted to cvs discovered by the crts @xcite .",
    "the crts is a large scale transient survey that observes 30@xmath0000 deg@xmath1 of the sky in search of transients ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they make use of data from the catalina sky survey @xcite , which searches for near - earth objects .",
    "the observing strategy is to observe a field four times at 10-minute intervals , then return to the field up to four times per lunation @xcite .",
    "transients are detected by looking for variations of more than 2 mag in the @xmath2 filter .",
    "as most of the fields have 7- to 8-year baselines and the crts can reach a depth of @xmath323 by co - adding images ( although individual pointings reach @xmath319 to 21 ) , a variety of transients are discovered . amongst these are supernovae , blazars , flare stars and cvs .    as evidenced by the number of cvs the crts has detected - more than 1000 to date (",
    "september 2013 ) - the crts is particularly efficient at finding them .",
    "this is for a number of reasons .",
    "for example , the magnitude variation cut - off limit of 2 mag , which was designed to restrict the number of artifacts and pulsating variables , is approximately the minimum amplitude of a dwarf nova outburst , so large numbers of dwarf novae ( dne ) are detected .",
    "this range also ensures that the high inclination systems with deep eclipses are detected , as well as a number of magnetic systems that show high and low states .",
    "as the crts commonly reaches down to @xmath321 , or fainter if the object has a high state brighter than this limit , it will find faint cvs such as the double degenerate am cvn ( am canum venaticorum ) systems .",
    "also advantageous to our photometric follow - up study , is the excellent coverage in the southern hemisphere .",
    "follow - up observations on the objects identified by large scale surveys , such as the crts , are becoming increasingly necessary as existing projects continue to detect new transients and surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) are planned . on average , from 2008 to 2012 the crts detected 45 new cvs per quarter . for cvs ,",
    "finding the orbital periods for a greater sample of systems is necessary for evolutionary studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , amongst the newly discovered cvs will be systems that need to be observed with larger telescopes ( e.g. , salt : woudt et al .",
    "2010 ) and multi - wavelength campaigns ( e.g. cc sculptoris : woudt et al .",
    "2012b ) . particularly important",
    "are the eclipsing systems , from which we can obtain system characteristics such as the mass ratio through eclipse deconvolution ( littlefair et al .",
    "2008 ; savoury et al .",
    "photometric surveys , such as the kind presented in this paper , help to identify these targets .    in this paper , in section",
    "[ sec : observations ] we describe the observing procedure , the instrumentation and the data reduction .",
    "the results of each of the individual cvs follow .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains a summary and discussion of the results .",
    "differential photometry was performed using the university of cape town ( uct ) ccd @xcite and the new sutherland high - speed optical cameras ( shoc ; @xcite , @xcite ) mounted on the 74-in and 40-in reflector telescopes of the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "for the first time in this series of papers , we have used the shoc systems .",
    "two instruments utilizing andor ixon 888 cameras are available for use at the saao .",
    "the field of view is 2.85x2.85 arcmin@xmath1 on the 40-in telescope and 1.29x1.29 arcmin@xmath1 on the 74-in , as compared to 1.23x1.82 arcmin@xmath1 and 0.57x0.83 arcmin@xmath1 on the uct ccd .    for these observations",
    "both the uct ccd and shoc were used in frame - transfer mode and shoc was operated in 1mhz conventional mode with 2.4 preamplifier gain .",
    "no filters were used , but the data were calibrated to the sloan @xmath4 photometric system .",
    "papers i to vi in this series used hot white dwarfs as calibration standards @xcite , which gave @xmath2 accurate to @xmath50.1 mag @xcite . using the survey archival data we compared the calibration offset using hot white dwarfs and those using sdss photometry of comparison stars on the target field on nights when both were available . over the range @xmath6=0.2 to 1.0 , it was found that there was a stable zero - point offset of 0.12@xmath70.05 mag between @xmath2 and sdss @xmath4 - which is consistent with the photometric transformation in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we calibrated our white light photometry to the @xmath4 photometric system using sdss stars on the target field that have @xmath6 colours in the range 0.2 - 1.0 .",
    "the calibration is accurate to @xmath50.1 mag . in the cases where",
    "a suitable calibration star was not observed over the course of the evening , we applied the calibration determined for another night during the observing run .",
    "the runs calibrated in this way are labelled with a colon in the observing log ( table [ tbl : log ] ) .",
    "the observing procedure varies according to the behaviour of a given cv .",
    "a target is initially observed for a few hours ( @xmath54 h ) .",
    "if the light curve shows modulation , then it is observed further over consecutive nights .",
    "if there are no modulations present or the cv appears to have a long orbital period ( greater than 5 hours ) , then no further observations are taken as the telescope time can be spent more profitably .",
    "longer - term monitoring ( weeks to years ) is carried out in order to reduce the error margin on orbital periods or to observe cvs in an alternate outburst state in order to obtain a superhump period , an orbital period or to examine quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) .",
    "data reductions were performed with the program duphot for the uct ccd @xcite and in iraf @xcite using standard reduction routines for the shoc observations .",
    "two different techniques were used to find periodicities ( such as the orbital period ) in the photometry .",
    "the cvs which had sinusoidal light curves were analyzed by fourier analysis using the starlink period package .",
    "those with non - sinusoidal light curves ( e.g. the eclipsing systems ) were analyzed by phase dispersion minimization ( pdm , @xcite ) .",
    "the former technique has been explained in detail in previous papers in this series .",
    "briefly , pdm determines the true period by folding the light curve on a series of test periods and determining which produces the least scatter . in order to quantify the scatter ,",
    "each folded light curve is binned and the overall variance of all the bins is divided by the variance of the unbinned data .",
    "the result - the pdm statistic @xmath8 - will be close to 1 for false periods and be small for true periods .",
    "a pdm periodogram will thus have local minima at the true periods ( see for example figure [ fig : css0116_pdm ] ) .",
    "full details are given in @xcite .",
    "the distinction in treatment between the non - sinusoidal and sinusoidal systems is due to the fact that in attempting to fit sharp features by a series of sinusoids , fourier analysis spreads the power to harmonics of the period , thereby reducing the power of the fundamental .",
    "pdm does not suffer from this problem .    unless otherwise stated , before the pdm periodogram or fourier transform ( ft ) is calculated , the individual runs are linearly detrended and mean - subtracted .",
    "this reduces the spurious noise at low frequencies introduced by observing the cv over the same airmass range over consecutive nights .",
    "in order to determine an uncertainty on the periods obtained from the ft , a sine - curve is fitted to the photometry using the ft period as an initial guess . by varying the period , a markov chain monte carlo method ( mcmc ) - specifically the metropolis hastings algorithm ( @xcite and @xcite ) -",
    "then samples the probability distribution of solutions .",
    "the median value and standard deviation of this distribution are then quoted as the period and uncertainty respectively . in cases where there are additional strong peaks in the ft ,",
    "more than one sine - wave is fitted simultaneously .    for those systems which have highly non - sinusoidal light curves ,",
    "the uncertainty can not be determined in this way .",
    "the uncertainty derived from pdm for these cvs is obtained by bootstrapping using the monte carlo algorithm for case resampling @xcite .",
    "the sampling distribution for the period is estimated by creating new light curves by selecting n of the n data points ( repetition is allowed ) and performing pdm on each new sample . as is the case for the ft ,",
    "the period and uncertainty given in this paper are the median and standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution .",
    "a variety of other techniques are used to select the correct period from the ft / pdm periodogram and determine the reality of a peak .",
    "these include phase - folding , using the window function - which shows the aliasing structure introduced by sampling - and the fisher randomisation test @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the amplitude values on the light curves are shuffled to create a large number of new light curves and fts are calculated for each .",
    "the probability of a period being real and equal to the quoted value on the original ft is then determined by looking at the proportion of shuffled light curves that gave a higher peak at that frequency .",
    "the observing log is given in tab .",
    "1 . each crts transient has an i d of the form css yymmdd : hhmmss@xmath7ddmmss .",

    "css1556 - 08 had a pre - determined superhump period ( @xcite and @xcite ) , but we could not determine an orbital period from our photometry .",
    "the remaining 2 cvs did not show any periodic modulations .",
    "most of the cvs were dne systems .",
    "this is as we should expect , as the crts identifies transients based on their variability .",
    "there was also a polar in the sample ( sss1944 - 42 ) , that was picked up by the crts because it showed high and low states that differed by more than a magnitude .",
    "the orbital periods of these cvs fall predominantly below the period gap ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , but there were two within the gap ( sss1128 - 34 and possibly css2054 - 19 ) and six above it .",
    "the predominance of cvs with periods below the period gap in the crts dataset is not fully explained .",
    "@xcite discussed this bias .",
    "they compared the cumulative distribution functions of the outburst amplitudes of the crts cvs and those in the survey region that were listed in rkcat @xcite that were not detected by the crts .",
    "they found that the crts shows a bias against low amplitude outbursts up to 6@xmath0mag .",
    "cvs with larger outburst amplitudes spend more time above the 2@xmath0mag cut - off limit that the crts employs and are thus more likely to be detected .",
    "furthermore , they plotted the outburst amplitude versus the orbital period for cvs within the crts footprint ( values from rkcat ) and found a trend for short period dne to have larger outbursts .",
    "combined , these two findings indicate that there is a bias in the crts towards shorter period systems @xcite .",
    "eight of the cvs in this sample were eclipsing systems . as mentioned in section [ sec : observations ] , the long - term crts light curves of the deeply eclipsing systems sometimes give indications of the eclipses .",
    "as each field is observed three times at 10-min intervals , it is possible that one or two of the observations are taken in eclipse .",
    "if it is sufficiently deep , these points can show up on the long - term light curve at a magnitude or more below the quiescent level .",
    "of the five systems with eclipse depths of more than 0.9@xmath0mag in our sample , four showed these characteristics .",
    "a number of the cvs presented in this paper provide promising targets for more in - depth studies with larger telescopes - such as the eclipsing systems ( css0116 + 09 , css0438 + 00 , css0449 - 18 , css1221 - 10 , sss1224 - 41 , sss1340 - 35 , sss2003 - 28 and css2108 - 03 ) , which through eclipse deconvolution can yield parameters such as the inclination and mass ratio .",
    "css1417 - 18 shows an unusually fast decline from outburst .",
