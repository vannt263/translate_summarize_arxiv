    "@xcite , where the fact that opposite - parity 2@xmath7 and 2@xmath8 states are near to cross for he - like ions with @xmath9 and @xmath10 was utilized . since that work , a number of authors considered he - like ions as very promising systems for investigating the pnc effects  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pnc effects in he - like ions can be significantly enhanced due to the near - degeneracy of some opposite - parity states . in a large number of proposals  @xcite",
    "the level crossing between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states of he - like ions was exploited .",

    "[ ris : sigma_pnc ] , @xmath95 is displayed as a function of the energy of the incident electron in the case of unresolved levels .",
    "[ ris : sigma_pnc ]    as one can see from this figure , the pnc cross section is mainly formed by the parity violation effect in the dielectronic recombination process ( third term in eq .",

    "nevertheless , the contribution from the subsequent radiative decay ( forth term in eq .  ( [ eq : sigma_pnc ] ) ) slightly enhances @xmath95 for the energy of the incident electron tuned in resonance with @xmath28 state .",

    "they are electrostatically accelerated to the energies of tens of kev that are required for the experiment .",
    "the cooler with a photocathode was constructed for instance for the tsr storage ring at the mpi - k heidelberg .",
    "such coolers can in principle be made to produce polarized electrons and they are now under consideration for the fair facility and for the cryring at gsi / darmstadt . the high electron energy definition in the rest frame of the ion is required to achieve the dr resonance .",
    "the electron beam energy spread depends on the collision energy @xmath134 and the transverse @xmath135 and the longitudinal @xmath136 temperatures of the electron beam : @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the laser - produced beams of electrons are intrinsically cold and can be further cooled using an adiabatic beam expansion technique .",
    "beams with a transverse temperature of 3.6  mev and a longitudinal temperature of 38  @xmath138 were produced in electron cooler devices @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the energy spread of a few ev at 90 kev can be experimentally achieved at present .",
    "this means that the dr resonance structure will be integrated out . to take full advantage of the enhancement of pnc in dielectronic recombination",
    "the electron energy spread must be made smaller than 0.1 ev at 90 kev , which is nowadays not possible . therefore further developments will be required to produce the electron beam that is cold enough .",
    "in addition , the ion beam momentum spread should be reduced below @xmath139 .",
    "this , however , was demonstrated at the storage ring esr albeit with a significant reduction of the beam intensity @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have considered the pnc effect on the cross section of the dielectronic recombination into the @xmath140 and @xmath141 states of heavy li - like ions .",
