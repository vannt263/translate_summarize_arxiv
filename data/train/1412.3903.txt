    "the fanaroff - riley class i radio galaxy @xcite 3c  120  ( @xmath2 ) is optically classified as a broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) .",
    "its broadband spectrum is dominated by the non - thermal jet emission along with a thermal disk component , hence this blrg is an ideal source to study the jet - disk connection .",
    "indeed , @xcite observed x - ray dips in 3c  120  followed by radio knot ejections through very long baseline array ( vlba ) monitoring .",
    "this was naturally interpreted as disk material suddenly falling onto its central black hole ( bh ) with some fraction ejected as a jet ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this jet - cycle paradigm in 3c  120  has been confirmed independently by multi - epoch x - ray spectroscopy combined with simultaneous uv and radio observations @xcite .",
    "the initial _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ? * ) detection of 3c  120  was reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the @xmath0-ray emissions of lat - detected blrgs ( 3c  120 , 3c  111 and pictor  a ) are most likely produced in the inner nuclear jets rather than large - scale jet structures , because these sources contain brighter radio cores compared to other blrgs not detected by the lat ( see also * ? ? ? * for 3c  111 ) .",
    "a major question is where the @xmath0-ray emission is located relative to the central bh .",
    "it has been assumed that a measurement of the variability timescale directly constrains the location of the emission if the jet is conical and the emission region roughly corresponds to the cross - sectional radius of the jet .",
    "however , the detection of rapid day - scale tev flaring observed in 2005 from m87 @xcite was determined to arise from the pc - scale knot known as hst-1 located at a projected distance of 65  pc from the central bh rather than the vlba core @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of rapidly variable ( doubling time of 10 minutes ) sub - tev emission from one of few tev - emitting flat spectrum radio quasars 4c + 21.35 also indicates that a very compact emission region of the order of 10@xmath3 cm is located at several pc from the bh to avoid @xmath4 annihilation with broad line region photons @xcite .",
    "therefore , the variability timescale does not necessarily directly relate to the jet dissipation location , and hence a multi - wavelength approach is crucial to determining the mev / gev @xmath0-ray production site .",
    "how powerful relativistic jets are launched from a supermassive bh is also a key issue regarding active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "a likely jet launching mechanism was presented by @xcite , who considered that bh rotational energy is extracted magnetically and converted to jet power .",
    "magneto - centrifugal force is also thought to drive the jet in part @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies have shown that rapidly rotating bhs in magnetically arrested accretion can efficiently generate relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we describe the observations and data reduction in  [ sec - data ] . based on the multi - wavelength results presented in  [ sec - results ] , we discuss the location of the jet dissipation region as well as the mev / gev @xmath0-ray emission mechanism in  [ sec - dis ] . the relation between the power in the jet and the disk is presented in  [ sec - dis ] .",
    "six years of _ fermi_-lat  ` p7rep ` data from 2008 august 4 to 2014 august 4 were analyzed using the fermi sciencetools v9r33p3 .",
    "we selected ` source ` class events using the instrument response functions ` p7rep_source_v15 ` within a 10@xmath5 region of interest ( roi ) centered at the radio position of 3c  120  ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in the energy range from 500  mev to 100  gev .",

    "the spectral shapes of the latter were fixed to their 2fgl values but the normalizations were set free .",
    "2fgl sources within the annulus of 10@xmath515@xmath5 were also included , but all of their parameters were fixed to their 2fgl values . by performing ` gtlike ` for the six - year accumulated data , we first found a test statistic ( see @xcite ) , @xmath10 for 3c  120  with power - law index @xmath11 and 0.5100 gev flux @xmath12 photons",

    "we determined the lat source position for 3c  120  using ` gtfindsrc ` and obtained r.a.=68.287@xmath5 and decl.=5.381@xmath5 ( 68% error circle radius 0.088@xmath5 ) which is only 0.028@xmath5 away from the radio position .",

    "this source was included in the source model during the lat analysis , in addition to the 2fgl sources .",
    "light curves and spectral data points were computed by dividing the data set in time bins ( 30 and 5 days ) or energy bins ( 3 logarithmic bins from 0.5 to 100 gev ) and fixing the parameters of all background sources ( except for the normalizations of two nearby sources which might be variable ) and leaving the normalization of 3c  120  free . in both cases , the spectral index of 3c  120  and",

    "we retrieved all available 43  ghz vlba data from the boston university monitoring program from 2012 january to 2013 december and analyzed the calibrated @xmath23 data using ` difmap ` .",
    "the intensity of the core was measured in images convolved with a common gaussian beam of @xmath24  mas to avoid resolution effects .",
    "we found a clear enhancement at epoch @xmath25 , which was followed by an ejection of a new jet component and decreasing core intensity in subsequent epochs . using the visibility - based model - fitting program in ` difmap ` to model the intensity structures , we found the new component was unresolved from the core on @xmath25 , but was clearly identified on the subsequent two epochs ( @xmath26 , 56398 ) .",

    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "this implies that a knot , responsible for the second @xmath0-ray flare , was passing through the core and hence the 43  ghz core flux increased around mjd  56600 , further supporting the physical connection between the @xmath0-ray and radio phenomena .",
    "the distance from the central bh to the vlba core was estimated to be @xmath1  pc by using the time lag between the x - ray dip and radio jet ejection @xcite .",
    "the apparent speed of the knot of @xmath29 derived here and the time lags of @xmath34 days and @xmath35 days between the @xmath0-ray and vlba core brightenings allow us to infer the position of the @xmath0-ray emission region under the assumption that these two phenomena are physically related .",
    "the knot moves a projected distance of @xmath36 and @xmath37  pc in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 days , respectively , while @xcite derived a projected distance of 0.22 pc from the central bh to the 43  ghz vlba core .",

    "here we assumed that the knot velocity is constant and if the acceleration of the knot takes place between the bh and vlba core , as speculated by e.g. , @xcite , the distance from the bh becomes larger , but still on the order of sub - pc .",
    "it is difficult to precisely determine a source variability timescale from the _ fermi_-lat  data due to the relatively low flux .",
    "but since the _",
    "fermi_-lat  sporadic detections are dominated by several 5-day bins ( see top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : lc_zoom ] ) , we assume here that the variability timescale is 510 days . the derived distance between the bh and @xmath0-ray emission region , together with the assumed variability timescale of 510 days and previously - measured beaming factor @xmath41 @xcite , allow us to estimate the jet opening angle .",
    "the radius of the emission region is estimated as @xmath42 cm . by assuming a simple conical shape for the jet structure , the jet half opening angle ( @xmath43 ) is estimated as @xmath44 , where the distance from the bh to the @xmath0-ray emission region , @xmath45  pc is assumed by taking the average of the two distances derived above .",

    "the synchrotron curve is largely unconstrained due to the sparse coverage with only 43 and 230  ghz measurements .",
    "however , @xcite reported a significant jet contribution to the mid - ir flux , in agreement with the modeling presented here .",
