    "the open nature of wireless channel gives rise to many wireless security problems .",
    "traditionally , wireless security is guaranteed through high layer encryption . with the development of interception technology ,",
    "encryption becomes more complex , leading to high computation burden .",
    "thanks to the physical layer security measures enlightened by information theory , we may exploit wireless channel characteristics to guarantee secure communications @xcite even without encryption .",
    "the performance of physical layer security is measured by secrecy rate , namely the capacity difference between the legitimate channel from the information source to the destination and the eavesdropper channel from the information source to the eavesdropper @xcite @xcite . as expected",
    ", the introduction of relay into physical layer security can improve the legitimate channel capacity through cooperative diversity , and thus enhances transmission security @xcite .",
    "some feasible relaying schemes and their performances were discussed in @xcite .",
    "relay positions were then optimized from the the perspective of minimizing the interception probability in @xcite .",
    "further , best relay selection was proposed to suppress the interception probability by exploiting selective gain in multiple relay systems @xcite .",
    "additionally , multiple relay cooperative beamforming combined with jamming was also adopted to maximize the secrecy rate @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the relay is equipped with multiple antennas , more effective relaying strategy can be used to optimize the secrecy rate @xcite .",
    "linear precoding schemes were investigated in a mimo relay network assuming global csi @xcite . nevertheless , due to the fact that the eavesdroppers are usually well hidden , it is difficult for the relay to obtain the knowledge of the eavesdropper channel .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to realize absolutely secure communications over the fading channel . under this condition , the conception of secrecy outage capacity was adopted to guarantee a secure communication with a high probability @xcite @xcite .",
    "a challenging problem rises when the eavesdropper is close to the information transmitter .",
    "even with a multi - antenna relay , the secrecy outage capacity is too small to fulfill the requirement of quality of service ( qos ) , due to the relatively high quality of intercepted signal .",
    "recently , it is found that large - scale mimo ( ls - mimo ) systems can significantly improve the transmission performance by utilizing its enormous array gain @xcite @xcite .",
    "inspired by this , we propose the use of an ls - mimo relay to enhance wireless security .",
    "note that a critical issue of the ls - mimo system is that channel state information ( csi ) may be imperfect due to duplex delay in time division duplex ( tdd ) systems , resulting in inevitable performance loss . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the performance analysis in terms of secrecy outage capacity in an ls - mimo relay system with imperfect csi under the amplify - to - forward ( af ) and the decode - to - forward ( df ) relaying strategies , respectively",
    ". the contributions of this paper are two - fold :    1 .   to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to introduce ls - mimo into a relay system , and solve the challenging problem of short - distance interception .",
    "we derive explicit expressions of secrecy outage capacity for af and df relaying systems , and then provide some guidelines for performance optimization .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give an overview of the ls - mimo relaying system employing physical layer security in section ii , and then derive the secrecy outage capacities based on af and df relaying strategies with imperfect csi in section iii . in section iv , we present some numerical results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme . finally , we conclude the whole paper in section v.",
    "we consider a time division duplex ( tdd ) ls - mimo relaying system , including one source , one destination equipped with a single antenna each and one relay deploying @xmath0 antennas in presence of a passive single antenna eavesdropper , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xmath0 is usually quite large in such an ls - mimo relaying system , i.e. @xmath1 or greater .",
    "the system works in the half - duplex mode , so the information transmission from the source to the destination via the aid of the relay requires two time slots .",
    "specifically , in the first time slot , the source transmits the signal to the relay , and then the relay forwards the post - processing signal to the destination during the second time slot . note that the direct link from the source to the destination is unavailable due to long distance .",
    "meanwhile , the eavesdropper monitors the transmission from the relay to the destination , and tries to intercept the signal .",
    "following @xcite , we also assume that the eavesdropper is out of the coverage area of the source , since it thought the information comes from the relay .",
    "we use @xmath2 to denote the channel from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the source , the relay , the destination and the eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the distance - dependent path loss and @xmath9 is the channel small scale fading . in this paper , we model @xmath9 as gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "@xmath8 remains constant during a relatively long period and @xmath9 fades independently slot by slot .",
    "thus , the receive signals at the relay in the first time slot can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the normalized gaussian distributed transmit signal , @xmath12 is the transmit power at the source , @xmath13 is the additive gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance at the relay . through post - processing to @xmath14 according to the csi @xmath15 and @xmath16 ,",
    "the relay forwards a normalized signal @xmath17 to the destination with power @xmath18 , then the received signals at the destination and the eavesdropper are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the additive gaussian white noises with zero mean and unit variance at the destination and the eavesdropper .",
    "assuming the legitimate channel and the eavesdropper channel capacities are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , from the perspective of information theory , the secrecy capacity is given by @xmath25^+$ ] , where @xmath26^+=\\max(x,0)$ ] @xcite . since there is no knowledge of the eavesdropper channel at the source and relay , it is impossible to provide a steady secrecy capacity .",
    "in this paper , we take the secrecy outage capacity @xmath27 as the performance metric , which is defined as the maximum rate under the condition that the outage probability that the transmission rate surpasses the secrecy capacity is equal to a given value @xmath28 , namely @xmath29",
    "in this section , we concentrate on the analysis of secrecy outage capacity of physical layer security in an ls - mimo relaying system . considering that af and df are two commonly used relaying strategies , we study the two cases in sequence .      in this case , the relay forwards the signal @xmath30 via multiplying the received signal @xmath14 by a @xmath31 processing matrix @xmath32 , namely @xmath33 we assume the relay has full csi @xmath15 by channel estimation , and gets partial csi @xmath16 by via channel reciprocity in tdd systems . due to duplex delay between uplink and downlink , there is a certain degree of mismatch between the estimated csi @xmath34 and the real csi @xmath16 , whose relation can be expressed as @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the error noise vector with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) zero mean and unit variance complex gaussian entries .",
    "@xmath37 , scaling from 0 to 1 , is the correlation coefficient between @xmath34 and @xmath16 .",
    "a large @xmath37 means better csi accuracy . if @xmath38 , the relay has full csi @xmath16",
    ". additionally , due to the hidden property of the eavesdropper , the csi @xmath39 is unavailable .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 is designed only based on @xmath15 and @xmath34 , but is independent of @xmath39 . considering the better performance of maximum ratio combination ( mrc ) and maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) in ls - mimo systems , we design @xmath32 by combining mrc and mrt .",
    "specifically , the received signal @xmath14 is combined with an mrc vector @xmath40 , and then normalized by a scaling factor @xmath41 , and finally multiplied by an mrt vector @xmath42 . in other words ,",
    "the processing matrix is given by @xmath43 thus , the received signal at the destination and the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) can be expressed as @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "based on the receive snr in ( [ eqn10 ] ) , we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 1 _ : the legitimate channel capacity in an ls - mimo relaying system in presence of imperfect csi can be approximated as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the spectral bandwidth .",
    "please refer to appendix i.    it is found that the legitimate channel capacity is a constant due to channel hardening in such an ls - mimo relaying system .",
    "similar to ( [ eqn10 ] ) , the snr at the eavesdropper is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence , according to the definition of secrecy outage capacity in ( [ eqn5 ] ) , we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 2 _ : given the outage probability bound by @xmath28 , the secrecy outage capacity based on the af relaying strategy is @xmath54 .",
    "please refer to appendix ii .    based on theorem 2 ,",
    "we may obtain the interception probability @xmath55 , namely the probability that the legitimated channel capacity is less than the eavesdropper channel capacity . by letting @xmath56 in ( [ app4 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath57      different from the af relaying strategy , the df decodes the receive signal at the relay , and then forwards the original signal to the destination , so as to avoid noise amplification . also by using the mrc technique at the relay , the channel capacity from the source to the relay",
    "can be expressed as @xmath58 where ( [ eqn13 ] ) holds true based on channel hardening when @xmath59 .",
    "then , the relay performs mrt based on the estimated csi @xmath34 .",
    "the channel capacity from the relay to the destination is given by @xmath60 where ( [ eqn14 ] ) is obtained similarly to theorem 1 .",
    "thus , the legitimate channel capacity under the df relaying strategy can be expressed as @xmath61 it is found that @xmath62 is also a constant due to channel hardening in an ls - mimo system .",
    "meanwhile , the eavesdropper intercepts the signal from the relay , the corresponding channel capacity can be computed as @xmath63 for the secrecy outage capacity in an ls - mimo df relaying system , we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 3 _ : given the outage probability bound by @xmath28 , the secrecy outage capacity based on the df relaying strategy is @xmath64 .",
    "please refer to appendix iii .",
    "similarly , we can also obtain the interception probability in this case .",
    "let @xmath65 in ( [ app9 ] ) , we have @xmath66",
    "to examine the accuracy of the derived theoretical expressions of the secrecy outage capacity for the ls - mimo af and df relaying systems , we present several numerical results in the following scenarios : we set @xmath1 , @xmath67khz and @xmath68 .",
    "the relay is in the middle of a line between the source and the destination .",
    "we normalize the path loss as @xmath69 and use @xmath70 to denote the relative path loss .",
    "for example , if @xmath71 , then the eavesdropper is closer to the relay than the destination .",
    "in addition , we use snr@xmath72 and snr@xmath73 to represent the transmit signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in db at the source and the relay , respectively .",
    "firstly , we testify the accuracy of the theoretical expression in af relaying mode with snr@xmath74snr@xmath75db . as seen in fig.[fig2 ] , the theoretical results are well consistent with the simulations in the whole @xmath70 region with different outage probability requirements , which proves the high accuracy of the derived performance expressions . given the outage probability bound by @xmath28 , as @xmath70 increases , the secrecy outage capacity decreases gradually , this is because the interception ability of the eavesdropper enhances due to the short interception distance .",
    "in addition , given @xmath70 , the secrecy outage capacity improves with the increase of @xmath28 , since the outage probability is an increasing function of the secrecy outage capacity .        secondly , we show the impact of snr@xmath76 on the secrecy outage capacity in af relaying mode with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and snr@xmath79db . as seen in fig.[fig6 ] , the secrecy outage capacity is not an increasing function of snr@xmath76 , since both the legitimate and eavesdropper channel capacities improve as snr@xmath76 .",
    "thus , it makes sense to find the optimal snr@xmath76 to maximize the secrecy outage capacity in ls - mimo relaying systems .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    thirdly , we investigate the impact of @xmath37 on the secrecy outage capacity in af relaying mode with snr@xmath74snr@xmath75db and @xmath77 .",
    "the csi mismatch will result in the performance loss .",
    "however , in ls - mimo relay systems , when the number of antennas is quite large , the impact of csi mismatch can be weakened due to high spatial resolution . as shown in fig.[fig4 ] , the performance loss by reducing @xmath37 from 1 to 0.8 is slight .",
    "in other words , the af relaying scheme is insensitive to the csi accuracy .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    then , we testify the accuracy of the derived theoretical expressions based on df relaying mode with snr@xmath74snr@xmath75db . as seen in fig.[fig3 ] , the theoretical results coincide with the simulations nicely .",
    "similar to the af relaying mode , the secrecy outage capacity decreases as @xmath70 increases and @xmath28 reduces .",
    "note that , compared to the secrecy outage capacity of af relaying mode in fig.[fig2 ] , the secrecy outage capacity of df relaying mode is better under the same conditions , since the df mode avoids amplifying the noise at the relay .",
    "next , we investigate the impact of snr@xmath76 of the secrecy outage capacity in df relaying mode with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and snr@xmath79db . from fig.[fig7 ] , as snr@xmath76 increases , unexpectedly the secrecy outage capacity decreases .",
    "this is because the legitimate channel capacity is independent of snr@xmath76 when snr@xmath76 is large , but the eavesdropper channel capacity is an increasing function of snr@xmath76 .",
    "hence , it is also necessary to choose an optimal snr@xmath76 to optimize the performance .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we show the impact of @xmath37 on the interception probability based on df relaying mode with snr@xmath74snr@xmath75db and @xmath77 . as seen in fig.[fig5 ] , although the interception probability increases as @xmath37 decreases , the performance gap is nearly negligible , so the df relaying scheme has high robustness .",
    "a major contribution of this paper is the introduction of the ls - mimo relaying technique into physical layer security to significantly enhance wireless security , especially when the interception distance is short .",
    "this paper focuses on the analysis of secrecy outage capacity under the af and df relaying strategies , and derives the closed - form expressions in terms of the transmit snr and the channel condition .",
    "altogether , these results provide some important guidelines for performance optimization of physical layer security in ls - mimo relaying systems .",
    "based on the snr @xmath80 at the destination , the legitimated channel capacity can be expressed as @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the real part of @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath16 is replaced by @xmath84 in ( [ app1 ] ) .",
    "( [ app2 ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath85 scales with the order @xmath86 as @xmath59 while @xmath87 scales as the order @xmath88 , which can be negligible .",
    "( [ app3 ] ) holds true because of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , namely channel hardening @xcite .",
    "therefore , we get the theorem 1 .",
    "according to ( [ eqn5 ] ) , given @xmath28 , we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath93 . in order to derive the secrecy outage capacity ,",
    "the key is to get the cdf of @xmath93 . examining ( [ eqn11 ] ) , due to channel hardening , we have @xmath94 since @xmath95 is an isotropic unit vector and independent of @xmath39 , @xmath96 is @xmath97 distributed with 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "let @xmath98 , we can derive the cdf of @xmath93 as @xmath99 if @xmath100 , then we have @xmath101 since @xmath102 is impossible when @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 hence , we get the theorem 2 .",
    "similarly , according to the definition of secrecy outage capacity in ( [ eqn5 ] ) , we have @xmath105 where ( [ app9 ] ) follows the fact that @xmath106 is @xmath97 distributed with 2 degrees of freedom as analyzed earlier . based on ( [ app9 ] ) , it is easy to get the theorem 3 .",
