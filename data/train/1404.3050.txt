    "observations at the rhic and lhc suggest that an extremely dense partonic medium , most probably quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , with nearly perfect fluid properties has been formed at the extreme temperatures and energy densities produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions . as the experimental precision was instantly improving , it became obvious soon that the description of the data on relativistic heavy ion collisions required some degree of qgp viscosity ( for review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical works on strongly coupled quantum field theories , which utilize results from superstring theory , have established a lower limit of about @xmath4 for the specific shear viscosity @xmath5 of the qgp @xcite .",
    "here @xmath6 is the shear viscosity and @xmath7 is the entropy density in the system .",
    "qgp shear viscosity is an important parameter characterizing the qgp medium .",
    "one of the possible ways to extract the qgp viscosity is to confront the data with the macroscopic model calculations . here",
    "the shear viscosity , or rather @xmath5 ratio , is inserted as a free parameter in the hydrodynamic part of the code .",
    "its value is fixed after providing the best agreement with the data .",
    "the most successful approaches , however , combine a viscous fluid dynamic description of the qgp phase with a microscopic boltzmann simulation of the hadronic phase @xcite . for instance , vishnu model @xcite matches the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional , longitudinally boost - invariant viscous hydrodynamic algorithm vish2 + 1 @xcite to the well - known urqmd cascade model @xcite as an afterburner . in a similar approach , music+urqmd @xcite ,",
    "the evolution is fully ( 3 + 1)-dimensional .",
    "calculations within this model , performed with the ip - glasma initial conditions @xcite together with an average value @xmath8 for @xmath0-@xmath0  collisions at the lhc and a somewhat smaller value @xmath9 for @xmath10-@xmath10  collisions at top rhic energies , provide a good description of all presently available data for charged hadron flow harmonics , both @xmath11 and @xmath12 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 @xcite , including their centrality and @xmath1- dependencies .",
    "usually this approach is called the viscous hydrodynamic hybrid model .",
    "other methods link the @xmath5 ratio to the system parameters , such as temperature and partonic cross section , which can be obtained from the analysis of particle spectra .",
    "the eccentricity scaled integrated elliptic flow @xmath15 versus transverse charged - particle density @xmath16 is a `` universal '' function , since this function describes energy and centrality dependencies of the flow in a wide range of collision energies .",
    "it is also less sensitive to the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions .",
    "there are many examples of application of this `` universal '' function for data analysis , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one can also note a good agreement with the numerous experimental data on @xmath15 as a function of @xmath17 from 7.7agev to 2.76atev for the monte carlo glauber ( mc - gl ) initial conditions in contrast to the kharzeev - levin - nardi ( mc - kln ) ones  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors suggest a simple equation for the `` universal '' function as a function of transverse particle density within the incomplete equilibration medium ( iem ) approach .",
    "this equation was directly used in @xcite to extract the iem parameters from the rhic data at 200 agev .",
    "to our best knowledge , no similar analysis of the lhc data has been done yet .",
    "hadrons , as well as partons , produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions interact further with their neighbors , thus developing a collective flow which has both isotropic and anisotropic components .",
    "the strength of the collective anisotropic flow is measured by means of harmonics of the fourier expansion of the charged hadron azimuthal distributions with respect to the event plane , defined by the maximum particles in direction of the harmonic studied .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of the particle yield can be written in terms of the harmonic expansion @xcite @xmath18 } \\right\\}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the azimuthal angle with respect to the event plane @xmath20 , and @xmath11 is the fourier coefficient . in this paper",
    "a parameter @xmath21 , dubbed elliptic flow , is considered .",
    "elliptic flow was studied extensively at both lhc @xcite and rhic @xcite energies .",
    "its description is amenable to hydrodynamic calculations @xcite .",
    "comparisons to theoretical results indicate that at the lhc energies most of the flow is primarily generated during an early stage of the system evolution before the hadronization , and the relative impact of the late hadronic stage is weak .",
    "an integrated elliptic flow can be expressed as @xmath22 several methods have been developed to extract the elliptic flow from the experimental data . in present paper",
    "we utilize the approach described in the cms publication @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies of elliptic flow were also focused on the quantifying of the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density of the produced medium in the framework of viscous hydrodynamics @xcite with a variety of possible initial conditions . in the theory of strongly interacting systems @xcite for the case of isotropic cross section and massless particles the qgp shear viscosity @xmath6",
    "is related to the scattering cross - section @xmath23 via the equation @xmath24 in natural units system , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "there are also higher order calculations extended up to the 16th order that do not change the obtained result @xcite . for the gluonic qgp which obeys the boltzmann distribution , the entropy density is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the qgp medium density and @xmath29 is the gluon degeneracy .",
    "thus , the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density may be written as    @xmath30    we assume that the anisotropic flow is formed until the freeze - out of the fireball and it is not changed further by the final - state interactions of hadrons .",
    "therefore , we need to know @xmath31 , which can be obtained from the experimental data .",
    "we used the standard statistical hadronization model ( shm ) with the modification factors from the urqmd @xcite to fit the yields of identified charged hadrons produced in @xmath0-@xmath0  collisions at @xmath32 = 2.76tev .",
    "data are taken from the alice experiment at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the resulting value of the temperature of chemical freeze - out , @xmath33mev , is compatible with that at rhic energies and expectations from the lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the features of analysis of the azimuthal harmonics on the event - by - event ( e - by - e ) basis are sketched in sec .",
    "[ sec : ebye ] .",
    "the model of incomplete equilibration medium ( iem ) is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "section  [ sec : ellipflow ] presents details of our analysis of experimental data and main results obtained for parton - medium cross section and share viscosity - to - entropy ratio .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : summ ] .",
    "the event - by - event analysis was implemented by atlas collaboration to study the azimuthal harmonics in @xmath0-@xmath0  collisions at @xmath34 = 2.76 tev , see @xcite . here",
    "the density distribution @xmath35 was unfolded by the standard bayesian procedure .",
    "it was shown that the true parameters density distribution did not depend on experimental extraction methods such as event plane , cumulant or two particle correlation with the triggering particle .",
    "the e - by - e analysis also excludes nonflow contributions . if @xmath21 is understood as the hydrodynamic response to the initial anisotropy , @xmath36 , of the initial density profile , then @xmath37 . in @xcite",
    "the authors suggested a simple functional elliptic power form of the initial state without assuming any particular model of the initial conditions , which fitted eccentricity density distribution better than gaussian or bessel - gaussian distribution .",
    "the elliptic power distribution of eccentricity reads @xcite @xmath38 the probability distribution of anisotropic flow , @xmath35 , is related to the distribution of the initial anisotropy @xmath39 via @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a response parameter . below we will use the notation @xmath42 .",
    "deviation from the local equilibrium can lead to an indicative dependence of the eccentricity scaled elliptic flow on charged particle multiplicity .",
    "local equilibrium is not a necessary condition for the elliptic flow , but it is commonly accepted that deviation from the equilibrium can only reduce the magnitude of the effect .",
    "degree of thermalization in the fluid , produced in heavy ion collisions , can be characterized by the dimensionless parameter , knudsen number @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the knudsen number @xmath44 is defined by evaluating the mean free path @xmath45 at average qgp life time @xmath46 , with the transverse medium size , @xmath47 , and the speed of sound in ultrarelativistic medium , @xmath48 . by definition , @xmath49 is the mean number of collisions per particle ( also known as `` opacity '' ) ; thus the ideal hydrodynamic limit corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "hence , @xmath51 , where @xmath23 is the effective parton - medium ( mostly gluon - gluon ) cross section and @xmath52 is the ( time - dependent ) density of the medium for a typical time @xmath53 .",
    "the inverse knudsen number @xmath49 can be determined from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "it is proportional to transverse particle density at midrapidity @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the multiplicity density , an indicator of the number of collisions per particle at the time when elliptic flow is formed , and @xmath56 is a square of the transverse area of the collision zone .",
    "therefore , the inverse knudsen number reads @xmath57 in the incomplete equilibration medium ( iem ) model the measured ratio @xmath15 is related to the knudsen number by a simple equation suggested in @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "local thermal equilibrium is achieved if @xmath60 .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath61 is estimated from the monte - carlo simulation of transport equations @xcite . as seen in eq.([eq:2 ] ) , using the known values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we can extract from the experimental data two parameters @xmath64 and @xmath23 , or , alternatively , the combined parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the success of iem model , which gives the universal function , is caused perhaps by a fact that the physical uncertainties of the individual parameters @xmath62 , @xmath23 , and @xmath63 are canceled out in their product , @xmath66 .",
    "elliptic flow develops gradually in the system as the system evolves . measured value of @xmath21 is formed at the final stage of hydro evolution at the temperature of freeze - out",
    ". the quantities that we shall extract from iem model should be interpreted as the averages over the transverse area s , and over some time interval around @xmath46 , which is the typical time scale for the build - up of @xmath21 in hydrodynamics .",
    "there are several works @xcite , where eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is applied for the parameter extraction .",
    "first analysis of the experimental data for @xmath10-@xmath10  and @xmath67-@xmath67  collisions at @xmath68gev within the iem model was made in @xcite .",
    "the authors determined parameters @xmath69 and @xmath23 for different initial conditions , such as mc - gl and mc - kln ones . later on , in @xcite the eq .",

    "for the analysis we use the experimental data on the azimuthal anisotropy in @xmath0-@xmath0  collisions at @xmath73tev obtained with the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the final data sample ( with all the necessary cuts applied ) contains 22.6 million minimum - bias events , corresponding to the integrated luminosity of approximately 3 @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath21 coefficient is determined as a function of charged particle transverse momentum @xmath1 and overlap of the colliding nuclei ( centrality ) in the pseudorapidity region of @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , with @xmath77 being the polar angle relative to the counterclockwise beam direction .",
    "we analyze the integrated elliptic flow in the measured transverse momentum range of @xmath78 @xmath1 @xmath79@xmath80  and extrapolate it to the region @xmath81",
    "@xmath1 @xmath82@xmath80  .    the collective motion of the system and , therefore , the anisotropy parameter depends on the initial shape of the nucleus - nucleus collision area and the fluctuations in the positions of the interacting nucleons . by dividing @xmath21 to the participant eccentricity , one may potentially remove this dependence across centralities , colliding species , and center - of - mass energies , thus enabling a comparison of results in terms of the underlying physics driving the flow .",
    "two initial state definitions are used in mc - gl and mc - kln models .",
    "initial state in the mc - kln model @xcite is based on the color glass condensate ( cgc ) concept @xcite accounting for the fact that at very high energies or small values of bjorken @xmath83 the gluon density becomes saturated at very high values .",
    "the cgc model predicts eccentricities that exceed the glauber - model ones by a factor of about 1.2 , with some deviations from this value in the most central and the most peripheral collisions @xcite , and a bit different behavior of the initial overlap area @xmath56",
    "@xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that only in mc - gl model the excellent universal curve propagates over the entire collision energy range between 7.7  agev and 2.76  atev for the eccentricity scale depending on @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , we use the glauber model , which is a multiple - collision model treating a nucleus - nucleus collision as an independent sequence of nucleon - nucleon collisions ( see @xcite and references therein ) , to calculate the participant eccentricity @xmath85 and its cumulant moments @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the variances of the participant spatial distribution and @xmath89 is the covariance . the participant eccentricity is evaluated in a frame that maximizes its value .",
    "this frame , which defines the initial - state participant plane , may be shifted and rotated with respect to the frame defined by the impact parameter vector and the beam direction . from the glauber model , we also calculate the transverse overlap area of the two nuclei @xmath90 . the table of eccentricities @xmath36 and overlap area @xmath56 for each centrality can be found in  @xcite . to restore the elliptic flow the event plane ( ep )",
    "method is employed . here the two - particle positive and negative event planes , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are determined by correlating the signals in the hadron calorimeter hf+ @xmath93 and hf@xmath94 @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the elliptical anisotropies are measured by correlating particles from the negative ( positive ) @xmath6 range of the tracker , i.e. , @xmath96 to @xmath91 @xmath97 .",
    "the factor @xmath98 corresponds to a resolution correction , which needs to be applied to the event plane .",
    "a gap of three units in @xmath6 is kept to reduce the contamination of non - flow effects .    in @xcite",
    "the isotropic parameter @xmath21 was measured at @xmath99 in the region @xmath100@xmath80  .",
    "now we extrapolate the integrated value of @xmath21 for every centrality to the region @xmath101@xmath80  , using the extrapolation of the normalized spectrum @xmath102 at each centrality by power - law dependence and polynomial of 5-th order fit to @xmath103 in the region @xmath104@xmath80  . such procedure allows us to calculate the integral value of @xmath21 by using eq .",
    "( [ intr_eq:2 ] ) in the region @xmath105@xmath80  .",
    "the eccentricity scaled integrated elliptic flow , @xmath15 , extracted by the two - particle cumulant method is nearly identical to the flow obtained by the event - plane method , provided the corresponding eccentricity fluctuations are taken into account . in the centrality range of 15  40% , the four - particle cumulant measurement of @xmath106 is also in agreement with the other two methods .",
    "the main difference in the results obtained by different methods can be attributed to their sensitivity to nonflow contributions .",
    "because of some irregularities of eccentricity @xmath107 for very central and for peripheral collisions , we do not include the four - particle cumulant in the analysis of transverse particle density in present work .",
    "we have also recalculated @xmath108 from @xmath109 at @xmath110 . under the assumption of region mid - rapidity ,",

    "the eccentricity - scaled elliptic flow is constant over a broad range of impact parameters .",
    "the deviations from this behavior are expected in peripheral collisions , in which the system freezes out before the elliptic flow fully builds up and saturates @xcite . a weak centrality and beam - energy dependence",
    "is expected through variations in the equation - of - state . in addition , the system is also affected by viscosity , both in the sqgp and in hadronic stages  @xcite of its evolution . therefore , the centrality dependence of @xmath118 can be used to extract the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density of the system .",
    "it was previously observed @xcite that the @xmath15 values , obtained for different systems colliding at varying beam energies , scale with the charged - particle rapidity density per unit transverse overlap area , @xmath119 , which is proportional to the initial entropy density .",
    "in addition , it was pointed out @xcite that in this representation the sensitivity to the modeling of the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions is largely removed , thus enabling the extraction of the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio from the data via the comparison with viscous hydrodynamic calculations .    in fig .",
