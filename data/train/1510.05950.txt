    "@xmath104 , therefore it does not treat parton fragmentation subprocesses ( here @xmath104 includes one or two coloured partons that fragment ) ; for this reason , we concentrate on the direct production of diphotons , and we rely on the smooth cone isolation criterion proposed by frixione  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) which is defined by requesting @xmath105 with a suitable choice for the function @xmath106 . this function has to vanish smoothly when its argument goes to zero ( @xmath107 ) , and it has to verify , if one possible choice is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is typically chosen as @xmath110 .",
    "this condition implies that , closer to the photon , less hadronic activity is allowed inside the cone .",
    "when the parton and the photon are exactly collinear ( at @xmath111 ) , the energy deposited inside the cone is required to be exactly equal to zero , and the fragmentation component ( which is a purely collinear phenomenon in perturbative qcd ) vanishes completely .",

    "that is the main advantage of this criterion : it eliminates all the fragmentation component in an infrared - safe way .",

    "while the resummation performed in this work reaches nnll accuracy formally only for the diphoton transverse momentum distribution , its predictions can be extended to other observables as well , since at least the leading logarithmic contributions have a common origin from soft and collinear emission .    in fig .",
