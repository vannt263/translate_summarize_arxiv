    "an overwhelming majority of the matter within our solar system has a unique @xmath2o/@xmath8o isotopic signature .",
    "however , a collection of presolar grain samples feature peculiar oxygen isotopic ratios .",
    "these outliers are found within the trove of presolar grains gathered over the years from primitive meteorites and interplanetary dust particles .",
    "this study is motivated by observations of presolar grains that nucleated in the atmospheres of distant , evolved stars before the formation of the sun .",
    "these grains retain the isotopic ratios of the stellar surface they originated from . during the birth of the sun ,",
    "most presolar grains were annihilated as gas and dust collapsed to form the nascent star . as the solar system cooled and the sun ascended the main sequence , the presolar grains that survived were incorporated into primitive meteorites .",
    "the study of their abnormal isotopic ratios provides crucial constraints for astrophysical models .",
    "this paper focuses on oxide grains referred to as @xmath9 grains , approximately 15@xmath10 of all presolar oxides",
    "they exhibit a characteristic @xmath2o/@xmath8o abundance ratio @xmath11.5@xmath1110@xmath12  @xcite , reflecting a substantial @xmath2o depletion  @xcite with respect to the solar value , ( 2.09@xmath13)@xmath1110@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "it has been hypothesized that asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are an @xmath2o depletion site  @xcite . during the agb stage  the final phase of nucleosynthesis during the evolution of a 0.8@xmath148.0 m@xmath0 star  @xcite  a star undergoes substantial nucleosynthesis and mass loss .",
    "peeling away the surface layers enveloping an agb star reveals numerous burning sites and a complex interplay between these regions .",
    "a stellar core , composed of electron degenerate carbon and oxygen , is surrounded by alternately burning helium and hydrogen shells . during periods of helium - burning ,",
    "referred to as thermal pulses , thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) occurs and drives convection between the two burning sites .",
    "when the tnr subsides , the star compensates for this period of activity by expanding and cooling .",
    "the hydrogen burning shell is quenched during expansion , and the convective envelope dredges the products of nucleosynthesis to the surface of the star ( third dredge - up ) .",
    "after this dredge - up event , the star contracts , and the hydrogen shell reignites .",
    "this interplay between the helium and hydrogen shells repeats episodically  @xcite .    during the agb phase",
    ", @xmath2o depletion may occur due to @xmath3 ( cbp )  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath15 process was proposed by  @xcite to account for isotopic anomalies , including @xmath2o depletion , in presolar grains . during cbp",
    ", material circulates between the convective envelope and the radiative zone that separates the envelope from the hydrogen burning shell .",
    "the base of the convective envelope remains cool , thus distinguishing this process from @xmath16 that occurs in 4@xmath147 m@xmath0 agb stars  @xcite .",
    "as the circulated matter approaches the hydrogen shell , it reaches temperatures high enough to destroy @xmath2o via hydrogen burning .",
    "the processed material is then recirculated into the convective envelope and transported to the stellar surface .",
    "grains nucleate in the stellar atmosphere depleted in @xmath2o due to processes that occurred deep within the star .",
    "then , powerful stellar winds inject these grains into the interstellar medium .",
    "the mechanism driving cbp is not understood , and several explanations have been proposed , including magnetic buoyancy  @xcite , gravity waves  @xcite , shear instability  @xcite , meridional circulation  @xcite , and convective overshoot  @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath2o depletion in some presolar oxide grains and agb stellar atmospheres helped motivate the introduction of cbp into agb stellar models .",
    "these models provided some insight into the class of agb stars that might experience cbp and the temperature of the stellar plasma at the site of this extra mixing . according to  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath2o depletion by cbp may occur in 1.5@xmath141.7  m@xmath0 agb stars .",
    "cool bottom processing models resulted in stellar plasma temperature regimes within low - mass agb stars that could allow for @xmath2o  +  @xmath4 reactions to occur . according to  @xcite , a temperature in excess of 39.8@xmath1444.7  mk ( depending on the evolution of the core , hydrogen burning shell , and convective envelope boundaries ) is sufficient for @xmath2o depletion during cbp in a 1.5  m@xmath0 model star .",
