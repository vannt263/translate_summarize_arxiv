    "mwc560 is a symbiotic binary star with an unusual spectrum distinguished by strong variables absorption lines of hydrogen and singly ionized metals .",
    "the absorption components of the lines in the spectrum of mwc560 are detached ( like bal quasars ) in a sense that there is a portion of undistorted continuum between the absorption and the emission lines .",
    "tomov et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have found a shift of these absorptions up to @xmath21  km / s , which is close to the parabolic velocity of the white dwarf , a likely component in the system .",
    "tomov et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have proposed a model of jet in mwc560 directed along the line of sight , in which high  velocity absorptions are formed . for the detached absorption components to appear ,",
    "the radial velocity dispersion in the jet must be considerably lower than the jet spread velocity .",
    "in symbiotic stars jets are known to be observed ( livio , 1996 ) .",
    "it is supposed that one of the principal conditions for generation of jets is the presence of an accretion disk ( livio , 1996 ) . a photometric flickering ( tomov et al . , 1996 )  a typical feature of all cataclysmic variables in which gas accretion by a white dwarf with a magnetic field occurs ( robinson , 1976 )  is evidence of the accretion in mwc560 .",
    "it is apparent that for the jet gas absorption lines to appear in the spectrum , the gas must be projected onto a continuous spectrum source , that is , the mwc560 accretion disk axis and therefore the orbital axis of the binary system must be close to the line of sight .",
    "the absence of noticeable variations in the radial velocities of the emissions lines ( tomov et al . , 1994 )",
    "does suggest such an orientation of the mwc560 orbit .",
    "a host of absorption lines of the jet ( of feii and other elements with a low excitation potential ) form a pseudo - continuum in a uv spectrum . from the modelling of this spectrum shore et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have obtained the column density in the jet to be @xmath22  @xmath23 for this object being at a maximum uv luminosity ( in the spring of 1990 ) and @xmath24  @xmath23 at a minimum ( in the autumn of 1990 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a spectral monitoring of mwc560 in 19901993 and describe the behaviour of the high - velocity absorption lines , that may be essential for the understanding of their origin .",
    "we show that the observed spectrum of the object is formed with involvement of absorption in the jet both in the lines and in the balmer continuum .",
    "further we model the continuous spectrum with allowance made for the jet absorption and find the parameters of the hot component and the jet .",
    "from october 1990 to february 1993 we obtained about 50 spectra of mwc560 on the 6-m telescope .",
    "the observation were carried out with the spectrograph sp-124 and the ipcs  a tv scanner ( drabek et al . , 1986 ) and with the echelle spectrograph ",
    "zebra  and the panoramic ipcs  quantum  ( gazhur et al . , 1990 ) . a spectral range of 37007000   was recorded with a resolution @xmath25/@xmath26@xmath25  @xmath27 and 2300 , an average exposure time for a single spectrum of 20@xmath28 , and a signal - to - noise ratio of 1030 .",
    "the time distribution of the observations allowed us to study a spectral variability from 10@xmath28 to a week .    in accordance with tomov et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we use the numbering of observing seasons which are determined by visibility of the object for ground - based observations .",
    "the first season refers to the first half of 1990 , when the absorption lines in the spectrum of mwc560 showed a maximum velocity and suffered a strong variability from night to night ( even disappeared ) ( tomov et al . ,",
    "our observations refer to seasons 24 .",
    "the dates of the observations and the mean parameters of the high - velocity absorption line @xmath29  in these seasons  the equivalent width @xmath30 , the residual intensity @xmath31 , the terminal velocity @xmath32 , determined from the blue wing , the velocity @xmath33  of centre of mass of the line , and the width at half intensity fwhm  are given in table 1 .",
    "a few typical for these seasons spectra in the region containing @xmath34and @xmath29lines are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the spectra reduced for a flat field are given in readout ipsc units .",
    "it is seen in the figure the high  velocity absorption lines behaviour a time goes on .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     strong emission lines of hi and feii(42 ) , and deep variable absorption lines of these elements shifted bluward to @xmath35  km / s are prominent in the spectrum of mwc560 . besides those , high  velocity absorptions of d@xmath36 and d@xmath37 nai , hei and h and k caii lines are also presented in our spectra , the latter being as deep as the absorptions of hi lines ( see also tomov et al . , 1992 ) . in the 3d and 4th seasons broad and very deep hi absorptions lines are observed . in the 2nd and at the end of the 4th seasons",
    "the absorption line profiles resemble the pcyg  type profiles , which appeared as a result of decreasing gas velocity in the jet . the equivalent width of absorption lines @xmath3 , @xmath29  and @xmath34   are approximately equal , which suggest the absorption lines to be saturated , whereas the equivalent width of the emissions of these lines are an order different from one another .",
    "the widths of the emissions are 45 times less than those of the absorptions .",
    "the observed profiles , for instance , of the @xmath34  line are unlike those calculated for a spherically symmetric outflow ( e.g. see castor and lamers , 1979 ) .",
    "the equivalent width ratio of the @xmath34  absorption and emission lines is smaller than 0.1 , which requires the optical thicknes @xmath38 for a spherical wind ( castor and lamers , 1979 ) , nevertheless from the great absorption line depth it can be concluded that @xmath39 .",
    "the observed absorption lines do not resemble the absorptions formed in an anisotropic wind either as , for example , in the cataclysmic variable rwsex , in which the wind velocity amounts to 4300  km / s ( greenstein and oke , 1982 ) .",
    "so , the high  velocity absorption lines in the spectrum of mwc560 may be formed in a jet directed to the observer .    in fig .  2",
    "are shown the absorption line profiles of different elements , which have been obtained from the echelle spectrum of december 9 , 1992 .",
    "it is seen that the widths of the feii absorption lines are smaller than those of the hi absorption lines .",
    "the absorption lines feii  @xmath254924 and @xmath255018 may be blended with the absorption lines hei  @xmath254922 and @xmath255015 , respectively .",
    "the latter , however , are much weaker than the lines of iron since the intensity of other hei absorption lines are small .",
    "it can be seen from fig .  2 that the jet is inhomogeneous in both velocity and temperature .",
    "the intensities @xmath31  of the absorption lines hi are the same for different seasons , but for the end of the 2nd season .",
    "the decrease in @xmath31  and fwhm of the absorption lines in the spring of 1991 ( table  1 ) is due to the fact that the absorption lines are approached the emission lines .",
    "high excitation lines typical of symbiotic variables have not been revealed in our spectra .",
    "the time resolution for the study of variability from our spectra on different dates was from 10@xmath28 to 5@xmath40 .",
    "the quality of spectra on some dates was sufficient for 3  % of variability to detect .",
    "a daily variability of high - velocity absorptions with an amplitude of 1020  % was always observed , which is seek from fig .",
    "3 , where the behaviour of the @xmath34 , @xmath29  and @xmath3  absorption lines from the spectra taken from december 4 to 10 , 1992 is presented .    to demonstrate the variability",
    ", we show the differences between the spectra under the study and a reference spectrum , which is a sum spectrum over all the observations ( at the top in fig .",
    "however the fragment of the reference spectrum with the @xmath3  line is presented from the spectrum on december 9 to show more vividly the broad red wing of this line ( manifestation of the counter jet , see below ) .",
    "all the spectra have been reduced to residual intensities .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate a zero radial velocity and @xmath41  km / s ( @xmath42 for the @xmath3 ) .",
    "the profile variability of the high - velocity absorptions can be seen in all the spectra in the lines @xmath3 , @xmath29  and @xmath34 .",
    "the variability of the absorptions in the spectra on december 8 , which were obtained with an interval of 3 hours , can also be seen in the figure : the change in the intensity occurred simultaneously for the absorption lines @xmath34  and @xmath29  at @xmath43 and 1090  km / s .",
    "at the same time no changes in @xmath3  absorption were noticed , possibly because of the great optical thickness of this line . in the examples of the night - to - night variability",
    ", @xmath3  is markedly different from the lines @xmath34  and @xmath29 , whose absorption line profile variability is practically synchronous .",
    "the amplitude of the 3-hour s variability in @xmath34  and @xmath29  is not smaller than that of the night - to - night variability . in spite of the fact that occasionally the variability amplitude slightly exceeds the noise in the spectra the apparent synchronism of the variations in the @xmath34  and @xmath29  absorption line profiles makes this variability significant . on other nights no fast variability was noticed ,",
    "that is why the differences for night s sum spectra are only presented for these nights .",
    "a variability of high  velocity absorptions in the uv spectra at times of @xmath44 hours has been detected by michalitsianos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , while at times of about 1 hour  by fabrika et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . based on this variability",
    "we can estimate the jet length .",
    "taking the characteristic time of the variability to be @xmath45 hours and the gas velocity in the jet during the observations on december 1992 @xmath46  km / s we find @xmath47  cm .",
    "a broad red wing in the @xmath3  emission line is well visible on the spectra ; its width is comparable with the width of the absorption line ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the wing also shows variability from night to night ( fig .",
    "we suppose that in the red wing of the @xmath3  line the radiation of the jet directed away from us ( the counter jet ) manifests itself . this radiation may be shielded partially by the hot component of the system ( accretion disk ) .",
    "the excess in the red wing above the @xmath3  line core profile approximated by gaussian has an equivalent width of about 4  .",
    "the total luminosity in this wing is l(@xmath3 ) @xmath48 erg / s .",
    "here we have adopted the mean values of the following parameters ( see table  2 and fig .  5 below ) : the distance to mwc560  1.7 kpc , the interstellar extinction and the flux in continuous spectrum near @xmath3   about 1@xmath49 and @xmath50  erg/@xmath51s . on the basis of the specific emission measure in the @xmath3  line @xmath52  erg / s@xmath53ster , for the expected temperature in the jets @xmath54  k ( see table  2 ) , we obtain the emission measure : @xmath55  @xmath53 , where v is volume",
    ", @xmath56 is the electron density .",
    "here the inequality conforms to the fact that a part of the emission region is screened by the accretion disk and also that the optical thickness of the emitting gas may be @xmath57 . assuming that the jet is conical ( @xmath58 ) and using the jet length obtained from the time of variability , we can estimate the column electron density in the jet @xmath59 .",
    "assuming that the semi  opening of the jet in mwc560 is @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61  @xmath51 . below based on the modelling of the continuous spectrum of mwc560 we determine the total column density ( the number of protons @xmath62 the number of hydrogen atoms ) of the absorbing gas in the jet , @xmath63  @xmath23 .",
    "this has been derived for the jet directed toward us while the electron density @xmath64 has been found from observations of the counter jet .",
    "we have not any grounds to believe that the two jets differ in their properties , therefore it follows from these two values that the hydrogen ionization degree in the mwc560 jets @xmath65 , i.  e. the gas temperature @xmath66  k. note that this estimate of the ionization degree in the jets does not depend on the volume filling factor of the gas , i.  e. on whether the gas is in clouds or the whole volume of the jet is completely filled with the gas .",
    "the results of observations are in very well agreement with the idea that the mwc560 jets oriented close to the line of sight .",
    "it is natural to suppose that the jets are perpendicular to the accretion disk , i.  e. the axis of the jets is parallel to the angular momentum of accreted matter . from this",
    "it also follows that the orbital inclination angle is small . from the data of tomov and kolev ( 1997 ) that the radial velocity of the feii , tiii and of other metal emission lines is about 35",
    "km / s and does not change in time ; within an interval of more than 1000 days the radial velocities change by less than 4  km / s . on the base of ccd",
    "spectra taken later on the 6-m telescope e.l .",
    "chentsov ( private communication , 1997 ) has reported the amplitude of radial velocity variations of the emission lines to change less by 2  km / s , here again for a time of more than 1000 days .",
    "the metal emission lines are produced as a result of fluorescence of uv radiation ( shore et al .",
    ", 1994 ) and , apparently , belong to gas outflowing from the inner regions .",
    "thus , we can estimate the upper limit to the amplitude of orbital variability of radial velocities as 2k @xmath67  km / s .",
    "the orbital period of mwc560 determined by doroshenko et al .",
    "( 1993 ) from the data of archives and up - to - date photometry is 1930 days . assuming the masses of the white dwarf and the giant to be @xmath68 ( see the discussion below ) , we find the orbital velocity @xmath69  km / s and the restriction on the possible interval of the system s inclination angle value @xmath70 .",
    "the probability of finding a binary system with i@xmath71 is extremely low , therefore we may take i@xmath72 for the inclination angle of the system .    from modelling the continuous spectrum of mwc560 ( table  2 )",
    "we estimate the size of the uv radiation source of about ( 45)@xmath73  cm . for the observed absorption lines in the jet to appear , the size of the jet projection onto the sky plane ( in the jet where the absorbent is situated , @xmath74  cm ) must be larger than that of the source . from this condition",
    "it follows that @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account the inclination angle of the system ( and the jet ) , i  @xmath76 , we find that the semi  opening of the jet is @xmath77 . in the known symbiotic binary chcyg this parameter determined from radio observations ( taylor et al . , 1986 )",
    "is @xmath78 .",
    "the mwc560 jet opening angle can also be estimated based upon the jet absorption lines widths .",
    "this will be an upper limit to the value since along with the dispersion of trajectories of matter in the jet there are other mechanisms ( e.  g. the dispersion of gas ejection velocities ) that may contribute to the absorption lines broadening . the jet is inhomogeneous in both temperature and density .",
    "this follows from the the variability of the high  velocity absorption lines and from the fact that we observe absorptions of elements of essentially different excitation potentials ( feii , hei ) .",
    "collision of individual fragments of the jet at velocities of several hundred km / s must cause considerable temperature variations of the jet gas . from examples of detached pcyg profiles on the spectra of different dates in early 1990 ( tomov and kolev , 1997 ) we find that the ratio of the minimal width of the observed absorption lines to the maximal velocity of ejection on the same dates is equal fwzm/@xmath32  @xmath79 .",
    "so we have from this @xmath80 or @xmath81 . here",
    "the inequality conforms to the fact that the absorption line broadening is caused not only by the dispersion of trajectories of the gas motion but also by the dispersion of gas velocities in the jet .",
    "the spectrum of mwc560 is formed in the m45 giant star and the hot source of spectral class b5a0 ( zhekov et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "ir radiation has been noticed to be slightly variable on time scale of a few days , which is typical for late giants , although the mean brightness has not changed for several years ( zhekov et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "at the same time the optical brightness , especially the uv , is a subject to both rapid variability ( flickering ) and more considerable long - time variations ( tomov et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "zhekov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have found that the colours of the hot component do not agree with those expected from the accretion disk .",
    "however they disregarded a possible absorption by matter of the jet . at the column density of hydrogen in the jet @xmath82  @xmath23 ( shore et al . , 1994 )",
    "this absorption must be essential in formation of the observed spectrum in the uv and even in optics .",
    "therefore , the variable mass flux in the jet ( or even the variable gas velocity in the jet at a constant mass flux ) may be the cause of the radiation flux variability .    in fig .  4",
    "are shown the time dependences of the velocity @xmath33  and radiation fluxes of the object in the v band ( tomov et al . , 1996 ) and in the uv .",
    "a correlation is well seen in the velocity variations of the gas ejection and the uv flux .",
    "the flux from the object in optics also shows a similar variations , however the amplitude of the flux variations in the v band is small , and the relation between the two quantities may be more complicated .    by the fall of 1990 , in the 2nd observing season the mean outflow velocity in the jet dropped to @xmath33  @xmath83  km / s and became even lower in the spring of 1991 ( @xmath33  @xmath84  km / s ) .",
    "this was accompanied by a decrease in brightness to @xmath85 and by the reddening @xmath86 and a more dramatic fall in uv radiation intensity ( compared to the spring of 1990 ) . in the 3d season by the autumn of 1991 the velocity increased and kept increasing till 1992 . in 1992",
    "the luminosity was growing as well . between 1992 and 1993 the velocity was observed to decrease a little at the constant brightness of the star . further the velocity did not change much . in the period under study the object mwc560 was in a passive state , when the absorption lines had a minor variability as distinct from the very active state in the spring of 1990 , when the absorption lines were observed to be strongly variable ( tomov et al . , 1990 ) .",
    "the brightness variations in the passive state are also smaller than in the active one .    in the 2nd season in the spring of 1991 the velocity of the jet was by approximately a factor of 5 lower than the mean velocity in the periods that followed and by an order lower than the velocity in the 1st season .",
    "the cardinal changes in the uv spectrum took place too ( fig .",
    "the total uv intensity in the 2nd season was lower , than both in the 1st and in subsequent seasons , about 56 times as small , while in the range shorter than 1400   the difference was still greater ( maran et al . , 1991 ) and amounted to several dozen times .",
    "the uv spectrum in september 1990 , when the velocity of gas in the jet dropped to @xmath87  km / s , was similar to those of classical novae several days after the maxima .",
    "this type of spectra has been called  the iron curtain  ( shore et al . , 1994 ) : powerful unidentifiable emission features , which , in fact , are the portions of the continuum that remained after absorption of the strong uv multiplets of feii and other ions of low ionization potentials in moving matter . such dramatic changes in the uv were practicaly not reflected in the optical range , where these ions do not absorb .",
    "the strong variations in the uv were thus caused by the variations of the optical thickness of the absorbing gas , the real uv source luminosity was likely to be unchanged . since the redistribution of energy has not been observed , then this gas is optically thick only in the directions close to the line of sight , which is consistent with the jet outflow model .",
    "the variation of column density of absorbing gas between different states of uv brightness ( shore et al . , 1994 ) reflects the gas mass variation on the line of sight within the zone of ionization of principal absorbing agents .",
    "we suppose that the decrease in velocity of gas observed in the 2nd season caused the increase in @xmath88 .",
    "thus , physical conditions in the jet affect the shape of the uv spectrum of mwc560 .",
    "this will be shown by the spectrum modelling .",
    "from the absorption lines of tio thakar and wing ( 1992 ) have defined the spectral type of the giant in mwc560 as m45 .",
    "when modelling , we have used colours and absolute magnitudes of giants m4 and m5 from the data of lang ( 1992 ) .",
    "optical and uv spectra of symbiotic stars are peculiar , and for their explanation 4 models a hot radiation source are usualy used : 1 ) a hot star in a planetary nebula , 2 ) a hot surface of a white dwarf , at which permanent nuclear burning of accreted matter occurs , 3 ) an accretion disk , 4 ) a hot optically thick wind from a white dwarf .",
    "the models 1 and 2 are inconsistent with the fact that high excitation lines are not observed in the spectrum and with the high luminosity of the object ( table  2 ) .",
    "models 3 and 4 are likely to be more suitable for the discription of mwc560",
    ". the observed flickering may be evidence of a gas accretion onto a star with a magnetic field ( robinson , 1976 ) .",
    "the accretor in mwc560 is , apparently , a white dwarf since the maximal observed velocity of the gas outflow ( 6000  km / s ) close the parabolic velocity of a white dwarf .    the observed luminosity of mwc560 is an order lower than critical eddington luminosity .",
    "this suggests that the supercritical accretion disk can not be considered as the source of the jets . in the case of model 4",
    "the wind may be due to thermonuclear bursts of matter accumulated at the white dwarf surface in the process of accretion or a rotating magnetic field of the white dwarf acting like a propeller ( illarionov and sunyaev , 1975 ) .",
    "we have considered the models 3 and 4 for the hot component as an accretion disk in geometrically thin and locally blackbody approximations ( shakura and sunyaev , 1973 ) with a boundary layer ( lynden - bell and pringle , 1974 ) and as a sphere with blackbody radiation .",
    "the jet been modelled as a homogeneous hydrogen layer in a lte state , which absorbs radiation from the hot source .",
    "the velocity of gas motion was assumed equal to 1000  km / s .",
    "this velocity does not affect the shape of the continuum , but only slightly changes the position of the balmer jump .",
    "for the assumed temperatures of gas in the jet of mwc560 ( 500010000  k , see above and also shore et al . , 1994 )",
    "the following basic processes of absorption and scatter of continuous radiation have been taken into account : free - bound and free - free transitions of atoms and negative hydrogen ions , rayleigh scattering by hydrogen atoms and thompson scattering by free electrons . the model spectrum of continuous radiation has been obtained with allowance for interstellar extinction for which the approximations of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , odonnell ( 1994 ) and the value @xmath89 have been used .",
    "the model spectrum was compared with the observed spectrum which has been obtained from the ubv data of tomov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , jhk data of zhekov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( see references therein ) and uv data of iue observations of michalitsianos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and fabrika et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . from the uv data the fluxes near @xmath251470 and 3100   have been only used , where the continuum radiation is clearly seen between the strong absorption bands .",
    "we have chosen two uv flux states of mwc560 ( and corresponding to them the optical fluxes , see fig .",
    "4 ) : with the maximal flux  in the spring of 1990 ( michalitsianos et al . , 1991 ) and with the flux typical for the main , more quiet , state of the object ( fabrika et al . , 1991 )  in the autumn of 1991 .",
    "these two states correspond to the active and passive periods ( table  1 ) determined above on the basis of gas outflow velocities and brightness of the object .",
    "they are also different in variability of the star : in the active state the object is more variable . from examination fig .  4 and",
    "from analyzing of the moving absorption line profiles in different seasons ( e.g. tomov and kolev , 1997 ) it can be concluded that mwc560 actually exhibits a whole set of states .",
    "the transitions from one state to another may be rapid ( it can be only said about the transition time that it is shorter than a few months ) , but the characteristics of the object ( velocity in the jets , uv and optical brightness and variability amplitude ) change from a state to state continuously .",
    "so it could be more correctly to say about the object activity levels in different observational seasons than about the active or the passive states . nevertheless , for modelling the spectrum we have chosen two seasons corresponding to the two states of the object , hereafter passive and active .",

    "the photosphere of an optically thick wind conforms to the blackbody sphere model considered .",
    "this photosphere absorbs all direct photons from the white dwarf surface or from the inner regions , e.  g. from the magnetosphere .",
    "this may also account for the absence of a hard uv radiation and high excitation absorption lines in the spectra of mwc560 .",
    "such a wind may be arise 1 ) when the accretion luminosity exceeds the critical value , 2 ) as a result of thermonuclear burning or bursts at the surface of the white dwarf ( pachynski and zytkov , 1978 ) , and 3 ) as a result of propeller mechanism action .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of mwc560 is by an order lower than the critical one corresponding to electron scattering .",
    "if the hard radiation produced affects the unionized gas above the accretion disk , the critical luminosity , needed for gas acceleration , may be markedly lower .",
    "such a model requires an axially - symmetric cocoon to be created above the internal parts of the accretion disk , which , by itself , suggests the presence of other mechnisms for destruction of the disk and gas acceleration . in continuous termonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the surface of the degenerate star , to ensure the observed luminosity @xmath139/y",
    "is needed , however the mechanism of gas ejection is absent . with thermonuclear burst",
    "the luminosity in a burst may well be higher than the eddington luminosity necessary for outward acceleration of gas .",
    "for the dramatic luminosity variations in the bursts to be obscured from the observer , the time intervals between the bursts must be much shorter than the time of radiation emergence from under the photosphere , i.e. @xmath140 s. however the intervals between the bursts with the accretion rates being discussed amount to dozens of years ( pachynski and zytkov , 1978 ) , therefore the thermonuclear model of gas acceleration in mwc560 is not suitable .",
    "we suggest that matter is accelerated by propeller mechanism .    in a number of papers devoted to investigation of mwc560 ( e.g. tomov et al . , 1994 ) it is assumed that in the passive state the white dwarf accretes gas under propeller condition , while in the active state ( e.  g. in periastron the rate of accretion onto the magnetosphere rises and , correspondingly , the magnetosphere size is reduced ) the star become the accretor .",
    "however it is not specified how matter is ejected from the accretor .",
    "for instance , in the well  known polars , where gas is accreted onto the surface of the white dwarf , no powerful , all the more jet  like outflow of matter is observed .",
    "as we have seen , the gas accretion rate in mwc560 is much lower than the critical , moreover , neither luminosity nor gas accretion rate onto the magnetosphere changes considerably in different states of this object .",
    "we have found above that in different activity states of the object only the gas ejection velocity changes essentially . besides , in the active state the gas velocity is strongly variable , accordingly the brightness variability amplitude increases . what is more , in the active state the luminosity of the uv source is two times higher . to achieve the observed luminosity of mwc560 the required rate of accretion onto the surface of the white dwarf of a radius @xmath141  cm and of mass 1m@xmath109 equals to @xmath142/y in the active state and @xmath143/y in the passive . when matter is propelled outwards from a magnetosphere ,",
    "a part of it may reach the white dwarf s surface , thus ensuring the observed luminosity .",
    "we suppose that the white dwarf in mwc560 always is under the propeller condition .",
    "we interprete the different activity levels of the object as different propeller regimes : the active state of mwc560 corresponds to the hard propeller , while the passive one to its soft regime .",
    "we will discuss this model in more detail below , but first refine the parameters of the hot component , the jet and the system mwc560 .",
    "it is highly probable that the uv radiation source around the white dwarf of mwc560 is the photosphere of the powerful wind outflowing from the internal regions .",
    "let us discuss observational evidences for the existence of this wind .",
    "the optical and uv spectrum is well described by blackbody radiation from a spherical object with temperature of @xmath132  k and radius of @xmath133  cm ( table  2 ) . along with the detached high  velocity variable absorption lines the low  velocity hydrogen absorption lines are always present ( irrespective of the state of the object ( tomov and kolev , 1997 ) ) , which make the line profile of the type pcyg .",
    "the velocity of outflow of gas in which these lines are formed is practically constant and is @xmath144  km / s for the high members of balmer series ( tomov and kolev , 1997 ) .",
    "the depth of these lines is varied : in the passive periods ( for example , early 1991 ) the high  velocity absorptions are getting closer to the low  velocity absorptions and merge , the total absorption lines intensity increases .",
    "the low  velocity absorption lines may well be formed in the quasi ",
    "spherical wind being discussed .",
    "the width of the narrow metallic emission lines as well as the emission components of the high balmer members is fwhm  @xmath145  km / s ( tomov and kolev , 1997 ) .",
    "these lines are probably emitted just above the photosphere of the wind , the metallic lines are formed due to fluorescence of uv radiation ( shore et al . , 1994 ) .    for the wind to be formed with the parameters",

    "for the active state of the object ( model bb1 ) @xmath119 turns out to be the same as for the passive state . as we have noted above",
    ", the mass loss rate in the jet as well as the size and temperature of the photosphere of the hot component appear to be constant ( within the accuracy of the obtained model parameters ) and do not depend on the state of activity of the object .",
    "we consider this fact to be of importance and it must be taken into account when selecting a model of the object and discussing the gas acceleration mechanism .",
    "one of the most important parameters , which characterizes the efficienty of the jet acceleration mechanism is the ratio of kinetic luminosity of the jets @xmath162  to bolometric luminosity of their source . in the case of mwc560",
    "the @xmath162/@xmath97  @xmath163 0.050.1 depending on the activity state of the object .",
    "if the gas outflow from the object was spherically symmetric , the kinetic luminosity would then be close to the bolometric one , which would be difficult to coordinate in the frames of the thermodynamics in any model of gas acceleration .",
    "this attests independently the the jet  like outflow of a gas in mwc560 .    at the matter accretion onto magnitosphere under the proppeler regime a part of material",

    "must be accreted onto the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "obviously , this is the upper limit of the rate of accretion onto the surface since part of radiation ( possibly , considerable ) is produced through heating and acceleration of gas by the propeller @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is an efficiency of the propeller mechanism .",
    "we can not estimate the value of @xmath166 , most likely @xmath167 . even in this case",
    "( see ( 3 ) ) the propeller heating furnishes more than 30  % of the uv source luminosity .",

    "day knowledge of the propeller mechanism operation at a gas accretion onto a rotating magnetic star ( see the rewiev of the problem in lipunov ( 1987 ) ) .",

    "this mechanism is also effective in accretion of interstellar gas onto main sequence magnetic stars ( fabrika and bychkov , 1988 ) .",
    "now we have to discuss the mwc560 binary system , i.  e. a possibility of accretion of the required mass from the wind of the red giant , the parameters of the white dwarf and it evolutionary status , and also possible mechanisms of collimation of the jets and causes of the different states of the object mwc560 .    to satisfy the observed propeller luminosity and the rate of mass ejection",
    ", the second star must lose not less than @xmath171/y .",
    "the average red giant mass loss rate in symbiotic variables is @xmath172/y ( mrset et al . , 1991 ) , but , probably , even more in active states .",
    "the separation between the components of mwc560 is @xmath173  cm , where as previously , we take @xmath174 , the orbital period of the system @xmath175 , and also the red giant mass @xmath176 , the mean value of which in symbiotic stars of s  type is equal to 1m@xmath109 ( whitelock and munari , 1992 ) . in",
    "long  period binaries the orbit is normally elliptical ( boffin et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "the probable eccentricity value for the mwc560 orbital period may be estimated at @xmath177 ( boffin et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "then the minimal distance between the components in mwc560 may be about @xmath178  cm . using this value and the expected mass ratio of the components @xmath179 , derive the minimal critical radius ( roche lobe ) @xmath180 ( pachinski , 1971 ) .",
    "the typical radius of m45 giants is , however , about @xmath181 ( lang , 1992 ) , i.  e. twice as small as @xmath182 .",
    "the atmosphere of a giant star is not stationary , it outflows irrespective of binarity , the second star only intensifies the outflow .",
    "therefore , and also taking into account possible uncertainty in the parameters , we can conclude that the giant star in mwc560 is capable of overflowing its critical roche lobe when the white dwarf is crossing periastron .",
    "the gravitational radius of material capture by the white dwarf when travelling on the orbit is @xmath183 .",
    "the orbital velocity of the white dwarf , as has been seen above , is @xmath184  km / s , the mean wind velocity of the red giants is @xmath185  km / s ( nugis et al . , 1989 ) . at these values of the parameters it is not difficult to find that @xmath186 .",
    "this means that independently whether the giant overfills its critical lobe , the white dwarf may capture and accrete nearly all matter being last by the giant .",
    "this inference can be backed up if one pays attention to the fact that the orbital velocity is comparable in value with the velocity of the wind outflow .",
    "the main portion of the gas lost can not leave the system , it must be captured by the white dwarf . from this , in particular , the important conclusion follows that the rate of the gas accretion onto the white dwarf may not be strongly varied with orbital phase .",
    "the same conclusion has been drawn above , based on modelling the continuous spectrum of mwc560 .",
    "it is possible that in a system having such parameters the accretion regime ( disk or spherical ) may alternate depending on the orbital phase .",
    "for instance , at periastron the giant may overfill its critical roche lobe  an accretion disk is formed , in the opposite point of the orbit a white dwarf  gathers  gas of the slow wind  spherical accretion could be possible . to be precise ,",
    "depending on the phase of the orbit , changes the specific angular momentum of matter captured by the white dwarf .",
    "so the pressure of gas falling onto the magnetosphere is also changes , which may cause alternation of the propeller action conditions .",
    "the propeller mechanism of a gas ejection by a star s rotating magnetic field has been first suggested for neutron stars by shvartsman ( 1970 ) and has been developed in a number of other works ( illarionov and sunyaev , 1975 ; shakura , 1975 ; halloway et al . , 1978 ;",
    "wang , 1979 ; davies et al . , 1979 , davies and pringle , 1981 ) ( see lipunov , 1987 ) . despite the vast study of this problem",
    "no reliable propeller model has been created as yet .",
    "the nonlinearity makes the problem difficult to resolve .",
    "it is supposed that zones of sectorial gas outflow are formed around the propeller , or nonstationary gas ejection occurs when accretion is replaced by outflow . in some propeller scenaries envelopes or disks",
    "may be formed round the magnetosphere .",
    "it is evident that the propeller ejects gas and carry away angular momentum of the star , however , to define concretely the picture of accretion and outflow has been impossible so far . for action of a propeller",
    "it is principally needed the excess magnetic field rotation velocity at the boundary of the magnetosphere ( the magnetosphere size or alven radius @xmath187 ) over the velocity of keplerian rotation of matter at this radius , or , in other words , @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the radius of corotation .",
    "of vital importance is the knowledge of the velocity of gas ejection .",
    "this is what the propeller efficiency depends on , i.  e. the momentum loss rate , the speed of evolution of stars etc . as a rule ,",
    "two cases are considered : 1 ) a hard propeller , when a gas is ejected by the magnetic field at a velocity of its rotation ( @xmath190 , where p is the star rotation period ) ( shakura , 1975 ; holloway et al . , 1978 ; wang , 1979 ) and",
    "2 ) a soft propeller , when the magnetic field heats a gas and it outflows at a parabolic velocity ( @xmath191 ) ( illarionov and sunyaev , 1975 ; davies et al . , 1979 ; davies and pringle , 1981 ) .",
    "the magnetic dipole is believed to approach a sphere through a dynamic pressing of accreted gas , therefore the soft propeller scenario is considered as more preferable .",
    "however , wang and robertson ( 1985 ) have performed numerical simulations of the propeller and shown that because of the kelvin - helmholtz instability plasmoids may penetrate into a star magnetic field , i.  e. be carried along by it and be ejected at a velocity close to the solid  body rotation velocity .",
    "thus the inclusion of possible instabilities in the propeller schema allows us to expect that the hard version may also be realized .",
    "we suppose that the white dwarf s magnetosphere in the system mwc560 undergoes transitions of the type  hard - soft  propeller . it is natural to relate the active state",
    "( the high , several thousand km / s and variable velocity of gas ejection ) to the hard version , while the passive ( the outflow velocity is several hundred km / s ) to the soft propeller version .",
    "for the  hard - soft  propeller transitions no dramatic reconstruction of the magnetosphere is required as is the case with the accretor - propeller transitions ( where even the hysteresis effects are expected ( lipunov , 1987 ) ) .",
    "it is possible that with variations of the rate of gas accretion onto the magnetosphere or with changing the condition of accretion ( disk or spherical ) , instabilities in the layer where magnetic field and gas interact , are suppressed , which caused a change in the mode of gas ejection .",
    "the size of the magnetosphere is determined by equality of the magnetic pressure @xmath192 and the dynamic pressure of gas @xmath193 , where v is a free - fall velocity , and @xmath194 .",
    "the dipole magnetic moment of the star is @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the magnetic field strength at the pole .",
    "assuming that @xmath197/y is accreted onto the white dwarf s magnetosphere , derive the magnetosphere size : @xmath198 the corotation radius is determined by the rotation period p of the white dwarf : @xmath199 from the propeller condition @xmath188 we can find the relationship @xmath200  g. the magnetosphere size is @xmath201  cm , i.  e. the magnetosphere is completely hidden from the observer beneath the photosphere of the outflowing wind ( @xmath202  cm ) . for the propeller mode to be realized in mwc560 , the white dwarf must be strongly magnetized .",
    "the rotation period @xmath203  s corresponds to the typical time of the observed brightness variability ( 1020  min ) .",
    "the rotating magnetic field is hidden well under the wind s photosphere , and direct radiation does not reach the observer ( it undergoes multiple scattering and is thermalized ) .",
    "nevertheless , ejection of gas in the active state of the object may disturb the wind and carry the radiation outward .",
    "so the object may be variable with a characteristic time of the order of the rotating period of the white dwarf .",
    "let us estimate the magnetosphere size in other ways .",
    "the lowest observed velocity of gas outflow in the passive state ( table  1 ) is about 600  km / s . assuming that in this state the propeller is in the soft mode , that is , the gas outflow velocity @xmath191 , find that @xmath204  cm .",
    "the inequality here indicates that , depending on the mass of the gaseous envelope lying on the magnetosphere , the outflow may proceed at a velocity lower than the parabolic one .",

    "the strong magnetic field of the white dwarf in mwc560 is likely to be the necessary condition of the gas ejection due to the propeller mechanism .",

    "after completion of the giant stage and formation of the second degenerate star , from the observational viewpoint this magnetic white dwarf will not at all differ ( after the young white dwarf gets cooler ) from a single star .    in the model discussed , the gas outflow in mwc560 will proceed until the giant phase is completed or the white dwarf slows down its rotation .",

    "several thousand years after deceleration of rotation of the white dwarf , accretion onto the surface will be permitted , i.  e. the star will pass to the accretor stage , at which secondary acceleration of rotation is possible .",
    "the final state of the white dwarf rotation in the evolution scenario depends on the state of the giant star .",
    "we can say that in any case from mwc560 a wide pair is formed , which consists of two white dwarfs .",
    "one of them ( magnetic ) will rotate with a period from 1020 minutes to a several hours .",
    "the propeller model in mwc560 allows both the nature of the hot component of the system and its sporadic variability ( flickering ) , and the origin of the jets to be explained . from observations of mwc560",
    "we know that jet  like outflow of matter occurs in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk ( in any case it is along the angular momentum of the accreting matter ) .",
    "the opening of the jets is sufficiently large , 2@xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "so a more suitable a term for the mwc560 jets would be the anisotropic wind or the sectorial structure of matter outflow described by shakura ( 1975 ) .",
    "one of the promising models appropriate for the propeller is the collimation of jets with the aid of magnetic field ( see references in ( livio , 1996 ) ) .",
    "blanford and payne ( 1982 ) have considered the picture of acceleration and collimation of gas by magnetic field above the accretion disk .",
    "this picture may be suited to the case of collimation of gas ejected by the propeller .",
    "gas is entrapped by the magnetosphere magnetic field , in so doing the field is distorted , the open magnetic lines form a toroidal field component . above the magnetosphere",
    "the toroidal field gets predominant and may accelerate and collimate gas along the axis of rotation .",
    "it does not seem possible to give a more specific description of the picture of acceleration and collimation of gas in mwc560 .",
    "the bulk of observational evidence permits one to hope that the object will stimulate the further development of the propeller model .",
    "spectroscopy results obtained at the 6-m telescope for the unusual symbiotic star mwc560 in the period from the autumn of 1990 to the spring of 1993 are presented .",
    "the high - velocity absorption lines of hi , d@xmath36d@xmath37  nai , feii(42 ) and hei , which radial velocity varies with a time ",
    "scale of several months and is equal to @xmath217  km / s are permanently present in the spectrum .",
    "the shape of the high  velocity absorption profiles in the spectrum of mwc560 suggests that these are formed in a jet directed towards the observer .",
    "these absorption lines are variable at times shorter than one day with an amplitude of about 10  %",
    ". a fast variability for a time of @xmath2 hours has been detected .",
    "evidence has been found for the existence of an opposite jet directed away from the observer : in the red wing of the @xmath3  line there is extra and variable radiation , whose radial velocity corresponds to the velocity of matter ejection in the jets measured from the absorption lines .    from the constancy of emission line radial velocities the inclination angle",
    "i@xmath218 has been estimated .",
    "the continuous spectrum has been modeled from the uv to ir range in two different , active and passive , states of the object .",
    "the observed spectrum is formed by a star of spectral class m45iii , a hot source and an absorbing screen ( the jet ) .",
    "the most likely spectral class of the giant star is m4 .",
    "the interstellar extinction to mwc560 is @xmath105  @xmath130 , the extinction to the giant star may be by 02 greater",
    ". parameters of the mwc560 jets and physical conditions of gas in them have been estimated .",
    "the opening of the jet is @xmath219 , its length at the place where the absorbent is located is @xmath220  cm . the temperature and the density of gas in the jet",
    "are @xmath9  k and n  @xmath221  @xmath112 .",
    "the density on the line of sight is varied , @xmath222  @xmath23 . in different activity states of the object only the velocity of gas ejection ( and accordingly the value of @xmath88 ) changes at an approximately constant mass loss rate in the jet ,",
    "the luminosity of the object @xmath13  erg / s is basically determined by the uv source with the temperature t  @xmath132  k , whose radius is @xmath15  cm .",
    "the hot source is , apparently , the photosphere of strong wind ( @xmath224 ) outflowing from the region around the white dwarf at a velocity of 100    200  km / s .",
    "we suppose that the wind and the jets are accelerated in the magnetic field of the white dwarf which accretes gas from the wind of the giant under the propeller regime .",
    "the gas is supplied through the accretion disk and ejected by the rotating magnetic field .",
    "a sectorial structure of the gas outflow ( the jet ) is formed .",
    "the different activity states of the object may correspond to different modes : a hard propeller with a gas ejection velocity of several thousand km / s and soft propeller with an ejection velocity of hundreds of km / s .",
    "the total rate of gas accretion onto the propeller is @xmath225 .",
    "the main part of it ( about 5070  % ) outflows as a slow wind .",
    "not more than 15  % of gas accreted onto the magnetosphere may reach the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "this share depends on which proportion of the object s luminosity ( may be the whole luminosity ) can be provided by the propeller . about 2030  % of the initial captured mass",
    "is ejected as jets .    for the effective operation of the propeller ,",
    "the white dwarf in mwc560 must be strongly magnetized .",
    "the strength of its surface magnetic field may be @xmath209  g , the period of its rotation may lie within the interval from 1020 minutes to 3 hours",
    ". the lower limit of the period is close to the scale of photometric flickering of the object , therefore the period of its rotation is likely to be about 1020 minutes",
    ". the magnetic field strength on the magnetosphere may amount to @xmath226  g. the magnetosphere is completely hidden from the observer under the photosphere of the slow outflowing wind .",
    "direct observations of radiation from the magnetosphere or from the surface layers are impossible since it is scattered much once before it appeares on the photosphere .",
    "it is possible that in active periods , when gas is ejected in portions at a velocity of several thousand km / s , channels may be formed in the gas envelope through which the observer can recognize bursts of hard or polarized radiation .",
    "further spectral and photometric observations of mwc560 are of great importance .",
