    "the investigation of polarization observables in electromagnetic and hadronic processes at high energies provides refinement of the information about strong interaction at short distances and the relevant reaction mechanisms .",
    "accordingly , the experimental study of processes with polarized particles becomes more and more important .",
    "experiments with deuteron targets or beams @xcite are particularly interesting , since the deuteron serves as a unique source of information on neutron properties at high transferred momenta ; the knowledge of which allows , e.g. to check a number of qcd predictions and sum rules . for example , for an investigation of the @xmath9 interaction in the deuteron at short distances , the three deuteron form factors ( magnetic , electric and quadrupole ) have to be determined . in the elastic @xmath10 scattering with unpolarized particles one can measure only two independent quantities , e.g. the magnetic form factor and the deuteron function @xmath11 , the latter being a kinematical combination of all three form factors .",
    "even these two quantities reveal an important information about the quark physics and dynamics at short distances as demonstrated , for instance , in recent measurements @xcite at tjnaf",
    ". however , for a full determination of the deuteron form factors separately , one needs measurements with polarized particles .",
    "for instance , measurements of the tensor analyzing power @xmath12 of recoil deuterons in elastic @xmath10 scattering allow for a determination of the charge form factor @xmath13 at high transferred momenta .",
    "namely the charge form factor is very sensitive to details of the @xmath9 interaction  @xcite and , besides information about short range correlations in the deuteron , the investigation of @xmath13 may essentially constrain the theoretical models applied in this area .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that the electromagnetic processes are considered as the cleanest ones , in such reactions one probes mainly the quark structure of the target , leaving almost untouched the physics connected with gluon degrees of freedom . in this context , hadron deuteron processes can be considered as complementary tool in investigating phenomena at short distances and also as a source of unique information unavailable in electromagnetic reactions , such as nucleon resonances , checking non - relativistic effective models , @xmath9 potentials etc .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations of the proton - deuteron processes at intermediate and high energies have started some decades ago by studying elastic @xmath14 scattering  @xcite , exclusive and inclusive break - up reactions @xcite with the goal of determining the the details of the deuteron wave function at short distances and the relevant reaction mechanisms .",
    "note , that in elastic backward @xmath14 processes it is possible to determine completely the reaction amplitude by measuring a full set of polarization observables ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , as in the electromagnetic processes one needs to measure different polarizations of the recoil deuteron .    since",
    "such polarization observables can be studied only by an additional secondary scattering of the reaction products , e.g. , inside a polarimeter , it is obvious that second process must possess a high enough cross section to assure a good efficiency of the polarimeter . traditionally , at low energies one uses the process @xmath15",
    "@xcite , while for relativistic energies the elastic @xmath16 scattering serves as polarimeter @xcite .",
    "bugg and wilkin @xcite proposed to use as an efficient deuteron polarimeter the process @xmath17 , where the final @xmath1 pair is detected with very low excitation energy ( see also ref .",
    "it has been argued that at low excitation energies and low transferred momenta the process @xmath17 is determined by the elementary @xmath18 charge - exchange of the incoming proton with the neutron in the deuteron , whereas the second proton acts merely as a spectator . in this case , the detected @xmath1 pair can be considered to be in the @xmath2 final state . within the non - relativistic spectator mechanism ,",
    "a significant value of the tensor analyzing power @xmath12 and a vanishing vector analyzing power were predicted  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cross section is rather large , so that the process @xmath17 can be considered as a good tool for determining the deuteron tensor characteristics .",
    "later detailed investigations  @xcite of this process confirmed the previous theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the charge - exchange processes of this type have also been proposed for investigations of other processes with deuterons , e.g. @xmath19 reactions @xcite , @xmath20 systems @xcite , @xmath21 systems , inelastic @xmath22 reactions off heavy nuclei to study isoscalar transitions @xmath23 @xcite etc .",
    "in addition , the reaction @xmath17 may be interesting in investigations of the elementary @xmath9 amplitude . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this reaction can be used as a part of a complete set of experiments to determine completely the amplitude of charge - exchange reaction @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "one may also investigate the influence of the nuclear medium on the @xmath9 amplitude  @xcite , or to study the double spin flip processes in quasi elastic scattering of deuterons from heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the direct consequence of these facts is that nowadays the interest in investigations of charge - exchange processes does not abate .",
    "for example , at the cooler synchrotron cosy in fz jlich a program to study of similar processes at relativistic energies has already started @xcite and a detailed investigation of polarization observables is envisaged . inspired by this , in previous work @xcite we investigated the process @xmath17 within the impulse approximation .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to consider the charge - exchange reaction at relativistic energies , as accessible at cosy and upgraded dubna accelerator by ( i ) taking into account the effects of final state interaction , ( ii ) to check whether in this case the non - relativistic predictions  @xcite hold and ( iii ) whether the reaction still can be regarded as a deuteron polarimeter tool and/or as complementary source of an experimental determination of the elementary charge - exchange partial amplitudes .",
    "we propose a covariant generalization of the spectator mechanism  @xcite based on the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) formalism and on a numerical solution of the bs equation with a realistic one - boson exchange kernel  @xcite .",
    "our amplitude of the process in an explicitly covariant form allows for a determination of any polarization observables .",
    "nevertheless , here we focus on calculations of the cross section and the tensor analyzing power @xmath12 for kinematical conditions as relevant for experiments at cosy .",
    "vector analyzing powers of the deuteron are strictly equal to zero in our case , since we consider the @xmath2 nn final state .",
    "the corresponding expressions are quite lengthy , so we do not present an explicit comparison with the non - relativistic formulae , nevertheless , the final results are written in a form as close as possible to the non - relativistic case .",
    "we are going to compare our results , computed at non - relativistic energies , with corresponding data and corresponding non - relativistic calculations @xcite thus demonstrating that our formulae hold in the non - relativistic limit as well , as it should be .",
    "we adopt for the process @xmath17 with a slowly moving , small - excitation energy @xmath1 pair the same mechanism as in @xcite , i.e. , the process is treated , in the deuteron center of mass , as a charge - exchange between the incoming proton and internal neutron with the second proton as a spectator .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 pair is supposed to be detected solely in the @xmath2 state .",
    "particular attention is paid to the pure impulse approximation , where the final state interaction in the @xmath1 pair is , for the time being , disregarded . within the impulse approximation",
    "we study systematically peculiarities of the reaction to find proper kinematical conditions where the supposed mechanism is adequate and to fix the choice of input parameters .",
    "then the final state interaction in the @xmath2 state is taken into account by solving the inhomogeneous bs equation in the one - iteration approximation , which allows one to numerically compute the corresponding partial amplitudes .",
    "the effects of final state interaction are found to be substantial and essentially improve the agreement with data . methodological prediction for the cosy kinematics",
    "will be presented as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in sect .",
    "ii kinematics and notation are introduced .",
    "a short review of the spin structure of the amplitude @xmath25 and definitions of polarization observables are presented .",
    "iii deals with the invariant amplitude within the bs formalism and defines the corresponding bs wave functions .",
    "a reduction of the covariant form of the amplitude to the traditional form in the two dimensional spinor space is also performed in this section . in the next section",
    "iv a detailed study of relativistic impulse approximation and a comparison with data is given . in sect .",
    "v the procedure of accounting for final state interaction in the continuum within the bs formalism is discussed .",
    "the total bs wave function for the @xmath2 configuration is presented , the corresponding numerical calculations of the cross section and tensor analyzing power and a comparison with the available experimental data is performed .",
    "conclusions and summary may be found in sect .",
    "some cumbersome expressions are relegated to the appendices .",
    "since in the exclusive processes with three nucleons in the final state we are interested in studying correlations in the @xmath1 pair we select those of them which , in the deuteron center of mass system , correspond to final states with one fast neutron and a slowly moving proton - proton pair , i.e. reactions of the type @xmath26 a peculiarity of the processes ( [ reaction ] ) is that the transferred momentum from the proton to the neutron is low , hence the main mechanism of the reaction can be described as a charge - exchange process of the incoming proton off the internal neutron , whereas the second proton in the deuteron remains merely as a spectator .",
    "as well known ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) the differential cross section of elementary charge - exchange process @xmath24 exhibits a sharp maximum at vanishing transferred momenta .",
    "therefore , if the reaction ( [ reaction ] ) is indeed governed by a charge - exchange subprocess , then the resulting @xmath1 pair will be detected with low total and relative momenta .",
    "reactions of this kind can fairly well be distinguished from other processes .",
    "for relatively low initial energies , such reactions are quite well experimentally investigated . in fig .",
    "[ pict1 ] , the diagram of such processes is schematically depicted .",
    "the following notations are adopted : @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the 4-momenta of the incoming proton and outgoing neutron , @xmath29 is the total 4-momentum of the @xmath1 pair , which is a sum of the corresponding 4-momenta of detected protons , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the invariant mass squared of the pair is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 stands for the nucleon mass and @xmath35 for the excitation energy of the pair .",
    "conform the supposed reaction mechanism , the excitation energy @xmath35 ranges to a few mev , say @xmath36 mev .",
    "at such low values of @xmath35 , the main contribution in the final state of the @xmath1 pair in the continuum comes from the @xmath2 configuration  @xcite . in what follows all corrections from higher partial waves",
    "are neglected , however , we realize that for higher values of @xmath35 an increasing role of these corrections is expected .",
    "further , the dirac spinors @xmath37 normalized as @xmath38 are introduced .",
    "then the differential cross section for the reaction ( [ reaction ] ) reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the flux factor , @xmath41 is the invariant amplitude and the statistical factor @xmath42 is due to two identical particles ( protons ) in the final state . by changing in eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) the kinematical variables from the momenta @xmath43 to the relative and total momenta of the pair and taking into account that there is no angular dependence in the @xmath2 configuration the cross section can be written as @xmath44 since our numerical solution of the bethe - salpeter equation has been obtained in the deuteron rest system all further calculations are performed in that . the quantization @xmath45 axis is chosen along the momentum @xmath46 of the incoming proton ; the @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes will be specified below . changing the variables in ( [ cross1 ] ) we arrive at @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 denotes the azimuthal angle of the final neutron . further we consider only the case where the initial proton and the final neutron are unpolarized and the polarization density matrix of the initial deuteron , @xmath54 , possesses an axial symmetry relative to the @xmath45-direction , i.e. @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the vector and tensor polarization parameters , respectively . in this case the angular dependence upon @xmath53 in eq .",

    "the amplitude @xmath69 is a vector in the coordinate space and a matrix in the spinor basis and consequently can be decomposed over the introduced basis vectors ( [ basis ] ) and pauli matrices @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) as @xmath72 in eq .",
