    "the issue of non - gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has touched the most fundamental base in cosmology .",
    "it was first brought to attention by ferreira , magueijo and grski that non - gaussian signal is present in the cobe data . although it is almost certain that the departure from gaussianity is induced by systematic error @xcite , the discussions and focus about non - gaussianity since then have been focusing primarily on primordial origin .",
    "mechanisms other than the simplest inflation model that have been proposed for primordial density fluctuations produce non - gaussian fields ( see bartolo et al . 2004 and references therein ) . due to this reason",
    ", the issue of non - gaussianity seems to be discussed separately from that of the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "it is in the framework of inflation paradigm that the cosmological parameters can only be determined correctly from the angular power spectrum if the cmb temperature anisotropies constitute a gaussian random field ( grf ) .",
    "therefore , the issue of non - gaussianity is not _ beyond _ the power spectrum , but still _ within _ the power spectrum .",
    "the statistical characterization of temperature fluctuations of cmb radiation on a sphere can be expressed as a sum over spherical harmonics : @xmath0 where @xmath1 . the strict definition of a homogeneous and isotropic grf , as a result of the inflation paradigm , requires that the moduli @xmath2 are rayleigh distributed and the phases @xmath3 are uniformly random on the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the central limit theorem , however , guarantees that a superposition of a large number of harmonic modes will be close to a gaussian as long as the phases are random .",
    "hence the random - phase hypothesis on its own serves as a definition of gaussianity @xcite .",
    "one of the most useful properties of grf is that the second - order statistics , the 2-point correlation function or the angular power spectrum @xmath5 @xmath6 furnish a complete description of the grf .",
    "it is based on this analytically - simple but important property that the cosmological parameters can be correctly determined from @xmath5 . accordingly ,",
    "if non - gaussian signals are present , either with primordial origin , or induced from data processing or systematic error , the cosmological parameters derived from the @xmath5 of such a `` contaminated '' field will have larger error bars .",
    "the issue of non - gaussianity in cmb is therefore not only related to discriminating the theories of origin of primordial fluctuations , it is also fundamental , in the framework of inflation paradigm , for the determination of the cosmological parameters .    to test non - gaussianity , the next order statistics : the 3-point correlation function , or its fourier transform , the bispectrum are often used .",
    "the higher - order statistics , however , are only part of the whole picture about non - gaussianity .",
    "it takes a full hierarchy of @xmath7-point correlation functions , or the polyspectra , to complete the statistical characterisation of the cmb anisotropies .    since the release of 1-year data , great efforts have been made for the search and detection of non - gaussianity via various approaches and methods @xcite .",
    "these detection of non - gaussianity shall augment the error bars on the estimation in cosmological parameters .    practically speaking , characterizing non - gaussianity through phases",
    "is one of the most general approaches .",
    "based on the random - phase hypothesis , the key to developing statistical methods using phases is testing their `` randomness '' . due to the @xmath8 wrapping , however , the phases tend to be uniformly distributed at @xmath9 $ ] . for example , for a point source produces phases are distributed evenly and orderly , but not randomly between 0 and @xmath8 .",
    "probing non - gaussianity via examining uniformity of phases themselves between 0 and @xmath8 is often as ineffective as via examining one - point gaussian ( temperature ) probability distribution @xmath10 ( e.g. it is possible @xmath10 is still gaussian for a non - gaussian field ) .",
    "the @xmath8 wrapping causing a uniform distribution of phases is similar to the central limit theorem in action producing one - point gaussian probability distribution .",
    "we thus seek _ associations _ between phases as a more sensitive and effective statistical measure .",
    "the linear association such as auto correlation @xmath11 , however , does not give useful statistics due to the circular nature of phases .",
    "to counter this problem , return mapping of phases is introduced to associate phase pairs systematically @xcite .",
    "the main idea is mapping all phase pairs with the same separation @xmath12 onto a square , which is conceptually similar to the auto correlation @xmath13 .",
    "another important feature of phases is that phases are closely related to morphology . through pixel - by - pixel cross correlation ,",
    "maps with the same phases display strong resemblance in morphology , regardless of their power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the level of cross - correlation of phases taken from two images therefore renders significance of resemblance between them .",
    "based on the simple but prevailing assumption that the cmb signals should not correlate with the foregrounds ( i.e. the microwave foregrounds should not have knowledge in what the cmb signals ` look like ' ) , cross correlations of phases between the derived cmb and the foregrounds shed light on the status of microwave foreground cleaning .",
    "dineen and coles perform cross correlations in pixel domain between the derived cmb and the foreground maps .",
    "naselsky , doroshkevich & verkhodanov , naselsky et al .",
    "use cross correlation of phases to illustrate the foreground contaminations in the derived cmb signals .",
    "return mapping of phases renders phase associations on a square with each side ranged @xmath9 $ ] ( with periodic boundaries ) .",
    "cross correlation of phases between derived cmb and foregrounds connect phases from the same @xmath14 mode of the maps also produce mapping in a @xmath9 $ ] square .",
    "the null hypotheses for both cases : random phases for a gaussian cmb sky and no cross correlation between the cmb and the foregrounds shall result in random points on @xmath9 $ ] squares .",
    "statistics that are developed for a square taking into account of the periodic boundaries can be implemented both on the return mapping ( auto correlation of phases ) of the derived cmb signal and on cross correlation of phases between cmb and foregrounds .",
    "more importantly , through checking both auto and cross correlations of phases from the derived maps , one can gain insight into the issue of non - gaussianity .",
    "in this paper we test on each spherical harmonic multipole @xmath15 the auto and cross correlations , as well as the overall correlations .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we recap the phase mapping technique and introduce the kuiper s statistics .",
    "we apply the kuiper s statistics in section 3 both on the auto and cross correlation of phases of the 1-year derived maps and connect the phase correlations with non - trivial whitened @xmath16 distribution in 1d fourier composition .",
    "the conclusion and discussions are in section 4 .",
    "chiang , coles & naselsky have introduced a technique called return mapping of phases to render associations between phase pairs on a square .",
    "the idea is borrowed from the return map in chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the phase pairs are taken systematically and mapped onto a @xmath9 $ ] square . in a return map of phase pairs with the separation @xmath17 ,",
    "for example , the mapped points formed from phase pairs have the coordinates @xmath18 for all possible @xmath15 and @xmath19 . because of the circular nature of phases , the @xmath9 $ ] return map is periodic at all 4 sides , which can be viewed as a flat torus .    after the mapping of phases , various statistics can be applied to extract the statistical significance .",
    "chiang , naselsky & coles use a simple mean chi - square statistic to extract the information of the _ one - dimensional _ uniformity of the distribution of the return maps . in order to probe associations between points ( uniformity in 2 dimensions )",
    ", care has to be taken on the periodicity of the return maps . in fig.[mosaicprojection ] on the left we show the mosaic of 4 return maps to indicate the periodicity . to probe the connectivity of points on the return maps , we consider the following 2 directions : anti - diagonal ( @xmath20 ) , and diagonal ( @xmath21 ) onto the @xmath22 axis .",
    "this projection is also useful for cross correlation of phases .",
    "complete cross correlation of phases produces points exactly on the anti - diagonal line .",
    "the projection of a point located at @xmath23 along the anti - diagonal direction to @xmath22 axis as shown in fig.[mosaicprojection ] is equivalent to taking the difference of its @xmath24 and @xmath22 coordinates , i.e. @xmath25 ; in the diagonal direction @xmath26 . in a return map of phases with separation @xmath17 ,",
    "points are formed with phase pairs @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the projection then becomes @xmath29 : the phase difference . in coles et al .",
    "they probe phase correlations by investigating the uniformity of the neighbouring phase difference @xmath30 .",
    "this is equivalent to testing the uniformity of the projected points on a return map of the separation @xmath31 . following this line of thought ,",
    "the analysis of the projection in either the vertical or the horizontal directions is that of the randomness of @xmath27 themselves .",
    "the kuiper s statistic can be viewed as a variant of kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test @xcite . as the projection of points on the directions we mention in  [ proj ] produces unbinned distribution that is a function of single independent variable , it is very useful to apply the k - s test to probe its uniformity .",
    "the k - s statistic is taken as the maximum distance of the cumulative proability distribution against the theoretical one : @xmath32 for circular function , however , one needs to take into account of the maximum distance both above and below the @xmath33 @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\max_{-\\infty <    x < \\infty } [ p(x)-s_n(x ) ] \\label{maxd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the c.l . against the null hypothesis ( e.g. uniformity of phases in our case ) can be calculated from @xcite @xmath35 \\right ) , \\label{significance}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the data points .",
    "we run monte carlo ( mc ) simulation in order to test eq.([significance ] ) and ( [ analytical ] ) .",
    "one hundred thousand realizations of the difference of two random phase series ( the phases are defined @xmath38 ) are simulated , which is to mimic the projection of return map shown in fig.[mosaicprojection ] . for each @xmath37",
    ", we have an ensemble of 100 000 random realization each producing maximum distance @xmath39 as in eq.([maxd ] ) .",
    "we then sort these 100 000 @xmath39 to yield the statistical significance from mc simulation .",
    "simultaneously , the statistical significance can be calculated directly from eq.([significance ] ) and ( [ analytical ] ) . in fig.[error ] we show the difference in the statistical significance of the kuiper statistics from its analytical derivation , eq.([significance ] ) and ( [ analytical ] ) , and mc simulation .",
    "we list the 3 frequently quoted significance value ( from top to bottom ) : 66.269% , 95.450% and 99.730% , which corresponds to gaussian 1 , 2 , 3-@xmath40 c.l .",
    ", respectively .",
    "one can see that for 95.450% and 99.730% the difference between analytical calculation and mc simulation is down to @xmath41 level even for as few data points as @xmath42 .",
    "we use the maps available on the www for testing this method : the derived foreground maps at 5 frequency bands from the website and the 4 derived cmb maps : the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map by the science team @xcite , the ilc map by eriksen ( hereafter eilc),hke / cmbdata/ ] the wiener - filtered map ( wfm)max / wmap.html ] by tegmark , de oliveira - costa & hamilton , and the phase - cleaned map ( pcm ) by naselskychiang / wmap.html ] . note that these maps are used only for testing the effectiveness of the kuiper s statistics because of their different approaches on foreground cleaning and their different morphology .",
    "our claim about non - gaussianity in this paper shall not contradict with others in the literature as most of these maps , as advised by the authors , are not for scientific purposes .    in fig.[xcorr",
    "] as an example of how the kuiper s statistics works , we show the cross correlation of phases between the ilc and the w - band foreground map at @xmath43 ( top ) and @xmath44 ( bottom ) and their corresponding cumulative probability functions from the projection in the anti - diagonal direction onto the @xmath22 axis .",
    "we show with thin ( @xmath45 ) and thick ( @xmath46 ) shaded lines the maximum distances of the cumulative probability distribution above and below the theoretical one , respectively .",
    "we consider first within each multipole number @xmath15 the mapping of phases of fixed @xmath47 .",
    "in fig.[ksmapping ] we show the kuiper s statistics on return maps for the ilc map , the eilc map , the wfm and the pcm . within each multipole @xmath15 we take the phases of fixed separation @xmath47 and map them into a return map . for the multipole number",
    "@xmath48 we take the separation from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , although in general we can take any @xmath47 values to test the randomness of phases . in order to display the c.l .",
    "more clearly against random phase hypothesis , we show the @xmath51 instead .",
    "so @xmath41 corresponds to c.l .",
    "99.9% against uniformity of phases , @xmath52 corresponds to c.l .",
    "99%  etc ..",
    "one interesting result is that for @xmath53 the mapping of @xmath54 for all 4 maps are all above 75% c.l .. and the multipole numbers which has @xmath47 mappings that are above 95.45% c.l . against random phase hypothesis",
    "are @xmath53 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 30 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , 41 , 43 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . for @xmath59 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath62 , both mappings reach above 99.73% . for other 3 maps , they all have modes that reach 95.45% . we do not , however , claim the overall non - gaussianity of these maps .",
    "we also consider the mapping for separation @xmath17 from all the available phases from @xmath63 to 50 ( except those of @xmath64 modes ) . in fig.[mappingall ] we show the kuiper s statistics for the 4 maps : the ilc , eilc , wfm and pcm .",
    "the separation of return mapping ranges from 0 to 5 for both @xmath65 ( @xmath24 axis ) , @xmath47 @xmath22 axis ) , although it can be extended to higher number .",
    "the ilc , eilc and pcm have @xmath66 correlation above 68.27% c.l .",
    "and there are considerable degrees of phase correlation at separation @xmath67 for ilc , eilc and pcm , but except for wfm .",
    "note also the strong correlation of @xmath68 for the pcm .",
    "this specific correlation is recently mentioned in naselsky & novikov , which is caused by the symmetric ( w.r.t .",
    "galactic centre ) point - like peaks lying along the galactic plane .",
    "the pcm is produced without further cleaning performed for ilc , eilc and wfm , hence the galactic contamination is still present .    in order to see how non - random phases affect the distribution ,",
    "we assemble only the phase part in each harmonic number @xmath15 in fourier composition ( the so - called `` whitened '' image ) : @xmath69    in fig.[alm2k ] we display for @xmath63 to 17 the `` whitened '' distributions which have no influence from the amplitudes @xmath70 . this representation in 1d",
    "fourier composition for each @xmath15 , rather than in the standard whole - sky spherical harmonic composition , can provide some advantages for further analysis .",
    "the morphology can be seen more clearly in 1d fourier composition than in spherical harmonic composition . here",
    "we can relate phase correlation ( in fourier space ) to the simple grf peak statistics ( in real space ) .",
    "the extrema ( maximum or minimum ) that have reached @xmath71 appear in the distribution of @xmath53 , 12 , 15 and 17 : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "these multipole numbers correspond to those picked up by the kuiper s statistics with non - random phases at 95.45% c.l .. furthermore , phase correlation does not only manifest itself in the extrema .",
    "one can see , for example , for @xmath76 the assembled whitened @xmath16 has repeated peaks . the c.l . against random phase hypothesis at @xmath77 of @xmath76",
    "reaches 94.13% .",
    "the kuiper s statistics can also be applied to cross correlation .    in fig.[cl ]",
    "we show the c.l . against the null hypothesis in cross - correlation of phases for @xmath63 to 50 .",
    "the thick lines are the ilc cross the foreground maps at ( from top to bottom ) k , ka , q , v and w - band , the cross sign ( @xmath78 ) , the diamond sign ( @xmath79 ) , the plus sign ( @xmath80 ) are the eilc by eriksen , the pcm by naselsky and the wfm by tegmark , respectively , cross the foreground maps .",
    "we would like to point out that the ilc are produced by less weights from the w - band map than v and q. one can see that the ilc map has substantial cross correlation of phases for @xmath43 and 8 with all 5 channel foreground maps .",
    "high cross correlation with the foregrounds , however , does not necessarily imply the non - gaussianity for that multipole number .    in fig.[assemble8 ]",
    "we show the assembled @xmath16 distribution for @xmath44 from ilc map and w - channel foreground map . from the kuiper s statistics for cross correlation of phases , for @xmath44 the correlation reaches c.l .",
    "89.98% , which reflects on their resemblance in morphology .",
    "in this paper we introduce the kuiper s statistic to probe the 2d uniformity for the phase mapping technique .",
    "the kuiper s statistics are useful to explore both auto correlation and cross correlation of phases .",
    "we use the 4 maps to test the effectiveness of this method : ilc , the ilc by eriksen , the wfm by tegmark and the pcm by naselsky and found several multipole numbers with non - randomness of phases over 95.45% .",
    "the kuiper s statistics can also used to test on all the available phases .",
    "contrary to the @xmath16 representation for each @xmath15 from standard spherical harmonic composition , we use 1d fourier composition to display the @xmath16 .",
    "we use the `` whitened '' fourier composition to display the connection between non - random phases and non - trivial morphology , and between cross - correlated phases of 2 maps and resemblance in their morphology .",
    "the peculiarity of @xmath43 and 8 found by copi can be seen clearly in the cross correlation with the foregrounds at all 5 foreground maps , as shown in fig.[cl ] , particularly with the w band foreground map .",
    "this is another advantage of using phases as cross checking for non - gaussianity for the cmb signal .",
    "there is no other method so far that can cross check both the foreground maps and the derived cmb map when peculiarities are found .",
    "what is unclear though , is the non - random phases at @xmath53 appearing on all ilc , eilc wfm , and pcm ( fig.[ksmapping ] ) , where the cross correlation with foregrounds is reasonably low .",
    "we are grateful for the useful discussions with peter coles and mike hobson .",
    "we acknowledge the use of the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",
    "support for lambda is provided by the nasa office of space science .",
