    "random walks have long been one of the most fundamental processes both in physics and mathematics@xcite . due to their simplicity and interesting and rich structure ,",
    "they provide the basis for understanding many kinds of physical phenomena , including transport processes , fluctuating time series , relaxation processes , and pattern formation .",
    "it is well known that for a random walk on a symmetric and homogeneous background , the average displacement vanishes and the average mean - square displacement scales linearly with time : @xmath6    on the other hand , it is also known that the diffusional behavior of the system is strongly and qualitatively modified by disorder , especially when the spatial dimension is low . in a one - dimensional random walk with random disorder , the diffusion is strongly suppressed and the average mean - square displacement grows on a log - time scale @xcite : @xmath7 which is called ultraslow diffusion .    in this article we consider systems with aperiodic disorder .",
    "an aperiodic disorder is generated by a certain deterministic rule .",
    "it is this point that distinguishes aperiodic from random disorder .",
    "we expect that the behavior of systems with aperiodic disorder is , in general , intermediate between that of homogeneous system and that of system with random disorder .",
    "in fact , for a random walk on a certain particular one - dimensional lattice with aperiodic disorder , it was reported in ref.@xcite that an anomalous diffusion may occur .",
    "this is characterized as @xmath8 interestingly these normal , ultraslow , and anomalous diffusion are observed in dynamical deterministic maps@xcite .",
    "recently an unified understanding of the diffusional behavior described by eqs.([normaldif])-([anomdif ] ) has been attempted from the point of view of a weakly chaotic regime of a deterministic map@xcite .",
    "in addition to the theoretical and mathematical interest , systems with aperiodic disorder have been fabricated artificially@xcite .",
    "we investigate the structure of the stationary probability distribution of a random walk on a one - dimensional lattice with aperiodic disorder . for a one - dimensional lattice",
    ", aperiodic disorder is expressed by a corresponding aperiodic sequence .",
    "it is the wandering exponent @xmath0 that characterizes an aperiodic disorder and affects the diffusional behavior .",
    "it determines how the geometrical fluctuation of the sequence @xmath9 scales with the length of the sequence @xmath10 , @xmath11@xcite : if @xmath0 is negative , the geometrical fluctuation is bounded and the effect of the disorder becomes smaller as the size of the system grows .",
    "therefore , the diffusional behavior becomes qualitatively similar to that on a homogeneous background . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is positive , the effect of the disorder becomes stronger with an increase in the system size .",
    "if @xmath0 vanishes , the effect of the disorder is almost independent of the system size - the fluctuation grows logarithmically . in this case",
    "we observe anomalous diffusion , which is written as eq.([anomdif ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the stationary probability distribution will show a characteristic pattern . furthermore , we expect the pattern to depend on only the wandering exponent and to correspond to the diffusional behavior .",
    "we do not expect it to depend on the details of the aperiodic sequence .    here",
    "we consider random walks on one - dimensional lattices , for which the disorder is constructed by the thue - morse ( tm ) , the rudin - shapiro ( rs ) , and the paperfolding ( pf ) sequences , which are taken as representative examples .",

    "i.e. _ , they are composed of two types of symbols , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; 2 ) they are constructed systematically from the initial sequences and by the substitution rules ; 3 ) the ratio of the number of @xmath12 to that of @xmath13 converges to unity in the limit of infinite length . in these cases",
    "the geometrical fluctuation of the sequence is given by the difference between the number of @xmath12 and that of @xmath13 .",
    "multifractal analysis will be used to characterize the structure of the stationary probability distribution .",

    "let @xmath15 be the measure assigned to the @xmath16-th patch .",
    "it is expected that the measure scales with @xmath14 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the singularity exponent .",
    "it is also expected that the number of patches which takes the value of the singularity exponent between @xmath19 and @xmath20 also scales as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is , roughly speaking , the fractal dimension of the set of patches with @xmath19 .",
    "multifractal analysis has been applied to characterize the scaling structure of various distributions including those of the quantum localization problem@xcite , energy dissipation in turbulence@xcite , and the sidebranch structure of dendrites@xcite .",
    "since it is so widely applicable , we expect that multifractal analysis will also be a good tool for our investigation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present our model .",

    "multifractal analysis is performed .",
    "we describe the finite - size scaling formulation and discuss the criterion for classifying the localization property of the distribution and the finite - size effect .",
