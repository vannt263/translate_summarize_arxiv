    "substantial improvements in observational capabilities over the past two decades have allowed to measure the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in nearby galaxies using a few different methods across a range of wavelengths , revealing that smbhs are ubiquitous and most likely present in every stellar spheroid ( see , e.g. , for a review ) .",
    "black holes are now recognized to play a fundamental but as yet not fully understood role in the growth and evolution of galaxies .",
    "as the angular resolution of observations increases , so does the number of reliable smbh mass measurements , and several correlations have now emerged between smbh mass and host galaxy properties such as bulge mass , total luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "this last so - called @xmath12 relation is the tightest , but all empirical correlations suggest that galaxy evolution and smbh growth are closely connected .",
    "numerical simulations reproduce these correlations and provide suggestive evidence that this co - evolution likely involves self - regulation mechanisms ( e.g.  agn feedback ; ) .",
    "another fact supporting the co - evolution paradigm is that as the number of dynamically - measured smbh masses increases , different relationships for different types of galaxies are starting to emerge .",
    "for example , @xcite found that different relations best fit samples of early- and late - type galaxies , the smbh mass being typically two times larger at a given velocity dispersion for early - type galaxies .",
    "the current empirical correlations are however based on only @xmath13 objects , not enough to reliably divide objects and contrast the relations of different galaxy samples .",
    "this shortcoming is compounded by the fact that almost @xmath14 of these objects are early - type galaxies , a problem arising from the very limited number of methods available to measure smbh masses , and the fact that each method is biased toward objects with certain characteristics .",
    "we discuss this problem below , and the need for more measuring techniques applicable across a broader range of galaxy types .",
    "dynamical smbh mass measurements have so far relied on only a handful of methods .",
    "stellar dynamical measurements have the obvious advantage that every galaxy has a substantial population of stars moving exclusively under the influence of gravity , and stars are easily probed at optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "the modelling methods are well established and applicable to many galaxies ; @xmath15 of current smbh mass measurements rely on stellar dynamics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical modelling tools are relatively complex and often restricted to axisymmetric objects , dust can easily perturb measurements , and relatively high spectral resolution is required to probe the higher order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distributions . these constraints result in samples heavily biased toward early - type galaxies .",
    "ionised gas dynamics is also used to measure smbh masses , and is typically probed through nebular emission lines at optical / nir wavelengths , that are present in most galaxies .",
    "challenges for this method however include non - gravitational forces ( e.g.  shocks ) and significant turbulent motions superimposed on ( quasi-)circular motion .",
    "observations with multiple slits are often unable to fully characterise the kinematics and overcome these challenges , but significant improvements have been made with integral - field spectroscopic ( ifs ) observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamics of accretion discs containing megamasers offers another way forward to measure smbh masses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the precision is nearly on par with that in our own milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , occasionally allowing to positively rule in smbhs ( as opposed to other potential compact dark objects ) , but the rarity of appropriate megamaser systems ( @xmath16 of objects searched ; see ) makes this at best a niche method .",
    "another limitation of this method is that megamasers have only been detected in seyfert 2 and low - ionisation nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) galaxies so far , containing smbhs of relatively low masses .",
    "the reason for this bias is unknown , but it again suggests a difficulty to build up large samples .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of molecular gas probed at mm / sub - mm wavelengths has emerged as a very promising method ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular because of the exquisite angular resolution and sensitivity afforded by the atamaca large millimeter / sub - millimeter array ( alma )",
    ". as for ionised gas , molecular gas can in principle be affected by non - gravitational forces and turbulence , although in practice ( giant ) molecular clouds tend to move ballistically over much of their orbits , and molecular gas observations are unaffected by dust .",
    "of course , some galaxies have no molecular gas detected ( as is the case for many early - type galaxies ; @xcite ) , and others none in their very centre @xcite , but this method has enormous potential . for instance",
    ", @xcite showed that the smbh mass of @xmath17 local galaxies could be measured with alma when it reaches full capability , and the sphere of influence ( soi ; @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the gravitational constant ) of the largest smbhs ( @xmath20  @xmath4 ) is spatially resolvable across the whole of cosmic time .",
    "needless to say , the molecular gas method also has the potential to redress the current bias against late - type galaxies in @xmath12 studies ( now only @xmath21 of the sample ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite derived the smbh mass without directly detecting the keplerian motion at the galaxy centre .",
    "this was due to the particular molecular gas disc morphology ( in the case of @xcite ) and severe beam smearing ( in the case of @xcite ) .",
    "the smbh masses were constrained to good accuracy ( e.g. 20% error for @xcite ) , although higher - angular resolution would have allowed to further constrain the measured values .",
    "@xcite detected the keplerian upturn at the centre of the nearby galaxy ngc  1332 , but the smbh mass was not very well constrained due to the soi resolved along the disc s major axis but unresolved along its minor axis .",
    "higher - angular resolution observation in @xcite constrained the smbh mass to @xmath22 accuracy .",
    "building on small pilot projects @xcite , we have recently started the mm - wave interferometric survey of dark object masses ( wisdom ) project .",
    "this project aims to benchmark and test the molecular gas dynamics method , develop tools and best practice , and exploit the growing power of alma to better populate and thus constrain smbh ",
    "galaxy scaling relations .",

    ".ngc  3665 properties . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the gravitational potential of the galaxy is calculated from the summation of the mge model components multiplied by a constant @xmath9 and the smbh modelled as a point like mass , by following the equation in @xcite .",
    "the circular velocity curve in the equatorial plane is then calculated from this by using the ; mge_circular_velocity procedure within the jeans axisymmetric modelling ( jam ) package ( @xcite ) .",
    "our assumption of a spatially constant @xmath9 should be treated with caution given that the molecular gas disc ( and potentially associated star formation ) extends to the nucleus of ngc  3665 @xcite .",
    "the effect of any uniform star formation or young stellar population in the region of interest is implicitly subsumed into our adopted @xmath9 , but a steep gradient could be problematic .",
    "however , neglecting centrally - concentrated star formation , and thus a decreasing @xmath9 with decreasing radius , effectively overestimates the stellar contribution to the total mass in the very centre .",
    "our smbh mass estimates are thus conservative .",
    "the effects of a potentially varying @xmath9 will be further explored in @xcite .      given the circular velocity curve obtained from the mge formalism described above ( section  [ subsec : model_lumdis ] ) , and the adopted molecular gas disc inclination ( which is the same as that used to de - project our mge models )",
    ", we generate a model data cube using the kinematic molecular simulation ( kinms ) code of @xcite .",
    "this assumes circular motions and a spatially uniform ( but free ) gas velocity dispersion .",
    "instrumental effects such as beam - smearing and spatial and velocity binning are all taken into account by kinms .",
    "for the properties of the molecular gas disc , we further assume that it has an exponential surface brightness profile with a void in the centre .",
    "the three free parameters describing the molecular gas distribution are thus its surface brightness scaling factor , radial scale radius and the radius of the central hole .",
    "the other free parameters required to fully describe a model ( or , rather , to allow its comparison to real data ) are the kinematic centre and position angle of the molecular gas disc in the plane of the sky and the galaxy systemic velocity .",

    "as ngc  3665 harbours an agn , the molecular gas could be affected by its presence and/or that of the smbh itself . with the highest angular resolution achieved so far , our co observations have revealed that the molecular gas disc in ngc  3665 has an unresolved central hole , the position of which coincides with that of the radio core ( detected with vlbi observations ; ) and the peak of the stellar surface brightness ( identified from _",
    "hst _ observations ) .",
    "the absence of molecular gas within a radius of @xmath111 or @xmath112  pc suggests that some mechanism may be dissociating the molecular gas or preventing it from forming or accumulating in the very centre of the galaxy .",
    "the dissociation of molecules generally has two main causes , agn activity and uv radiation from young stars .",
    "while the former is clearly a possibility , the latter is unlikely to be significant in ngc  3665 as the star formation density is low @xcite .",
    "dynamical effects can also affect the distribution and survival of molecular gas .",
    "shocks and resonances are obvious possibilities , but it may also be that the strong shear expected near the smbh ( where the circular velocity curve varies with the radius @xmath113 as @xmath114 ) can destroy molecular clouds , where most molecules are generally found .",
    "such dynamical mechanisms will be analysed further in future works .",
    "evidently , the lack of molecular gas in the central hole also suggests that there is no current cold gas accretion in that region .",
    "having said that , observations targeting different molecules and/or transitions are necessary to prove that the central hole is truly devoid of gas , and to explore possible mechanisms for void creation .",
    "as mentioned above , given ngc  3665 s stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , the best - fit smbh mass is in agreement with the latest @xmath42@xmath43 relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , we can also investigate whether this smbh mass is consistent with the known properties of the agn .",
    "a radio jet was detected early on in ngc  3665 , with the jet axis almost exactly perpendicular to the major axis of the central molecular gas disc . while agn jets are generally thought to emerge perpendicularly to their accretion discs ,",
    "it is also commonly accepted that there need not be a connection with the orientation of the large - scale disc of the galaxy . while the latter is the case for low - luminosity agn such as seyferts in late - type galaxies , the jet and large - scale molecular gas disc in ngc  3665 clearly have a connection .",
    "the kinematic position angle of the molecular gas disc is determined to be @xmath115 , roughly perpendicular to the position angle of the jet , @xmath116 ( determined by drawing a line from the northeast to the southwest blob seen at 5  ghz by @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ngc  3665 ( @xmath117 ) was estimated to be @xmath118  erg  s@xmath25 in the @xmath29@xmath119  kev energy range , extrapolated from the total energy within the _ chandra _ energy range of @xmath120@xmath121  kev by assuming a power - law spectrum @xmath122 and a value of @xmath123 derived from the same observations @xcite . comparing this x - ray luminosity to the eddington luminosity calculated from our best - fit smbh mass ( @xmath124  erg  s@xmath25  @xmath125  erg  s@xmath25 )",
    ", we obtain an eddington ratio of @xmath126 .",
    "this relatively low eddington ratio suggests radiatively inefficient flows , including powerful outflows such as the radio jet observed in ngc  3665 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the agn properties of ngc  3665 do not conflict with the derived smbh mass nor with the observed molecular gas kinematics .",
    "several high angular resolution observations of kinematics , aiming to measure smbh masses , show keplerian upturns in galaxy centres ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "keplerian motion is expected in a potential dominated by a smbh , where observations resolve the smbh soi and some emission arises from within the soi .",
    "spatially resolving the keplerian region naturally allows to constrain the smbh mass to high accuracy , as only a point mass yields such a behaviour , but our data do not show clear keplerian motion .",
    "a possible reason for this is that co emission is not present in the smbh s vicinity , as our model reveals a central cavity of radius @xmath52 ( see section  [ subsec : model_result ] ) .",
    "even if that were not the case , the synthesized beam ( @xmath127 ; see section  [ subsec : obsdr ] ) could have smeared out the information from within the soi ( @xmath51 ; see section  [ subsec : model_result ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we measure a smbh mass with an uncertainty of only @xmath53 ( at @xmath8 confidence ) .",
    "the stellar @xmath9 and inclination , that have a direct influence on the smbh mass , also have small uncertainties . here",
    "we therefore investigate possible systematic errors on these parameters , and then discuss other possible effects that could increase the error budget .",
    "a potential reason for the small error on the stellar @xmath9 is the rather large fitting area , set to @xmath34 so as to include all co emission .",
    "a large fraction of this area is dominated by the stars rather than the smbh .",
    "the uncertainty on the stellar @xmath9 ( and in turn the smbh mass and inclination ) may thus decrease as the number of constraints ( i.e. the area ) increases , irrespective of whether the fit is good or not , simply because the model looses its freedom to vary ( @xmath38 would otherwise increase unacceptably ) .",
    "we therefore narrow down the fitting area to @xmath128 , and repeat the fit described in section  [ sec : model ] .",

    "this best - fit parameter set yields @xmath132 .",
    "surprisingly , with fewer data , the constraints on the smbh mass ( @xmath133 error ) , @xmath9 ( @xmath134 error ) and inclination ( @xmath135 error , all at @xmath8 confidence ) are just as tight as the original result . comparing these results with the ones from the original fit ( @xmath3  @xmath4 , @xmath6  @xmath7 and @xmath136 , all at @xmath8 ; see section  [ subsec : model_result ] )",
    ", we nevertheless notice a possible systematic error on the stellar @xmath9 , but not on the smbh mass or inclination .",
    "the systematic error on the stellar @xmath9 could come from the mge model ( stellar luminosity profile ) , that has no associated errors .",
    "the stellar luminosity profile becomes degenerate with the stellar @xmath9 when calculating the circular velocity , and thus clearly affects the uncertainty on the stellar @xmath9 .",
    "our mge model also fluctuates depending on , for example , how we define the region of dust attenuation ( see section  [ subsec : model_lumdis ] and figure  [ fig : mge ] for the mge model fitting ) .",
    "we thus use two more mge models with different definitions of the region affected by dust , and fit to an area of @xmath34 .",

    "the resulting smbh mass is @xmath138  @xmath4 with @xmath139  @xmath7 , yielding @xmath140 .",
    "second , we mask all the pixels with negative values in an unsharp - masked version of the _ _ h__st image , created using a gaussian of fwhm @xmath141 . the mask and the unsharp - masked image are shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : mgealt ] . by using the mge fit created from the unmasked pixels ,",
    "the smbh mass and stellar @xmath9 are measured to be @xmath142  @xmath4 and @xmath143  @xmath7 , yielding again @xmath140 .",

    "our tests thus indicate that systematic uncertainties on the smbh mass are @xmath11  @xmath4 , likely of the order of the quoted statistical @xmath8 errors .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the stellar @xmath9 are estimated to be @xmath10  @xmath7 , larger than the quoted statistical @xmath8 errors .",
    "here we do not explicitly consider the effects of potential spatial variations of the stellar @xmath9 onto the smbh mass error budget .",
    "this could however lead to non - negligible uncertainties , and we plan to test for this in a future work .",
    "the uncertainties on the stellar @xmath9 and smbh mass would also increase by considering e.g. , galaxy distance and _ hst _ photometric zero point uncertainties .",
    "we further comment that the @xmath38 in our fit is calculated by considering only the rms noise level in the cube as the observational error .",
    "including other sources of error would possibly increase the error on the fitting parameters .",
    "carma and alma observations just recently revealed that molecular gas kinematics enables smbh mass measurements in nearby galaxies ( e.g.  ngc  4526 , @xcite ; ngc  1097 , @xcite ; ngc  1332 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , when comparing to models , the first two studies only used a rotation curve extracted from a position - velocity diagram ( pvd ) taken along the galaxy major axis .",
    "the procedure can be briefly summarised : ( 1 ) determine the kinematic major axis and draw a pvd along it ; ( 2 ) estimate the mean velocity at each position along the pvd to determine the rotation curve ; ( 3 ) compare these velocity measurements with analogous ones made from a model rotation curve extracted from a model data cube ( assuming a set of model parameters ) in an identical manner ; ( 4 ) identify the best - fit model parameters using a @xmath38 analysis throughout parameter space .    in this sub - section ,",
    "we thus re - derive the smbh mass of ngc  3665 by fitting only the rotation curve extracted from our data , to verify that the value derived is in agreement with the full data cube fit of the previous sections .",
    "first , we fixed all molecular gas disc parameters to those obtained from the full data cube fit ( see table  [ table : params ] ) , leaving only the smbh mass and stellar @xmath9 as free model parameters .",
    "we then extracted the kinematic major - axis pvd from our data cube , and fit a gaussian to the line - of - sight velocity distribution at each position to determine the mean velocity at that position , only keeping for the model fit measurements with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath144 .",
    "the uncertainty at each position was set to the root mean square of the channel width of the observation and the fwhm of the fitted gaussian .",
    "if the gaussian fwhm was too large , generally indicating a bad fit , we also excluded that position from the model fit .",
    "a total of @xmath145 mean velocity measurements were thus made along the extracted pvd , creating an observed rotation curve along the kinematic major - axis of ngc  3665 .",
    "model data cubes are generated for a range of smbh mass and @xmath9 values , and model rotation curves extracted in the same manner as for the data .",
    "these are then compared to the data in a @xmath38 manner .",
    "figure  [ fig : pvdchiscont ] shows @xmath38 contours in the parameter space . by taking the average of upper and lower edge of the lowest contour level ( @xmath146 ) , we first determine the stellar @xmath147  @xmath7 ( grey shaded area in figure  [ fig : pvdchiscont ] ) as a range to extract the @xmath38 distribution of the smbh mass .",
    "the @xmath38 values are then marginalized over the @xmath9 range , and a polynomial fit to the @xmath38 is determined .",
    "@xmath148 distribution of @xmath147  @xmath7 ( grey circles ) , marginalized values ( black crosses ) and the polynomial fit ( black line ) are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : pvderr ] .",
    "the minimum @xmath38 for the polynomial fit along the smbh mass axis , thus @xmath149 , is realized with the smbh mass of @xmath150 .",
    "a polynomial fit to the @xmath38 distribution along the @xmath9 is then determined with the smbh mass fixed to @xmath150 ( along the vertical black line in figure  [ fig : pvdchiscont ] ) , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : pvderr ] .",
    "the uncertainties on each parameter were estimated from the @xmath109 confidence interval ( i.e.  the parameter values with @xmath151 ) .",
    "the best - fit smbh mass and stellar @xmath9 are then @xmath152  @xmath4 and @xmath153  @xmath7 , respectively , with a @xmath154 of @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( the number of degrees of freedom here is @xmath157 , allowing for the two free parameters ) .",
    "we note that the minimum @xmath48 is above unity , suggesting the existence of a better fit with other molecular gas disc parameters . a scatter seen in the @xmath38 distributions ( see figure  [ fig : pvderr ] ) can produce a systematic error for each parameters , but we do not further discuss about this here .",
    "we do not expect the systematic error of smbh mass to be larger than @xmath158 and @xmath9 to be larger than @xmath159  @xmath7 , both of which is derived in section  [ subsec : err ] .",
    "we stress that the smbh soi is not resolved in our observations , and the keplarian motion is not seen in our pvd .",
    "resolving the smbh soi can narrow down the error budget of the smbh mass in this rotation curve analysis .",
    "a comparison of the observed and best - fit model pvd and their associated rotation curves is also shown in figure  [ fig : pvdfitting ] .",
    "the two parameters for each panel are @xmath160 with a best - fit @xmath161  @xmath7 ( left panel ; @xmath162 ) , the best - fit @xmath163  @xmath4 and @xmath164  @xmath7 ( middle panel ; @xmath165 ) and an overweight smbh with @xmath166  @xmath4 and @xmath167  @xmath7 ( right panel ; @xmath168 ) .",
    "contours in the parameter space of smbh mass and stellar @xmath9 .",
    "the contour levels are set to be @xmath146 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 . a grey shaded box and a black line indicate positions of cuts along each axes for the polynomial fits in figure  [ fig : pvderr ] . ]     for the free parameters , smbh mass ( left ) and stellar @xmath9 ( right ) .",
    "grey circles in the left panel are the actual @xmath173 achieved with the stellar @xmath164 to @xmath174 ( from within the grey shaded area in figure  [ fig : pvdchiscont ] ) , and black crosses are values marginalized over the @xmath9 .",
    "right panel shows a polynomial fit to the distribution of @xmath173 at @xmath175 ( cut along the vertical black line in figure  [ fig : pvdchiscont ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty of each parameter ( @xmath8 confidence level ) is determined by the intersection of the polynomial fits with the straight horizontal line ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are then @xmath177  @xmath4 and @xmath178  @xmath7 . ]",
    "the smbh mass and stellar @xmath9 derived from the rotation curve fit are both consistent with those obtained from the full data cube fit , despite the very small uncertainties on the @xmath9 ratios .",
    "in fact , the uncertainties derived are also very similar .",
    "the two fitting methods therefore appear equally useful a priori .",
    "this is probably because the rotation curve fit extracts the crucial part of the data cube , most closely related to the mass of the smbh and stellar body .",
    "however , we recall that the rotation curve fit has only @xmath29 free parameters , compared to @xmath31 for the data cube fit . the other parameters , taken from the data cube fit , were fixed during the rotation curve fit .",
    "the data cube thus contains a lot of information useful to constrain many other model parameters associated with the structure of the molecular gas disc itself ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "in addition , a major disadvantage of the rotation curve fit is that some parameters can be degenerate with the smbh mass or stellar @xmath9 , and therefore must be independently constrained ( e.g.  the disc inclination , that directly affect the @xmath9 and to a lesser extent the smbh mass ) . extracting the appropriate pvd also requires a well - defined kinematic major axis , that is difficult to specify when the velocity field shows warps and/or kinematic twists .",
    "a middle ground is to fit an extracted velocity field .",
    "for example , @xcite considered warped and misaligned ellipses to model the ionised gas velocity field of ngc  5128 ( centaurus  a ) . in ngc  3665",
    ", however , there is no significant evidence for non - circular motions .",
    "models with warped structures may nevertheless be required in the future , as highly detailed gas distributions gradually become available through higher angular resolution observations .",
    "we present carma @xmath0co@xmath1 observations of the early - type galaxy ngc  3665 with @xmath2 resolution . these reveal a regularly rotating molecular gas disc in the equatorial plane of the galaxy , with an apparent void within a radius of @xmath111 or @xmath112  pc , potentially created by the known agn .",
    "fitting the entire observed data cube of ngc  3665 with a model with free smbh mass , stellar @xmath9 , and numerous parameters describing the structure of the molecular gas disc , we derive a smbh mass of @xmath179  @xmath4 and a stellar @xmath9 of @xmath6  @xmath7 at @xmath8 confidence levels ( statistical error ) .",
    "the soi of the smbh is thus estimated to be @xmath51 , which is half of the synthesized beam .",
    "the central hole in the gas disc ( @xmath52 ) limits our gas tracer to radii outside the soi , and all of the dynamical constraints on the smbh mass come from model fitting to data outside of the soi , where stellar mass is dominant .",
    "this smbh mass is in agreement with that estimated from the latest @xmath12 correlations , and appears consistent with the known agn properties of ngc  3665 , such as its radio jet and x - ray luminosity .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the stellar @xmath9 are estimated to be @xmath10  @xmath7 , by considering smaller fitting regions and several different mge models .",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainties on the smbh mass to be @xmath11  @xmath4 , which is within the statistical @xmath8 error .",
    "the full data cube fit also yields a smbh mass consistent with that derived from a fit to the rotation curve only , but it opens the door to smbh mass measurements in sources with significantly more complex molecular gas discs .",
    "this work is only the fourth smbh mass measurement using molecular gas kinematics , following measurements in two other lenticular galaxies and one barred spiral @xcite .",
    "this method has thus now proven its usefulness to derive smbh masses in various types of galaxies .",
    "it offers exciting prospects to both calibrate smbh masses measured with other methods , and to simply increase the number of galaxies with reliable smbh masses .",
    "further investigations comparing smbh masses measured using other methods ( stellar kinematics , ionised - gas kinematics and/or megamasers ) will be required before a proper discussion of potential systematic differences between the different methods is possible .",
