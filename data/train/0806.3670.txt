    "psr  b0540 - 69 is situated in the large magellanic cloud , and is one of the few known extragalactic pulsars .",
    "its pulsed emission was discovered by seward et al .",
    "( 1984 ) in the soft x - ray band with the _ einstein _ observatory , and thereafter also in the optical ( middleditch & pennypacker , 1985 ) and radio bands ( manchester et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "this pulsar is usually referred as the `` crab twin '' , because of the similar period and period derivative with respect to the well known crab pulsar ( psr  b0531 + 21 , see table [ t : crabvs0540 ] for a comparison ) .",
    "however , their pulse shapes are strongly different : for the crab it consists of two peaks , with a phase separation of about 0.4 , that are visible at all wavelengths , while psr  b0540 - 69 has a single , broadly symmetric pulse about 0.5 wide in phase , with some structure at the maximum .",
    ".comparison between various parameters for crab pulsar ( psr  b0531 + 21 ) and psr  b0540 - 69 .",
    "data are from the atnf pulsar database , available at ` http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/ ` . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         the spectral analysis of the total ( pulsar + pwn ) and pulsed emission from psr  b0540 - 69 , described in the previous section , is summarized in table [ t : fitresults ] .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of the total and pulsed emission are plotted in figure [ f : sed ] .",
    "the agreement between the various instruments in the 110 kev band is very good , both for the total emission and the pulsed one .",
    "it s clearly visible how the pulsed emission accounts only for about 20% of the total emission in the soft and hard x - rays .",
    "the ratio of the total source flux to the pulsed flux is in fact @xmath0 in the 20100 kev band ( isgri total versus hexte pulsed spectrum ) and @xmath1 in the 210 kev band ( xrt total versus pca pulsed spectrum ) .",
    "therefore , subtracting the pulsed flux from the total one to evaluate the pwn emission in the range 1100 kev , we obtain an energy - dependent flux ratio @xmath2 between 2.5 around the peak of the pulsed emission at about 12 kev , and @xmath36 at the range boundary . integrating over the whole energy range",
    ", we derive a luminosity ratio @xmath4 .",
    "this value is expected to correspond also to the ratio between the efficiencies @xmath5 of conversion of the spin - down luminosity @xmath6 to electromagnetic radiation , and is in agreement with the mean value ( @xmath34 ) for a large sample of x - ray pulsars ( kargaltsev & pavlov , 2008 )    for the total energy conversion efficiency , using @xmath7 erg / s , we obtain a value of @xmath8% for the 20100 kev energy range .",
    "the pwn emission contributes to this figure for the 4.6% , while the pulsed emission for the 1.2% .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath9% for the 210 kev energy range ( pwn : 3.9% , pulsar 1.3% ) .",
    "if we subtract the log - parabolic , pulsed spectrum to the power - law , total spectrum , we can derive an approximate photon index for the nebular spectrum .",
    "for the 210 kev band we obtain @xmath10 , slightly softer than that of the total emission , in agreement with the mean photon index of chandra nebular and offpulse spectra ( @xmath11 , kaaret et al . ,",
    "2001 ) .",
    "petre et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have shown that in the 110 kev band the pwn photon index increases from a value of @xmath31.4 near the pulsar , to @xmath32.5 at a radius of 4 .",
    "the nebular size , however , shrinks with the energy .",
    "an extrapolation of the relation found by petre et al . to the ibis energy range results in a pwn radius of about 2.5 : inside this radius , the mean photon index is about 1.8 .",
    "again , this is consistent with the derived pwn spectrum obtained subtracting the pulsed contribution to the total spectrum . for the 20100 kev band ,",
    "being after the peak of the pulsed spectrum , the pwn has an harder spectrum than the total emission , with a photon index around 1.8 .",
    "this qualitative agreement , however , relies on the assumptions that both the nebular photon indices and the parameterization of the nebular radius could be extrapolated to the hard x - rays , and of course it is affected by the low statistics data for both the total and the pulsed emission .",
    "it is interesting to compare the soft @xmath12-ray properties of psr  b0540 - 69 with the other integral - detected pulsar / pwn systems ( psr  j1846 - 0258 , mcbride et al . , 2008 ;",
    "psr  j1617 - 5055 , landi et al . , 2007 ; vela , hoffmann et al . , 2006 ;",
    "psr  j1513 - 5906 , forot et al .",
    ", 2006 ; psr  j1811 - 1925 , dean et al . , 2008 ) . with @xmath13% for the total emission , this source has the highest conversion efficiency : the mean of the sample is around 1% , while vela is a notable exception with @xmath14% .",
    "moreover , the @xmath32.1 photon index of psr  b0540 - 69 fits squarely in the observed range for this sample of ibis sources ( 2.02.3 ) .",
    "the majority of these systems have the hard x - ray emission dominated by the pwn , except for psr  j1617 - 5055 and psr  j1513 - 5906 .",
    "the relative contribution from the pulsar and the pwn , however , differs very much from source to source",
    ". a more detailed comparison will be the subject of a future paper ( dean et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "most of the integral galactic pwns are likely associated with hess tev sources ( e.g. psr  j1617 - 5055 and psr  j1811 - 1925 ) . however , estabilishing the psr  b0540 - 69 possible nebular tev emission is difficult , because of the low declination of this source and , mainly , of the high distance .",
    "if we assume that the synchrotron nebula powered by psr  b0540 - 69 has the same intrinsic tev brightness of the crab , the ground flux is reduced to a value of the order of some millicrab ( by a factor @xmath3400 ) . very long",
    "( @xmath15100 h ) dedicated hess pointings , therefore , are required to detect the possible emission ( hofmann , 2001 ) .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that this system lacks an appreciable intrinsic tev emission .",
    "it is thought ( de jager & djannati - ata , 2008 ) that efficient high energy @xmath12-ray emission is suppressed when the synchrotron losses dominates over the inverse compton losses , and this can happen , for example , for high magnetic energy densites or low background radiation fields , although there is no compelling evidence for both hypotheses .",
    "petre et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , under reasonable assumptions , derive an equipartition magnetic field for the pwn , and found a value of @xmath16 g , higher than that estimated for the crab by a factor @xmath32 - 3 ( de jager & harding , 1992 ) , and implying a synchrotron lifetime of electrons of about 3 years . the efficiency for the very high energy ic emission should therefore be lower with respect to the crab , making further difficult the detectability of tev flux .",
    "it will be interesting to see if glast will be able to detect nebular emission in the gev range , and to check if the derived pwn parameters are consistent with the previous estimates .",
    "note also that an egret source , 3eg  j5033 - 6916 , is located about 0.6@xmath17 south - east from the pulsar ( thus compatible with the psf radius ) , but its association with psr  b0540 - 69 is unlikely .",
    "this @xmath12-ray source has been interpreted as due to diffuse emission originating from the interaction between cosmic rays and the lmc interstellar medium ( sreekumar et al . , 1992 ; lin et al .",
    ", 1996 ) , and the observed flux is consistent with the theoretical predictions ( fichtel et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "massaro et al . ( 2006 ) developed a phenomenological model of the crab pulsar x and @xmath12-ray emission , explained as due to two different emission components @xmath18 and @xmath19 , having a log - parabolic spectrum with the same curvature ( @xmath20 ) but different energy peaks and phase distributions .",
    "this multicomponent ( mc ) model also describes the energy variations of the pulse profile .",
    "the @xmath12-ray emission above 10 mev is well reproduced , both in the total and phase - resolved spectra , assuming that the @xmath18 and @xmath19 have an higher - energy counterpart @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with the same phase distributions and the same log - parabolic spectra at different peak energies .    in figure",
    "[ f : rescaled ] the pulsed spectra of both psr  b0540 - 69 and crab are plotted , rescaled for the distance values ( we assumed @xmath23 kpc and @xmath24 kpc , respectively ) , together with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 components of the crab mc model .",
    "the emission of psr  b0540 - 69 is higher by a factor of about 2 than the crab , although the true value is strongly dependent on the assumed distance ( see schaefer et al .",
    ", 2008 , for a discussion on the lmc distance value ) , but also on the difference in the solid angle subtended by the emission beam , here assumed to be isotropic . if we adopt the distance values from hstkp ( @xmath25 kpc , freedman et al . , 2001 )",
    ", the luminosity ratio lies in the range of 1.13.7 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although psr  b0540 - 69 spectral curvature is larger ( @xmath26 versus @xmath20 for the crab ) , the peak energy is sensibly close to the @xmath27 kev value of the @xmath18 component of the mc model .",
    "the absence of a variation with energy of the light curve also makes plausible the interpretation that the psr  b0540 - 69 emission is only due to its counterpart of the crab @xmath18 component .",
    "the pulse shapes of these pulsars are however very different , and this could be due either to different viewing conditions or to unlike properties of the emission regions .",
    "takata & chang ( 2007 ) recently developed an outer - gap model of crab and psr  b0540 - 69 emission , extending the emission region also inside the null - charge surface , along the last closed field line .",
    "their results are in broad agreement with the mc phenomenological model , if we identify the @xmath18 component as due to the emission beyond the null charge surface to the light cylinder , and the @xmath19 component as coming from the region below the null charge surface up to the neutron star surface . in their model ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is due to synchrotron emission from secondary e@xmath28 pairs , and has a curved shape similar to our log - parabolic fit .",
    "takata & chang ( 2007 ) explain the different pulse shapes of crab and psr  b0540 - 69 assuming a different inclination angle ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ) between the spin axis and the magnetic axis , and a different viewing angle @xmath31 .",
    "also , the latter pulsar has a thicker emission region of the secondary pairs .",
    "if we assume that also psr  b0540 - 69 has a @xmath21 component at the same peak energy ( 300 mev ) of the crab equivalent , and with the same relative normalizations of the two log - parabolic spectra , we can obtain a value of the flux at the peak frequency : @xmath32 mev  @xmath33  s@xmath34 .",
    "this @xmath12-ray flux prediction is of the same order of magnitude with respect to the one derived from takata & chang ( 2007 ) by inverse compton scattering .",
    "the predicted pulsed flux is about one order of magnitude lower than the @xmath35 one - year glast survey sensitivity .",
    "note that the egret upper limit ( thompson et al . , 1994 ) is about @xmath36 mev  @xmath33  s@xmath34 in the energy range above 100 mev .",
    "psr  b0540 - 69 is an interesting young pulsar , showing many similarities but also some differences with respect to the crab .",
    "the study of this pulsar , although made difficult by its high distance and apparent faintness , could help the theoretical understanding of the characteristics of the high - energy emission from the pulsars and their pwns .    with the analysis of the complete rxte dataset of observations of psr  b0540 - 69 , exploiting for the spectral analysis the longest gain epoch that spans more than half of these data , together with that of new swift / xrt and integral / ibis data , we have compiled an accurate and up - to - date picture of the emission from this source in the x and soft @xmath12-rays , from 0.7 to 200 kev .",
    "thanks to the full hexte dataset we have also determined the contribution of pulsed hard x - ray emission to the total one .    regarding the pulsed emission , we confirm the presence of a curved spectrum , peaking at about 12 kev , well described by a log - parabolic law up to @xmath37100 kev .",
    "we have shown also that it presents some similarities with the crab pulsed emission .",
    "we have studied in detail the total ( pulsar+pwn ) emission from this source , in the energy range 0.7100 kev , and we have shown that the major ( about 7580% ) contribution comes from the synchrotron nebula .",
    "the comparison of psr  b0540 - 69 with other ibis pulsar / pwn systems shows that it has the highest conversion efficiency in the hard x / soft @xmath12-ray band , with similar spectral properties with respect to the other sources .",
    "most of these integral psr / pwn systems have been associated with hess sources .",
    "psr  b0540 - 69 looks different , in this respect , not showing evidence of emission in tev range .",
    "we have discussed the possible instrumental limitations , due to the low flux and declination , but there is also the possibility that this source genuinely lacks tev emission .",
    "future observations , especially in the hard x - ray band , will further refine this picture .",
    "high angular resolution long chandra x - ray observations will permit an accurate study of the synchrotron nebula to derive its physical parameters .",
    "additional integral pointings will increase the statistics of the total emission , while the advent of hard x - ray focusing telescopes , like simbol - x ( ferrando et al . ,",
    "2005 ) , will help to disentangle the pulsed emission from the nebular one also in the hexte and ibis energy range .",
    "moreover , deep glast observations could be useful to estabilish more strict upper limits to the @xmath12-ray emission from this source .",
    "we thank vanessa mcbride and raffaella landi for the help in data reduction and useful discussions .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for interesting comments and useful suggestions .",
