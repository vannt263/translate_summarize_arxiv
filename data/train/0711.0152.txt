    "high energy neutrino astronomy is one of the most promising research lines in astroparticle physics .",
    "neutrinos are in fact one of the main components of the cosmic radiation in the high energy regime , and although their fluxes are uncertain and depend on the specific production process , their detection would provide valuable information concerning the sources and the acceleration mechanism in extreme astrophysical environments . similarly to photons and unlike cosmic rays , they keep directional information which can be used to perform astronomy . differently from gamma rays , they are emitted only in hadronic processes and travel unimpeded through cosmological distances well above the tev energy . moreover , due to the peculiar charge assignment of neutrinos in the electroweak standard model , they may be the particles most sensitive to exotic physics .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that a measurement of their cross section on ordinary matter in extreme and still unexplored kinematical regions might unveil new physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    from the experimental point of view ,",
    "after the first generation of telescopes has proved the viability of the cerenkov detection technique under deep water ( ` baikal ` @xcite ) and ice ( ` amanda ` @xcite ) by detecting atmospheric neutrinos , one is probably on the verge of the first detections at the ` icecube ` @xcite telescope , being completed at the south pole , and possibly at the smaller ` antares ` @xcite telescope under construction in the mediterranean . additionally , `",
    "antares ` as well as ` nestor ` @xcite and ` nemo ` @xcite are involved in r&d projects aimed at the construction of a km@xmath0 neutrino telescope ( nt ) in the deep water of the mediterranean sea , coordinated in the european network ` km3net ` @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we address in a more quantitative way the question of how well a km@xmath0 nt performs in the simultaneous determination of the neutrino flux and the neutrino - nucleon cross section by using as observable the energy ",
    "zenith angular event distribution . note that , unless the spectrum is known a priori , for a nt surrounded by an isotropic medium the cross section and the flux would be completely degenerate .",
    "however , under the sole assumption that the incoming spectrum is isotropic , the different opacity of the earth in different directions  which becomes relevant above @xmath1100 tev  allows one to disentangle the two observables , as it has been discussed before e.g. in @xcite . in other words ,",
    "a nt is only sensitive to the product of cross section and flux , but the incoming isotropic flux is shielded ( via a non - trivial function of the cross section ) in a direction - dependent way , which makes possible to break the degeneracy by means of directional information .",
    "here we study this property using a parametric and phenomenological approach , rather than illustrating it with a few discrete cases from models proposed in the literature .",
    "in particular , we consider the specific case of an under - water mediterranean telescope , although most of our results also apply to an under - ice detector such as icecube .",
    "since the three different proposed sites for the under - water km@xmath0 telescopes have shown event rate differences of the order of 20% @xcite , for the sake of brevity we report the results of our analysis for the ` nemo ` site only , which shows intermediate performances .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ parameteriz ] we introduce the parameterization used for the flux and cross section . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we describe the formalism used , while our results are reported in sec . [ results ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec . [ conclusions ] .",
    "many astrophysical objects are expected to produce a flux of high energy neutrinos , possibly with energies higher than the highest energy cosmic rays ever detected , of the order of 10@xmath2gev .",
    "the center of mass energy available in a neutrino - nucleon collision for a neutrino with laboratory energy @xmath3 is @xmath4tev@xmath5 , @xmath6 being the nucleon mass . already at pev incident energies ,",
    "this is well above the electro - weak symmetry scale of @xmath7(100 ) gev and may thus reveal the onset of physics beyond the standard modelgev , have greater chances to detect significant departures from the standard model behavior , although the limited statistics likely requires future space based fluorescence detector ( for an analysis of this case , see for example @xcite ) . ] .",
    "since neutrinos only respond to weak interactions , even weak effects may be revealed by a study of the neutrino - nucleon cross sections at nts .",
    "one example is provided by low - scale quantum gravity models , see e.g. @xcite .    unfortunately , there are two major problems to be addressed in such a program : the low statistics expected at nts , which requires huge volumes and long operation times , and the ignorance of the diffuse astrophysical spectrum . at the range of energy @xmath8pev which starts to be interesting for particle physics constraints ,",
    "the natural target of nts are diffuse fluxes rather than point - like sources . on the basis of existing predictions for extragalactic fluxes",
    ", we limit our analysis to energies above @xmath9pev , where isotropic diffuse extragalactic fluxes are expected to dominate over the steeper atmospheric neutrino flux . around pev energies ,",
    "the atmospheric neutrino event rates are very small even in a km@xmath0 telescope and the only remaining background is given by penetrating muons from extensive showers due to cosmic ray events , which may require an active veto to be disentangled from the signal . given the observed behavior of cosmic ray and gamma ray spectra , it is reasonable to parameterize the neutrino spectra as a power law or , more generally , as a broken power - law .",
    "the latter parameterization would be probably needed when considering the flux over several decades of energy . however , for the following discussion most of the useful events will have primary energy @xmath10pev , and the single power - law approximation seems reasonable for a single decade in energy .",
    "the spectral index in fermi - like acceleration mechanisms is of the order of @xmath11 or slightly steeper , but this observable is expected to be determined by the data as well . in the following , we parameterize the neutrino flux ( per flavor , summing neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ) as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are normalization and flux steepness free parameters , and for @xmath15 one recovers the benchmark case of a waxman - bahcall flux @xcite .",
    "concerning the cross sections , we adopt a simple parameterization as a broken power - law where each energy interval ( fixed a priori ) has its own slope , and continuity is imposed at the boundaries .",
    "for example , the charged current ( cc ) cross section is given by @xmath16 where we assume @xmath17pev , @xmath18pev and , for @xmath19 , the expression for the first energy bin reduces to the standard value reported in @xcite .",
    "an analogous parameterization is used for the neutral current ( nc ) cross section , @xmath20 in the following , we shall consider both cases where cc and nc cross sections change proportionally to each other ( i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and the case where only @xmath23 is affected ( @xmath24 while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are set free ) .",
    "the former possibility mimics the scenario , for example , where the current extrapolation of parton distribution functions is wrong .",
    "it is more likely , though , that `` truly exotic '' new physics would manifest itself only in nc events ; the latter case is a toy model for this class of situations .",
    "there are also cases where new physics manifests additionally in changes of the inelasticity of the cross sections , but we leave them outside the range of possibilities explored in this analysis : so , we shall make standard assumptions on the inelasticity of the collisions , as reported in more detail in the next section .",
    "to perform our forecast , we follow the formalism outlined in @xcite .",
    "we generate neutrino tracks isotropically outside the earth and assume flavor equipartition due to neutrino oscillations and pion production dominance @xcite .",
    "we place then a km@xmath0 nt at the ` nemo ` site , see left panel of fig .",
    "[ nt ] . for simplicity",
    "we assume the telescope _",
    "fiducial _ volume as a cube bounded by six lateral surfaces , labeled d , u , s , n , w , and e for the down , up , south , north , west , and east side , respectively ( see right panel of fig . [ nt ] ) .    despite the different behavior of the produced tau leptons with respect to muons in terms of energy loss and decay length ,",
    "both @xmath27 and @xmath28 event detection rates are sensitive to the matter distribution in the neighborhood of the nt site . in principle",
    ", the elevation profile of the earth surface around the telescope may be relevant , similarly to what is known for earth - skimming ultra - high energy @xmath28 s at extensive air shower detectors , also investigated by some of the present authors @xcite for the pierre auger observatory @xcite by using a digital elevation map ( dem ) of the site . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dem s of the under - water earth surface provided by the global relief data survey ( etopo2 ) @xcite were used to estimate the effective aperture for @xmath29 and @xmath27 detection of a km@xmath0 nt in the mediterranean sea placed at any of the three locations proposed by the ` antares ` , ` nemo ` and ` nestor ` collaborations .",
    "it was found that the effect of the profile on the total number of events is negligible , although it may be important in the differential number of events from different directions , provided one has an excellent angular resolution . in the present analysis",
    "we take into account the underwater surface profile as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , although for the present results it plays a minor role .",
    "moreover we also take into account the radial density profile of the earth ( reported , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ contour2cc ] we show instead the marginalized constraints on couples of parameters ( contours at 68% and 95% cl ) in the case where only upgoing events can be tagged , again for five years of exposure .",
    "solid ( black ) curves correspond to the case of two bins , @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] , while dashed ( red ) curves show the results when these two bins are merged together .",
    "only the flux parameters can be determined to some accuracy , even if some sensitivity to @xmath32 and @xmath33 is still recovered in the case of two angular bins .",
    "the basic physical reason for this behavior has been discussed analytically in @xcite .",
    "as long as nc and cc cross sections change proportionally , then both the upward track rate and the upward shower rate are independent of cross sections , with or without new physics involved .",
    "if the energy dependence of the cross sections involved is the same , as we assume here for the fiducial case , the two observables ( upgoing track and shower events ) are just proportional to the integrated flux in the corresponding energy bin .",
    "the point we want to emphasize here is that without the tagging capability of downgoing events , there is little hope for nts to get meaningful constraints on the cross sections .",
    "a further binning of the upgoing events into two angular bins may only help a little bit , with the additional problem that the statistics is more limited in each bin .",
    "finally , the curves in fig.s [ contour1nc ] and [ contour2nc ] correspond to the solid ( black ) lines in fig.s [ contour1cc ] and [ contour2cc ] , but assuming that only nc are changed ( for illustrative purposes , we fix here @xmath24 for cc ) . the flux parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are quite accurately determined , in particular @xmath14 is fixed at 10 @xmath34 level , since the cc cross section contributing to tracks and , partially , to shower events is assumed to be known in this case .",
    "there is instead quite a poor determination of the nc cross section parameters , and in particular of @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , only values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are ruled out at 95% cl . this result is easy to understand .",
    "in fact , the largest contribution to nc shower events corresponds to downgoing neutrinos ; so the event rate is almost independent of the intervening matter in the neighborhood of the nt site , being simply proportional to the product of the flux times cross section .",
    "for example , at high energies the number of nc events increases more than logarithmically as function of the highest possible neutrino energy : for @xmath37 it becomes unacceptably large and thus excluded ( actually the result would diverge if @xmath38 in the unphysical case of an incoming flux with @xmath39 for arbitrary high energies . )",
    "the other relevant feature is the sensitivity only to a combination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( roughly @xmath40 , with @xmath41 for the case of fig .  5 ) .",
    "the reason is that , due to the smaller energy transferred in visible channels in nc events , the nc events collected in both our energy bins are mostly sensitive to the high energy behavior of the cross section , i.e. the second line in eq .",
    "this function depends on a quasi - degenerate combination of the two parameters , explaining the results .",
    "of course , a larger statistics at higher energies would eventually break this degeneracy , but would probably require too long exposure times .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we summarize our results by reporting the parameter sensitivity at 68% and 95% after the marginalization of the likelihood function for both scenarios of cc and nc cross sections changing proportionally ( left table ) and only nc varying and standard behavior of cc ( right table ) .",
    "the results are shown only for the best cases with both upgoing and downgoing tagged events and with track vs. shower events discrimination .",
    "in this paper we have performed an analysis of the capability of a km@xmath0 nt to disentangle the high energy diffuse neutrino flux and the neutrino - nucleon cross section in the pev energy region for the incoming neutrinos .",
    "as well known , a separation is possible by exploiting the energy  zenith angular event distribution . differently from previous treatments ,",
    "we have used a simple phenomenological parametrization for fluxes and cross sections , presenting a sensitivity analysis in a given parameter space , rather than for a few benchmark cases .",
    "our forecast is thus independent from strong assumptions on the normalization or energy dependence of the flux .",
    "the results we obtain are summarized in fig.s  [ fig2 ] , [ contour1cc ] , [ contour2cc ] , [ contour1nc ] , [ contour2nc ] , and refer both to the cases where cc and nc change proportionally to each other , or the case where only nc events are affected by new physics .",
    "one important conclusion is that the capability to tag downgoing neutrino showers in the pev energy range against the cosmic ray induced background of penetrating muons appears to be a crucial requirement to derive meaningful constraints on the cross section . in this case energy _ and _ zenith angle information on diffuse neutrino flux event rate in a nt ( upgoing vs. downgoing ) would greatly improve the diagnostic power for disentangling cross section from flux .",
    "of course , our analysis presents several approximations .",
    "in particular , while we took into account the geometry of the site ( for illustration we considered the ` nemo ` site in the mediterranean ) , we did not consider specific information on the detector geometry , efficiency , etc .",
    "also , we assumed that in muon and tau tracks the energy loss is deterministic , rather than stochastic .",
    "a more accurate account of the telescope and of the energy losses is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "yet , we expect that it would confirm our qualitative findings , while possibly worsening the accuracy with which parameters can be realistically reconstructed .",
    "since our forecasts are likely more optimistic than a realistic treatment would show , our conclusion on the importance of downgoing event tagging is reinforced . in general , the background due to single energetic muons generated from cosmic rays and surviving deep underground drops faster with energy than the expected neutrino signal , and well above the pev region the contamination should be negligible .",
    "however , detailed simulation are required to settle down this issue quantitatively ; an active veto may help pushing down in energy the region where the background can be disentangled from the signal on an event - by - event basis .",
    "for the icecube telescope , in the pev energy range downgoing muons from cosmic ray showers should be vetoed thanks to the icetop array .",
    "for the mediterranean km@xmath0 neutrino telescopes no final design is available , yet . given the importance of the present topic , we believe this is an important issue to be addressed in the design phase of these telescopes .    even in the case where no downgoing tagging for neutrinos will be available for a mediterranean nt , still its upgoing events at the pev would provide important constraints on the flux and cross section if a combined analysis of its data with icecube ones is performed . at very least",
    ", it should allow to _ test _ the hypothesis that the diffuse neutrino fluxes at the pev from the two hemispheres are consistent with each other , thus validating the hypothesis of an overall isotropic flux .",
