    "<S> the dependence of @xmath0 on hydrostatic ( he - gas ) pressure for superconducting mgb@xmath1 has been determined to 0.7 gpa . </S>",

    "<S> these studies were carried out on the same sample used in earlier structural studies under he - gas pressure which yielded the bulk modulus @xmath3 gpa .  </S>",

    "<S> the recent discovery@xcite of superconductivity in mgb@xmath1 at @xmath5 39 k has sparked worldwide a torrent of experimental and theoretical activity , reminiscent of the frenzy following the observation @xcite of superconductivity in la - ba - cu - o at a comparable temperature almost 15 years ago .  replacing @xmath6b with @xmath7b results in a sizeable isotope shift@xcite to lower temperatures which points to bcs superconductivity .  </S>",
    "<S> other experiments , such as heat capacity@xcite , photoemission spectroscopy@xcite , and inelastic neutron scattering@xcite also support the picture that mgb@xmath1 is a phonon - mediated superconductor in the weak - to - moderate coupling regime .    </S>",

    "<S> a large magnitude of the pressure derivative @xmath8 is a good indication that higher values of @xmath0 may be obtained through chemical means .  </S>",
    "<S> it is not widely appreciated , however , that the pressure dependence @xmath9 like the isotope effect , contains valuable information on the superconducting mechanism itself .  </S>",
    "<S> for example , in simple - metal bcs superconductors , like al , in , sn , and pb , @xmath0 invariably decreases under pressure due to the reduced electron - phonon coupling from lattice stiffening@xcite .  more generally , an accurate determination of the dependence of both @xmath10and the lattice parameters on pressure yields the functional dependence @xmath11   \\ $ ] which provides a critical test of theoretical models .  </S>",
    "<S> hirsch@xcite and hirsch and marsiglio@xcite have applied a theory of hole superconductivity to mgb@xmath1 and predicted that for an optimally doped sample @xmath0 should increase with pressure , in contrast to the expected decrease in @xmath0 from lattice stiffening .    </S>",
    "<S> precise structural data on mgb@xmath1 at room temperature ( rt ) have recently been obtained by jorgensen _ _ et al.__@xcite for hydrostatic pressures to 0.6 gpa in a he - gas neutron diffraction facility which yield the anisotropic compressibilities @xmath12 gpa@xmath13 , @xmath14 gpa@xmath13 , and the bulk modulus @xmath3 gpa ; the compressibility along the @xmath15 axis is thus significantly ( 64% ) larger than that along the @xmath16 axis .  </S>",

    "<S> a further dac study@xcite to 7 gpa with silicon oil as pressure medium gives the significantly smaller value @xmath19 gpa , even though the reported 2.9% decrease in unit cell volume upon applying 6.5 gpa pressure is _ less _ than the 4% decrease found in the other two dac studies@xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> the strong deviation of the `` silicon oil '' data@xcite may arise from difficulties in extrapolating the data to zero pressure to obtain the bulk modulus and/or from shear stresses arising from the solidification of the silicon oil under pressure .  </S>",
    "<S> the relatively large compressibility anisotropy in mgb@xmath1 mandates the use of hydrostatic pressure in quantitative studies , since shear stresses applied by non - hydrostatic pressure media to an elastically anisotropic sample can lead to erroneous results .    </S>",

    "<S> 1 are shown representative examples of the superconducting transition in the ac susceptibility at both ambient and high pressure .  with increasing pressure </S>",
    "<S> the narrow transition is seen to shift bodily to lower temperatures , allowing a determination of the pressure - induced shift in @xmath0 to within @xmath29 10 mk .  </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , close inspection of the data for 0.50 gpa reveals a slight shift in the transition curve near its midpoint , accurately marking the position of the melting curve of helium ( @xmath28 38.6 k ) at this pressure .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , @xmath0 is plotted versus applied pressure to 0.7 gpa and is seen to follow a highly linear dependence @xmath23 k / gpa .  </S>",
    "<S> the first data point 1@xmath30 was obtained after first applying a pressure of @xmath31 0.7 gpa at rt before cooling down to low temperatures ( @xmath31 60 k ) and reducing the pressure , yielding @xmath5 38.88 k at 0.341 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> point 2@xmath30 was measured after releasing the pressure at low temperature , giving @xmath5 39.25 k at ambient pressure ( 0 gpa ) ; no change in @xmath0 occurred after intermittently warming the sample to rt ( point 3 ) .  </S>",

    "<S> the dependence of @xmath0 on pressure for mgb@xmath1 is single - valued and does not depend on the pressure / temperature history of the sample ; such history effects do occur in certain high-@xmath0 oxides containing mobile species at rt@xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> we thus find that for he - gas pressure changes at both ambient and low temperature , @xmath22 for mgb@xmath1 is a linear , reversible function of pressure to 0.7 gpa @xcite .    in the present experiments </S>",
    "<S> the sample is surrounded by fluid helium near @xmath5 39 k for all data taken at pressures @xmath32 gpa so that the slope @xmath33 -1.11 k / gpa gives the true hydrostatic pressure dependence of @xmath0 .  </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the sample is in solid helium for @xmath34 gpa is seen in fig . 2 to have no effect on the pressure dependence @xmath35 indeed , solid helium is the softest solid known .  </S>",
    "<S> our value of @xmath8 differs significantly from those of other groups@xcite ( see discussion above ) using pressure media which are either solid at rt or freeze upon cooling down at temperatures well above @xmath36    in view of the strong compressibility anisotropy@xcite and the sizeable anharmonicity and non - linear electron - phonon coupling@xcite anticipated for mgb@xmath1 , it is likely that shear stresses of sufficient magnitude will cause appreciable changes in the pressure dependence of @xmath37 as observed for other anisotropic substances such as the superconducting oxides@xcite and organic superconductors@xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> the largest shear stresses are generated by changing the pressure on a solid pressure medium , such as steatite , or using no pressure medium at all .  </S>",
    "<S> the shear stresses generated in cooling fluorinert or other comparable liquids through the melting curve are admittedly much smaller and depend on details of the individual experimental procedures used , such as the cooling rate , change in applied force upon cooling , etc .  </S>",
    "<S> only experiment can determine whether or not the @xmath22 dependences measured in the fluorinert experiments@xcite are influenced by shear stresses .  to exclude the possibility of sample - dependent effects , </S>",
    "<S> such experiments should be carried out on a single sample .  </S>",
    "<S> lorenz _ _ et al.__@xcite have very recently carried out he - gas high - pressure studies on the same sample studied by them previously in fluorinert@xcite and find a value of @xmath8 equal to their previous value ( -1.6 k / gpa ) , within experimental error ; further measurements in the same he - gas system on a second , high - quality sample yielded the dependence @xmath38 k / gpa , a value very close to our present result .  </S>",

    "<S> the first term on the right , which comes from the prefactor to the exponent in the mcmillan expression for @xmath0 , is usually small relative to the second term , as will be demonstrated below .  </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the logarithmic derivative @xmath52 , therefore , is determined by the relative magnitude of the two terms in the curly brackets .  </S>",
    "<S> the first `` electronic '' derivative is negative ( @xmath53 for simple metals ( s , p electrons ) @xcite , but equals -3 to -4 for transition metals ( d electrons)@xcite ) , whereas the second `` lattice '' term is positive ( typically @xmath54  since in simple - metal superconductors , like al , in , sn , and pb , the lattice term dominates over the electronic term , and  @xmath55 is always positive , the sign of @xmath52 is the same as that in the curly brackets , namely positive ; this accounts for the universal decrease of @xmath0 with pressure due to lattice stiffening in simple metals .  in selected transition metals </S>",
    "<S> the electronic term may become larger than the lattice term , in which case @xmath0 would be expected to increase with pressure , as observed in experiment@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> similar results are obtained for other simple - metal superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> we now repeat the same calculation with the mcmillan equation for mgb@xmath1 using the logarithmically averaged phonon energy from inelastic neutron studies@xcite @xmath65 k , @xmath66 k , and @xmath67 yielding @xmath68 and @xmath69 .  from eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2 ) the unusually high value @xmath74    in extensive specific heat@xcite and high - resolution photoemission studies@xcite on mgb@xmath75 evidence is found for a multicomponent superconducting gap ; the latter study also reports an inconsistency in the values of the electron - phonon coupling constant from mcmillan s equation and the renormalization of the electronic density - of - states .  </S>",
    "<S> these results call into question the suitability of the isotropic mcmillan equation for describing this system .    under the above assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the rate of decrease of @xmath0 with pressure found in the present experiments on mgb@xmath1 is consistent with bcs phonon - mediated superconductivity .  </S>",
