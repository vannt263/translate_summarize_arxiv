    "electronically excited states ( and subsequently , high - v states ) can be stimulated by uv fluorescence pumped by ly@xmath6 arising either from the star or in shocks , and in regions of low gas density the resulting level populations from this excitation can be quite different from thermal excitation ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ; hasegawa et al .",

    "the data for this study were acquired for commissioning and system verification of nifs in october 2005 and february 2006 .",
    "the six t tauri stars that we observed were chosen for nifs system tests because they are either bright enough to serve as their own adaptive optics wavefront reference stars , or they have nearby companions which served to test off - axis guide performance ( e.g. hl tau , hv tau / c ) .",

    "the nifs on - instrument wavefront sensor ( oiwfs ) provides slow flexure compensation in addition to the adaptive optics correction and was used for observations of dg tau , xz tau and hl tau . for each observation , a standard set of calibrations",
    "were acquired using the gemini facility calibration unit , gcal .",
    "the calibrations consisted of : 1 ) 5 flat fields taken with the ir continuum lamp on and 5 flats with lamps off , 2 ) an arc exposure using the ar and xe emission lamps and a corresponding dark taken with the same exposure time , and 3 ) a flat field frame taken through a ronchi calibration mask which is used to rectify the spatial dimension in the ifu field .",
    "the raw ifu frames were reduced into datacubes using the nifs tasks in the gemini iraf package .",
    "the * nfprepare * task prepares the data for further reduction by attaching the mask definition file ( mdf ) to the image , adding a variance and data quality ( dq ) plane , and verifying header keywords that define the instrument configuration . the wrapper script * nsreduce * then calls other tasks to cut the ifu data into 29 different extensions for each image slice in the science , variance and dq planes ( using * nscut * ) , flat fields the data , and subtracts off a dark frame ( where appropriate ) .",
    "data that were not acquired with an offset to a sky position required subtraction of the dark images to remove hot pixels from the nifs detector .    the data for rw aur , hv tau c and hl tau were acquired by offsetting the telescope to a nearby blank sky field to measure the sky background brightness .",
    "the data frames were reduced by subtracting the corresponding sky images from the science images . for xz tau , t tau and dg tau ,",
    "no sky offset images were obtained . in these cases ,",
    "a median sky spectrum was constructed by combining the data in the spatial dimension in 0.@xmath515 circular apertures at the corners or edges of the final ifu datacube field .",
    "the resulting sky emission spectrum was subtracted from each position in the science datacubes .",
    "the data for xz tau and dg tau have very good sky subtraction because these datacubes have many spatial regions in where there is zero h@xmath2 flux .",
    "the field of t tau has much more spatially extended h@xmath2 emission , but we were able to construct a median sky spectrum from regions in the upper left corner and the middle right region of the field that had little or no h@xmath2 emission .",
    "the sky spectrum subtracted from t tau had an h@xmath2 flux of less than 3@xmath11 level of detection above the noise , and we estimate that any excess h@xmath2 emission subtraction for t tau is at a level of less than 2 - 3% of the flux in the regions that have h@xmath2 detected at s / n=12.0 ( correspondingly less at higher s / n ) .",
    "we are confident that the h@xmath2 emission from xz tau , dg tau and t tau is not severely affected by this method of sky subtraction , which worked very well in the absence of sky offset fields .",
    "after the images were processed through the * nfreduce * task , they were run through * nffixbad * to clean out residual bad pixels identified in the data quality planes .",
    "the wavelength calibration and spatial rectification were applied to the data using the * nffitcoords * and * nftransform * routines ; * nffitcoords * determines the rectification mapping and adds calibration keywords to the image headers , and * nftransform * applies the rectification to the data . by inspecting the wavelength calibration and accuracy of sky emission lines positions",
    ", we estimate that the absolute velocity accuracy of our ifu data is @xmath19 - 12 km / s ( roughly one third of a spectral pixel ) . the two dimensional images output by * nftransform *",
    "were reconstructed into three dimensional datacubes ( x , y and @xmath7 ) using the * nifcube * task .",
    "for these datacubes , the spatial coordinates were remapped onto an interpolated scale with a square pixel grid and 0.@xmath504/pixel extents on the sky .",
    "datacubes were generated for each of the on - source exposures we obtained .",
    "the multiple files were merged into a single datacube for each target by determining a centroid position and shifting and coadding the individual datacubes .",
    "this was accomplished using routines we have written to merge cubes in the idl programming environment ( beck et al . 2004 ; 2007 ) .",
    "we also observed a0 spectral type stars for removal of telluric absorption features with nifs , and these data were processed into datacubes in the same manner described above .",
    "these a0 stars were chosen based on their spectral types defined in the hipparcos catalog and because they provided a good match to the airmass of the science target .",
    "a pseudo longslit spectrum of each calibration star was extracted through the datacubes using a 1.@xmath50 radius circular aperture using the iraf task * nfextract*. these one dimensional spectra were divided by a 10,000k blackbody to remove the underlying shape of the stellar continuum .",
    "a linear interpolation was done to remove the photospheric hi br@xmath12 absorption at 2.16@xmath0 m in the a0 spectra .",
    "the science datacubes of the ysos were divided in the wavelength dimension by the spectra of the a0 calibrators using the task * nftelluric*. the long , on - source exposures for t tau and dg tau did not have interspersed telluric calibration observations , so correction of atmospheric features for these stars is poorer than might otherwise have been . the imperfect atmospheric correction for t tau and",
    "dg tau is most problematic for the @xmath12.35 - 2.44@xmath0 m wavelength regions .",
    "we estimate that the q - branch emission fluxes are affected at a 10 - 15% level for t tau and @xmath120% for dg tau because of this ( table 3 ) .",
    "the telluric correction in this wavelength region is particulary sensitive to variations and level of water vapor in the earths atmosphere .",
    "however , the data for both t tau and dg tau were both acquired during extremely dry precipital water vapor conditions ( less than 1.5 mm of water vapor ) , so the effect of the imperfect telluric correction is much less than it might have been in wetter weather . as discussed further in  3.1 , observations for hl tau",
    "were acquired in very wet weather , so the telluric correction as measured by the q - branch flux levels is to be poor .",
    "the final reduced , combined and telluric corrected datacubes for each target are discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "adaptive optics fed near ir integral field spectroscopy provides information on molecular hydrogen emission line morphologies , excitation energies , and kinematics at projected spatial resolutions of @xmath114 au ( 0.@xmath51 ) at the 140pc distance to the taurus - auriga dark clouds .",
    "figure 1 shows images of the continuum emission at 2.12@xmath0 m for each of the six stars observed for this study .",
    "these maps were constructed by fitting the continuum flux in the wavelength dimension and interpolating and removing the _ v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) h@xmath2 emission .",

    ", we constructed a median combined 1d spectrum at ifu spatial locations where the continuum flux was greater than 10% of the peak value ( a flux level of 5% was used for t tau to take into account the position of t tau s ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 in this spectrum was then compared to a 1d spectrum of the h@xmath2 emission at all other spatial locations in the ifu field , i.e. , areas where the continuum flux was less than 10% ( 5% for t tau ) .",
    "v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) h@xmath2 fluxes were determined by fitting and removing the continuum and integrating over the wavelength extent of the emission feature .",
    "typical uncertanties in the line fluxes were less than 5% , and these were determined by comparing the peak emission flux to the range of the maxima and minima in the residuals of the continuum subtraction . over the spatial field , the percent of the h@xmath2 flux that arose from the same spatial locations as the continuum emission is described by table 2 .",
    "the long exposure observations of hl tau were taken with the occulting disk , but an estimate of the on - source h@xmath2 emission was made by scaling a short 60 second ifu spectrum acquired without the occulting disk for acquisition purposes .",
    "we adopt a @xmath115% uncertainty in the on - source flux using this method , so the errors in table 2 for hl tau are correspondingly larger .",
    "the majority of the detected h@xmath2 1 - 0 s(1 ) emission is not spatially coincident with the continuum flux for all stars except hv tau c ( table 2 ) .",
    "this analysis suggests that the fraction of h@xmath2 that is coincident with continuum emission is greatest for hv tau c and hl tau , the two stars that are viewed strongly in spatially resolved scattered light .    to further investigate the level of extended h@xmath2",
    ", we also measured the emission line flux detected in spectra extracted with a 0.2 circular apertures at the location of the peak continuum emission , and compared this to a spectrum extracted at the location of the peak of the spatially extended h@xmath2 emission ( figure 2 ) . in all cases ,",
    "h@xmath2 emission was detected at the position of the central star . from this analysis ,",
    "rw aur and xz tau represented the two extremes for low versus high h@xmath2 flux at spatially extended locations .",
    "the detected h@xmath2 flux in the spatially extended spectrum was 27@xmath145% of the h@xmath2 at the star for rw aur , and for xz tau the extended h@xmath2 had 420@xmath1420% of the flux compared to the position of the brighter star .",
    "if there existed a greater level of h@xmath2 emission within 10 - 20 au of the stars than for all other regions of the ifu field , the target h@xmath2 fluxes should have been anywhere from @xmath12 to 40 - 50 times greater than what we have detected at the on - source position .",
    "based on this analysis and the data presented in figure 2 , we confidently claim that the bulk of h@xmath2 emission in these cttss arises from regions in the ifu field that are spatially extended from the continuum emission .",
    "we did not do this analysis for hv tau c where the h@xmath2 does not show strong peaks away from the continuum , and the on - source h@xmath2 emission for hl tau was estimated from the 60 second image obtained for acquisition .",
    "most of the h@xmath2 emission from rw aur and hl tau is extended to one side of the continuum flux and is consistent with the locations of the inner jets associated with the hh 229 and 150 outflows , respectively ( pyo et al .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission from t tau , hl tau and xz tau shows several extended knots , while that from dg tau and hv tau c is more continuously distributed .",
    "hv tau c exhibits an edge - on disk in molecular hydrogen emission similar to the morphology seen in the continuum , but spatially extended wings of the h@xmath2 appear to trace more flared regions of its circumstellar disk .",
    "t tau and hv tau c both exhibit h@xmath2 that extends over more than 60% of the ifu field .",
    "however , t tau has a very complex morphology with both discrete knots and emission that is more spatially continuous .",
    "the brightest area of h@xmath2 emission from dg tau shows a v - shaped morphology reminiscent of scattered light nebulosities associated with circumstellar disks viewed nearly edge - on ( e. g. padgett et al .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission from dg tau has been attributed to a warm molecular wind encompassing the hh 158 outflow close to the star ( takami et al .",
    "discussion of the morphology of the h@xmath2 and its origin in the environment of each star is continued in  4.1 .",
    "figure 3 plots the k - band spectra for the six stars we observed for this study , and table 3 shows the line fluxes for the h@xmath2 features , normalized to the _ v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) line . plotted in blue in each panel of figure 3 is a spectrum of each yso , centered at the peak of the continuum emission and extracted with the aperture size defined in the second column of table 3 ( upper region ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 fluxes in table 3 were determined by fitting and removing the continuum and integrating over the wavelength extent of the emission feature .",
    "we estimated uncertanties in the fluxes by comparing the peak emission flux to the range of the maxima and minima in the residuals of the continuum subtraction .",
    "this method resulted in conservative uncertainties for the line fluxes , these plots simulate the `` longslit '' k - band spectrum that would have been acquired acquired with a slit width corresponding to the extraction aperture size . for rw aur and hl tau , the _ v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) feature at 2.1218@xmath0",
    "m is the only h@xmath2 line detected above the continuum flux in the spectra centered on the star .",
    "conversely , hv tau c exhibits h@xmath2 with high s / n from nine transitions in its k - band spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission is spatially extended from the continuum ( figure 2 ) , and the strong stellar flux typically overwhelms the fainter h@xmath2 lines for the spectra centered on the stars ( for all",
    "but hv tau c )",
    ". hence , overplotted in green in figures 3a-3e is a second spectrum that was extracted using a small , 0.@xmath52 radius aperture centered on the peak of the _ v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) emission line identified using the h@xmath2 maps in figure 2 .",
    "these spectra , plotted in green in figure 3 , demonstrate the increased sensitivity of the ifu to extended h@xmath2 emission over traditional longslit spectroscopy ( as approximated by the blue spectra ) . h@xmath2",
    "q - branch emissions ( 2.40 - 2.42@xmath0 m ) and higher vibrational level lines of _ v_=2 - 1 s(1 ) ( 2.24@xmath0 m ) _ v_=2 - 1 s(2 ) ( 2.15@xmath0 m ) and _ v_=2 - 1 s(3 ) ( 2.07@xmath0 m ) are detected with a high level of significance in these spectra .",
    "the corresponding line fluxes of these h@xmath2 emission lines are included in the bottom region in table 3 .",
    "the green spectra were extracted in smaller size apertures and show h@xmath2 emission at a higher level of significance than the blue spectra .",
    "although both spectra are normalized to a value of 1.0 at 2.22@xmath0 m in figure 3 , the true underlying continuum flux levels are vastly different in the two . as a result of this and the fact that the apertures sizes are different",
    ", the data in figure 3 do not represent the amount of h@xmath2 emission in the on - source versus off - source spectra .",
    "however , the total off - source flux in h@xmath2 integrated over the full ifu spatial field is often greater than the on - source h@xmath2 , as described by table 2 .",
    "the spectra for hl tau presented in figure 3d have very different continuum shapes for the blue versus green plots .",
    "this likely arises from different fractions of scattered versus transmissed continuum flux for hl tau at different locations within the ifu field .",
    "takami et al . (",
    "2007 ) has shown evidence for scattered light from the outflow cavity walls near hl tau , and if the h@xmath2 emission is affected by scattering then it would make the continuum slope and line ratios appear bluer compared to reddening by ism extinction .",
    "the lower section in table 3 also shows that the flux ratio of the q(1 ) and q(3 ) lines for hl tau compared to q(2 ) is only 1.0 - 1.9 , whereas a wide range of physical excitation conditions can explain ratios in these lines of @xmath12.5 - 4.0 ( as seen for the other stars in our sample ) .",
    "we have thus detected the q(1 ) and q(3 ) emisison in hl tau at a 2.5 - 4 times weaker level than expected from typical h@xmath2 excitation environments .",
    "the most likely explanation for this discrepancy in q - branch emission is , unfortunately , improper correction of the telluric features in the 2.40 - 2.44@xmath0 m spectral region .",
    "particularly , the q(1 ) and q(3 ) branch h@xmath2 emission features have telluric absorptions that lie at a similar wavelength , and accurate correction of these features is linked to the telluric h@xmath2o vapor level .",
    "closer inspection of our data revealed that our observations of hl tau in feb .",
    "2006 were acquired when the q(1 ) and q(3 ) emissions were shifted by heliocentric velocity effects to correspond precisely with the atmospheric absorption .",
    "additionally , the k - band nifs spectroscopy for hl tau were observed in high and variable water vapor conditions ( precipital water vapor greater than 4.0 mm ) .",
    "because of these reasons , extracting accurate fluxes in the q - branch transitions was affected at significant levels by poor atmospheric correction in this wavelength region ( estimated to be @xmath1550% of the detected line flux ) .",
    "molecular hydrogen transitions that arise from the same upper state have intrinsic flux ratios that are not affected by the excitation mechanism or physical characteristics of the emission environment . as a result",
    ", the observed line ratios of the _ v_=1 - 0 q(3)/_v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) and _ v_=1 - 0 q(2)/_v_=1 - 0 s(0 ) transitions can provide a measure of the flux attenuation by extinction or scattering along the line of sight to the emitting region .",
    "the intrinsic line ratio of the q(3)/s(1 ) emission is 0.7 and the q(2)/s(0 ) emission is 1.10 ( turner , kirby - docken & dalgarno 1977 ) .",
    "we assume that most of the attenuation in line emission comes from extinction , and derive values for the a@xmath3 by dereddening the observed line fluxes assuming an ism extinction law ( a@xmath16 = a@xmath3(0.55@xmath0m/@xmath7)@xmath17 ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in the first two columns of table 4 .",
    "the q(2)/s(0 ) ratio is extremely sensitive to variations in line flux , uncertainties of @xmath110% in each feature can cause derived a@xmath3 differences of more than 20 mag .",
    "the uncertainty in the extinction is affected by imperfect telluric correction in the q - branch emission region ( 2.40 - 2.44@xmath0 m ) , and this was problematic for the spectra on t tau , hl tau and dg tau .",
    "hl tau has an q(3)/s(1 ) emission line ratio that is less than the intrinsic value , which suggests that the telluric correction was very poor and/or that scattered light could effect the extinction values ( e.g. , scattered light affects the spectra in the opposite sense from extinction , resulting in line ratios that are lower than the intrinsic value ) . for further analysis of the line ratios , we dereddened the observed line fluxes using the extinction from the h@xmath2 q(3 ) and s(1 ) lines because these lines are intrinsically brighter than q(2 ) and s(0 ) and are less sensitive to variation in the ratio ( extinction toward hl tau was assumed to be zero ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the population diagram of the ro - vibrationally excited h@xmath2 derived from the detected emission features .",
    "the level populations show that the h@xmath2 is well described by thermal excitation with a single temperature in the 1800 - 2200k range ( this is even roughly true for hl tau , even though the q - branch fluxes are affected by telluric correction ) .",

    "the maps of v@xmath21 for dg tau and hv tau c have moderate velocity shifts ( 15 - 20 km / s ) in consecutive pixels in regions with lower s / n .",
    "investigation of the data suggests that these shifts are real in the data .",
    "the shifts could arise from effects of lower s / n in the spectra or from spatially resolved , clumpy h@xmath2 emission in the vicinity of the young stars which unevenly illuminate the 0.1 width of the nifs spectral slit and cause corresponding velocity barycenter shifts ( bacciotti et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion values , @xmath25 , are listed in the fourth column of table 5 and are presented in figure 10 .",

    "the measured velocity dispersions are consistent with the value determined from the sky line , and hence with spectrally unresolved h@xmath2 emission .",
    "rw aur has a median velocity dispersion that is nearly double the sky value , and it is the only star in the sample which exhibits broad h@xmath2 emission line profiles arising from high and low velocity gas .",
    "hv tau c , t tau and dg tau all have standard deviations in the dispersion that are greater than for the sky line . some areas in the maps for hv tau c and dg tau show velocity dispersions that are less than the instrumental value , but most of these correspond to areas that also have pixel - to - pixel structure in v@xmath21 .",
    "pixel - to - pixel deviations in @xmath25 and dispersions less than the instrumental value are consistent with the interpretation that the h@xmath2 arises from spatially resolved regions of slightly clumpy , discontinuous emission that unevenly illuminate the nifs slit width .",
    "t tau and rw aur are the only two stars which exhibit statistically significant structure in their h@xmath2 barycentric velocity profiles ( figure 9 ) .",
    "further investigation of the h@xmath2 data show clear velocity shifts in the spatial location of h@xmath2 emitting regions .",

    "figure 11 shows that many of the southern knots of h@xmath2 emission that encompass the position of t tau s are bright at all wavelengths through the velocity extent .",
    "however , there is an increase in blue - shifted emission to the south of t tau , and emission in the northern regions of the ifu field is seen only in the 0.0km / s and + 29.7km / s channels . on average ,",
    "the velocity structure of h@xmath2 emission is found to vary from slightly blue - shifted in the south to slightly red - shifted by @xmath120km / s in the north of the ifu field . in figure 12 ,",

    "the very high velocity emission from rw aur extends to greater than 120km / s and more than 140 au ( 1@xmath5 ) , but little of this flux arises from the position of the star .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission from the vicinity of t tauri stars is believed to arise from both quiescent gas in circumstellar disks ( stimulated by uv / x - ray heating or from uv pumping ) as well as from shock excited molecular gas in yso outflows .",

    "2002 ; saucedo et al .",
    "2003 ; walter et al . 2003 ; herczeg et al .",
    "2006 ) , so it seems plausible that some of the near ir h@xmath2 we detect is from the corresponding ro - vibrational cascade of emission initially excited by this uv fluorescence .",
    "the small range of t@xmath4 values of 1800 - 2200k determined from the h@xmath2 level populations ( figure 4 ) suggests that most of the emission we see arises from a thermalized gas",
    ". the observed line ratios of 2 - 1 s(1)/1 - 0 s(1 ) emission in all six of the stars are also characteristic to shock excited regions ( burton et al . 1989 ; 1990 eisloffel 2000 ; davis et al . 1996 ; 1999 ) .",
    "however , this line ratio diagnostic can not exclude uv fluorescence conclusively because regions of high gas density or high uv flux can affect the population of high vibrational levels in the ir and will result in thermalized populations ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; burton et al .",
    "1990 ; smith et al .",
    "additionally , within the inner @xmath130au of the central stars ly@xmath6 emission is often very broad and is efficient at pumping the uv lyman - werner bands of uv h@xmath2 ( ardila et al .",
    "2002 ; walter et al . 2003 ; herczeg et al .",
    "hence , for all stars in our study , it is not possible for us to distinguish conclusively between uv ly@xmath6 pumping of high density gas and shock excitation as the main h@xmath2 stimulation mechanisms in the inner regions of the stars .",
    "takami et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ruled out uv fluorescence as a viable h@xmath2 excitation mechanism for dg tau based on the large mass momentum fluxes that resulted from their calculations .",
    "table 6 presents molecular hydrogen line ratios from four sets of transitions detected in our spectra which were chosen because they vary depending on different h@xmath2 excitation mechanisms .",
    "the second column shows the expected line ratios from calculations of low density gas with uv fluorescent emission by black & van dishoeck ( 1987 ) , and the following six columns present the measured values from our spectra .",
    "the line ratios for the uv fluorescent emission are dissimilar to the values we measured in the cttss , and they show particular deviation for the _ v_=2 - 1 s(1)/_v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) ratio .",
    "v_=2 - 1 vibrational levels are not populated to the extent predicted by uv fluorescence of quiescent low density gas .",
    "if uv stimulation from the central star is significant in the inner @xmath150au environs of these cttss , the h@xmath2 emission must arise from high density , thermalized gas .",
    "nomura & millar ( 2005 ) and nomura et al . (",
    "2007 ) have predicted that molecular hydrogen heated by stellar uv and x - ray emission should cause maximum gas temperatures less than @xmath11000k at distances greater than @xmath130 - 50 au from the star .",
    "thus , stellar uv or x - ray heating should produce neither the observed h@xmath2 level populations with lte excitations of @xmath12000k nor the strong h@xmath2 flux we find at greater than @xmath130au distances from the stars .",
    "these models also imply that the h@xmath2 should be centered on the parent star and decrease with increasing distance .",
    "of the six stars in our sample , only dg tau and hv tau c have h@xmath2 emission that decreases with distance from the star . in both of these cases , the h@xmath2 has a morphology that seems to trace an inclined circumstellar disk ( figure 2 ) , and it extends to greater than 100au distances .",
    "uv and x - ray heating of the quiescent disk material is a viable excitation mechanism for emission in these two stars only if the current models underestimate the excitation temperatures and spatial extents of the h@xmath2 by factors of 2 - 3 or more ( nomura & millar 2005 ; nomura et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this seems unlikely since quiescent heating of material by the central star can not easily explain h@xmath2 gas at excitation temperatures of greater than 1800k beyond 50au distances .",
    "recent observations have also shown that x - ray emission can arise from shocks within the outflows themselves ( favata et al .",
    "2006 ; gdel et al .",
    "2005 ) , so spatially extended h@xmath2 could conceivably be heated locally by x - ray induced shocked emission . of the stars in our sample , only dg tau has known x - ray emission in its outflow to date ( gdel et al . 2005 ) .    for both dg tau and hv tau c , the detected _ v_=1 - 0 s(1 ) h@xmath2",
    "emission decreases with increasing distance from the central continuum flux .",
    "figure 13a and b present the spatial profiles of the h@xmath2 emission from dg tau and hv tau c plotted versus the distance from the position of the central star ( approximated for hv tau c as the center of the dark lane in the scattered light nebulosity ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 is only spatially averaged over the bright flux from the blue - shifted ( lower right in figure 2 ) and red - shifted ( right in figure 2 ) lobes of the emission for dg tau and hv tau c , respectively .",
    "overplotted in figures 13a and b are the average shapes of the continuum emission and , for comparison , a curve that follows a 1/r@xmath27 power law decrease in flux with increasing distance ( scaled to the h@xmath2 emission level at 0.@xmath524 distances from the stars ) . the h@xmath2 flux decrease with increasing distance from dg tau and hv tau c resembles ( but does not exactly correspond to ) a 1/r@xmath27 decrease .",
    "the observed h@xmath2 emission from hv tau c does not follow the structure seen in atomic emission in the known hh outflow , which shows bright knots at extended distances from the star ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "2003 ; beck et al . in prep ) .",
    "however , the h@xmath2 from dg tau does resemble the low velocity , smoothly decreasing , wide - angle atomic emission seen in the hh 158 outflow ( bacciotti et al .",
    "2002 ; takami et al .",
    "the most likely explanation for the detected h@xmath2 in the spatially extended ( @xmath1550 au ) regions around dg tau and hv tau c is from shock excited emission from a wide , slow component of the outflow ( wind ) that encompasses the collimated jets from the stars ( takami et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the spectra for t tau , hv tau c and rw aur show statistically significant shifts from the systemic radial velocity in h@xmath2 , which is a clear indicator of emission arising from shocks in the outflows ( figures 11 , 12 ) .",
    "discrete knots of h@xmath2 at spatially extended distances from the central stars are also suggestive of an origin in shock excited emission ( e.g. hl tau , xz tau ) .",
    "three types of shock excited h@xmath2 were defined and described in detail by kwan ( 1977 ) , draine ( 1980 ) and draine , roberge & dalgarno ( 1983 ) .",
    "non - magnetic shocks ( pure jump shocks ) can not explain t@xmath4 of greater than @xmath1500k because h@xmath2 is dissociated in the shock front and the gas cools by pure rotational emission in the post - shock regions ( kwan 1977 ) .",
    "dissociative shocks with magnetic precursors , or jump shocks ( j type ) , are named as such because the magnetohydrodynamical parameters are discontinuous across the shock front .",
    "continuous shocks ( c type ) have continuous parameters across the shock , they arise in regions with stronger magnetic fields , and the magnetic cushioning results in little ( or no ) h@xmath2 dissociation across the shock ( draine 1980 ; drain , roberge & dalgarno 1983 ) .",
    "the last two columns of table 6 present emission line ratios for j and c type shock calculations from smith ( 1995 ) .",
    "comparison of these model ratios with our data in the preceding columns of table 6 reveal that the c type shock calculations are consistent with the h@xmath2 line ratios in the observed spectra .",
    "aside from a factor of two difference in the observed 2 - 1 s(1)/1 - 0 s(1 ) flux , the line ratios for rw aur correspond almost precisely to those presented for the c shock model .",
    "hl tau , which is likely observed strongly in scattered light or affected by poor telluric correction , shows deviations from both shock models .",
    "variations in the model assumptions for the j and c type shocks affect the resulting calculations , and we note that the c35 and j8 models from smith ( 1995 ) are both consistent with the 2 - 1 s(1)/1 - 0 s(1 ) line ratios detected in our spectra .",
    "our goal here is not to argue details of j and c type shocks applied to these systems , but to strengthen the argument that the h@xmath2 emission we detected at spatially extended distances from the cttss is excited in shocks in the outflows rather than primarily from uv or x - ray excitation by the central star .    to date ,",
    "most of the studies that analyze differences in shock models are based on observations of outflows propagating into the ambient ism at distances of many arc seconds from the parent star ( 100s to 1000s of au ) .",
    "moreover , the level of h@xmath2 arising from shocks depends very strongly on parameters such as the local magnetic field strength and the local ionization fraction in the ambient material .",
    "typical magnetic field strengths considered by the shock calculations are @xmath11 milligauss or less .",
