    "during the last years impressive progress was achieved in the understanding of the classical and quantum capacities of quantum communication channels ( see , in particular , the papers @xcite - @xcite , where the reader can also find further references ) .",
    "it appears that a quantum channel is characterized by a whole variety of different capacities depending both on the kind of the information transmitted and the specific protocol used .",
    "most of this literature studies the properties of systems and channels described in finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "recently , however , there has been a burst of interest ( see e. g. @xcite ) in a new kind of systems , sometimes called `` continuous variable '' quantum systems , whose basic variables satisfy heisenberg s canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) .",
    "there are two reasons for this new interest . on the one hand , such systems play a central role in quantum optics , the canonical variables being the quadratures of the field .",
    "therefore some of the current experimental realizations @xcite of quantum information processing are carried out in such systems . in particular , the bosonic gaussian channels studied in this paper can be seen as basic building blocks of quantum optical communication systems , allowing to build up complex operations from `` easy , linear '' ones and a few basic `` expensive , non - linear '' operations , such as squeezers and parametric down converters .",
    "the other reason for the interest in these systems is that in spite of the infinite dimension of their underlying hilbert spaces they can be handled with techniques from finite dimensional linear algebra , much in analogy to the finite dimensional quantum systems on which the pioneering work on quantum information was done . roughly speaking this analogy replaces the density matrix by the covariance matrix of a gaussian state",
    ". then operations like the diagonalization of density matrices , the schmidt decomposition of pure states on composite systems , the purification of mixed states , the computation of entropies , the partial transpose operation on states and channels , which are familiar from the usual finite dimensional setup , can be expressed once again by operations on finite dimensional matrices in the continuous variable case .",
    "the basic framework for doing all this is not new , and goes under heading `` phase space quantum mechanics '' or , in the quantum field theory and statistical mechanics communities , `` quasi - free bose systems '' @xcite .",
    "both authors of this paper have participated in the development of this subject a long time ago @xcite . in this paper , continuing @xcite and @xcite , we make further contributions to the study of information properties of linear bosonic gaussian channels .",
    "we focus on the aspects essential for physical computations and leave aside a number of analytical subtleties related to infinite dimensionality and unboundedness unavoidably arising in connection with bosonic systems and gaussian states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii we recapitulate some notions of capacity , which are currently under investigation in the literature , and what is known about them .",
    "naturally this can not be a full review , but will be limited to those quantities which we will evaluate or estimate in the subsequent sections .",
    "a new addition to the spectrum of capacity - like quantities is discussed in subsection  ii.b : an upper bound on the quantum capacity ( even allowing finite errors ) , which is both simple to evaluate and remarkably close to maximized coherent information , a bound conjectured to be exact . in section",
    "iii we summarize the basic properties of gaussian states . although our main topic is channels , we need this to get an explicit handle on the purification operation , which is needed to compute the entropy exchange , and hence all entropy based capacities .",
    "bosonic gaussian channels are studied in section  iv .",
    "here we introduce the techniques for determining the capacity quantities introduced in section  i , deriving general formulas where possible . in the final section",
    "v we apply these techniques to the case of a single mode channel comprising attenuation / amplification and a classical noise .",
    "some technical points are treated in the appendices .",
    "consider a general quantum system in a hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "its states are given by density operators @xmath1 on @xmath2 .",
    "a _ channel _ is a transformation @xmath3 $ ] of quantum states of the system , which is given by a completely positive , trace preserving map on trace class operators .",
    "this view of channels corresponds to the schrdinger picture .",
    "the heisenberg picture is given by the dual linear operator @xmath4 $ ] on the observables @xmath5 , which is defined by the relation @xmath6x={\\rm",
    "tr}\\rho t^*[x],\\ ] ] and has to be completely positive and unit preserving ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    it can be shown ( see e.g. @xcite ) that any channel in this sense arises from a unitary interaction @xmath7 of the system with an environment described by another hilbert space @xmath8 which is initially in some state @xmath9 , @xmath10={\\rm tr}_{e}u\\left ( \\rho \\otimes \\rho_{e}\\right ) u^*,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes partial trace with respect to @xmath8 , and vice versa .",
    "the representation is not unique , and the state @xmath9 can always be chosen pure , @xmath12 .",
    "the definition of the channel has obvious generalization to the case where input and output are described by different hilbert spaces .",
    "let us denote by @xmath13 the von neumann entropy of a density operator @xmath14 .",
    "we call @xmath1 the input state , and @xmath15 $ ] the output state of the channel",
    ". there are three important entropy quantities related to the pair @xmath16 , namely , the entropy of the input state @xmath17 , the entropy of the output state @xmath18)$ ] , and the entropy exchange @xmath19 .",
    "while the definition and the meaning of the first two entropies is clear , the third quantity is somewhat more sophisticated . to define it ,",
    "one introduces the _ reference system _ , described by the hilbert space @xmath20 , isomorphic to the hilbert space @xmath21 @xmath2 of the initial system .",
    "then according to @xcite , @xcite , there exists a _",
    "purification _ of the state @xmath14 , i.e. a unit vector @xmath22 such that @xmath23 the _ entropy exchange _ is then defined as @xmath24\\bigr),\\ ] ] that is , as the entropy of the output state of the dilated channel @xmath25 applied to the input which is purification of the state @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] is the final state of the environment , and the channel @xmath28 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31={\\rm tr}_{q}u\\left ( \\rho \\otimes \\rho_{e}\\right ) u^*,\\ ] ] provided the initial state @xmath32 of the environment is pure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "> from these three entropies one can construct several information quantities .",
    "in analogy with classical information theory , one can define _ quantum mutual information _ between the reference system @xmath33 ( which mirrors the input @xmath34 ) and the output of the system @xmath35 @xcite , @xcite as @xmath36)-h(\\rho , t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath37 has a number of nice and `` natural '' properties , in particular , positivity , concavity with respect to the input state @xmath14 and additivity for parallel channels @xcite . moreover , the maximum of @xmath38 with respect to @xmath1 was argued recently to be equal to the _ entanglement - assisted classical capacity _ of the channel @xcite,@xcite , namely , the classical capacity of the superdense coding protocol using the noisy channel @xmath39 . it was shown that this maximum is additive for parallel channels , the one - shot expression thus giving the full ( asymptotic ) capacity",
    ".    it would be natural to compare this quantity with the ( unassisted ) classical capacity @xmath40 ( the definition of which is outlined in the next subsection ) ; however it is still not known whether this capacity is additive for parallel channels .",
    "this makes us focus on the one - shot expression , emerging from the coding theorem for classical - quantum channels @xcite @xmath41 \\bigr)\\right .",
    "\\left.- \\sum_{i}p_{i}h\\left ( t\\left [     \\rho_{i}\\right ] \\right )   \\right ] , \\ ] ] where the maximum is taken over all probability distributions @xmath42 and collections of density operators @xmath43 ( possibly satisfying some additional input constraints ) .",
    "@xmath44 is equal to the capacity of @xmath39 for classical information , if the coding is required to avoid entanglement between successive inputs to the channel .",
    "the full capacity is then attained as the length @xmath45 of the blocks , over which encoding may be entangled goes to infinity , i.e. , @xmath46    an important component of @xmath37 is the _ coherent information _",
    "@xmath47)-h(\\rho , t),\\ ] ] the maximum of which has been conjectured to be the ( one - shot ) quantum capacity of the channel @xmath39 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "its properties are not so nice",
    ". it can be negative , its convexity properties with respect to @xmath14 are not known , and its maximum was shown to be strictly superadditive for certain parallel channels @xcite , hence the conjectured full quantum capacity may be greater than the one - shot expression , in contrast to the case of the entanglement - assisted classical capacity . in this paper",
    "we shall also compare this expression with a new upper bound on the quantum capacity @xmath48 ( as introduced e.g. in the next subsection ) .      in this subsection we will establish a general estimate on the quantum channel capacity , which will then be evaluated in the gaussian case , and will be compared with the estimates of coherent information .",
    "let us recall first a definition of the capacity @xmath48 of a general channel @xmath39 for quantum information . intuitively , it is the number of qubits which can be faithfully transmitted per use of the channel with the best possible error correction .",
    "the standard of comparison is the ideal 1-qubit channel @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the identity map on the @xmath51-matrices .",
    "then the _ quantum capacity _ @xmath48 of a channel @xmath39 ( possibly between systems of different type ) is defined as the supremum of all numbers @xmath52 , which are `` attainable rates '' in the following sense : _ for any pair of sequences @xmath53 with @xmath54 we can find encoding operations @xmath55 and decoding operations @xmath56 such that _ @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the so - called `` norm of complete boundedness''@xcite , which is defined as the supremum with respect to @xmath45 of the norms @xmath59 .",
    "it is equal to the `` diamond metric '' introduced in @xcite .",
    "we use this norm because on the one hand , it leads to the same capacity as analogous definitions based on other error criteria ( e.g. , fidelities @xcite ) and , on the other hand , it has the best properties with respect to tensor products , which are our main concern .",
    "in particular , @xmath60 .",
    "completely positive maps satisfy @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the normalization operator determined by @xmath63)={\\rm tr}(\\rho f)$ ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath64 for any channel .",
    "we also note another kind of capacity , in which a much weaker requirement is made on the errors , namely @xmath65 for all sufficiently large @xmath66 , and some fixed @xmath67 .",
    "we call the resulting capacity the _ @xmath67-quantum capacity _ , and denote it by @xmath68 . of course ,",
    "@xmath69 , and by analogy with the classical case ( strong converse of shannon s coding theorem ) one would conjecture that equality always holds .",
    "the unassisted classical capacity @xmath40 can be defined similarly with the sole difference that both the domain of encodings @xmath70 and the range of decodings @xmath71 should be restricted to the state space of the abelian subalgebra of operators diagonalizable in a fixed orthonormal basis . in that case",
    "there is no need to use the cb - norm , as it coincides with the usual norm . according to recently proven strong converse to the quantum coding theorem @xcite , @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is defined similarly to @xmath74 .",
    "the criterion we will formulate makes essential use of the transpose operation , which we will denote by the same letter @xmath75 in any system . for matrix algebras",
    ", @xmath75 can be taken as the usual transpose operation .",
    "however , it makes no difference to our considerations , if any other anti - unitarily implemented symmetry ( e.g. time - reversal ) is chosen . in an abstract c*-algebra setting @xmath75",
    "is best taken as the `` op '' operation , which maps every algebra to its `` opposite '' .",
    "this algebra has the same underlying vector space , but all products @xmath76 are replaced by their opposite @xmath77 .",
    "obviously , a commutative algebra is the same as its opposite , so on classical systems @xmath75 is the identity .",
    "although the transpose maps density operators to density operators , it is not an admissible quantum channel , because positivity is lost , when coupling the operation with the identity transformation on other systems , i.e. , @xmath75 is not _",
    "completely _ positive .",
    "a similar phenomenon happens for the norm of @xmath75 : we have @xmath78 unless the system is classical .",
    "in fact , @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the transposition on the @xmath51-matrices @xcite .",
    "we note that since we do not distinguish the transpose on different systems in our notation , the observation that tensor products can be transposed factor by factor is expressed by the equation @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , although for a channel @xmath39 , the operator @xmath82 may fail to be completely positive , @xmath83 is again a channel , and , in particular , satisfies @xmath84 .    the main result of this subsection is the estimate @xmath85 for any channel @xmath39 .",
    "the proof is quite simple .",
    "suppose @xmath86 , and encoding @xmath55 and decoding @xmath56 are as in the definition of @xmath87 . then by equation  ( [ cbthetan ] ) we have @xmath88 where at the last inequality we have used that @xmath56 and @xmath89 are channels , and that the cb - norm is exactly tensor multiplicative , so @xmath90 .",
    "hence , by taking the logarithm and dividing by @xmath91 , we get @xmath92 if we take base @xmath93 logarithms , as is customary in information theory , we have @xmath94 .",
    "then in the last inequality we can go to the limit @xmath95 , obtaining @xmath96 , and equation  ( [ cbn - bound ] ) follows by taking the supremum over all attainable rates @xmath52 .",
    "note that base @xmath93 logarithms are built into the above definition of capacity , because we are using the ideal qubit channel as the standard of comparison .",
    "this amounts only to a change of units .",
    "if another base is chosen for logarithms is chosen , this should also be done consistently in all entropy expressions , and equation  ( [ cbn - bound ] ) holds once again without additional constants .    the upper bound @xmath97 computed in this way has some remarkable properties , which make it a capacity - like quantity in its own right .",
    "for example , it is exactly additive : @xmath98 for any pair @xmath99 of channels , and satisfies the `` bottleneck inequality '' @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , it coincides with the quantum capacity on ideal channels : @xmath101 , and it vanishes whenever @xmath82 is completely positive .",
    "in particular , @xmath102 , whenever @xmath39 is _ separable _ in the sense that it can be decomposed as @xmath103 into a measurement @xmath104 and a subsequent preparation @xmath105 based on the measurement results .",
    "this follows immediately from the observation that on classical systems transposition is the identity .",
    "then @xmath106 is a channel , and so is @xmath107 .",
    "we note that @xmath108 is also closely related to the entanglement quantity @xmath109 , i.e. , the logarithm of the trace norm of the partial transpose of the density operator , which enjoys analogous properties .",
    "in this section we recapitulate some results from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the convenience of the reader .",
    "our approach to quantum gaussian states is based on the characteristic function of the state which closely parallels classical probability @xcite , @xcite , and is perhaps the simplest and most transparent analytically .",
    "an alternative approach can be based on the wigner `` distribution function '' @xcite .",
    "let @xmath110 be the canonical observables satisfying the heisenberg ccr @xmath111=i\\delta_{jk}\\hbar i,\\;\\;[q_{j},q_{k}]=0,\\;\\;[p_{j},p_{k}]=0.\\ ] ] we introduce the column vector of operators @xmath112^{t},\\ ] ] the real column @xmath113-vector @xmath114^{t}$ ] , and the unitary operators in @xmath2 @xmath115 these `` weyl - operators '' satisfy the weyl - segal ccr @xmath116v(z+z ' ) , \\label{weyl}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is the canonical symplectic form .",

    "one can define the vector _",
    "mean _ and the _ correlation matrix _ @xmath66 by the formulas @xmath126 the mean can be an arbitrary real vector .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath66 is real and symmetric .",
    "a given @xmath66 is the correlation matrix of some state if and only if it satisfies the _ matrix uncertainty relation _",
    "@xmath127 we denote by @xmath128 the set of states with fixed mean @xmath129  and the correlation function @xmath130 . the density operator @xmath14 is called _ gaussian _ , if its _ quantum characteristic function _",
    "@xmath131 has the form @xmath132 where @xmath129 is a column ( @xmath113)-vector and @xmath130  is a real symmetric @xmath121-matrix .",
    "one then can show that @xmath129 is indeed the mean , and @xmath130 is the correlation matrix , and ( [ gaussianstate ] ) defines the unique gaussian state in @xmath133 . in",
    "what follows we will be interested mainly in the case @xmath134 .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath66 describes a quadratic form rather than an operator .",
    "therefore its eigenvalues have no intrinsic significance , and depend on the choice of basis in @xmath118 .",
    "on the other hand , the operator @xmath135 defined by @xmath136 has a basis free meaning . in matrix notation",
    "it is @xmath137 .",
    "this operator is always diagonalizable , and its eigenvalues come in pairs @xmath138 .",
    "diagonalizing this operator is essentially the same as the _ normal mode decomposition _ of the phase space , when the form @xmath139 is considered as the hamiltonian function of a system of oscillators .",
    "it leads to a decomposition of the phase space into two - dimensional subspaces , such that on the @xmath140 subspace we have ( in some new canonical variables @xmath141 ) @xmath142",
    "\\quad;\\quad    \\delta=\\hbar\\left [             \\begin{array}{ll}0&1 \\\\-1&0 \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] and all terms between different blocks vanish .",
    "the matrix uncertainty relation now requires @xmath143 , in which equality holds iff @xmath144 is the pure ( minimum - uncertainty ) state .",
    "hence a general gaussian state @xmath1 is pure if and only if all @xmath145 , or @xmath146 in which case @xmath128 reduces to a single point .",
    "we shall be interested in the particular subclass of gaussian states most familiar in quantum optics , namely , the states having a p - representation @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the complex gaussian probability measure with zero mean and the correlation matrix @xmath149 .",

    "the characteristic property of the channels considered in this paper is their simple description in terms of phase space structures .",
    "the key feature is that weyl operators go into weyl operators , up to a factor .",
    "that is , the channel map in the heisenberg picture is of the form @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a linear map between phase spaces with symplectic forms @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively , and @xmath215 is a scalar factor satisfying certain positive definiteness condition to be discussed later . because of the linearity of @xmath216 , such channels are called _ linear bosonic channels _ @xcite , and if , in addition , the factor @xmath217 is gaussian , @xmath39 will be called a _ gaussian channel_. in terms of characteristic functions , equation  ( [ linbos ] ) can be written as @xmath218 where @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the characteristic functions of input state @xmath1 and output state @xmath221 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we will make use of following key properties :    \\(a ) the dual of a linear bosonic channel transforms any polynomial in the operators @xmath222 into a polynomial in the @xmath33 of the same order , provided the function @xmath217 has derivatives of sufficiently high order .",
    "this property follows from the definition of moments by differentiating the relation ( [ linbos ] ) at the point @xmath223 .",
    "\\(b ) a gaussian channel transforms gaussian states into gaussian states .",
    "this follows from the definition of gaussian state and the relation ( [ ce ] ) .",
    "\\(c ) linear bosonic channels are covariant with respect to phase space translations .",
    "that is if @xmath224 is a shift of @xmath1 by @xmath225 , @xmath221 $ ] is similarly shifted by @xmath226 .",
    "there is a dramatic difference in the capacities of a gaussian channel for classical as opposed to quantum information .",
    "classical information can be coded by using phase space translates of a fixed state as signal states , so the output signals will also be phase space translates of each other .",
    "then no matter how much noise the channel may add , if we take the spacing of the input signals sufficiently large , the output states will also be sufficiently widely spaced to be distinguishable with near certainty .",
    "therefore the unconstrained _ classical capacity is infinite_. the same would be true , of course , for a purely classical channel with gaussian noise .",
    "the classical capacity of such channels becomes an interesting quantity , however , when the `` input power '' is taken to be constrained by a fixed value , which we must take as one of the parameters defining the channel .",
    "then arbitrarily wide spacing of input signals is no longer an alternative , because an intrinsic scale for this spacing has been introduced .",
    "the remarkable fact of quantum information on gaussian channels is that such an intrinsic scale is already there : it is given by @xmath227 .",
    "as we will show , the quantum information capacity is typically bounded even without an energy constraint . loosely speaking ,",
    "although we send arbitrarily many well distinguishable quantum signals through the channel , coherence in the form of commutator relations is usually lost .",
    "surprisingly , in spite of the infinite classical capacity , the _ capacity for quantum information may be zero _ , which means that even joining arbitrarily many parallel channels with poor coherence properties is not good enough for sending a single qubit .",
    "this phenomenon will be explained in some detail in section v.    the choice of the scalar function @xmath215 is crucial for the quantum transmission properties of the channel .",
