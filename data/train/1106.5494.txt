    "of these 28 well - studied objects , 24 are blazars , implying that blazars make up an overwhelming majority of the bright vhegr sources .",
    "all of the extragalactic vhegr emitters are relatively nearby , with @xmath39 generally , and @xmath2 typical .",
    "this is a result of the large opacity of the universe to tev photons , which annihilate upon soft photons in the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , producing pairs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the standard assumption is that these pairs lose energy almost exclusively through inverse - compton scattering the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and ebl . when the up - scattered gamma - ray is itself a vhegr the process repeats , creating a second generation of pairs and up - scattering additional photons .",

    "typical numbers range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , with the latter values being of astrophysical interest in the context of the formation of galactic fields . ] .",
    "these limits on the igmf arise from the _ lack _ of the gev bump associated with the icc of the blazar tev emission , presumably due to the resulting pairs being deflected significantly under the action of the igmf itself .",
    "the wide range in the estimates upon the minimum igmf is due primarily to different assumptions about the tev blazar duty cycle .",
    "has also provided the most precise estimate of the unresolved extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egrb ) for energies between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "since iccs reprocess the vhegr emission of distant sources into this band , this has been used to constrain the evolution of the luminosity density of vhegr sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , it has been found that these can not have exhibited the dramatic rise in numbers by @xmath50@xmath51 seen in the quasar distribution .",
    "that is , the comoving number of blazars must have remained essentially fixed , at odds with both the physical picture underlying these systems and with the observed evolution of similarly accreting systems , i.e. , quasars .",
    "both of these conclusions depend critically upon iccs dominating the evolution of the ultra - relativistic pairs .",
    "however , as we will show , the pairs constitute a cold , highly collimated plasma beam moving through a dense , stationary background , both of which are susceptible to collective plasma phenomena .",
    "such beams are notoriously unstable ; for instance , equal density beams typically lose a significant fraction of their energy after propagating distances measured in plasma skin depths of the background plasma .",
    "if the vhegr - generated pairs suffer a similar fate while propagating through the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , the cooling of the pairs would be dominated by plasma instabilities , thereby quenching the iccs .    here",
    "we present a plausible alternative mechanism by which the energy in the ultra - relativistic pairs can be extracted . while a variety of potential plasma beam instabilities exist , we find that the most relevant for the vhegr - produced pair beams is the `` oblique '' instability @xcite .",
    "this is a more virulent cousin of the commonly discussed weibel and two stream instabilities .    in section [ sec : pbs",
    "] we discuss the formation and properties of the ultra - relativistic pair beam , including limits upon its temperature and density .",
    "section [ sec : pbis ] presents growth rates for a variety of plasma instabilities , including the oblique instability .",
    "particular attention is paid to if and when plasma instabilities dominate inverse compton as a means to dissipate the kinetic energy of the pairs .",
    "the resulting implications for studies of the igmf are described in section [ sec : implications igmf ] , including how such efforts might mitigate the systematic uncertainties arising from plasma cooling .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function of vhegr - emitting blazars is discussed in section [ sec : blf ] , in which we construct a blazar luminosity function based upon that of quasars which is consistent with current tev source populations and the estimates of the egrb .",
    "finally , conclusions are contained in section [ sec : c ] .",
    "this is the first in a series of three papers that discuss the potential cosmological impact of the tev emission from blazars .",
    "here we provide a plausible mechanism for the local dissipation of the vhegr luminosity of bright gamma - ray sources .",
    "in addition to the particular consequences this has for studies of high - energy gamma - ray phenomenology , it also provides an novel heating process within the igm .",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) estimates the magnitude of the new heating term , describes the associated modifications to the thermal history of the igm , and shows how this can explain some recent observations of the forest .",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) considers the impact the new heating term has upon the structure and statistics of galaxy clusters and groups , and upon the ages and properties of dwarf galaxies throughout the universe , generally finding that blazar heating can help explain outstanding questions in both cases .",
    "an additional follow - up paper by @xcite shows that when combined with most recent estimates of the evolving photoionizing background and hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure formation , the heating by blazars results in excellent quantitative agreement with observations of the mean transmission , one- and two - point statistics , and line width distribution of high - redshift forest spectra . in particular , these successes depends upon the peculiar properties of the blazar heating via the dissipation of plasma instabilities .    for all of the calculations presented below",
    "we assume the wmap7 cosmology with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 @xcite .",

    "the thick black line shows @xmath60 of unity , blue and red lines show optically thick and thin regions of the parameter space , respectively .",
    "the sudden break in the contours at @xmath61 is due to the assumed ebl evolution ( see text ) . ]",
    "sources of vhegrs are necessarily attenuated by the production of pairs upon interacting with the ebl .",
    "namely , when the energies of the gamma ray ( @xmath58 ) and the ebl photon ( @xmath62 ) exceed the rest mass energy of the @xmath63 pair in the center of mass frame , i.e. , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the relative angle of propagation in the lab frame , an @xmath63 pair can be produced with lorentz factor @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the optical depth the universe presents to high - energy gamma rays depends solely upon the energy of the gamma ray and the evolving spectrum of the ebl .",
    "detailed estimates for the ebl spectrum and its evolution have produced an estimated mean free path of tev photons of @xmath67 where the redshift evolution is due to that of the ebl alone , is dependent predominately upon the star formation history , and @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 @xcite and declines rapidly afterward , galaxies and type 1 active galactic nuclei compensate for the lost flux until @xmath61 .",
    "see , for example , figure 3 from @xcite . ] .",

    "] from this it is evident that above @xmath49 the universe is optically thick to sources at @xmath75 ( cf .",
    "a related , and perhaps more appropriate measure of the optical depth is that across a hubble length , @xmath76 , shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : taus ] , providing a sense of how opaque the universe is as a function of redshift . in all cases",
    "it is clear that at @xmath0 photons will pair - produce on the ebl for @xmath77 . in the future",
    "this may not be the case , since for sufficiently small @xmath56 , @xmath59 decreases with decreasing @xmath56 due to the dramatic decrease in the ebl photon density associated with both the hubble expansion and the slowing of star formation .",
    "the pairs produced by the tev gamma rays are ultra - relativistic , with typical lorentz factors of @xmath78 .",
    "they also necessarily constitute a cold , highly anisotropic , dilute beam propagating through the igm .",
    "this follows immediately from the intergalactic distances traversed by the gamma rays and the comparatively small ebl photon energies ( as seen in the igm frame ) .",
    "here we estimate the properties of this plasma beam .",
    "the momentum dispersion of the resulting pairs is set by the gamma - ray spectrum , geometry of the tev source , distribution of the ebl photons , and heating due to pair production .",
    "of these , only the last plays a significant role in setting the transverse momentum dispersion . , is @xmath79 . with @xmath80 ,",
    "implied by the x - ray variability timescales @xcite , this gives @xmath81^\\zeta \\left(e/\\tev\\right)^2 $ ] .",
    "similarly , since the creation of pairs is dominated by ebl photons near the pair - production threshold , the typical energy of the relevant ebl photons is roughly @xmath82 ( i.e. , twice the threshold value for transverse ebl photons ) , and thus @xmath83 . ] the center - of - mass frame , i.e. , the `` beam frame '' , momentum dispersion resulting from pair production is roughly @xmath84 .",
    "this results in an igm - frame transverse momentum dispersion of @xmath85 . with @xmath86 ,",
    "the temperature associated with this transverse momentum dispersion is @xmath87 since the transverse momentum dispersion of the pairs is much smaller than that associated with the bulk motion of the beam ( i.e. , since @xmath88 ) , we may safely assume that the beam is transversely kinematically cold .    ) at a number of redshifts ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in all cases @xmath89 , corresponding to a mean - density region , and the isotropic - equivalent luminosity of the source at energy @xmath58 , @xmath90 , is @xmath91 , similar to the brightest tev blazars seen from earth .",
    "finally , we list the initial pair lorentz factor , @xmath92 , and cooling lengthscale along the top and right axes , respectively . ]",
    "the density of the pair beam at a given point within the igm is set by the rate at which pairs are produced , duration of the tev emission , advection of the pairs through the igm , and the processes by which they lose their kinetic energy .",
    "that is , the evolution of the density of pairs per unit lorentz factor , @xmath93 , is governed by the boltzmann equation : @xmath94 where the left - hand side assumes all the pairs are moving away from the tev source relativistically ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , and the right - hand side corresponds to pair production .",
    "generally , we may neglect advection , which alters @xmath93 over timescales of @xmath97 , much longer than any relevant timescale of interest here ( i.e. , @xmath98 may be neglected ) .",
    "furthermore , for most of the potential sources we will consider ( primarily tev blazars ) we will assume that the duration of the tev emission is sufficiently long that @xmath93 reaches a steady state ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) .",
    "in this case , we have @xmath100 .",
    "making further progress requires us to define the spectrum of the pairs , which itself depends upon the spectrum of the gamma rays and the energy dependence of the cooling processes .",
    "nevertheless , we may obtain an estimate of the beam density in the vicinity of a given lorentz factor , @xmath101 , by setting @xmath102 .",
    "the source term is given by twice ( since each gamma - ray produces two leptons ) the rate at which high - energy gamma rays with energy @xmath103 annihilate within the region of interest , i.e. , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the gamma - ray number flux , with units of @xmath106 .",
    "thus , upon defining a cooling rate @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 i.e. , the density of pairs of a given energy is determined by balancing cooling and pair creation .    generally , @xmath109 is a function of energy and beam density , as well as external factors ( e.g. , seed photon density , igm density , etc . ) .",
    "thus this gives a non - linear algebraic equation to solve for @xmath110 , the particulars of which depend upon the various mechanisms responsible for extracting the bulk energy of the beam . in practice ,",
    "given expressions for @xmath109 , associated with the processes discussed in following section , we solve equation ( [ eq : nb ] ) numerically to obtain @xmath111 .",
    "which mechanism dominates the cooling of the beam depends upon a variety of environmental factors and the properties of the pair beam itself .",
    "nevertheless , inverse - compton cooling via the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provides a convenient lower limit upon @xmath109 , and thus an upper limit upon @xmath110 .",
    "this is a function of @xmath56 and @xmath92 alone , given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the thompson cross section .",
    "the strong redshift dependence arises from the rapid increase in the cmb energy density with @xmath56 ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "furthermore , since it is @xmath115 , inverse - compton cooling is substantially more efficient at higher energies .",
    "the associated cooling rate is shown as a function of @xmath58 for a number of redshifts in figure [ fig : gs ] .",
    "when we set @xmath116 , we obtain the following upper limit upon the beam density : @xmath117 where we have defined @xmath118 to be the isotropic - equivalent luminosity ( per unit energy ) of a source located a distance @xmath119 from the region in question .",
    "setting @xmath90 to a typical value ( @xmath91 ) gives an idea of the typical pair - beam densities .",
    "note that despite the large blazar luminosities we consider , the associated beams are exceedingly dilute , a point that is of critical importance in the following section .",
    "since @xmath120 is independent of @xmath110 , this has no implication for inverse - compton cooling itself .",
    "plasma beams are notoriously unstable , with the instabilities driven by the anisotropy of the lepton distribution function . here",
    "we consider the implications of these instabilities upon the ultimate fate of the kinetic energy in the tev - blazar driven pair beams .      for collective phenomena to be relevant",
    ", it is necessary for many pairs to be present within each wavelength of the unstably growing modes . as we shall see , the relevant scale for the beam plasma instabilities we describe below is the plasma skin depth of the igm , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the igm plasma frequency and @xmath123 is the igm free - electron number density .",
    "generally , the growing mode must be uniform on scales considerably larger than @xmath124 , both longitudinally and transversely ( otherwise it is not well - represented as a single fourier component ) , and thus the volume in which many particles must be present is much larger than that defined by a sphere of diameter @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless , this gives us a conservative constraint , i.e. , we require @xmath125    with equation ( [ eq : nb ] ) this gives a _ maximum _ plasma cooling rate : @xmath126 plasma processes with cooling rates that exceed this limit necessarily saturate near this cooling rate .",
    "such a super - critical process can potentially operate only until the beam density is driven below the value at which pairs can support collective phenomena , at which point they necessarily quench .",
    "however , after plasma cooling ceases , the plasma beam density rises again ( since @xmath120 is always less than @xmath127 in practice ) , and thus the super - critical plasma cooling may resume . since the efficiency of the plasma cooling decreases smoothly to zero at the critical density ,",
    "this sequence stabilizes near @xmath127 .",
    "the associated excluded region is shown by the grey region in the upper - left corner of figure [ fig : gs ] .",
    "region of the igm .",
    "grey lines show the limit defining the applicability of the plasma prescription , below which less than a single beam lepton is found in a volume @xmath128 . below these collective phenomena",
    "are unimportant .",
    "black lines show the luminosity at which linear plasma cooling rate begins to dominate inverse - compton cooling .",
    "both limits are sensitive functions of the igm density , scaling as @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "thus in low / high density regions these limits become moderately more / less permissive . for reference ,",
    "the sources listed in table [ tab : tevsources ] are also plotted ( at @xmath131 ) , with hbl , ibl , radio galaxies , and quasars shown by the the blue triangles , green squares , red hexagons and magenta circles , respectively . filled",
    "points indicate sources that have been used to estimate the igmf ( see section [ sec : implications igmf ] ) .",
    "the only objects that fail to meet the plasma - cooling luminosity criterion are the radio galaxies m87 and cen a , both of which are detectable only due to their close proximity . ]    the upper limit upon @xmath110 obtained in equation ( [ eq : nbic ] ) implies an analogous limit upon the relevant source isotropic - equivalent luminosities .",
    "again , this arises from requiring a sufficient number of beam pairs to be present to support plasma processes .",
    "since the beam density is linearly dependent upon the source luminosity , this gives a constraint upon the latter : @xmath132 effectively defining a luminosity cut - off , below which collective plasma phenomena may be ignored .",
    "this limiting luminosity shown as a function redshift by the grey lines in figure [ fig : nblimits ] for various gamma - ray energies . while the luminosity limit does depend upon @xmath56 , it is clear that all of the observed tev blazars ( listed in table [ tab : tevsources ] ) are sufficiently luminous for their resulting pair beams to support collective phenomena at the redshifts of interest for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the only source to fall marginally below the limiting luminosity at @xmath133 is the radio galaxy cen a ( the lower - most point in figure [ fig : nblimits ] ) , the closest and dimmest object in table [ tab : tevsources ] .      within astrophysical contexts",
    "there are at least two well known beam instabilities : two - stream and weibel , the latter having been suggested as a mechanism for magnetizing strong shocks @xcite , and both implicated in the coupling at collisionless shocks @xcite . these are , however , simply different limiting examples of the same underlying filamentary instability , for which the maximum growth rate exceeds either  the so - called `` oblique '' mode , which we discuss below @xcite .",
    "note that since the pair beam is neutral , it contains its own return current and thus beam instabilities that arise due to the electron return currents within the background plasma ( e.g. , the bell and buneman instabilities , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not relevant .    here",
    "we discuss the nature of these instabilities , and their growth rates in the cold - plasma limit ( i.e. , mono - energetic beams ) .",
    "while the low - temperature approximation is unlikely to be applicable in practice for the beams of interest here , it provides a convenient limit in which to present the relevant processes within their broader context . for a similar reason , and because we have not found analogous derivations elsewhere in the astrophysical literature , we present the ultra - relativistic pair beam instability growth rates for the two - stream and weibel instabilities in appendixes [ sec : ts ] and [ sec : w ] , only summarizing the results here .",
    "we defer a discussion of the more directly relevant warm - plasma oblique instability to the following section . generally , we find that the plasma instabilities are capable of dominating inverse compton cooling as a means to dissipate the bulk kinetic energy of the pair beams from tev blazars .",
    "the pair two - stream instability arises due to the interaction of the anisotropic electron and positron distribution functions with the comoving background electrostatic wave ( i.e. , @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the electromagnetic mode wavevector and @xmath136 is the beam momentum ) with wavelength @xmath137 for @xmath138 , which is generally the case of interest here .",
    "the associated cooling rate in the cold - plasma limit is @xmath139 which depends only weakly upon the igm density and the pair beam density , though decreases rapidly as @xmath92 becomes large .",
    "the weibel instability is associated with coupling to a secularly growing , anharmonic transverse magnetic perturbation ( i.e. , @xmath140 ) .",
    "the most rapidly growing wavelength is again that associated with the background plasma skin depth , @xmath137 , with associated cooling rate in the cold - plasma limit @xmath141 which depends only upon the pair beam density and the pair lorentz factor . at large @xmath92",
    "this is suppressed more weakly than the two - stream instability , though is a moderately stronger function of @xmath110 .",
    "the computation of the growth rates of the two - stream and weibel instabilities are greatly simplified by the particular geometries of the coupled electromagnetic waves and beam momenta . however , a generalized oblique treatment has shown the presence of continuum of unstable modes @xcite , characterized by the orientation of their wave - vector relative to the bulk beam velocity . of these",
    "neither the two - stream nor weibel are generally the most unstable .",
    "rather , generically the most robust and fastest growing mode occurs at oblique wave - vectors , and thus referred to as the oblique instability by @xcite .",
    "the cold - plasma cooling rate of this maximally - growing mode is @xmath142 this can be much larger than the two - stream and weibel growth rates when @xmath138 and @xmath143 .",
    "the cold - plasma oblique instability cooling rates dominate inverse - compton cooling by orders of magnitude over the region of interest .",
    "however , at the very dilute beam densities of relevance here , the cold - plasma approximation requires exceedingly small beam temperatures . above an igm - frame temperature of",
    "roughly @xmath144 pairs can traverse many wavelengths of the unstable modes over the cold - instability growth timescale , a situation commonly referred to as the kinetic regime . as a consequence ,",
    "significant phase mixing can occur , substantially reducing the effective growth rate @xcite .",
    "the way in which finite beam temperatures limit the growth rate depends sensitively upon the nature of the velocity dispersion and the modes of interest ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the two - stream instability , associated with wave vectors parallel to the beam , enters the strongly suppressed `` quasi - linear '' regime when the parallel momentum dispersion is large , though is insensitive to even large transverse dispersions .",
    "conversely , the weibel instability , associated with wave vectors orthogonal to the beam , is sensitive to even small transverse velocity dispersions but unaffected by large parallel velocity dispersions .",
    "this is simply because a given mode can tolerate large velocity dispersions within but not across the phase fronts of the unstable electromagnetic modes .",
    "for the situation of interest here , dilute beams and cool igm ( i.e. , @xmath145 ) , the oblique modes are nearly transverse , and thus sensitive primarily to large transverse velocity dispersions .    nevertheless , even for the small temperatures we have inferred for the pair beams , we find ourselves in the kinetic regime .",
    "in this case the oblique instability cooling rate has been numerically measured to be @xmath146 where we have set the beam temperature in the beam frame to @xmath147 , and thus @xmath148 @xcite . both the cold and hot growth rates have been verified explicitly using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , though for somewhat less dilute beams than those we discuss here @xcite .",
    "when the kinetic oblique mode dominates the beam cooling the beam density is given by @xmath149 the associated cooling rate is then @xmath150 this is a stronger function of gamma - ray energy than inverse - compton cooling , implying that it will eventually dominate at sufficiently high energies , assuming a flat tev spectrum .",
    "in addition it is a very weak function of @xmath151 , being only marginally faster in lower - density regions , and thus the cooling of the pairs is largely independent of the properties of the background igm .",
    "the rates obtained by numerically solving equation ( [ eq : nb ] ) for @xmath110 , with @xmath152 , are shown for a number of redshifts in figure [ fig : gs ] .",
    "for the luminosity shown ( @xmath153 , typical of the bright tev blazars ) at @xmath154 plasma cooling dominates inverse compton above a tev . in the present epoch , @xmath155 is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath120 for bright tev blazars .",
    "the luminosity dependence of @xmath155 implies a luminosity limit below which inverse compton does dominate the linear evolution of the pair beam , @xmath156 ( note that at this luminosity @xmath157 , and thus @xmath110 is half the value shown in equation ( [ eq : nbgm ] ) ) .",
    "this limit is shown as a function of redshift for a number of different energies by the black lines in figure [ fig : nblimits ] .",
    "note that these lie above the corresponding limits associated with the applicability of the plasma prescription , suggesting that in practice the beam does support collective phenomena .",
    "the critical luminosity ranges from @xmath158 to @xmath91 , depending upon redshift and energy of interest .",
    "it also depends upon the over - density as roughly @xmath159 , and thus at low densities the critical luminosity is moderately smaller .",
    "the only two sources in table [ tab : tevsources ] which fall below the plasma - cooling luminosity limit are the radio galaxies m87 and cen a , both of which are detectable only as a result of their close proximity . at @xmath133 , all but a handful of the remaining sources lie more than an order of magnitude above this limit , and in the case of the two sources that dominate the tev flux at earth , more than two orders of magnitude above this limit . +      given the technical nature of our discussion above , it is useful to have a qualitative understanding of these instabilities .",
    "we caution , however , that intuitive pictures of plasma processes frequently fail to capture all the relevant physics .",
    "hence , generalization of these intuitive pictures beyond their limited range of applicability is potentially misleading .",
    "this is explicitly illustrated by our examples here : all of the instabilities discussed in this work belong to the same family , i.e. , instabilities that arise from interpenetrating plasmas , but the underlying qualitative pictures for each differ substantially .",
    "we begin with the weibel ( or filamentation ) instability @xcite , for which a mechanical viewpoint ( an initial magnetic perturbation deflects particles into opposing current streams that reinforce the perturbed field ) can be found in @xcite , to which we refer the interested reader . here",
    "we present picture that although having the virtue of being simpler is not entirely correct : because like currents attract , small - scale current perturbations arising out of the fluctuations within the interpenetrating plasmas will coalesce preferentially to produce increasingly larger - scale currents .",
    "these induce stronger magnetic fields , and thus larger attractive lorentz forces between neighboring currents ; a positive feedback loop develops leading to instability .",
    "this process continues until the associated magnetic field strengths become sufficiently large to disrupt the currents ( in the case of equal density beams ) or until the transverse velocity of the constituent particles is large enough to efficiently migrate between current structures on the linear growth timescale , i.e. , enter the kinetic regime .",
    "we should note that the aggregation of currents in the weibel instability does not rely upon _ oscillatory _ waves .",
    "hence , there is no oscillatory component to this instability  it is a purely growing mode .",
    "in contrast , the two - stream instability is an overstable mode , where the oscillatory components are langmuir ( or plasma ) waves with a wavevector parallel to the beam velocity .",
    "these are longitudinal waves , associated with local charge oscillations , and are completely described by a propagating perturbation in the electrical potential . as particles in the beam traverse langmuir waves in the background plasma , they experience successive periods of acceleration and deceleration , with electrons ( positrons ) collecting in minima ( maxima ) of the electric potential , where the particle speeds are at their smallest .",
    "this charge - separated bunching of the beam plasma enhances the background electric perturbation , potentially growing the background langmuir wave .",
    "the bunching within the beam is simply an excitation of langmuir waves within the beam plasma itself .",
    "thus the growth of the charge perturbations in the background and beam plasmas corresponds to the resonant coupling between langmuir waves in the background and beam .",
    "when the beam density is much less than the background density , as is the case here , background and beam langmuir waves only overlap in frequency , and therefore satisfy the conditions for resonance , when the wavevector of the latter is parallel to the beam velocity ( see the discussion above equation ( [ eq : displin ] ) ) .",
    "this is always satisfied for the family of comoving beam langmuir waves ( i.e. , waves which in the beam frame move counter to the background plasma ) .",
    "however , of particular importance for the two - stream instability are the counter - propagating beam langmuir waves ( i.e. , waves which in the beam frame move parallel to the background plasma ) .",
    "if the beam velocity exceeds the phase velocity of these waves ( as seen in the beam frame ) , the counter - propagating wave will be dragged in the direction of the beam ( as seen in the background frame ) , and therefore has a wavevector which satisfies the resonant condition .",
    "nevertheless , the counter - propagating langmuir wave still carries momentum in the direction opposite to the beam .",
    "thus , as the counter - propagating wave grows , the momentum , and therefore energy , of the beam - wave system necessarily decreases .",
    "this implies that the counter - propagating langmuir wave is also a _ negative energy mode _ as seen in the background frame . as a consequence ,",
    "the resonant coupling can transfer energy to the positive - energy background wave from the negative - energy beam wave , while growing the amplitudes of both , and thereby leading to instability .",
    "note that if the phase velocity of the counter - propagating langmuir wave is larger than the beam velocity , it no longer is dragged in the direction of the beam and no longer satisfies the necessary resonant condition . for a distribution of particles , this constraint upon the velocities within",
    "the beam corresponds to the familiar penrose criterion @xcite , and is satisfied in the pair beams resulting from vhegrs .",
    "the oblique instability encompasses the two - stream and weibel instabilities , though the most unstable mode is most similar to the former in that the intuitive picture focus solely on the electrostatic forces , ignoring electromagnetic forces . in practice , this is a relatively good approximation and can be used to calculate the growth of these modes in idealized situations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the qualitative picture proceeds similarly to that for the two - stream instability described above , with the minor modification that the perturbing background langmuir waves now move at an angle @xmath65 relative to the _ relativistic _ beam . as a consequence ,",
    "the resonant langmuir waves have a phase velocity such that @xmath160 . from the simple intuitive picture above , if @xmath65 is selected such that the projected beam velocity is slightly faster than the nearly resonant langmuir wave , an instability develops .    finally , to understand why the growth rates between the two - stream instability above and the oblique instability differ ,",
    "it is useful to make the approximation that the electric fields generated are in the direction of the k - vector . in the two - stream case",
    ", the electric field must slow down ( or speed up ) particles .",
    "this gets progressively harder for more relativistic particles . in the oblique case",
    ", the electric field deflects the particles , changing their _ projected _ velocity . while this is also",
    "more difficult for more relativistic particles , this is not nearly as hard as changing the particles parallel ( along the beam ) velocity .",
    "hence , the oblique instability more easily drives charge density enhancements ( and therefore instabilities ) at large @xmath65 , i.e. , easier deflection , than the two - stream instability .",
    "we have thus far only treated the linear development of the relativistic two - stream , weibel , and oblique instabilities .",
    "however , the impact pair beams have upon the igm , gamma - ray cascade emission , and measures of the igmf will ultimately depend upon their nonlinear development .",
    "to address this , however , we are presently forced to appeal to analytical and numerical calculations of systems in somewhat different ( and less extreme ) parameter regimes .    motivated by the applicability of the weibel instability in the context of grbs ,",
    "the nonlinear saturation of the relativistic weibel instability for equal density plasma beams is well understood analytically and numerically .",
    "initially , the weibel instability rapidly grows until the energy density of the generated magnetic field becomes of order the kinetic energy of the two beams @xcite .",
    "analytically , @xcite argued that the weibel instability would saturate when the generated magnetic fields become so large that the larmor radius of the beam particles is of order the skin depth , i.e. , when the energy of generated magnetic fields is equal to the kinetic energy of two equal density relativistic beams ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the particles rapidly isotropize with a maxwellian distribution @xcite , i.e. , heat , and the magnetic energy then rapidly decays within an order of a few tens of skin depths @xcite .",
    "hence for two equal density , relativistic , interpenetrating beams , the weibel instability converts anisotropic kinetic energy into heat .",
    "however , as we have already noted , for the pair beams of interest here the weibel instability is completely suppressed for tiny transverse beam temperatures . hence , while this instability may initially operate , it may quickly become suppressed if it results in significant transverse heating of the beam .    unlike the weibel instability ,",
    "the two - stream and kinetic oblique instabilities continue to operate , though more slowly than implied by their cold - plasma limits , in the presence of substantial beam temperatures . due to the geometry of the coupled modes ,",
    "the oblique instability is primarily sensitive to transverse beam - velocity dispersions , though shares the resistance to beam heating with its two - stream cousin @xcite . unlike the two - stream instability ,",
    "the oblique instability in the parameter range of interest here is also largely insensitive to longitudinal heating .",
    "thus , generally , it appears that the oblique instability is substantially more robust than its more commonly discussed brethren .",
    "what is less clear a priori is if these instabilities primarily heat the beam or primarily heat the background plasma .",
    "here we appeal to the numerical simulations of @xcite , where a mildly relativistic beam ( @xmath161 ) penetrating into a hot , dense background plasma ( beam - to - background density ratio of @xmath162 ) was studied . in these",
    "the oblique instability resulted in a significant fraction ( @xmath163 ) of the beam energy heating the background plasma before the heating of the beam suppressed the oblique instability in favor of the two - stream instability .",
    "the relative effectiveness with which the beam heats the background plasma is due to the efficiency with which the longitudinal electrostatic modes are dissipated in the background plasma ; unlike electromagnetic modes ( e.g. , those generated by the weibel instability ) , electrostatic modes are rapidly dissipated via landau damping .",
    "we note that @xcite found that the heating of the beam by the oblique instability eventually led to its suppression , allowing the two - stream instability to grow , continuing the dissipation of the beam kinetic energy . as a result , in their simulations",
    "a total of 30% of the energy was deposited into the background plasma via a _ combination _ of the oblique and two - stream instabilities , i.e. , an additional 10% of the beam energy was thermalized via the two - stream instability during and after the suppression of the oblique instability .    in our case",
    ", we expect that much more beam energy ( more than the 20% , and possibly up to @xmath164 ) will be deposited into the background igm because we are much deeper into the regime in which the oblique instability dominates , i.e. , @xmath143 and @xmath138 .",
    "in particular , for the case of interest here , @xmath165 and @xmath166 the extremely large lorentz factor and tiny density ratio make it computationally prohibitive to assess the beam evolution with numerical pic directly . nevertheless , because we find ourselves in a regime",
    "in which the oblique instability is much more strongly dominant than that simulated in @xcite , we expect the linear growth of the kinetic oblique instability to continue for much longer before the beam changes character and moves out of the oblique - dominated regime  potentially once @xmath167 of the beam energy has been dissipated .",
    "however , this remains to be studied in future work .",
    "the effect of nonlinear processes might also effect the evolution of the linear instability .",
    "for instance , @xcite argued that for the relativistic electrostatic two - stream instability , nonlinear coupling to daughter modes arrest the growth of the linearly unstable mode at a very low mode energy .",
    "hence , they claim that the electrostatic two - stream instability can only bleed energy from the beam at a slow rate .    utilizing the order of magnitude estimates in @xcite or the expression for nonlinear landau damping in @xcite",
    ", we have found that damping of the pair beam via the relativistic two - stream instability could be highly suppressed .",
    "the oblique instability may be similarly suppressed , however , this effect is much more marginal due to the instabilities much larger growth rate .",
    "nevertheless , determining its behavior for the parameters relevant here is an important unanswered question that is left for future work . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we will rely upon the intuition developed from numerical studies of the oblique instability and argue that the beam ends up heating the igm primarily .    in what follows , we will presume the nonlinear evolution of the `` oblique '' or related plasma instabilities lead to the heating of the background igm , i.e. , beam cooling .",
    "however , we note that the beam itself may be the primary recipient of this kinetic energy , i.e. , beam disruption .",
    "most of our results depend critically on beam cooling and not beam disruption .",
    "this includes the effect of blazar heating on the igm temperature - density relation studied in paper ii , the effects on structure formation studied in paper iii , the excellent reproduction of the statistical properties of the high - redshift forest found in @xcite , and the implications on the egrb and the redshift evolution of tev blazars studied in section [ sec : blf ] .",
    "however , our conclusions on the inapplicability of igmf constraints determined from the non - observation of gev emission from blazars still remains in the presence of beam disruption .",
    "this is because the self - scattering of pairs in the beam would suppress this gev emission in similar manner to an igmf .",
    "+      the beam instabilities we have discussed have been analyzed primarily within the context of unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "however , for a variety of theoretical reasons a weak igmf is not unexpected .",
    "for example , a field strength of @xmath47 is sufficient to explain the observed @xmath168 galactic fields via compression and winding alone .",
    "here we consider the implications that an igmf has for the instability growth rates we have described above .",
    "a strong igmf causes the ultra - relativistic pairs to gyrate , and therefore to isotropize , suppressing the growth of instabilities that feed upon the beam anisotropy ( e.g. , those we have described above ) .",
    "however , for this to efficiently quench the growth of the plasma beam instabilities , this isotropization must occur on a timescale comparable to the instability growth time , i.e. , the larmor frequency must be comparable to the cooling rate , @xmath109 .",
    "this condition gives a lower - limit upon igmf strengths sufficient to appreciably suppress the growth of plasma beam instabilities of @xmath169 considerably larger than those typical of both , primordial formation mechanisms @xcite and implied by galactic magnetic field estimates , assuming galactic fields are produced by contraction and winding alone .    because the vhegrs emitted by the tev blazars travel cosmological distances prior to producing pairs , an igmf capable of suppressing the plasma beam instabilities must necessarily have a volume filling fraction close to unity .",
    "in particular , it must permeate the low - density regions , where most of the cooling occurs .",
    "however , the alfvn velocity within those areas is extraordinarily small , roughly @xmath170 the igm sound speed , @xmath171 is considerably larger , implying convection is much more efficient .",
    "nevertheless , even after substantial heating via the thermalization of the tev blazar emission ( paper ii ) is taken into account , magnetic fields will have propagated @xmath172 over a hubble time via convection and much less via diffusion , implying that a pervasive , sufficiently strong magnetic field can not be produced via ejection from galactic dynamos .",
    "while galactic winds can produce much faster outflows , @xmath173 , unless they inject a mass comparable to that contained in the low - density regions over a hubble time , they are rapidly slowed via dissipation at shocks in the igm , again limiting the spread of galactic fields .",
    "moreover , we note that since the magnetic field must be volume filling to suppress the plasma beam cooling substantially it is insufficient to produce pockets of strong fields , and thus any galactic origin powered by winds requires a nearly complete reprocessing of the low - density regions",
    ". however , the ultimate thermalization of such fast , dense winds would raise the igm temperature to @xmath174 , in conflict with the forest data and exceeding the entire bolometric output of quasars by at least a factor of two .",
    "for these reasons we conclude that a volume - filling strong igmf would demand a primordial origin .",
    "the existence of plasma processes that can cool the pair beams associated with tev blazars has profound consequences for efforts to constrain the igmf using the spectra of tev blazars .",
    "here we describe how the reported igmf limits have been obtained , the consequences of plasma cooling for these , and potential strategies for overcoming the constraints it imposes .    the general argument made in efforts to constrain the igmf based upon the gev emission from blazars proceeds as follows : the beamed tev blazar emission pair - creates off of the ebl .",
    "the resulting pairs subsequently up - scatter cmb photons to gev energies . in principle",
    ", this should produce an observable gev excess , or bump , in the spectra of these objects .",
    "however , in the presence of a large - scale igmf , the ultra - relativistic pairs can be deflected significantly , directing the beamed gev emission away from earth .",
    "thus , it is argued , the lack of a discernible gev bump in a number of tev blazars implies a lower limit upon the igm field strength ( as a function of tev jet opening angle and variability timescale ) .",
    "the crucial components of the argument are    1 .",
    "the tev emission is beamed with the typical opening angles inferred from radio observations of agn jets . 2 .",

    "the icc is typically quenched , substantially limiting the contributions of these sources to the egrb .",
    "thus , even with a dramatically evolving blazar population , e.g. , similar to that of quasars , it is possible for these objects to be consistent with the egrb . while our discussion of the egrb and the evolution of blazars is predicated on the extraction of the pair - beam kinetic energy by plasma beam instabilities , our conclusions are not .",
    "rather they will continue to hold as long as the pair beams are locally dissipated  via plasma beam instabilities or some other equally powerful mechanism .",
    "blazars dominate the extragalactic gamma - ray sky , and thus represent the best studied vhegr source class .",

    "nevertheless , we will find that this is remarkably similar to the local quasar luminosity function ( @xmath225 ) , and thus attempt to construct a blazar luminosity function by analogy : @xmath226 in which @xmath227 is the comoving number density of blazars at redshifts less than @xmath56 with isotropic - equivalent luminosities below @xmath228 .",
    "this is different from previous efforts to empirically constrain @xmath229 from the egrb ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in at least two ways . first , we begin with an empirically determined local @xmath229 and attempt to extend this by placing the tev blazars within the broader context of accreting supermassive black holes , rather than beginning with the egrb and working backwards to infer an acceptable @xmath229 .",
    "second , we are primarily concerned with @xmath229 of tev blazars , and specifically do not consider the contributions from other kinds of objects . while this does not represent a significant oversight in terms of the high - energy contributions to the egrb , which almost certainly arises from the vhegr - emitting blazars , it does mean that our conclusions regarding the luminosity function of the tev blazars do not necessarily apply to all agn ( e.g. , the fsrqs , see below ) .",
    "the tev blazars presumably fit within the broader context of the blazars observed by specifically , and agns generally .",
    "for this reason , here we briefly review the physical classification scheme based on the widely accepted agn standard paradigm that provides a unified picture of the emission emission properties of these objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . specifically , we summarize the classes of objects believed to be capable of producing significant tev luminosities and the potential physical processes responsible for the observed emission . based upon these we then assess the implications for the number , variability , and redshift evolution of the tev blazars .",
    "in general there exist two main classes of agns that differ in their accretion mode and in the physical processes that dominate the emission .    1 .   _ thermal / disk - dominated agns : _ infalling matter assembles in a thin disk and radiates thermal emission with a range of temperatures",
    ". the distributed black - body emission is then comptonized by a hot corona above the disk that produces power - law x - ray emission .",
    "hence the emission is a measure of the accretion power of the central object .",
    "this class of objects are called qsos or seyfert galaxies and make up about 90% of agns .",
    "they preferentially emit in the optical or x - rays and do not show significant nuclear radio emission .",
    "none of these sources have so far been unambiguously detected by or imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes because the comptonizing electron population is not highly relativistic and emits isotropically , i.e. there is no beaming effect that boosts the emission .",
    "_ non - thermal / jet - dominated agns : _ the non - thermal emission from the radio to x - ray is synchrotron emission in a magnetic field by highly energetic electrons that have been accelerated in a jet of material ejected from the nucleus at relativistic speed .",
    "the same population of electrons can also compton up - scatter any seed photon population either provided by the synchrotron emission itself or from some other external radiation field such as uv radiation from the accretion disk .",
    "hence the sed of these objects shows two distinct peaks .",
    "the luminosity of these non - thermal emission components probes the jet power of these objects .",
    "observationally , this leads to the class of radio - loud agns which can furthermore be subdivided into blazars and non - aligned non - thermal dominated agns depending on the orientation of their jets with respect to the line of sight .",
    "there are no known sources above @xmath230 that correspond to agns with jets pointed at large angles ( @xmath231 , see @xcite ) with respect to the line of sight ( for an example of a non - aligned agn , ngc1275 , that shows a very steep high - energy spectrum , emitting a negligible number of vhegrs , see * ? ? ?",
    "hence we turn our attention to blazars , which can be powerful tev sources .",
    "blazars can further be subdivided into two main subclasses depending upon their optical spectral properties : flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacs .",
    "fsrqs , defined by broad optical emission lines , have seds that peak at energies below @xmath232 , implying a maximum particle energy within the jet and limiting the inverse - compton scattered photons mostly to the soft gamma - ray band .",
    "it is presumably for this reason that no continuous tev component has been detected in an fsrq ( note , however , that tev flares from fsrqs have been detected in two cases @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , bl lacs or blazars of the bl lac type @xcite can be copious tev emitters .",
    "these are very compact radio sources and have a broadband sed similar to that of strong lined blazars , though lack the broad emission lines that define those .",
    "depending upon the peak energy in the synchrotron spectrum , which approximately reflects the maximum particle energy within the jet , they are classified as intermediate- , or high - energy peaked bl lacs , respectively called lbl , ibl , and hbl @xcite . while lbls peak in the far - ir or ir band , they exhibit a flat or inverted x - ray spectrum due to the dominance of the inverse - compton component ( see fig 15 of * ? ? ? * for a visualization of the sed of bl lacs ) .",
    "the synchrotron component of ibls peaks in the optical which moves their inverse - compton peak into the gamma - ray band of .",
    "hbls are much more powerful particle accelerators , with the synchrotron peak reaching into the uv or , in some cases , the soft x - ray bands .",
    "the inverse - compton peak can then reach tev energies @xcite .    in the gamma - ray band ,",
    "the subclass of ibls that emit vhegrs are almost indistinguishable from the hbls , suggesting that the location of the synchrotron peak does not uniquely characterize the vhegr emission from these sources ( e.g. , due to variations among individual blazars in the magnetic field strength within the synchrotron emitting region and the origins and properties of the seed photons that are ultimately comptonized ) .",
    "hence we identify hbls and vhegr - emitting ibls with the single source class of tev blazars .",
    "we note that there is presently no evidence for the hypothetical class of ultra - hbls that were proposed to have a very energetic synchrotron component extending to @xmath92-rays @xcite .",
    "if such a population of bright and numerous sources exists , should have seen it @xcite .",
    "the ultra - hbls may have escaped detection from thus far by being either intrinsically dim @xmath92-ray sources or very rare objects @xcite .",
    "tev blazars have a redshift distribution that is peaked at low redshifts extending only up to @xmath233 .",
    "this is most likely entirely a flux selection effect ; tev blazars are intrinsically less luminous than lbls and fsrqs , with an observed isotropic - equivalent luminosity range of @xmath234 , with the highest redshift tev blazars also being among the most luminous objects ( see figures 23 and 24 in * ? ? ?",
    "that tev blazars should be intrinsically less luminous than fsrqs is not entirely unexpected , however .",
    "@xcite have argued that the physical distinction between fsrqs and tev blazars has its origin in the the different accretion regimes of the two classes of objects . using the gamma - ray luminosity as a proxy for the bolometric luminosity ,",
    "the boundary between the two subclasses of blazars can be associated with the accretion rate threshold ( nearly 1% of the eddington rate ) separating optically thick accretion disks with nearly eddington accretion rates from radiatively inefficient accretion flows .",
    "the spectral separation in hard ( bl lacs ) and soft ( fsrqs ) objects then results from the different radiative cooling suffered by the relativistic electrons in jets propagating into different surrounding media @xcite . hence in this model",
    ", tev blazars can not reach higher luminosities than approximately @xmath235 since they are limited by the nature of inefficient accretion flows that power these jets and by the maximum black hole mass , @xmath236 .       and @xmath237 , respectively ) .",

    "the dotted line shows the distance - dependence of the flux limit we employ in the completeness correction . ]    while we have attempted to place the observed tev blazars , which we have identified with the hbls and vhegr - emitting ibls , into the broader context of agns using the unified model , due to the substantial distinctions in accretion rate , emission properties , object morphology and geometry , it is not obvious that any of the properties of tev blazars should be similar to those of agns more generally .",
    "nevertheless , evidence for a simple connection between the two populations can be found in the similarity between their the luminosity functions ( a fact we will exploit later in estimating the redshift evolution of the tev blazars ) .",

    "we choose fiducial values for the spectral parameters of @xmath321 , @xmath311 , and @xmath290 , typical of the tev blazars ( see table [ tab : tevsources ] and * ? ? ?",
    "finally , since resolves individual gamma - ray blazars with isotropic - equivalent luminosities @xmath322 , roughly the location of the peak in @xmath229 , for @xmath323 , we construct the egrb from sources at larger redshift .",
    "if @xmath316 is sufficiently high ( @xmath324 ) the egrb is remarkably insensitive to the particular values of @xmath316 and @xmath254 ( see the bottom two panels of figure [ fig : egrb ] ) .",
    "this is a direct result of the annihilation of the vhegrs upon the ebl , effectively removing the relevant portion of the blazar sed from the egrb .",
    "more important is the low - energy spectral index .",
    "however , for values of @xmath325 that are consistent with the comptonization models for the vhegr emission , the anticipated egrb is consistent with the result .",
    "thus , we find that despite our dramatically evolving @xmath229 , we are are able to satisfy the limits imposed by the egrb . moreover , for reasonable spectral - parameter values",
    "it is possible to accurately reproduce both the magnitude and shape of the high - energy egrb ( i.e. , at energies @xmath326 ) .",
    "at first this may appear in conflict with other studies that have performed more sophisticated analyses of the gamma - ray emission from blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) that have typically found that such a strongly evolving @xmath229 over - produces the egrb .",
    "however , this is not the case for three reasons .",
    "first , the agn populations typically considered in computations of the egrb include the fsrqs and lbls , which dominate at low energies .",
    "the tev blazars of interest here are only the high - energy tail of the blazar distribution , and it is these alone that we fix to the quasar luminosity function ( indeed , it is for only these objects that the arguments surrounding figure [ fig : blf ] have been made ) .",
    "moreover , the tev blazars themselves are generally dimmer , both bolometrically and within the lat energy band ( @xmath48@xmath49 ) , than the lbls and fsrqs , which have typical isotropic - equivalent luminosities of @xmath327 @xcite .",
    "second , and perhaps most importantly , the suppression of the iccs means that the vhegr emission is lost to heat in the igm , not reprocessed to below @xmath49 .",
    "since the tev blazar flux is presumed to be dominated by emission above @xmath49 , the non - radiative dissipation of this emission substantially reduces the impact of the tev blazars upon the egrb . for all of the spectral parameters we considered the un - absorbed fluxes",
    "exceed the @xmath328 egrb by a significant margin , implying that the suppression of the iccs is crucial to bringing the tev blazar contributions in line with the egrb .",
    "thus , the lack of the iccs generally appears necessary to reconcile the blazar and quasar luminosity functions .",
    "third , the vhegr spectra from the most luminous tev blazars necessarily peaks near or above tev energies . for a number of the sources in table [ tab : tevsources ] , the intrinsic vhegr spectrum ( adjusted for annihilation on the ebl ) is inverted , indicating that this break is _ above _ a tev .",
    "the brightest tev blazar in table [ tab : tevsources ] , mkn 421 , has an inverted spectrum below @xmath49 @xcite , implying @xmath329 .",
    "the second brightest , 1es 1959 + 650 , is consistent with being flat below @xmath49 , and appears to peak near @xmath133 when in the high - state @xcite .",
    "similarly , 1es 2344 + 514 peaks near @xmath330 @xcite and mkn 501 is inverted below @xmath49 , implying a peak above that value @xcite . thus the sources likely to dominate the vhegr background , and by extension the egrb , all turn over near @xmath49@xmath133 .",
    "this is expected if the the vhegr emission arises from inverse - compton scattering the synchrotron bump ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the consequence of the spectral break is the suppression of the contribution from the tev blazars to the egrb below @xmath316 .",
    "were the tev blazar contribution to the egrb dominated by sources with @xmath331 it would exceed the egrb at @xmath332 .",
    "a more complete analysis of the egrb should include a variety of spectra , including a distribution of break energies , smoothly connecting the hbl , ibl and lbl populations .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of this paper , which is primarily concerned with the fate of the vhegr emission , absent in the lbls and fsrqs .",
    "nevertheless a recent comprehensive model , which includes the contributions of the fsrqs and bl lacs observed by , as well as starburst galaxies , has had considerable success fitting the egrb with an even more extremely evolving @xmath229 ; fixing it to the luminosity function of radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance here is that @xcite and @xcite explicitly ignored the potential contributions of iccs . unlike their analysis",
    ", however , we find that the tev blazars are capable of reaching the highest bands despite the annihilation upon the ebl .",
    "the cold , highly anisotropic beams of ultra - relativistic @xmath63 pairs produced by the annihilation of vhegrs upon the ebl are unstable to plasma beam instabilities",
    ". more importantly , for a wide range of parameters relevant for the observed tev blazars these instabilities may be capable of isotropizing , and potentially extracting the kinetic energy of , the pairs at a rate orders of magnitude faster than inverse - compton scattering .",
    "this has far reaching consequences for efforts to constrain the igmf using empirical limits upon the gev emission from known tev sources .",
    "typically , @xmath333 after the onset of tev emission the pair beam density has grown sufficiently for plasma beam instabilities to dominate its evolution , randomize the beam , and potentially suppress the inverse - compton signal upon which the igmf limits are based .",
    "note that due to the beam disruption by the instabilities , this occurs even if the plasma instabilities do not ultimately cool the pairs . as a consequence ,",
    "the present constraints upon the igmf , obtained by the non - observation of an inverse - compton gev bump in the spectra of bright tev blazars are inherently unreliable .",
    "nevertheless , the sudden appearance of a tev - bright blazar or intrinsically transient sources ( e.g. , grbs ) provide a means to temporarily avoid the consequences of plasma beam instabilities during the growth of the pair beam .",
    "alternatively , observing particularly dim sources , @xmath334 , limits the beam density directly , again avoiding the complications imposed by plasma processes .",
    "finally , the presence of these plasma instabilities in the pair beams of tev blazars , which manifest themselves through their impact on the igm ( see paper ii , paper iii , and @xcite ) , implies the most stringent upper limit to date on the igmf : @xmath222 .",
    "if the plasma instabilities can efficiently convert the pair beam kinetic energy into heat in the igm , as we anticipate based upon existing numerical simulations and the arguments in section [ sec : nls ] , they would necessarily suppress the development of iccs , and thus prevent the reprocessing of the vhegr emission from bright sources to gev energies .",
    "the lack of iccs , independent of the mechanism that facilitates the local dissipation of the pair kinetic energy , would greatly weaken the constraints upon the evolution of the blazar population derived from the unresolved egrb measured by . by introducing a spectral break near @xmath133 and eliminating the reprocessed vhegr emission , we find that the egrb is consistent with a tev blazar ( and therefore presumably hard gamma - ray blazar ) luminosity function fixed to that of quasars , normalized by comparing objects in the local universe ( @xmath45 ) , and motivated by the remarkable similarity between them in the local universe .",
    "this conclusion is relatively insensitive to the particular parameters governing the vhegr spectra of the tev blazars , requiring only that the vhegr emission is produced via inverse - compton scattering . for a wide range of spectral parameters ,",
    "we are able to match the magnitude and shape of the egrb at high energies , with the low - energy component presumably arising from the fsrqs and lbls .",
    "this @xmath229 , and perhaps an even more rapidly evolving luminosity function , is also consistent with the observed redshift distribution of the 1lac hsp and hard - isp sample .",
    "matching the high - energy egrb ( above @xmath335 ) requires more tev blazars than are currently observed , though a comparable number to those inferred once the sky - coverage and gev duty - cycle completeness corrections are included . based upon these factors , and our rough estimate of the egrb",
    ", we predict that upcoming surveys performed with next - generation cerenkov telescope arrays ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should find roughly @xmath336 sources above @xmath337 ( our estimate of the effective flux limit of current imaging cerenkov telescopes ) , and a handful of additional sources comparable to the brightest tev blazars observed .",
    "in addition , based upon the current number of known tev blazars and our estimate of @xmath274 , the improved anticipated sensitivities of these instruments , @xmath338@xmath339 time larger than current arrays , should result in the detection of @xmath340@xmath341 additional tev blazars , with median luminosities @xmath342 .",
    "these should allow more precise estimates for their gamma - ray seds and a better characterization of @xmath274 , especially for low - luminosity objects .",
    "unlike inverse - compton cooling , the plasma beam instabilities deposit the energy locally , heating the igm .",
    "moreover , the homogeneity of the ebl , and the weak dependence of the plasma cooling rates upon the igm density , result in a uniform _ volumetric _ heating , in clear contrast to either photoionization heating or mechanical feedback from agn . while we shall defer a detailed discussion of the consequences of this heating to papers ii , iii , and",
    "@xcite here we note that this unusual heating prescription naturally explains a number of heretofore outstanding questions , including the inverted equation - of - state ( temperature - density relation ) for low density regions in the igm ( paper ii ) , the suppression of dwarf galaxies and their histories , the segregation of galaxy clusters and groups into cool core and non - cool core populations ( paper iii ) , and the quantitative properties of the high - redshift forest @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "despite the fact that our estimates of the plasma cooling rates are limited to the linear regime ( though with some numerical support ) , there are a variety of observational reasons to believe that plasma cooling , or an analogous mechanism , does in fact dominate the evolution of the ultra - relativistic pair beams .",

    "thus , we adopt the simpler explanation : the hsps with unknown redshifts have and sid and fd similar to low-@xmath56 objects because they are intrinsically dim , nearby objects .                                                                                                                                                                                  , m. , et  al . 2010 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",

    "<S> the absence of this emission from bright tev blazars has been used to constrain the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) , and the stringent limits placed upon the unresolved extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egrb ) by has been used to argue against a large number of such objects at high redshifts . however , these are predicated upon the assumption that inverse - compton scattering is the primary energy - loss mechanism for the ultra - relativistic pairs produced by the annihilation of the energetic gamma rays on extragalactic background light photons . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that for sufficiently bright tev sources ( isotropic - equivalent luminosities @xmath1 ) plasma beam instabilities , specifically the `` oblique '' instability , present a plausible mechanism by which the energy of these pairs can be dissipated locally , heating the intergalactic medium . </S>",
    "<S> since these instabilities typically grow on timescales short in comparison to the inverse - compton cooling rate , they necessarily suppress the inverse - compton cascades . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> this places a severe constraint upon efforts to limit the igmf from the lack of a discernible gev bump in tev sources . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , it considerably weakens the limits upon the evolution of blazar populations . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we construct a tev - blazar luminosity function from those objects presently observed and find that it is very well described by the quasar luminosity function at @xmath2 , shifted to lower luminosities and number densities , suggesting that both classes of sources are regulated by similar processes . extending this relationship to higher redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the magnitude and shape of the egrb above @xmath3 is naturally reproduced with this particular example of a rapidly evolving tev - blazar luminosity function . </S>"
