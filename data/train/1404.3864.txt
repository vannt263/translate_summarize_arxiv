    "it is known @xcite that in the old days in the 1950s , l.d .",
    "landau expressed the point of view that the most important problems of theoretical physics were superconductivity , phase transitions and the cosmological singularity .",
    "today everyone knows that decisive successes have been achieved in the explanation of the phenomena of superconductivity ( j. bardeen , l. cooper and j. schrieffer , 1957 ) and phase transitions ( k. wilson , 1974 ) .",
    "we note with satisfaction that during the last fifty years due to international efforts , our understanding of the problem of the cosmological singularity has also reached a deep and sound maturity and it was l.d .",
    "landau himself we have to thank for the initial spark at the beginning of this impressive development .",
    "the phenomenon of singularities was born in 1922 when a. friedmann published his famous cosmological solution for the homogeneous and isotropic universe . however , from that time through the late fifties researchers devoted their attention mainly to the physical processes occurring after the big bang and there were no serious attempts to rigorously analyze the very phenomenon of the singularity itself . around the end of 1950s",
    "landau formulated the crucial question of whether the cosmological singularity is a generic phenomenon of general relativity or if it appears only in particular solutions under special symmetry conditions .",
    "he also proposed a way to approach this problem mathematically . for any system of differential equations",
    "one can define the notion of its general solution which describes the development of arbitrary initial data , that is , data which is not subject to any special restrictions .",
    "such a solution should contain a complete set of the arbitrary functional parameters by which one can specify any possible initial state of the system .",
    "for the gravitational field in vacuum this number is 4 , see ref .  .",
    "of course , due to their mathematical complexity there is no way to analytically construct the general solution of the gravitational field equations but for the problem of interest this is not necessary",
    ". it would be enough to find the most general asymptotic expansion of the solution in the vicinity to the singularity and to count the number of arbitrary functional parameters it contains .",
    "if such asymptotics containing 4 arbitrary 3-dimensional functions can be found , then this will be the proof that a general solution with a cosmological singularity exists . without loss of generality we can choose the synchronous reference system where @xmath0 is positive definite .",
    "we use greek letters for space - like tensorial indices and latin letters in round brackets for the corresponding frame indices .",
    "ordinary partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates @xmath1 we designate by a comma and the ordinary partial derivative with respect to the synchronous time @xmath2 we denote by a dot .",
    "we use units in which the einstein gravitational constant and the velocity of light are equal to unity . ] which is most suitable for cosmological applications of general relativity and consider the singular space - like hypersurface ( assuming its existence ) having equation @xmath3 . then for each possible type of expansion of the metric tensor with respect to the infinitesimally small values of time variable , one can perform the analysis in accordance with landau s prescription .",
    "of course , this program entails the knowledge in advance of all possible characters of the expansion of the metric in the vicinity to the singularity . at the time when these ideas appeared ,",
    "only singularities with power law asymptotics for the scale factors were known and the detailed study of all such cases was performed by e.m .",
    "lifschitz and i.m .",
    "khalatnikov during the years 19591962 .",
    "they collected and published their results in 1963 in the comprehensive review of ref .  .",
    "they showed that any solution of the einstein equations ( in vacuum or in a space filled with a perfect fluid ) with a cosmological singularity having power law asymptotics could not be general .",
    "each solution of this type is unstable in the sense that if one approaches the singularity , any power law regime sooner or later will be destroyed under the influence of arbitrary perturbations . in vacuum",
    "the most general solution with a power law singularity contains only 3 arbitrary functional parameters instead of the 4 which are necessary for the solution to be general .",
    "they named this solution with three arbitrary degrees of freedom the _ generalized kasner solution _ since it represents the inhomogeneous generalization of the well - known kasner metric ( the vacuum anisotropic homogeneous cosmological model of bianchi type i ) . in the synchronous reference system this solution describes the anisotropic expansion or contraction of the 3-dimensional space along three different directions @xmath4 ( kasner axes ) with three different scale factors @xmath5 corresponding to these directions .",
    "the first order terms of the generalized kasner solution near the singularity @xmath3 are @xmath6@xmath7 where the exponents @xmath8 and vectors @xmath9 depend only on three - dimensional space coordinates @xmath1 . the generalized kasner exponents @xmath8 have to satisfy two relations : @xmath10 this approximation comes from gravitational field equations @xmath11 and @xmath12 when one only keeps terms with time derivatives in them , neglecting all terms containing spatial derivatives ( the equations @xmath13 are of no interest since they only put three constraints on the arbitrary 3-dimensional functions @xmath14 and play no role in the dynamics ) . from the relations ( [ or2 ] ) it follows that one of the exponents is negative and other two are positive .",
    "consequently , when one approaches the singularity @xmath15 the 3-dimensional space expands in one direction and contracts in two others .    without loss of generality we can choose @xmath16 to be negative and in this case the generalized kasner asymptotics will be valid up to the singularity if and only if the vector @xmath17 ( namely that one corresponding to the direction of unlimited expansion near the singularity ) is subject to the following additional constraint ( additional with respect to the 3 natural constraints following from the equations @xmath13):@xmath18=0,\\label{or3}\\ ] ] where the vectors @xmath19 are inverse to the @xmath20 that is @xmath21 and @xmath22 this condition comes from the fact that without it the kasner dynamics with @xmath23 ceases to be valid in the limit @xmath15 because the terms of the next approximation to the metric tensor ( [ or1])([or2 ] ) instead of being negligible diverge relative to the terms of first order",
    "this divergence is due the influence of those terms in the equations @xmath12 which contain the quantity @xmath24 $ ] and its space derivatives . then if this quantity does not vanish , the original assumption of the dominating role of the time derivative terms is violated . however , it turns out that all these divergences can be removed by only one additional constraint * ( [ or3])*. after that all higher order corrections to the generalized kasner asymptotics near the singularity will be infinitesimally small , which justifies the validity of the approximation ( [ or1])([or2 ] ) .",
    "all these higher order corrections can be calculated from the einstein equations in a unique way and they do not contain any new arbitrary 3-dimensional functions apart from those already presented in the solution of the first approximation .    the qualitative character of the generalized kasner solution remains the same also in the presence of a perfect fluid with any equation of state except the stiff matter @xmath25 case ( for this special zeldovich type of equation of state see below ) .",
    "the presence of a perfect fluid does not change the character of the leading asymptotics ( [ or1])([or2 ] ) of the solution and matter can be  inserted \" in the solution together with its 4 additional arbitrary three dimensional functions ( one for the energy density and three for the velocity ) .",
    "consequently their work @xcite showed that the most general cosmological solution ( for vacuum and standard perfect fluid cases ) with power law asymptotics has one degree of freedom less with respect to the general solution and the additional condition ( [ or3 ] ) is responsible for this .    of course",
    ", from this result one can not draw any conclusion about the existence or non - existence of a general solution with a singularity .",
    "it only means that the general solution can not have a singularity of power law character , but this does not exclude the possibility that a general solution with a singularity of some different yet unknown type does exist .",
    "the natural way to try to resolve the problem was to look at what will happen to the generalized kasner solution after ( towards the singularity @xmath15 ) the terms in the gravitational equations containing the non - zero quantity @xmath26 $ ] begin to destroy the kasner regime . in physics",
    "the missions of this kind usually are highly non - trivial but in general relativity , in spite of the complexity of the einstein equations , the final fate of the gravitational field near a singularity can be described almost completely .",
    "this was done mainly during 19631968 by v. belinski , i. khalatnikov and e. lifshitz ( bkl ) who showed that after removing the artificial additional condition ( [ or3 ] ) the solution develops to the _ generic _ solution of the gravitational field equations possessing a real curvature singularity of an essentially new type of chaotic oscillatory character instead of a smooth power law behavior .",
    "the detailed exposition of the bkl results can be found in their basic articles @xcite and in two review papers @xcite .    in order to avoid misunderstandings",
    "let s stress that by a cosmological singularity we mean a singularity in time , where the singular manifold is space - like , and the curvature invariants together with the invariant characteristics of any matter fields ( like energy density ) diverge on this manifold . in 1965",
    "roger penrose @xcite proved an important theorem , saying that under some conditions the appearance of incomplete geodesics in space - time is unavoidable .",
    "this is also a singularity but of a different type since , in general , incompleteness does not means that invariants diverge .",
    "in addition the theorem can say nothing about the analytical structure of the fields near the points where geodesics terminate .",
    "thus penrose s result was not of any direct help for us , nevertheless it stimulated our search .",
    "in any case it is true to say that the bkl approach and the penrose theorem elucidates two sides of the phenomenon but the links between them are still far from understood .",
    "this is because the bkl approach studies the asymptotics in the vicinity of the the singularity and penrose s theorem has to do with global properties of the space - time .    following idea of the bkl analysis",
    "one should include in the equations of the main approximation not only the time derivatives but also those spatial gradients which are responsible for the instability of the kasner dynamics near the singularity .",
    "if one approaches the singularity starting with the metric ( [ or1])([or2 ] ) with @xmath23 then it is necessary to take into account first of all those terms in the equations which are present due to the non - zero quantity @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the influence of these terms can be clarified exactly and result shows that their action transforms the initial kasner regime again to another kasner regime but with new 3-dimensional functional parameters @xmath27 these new parameters can be expressed uniquely in terms of their initial values @xmath28 the crucial point is that the new exponents @xmath29 still satisfy the same kasner relations ( [ or2 ] ) and one of them again will be negative and two others positive . if initially we started with the asymptotics ( [ or1])([or2 ] ) with @xmath23 then at the new _ kasner _ _ epoch _ the negative exponent jumps from the scale factor @xmath30 to the scale factor @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( to that one which had the smallest of two positive kasner exponents at the initial epoch ) .",
    "namely @xmath30 in fact does not diverge as @xmath15 but at some critical time reaches a maximum and then starts to decrease while one of the factors @xmath31 or @xmath32 starts to increase instead .",
    "exactly what happens is the following .",
    "if we start the initial kasner epoch with @xmath33 ( i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath34 ) by the asymptotics@xmath35 then after the aforementioned critical time the asymptotics of the scale factors changes to@xmath36   } { 1 + 2p_{\\left (   1\\right )   } } } , \\text { } c^{2}=\\tilde{c}_{0}^{2}\\,t^{\\frac{2\\left [   p_{\\left (   3\\right ) } + 2p_{\\left (   1\\right )   } \\right ]   } { 1 + 2p_{\\left (   1\\right )   } } } , \\label{or5}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 are the arbitrary 3-dimensional functions and three new functional parameters @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 are expressed in terms of @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath43 @xmath8 and quantity @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "now @xmath31 increases because @xmath44    this means that in the general case when initially all three quantities @xmath45,\\text { } \\mu = l_{(3)}^{\\mu}l_{(1)}^{\\nu}[l_{\\mu,\\nu}^{(2)}-l_{\\nu,\\mu}^{(2)}],\\text { } \\nu = l_{(1)}^{\\mu}l_{(2)}^{\\nu}[l_{\\mu,\\nu}^{(3)}-l_{\\nu,\\mu}^{(3)}]\\label{or3 - 1}\\ ] ] are non - zero , at the second kasner epoch the system will find itself qualitatively in the same state as before and the new transition of the same kind to the third kasner epoch will take place and so on .",
    "this process of the changing of kasner epochs produces oscillations of the scale factors .",
    "the bkl analysis shows that these oscillations never terminate up to the singular point @xmath3 which is the point of their condensation . in synchronous time the frequencies of these oscillations",
    "tend to infinity and the number of epochs between any instant @xmath46 and singularity @xmath3 is infinite .",
    "the duration of these epochs tends to zero and transitions between them take a very short time compared to their durations .",
    "when one approaches the singularity the values of all the scale factors , although oscillating , tend to zero because their successive maxima tend to zero .",
    "the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath0 tends to zero monotonically and all invariants of the riemann tensor diverge at the point @xmath47 the solution of this type is structurally stable and generic since it is free of any additional constraints on its 3-dimensional parameters apart of those natural ones which are dictated by the conventional initial conditions for the gravitational field equations .",
    "this singularity is essentially of a new type with respect to all those previously known because no power law behavior can be ascribed to it .",
    "moreover , in the asymptotic vicinity of the singularity @xmath15 this oscillatory regime becomes stochastic .",
    "to see the stochasticity of the oscillatory cosmological singularity let s mention first that bkl showed that in the course of approaching the singular point @xmath3 , alternating kasner epochs are grouped into successive series called _ eras .",
    "_ during each era two of the scale factors oscillate and the third one monotonically decreases . at each new era",
    "one of the factors which in a preceding era was oscillating starts to decrease monotonically and other two start to oscillate against each other and so on . from epoch to epoch inside each era the kasner exponents change their places relative to the kasner directions and change their numerical values .",
    "it is important that at each new epoch the new exponents @xmath29 are simple elementary functions on their previous values @xmath8 only , that is @xmath29 do not depend on the old and new directional vectors of the kasner axis .",
    "this means that the whole evolution of the numerical values of kasner exponents can be described by the one - dimensional map since due to the relations ( [ or2 ] ) all three exponents can be expressed in terms of only one free parameter .",
    "let s look on the evolution of the numerical values of the exponents ignoring the question to which direction of the 3-dimensional space we should relate that or another exponent at each kasner epoch . to do this",
    "it is convenient to introduce the ordered set @xmath48 of three kasner exponents by the following parametric representation ( which automatically meets the requirements ( [ or2 ] ) ) : @xmath49 where the functional parameter @xmath50 takes values in the region @xmath51 the exponents appearing in the metric ( [ or1 ] ) for each kasner epoch follow from this ordered set by permutations .",
    "it turns out that if we start the evolution towards the singularity with some initial value of parameter @xmath52 then the evolution of the numerical values of the exponents ( [ or3 - 2 ] ) at the first era corresponds to the sequence @xmath53(this can be derived from the law ( [ or4])([or5 ] ) governing the change of kasner exponents ) .",
    "because the range of parameter @xmath54 is fixed to be greater than unity we can follow such a sequence up to the value @xmath55 + 1 $ ] , where @xmath56 $ ] means the integer value of @xmath57 the last kasner epoch of the first era corresponds to the parameter @xmath55 + 1=1+x^{(1)}$ ] where @xmath58 and after this a new era should start with a new initial epoch corresponding to the parameter @xmath54 which would be equal to @xmath59 following the rule @xmath60 . however , the representation ( [ or3 - 2 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath61 ( plus permutations of the positive exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 but , as we stressed already , we are doing analysis ignoring any permutations of the exponents ) . due to this freedom",
    "we can arrange the initial parameter @xmath64 on the first epoch of the new era again to be greater then unity performing transformation @xmath65 now the evolution of kasner exponents during the second era can be described by the same sequence @xmath66 up until the final epoch in this second era when the parameter @xmath54 will be reduced to the value @xmath67   $ ] @xmath68 with @xmath69 and so on .",
    "it is easy to see that in the heart of this infinite process lie the one - dimensional discrete map @xmath70 where curly brackets mean the fractional part of a number and by the index @xmath71 we enumerate the eras .",
    "the number @xmath72 from the interval @xmath73 represents the fractional part of the value @xmath74 of the parameter @xmath54 at the first kasner epoch of the era with numerical index @xmath75 .",
    "mathematicians had studied this map ( [ or3 - 3 ] ) long ago and it was known to be stochastic in the sense that in the limit @xmath76 , any initial probability distribution @xmath77 for the variable @xmath78 ( no matter how sharp ) will develop into the stationary ( invariant ) distribution @xmath79 independent of the initial data .",
    "this is characteristic of strong stochasticity .",
    "this limiting stationary distribution ( normalized in the interval @xmath73 ) is:@xmath80    the map ( [ or3 - 3 ] ) had been introduced and analyzed by carl f. gauss around 200 years ago in his study of number theory and continued fractions .",
    "he also obtained the distribution ( [ or3 - 4 ] ) but never published its derivation @xcite . a rigorous derivation ( relatively complicated )",
    "was constructed only in 1928 by the russian mathematician r.o .",
    "kuzmin @xcite and in contemporary literature this result is often cited as the gauss - kuzmin theorem .",
    "the fact that the gauss map ( [ or3 - 3 ] ) is the source of stochasticity in the cosmological oscillatory regime near a singularity was first pointed out in ref .  .",
    "in this paper the statistical distributions and mean values for other characteristics of the regime were also found and a way was proposed to interpret them ( the question of physical interpretation is important because distributions which follow from the gauss - kuzmin formula ( [ or3 - 4 ] ) are unstable , namely fluctuations around mean values are not small ) .    after the discussion of the stochasticity of the oscillatory regime in @xcite",
    ", a vast literature appeared dedicated to the further development of the theory of chaos near the cosmological singularity .",
    "the principal steps of this development ( in chronological order ) are the following .    in 1972",
    "d. chitre @xcite established that the spatially homogenous bianchi type ix system of ordinary differential equations following from the vacuum einstein equations is equivalent to a billiard on the lobachevsky plane .",
    "it is well known that this kind of system has stochastic properties ( see the next section  cosmological billiard \" ) .    in 1973 appeared important results of o. bogoyavlenskii and s. novikov @xcite who , using the qualitative theory of differential equations ( the theory of dynamical systems ) , discovered the existence in the bianchi ix phase space of an attractor consisting of a dense set of periodic trajectories .",
    "today we know that this is one of the characteristic features of the strange attractor signifying the presence of chaos .",
    "this approach has an impressive contemporary continuation ( technically quite different ) in the work of refs .  .",
    "in 1982 j. barrow @xcite showed that one can attribute positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy to the stochastic evolution of the parameter @xmath54 of eq .",
    "( [ or3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "he calculated this entropy and proved that it is not zero .",
    "since the kolmogorov - sinai entropy can be defined as the sum of the positive lyapunov indices , his result means that at least one of these indices is positive , but this is enough for the appearance of stochasticity .    in 1983",
    "d. chernoff and j. barrow @xcite studied the stochastization of the bianchi type ix model in general ( not only for parameter @xmath54 ) .",
    "they considered the complete set of bianchi ix phase space variables ( scale factors @xmath81 and its first derivatives @xmath82 ) and separated the non - stochastic monotonous degrees of freedom ( like the determinant of the metric tensor ) from those two ( namely the parameter @xmath54 and ratio @xmath83 ) which are stochastic .",
    "for these two they obtained a two - dimensional stochastic map which can be reduced to the already known baker map , containing kolmogorov - sinai and topological entropy , ergodicity and mixing .",
    "for this two - dimensional map they also found the asymptotic stationary distribution .    in 1985 i.m .",
    "khalatnikov , e.m .",
    "lifshitz , ya.g .",
    "sinai , k.m .",
    "khanin and l.n .",
    "shchur @xcite completed the construction of the statistical theory of the bianchi type ix oscillatory regime , the basics of which had been worked out in ref .  , but those early results ( first of all the stable distributions for the scale factors @xmath5 and their stable mean values ) had been obtained with the help of some approximations , the validity of which was not evident at first glance . in ref .",
    "the confirmation of the validity of these approximations and construction of the corresponding exact approach was given .",
    "then a long period ( 19881995 ) of debate followed during which various authors ( for a review see the book ref .  ) expressed doubts about the statement that bianchi type ix dynamics is really chaotic . at that time",
    "some authors even expressed their opinion that the bianchi type ix model might be an integrable system .",
    "such a conjecture was erroneous , of course .",
    "the discussion had its origin in the fact that the lyapunov indices are not invariant under the time reparametrization .",
    "nonetheless some authors indicated a way to overcome this difficulty by defining these indices in a generally covariant way ( for example , see refs .  ) .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this problem turns out not to be so significant for the essence of the phenomenon .",
    "in fact lyapunov indices are not an appropriate instrument in general relativity but this does not mean that one can not identify a chaotic regime because many other of its symptoms can be found .",
    "the best demonstration of the truth of the last statement is the work of n. cornish and j. levin @xcite published in 1997 .",
    "this was the final persuasive confirmation of the chaoticity of the bianchi type ix dynamics .",
    "the authors used the two - dimensional chernoff - barrow map and showed the existence of an attractor of fractal dimensionality , i.e. , the strange attractor ( the same attractor which had been indicated by o. bogoiavlenskii and s. novikov , but the latter authors at that time had not yet qualified it as a fractal set ) .",
    "n. cornish and j. levin also calculated the topological entropy , constructed a symbolic dynamics ( codification of the trajectories by the words and phrases of an alphabet ) and showed that the discrete map they used represents a valid approximation for the actual continuous evolution .",
    "another efficient way to describe the oscillations near a cosmological singularity as well as their stochastic character comes from the construction of the so - called cosmological billiard @xcite . from the previous sections it follows that the oscillatory regime arises in the first instance due to the non - zero values of the quantities @xmath84 of eq .",
    "( [ or3 - 1 ] ) , namely to the @xmath85 components of the quantities @xmath86 $ ] . then to clarify the basic properties of this regime it will be useful to study simplified cosmological models with the metric ( [ or1 ] ) for which all three parameters @xmath84 are non - zero constants and the scale factors @xmath5 are functions depending only on time . moreover all of the other six quantities @xmath86 $ ] ( apart of @xmath84 ) we can set to zero since they do not play any notable role in creating the oscillations .",
    "it is a nontrivial fact that such exact models indeed exist .",
    "these are the so - called diagonal homogeneous cosmological models of bianchi types ix and viii ( diagonality means that the projections @xmath87 of the metric tensor onto the frame of the kasner directional vectors form the diagonal matrix with respect to the frame indices ) and the constant parameters @xmath88 $ ] are nothing else but the structural constants of the corresponding isometry group . the oscillatory cosmological regime had been discovered with the help of these models in ref .  .",
    "if instead of the scale factors @xmath5 we introduce the new variables @xmath89 in accordance with notations:@xmath90 and instead of the synchronous time @xmath91 the new time variable @xmath92 by the relation : @xmath93 then it is easy to show that the einstein equations for the aforementioned bianchi models in vacuum follow from the lagrangian:@xmath94 where the kinetic energy `` @xmath95 and potential energy '' @xmath96 are@xmath97@xmath98 here @xmath89 and @xmath99 are considered to be generalized coordinates and generalized velocities . apart from the three differential equations of second order for @xmath100 which follow from this lagrangian and which reproduce the diagonal components of the equations @xmath12 ( the non - diagonal components of @xmath101 are identically zero ) ,",
    "there is the well - known additional constraint@xmath102 which is equivalent to the equation @xmath11 ( the equations @xmath103 for these models are satisfied identically ) .",
    "these are the exact einstein equations for the diagonal models of ix and viii types in empty space .",
    "it is easy to prove that in the asymptotic vicinity of the singularity , only the first three terms in the potential ( [ or3 - 9 ] ) survive , namely that in the main approximation we have:@xmath104 this is because the products @xmath105 in the limit @xmath15 behave as @xmath106 for @xmath107 and they monotonically tend to zero due to the positiveness of all three sums of kasner exponents @xmath108 for @xmath107 .",
    "the quantities @xmath84 entering the potential are the arbitrary constants but without loss of generality one can take @xmath109 for type ix and @xmath110 @xmath111 for type viii . however , since the potential in the main approximation contains these constants only in squares there is no difference in the asymptotic dynamics of the models of types viii and ix .    owing to this lagrangian representation",
    "the asymptotic evolution of the scale factors can be described as a motion of a particle in the external potential @xmath96 .",
    "the earlier mentioned  dangerous \" space gradients which are responsible for the instability of the kasner dynamics are represented here by constants @xmath84 and the terms containing them create the reflecting potential s walls responsible for the oscillatory regime . for the case of the diagonal homogeneous cosmological model of the bianchi ix type",
    "an effective potential was introduced by c. misner and d. chitre @xcite .",
    "however , there is an essential difference between the misner - chitre approach and the contemporary point of view of this mechanical analogy .",
    "the subtlety is that the kinetic energy ( [ or3 - 8 ] ) is an indefinite quadratic form with respect to the velocities . to construct a system similar to a standard mechanical one ,",
    "it is necessary to find a way to single out those degrees of freedom corresponding to a positive - definite kinetic energy form and then include all other variables in the effective external potential .",
    "this method was used in the misner - chitre construction .",
    "however , such an effective external potential and its reflecting walls unavoidably evolve in time which produces undesirable complications ( especially for the succeeding analysis of the general inhomogeneous gravitational field and its multidimensional generalization ) .",
    "the present - day point of view was born around fifteen years ago in the work of t. damour , m. henneaux and h. nicolai ( dhn)@xcite and according to them the kinetic energy term ( [ or3 - 8 ] ) should be taken exactly as it stands , that is one should deal with the mechanics of the indefinite form of the kinetic energy in the space of the minkowski signature covered by the coordinates @xmath89 . in this case in the vicinity of the singularity the potential and its reflecting walls remain stationary which makes the analysis of their influence and their geometrical structure much more transparent . surprisingly enough",
    "this generalization of the mechanical analogy turned out to be not only a technical facilitation",
    "but it led directly to the discovery of the intriguing connection between the asymptotic oscillatory regime and infinite - dimensional kac - moody algebras .",
    "this is the consequence of the known mathematical fact that the root vectors of these algebras are living in a space of minkowski signature ( unlike the root vectors of the classical finite - dimensional lie algebras which have to be built in euclidian space ) and of that dhn observation that near the singularity all dihedral angles between the reflecting walls acquire exactly those distinguished values necessary for the vectors orthogonal to the walls to form the set of simple roots of a kac - moody algebra .    it easy to see that the kinetic term ( [ or3 - 8 ] ) corresponds to the motion of a particle in the flat 3-dimensional @xmath112-space ( with coordinates @xmath89 ) of minkowski signature ) after the linear coordinate transformation @xmath113",

    "the appearance of these algebras might signify the nontrivial huge symmetry hidden in the asymptotic structure of space - time near the cosmological singularity , a symmetry which neverltheless coexists with chaoticity . as of now we have no understanding where and how exactly this symmetry would act ( it could be as a continuous infinite - dimensional symmetry group of the exact lagrangian permitting the transformation of the given solutions of the equations of motion to the new solutions ) . if true the hidden symmetry conjecture could create new inestimable perspectives for the development of relativistic gravity and superstring theories .",
    "in the two previous sections we focused attention on the behavior of the scale factors with respect to stationary kasner axes . although this was very useful for understanding some basic properties of the oscillatory regime such an approach is insufficient for the description of the most general behavior of the metric tensor near a cosmological singularity .",
    "the point is that in the course of each kasner epoch these axes remain stationary but from epoch to epoch ( mainly during the short transition period between the epochs ) they change their directions .",
    "we call this evolution the _ rotation of the kasner axes _ and this effect has been described in ref .  .",
    "we emphasize again that the laws governing the evolution of the numerical values of the kasner exponents ( described in our second section ) do not depend on how kasner axes change their directions from epoch to epoch and that this invariance makes the behavior of kasner exponents a particularly important aspect of the oscillatory regime .",
    "nevertheless , for the complete description of the asymptotics near the singularity one need to know also the evolution of the directional vectors @xmath184 of the kasner axes and influence of this evolution on the structure of cosmological billiard .    in general in order to take into account the rotation of the frame",

    "the additional energy '' constraint ( [ hom55 ] ) has the same form:@xmath279 in the preceding section we showed that near the singularity ( @xmath280 @xmath15 ) all three quantities @xmath281 go to zero which means that all three exponents @xmath282 @xmath283 @xmath284 tend to plus infinity .",
    "consequently , in this limit the potential vanishes everywhere except in the narrow regions near the reflecting walls @xmath285 @xmath286 @xmath287 the first of these is the same _ gravitational wall _ as in the case of non - rotating axes but the other two represent the new _ centrifugal walls . _ if we look to the exact potential written out in the lagrangian ( [ ix-20-a ] ) we see that the old walls @xmath288 and @xmath289 , of course , still remain in the system but near to the singularity they ceased to be dominant , that is they have no more influence on the dynamics in the first approximation . instead the new centrifugal walls @xmath290 @xmath291 became dominant , pressing back the old two behind them .",
    "then the new billiard table occupies now only 1/6 part of the volume of the old triangle ( the old triangle we should cut by the three bisectrices which are the new centrifugal walls and take only one region bounded by the one old gravitational wall and by two new centrifugal walls ) .",
    "it turns out that also this new shortened part ( in spite of the fact that its two new reflecting borders are different ) of the old billiard table possesses the same four basic properties we enumerated at the end of the section cosmological billiard `` .",
    "the billiard for the general bianchi type ix model with rotating axes described in the present section also has the kac - moody symmetry but of a different type with respect to the one we discussed in section first manifestation of the hidden kac - moody algebra '' .",
    "now the fundamental weyl chamber in @xmath274- space has different boundary walls : @xmath285 @xmath292 @xmath293 and the vectors orthogonal to these walls are also different .",
    "these vectors we designate again by @xmath129 and in components they are : @xmath136 @xmath294 @xmath295 .",
    "the scalar products @xmath296 we again can arrange in the form of the matrix ( [ kac1 ] ) and calculation gives:@xmath168{ccc}2 & -2 & 0\\\\ -2 & 2 & -1\\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{array } \\right )   .\\label{kac4}\\ ] ] this is again a cartan matrix of indefinite type which corresponds to one of the infinite - dimensional lorenzian hyperbolic kac - moody algebras of rank 3 .",
    "this algebra has a variety of names depending on the authors who introduced it .",
    "we call it @xmath297 as in ref .",
    "( it also called @xmath298 in ref .  , @xmath299 in ref .  ) and @xmath300 in ref .  ) .    for the homogeneous model of bianchi type ix",
    "the approach which uses the orthogonal matrix @xmath198 has been developed in ref .  .",
    "although the corresponding generalization to the inhomogeneous case is straightforward , we never did it .",
    "however , the recent development of the theory has shown that even in most general inhomogeneous cases ( including multidimensional space - time filled by different kinds of matter ) there is another representation of the metric tensor leading to the same asymptotic freezing phenomenon of non - diagonal `` degrees of freedom and reducing the full dynamics to the few diagonal '' oscillating scale factors which can be described in the same way as the cosmological billiard .",
    "this is the so - called iwasawa ( triangular ) decomposition of the metric tensor first used by dhn @xcite and thoroughly investigated in ref .  .",
    "the point is that in the general inhomogeneous case it is convenient to use an upper triangular matrix @xmath301  ( with components @xmath302 where again the upper index numerates the rows and lower index corresponds to columns ) @xmath303{ccc}1 & n_{1 } & n_{2}\\\\ 0 & 1 & n_{3}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right )   \\text{\\ \\ } \\label{3}\\ ] ] and to write the line element in the form @xmath304 the diagonal matrix @xmath305 as well as the matrix @xmath301 are functions of all four coordinates but near the singularity the matrix @xmath301 tends to some time - independent limit and the components of @xmath305 oscillate between the walls of a potential of the same structure as ( [ hom116 ] ) .",
    "in refs .   we studied the problem of the influence of various kinds of matter upon the behavior of the general inhomogeneous solution of the gravitational field equations in the neighborhood of the singular point .",
    "it is clear that , depending on the form of the energy - momentum tensor , we may meet three different possibilities : ( i ) the oscillatory regime remains as it is in vacuum , i.e. , the influence of matter may be ignored in the first approximation ; ( ii ) the presence of matter makes the existence of kasner epochs near a singular point impossible ; ( iii ) kasner epochs exist as before , but matter affects the process of their formation and alternation .",
    "actually , all these possibilities may be realized .",
    "there is a case in which the oscillatory regime observed as a singular point is approached remains the same , in the first approximation , as in vacuum .",
    "this case is realized in a space filled with a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath306 for @xmath307 .",
    "no additional reflecting walls arise from the energy - momentum tensor in this case .    if @xmath308 we have the  stiff matter \" equation of state @xmath25 .",
    "this is an example of the second of the above - mentioned possibilities when neither kasner epoch nor oscillatory regime can exist in the vicinity of a singular point .",
    "this case has been investigated in refs .   where it has been shown that the influence of the  stiff matter \" ( equivalent to a massless scalar field ) results in the violation of the kasner relations ( [ or2 ] ) for the asymptotic exponents . instead we have@xmath309 where @xmath310 is an arbitrary three - dimensional function ( with the restriction @xmath311 ) to which the energy density @xmath312 of the matter is proportional ( in that particular case when the stiff matter source is realized as a massless scalar field @xmath233 its asymptotic is @xmath313 and this is the formal reason why we use the index @xmath233 for the additional exponent @xmath314 ) .",
    "thanks to ( [ 4 ] ) , in contrast to the kasner relations ( [ or2 ] ) , it is possible for all three exponents @xmath8 to be positive . in ref .",
    "it has been shown that , even if the contraction of space starts with the quasi - kasner epoch ( [ 4 ] ) during which one of the exponents @xmath8 is negative , the power law asymptotic behavior with all positive exponents is inevitably established after a finite number of oscillations and remains unchanged up to the singular point .",
    "thus , for the equation of state @xmath25 the collapse in the general solution is described by monotonic ( but anisotropic ) contraction of space along all directions .",
    "we constructed the asymptotics of the general solution near the cosmological singularity for this case explicitly in ref .  , see also refs .  .",
    "the disappearance of oscillations for the case of a massless scalar field should be considered as an isolated phenomenon which is unstable with respect to inclusion into the right hand side of the einstein equations with another kinds of fields .",
    "for instance , in the same paper @xcite we showed that if we add a vector field to the scalar field then the endless oscillations reappear .",
    "another example of the generic solution with smooth power law asymptotics can be constructed for the viscoelastic material with shear viscosity coefficient @xmath315 which near the singularity behaves as @xmath316 .",
    "this kind of matter can stabilize the friedmann cosmological singularity , and the corresponding generic solution of the einstein equations possessing an isotropic big bang ( or big crunch ) exists @xcite .",
    "the cosmological evolution in the presence of an electromagnetic field may serve as an example of the third possibility . in this case",
    "the oscillatory regime in the presence of matter is , as usual , described by the alternation of kasner epochs , but in this process the energy - momentum tensor plays a role as important as the three - dimensional curvature tensor .",
    "this problem has been treated by us in ref .  , where it has been shown that in addition to the vacuum reflecting walls , there are also new walls which arise from the energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field .    in ref .",
    "we have also studied the problem of the influence of yang - mills fields on the character of the cosmological singularity . for definiteness ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to fields corresponding to the gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "the study was performed in the synchronous reference system in the gauge in which the time components of all three vector fields are equal to zero .",
    "it was shown that , in the neighborhood of a cosmological singularity , the behavior of the yang - mills fields is largely similar to the behavior of the electromagnetic field : as before , there appears an oscillatory regime described by the alternation of kasner epochs , which is caused either by the three - dimensional curvature or by the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "if , in the process of the alternation of epochs , the energy - momentum tensor of the gauge fields is dominant , the qualitative behavior of the solution during the epochs and in the transition regions between them is like the behavior in the case of a free yang - mills field ( with an abelian symmetry group ) .",
    "this does not mean that non - linear terms of the interaction may be neglected completely , but the latter introduce only minor quantitative changes into the picture we would observe in the case of non - interacting fields .",
    "an interesting fact is that the bosonic sectors of supergravities emerging in the low energy limit from all types of superstring models have an oscillatory cosmological singularity of the bkl character @xcite . to clarify the main points consider an action of the following general form:@xmath317   , \\label{5}\\ ] ] where @xmath318 designates the field strengths generated by the @xmath319-forms @xmath320 , i.e. , @xmath321 .",
    "the real parameters @xmath322 are coupling constants corresponding to the interaction between the dilaton and @xmath319-forms . the tensorial operations in ( [ 5 ] ) are carried out with respect to the @xmath305-dimensional metric @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "now the lowercase latin letters refer to the tensorial indices of @xmath305-dimensional space - time and greek indices correspond to the @xmath325-dimensional tensorial indices , where @xmath326 we will use the two lowercase latin indices in brackets @xmath327 and @xmath328 as before to designate the frame indices of the @xmath325-dimensional space .",
    "also in this theory generalized kasner - like epochs exist which are of the form : @xmath329@xmath330,\\label{7}\\]]@xmath331 where @xmath332 are functions on space coordinates @xmath333 in the presence of the dilaton the exponents @xmath334and @xmath314 instead of the kasner law satisfy the relations analogous to ( [ 4 ] ) : @xmath335    the approximate solution ( [ 6])([8 ] ) follows from the @xmath305-dimensional einstein equations by neglecting the energy - momentum tensor of @xmath319-forms , @xmath325-dimensional curvature tensor @xmath336 and spatial derivatives of @xmath233 .",
    "now one has to do the work analogous to that one in 4-dimensional gravity : it is necessary to identify in all neglected parts of the equations those dangerous `` terms which destroy the solution ( [ 6])([8 ] ) in the limit @xmath15 . then one should construct the new first approximation to the equations taking into account also these dangerous  terms and try to find the asymptotic solution for this new system .",
    "this is the same method which was used in the case of 4-dimensional gravity and it also works well here . using the iwasawa decomposition for the @xmath325-dimensional metric @xmath337 where @xmath338 it can be shown @xcite that near the singularity again the phenomenon of freezing of the non - diagonal '' degrees of freedom of the metric tensor arises ( that is the matrix @xmath339 becomes time - independent ) and the system reduces to ordinary differential equations ( for each spatial point ) in time for the variables @xmath340 and @xmath233 .",
    "it is convenient to use the @xmath341-dimensional flat superspace with coordinates @xmath342 .",
    "the asymptotic dynamics for these variables follows from the lagrangian of the form similar to ( [ hom115]):@xmath343 where @xmath118 is defined again by the formula ( [ or3 - 11 ] ) in which the letter @xmath112 should be replaced by @xmath274 and the time variable @xmath92 relates to the synchronous time @xmath91 by the formula @xmath344 .",
    "the @xmath345component of the einstein equations gives the additional condition to the solutions of the equations of motion : @xmath346 the sum in the potential means summation over all relevant ( dominating ) impenetrable walls ( numerated by the index @xmath347 ) located at hypersurfaces where @xmath348 .",
    "all functional parameters @xmath349 ( depending on the coordinates @xmath1 ) in general are positive .",
    "the free motion of a particle between the walls in the original @xmath341-dimensional superspace with coordinates @xmath350 is projected onto geodesic motion on the hyperbolic @xmath325-dimensional @xmath150-space by the same type of the projection used in 4-dimensional gravity:@xmath351   ^{2}=-1,\\text { } \\rho = const.,\\label{22}\\ ] ] that is to motion between the corresponding projections of the original walls @xmath348 onto @xmath150-space .",
    "these projections bound a region in @xmath352-space inside of which a symbolic particle oscillates and the volume of this region , in spite of its non - compactness , is finite .",
    "the last property is of principle significance since it leads , as in the 4-dimensional case , to the chaotic character of the oscillatory regime .",
    "of course , the central point here is to find all the aforementioned dominant walls and corresponding wall forms \" @xmath353 this depends on the space - time dimension and menu of @xmath319-forms . in refs",
    ".   the detailed description of all the possibilities for all types of supergravities ( i.e. , eleven - dimensional supergravity and those following from the known five types of superstring models in ten - dimensional space - time ) can be found .",
    "it was shown that in all cases there are only 10 relevant walls governing the oscillatory dynamics .",
    "the huge number of other walls need not be considered because they are located behind these principal ten and have no influence on the dynamics in the first approximation .",
    "all dihedral angles between the dominant walls are equal to the numbers @xmath354 where @xmath355 belongs to some distinguished set of natural numbers ( or equal to infinity ) .",
    "this is exactly the geometrical structure which generates the set of 10 simple roots ( vectors normal to walls ) of an infinite - dimensional hyperbolic kac - moody algebra of rank 10 .",
    "the above - mentioned region in @xmath150-space represents the multidimensional  billiard table \" and the collection of its bounding cushions forms the generalization to the covering space of the so - called coxeter crystallographic simplex , that is , in the cases under consideration , a polyhedron with 10 faces in 9-dimensional @xmath150-space with special angles between the cushions .",
    "the fermionic sectors of supergravities have been thoroughly investigated by a number of authors which led to the construction of a super - billiard \" having both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
