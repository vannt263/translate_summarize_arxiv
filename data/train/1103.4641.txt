    "recent progress in preparing , controlling , and measuring the macroscopic quantum states of superconducting circuits with josephson junctions @xcite makes realization of a quantum computer an experimental possibility @xcite . two major roadblocks  decoherence and scalability ",
    "may soon be overcome by the so - called resonator / zero - qubit ( rezqu ) architecture , recently proposed by j. martinis @xcite .",
    "some of the basic operations of the rezqu architecture ( such as the idling operation , the generation and measurement of the single - excitation states , as well as the single - excitation transfer operation called move ) were analyzed in a joint paper @xcite .",
    "it was found , that the rezqu architecture is capable of providing high - fidelity performance required for quantum information processing .    in spite of the optimistic conclusions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , an important problem of generating _ high - fidelity entangling _ operations in the rezqu architecture still remains .",

    ". we have simulated this three - step approach for realistic rezqu parameters and found some difficulties with it , which are described in section [ sec : problems ] .",

    "the initial and final qubit frequencies , @xmath20 , are chosen in such a way as to avoid the @xmath21 and @xmath22 crossings .",
    "then , the standard @xcite three - step swap - based cz gate implementation ( fig . [ fig:2 ] ) suffers from the following major drawback : it produces a large number of landau - zener ( lz ) transitions , each of which degrades the resulting gate s fidelity .",
    "the rezqu architecture based on fixed couplings may not be flexible enough to provide the needed controllability to counter the effects of all these transitions in a three - step cz manner .",

    "here we propose to turn this particular drawback into an asset by dropping the loading and unloading swap operations altogether and employing the mentioned @xmath22 anticrossing to accumulate the needed 101-phase during the cz operation ( see fig .",

    "the following two problems may arise in our scheme .",
    "first , the presence of additional system elements ( qubits , memory resonators , etc . ) may result in additional states that are near - resonant with the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , thus leading to unwanted leakage . here",
    "we ignore this complication and assume that under realistic conditions it will always be possible to isolate this particular anticrossing sufficiently well .",
    "second , being a second - order process , accumulation of the 101-phase may proceed too slowly compared with the qubit coherence time ( currently at about @xmath32 ns ) .",
    "however , the following argument shows that this is not necessarily true .    in the case of a similar second order resonance @xmath21",

    "( [ eq : czmatrix ] ) , @xmath49 . notice , that we do not have to take into account the phase of the @xmath50 state , since the corresponding frequency @xmath51 can always be set to 0 .",
    "our cz gate may be viewed as a particular example of an `` idling error '' @xcite , which is a measure of how fast the phase of the _ computational _ eigenstatestate @xmath52 accumulates relative to the phases of eigenstates @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the error is characterized by the running frequency @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being the corresponding eigenenergies , and physically arises due to the level repulsion between 101 and other levels in the two - excitation subspace of the system .",

    "the system parameters must be set to maximize @xmath60 .",
    "one such choice , @xmath61 , which corresponds to the @xmath62 anticrossing , was made in our single - step implementation .",
    "to summarize , we introduced a scheme for single - step generation of a high - fidelity controlled - z gate in a three - component rezqu architecture . despite the use of a second - order anticrossing ,",
