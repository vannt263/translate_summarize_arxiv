    "the two general approaches to the determination of the free - energy function can be categorized as equilibrium and dynamic ones , and lead to different nontrivial structural and dynamic properties of nematic liquid crystals.@xcite    equilibrium approaches are focused on the direct calculation of the canonical distribution function , the partition function and the free - energy by taking into account the general symmetry properties of the system.@xcite for uniaxial systems , this implies that the fourth order scalar orientational parameter can be expressed in terms of the second order scalar orientational parameter .",
    "@xcite recently , a step forward in the equilibrium approach has been given in ref .",
    "[ 19 ] where , by using the maximum entropy principle based on gibbs entropy postulate,@xcite a very general method for calculating the free - energy was proposed .",
    "in contrast , dynamic approaches to the problem are based on a closure of the evolution equations for the hierarchy of moments of the non - equilibrium distribution function , typically obtained from a fokker - planck equation.@xcite an excellent analysis of the physical consistency of several dynamic closures proposed in the literature is given in ref . [ 18 ] .",
    "we consider that these two approaches to the problem are complementary since the equilibrium canonical distribution containing the specific interaction model for the system may be used to calculate both , the equilibrium free energy and the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the non - equilibrium case.@xcite    in general , the results obtained by these two approaches are different even if the same interaction model is assumed . to take an example , for the maier - saupe interaction model in the uniaxial case , which introduces a parameter @xmath0 measuring the degree of coupling of one molecule with the average system surrounding it , the equilibrium approach leads to an expression of the free energy in which the dependence on @xmath0 enters through one term ( see , for instance , eq .",

    "in fact , the expression of this function depends on the way in which the hierarchy of equations is closed .",
    "this situation is usual in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics when dealing with closure problems .",
    "different approximations may have advantages under different physical conditions .",
    "we may attribute these differences between free energies derived from equilibrium and dynamic approaches to the fact that dynamic closures may incorporate the effect of the relaxation of , in principle , all the moments of the distribution function . as a consequence of this ,",
    "it is important to check the performance of the obtained results by following general criteria , such as those proposed in ref .",
    "in addition , because the equilibrium approach is general , it seems appropriate to establish a distinction by referring to a _ free energy _ when it is derived from equilibrium schemes and to a _ free - energy like _ function when the corresponding quantity is derived from dynamic calculations.@xcite    here , we concentrate our analysis on the dynamic closure approach for uniaxial systems and its coupling with the evolution equation of system s mass density .",
    "this non - homogenous problem is less studied in the literature despite its great interest because it allows to analyze the physical conditions in which an appropriate perturbation may produce patterns and/or traveling structures in the system . a question of great technological interest .",
    "the existence of these spatial and temporal structures is analyzed by first using , in section ii , the gibbs entropy postulate@xcite and the rules of mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics@xcite in order to derive a fokker - planck equation governing the evolution of the non - homogeneous distribution of particle orientations . in section iii , this equation is used in turn to derive the evolution equations of the second and fourth order orientational tensor parameters in the homogeneous case . then , the dynamic closure problems addressed in section iv , where we consider a recent approach@xcite to determine the forth order scalar parameter as a function of the second order one and then obtain the corresponding evolution equation for the scalar second order parameter .",

    "<S> pattern formation in uniaxial polymeric liquid crystals is studied for different dynamic closure approximations . using the principles of mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics in a mean - field approach , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a fokker - planck equation for the single - particle non - homogeneous distribution function of particle orientations and the evolution equations for the second and fourth order orientational tensor parameters . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , two dynamic closure approximations are discussed , one of them considering the relaxation of the fourth order orientational parameter and leading to a novel expression for the free - energy like function in terms of the scalar order parameter . considering the evolution equation of the density of the system and values of the interaction parameter for which isotropic and nematic phases coexist , our analysis predicts that patterns and traveling waves can be produced in lyotropic uniaxial nematics even in the absence of external driving . </S>"
