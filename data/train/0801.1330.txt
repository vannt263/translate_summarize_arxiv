    "under certain conditions , the energy carried by photons in the dielectric medium is transferred to collective excitations of free electrons in the metal . because the free electrons in the metal are coupled to the photons in the dielectric medium , the quantum is called a _ surface plasmon polariton _",

    "surface plasmon_. a classical understanding of the surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) is in terms of a electromagnetic surface wave that propagates along the interface and decays exponentially with distance normal to the interface .",

    "basically the same kind of wave at optical frequencies , the spp wave became the subject of intense investigation@xcite from the middle part of the 20th century .",

    "the bulk metal is in the form of a sufficiently thin film of uniform thickness , bounded by dielectric mediums on both sides , one medium being optically denser than the other .",

    "the plane wave must be @xmath0polarized .",
    "the telltale sign is a sharp peak in absorbance ( i.e. , a sharp trough in reflectance without a compensatory peak in transmittance ) as the angle of incidence ( with respect to the thickness direction ) of the launched plane wave is changed .",
    "the absorbance peak occurs in the vicinity of the critical angle ( of incidence ) that would exist if the metal film were absent .    generally , the optically rarer medium is homogeneous normal to its planar interface with the metal film , at least within the range of the spp field . in this paper",
    ", however , we take the optically rarer medium to be continuously nonhomogeneous in the thickness direction .",
    "specifically , this medium is a sculptured thin film ( stf ) .",
    "stfs are nanostructured materials with unidirectionally varying continuum properties that can be designed and realized in a controllable manner using physical vapor deposition @xcite .",
    "the ability to virtually instantaneously change the growth direction of their columnar morphology , through simple variations in the direction of the incident vapor flux , leads to a wide variety of @xmath1nm  diameter columns of two or three  dimensional shapes , as illustrated by the scanning electron micrographs in figs .",
