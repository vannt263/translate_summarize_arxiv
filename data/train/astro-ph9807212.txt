    "the origin of cosmic @xmath1ray bursts ( grbs ; @xcite , @xcite ) is still one of the outstanding problems in modern astronomy .",
    "the breakthrough in this field has been the discovery of long - lived x - ray afterglows of grbs ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , etc . ) using the bepposax satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "this enabled the discovery of optical ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) , and radio ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) afterglows and their subsequent studies . several optical transients ( ots ) associated with grbs have been found . in the case of grb 970508 a lower limit to the redshift of the ot",
    "was obtained , based on intervening absorption systems ( @xcite ) . in each case , a faint galaxy was found at the same location ( within a fraction of an arcsecond ) , after the ot faded .",
    "redshifts have been obtained for three such grb host galaxies : @xmath6 for grb 970508 ( @xcite ) , @xmath0 for grb 971214 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath7 for grb 980703 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements have established that most or all grbs are located at cosmological distances ( @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the most spectacular case so far is grb 971214 . following the detection of the burst and its x - ray afterglow ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , an ot",
    "was found ( @xcite ) .",
    "detailed optical and infrared follow - up observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) resulted in the detection of the host galaxy , measurement of its redshift ( @xmath0 ) , and the determination of the physical parameters of the afterglow .",
    "little is known concerning the geomerty of the detonations producing grbs and we assume here an isotropic release , implying an energy from the burst in @xmath1-rays of @xmath2 erg , some two orders of magnitude higher than the previously commonly assumed numbers .",
    "the high redshift and the spectacular energetics of this burst make it worthy of a detailed study .",
    "here we report on hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of the host galaxy of this burst , about four months after the burst itself .",
    "hst observations of the grb 971214 field were obtained on april 13 1998 ut using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis , @xcite ) .",
    "the ccd camera was used in imaging mode with the clear ( 50ccd ) filter .",
    "this provides an essentially unfiltered bandpass defined by the quantum efficiency of the ccd , covering @xmath8200010000  with a peak sensitivity at @xmath85852  . a total exposure of 11862 seconds",
    "was collected over four consecutive orbits .",
    "four images were taken per dither position to facilitate cosmic ray removal .",
    "initial data processing followed standard stsci pipeline procedures , including bias and dark current subtraction , flat field division and cosmic ray removal .",
    "the dithered images were combined in two ways to produce science ",
    "grade composite images .",
    "we created ( i ) a simple median of the image registered on the original stis detector scale of @xmath9/pixel , and ( ii ) a composite image using the `` drizzling '' algorithm ( described , e.g. , in @xcite and @xcite ) with a scale of @xmath10/pixel . the background r.m.s .  per original stis pixel (",
    "gain = 1 elec / adu ) was 0.0037 adu / second corresponding to a @xmath11 detection threshold per pixel of @xmath1226 .",
    "figure 1 shows a portion of the drizzled stack image of the field .",
    "the burst host galaxy shows a compact , somewhat irregular morphology which is relatively common for galaxies at comparable magnitudes and redshifts as observed with the hst .    in order to establish the exact positional relation of the burst afterglow and the host galaxy , we performed relative astrometry between the drizzled hst image and ground - based images obtained with the keck - ii 10-m telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used the i band image obtained on 16 december 1997 ut , approximately 1.6 days after the burst , while the ot was still bright and dominated the total light from the object .",
    "two different centering algorithms and two different coordinate transformations were used , with all methods giving consistent results within estimated errors .    comparing the positions of the ot and the host galaxy in the keck data alone we find a displacement of @xmath13 arcsec .",
    "computing the relative positions of the host galaxy as detected in the keck data and in the hst data , we obtain a displacement of @xmath14 arcsec , i.e. , consistent with zero . for the offset between the ot in the keck image and the host galaxy in the hst image we find a displacement of @xmath3 arcsec , in an excellent agreement with the keck measurements of @xcite .",
    "the computed position of the ot in the hst image is shown in fig .",
    "the offset from the apparent nucleus of the host is only a @xmath15 result , however the ot position lies at a position angle coincident with that of the extended `` disk - like '' extensions of the host , adding weight to the argument that the grb occurred in the outer portion of the host galaxy .    the surface density of objects in our stis field that are at least as bright as the proposed host is 136 arcmin@xmath16 .",
    "the probability of having a chance positional coincidence within 0.2 arcsec is @xmath17 , in excellent agreement with the keck measurements ( @xcite ) . moreover , even with the superior angular resolution and depth of the hst data we see no sign of a possible foreground galaxy superposed on the image of the proposed host .",
    "we thus conclude that this galaxy is indeed the host of grb 971214 .",
    "because of the extremely broad bandpass used here , we can not place our measured stis photometry unambiguously on any standard photometric system .",
    "given a typical spectral energy distribution for distant star forming galaxies ( @xcite ) and the bandpass of the 50ccd system , the ab magnitudes provided here probably correspond roughly to those that would be measured through standard @xmath18 or @xmath19 bandpasses .",
    "surface photometry of the host galaxy was performed on the median and drizzle images using the morpho package ( @xcite ) .",
    "radial surface brightness profiles computed from both the median and drizzle composites are shown in fig .",
    "3 along with the stis stellar psf modeled by @xcite for the 50ccd filter .",
    "the host galaxy is clearly well resolved , although the question of how best to decompose the light profile remains open . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 we plot the profile in @xmath20 coordinates , and a significant downturn at small radii , even relative to the psf curve , suggests that the profile may be dominated by an exponential profile . integrating the extrapolated surface brightness profiles gives a total magnitude of 26.62 and 26.61 for the median and drizzle images respectively . correcting for a negligible amount of foreground galactic extinction ( a@xmath21 mag , @xcite ) we adopt a total ab magnitude of 26.5 .",
    "the effective radius of the host galaxy was determined to be 0.16@xmath22 @xmath23 and was derived from the elliptically averaged growth curves from the median and drizzled images .",
    "the e - folding scale length of the profile was determined to lie in the range 0.15@xmath22 to 0.19@xmath22 .",
    "as already noted by @xcite , the spectroscopic and photometric properties of the host galaxy , i.e. , its luminosity , star formation rate , etc . , are typical for the field galaxies at comparable redshifts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the hst data enable us to make additional comparisons in terms of the morphology .",
    "we will assume a standard friedman model cosmology with @xmath24 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath0 , the luminosity distance is @xmath28 cm , and 1 arcsec corresponds to 7.83 physical kpc or 34.6 comoving kpc in projection . in this cosmology ,",
    "the observed luminosity of the galaxy is @xmath29 , in terms of the extrapolated continuum in the restframe b band as compared to the present - day b band luminosity function ( @xcite ) . at @xmath30",
    "our stis bandpass is measuring rest - frame uv wavelengths , and hence is dominated by light contributed by young massive stars . using a k - correction to estimate the corresponding rest - frame optical luminosity is uncertain due to our present lack of data on the seds and dust absorption properties of @xmath313 galaxies .",
    "following @xcite we choose to quote the luminosity in the uv rest - frame . in terms of the far - uv luminosity function",
    "as observed among the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath32 , the host has an observed luminosity @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation rate not corrected for any absorption is @xmath34 yr@xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "accounting for the typical extinction measured in galaxies at comparable redshifts ( @xcite ) would probably increase these numbers by a factor of a few , although the relatively strong l@xmath35 line emission argues against a very heavy extinction .",
    "our measured effective radius for the light distribution in the host galaxy is @xmath36 kpc .",
    "this is typical for the spectroscopically confirmed normal galaxies at comparable redshifts ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and is also comparable to the effective radii of moderate - luminosity bulges at low redshifts .",
    "moreover , the morphology of a compact core surrounded with a slightly irregular envelope , as observed in this case , is also commonly seen among the field galaxies at @xmath37 ( @xcite ) . on the whole ,",
    "the physical properties of the host galaxy of grb 971214 appear to be typical of the field galaxy population at comparable redshifts .",
    "these objects are now generally interpreted as the progenitors of normal , @xmath38 galaxies today , or at least as young bulges of normal spirals .",
    "the observed star formation rate in this object is also typical for normal galaxies at @xmath32 , and is not excessively high . while it is plausible that the physical origin of grbs is somehow related to massive star formation , we see no evidence that grbs favor extreme starbursts .",
    "the small , but significant positional offset between the ot and the host galaxy nucleus , also observed in the case of grb 970228 ( @xcite ) , argues against models where grbs originate from active galactic nuclei or massive central black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "the offsets are sufficiently small so that the grb progenitors are likely to be gravitationally bound to their host galaxies and may not be old systems with large spatial velocities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , more ot - host offset measurements made with high resolution hst images will be needed to convincingly address this issue .",
    "there are two apparently foreground galaxies within about @xmath39 of the ot , one of them at @xmath40 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is in principle possible that the ot was ejected from one of these galaxies and superposed to within @xmath41 on a background galaxy at @xmath0 , although as we ve already pointed out this is statistically very unlikely",
    ". however , there is clear evidence for extinction in the broadband spectrum of the ot ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this would be hard to understand if the ot were located in the outer halo of a @xmath42 galaxy , but it is easily understood if it were located within the inner portion of an actively star - forming galaxy .",
    "the hosts for all three of the grbs 970508 , 971214 , and 980703 form a pattern in which the optical transient is found within the boundaries of a moderate to large redshift host .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that one of the galaxies with a separation @xmath43 from the grb 971214 ot could be the host .",
    "finally , we note that a host galaxy was found in every case when either an ot was detected or a fading radio transient was observed .",
    "such host galaxies of grbs observed to date have comparably faint magnitudes , @xmath44 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this removes the so - called `` no host galaxy problem '' for grbs .",
    "moreover , given that most or all of them are likely to be at high redshifts , @xmath45 or greater , there is no need to invoke the hypothesis that grbs somehow favor dwarf galaxies .",
    "we are grateful to r. williams of stsci for the allocation of the director s discretionary time for this project , and to the entire bepposax team for their efforts .",
    "this work was supported in part by the hst grant go-7964 , the bressler foundation ( sgd , sco ) , and grants from nsf and nasa ( srk ) ."
