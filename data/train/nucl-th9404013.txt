    "over the last several years there has been renewed interest in the production of @xmath5mesons with protons , pions and electrons and their interaction with nucleons and nuclei .",
    "one of the first @xmath5nuclear experiments , performed at saturne in 1988@xcite , reported surprisingly large eta production rates near threshold in the reaction d(p,@xmath5)@xmath6he .",
    "these large cross sections permitted not only a more precise determination of the @xmath5mass@xcite but were also used to perform rare decay measurements of the eta@xcite .",
    "additional experiments involving pion induced eta production were performed at los alamos@xcite .",
    "again , the experimental cross sections at threshold region of the reaction @xmath6he(@xmath7)@xmath6h are above the theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "the advent of high duty - cycle electron accelerators opens for the first time the opportunity to study the reactions @xmath8 and @xmath9 in greater detail .",
    "our present knowledge of the @xmath3 process is based solely on some old measurements around 20 years ago@xcite , along with very few more recent data from bates@xcite and tokyo@xcite . with the recent completion of the electron accelerators at mainz",
    "( mami b ) and bonn ( elsa ) and the construction of new spectrometers and detectors it is now possible to measure eta photoproduction from threshold at 707 mev up to 850 mev at mainz and even higher energies at bonn with a precision similar to the one obtained in pion photoproduction experiments .",
    "a large amount of data has already been taken and is currently being analyzed@xcite .",
    "unlike pion photoproduction , low energy theorems ( @xmath10 ) can not be derived for eta photoproduction for the following three reasons : ( _ i _ ) the expansion parameter @xmath11 is too large to provide convergence up to order @xmath12 ; ( _ ii _ ) due to large @xmath13 mixing with a mixing angle of about @xmath14 and a non - conserved axial singlet current @xmath15 for the @xmath16 , there is no @xmath17 theorem for eta mesons ; ( _ iii _ ) there are nucleon resonances , mainly the @xmath0 close at threshold ( @xmath18 mev ) strongly violating the condition that the internal excitation energy must be larger than the mass of the meson@xcite .",
    "nucleon resonance excitation is the dominant reaction process in @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to pions which will excite @xmath19 as well as @xmath20 resonances , the @xmath5 meson will only appear in the decay of @xmath21 resonances with @xmath22 .",
    "in the low - energy region this is dominantly the @xmath0 state that decays in 45 - 55% into @xmath23 , the only nucleon resonance with such a strong branching ratio in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "this result is even more surprising as a near - by resonance of similar structure , the @xmath24 has a branching ratio of only 1.5% .",
    "this `` @xmath5 puzzle '' is not yet understood in quark models of the nucleon .",
    "most attempts to describe eta photoproduction on the nucleon@xcite have involved breit  wigner functions for the resonances and either phenomenology or a lagrangian approach to model the background .",
    "these models which contain a large number of free parameters were then adjusted to reproduce the few available data . in a very different approach , ref .",
    "@xcite derived a dynamical model which employs @xmath25 and @xmath26 to fix the hadronic vertex as well as the propagators and the @xmath27 to construct the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "this calculation represents a prediction rather than a fit to the @xmath28 reaction .",
    "here we extend the model of ref .",
    "@xcite by taking into account the background from @xmath29channel nucleon born terms and @xmath30 exchange in the @xmath31channel . since the resonance sector is fixed in our approach and also the vector meson couplings can be obtained from independent sources , we can use this model to extract information on the @xmath4 coupling .",
    "furthermore , we apply the operator to elastic eta photoproduction on the very light nuclei , @xmath32 , @xmath6he , @xmath6h and @xmath33he . due to spin and isospin selection rules , measuring a combination of processes on these light nuclei with well - known nuclear structure",

    "ii we shortly summarize the resonance model of ref .",
    "@xcite and describe our full @xmath3 operator . sec .",
    "iii contains our discussion of the elementary @xmath4 vertex .",
    "the possibility to get new information about nucleon resonances in the eta channel with the help of polarization observables is discussed in sec .",
    "the formalism for eta photoproduction on nuclei is derived in a coupled channel framework in sec .",
    "v and we present predictions for differential cross sections of elastic @xmath3 on @xmath32 , @xmath6he , @xmath6h and @xmath33he . in sec .",
    "vi we summarize our findings and present a brief outlook . in the appendix we present the definitions of the 16 polarization observables for photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons and give expansions in cgln amplitudes and dominant multipoles .",
    "the dynamical model of bennhold and tanabe@xcite is based on the observation that near the @xmath5 production threshold three nucleon resonances @xmath34 and @xmath0 play an important role . assuming an isobar model for each partial wave the transition amplitude can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the invariant energy and @xmath37 denotes the @xmath38 and @xmath23 channels , respectively .",
    "the vertex functions @xmath39 are parametrized with coupling strengths and formfactors and the @xmath21 propagators are given by @xmath40 with the bare resonance mass @xmath41 .",
    "the self - energy @xmath42 associated with the @xmath38 and @xmath23 intermediate states is given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 denoting the nucleon mass .",
    "the two - pion decay width @xmath46 is parametrized with one free parameter . the six parameters in this approach have been determined for each partial wave by a least - squares fit to all data of the reactions @xmath47 and @xmath26 and can be found in ref.@xcite .    in order to use this operator more conveniently , especially in nuclear applications with multidimensional integrals",
    ", we have obtained simple parametrizations of the self - energy @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , in very good agreement with the exact numerical values .    @xmath48    with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the step function @xmath51 .",
    "the parameters are given in table i. finally the decay width in the 2@xmath52channel is given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "with the hadronic vertices and propagators determined , the photoproduction amplitudes for @xmath57 and @xmath3 are given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the born terms and @xmath60 is the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "the latter was determined by using pion photoproduction data . by this way no free parameters are introduced in the @xmath3 process . since ref.@xcite neglected the born terms in the @xmath5channel , @xmath61 , the model consisted of four @xmath3 multipoles only , the @xmath0 appears in the dominant @xmath62 , the @xmath1 in the @xmath63 and the @xmath2 in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "while neglecting the @xmath3 born terms was within the uncertainties of the older experimental data for the proton , they play a more important role when comparison with better data becomes possible .",
    "furthermore , including the background properly becomes necessary in nuclear reactions like the coherent @xmath5 photoproduction on @xmath33he , where the dominant excitation of the @xmath66 resonance is forbidden .",
    "the evaluation of the background terms is straightforward and in complete analogy to @xmath67 except for the fact that the @xmath5 is an isoscalar meson and two types of @xmath4 couplings are possible : pseudovector ( pv ) and pseudoscalar ( ps ) .",
    "the latter one is not ruled out by let as in the case of @xmath57 .",
    "the effective lagrangians for both types of the @xmath4 coupling are given by @xmath68 with the electromagnetic lagrangian @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the isoscalar and isovector anomalous magnetic moments and @xmath72 we can evaluate the @xmath73 and @xmath74channel born terms .",
    "expressed in the @xmath75 basis @xmath76 we obtain the following amplitudes for pseudoscalar coupling    @xmath77\\,,\\\\ f_2(ps)&=&g_{\\eta}\\,\\frac{c\\mid \\vec{q } \\mid}{e_2+m}\\left[\\left(e_n+ \\frac{w+m}{2m}\\kappa_n\\right)d+ \\frac{(t - m_{\\eta}^2)\\kappa_n}{2m(w+m)(u - m^2)}\\right]\\,,\\\\ f_3(ps)&=&g_{\\eta}\\,c\\mid \\vec{q } \\mid \\left[2e_n\\frac{w - m}{t - m_{\\eta}^2 } d-\\frac{\\kappa_n}{m(u - m^2)}\\right]\\,,\\\\ f_4(ps)&=&g_{\\eta}\\,\\frac{c\\mid \\vec{q } \\mid^2}{e_2+m^2 } \\left[-2e_n\\frac{w+m}{t - m_{\\eta}^2}d- \\frac{\\kappa_n}{m(u - m^2)}\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the nucleon energy in the initial ( final ) state , and @xmath81 for pseudovector coupling we get @xmath82 and no change for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that the difference between pseudoscalar and pseudovector coupling arises only from the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon .    in the above equations ( where @xmath85 ) the amplitudes are expressed for the protons and neutrons separately with @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "alternatively we can define the isoscalar and isovector amplitudes @xmath90 and @xmath91 via @xmath92    due to the decay of the vector mesons @xmath93 and @xmath94 into @xmath95 we also have to include the @xmath31channel born diagrams which we evaluate from the lagrangians @xmath96 with @xmath97 like the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath98 .",

    "ii we give the coupling constants and cut  off masses for the background contributions .",
    "for the vector mesons we have introduced dipole formfactors @xmath102 at the @xmath103 vertex given by the bonn potential@xcite , for the @xmath4 coupling the formfactors turned out to be insensitive in the energy region of our interest and have been ignored . the main effect would result in a renormalization of the coupling constant .",
    "the electromagnetic v@xmath104 couplings are obtained from the partial decay widths of the vector mesons .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath38-interaction , little is known about the @xmath105-interaction and , consequently , about the @xmath4 vertex . as it was mentioned before , in the case of pion scattering and pion photoproduction",
    "the @xmath106 coupling is preferred to be pseudovector ( pv ) , in accord with current algebra results and chiral symmetry .",
    "however , because the eta mass is so much larger than the pion mass - leading to large su(3 ) x su(3 ) symmetry breaking - and because of the @xmath13 mixing there is no compelling reason to select the pv rather than the ps form for the @xmath4 vertex .",
    "the uncertainty regarding the structure of the @xmath4 vertex extends to the magnitude of the coupling constant .",
    "this coupling constant @xmath107 varies between @xmath108 and @xmath109 with the large couplings arising from fits of one boson exchange potentials .",
    "typical values obtained in fits with the bonn potential@xcite can lie anywhere between 3 - 7 .",
    "however , including the @xmath5 yields only small effects in fitting the @xmath110 phase shifts and , furthermore , provides an insignificant contribution to nuclear binding at normal nuclear densities . from su(3 ) flavor symmetry all coupling constants between the meson octet and the baryon octet are determined by one free parameter @xmath111 , giving @xmath112 resulting in values for the coupling constant between @xmath113 and @xmath114 for commonly used values of @xmath111 between @xmath115 , depending on the f and d strengths chosen as the two types of su(3 ) octet meson - baryon couplings .",
    "other determinations of the @xmath4 coupling employ reactions involving the eta , such as @xmath26 , and range from 0.6 - 1.7@xcite .",
    "smaller values are supported by @xmath110 forward dispersion relations@xcite with @xmath116 .",
    "there is some rather indirect evidence that also favors a small value for @xmath117 . in ref.@xcite , piekarewicz calculated the @xmath52@xmath5 mixing amplitude in the hadronic model where the mixing was generated by @xmath118 loops and thus driven by the proton  neutron mass difference . to be in agreement with results from chiral perturbation theory the @xmath119 coupling had to be constrained to the range 0.32  0.53 . in a very different approach ,",
    "hatsuda@xcite evaluated the proton matrix element of the flavor singlet axial current in the large @xmath120 chiral dynamics with an effective lagrangian that included the @xmath121(1 ) anomaly . in this framework",
    ", the emc data on the polarized proton structure function ( which have been used to determine the `` strangeness content '' of the proton ) can be related to the @xmath122 and the @xmath119 coupling constants .",
    "again , his analysis prefers small values for both coupling constants .",
    "nevertheless , from the above discussion it seems clear that the @xmath4 coupling constant is much smaller compared to the corresponding @xmath106 value of around 14 .    since in our model",
    "the resonance sector is well constrained by other related but independent reactions we use the @xmath3 data to extract information on the @xmath4 vertex . in table",
    "iii we give the individual contributions to the threshold @xmath62 multipole for protons and neutrons .",
    "while the @xmath66 contribution is complex , the background contribution from born terms and vector mesons is real . in the table ,",
    "the born ps and pv terms are calculated for a coupling of @xmath123 and scales proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "note that for a coupling of @xmath124 the background vanishes in a pseudoscalar model . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the sensitivity of the total cross section close to threshold when varying the coupling constant from 0 to 3 for the ps and from 0 to 10 for the pv form .",
    "there is a large variation of more than a factor of two at 750 mev for the ps case while changing the value with pv structure modifies the cross section only by a relatively small amount .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that the pv vertex contains momentum dependence which influences mostly the p - wave multipoles . on the other hand , at threshold",
    "the total cross section is dominated by the s - wave multipole due to the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "a similar effect can be observed in @xmath125 at threshold where the ps born terms overpredict the let prediction by a large amount while the pv form agrees with the small let value .",
    "however , using only the total cross section data does not allow to uniquely determine the coupling constant .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , one obtains similar total cross sections for a ps coupling of 0.1 and a pv coupling of 6.0 .",
    "data that would fall below this curve could only be explained with a pseudoscalar model .",
    "for example , a coupling strength of @xmath126 gives results very close to the pure resonance contribution .",
    "large ps couplings around 1.0 or 1.4 suggested in previous eta photoproduction studies @xcite would be consistent only with data considerably below 15 @xmath127 at the maximum . using only the old data shown in fig .",
    "2 no definite conclusion can be reached at this point .    since the total cross section alone can not unambiguously delineate between the two different coupling modes , we present in fig .",
    "3 calculations for the differential cross section at the four different photon energies that were used in the mainz experiment currently under analysis .",
    "note that both computations performed in the ps- and pv - model give roughly the same total cross section .",
    "there is a clear distinction in the forward - backward asymmetry of the angular distribution between the ps- and pv - model . while the older data at 750 mev ( shown in fig .",
    "3 ) can not uniquely distinguish between the two coupling schemes the new preliminary mainz data with very small error bars indicate a clear preference for a ps - vertex with a small coupling constant .",
    "the variation in the angular distributions is again due to the @xmath128-wave multipoles .",
    "in particular , the @xmath63 multipole changes sign between ps and pv coupling .",
    "in order to obtain a detailed understanding of the eta photoproduction process and resonance phenomena associated with it , it would be desirable to perform a multipole analysis along the lines that have been pursued in pion photoproduction for over twenty years .",
    "multipoles offer the possibility to especially study resonance properties in detail since - due to their particular quantum numbers - resonances contribute only to one specific multipole for @xmath129 and to two multipoles ( electric and magnetic ) for @xmath130 .",
    "in contrast to pion photoproduction , where the @xmath131 resonance dominates for the first 400 mev above threshold , there are three resonances in eta photoproduction right at threshold - the dominant @xmath0 , and the weaker @xmath2 and @xmath1 states .",
    "additional resonances - such as the @xmath132 - are expected to contribute significantly in the region of 200 - 400 mev above threshold .",
    "furthermore , the suppression of the born terms in the @xmath3 process due to the small @xmath4 coupling constant offers the opportunity to extract valuable resonance information from the @xmath3 multipoles .    in fig .",
    "4 we present the real and imaginary part of the @xmath62 multipole as a function of the photon energy . clearly , the @xmath66 resonance dominates this multipole and provides the only contribution to the @xmath133 since the born terms and vector meson contributions - being small and opposite in sign - have no imaginary part .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath66 resonance at threshold shows the futility of extracting @xmath10 values at threshold .",
    "regarding the @xmath4 vertex , the @xmath62 is insensitive to the difference between the ps- and pv- coupling by properly adjusting the coupling constants as was shown in fig .",
    "this situation changes dramatically for the real part of the @xmath63 multipole shown in fig .",
    "this @xmath128-wave multipole which is positive for ps- but negative for pv - coupling is responsible for the variation in the forward - backward asymmetry in the differential cross sections of fig .",
    "3 .    in fig . 6 we present the recoil polarization @xmath134 which is proportional to the @xmath63 multipole @xmath135 thus , the ps - coupling leads to a positive @xmath134 , supported by a single data point available in this energy region , while pv - coupling leads a negative recoil polarization . besides the sensitivity to the nature of the @xmath4-vertex , fig .",
    "6 also shows the presence of the @xmath1 state ( roper resonance ) in the real part of the @xmath63 multipole .",
    "just as this resonance is not easily identified in other electromagnetic reactions it is not very noticeable in the eta photoproduction process as well .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the effect of the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 resonances in the differential cross section , @xmath136 , the three single - polarization observables @xmath137 and the four double - polarization observables @xmath138 that require polarization of the beam and the target simultaneously .",
    "the energy of 752 mev is chosen to be in the region where the @xmath139 resonance has its maximum contribution . omitting the @xmath139 from our calculations",
    "gives dramatic effects in the beam asymmetry @xmath42 as well as in the double - polarization observable @xmath140 , but @xmath141 and @xmath142 also exhibit a significant sensitivity to the @xmath139 state .",
    "this is in contrast to the differential cross section that shows very little sensitivity to the @xmath139 state .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of the multipole contributions .",
    "especially the photon asymmetry @xmath42 , which changes from its maximum value around 0.4 at @xmath143 to almost zero when the @xmath2 is not included , the expansion into leading multipoles yields @xmath144\\;.\\ ] ] as in the previous case with the @xmath145 , the interference of the d - wave multipoles with the dominant @xmath62 gives such an enhanced sensitivity . while in general all observables of fig .",
    "7 are different , in this situation with @xmath66 dominance ( between 700 and 900 mev ) we find similar structures of @xmath42 and @xmath140 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and @xmath134 and @xmath142 . in future experiments with polarized photon beams and polarized targets comparisons of those pairs of observables",
    "can give valuable information on small background multipoles .",
    "furthermore , it can be used to separate real and imaginary parts of the resonance multipoles .",
    "currently , such polarization experiments are already in preparation at legs in brookhaven , graal in grenoble and cebaf with an expected start at the end of 1995 .    as an example for the @xmath148 multipoles , fig .",
    "8 depicts the real part of the @xmath64 multipole .",
    "note that this multipole is again clearly dominated by its resonance contribution since the born terms and vector mesons almost cancel .",
    "therefore , using total and differential cross section measurements should reveal the strong @xmath62 multipole , while the smaller @xmath149 and @xmath148 multipoles could be extracted with the help of polarization experiments .",
    "in the appendix we give the complete structure and definitions of the 16 observables in photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons as well as the expansion into leading multipoles .",
    "eta photoproduction on nuclei can be developed in a straightforward way by the same method which has been applied very successfully in pion photoproduction@xcite . in momentum space",
    "the nuclear photoproduction amplitude can be written as @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the photon , and @xmath152 is the eta or pion momentum .",
    "the total energy in the @xmath5-nucleus and @xmath52-nucleus channels is denoted by @xmath153 , the reduced mass is given by @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "@xmath156 is expressed in terms of the free eta ",
    "nucleon photoproduction t ",
    "matrix @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 denote the nuclear initial and final states , respectively , and @xmath160 refers to the individual target nucleons .    using the kmt version of multiple scattering theory@xcite the meson scattering amplitude @xmath161",
    "is constructed as a solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath162 here the meson - nuclear interaction is described by the first - oder potential @xmath163 which is related to the corresponding free @xmath164 matrix of meson - nucleon interaction@xcite .    at present our calculations have been carried out only for the first part of eq .",
    "( 19 ) , the plane wave impulse approximation ( @xmath165 ) . at this level , however , we do not perform any approximation treating the full spin degrees of freedom and taking fermi motion effects of the nucleon into account by performing the integration in momentum space . for the deuteron@xcite and",
    "@xmath6he/@xmath6h@xcite we use realistic nuclear wave functions . in the case of @xmath33he with @xmath166 a phenomenological nuclear formfactor",
    "is used which has been extracted from the charge distribution of @xmath33he .    by studying eta photoproduction on light nuclei with well  known nuclear structure",
    "we can learn about details of the elementary production operator which are difficult to see in the elementary reaction or , as for the neutron amplitude , are not experimentally accessible . in the deuteron case only the isoscalar amplitude contributes ; in @xmath6he the two protons saturate to spin 0 and contribute only to a very small part via the non  spin amplitude from the @xmath1 and background terms , while the residual neutron gives rise to a strong @xmath62 amplitude .",
    "finally , in the case of @xmath33he we can study the coherent amplitude of @xmath167 which is the isoscalar non  spin flip part and arises from small magnetic multipoles , e.g. @xmath63 and @xmath168 .",
    "besides studying the elementary amplitude , eta photoproduction offers the possibility to learn more about the @xmath23- and @xmath169-interaction .",
    "recently it has been suggested by wilkin@xcite that the very large production cross sections found in the @xmath170 reaction near threshold could be due to an @xmath23 scattering length that is much larger than the value extracted from a coupled - channels analysis of the @xmath171 and @xmath172 data@xcite .",
    "based on the k - matrix formalism , wilkin was able to reproduce the strong threshold energy dependence of @xmath173 by assuming an @xmath23 scattering length with a real part more than twice as large as in previous analyses .",
    "should this conclusion turn out to be true , it would have dramatic implications for the @xmath5-nucleus interaction .",
    "most importantly , a larger value for the scattering length might indicate a larger probability for the presence of a `` bound '' @xmath5-state for lighter nuclei such as @xmath6he than had been expected . in fact , this seems to be required to explain the cusp - like structure seen for near - threshold production in the @xmath174 reaction for a missing mass close to the @xmath5-mass .",
    "an uncertainty in wilkin s analysis arises from a cross section measurement of the @xmath175 process very close to threshold ( @xmath176200 kev ) that seems to contradict his description of the energy dependence .",
    "however , if this one point - which suffers from large systematic uncertainties - is ignored , impressive agreement with the experiment is achieved .",
    "a new experiment at saclay has already been approved to explore the energy dependence in the region very close to threshold @xcite .",
    "this effect may also remove the discrepancy between experiment and theory for the reaction @xmath177@xcite . in a future study",
    "we will address the significance of this large @xmath178-interaction in the @xmath179 cross section calculated in a full dwia framework .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the differential cross sections for all light nuclei up to @xmath33he .",
    "whereas the angular distribution is rather flat for nucleons , as shown before , it appears more and more peaked in forward direction for @xmath180 .",
    "this reflects the signature of the nuclear formfactors as the momentum transfer in @xmath5 photoproduction is rather large , @xmath181 = 7.8 @xmath182 at threshold .",
    "the biggest cross section can be expected for the trinucleon ; it is proportional to the free nucleon cross section multiplied by the square of the trinucleon formfactor .",
    "the triton cross section is about a factor of two larger than that for @xmath6he since the spin - flip amplitude on the proton - which is the largest among the possible spin - flip and non - spin - flip amplitudes on the proton and the neutron - can not contribute due to the pauli principle .",
    "therefore , the single proton in @xmath6h provides more strength than the two protons ( coupled mostly to spin 0 ) in @xmath6he .    around @xmath183 the cross section on the deuteron",
    "gains over the trinucleon , even though it is in large disagreement with the few available data .",
    "this may be due to the rather small isoscalar amplitude predicted by our model , @xmath184 . in the naive quark model",
    "the electromagnetic excitation of the @xmath66 is almost entirely isovector .",
    "however , rosenthal , forest and gonzales @xcite have shown that a color  hyperfine interaction , responsible also for the e2/m1 ratio of the @xmath185 excitation , could enhance the isoscalar @xmath66 excitation considerably .",
    "only an unrealistically large isoscalar amplitude of @xmath186 can explain the deuteron data in @xmath165 . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite if the final state interaction and the coupled @xmath187channels are taken into account then the discrepancy can be explained with @xmath188 .",
    "it also remains to be seen if the isoscalar amplitude is really as small as all present models predict .",
    "finally , the coherent cross section for @xmath33he vanishes for @xmath189 and reaches roughly the @xmath190 level in a small angular region . for most angles it falls below @xmath191",
    "it is an experimental challenge to measure this reaction which provides a clean observation of the background multipoles and of the roper resonance , as the dominant @xmath66 resonance is suppressed by spin and isospin .",
    "we have presented a model for eta photoproduction on the nucleon that includes nucleon born terms and t - channel vector meson exchanges in addition to the nucleon resonances @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the resonance sector is fixed by using data from other hadronic and electromagnetic reactions such as pion scattering and photoproduction and pion induced eta production .",
    "vector meson couplings are determined from their radiative decay widths and the @xmath110interaction .",
    "this allows using the new experimental data from bonn and mainz to extract information on the @xmath4 coupling . while the total @xmath3 cross section on the proton can be well reproduced by either a small coupling constant with ps  coupling or a large value with pv  form , the angular distribution singles out the small constant .",
    "while the resonance parameters of the @xmath66 can be extracted from high - precision total cross section data , the smaller resonances are hidden both in the differential and total cross sections . here",
    ", polarization observables will provide a powerful tool to constrain these small resonance couplings , as demonstrated for the case of the @xmath2 .",
    "such experiments have been proposed and will soon be performed at the legs facility at brookhaven national laboratory and at the new facility graal at grenoble .    finally , we have applied our operator to eta photoproduction on light nuclei d , @xmath6he , @xmath6h and @xmath33he .",
    "experiments on these nuclei are necessary to obtain complete information on the isospin structure of the @xmath3 amplitude . at",
    "forward angles the cross sections for @xmath3 on the trinucleon are reasonably large and should be measurable . here",
