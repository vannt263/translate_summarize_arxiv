    "the spectroscopic observations of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) opened a new window for the study of the physical and chemical properties of ir - bright , ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "most of our present knowledge of the mid - to - far infrared spectra of active and starburst galaxies is derived from iso spectroscopy ( fischer et al 1999 , sturm et al .",
    "2002 , verma et al .",
    "the mid - ir spectral range includes most of the fine - structure lines excited by the hard radiation produced by black hole accretion as well as those mainly excited by stellar ionization ( e.g. spinoglio & malkan 1992 ) and thus represents an essential tool to distinguish between the two processes , especially in obscured nuclei suffering severe dust extinction . in a complementary way",
    ", the far - ir range contains a large variety of molecular ( oh , h@xmath0o , high - j co ) and low excitation ionic / atomic transitions , in emission or in absorption , that can reveal the geometry and morphology of the circumnuclear and nuclear regions in galaxies .",
    "in particular these latter could trace the expected conditions of x - uv illuminated dusty tori ( see e.g. krolik & lepp 1989 for predictions of high - j co lines ) , whose presence in type 2 active galaxies is foreseen to reconcile the type1/type2 dichotomy .",
    "the far - ir spectra of local ir - bright and ulirgs galaxies , as measured by iso - lws ( fischer et al.1999 ) , showed an unexpected sequence of features , as can be seen in fig.1 , from strong [ oiii]52 , 88@xmath2 m and [ niii]57@xmath2 m line emission to detection of only faint [ cii]157@xmath2 m line emission and [ oi]63@xmath2 m in absorption .",
    "the [ cii]157@xmath2 m line in 15 ulirgs ( l@xmath3 ) revealed an order of magnitude deficit compared to normal and starburst galaxies relative to the fir continuum .",
    "non - pdr components , such as dust - bounded photoionization regions , generating much of the fir continuum but not contributing significant [ cii ] emission , can explain the [ cii ] deficiency .",
    "such environments may also explain the suppression of fir fine - structure emission from ionized gas and pahs , and the warmer fir colors of ulirgs ( luhman et al 2003 ) .",
    "examples of far - infrared molecular lines detected by iso include : oh at 34.6@xmath2 m , 53.3@xmath2 m , 79.1@xmath2 m and 119@xmath2 m connecting to the ground state , giving rise to absorption in most cases ; oh at 98.7@xmath2 m , 163@xmath2 m at higher energies , in emission ; h@xmath4o at 73.5@xmath2 m , 90@xmath2 m , 101@xmath2 m , 107@xmath2 m , 180@xmath2 m in emission or absorption . from the absorption lines the gas column and the abundance can be derived , from the emission lines we can measure the gas cooling and constrain the temperature and density of the warm ( 50@xmath5t@xmath5500k ) molecular gas .    lws observations of arp 220 show absorption in molecular lines of oh , h@xmath4o , ch , nh , and nh@xmath6 , as well as in the [ oi]63@xmath2 m line and faint emission in the [ cii]158@xmath2 m line .",
    "the molecular absorption in the nuclear region is characterized by high excitation due to high infrared radiation density ( gonzlez - alfonso et al 2004 ) .",
    "the lws spectrum of the prototype seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 , beside the expected ionic fine structure emission lines , shows the 79 , 119 and 163@xmath2 m oh rotational lines in emission , not in absorption as in every other galaxy yet observed .",
    "modeling the oh lines suggests the emitting gas lies in small ( 0.1pc ) and dense clouds ( @xmath7 ) most probably in the nuclear region and is potentially a signature of the torus ( spinoglio et al 2005 ) .    from the pioneering work of iso",
    "it appears that both the mid - infrared and the far - infrared are powerful tools to study the physical conditions in galaxies , often obscured by dust .",
    "the future far - infrared spectrometer esi ( swinyard 2006 ) at the focal plane of the helium cooled 3.5 m class telescope of the spica mission ( nakagawa 2004 , onaka & nakagawa 2005 ) , due to its high sensitivity , will be able to detect fir lines in local galaxies , near - to - mid infrared lines and dust / pah features in distant galaxies and possibly reveal the presence of large clusters of population iii stars through h recombination lines .",
    "mid - ir and far - ir spectroscopy of fine - structure emission lines are powerful tools to understand the physical conditions in galaxies from the local universe to distant cosmological objects .",
    "figure 2 shows the critical density ( i.e. the density for which the rates of collisional and radiative de - excitation are equal ) of each line as a function of the ionization potential of its ionic species , in three different redshift ranges , one for each frame , for which the rest - frame wavelength of the line is shifted in the far - infrared range .",
    "this diagram shows how these lines can measure two fundamental physical quantities ( density and ionization ) of the gas . in the figure",
    "are shown with different symbols the lines originated in different astrophysical emission regions at work in galaxies : the photodissociation regions ( pdr ) , the stellar ionization in hii / starburst regions , the agn ionization and the high ionization of coronal type emission . choosing two lines along the abscissa and two along the ordinate , their ratios give , respectively , a good estimate of the ionization and the density of the gas in the region ( see , e.g. , spinoglio & malkan 1992 ) .",
    "m range at three different redshift ranges ( the rest wavelength is reported near each line label ) .",
    "the lines are plotted as a function of the ionization potential and their critical density .",
    "different symbols are used for the lines from the photodissociation regions ( pdr ) , shown as squares , the stellar / hii region lines , shown as triangles , the agn lines , depicted with circles and the coronal lines , indicated with stars .",
    "the two [ oi ] lines have been plotted - for graphical reasons - at a ionization potential higher than their zero value.,width=453 ]    it appears from the figure that in the far - ir range , spectroscopy of the fine structure lines can probe in the local universe the two regimes of photodissociation ( pdr ) and stellar ionization .",
    "the stellar emission ( e.g. in starburst galaxies ) can be probed up to high z , using many lines in the rest - frame spectral range of 3 @xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath5 30 .",
    "the ionization from agn can be probed in the redshift range 1@xmath5z@xmath55 and the coronal emission regions are probed by near - ir lines shifted into the far - ir at a redshift of z @xmath9 5 .",
    "the iso spectrometers detected in the bright local seyfert type 2 galaxy , ngc1068 , many of the lines plotted in fig.2 at flux levels of 5 - 200 @xmath10 10@xmath11 w m@xmath12 ( alexander et al 2000 , spinoglio et al 2005 ) .",
    "this object contains both an active nucleus and a starburst . considering this galaxy as a template object ,",
    "we computed the line intensities expected at redshifts ranging from 0.1 to 5 . for simplicity",
    ", we adopted an einstein - de sitter model universe , with @xmath13 = @xmath14 and @xmath15= 1 , h@xmath16=75 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 .",
    "the luminosity distances have been derived using : @xmath18\\ ] ]    the results are reported in table 1 , where the line intensities are given in w m@xmath12 .",
    "we have assumed that the line luminosities scale as the bolometric luminosity and we have chosen two cases : + a ) a luminosity evolution proportional to the ( z+1)@xmath19 , consistent with the _ spitzer _ results at least up to redshift z=2 ( perez - gonzalez et al 2005 ) ( a values in the table ) ; + b ) no luminosity evolution ( b values in the table ) .    because the star formation process in galaxies was much more enhanced at z=1 - 2 than today , we consider reasonable to adopt the model with strong evolution ( model a ) for the stellar / hii region lines and the `` no evolution '' one ( model b ) for the agn lines .",
    "we note that the dependence on different cosmological models is not very strong . the popular model with @xmath15= 0.27 , @xmath20=0.73 , h@xmath16=71 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 shows greater dilutions , increasing with z , by factors of 1.5 for z=0.5 to 2.5 for z=5 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      * notes * : for each transition in each column , the first line gives the observed intensity of ngc1068 , the other lines list for the given redshift the predicted intensity value for models a ( top value ) and b ( bottom value ) .",
    "the blank values correspond to observed wavelengths outside the esi - spica range @xmath930 - 200@xmath2 m .",
    "primordial stars are born in a universe which was very poor in metals , for this reason they should form in very massive clouds which are expected to originate in very massive clusters populated by a large number of massive stars . following the suggestion by panagia ( 2005 ) to detect the primordial stars though their hii regions nebular emission , we modeled the emission of primordial clusters using the model stellar atmosphere by schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) and a standard photoionization model .",
    "we have used a stellar model with mass m=120 m@xmath21 ( the largest value of the mass among the models by schaerer & de koter ) , effective temperature t@xmath22= 53,400k , luminosity l=2 @xmath10 10@xmath23 l@xmath21 , and radius r=15.6 r@xmath21 .",
    "we computed the spectrum of an hii region originated from this star , using the cloudy v96 photoionization code with the following parameters : internal radius r(int)=0.1pc , external radius r(ext)=2.5pc , metallicity of 10@xmath24 z@xmath21 , hydrogen density of 10@xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "we found that to obtain flux densities comparable to the spectroscopic detection limit of jwst , about 10@xmath27 stars are needed in the cluster .",
    "we present in fig.3 the synthetic spectrum of such a cluster at a redshift of z=15 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that such clusters , if they existed in the primordial universe , can be detected through hydrogen and helium recombination lines by jwst in the mid - ir ( e.g. in the ly@xmath28 , h@xmath28 , he i 1.08@xmath2 m lines ) and by spica in the far - ir ( e.g. in the pa@xmath28 and br@xmath28 lines ) .",
    "the lines that can be observed in the far - ir are better than the ly@xmath28 line , because this latter can be severely absorbed by the dust , which could be present in the hii region , if one allows moderate metallicities of the order of 10@xmath29 z@xmath21 ( panagia 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , the ly@xmath28 line can also be absorbed by hi in the intergalactic medium ( miralda - escude & rees 1998 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of a mid - to - far - ir spectrometer onboard of spica should be better than that one of jwst , at wavelenths larger than 10 @xmath2 m , because it will not be limited by the thermal background of the mirror .",
    "we conclude that the estimated number of members of the cluster can well decrease by a factor 10 , to the value of 10@xmath30 stars , if we consider stars with a larger mass , e.g. of the order of 150 - 200 m@xmath21 , for which reliable models are not available .",

    "flux is scaled at earth .",
