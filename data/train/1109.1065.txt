    "with the motivation described above , we now move on to describe a model in 1 + 1 dimensions that contains kinks and also allows for twist .",
    "we start with the o(3 ) sigma model given by the action @xmath1 where @xmath2 satisfies the constraint @xmath3 this model is known to be completely integrable @xcite and we will need to spoil this feature .",

    "the @xmath19 equation is satisfied provided @xmath39 .",
    "this can be arranged by choosing @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath42 , the solution is `` spinning '' in field space . in this case",
    ", @xmath22 can be any static solution of the sine - gordon model , in particular , it can be the sine - gordon kink .",
    "this solution can be pictured on the two - sphere as lying on a line of longitude that spins with angular frequency @xmath43 .",
    "the feature that our model has sine - gordon subspaces is advantageous becase breathers are non - dissipative solutions in the model",
    ". thus we can formulate non - dissipative initial conditions by writing them in terms of a sequence of breathers . in the quantized sine - gordon model",
    ", the smallest breather corresponds to a particle , and hence , a sequence of classical breathers is the closest we can come classically to a sequence of quantum particles @xcite .",
    "we first study the scattering of two breathers and find the time delay in the scattering . in the untwisted case , this is well - defined because the breathers pass through each other . in the twisted case ,",
    "the breathers get deformed on interaction .",
    "however , we can still calculate the time delay in the propagation of the center of energy .",

    "this will only happen for @xmath68 when the dynamics is sine - gordon .",

    "these two solutions are related by the @xmath8 symmetry under @xmath9 . in this model",
    ", we do not have a `` twist '' degree of freedom as in the kink case . recall that in the kink case , we had a 1-parameter family of kink solutions labeled by the constant value of the azimuthal field @xmath19 as in eq .",
    "( [ kinksolution ] ) .",
    "similarly we need a one parameter family of vortex solutions and this can be obtained by extending the model to o(4 )",
    ". then the vacua are still given by circles @xmath94 but there is a one parameter family of possible vortex solutions labeled by the angle in the @xmath95 plane .",
    "a point to remember about vortices is that the energy of a global vortex - antivortex pair grows logarithmically with separation .",
    "so their creation is necessarily transient , unless the model is gauged .",
    "a similar comment applies to the creation of magnetic monopoles .    to study monopole formation in 3 + 1 dimensions in our o(3 ) model",
    "we would choose the potential , @xmath96 \\label{monopolepotential}\\ ] ] except that this vanishes due to the constraint .",
    "the o(3 ) model does have the correct topology ( @xmath97 ) for magnetic monopoles , but the monopoles are singular because there is no escape from the vacuum manifold . if we choose the potential in eq .",
    "( [ monopolepotential ] ) but in an o(4 ) model , we get a situation similar to the vortex discussed above in the o(3 ) model : there are two non - singular monopole solutions corresponding to the two `` hemispheres '' in @xmath98 . to include a twist similar to the one for kinks , we should go to at least an o(5 ) model , where the one parameter family of monopole solutions is labeled by the angle in the @xmath99 plane .",
    "however , monopoles can be relatively twisted even in the o(3 ) model and we now discuss this feature in greater detail .",
    "let us assume that a monopole is located at @xmath100 and its asymptotic vector field @xmath7 is given by eq .",
    "( [ nthetaphi ] ) with @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the spherical angle measured from the @xmath103axis but with the origin of the coordinate system at @xmath100 .",

    "the azimuthal angle @xmath108 and @xmath109 plays the role of the twist in the o(3 ) model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite taubes used a morse theory construction in the gauged o(3 ) model and proved the existence of a static solution consisting of a monopole and an antimonopole ( @xmath110 ) separated by some distance .",
    "this is surprising because one expects the coulombic @xmath111 attractive force between the @xmath110 ) to bring them together , after which the two can annihilate . in taubes solution ,",
    "the @xmath110 are kept apart by a repulsive force provided by the `` twist '' .",
    "the result is an unstable solution since the monopoles can untwist , come together , and annihilate .",
    "the solution itself is quite complicated but has been found numerically in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a construction similar to the one used by taubes exists in the electroweak model and the resulting @xmath110 solution is called the `` sphaleron '' @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the form of the sphaleron solution is spherically symmetric for a particular value of coupling constants and is known explicitly up to two simple profile functions given by ordinary second order differential equations .",
    "the solution has been studied numerically for a large range of coupling constants @xcite .",
    "a particularly convenient feature of the morse theory construction , is that it provides a path from the @xmath110 solution to the vacuum .",
    "thus the sphaleron decay path describes the annihilation of a twisted @xmath110 pair . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the decay products of the annihilation include electromagnetic fields with non - zero magnetic helicity , which is defined as @xmath112 the magnetic helicity , which measures the twisting and linking of magnetic field lines , is inherited from the initial twist in the @xmath110 pair that make up the sphaleron .",
    "the sphaleron decay analysis also shows that , after a short period of time , the evolution of the electroweak fields is such that magnetic helicity is conserved .    by a time reversal of the sphaleron decay process ,",
    "we conclude that the _ convergence _ of electromagnetic helicity can possibly lead to the creation of sphalerons , and hence also @xmath110 with a relative twist .",
    "the twist may also provide the necessary repulsive force between monopoles and antimonoples so as to separate them and to prevent them from re - annihilating .",
    "the usefulness of magnetic helicity may be conjectured based on another line of reasoning . in highly conducting plasmas",
    "it is known that magnetic helicity is a conserved quantity .",
    "the derivation goes as follows : @xmath113",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\int d^3x   \\left [ ( { \\bf e}+{\\bf \\nabla}a^0 ) \\cdot { \\bf b }               - { \\bf a } \\cdot { \\bf \\nabla}\\times { \\bf e } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int d^3x   \\left [ 2 { \\bf e}\\cdot { \\bf b }               + ( { \\bf \\nabla } a^0 ) \\cdot { \\bf b } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\          & = & \\int d^3 x \\left [ 2{\\bf e}\\cdot { \\bf b }                 - { a^0 } { \\bf \\nabla}\\cdot { \\bf b } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\          & = & 2 \\int d^3 x \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\bf j}{\\sigma }                 + { \\bf v}\\times { \\bf b } \\right ) \\cdot { \\bf b } ] \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & \\to & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last two steps we have used ohm s law as applied to a plasma element moving with velocity @xmath114 .",
    "the electrical conductivity is assumed to be infinite , @xmath115 , though there are arguments in support of helicity conservation even if @xmath116 is finite but large .",
    "crucially for us , in the second and fifth steps , we have had to assume the absence of magnetic monopoles and magnetic currents .",
    "hence magnetic helicity is conserved in a highly conducting plasma provided there are no magnetic monopoles",
    ". then we might expect that if magnetic helicity is externally driven to large values in a plasma of extremely high electrical conductivity , magnetic monopoles might be produced to cause the helicity to dissipate .",
    "our comments above also apply to the creation of sphalerons in the electroweak model since the sphaleron is precisely a bound state of an electroweak monopole and antimonopole .",
    "the monopole pair in the sphaleron are confined by a z - string @xcite and can not escape .",
    "hence , if a sphaleron is produced , it will later decay .",
    "the production and decay of a sphaleron can lead to baryon number violation .",
    "so the discussion above suggests that it may be possible to observe baryon number violation by focusing magnetic helicity in a dense plasma .    while we are still speculating , it is possible that the magnetic field of certain atomic nuclei contain non - trivial magnetic helicity : since magnetic helicity violates parity , the lightest stable candidate nuclei are @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the scattering of a large number of such nuclei , @xmath119 based on energy requirements , seems like a possible path to concentrate magnetic helicity in a small spatial volume , perhaps sufficient to form a sphaleron .",
    "one way to investigate this process theoretically would be to use the description of nuclei in terms of skyrmions . to study the feasibility of baryon number violation in the collision of `` helical nuclei ''",
    ", we would need to couple the skyrmion fields to electroweak gauge fields , then consider the scattering of corresponding `` helical skyrmions '' in an attempt to find in - states that lead to sphaleron production , and thus baryon number violation .    to conclude",
    ", we have studied the creation of solitons in a model that contains a twist degree of freedom in addition to the ones that are used for building the soliton . in our model in sec .",
    "[ o3model ] , twist is an essential ingredient for the production of solitons because the dynamics in the zero twist sector is completely integrable .",
    "we have explicitly shown a range of parameters that lead to soliton creation .",
    "we have also discussed some applications of these ideas to the production of vortices and monopoles , and baryon number violation via the production of electroweak sphalerons .",
    "i am grateful to gil speyer , pascal vaudrevange , and amit yadav for numerical help , and to andrei belitsky , rich lebed , and juan maldacena for discussions .",
    "the numerical work was done on the cluster at the asu advanced computing center .",
    "i also thank the institute for advanced study for hospitality and the department of energy for grant support at asu .",
    "the most straightforward approach to solving the equations of motion is to use spherical coordinates as in eqs .",
    "( [ thetaeq ] ) , ( [ phieq ] ) .",
    "the issue there is that spherical coordinates are not globally well - defined and one must use two different patches , say , @xmath120 with respect to the @xmath6axis and @xmath121 with respect to the @xmath122axis . if @xmath123 becomes small , we can solve the evolution equation in terms of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and then transform to @xmath123 and @xmath126 .",
    "we found that this scheme introduced unacceptable numerical errors in the boundary region of the two patches and we decided not to pursue this scheme .",
    "instead we decided to work with the vector representation ( @xmath127 ) where the equation of motion can be written in first order form as @xmath128{\\vec n }            - n_3 ( n_3{\\vec n}-{\\vec e}_3)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we evolved these equations using the explicit second order crank - nicholson method with two iterations @xcite .",
    "we also implemented boundary conditions , though in practice our lattice was large enough that the boundaries were irrelevant .",
    "the issue now is that when we discretize the above equations , they do not preserve the condition @xmath12 and the orthogonality condition @xmath129 . to remedy this , we enforced these constraints at every time step by rescaling @xmath127 so as to get a unit vector , and by subtracting out from @xmath130 the component parallel to @xmath7 .",
    "to our satisfaction , this procedure conserved energy at the percent level and the evolution also remained stable .",
