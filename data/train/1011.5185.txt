    "although a large number of physical systems admit studies of their basic properties using different types of time - independent formalisms , in many important cases one has to explicitly take into account the time dependence and to apply the appropriate approach , i.e.  one of available time - dependent analytical or numerical methods .",
    "this has to be done even for systems with time - independent potentials if their dynamical properties and time evolution is studied .",
    "however , for describing systems in genuinely time - dependent external potentials or for rotating systems , using of such approaches is always necessary .",
    "this applies equally to classical and quantum systems , and various methods have been developed to address relevant physical problems . for quantum systems a number of general methods is available , ranging from time - dependent perturbation theory and variational perturbation theory , to specialized approaches such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , and the density matrix functional theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to these generic schemes , several specific numerical methods have been developed for enabling a quantitative description of quantum systems that have attracted a significant research interest .",
    "this includes studies of ultra - cold quantum gases @xcite and optical lattices @xcite , whose comprehensive and highly tunable features make them an important example of feynman s quantum simulator @xcite . in such numerical approaches",
    "@xcite usually a second - order algorithm in the propagation time is used , which is basically the same as in the time - independent case . however ,",
    "also higher order schemes have been derived , including fourth @xcite and higher - order expansions @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to develop a formalism which enables a systematic improvement in the convergence order of numerical algorithms for general time - dependent quantum systems . in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have extended the earlier established approach @xcite for obtaining a high - order short - time expansion of transition amplitudes for time - independent potentials to the important time - dependent case . in that paper , we have first calculated a short - time expansion of a generic transition amplitude using the path integral formalism to fourth order in the propagation time , which has then served the important purpose : to introduce the proper functional form of the ansatz for the ideal discretized effective potential , as well as its short - time double series expansion in both the propagation time and the discretized velocity .",
    "using both the forward and backward schr \" odinger equation for transition amplitudes , we have then derived the appropriate equation for the ideal effective potential , which represents an important generalization of the equation derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the time - independent case . using the double series expansion ansatz for the effective potential ,",
    "we have been able to set up and solve recursive relations for the effective potential for one - dimensional systems , and to numerically verify that higher - order analytic approximative results for transition amplitudes obtained in this way , indeed , give the correct convergence order for a number of models .    in this paper",
    "we further develop and generalize the time - dependent approach introduced in ref .",

    "we briefly review the time - dependent effective action approach in the path - integral formalism of quantum mechanics @xcite , as well as the main results of our previous paper @xcite .",

    "[ sec:1dz ] we present another important extension of the time - dependent formalism , and set up a specific recursive relation for calculating diagonal transition amplitudes , which are necessary for a numeric high - precision calculation of partition functions . in this case , a simplified set of recursive relations is obtained , which is numerically verified for several model potentials .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : rt ] illustrates how the developed imaginary - time formalism can be transformed into a real - time one , and its applicability is numerically demonstrated by treating several models .",
    "we also show how the real - time evolution can be described using the time - dependent effective action approach , and how the associated numerical errors can be assessed and controlled in typical applications .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of the time - dependent effective action approach established in ref .",
    "this formalism considers a non - relativistic quantum multi - component system in @xmath0 spatial dimensions with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the number of particles in the system and the @xmath3 dimensional vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 contain positions and momenta of all particles , while the parenthetic subscript @xmath6 denotes the particle number .",
    "for such a system we consider the calculation of the transition amplitudes @xmath7 where the vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe the positions of all particles at the initial and final time @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the above transition amplitude is a coordinate - space matrix element of the evolution operator , which describes the propagation of the system ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and is defined by the time - ordered exponential @xmath12 in the path - integral formalism , the transition amplitude can be expressed by a coordinate - space path integral @xmath13\\right\\}\\ , , \\ ] ] where the integration is defined over all possible trajectories @xmath14 .",
    "this usually involves the discretization of the trajectories , which is usually performed by dividing the time evolution from @xmath10 to @xmath11 into @xmath15 equal time steps . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath16 denotes the action for a given trajectory @xmath14 : @xmath17=\\int_{t_a}^{t_b } dt\\ , \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf q}^2(t)-v(\\mathbf q(t ) , t)\\right\\}\\ , .\\ ] ] the common step at this point is to switch to the imaginary - time formalism , which is usually applied in numerical simulations @xcite , due to problems which may arise from the oscillatory nature of the integrand in the real - time approach .",
    "we will do so as well in the next two sections , but in sec .",
    "[ sec : rt ] we will switch the developed formalism back to the real time and demonstrate how it can be used for studying the dynamics and real - time evolution of quantum systems . after wick rotation to the imaginary time ,",
    "the transition amplitude in the path - integral formalism is expressed as @xmath18}\\ , , \\ ] ] where the minkowski action is now replaced by its imaginary - time counterpart , the euclidean action @xmath19=\\int_{t_a}^{t_b } dt\\ , \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf q}^2(t)+v(\\mathbf q(t ) , t)\\right\\}\\ , , \\ ] ] which is actually the energy functional for the system .    as was shown previously for time - independent potentials @xcite , as well as for the time - dependent ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exact imaginary - time transition amplitudes can be expressed in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the ideal discretized action and depends on the coordinate mid - point @xmath22 , the discretized velocity @xmath23 , the time interval @xmath24 , and the time mid - point @xmath25 .",
    "note that we have used the convention @xmath26 , and we have restricted ourselves to particles with unitary masses @xmath27 .",
    "the ideal discretized action further reads @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ideal discretized effective potential , which also depends on the time mid - point @xmath30 due to the explicit time dependence of the potential @xmath31 .",
    "this represents the major difference in the formalism compared to the previously developed one in ref .",
    "@xcite for the time - independent case .    in order to determine a partial differential equation for the ideal effective potential @xmath29 , we have derived in sec .",
    "4 of our previous paper @xcite the forward and the backward schrdinger equation for time derivatives of the transition amplitude with respect to the initial and final time , and have found that they obey @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for the coordinate - space hamilton operator @xmath34 , in which momentum and position operators are replaced by their coordinate - space representations at @xmath9 ( and similarly for @xmath35 ) .",
    "when we insert the ansatz ( [ eq : aexacta ] ) together with ( [ eq : aexactb ] ) into the equations ( [ eq : dtba ] ) and ( [ eq : dtaa ] ) , we obtain the corresponding partial differential equation for the effective potential in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "as expected , the form of this equation is the same as eq .",
    "( 29 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite , and if the potential @xmath31 does not depend on time , we immediately obtain the previously derived result .",
    "the above equation is the starting point for calculating the effective potential .",
    "naturally , it can be solved analytically only for exactly solvable models . however , if the propagation time is short , we can perform a short - time expansion of the effective potential and set up appropriate equations for the coefficients in this expansion . in our previous paper @xcite this",
    "was done for one - dimensional systems , and it was shown that we have to use a double expansion of the effective potential in both @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the propagation in the imaginary time is equivalent to diffusion , and therefore , on the average , we expect the diffusion relation @xmath42 to hold .",
    "this allows us to effectively couple the two expansion parameters and to establish a unique counting of powers in @xmath40 for all terms in the expansion for @xmath29 .",
    "however , if the diffusion relation is not applicable , the two expansions can be considered as independent , and the whole approach can still be applied , with an independent counting of powers in @xmath40 and in @xmath41 .    in the next section",
    "we will analytically derive a systematic short - time expansion of the effective potential @xmath29 for quantum many - body systems , which yields a significant improvement in the convergence of numerically calculated transition amplitudes and partition functions for systems in time - dependent potentials . as we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : aexactb ] ) , if the effective potential @xmath29 is calculated to order @xmath43 , we get the effective action correct to order @xmath44 . if we take into account the normalization factor in the expression ( [ eq : aexacta ] ) , the corresponding error in the calculation of the short - time amplitude is given by @xmath45 where subscript @xmath46 denotes that we use the effective action of that order in @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we see that the analytical calculation of higher - order effective actions is beneficial , since it provides an analytic approximation for transition amplitudes which yield high - precision results of the desired order in numerical calculations .",
    "now we focus on the development of the recursive formalism for calculating the effective potential for the case of a general multi - component non - relativistic quantum system of @xmath2 particles in @xmath0 dimensions by extending the one - dimensional calculations of sec .  5 in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "note that such a formalism is needed even for studies of single - particle systems in two or three spatial dimensions , which have more than one degree of freedom .",
    "for example , such time - independent many - body effective actions of level @xmath47 have already been used for a numerical study of fast - rotating bose - einstein condensates @xcite , as well as a high - precision calculation of the energy spectra and eigenfunctions of several two - dimensional models @xcite .",
    "the presented extension of the many - body formalism will allow studies of such systems in external time - dependent potentials , as well as the investigation of the formation and evolution of vortices @xcite and other dynamical phenomena .",
    "we also plan to study collective oscillation modes of bose - einstein condensates with a parametrically modulated interaction @xcite .    to develop the time - dependent many - body formalism , we solve the partial differential equation ( [ eq : weq ] ) for the effective potential @xmath29 by using a multi - dimensional many - particle generalization of the double power expansion used in eq .",
    "( 33 ) of our previous paper @xcite for one - component systems , which has the form @xmath48 here we have introduced the contractions @xmath49 @xmath50 in such a way that they correspond to the case of the time - independent potential @xcite . in the above relations we assume",
    "the einstein convention that summation over repeated indices is performed .",
    "introducing such contractions of tensorial coefficients",
    "@xmath51 significantly simplifies in this case the analytic derivation and also provides a key ingredient for implementing the many - body recursion relations in symbolic calculations using e.g. mathematica software package @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the task to explicitly symmetrize the coefficients would amount to a complexity of the algorithm which scales with the number of possible permutations @xmath52 and which would not be feasible even for a very moderate number of particles .",
    "using scalar quantities , which are obtained by contracting the coefficients with the discretized velocity @xmath41 , efficiently solves this problem .    the multiple - component version of the expression from the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : weq ] ) has the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents @xmath55-th partial derivative of the potential with respect to the time @xmath30 . after inserting the above expression into the partial differential equation ( [ eq : weq ] ) for the effective potential we straightforwardly obtain recursive relations for even- and odd - power contractions",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath58 the diagonal contractions can easily be calculated in a closed form as in the single - particle one - dimensional case , yielding @xmath59 thus , the recursion relations ( [ eq : receven ] ) and ( [ eq : recodd ] ) can be solved up to a given order @xmath46 together with ( [ eq : wmm ] ) and ( [ eq : wm12 m ] ) by using a similar procedure as before .",
    "here we give the solution up to order @xmath60 , which generalizes the previously given solution for the simple case @xmath61 , obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath62 we only have the naive @xmath63 term , i.e. @xmath64 while @xmath65 yields the first non - trivial even - power terms @xmath66 which are sufficient to construct @xmath67 effective action . the next term we calculate",
    "is the odd - power contraction for @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath68 which contains the explicit time derivative of @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath69 we obtain the next order of even - power terms : @xmath70 these terms , together with the previously calculated ones , are sufficient to construct level @xmath71 effective action . in order to be able to complete @xmath60 effective action derivation",

    "the obtained results automatically reduce to the already known effective actions for the time - independent potentials @xcite if we set all time - derivatives of the potential to zero . furthermore , the many - body results ( [ nai])([mbb ] ) reduce for the special case @xmath61 to the previous time - dependent results @xcite .",
    "the outlined procedure continues in the same way for higher levels @xmath46 .",
    "we have automatized this procedure and implemented it in our speedup code @xcite using the mathematica software package @xcite for symbolic calculus .    in order to numerically verify the developed expressions for the case of multi - component quantum systems",
    ", we will calculate transition amplitudes of a set of time - dependent harmonic oscillators , @xmath75 which represents the archetypical model for many physical phenomena .",
    "this exactly solvable model allows us to compare analytical expressions obtained from recursive relations and to verify that using level @xmath46 effective action leads to values of transition amplitudes which are correct up to order @xmath76 . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] for a system of @xmath77 time - dependent oscillators , the respective scaling is perfect .",
    "the middle and bottom plots illustrate another important feature of the short - time expansion for multi - component systems : as the number of components of the system @xmath78 increases , the exponent @xmath79 may become zero or negative for a given effective action level @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to the peculiar behavior observed in the middle and bottom plots for small values of @xmath46 , with the deviation of the amplitude being constant ( @xmath80 , @xmath63 in the middle plot , @xmath81 , @xmath67 in the bottom plot ) or even increasing ( @xmath81 , @xmath63 in the bottom plot ) when @xmath40 is decreased .",
    "thus , this prevents the calculation of the transition amplitude with high accuracy , which is , in principle , expected to be possible by decreasing @xmath40 .",

    "for instance , in typical experimental setups with ultracold quantum gases harmonic or anharmonic confining potentials are generically switched on and off , thus generating natural non - equilibrium situations .",
