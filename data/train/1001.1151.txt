    "in the last twenty years or so since the seminal paper @xcite of belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov , conformal field theory ( cft ) has proven amazingly successful .",
    "it is now an essential item in the toolbox of condensed matter and string theorists , and has had a profound impact on several sub - fields of modern mathematics .    yet , despite this flurry of successes , some very fundamental questions have remained unanswered to this day .",
    "one of these questions concerns percolation , the very geometrical critical problem where cft has obtained some of its most impressive results . in a nutshell , despite years of work and some progress ( see below ) , we do not know any conformal field theory describing at least some of the geometrical observables ( be it hulls , clusters or backbones ) in a fully consistent way . as a result , many quantities involving bulk correlations functions  for instance the equivalent of the binder cumulant @xcite in this problem @xcite ",
    "are , to this day , unknown analytically .",
    "another vexing question concerns the celebrated transition between plateaux in the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "the evidence is strong that it corresponds to quantum critical points of the 2 + 1 dimensional electron gas .",
    "the physics of the transition is somewhat well understood ( and involves an interplay between disorder , which tends to localize the electrons , and the kinetic energy , quenched by the strong magnetic field , which causes delocalization ) , and qualitatively well described by a 2d sigma model with topological term @xcite . nevertheless , a precise identification of the low energy effective field theory is still lacking to this day , despite the wealth of theoretical and numerical works on the topic , and the fact that this theory is expected to be conformally invariant ( see @xcite for an insightful review ) .",
    "the origin of these difficulties is , ultimately , the fact that the cfts describing these problems have to be non unitary , with vanishing central charge .",
    "non - unitarity in a cft can have rather mild consequences  like in the minimal theories such as the yang lee edge singularity .",
    "it took a while to realize that non - unitarity would most often ( in particular , when @xmath0 ) imply in fact indecomposability , leading to a very difficult kind of theory called a logarithmic cft ( lcft ) .",
    "lcfts were probably first encountered in published form in a paper by rozansky and saleur @xcite . in this paper",
    ", the authors studied a particular kind of @xmath0 theory with @xmath8 supergroup symmetry , and stumbled upon four - point functions involving logarithmic dependence on the cross ratio .",
    "these authors correctly related this property to the indecomposability of the operator product expansions ( ope ) , and to the non - diagonalizability of the @xmath7 generator , inherited from the non semi - simplicity of the symmetry algebra .",
    "shortly after , gurarie @xcite pointed out that these features were in fact necessary to have a consistent , non - trivial cft at @xmath0 .",
    "later , gurarie @xcite and gurarie and ludwig @xcite built up a very attractive formalism within which cfts at @xmath0 must possess , in addition to their stress energy tensor @xmath9 , an extra field whose holomorphic part , @xmath10 , has conformal weight two .",
    "the singular part of the ope between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is determined up to a new universal number , an `` anomaly '' usually denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter is expected in @xcite to play a very important physical role .",
    "it might obey a `` c - theorem '' @xcite and thus indicate possible directions of rg flows within theories with vanishing central charge .",
    "its value also dictates the existence of null vectors for conformal weights contained in the kac table , and is thus profoundly related with the determination of four - point functions .",
    "gurarie and ludwig @xcite suggested , based on knowledge of critical exponents from coulomb gas calculations and some heuristic hypotheses , that @xmath4 for polymers and @xmath5 for percolation . precisely below . ]    despite the appeal of the ideas proposed in @xcite , only very little progress has happened to make them into a powerful theoretical tool .",
    "it is not clear for instance to what extent it is possible or helpful to study further the extension of the virasoro algebra proposed in @xcite .",
    "considerable difficulties also arise when one tries to build non - chiral theories by combining the left and right moving sectors .",
    "most examples worked out so far indeed concern only boundary lcfts .    meanwhile",
    ", the subject has matured with the understanding that , probably , rather than a single parameter @xmath1 , lcfts might be characterized by a complicated structure of indecomposable virasoro modules .",
    "this structure involves maps between sub - modules , and several parameters to describe their precise action .",
    "this line of thought shows how close the problem is to the theory of non semi - simple lie ( super)algebras , whose representation theory is more often than not of the `` wild '' type .",
    "progress has been steady in trying to understand indecomposable virasoro modules @xcite in general lcfts . for @xmath0",
    "the @xmath1 parameters appear indeed as some particular coefficient describing the embedding of a sub - module .",
    "some simple algebraic arguments suggest then that @xmath4 for percolation and @xmath5 for polymers , that is , the value of gurarie and ludwig @xcite _ up to a switch_.    in the last two years , more progress has occurred from the direction of lattice models .",
    "it had long been known that the representation theory of lattice algebras ( mostly , the temperley - lieb algebra ) bore some striking resemblance to that of the virasoro algebra .",
    "in particular , it had been known that when @xmath11 is a root of unity , the hamiltonian ( the lattice discretization of @xmath7 , or @xmath12 depending on the boundary conditions ) can sometimes be non - diagonalizable , and that jordan cells appear , very much mimicking the ones expected in the continuum limit .",
    "this was explored in a much more systematic fashion in works by pearce , rasmussen and zuber @xcite and independently by read and saleur @xcite .",
    "the outcome of these analyses was a rather coherent picture of the indecomposable virasoro modules appearing in some families of boundary lcfts , including percolation and polymers , together with some formal but potentially useful results about fusion .",
    "this picture was interpreted in interesting mathematical terms in @xcite .    yet ,",
    "large parts of these constructions are still speculative .",
    "for instance , the lattice analysis clearly shows which modules are mapped into each other under the action of the lattice algebras , but what this becomes precisely in the continuum limit  including which virasoro generators and states are involved in these mappings , together with precise values of the corresponding coefficients  is largely conjectural .",
    "moreover , it is clear that only the ` simplest indecomposable ' modules have been encountered so far , and one is still far from being able to guess what would happen , say , for the quantum hall plateau transition .",
    "one of the crucial remaining obstacles is that the features that make lcfts difficult are also very hard to observe or measure directly .",
    "it is quite striking for instance , that despite the 15 year old controversy around the value of the @xmath1 parameter for percolation or polymers  problems which are usually rather easy to study numerically  no way to measure this parameter has been available , up to now .",
    "one of the only forays in this direction is the paper by koo and saleur @xcite , who attempted to define and study a straightforward regularization of the virasoro algebra on the lattice .",
    "their success was only partial , and hampered by the fact that the continuum limit of commutators is not the commutator of the continuum limits .",
    "we shall report in this paper a method to measure the parameter @xmath1 in lattice models . while it might not be general enough to work for all theories at @xmath0 , it certainly will allow us to assert what the values of this parameter for percolation and polymers actually are .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section , we recall basic facts about the @xmath1 number in lcfts at @xmath0 , and define a general strategy to measure it .",
    "this strategy requires overcoming two difficulties .",
    "one is finding a scalar product on the lattice that goes to the virasoro - shapovalov form in the continuum limit .",
    "the other is finding a regularization of the @xmath13 operator  or more precisely , of its action on the vacuum .",
    "these difficulties are solved in the next two sections . in section 4 ,",
    "we finally gather all the pieces to study the jordan cells for percolation and polymers , and measure @xmath1 .",
    "in a nutshell , the argument of gurarie @xcite went as follows .",
    "conformal invariance fixes the coefficient of the stress tensor @xmath3 in the ope of an operator with itself ( assuming there is a single field with @xmath14 ) to be of the form @xmath15 here @xmath16 is an amplitude , determining the normalization of the two - point function @xmath17 if one want to keep @xmath16 finite in a theory at @xmath0 for an operator with @xmath18 , the @xmath19 factor poses problems as it diverges .",
    "there are various ways to resolve the difficulty ( this was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "first , a divergence in the ope coefficient ( which would manifest itself in a physical quantity such as a four point function ) might not be a problem after all , but have a physical meaning , related with some @xmath20 limit .",
    "second , it could be that demanding @xmath16 finite is not physically meaningful , again in relation with an @xmath20 limit .",
    "recall that since we are dealing with non - unitary theories , having a vanishing two - point function does not mean that the corresponding operator is zero . the third way to resolve",
    "the difficulty is to admit that there are other operators with @xmath21 appearing on the right - hand side of the ope ( [ phiphiope ] ) .",
    "these operators might be part of a supersymmetry multiplet , such as those that might occur in supergroup wzw models @xcite and other supersymmetric cfts @xcite .",
    "we note that in such cases , there is no need for a logarithmic dependence in the ope at this order , although the theory will in general be logarithmic ( see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the other scenario proposed in @xcite is of an @xmath20 limit , with another operator whose dimension is generically different from 2 becoming degenerate with @xmath3 . in this case ",
    "examples of which can be worked out in details for the models with central charge @xmath22 , in the limit @xmath23one expects the ope of @xmath24 with itself to read instead @xmath25+\\ldots\\right ) \\,.\\ ] ] the operator @xmath2 is called ` logarithmic partner ' of @xmath3 , and forms with it a logarithmic pair , that is , a set of fields on which the @xmath7 operator is not diagonalizable but has the form of a jordan cell @xmath26 in terms of two - point functions one has    @xmath27    [ corrf ]    where the last result comes from imposing global conformal invariance @xcite . note that the _ normalization _ of @xmath3 is crucial in defining the numerical value of @xmath1 , once a choice has been made that the @xmath7 jordan cell has off - diagonal term unity ( which translates into the relative normalization of the last two equations ) .",
    "there remains , on the other hand , a choice @xmath28 , which does not affect the leading terms in the ope , but only the constant @xmath29 .",
    "the universality of these opes , the value of the number @xmath1 and its properties ( e.g. , under rg flows ) have all been subject of intense debate .",
    "it is not our purpose to review this debate in detail .",
    "we only wish to recall that , when thinking of the limit of minimal models as @xmath30 , one is naturally led to two candidates which might become degenerate with @xmath3 : the @xmath31 field and the @xmath32 field ( in kac table notations ) .",
    "the former choice leads to @xmath5 , and the latter to @xmath4 . using a variety of arguments , gurarie and",
    "ludwig @xcite predicted that the former choice corresponds to percolation , and the latter to polymers , which are therefore profoundly different logarithmic cfts .    while one can dwell at great length on the merits of the arguments in @xcite we believe it is more constructive to ask whether one can , in fact , measure the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "some considerable difficulties arise when thinking of this possibility .",
    "one might , of course , try to identify @xmath2 in a lattice model of percolation or polymers .",
    "after all , it is quite possible to get a handle on the meaning of @xmath3 itself @xcite . but",
    "measuring directly correlation functions such as those in ( [ corrf ] ) is a very daunting task , not to mention the difficulty of extracting properly a logarithmic dependence .",
    "we also note that the formalism in @xcite is really a chiral one , where the job of glueing back together the left and right parts of the theory is left for further work , and might lead to considerable surprises .",
    "this chiral aspect naturally suggests turning to the physics of the boundary theory , which is in fact what is mostly considered in @xcite .",
    "short of measuring correlation functions on the lattice , the next best hope would be to access numerically @xmath1 through a lattice analog of the jordan cell structure in ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "some progress in reproducing algebraic relations  e.g . , the virasoro commutation relations  in lattice models was reported in fact in @xcite , and it is a natural idea to try to push further the results obtained there .",
    "introduce first the scalar product and the notion of adjoint from in and out states as usual @xcite , with @xmath34 ( of course now the form is not positive definite ) .",
    "then the relations equivalent to ( [ corrf ] ) are @xmath35 in the basis @xmath36 , where @xmath37",
    "we see that a possible strategy to measure @xmath1 would involve finding a jordan cell for the hamiltonian ( the lattice version of @xmath7 ) in finite size .",
    "one would then have to identify the states corresponding to @xmath38 and normalize them properly .",
    "finally one would have to calculate the scalar product @xmath39 .",
    "we shall accomplish this program here , but first let us stress why it is difficult , and has not been done before .",
    "the first obstacle is to find a jordan cell in lattice models .",
    "this in fact is quite easy , as has been known for a while .",
    "the point is that the ` hamiltonians ' in lattice models whose continuum limit is a cft are often non - diagonalizable , a consequence of their deep relationship with lattice symmetries ( quantum groups ) or lattice algebras ( temperley - lieb algebras ) which have non semi - simplicity properties fully emulating those of the continuum limit .",
    "nevertheless , the question whether there exists a jordan cell for @xmath7 in a given lattice model is not easily answered a priori  we shall mention some surprises along these lines later .    having obtained the jordan cell , one needs to identify @xmath3 .",
    "while it is natural to think that @xmath3 is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian , a very important obstacle is its normalization . while crucial to determine the value of @xmath1",
    ", it can not be done via a standard eigenvector normalization since the two - point function of @xmath3 vanishes in the continuum , which manifests itself by the fact that @xmath40or rather its lattice equivalent  is a null state . to normalize @xmath3",
    ", we shall resort to a very indirect trick that we call the `` trousers trick '' , which is really at the heart of our solution of the problem .",
    "finally , one needs to properly normalize @xmath2 via the desired jordan cell structure .",
    "this is quite involved with big transfer matrices , and requires some numerical tricks .",
    "we note in passing that , according to ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 turns out to have infinite norm square .",
    "a 2d classical statistical model can be viewed as a 1 + 1d model evolving in imaginary time . at large length scales ,",
    "the low - energy excitations of the latter are described by some quantum field theory .",
    "when the 2d model is at a critical point , these excitations are gapless , hence the field theory becomes conformal .",
    "a 1 + 1d system of width @xmath43 is defined by its hamiltonian @xmath44 , or by its transfer matrix @xmath45 when it comes from a 2d statistical model .",
    "let us start by considering the ising model as an example .",
    "the critical ising chain is defined by the hamiltonian ( say with periodic boundary conditions @xmath46 ) @xmath47 acting on the space of spin configurations @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath44 is hermitian , therefore in the continuum limit is described by a unitary cft .",
    "it is well - known that it corresponds to the minimal model @xmath49 with central charge @xmath50 .",
    "now , our second example will turn out to be non - unitary .",

    "the case @xmath184 is similar , although the chain is too short to see the generic structure at @xmath362 - one gets only three simple representations instead of the four ones forming a diamond , as illustrated at the end of the previous section .    in the continuum limit",
    ", it is expected that the diamond goes over a to diamond representation of the virasoro algebra such as those in @xcite @xmath369 here , @xmath370 corresponds to an irreducible of virasoro with character @xmath371 . in the @xmath171 spin chain ( the situation would be similar in the susy case ) there are more multiplicities associated with the extra symmetry .",
    "what this means is discussed in @xcite .",
    "now the point is that the diamond modules do not necessarily have to appear .",
    "in fact , in the diagram representation , they do not , at least for values up to @xmath372 . in this case",
    ", there is no extra multiplicity due to the spin degrees of freedom , and what one gets is a collection of indecomposable standards with no action of temperley - lieb between them .",
    "this is represented schematically by the red dots and arrows in fig .",
    "[ structure ] .    in the dilute polymer case ,",
    "a similar discussion is possible , involving the dilute temperley lieb algebra and related geometrical representation , vertex model and spin chain .",
    "the decomposition of the hilbert space for the latter is given in @xcite and is qualitatively similar to fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "what happens now is that , in the geometrical transfer matrix , one already sees the diamonds , in contrast with the percolation case .",
    "our findings might have important consequences for the theory in @xcite , although one should be careful in jumping to conclusions .",
    "after all , @xmath1 was introduced and its value conjectured within a discussion of the chiral sector of bulk properties , and this may not extend straightforwardly to the structure of virasoro representations observed in the boundary case .",
    "it is meanwhile a bit surprising that we do not found a jordan cell for geometrical percolation .",
    "we are not sure how this affects the results in @xcite .",
    "we however note that polymers and percolation are a bit different when considered from the @xmath20 resp .",
