    "inflation , a sudden exponential expansion which occurred for a brief period in the very early stage of the universe , is the highly considered scenario to overcome some of the shortcomings of the standard model of cosmology .",
    "there exist a large number of inflation models by now which include single as well as multi field inflation models @xcite .",
    "all the models may agree that quantum fluctuations during inflation led to the scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "the scalar perturbations represent the density fluctuations which seeded the galaxy formation in the universe that we observe today , while the tensor perturbations represent primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "the primordial gws were generated during the inflation by strong and variable gravitational field of early universe via a mechanism known as parametric amplification of the zero - point quantum fluctuations which transforms the initial vacuum state with no particle into a multi - particle quantum state @xcite , called squeezed vacuum state @xcite .",
    "therefore the primordial gws are supposed to be found in the squeezed vacuum state @xcite .",
    "further , it is believed that the tensor fluctuations have left their own signatures on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "hence the squeezing effect may also be expected to reflect on the bb - mode correlation angular power spectrum of cmb @xcite .",
    "single field slow - roll inflation predicts almost gaussian distribution of adiabatic density perturbations with an almost scale invariant spectrum , whereas multi field inflation generate non - adiabatic perturbations giving rise to non - gaussianity .",
    "according to the recent results from planck mission the `` primordial non - gaussianity is small '' @xcite which tempts to conclude that single field inflation models are favorable over multi field .",
    "however , one of the attempts @xcite to explain the hemispherical asymmetry in the cmb sky , hinted by wmap @xcite and confirmed by planck 2013 and 2015 data @xcite , indicates that a single field slow roll inflation can not produce such an asymmetry without violating the homogeneity of the universe . at same time multi scalar field ( most probably inflaton and curvaton ) during inflation",
    "can produce such an asymmetry without violating the homogeneity @xcite .",
    "the goal of the paper is not study the gaussianity issue , however the aforementioned studies show that it is necessary to address and resolve the issue of single field or multi field of inflation with alternative approaches than the gaussianity or non - gaussianity test . therefore , the present work is aimed to explore whether the single field and multi field models of inflation issue can be resolved by considering the gws in the squeezed vacuum state and then its effect on the @xmath0 mode power spectrum of cmb with the bicep2/keck array and planck collaboration data @xcite .",
