    "it has long been clearly understood that the statement of the second law of thermodynamics concerning the increase in entropy in an isolated system as it goes to equilibrium refers only to the average behavior , but this was sufficient as long as one dealt only with macroscopic systems characterized by extremely narrow ensemble distributions with fluctuations that were essentially never observed .",
    "more recently , with the ability to quantitatively monitor systems on the extremely small scales of single molecules and quantum dots , it is possible to study fluctuations around the average behavior . _ fluctuation theorems _ that hold arbitrarily far from equilibrium have thus become subject to experimental verification  @xcite .",
    "these theorems in general deal with the ratio of the probabilities of a given system trajectory and that of its time reversed trajectory , either as the system goes to equilibrium or as it evolves to a steady state under the action of nonequilibrium constraints imposed on the system . from this one can calculate , for example , the relative probabilities that the entropy of an isolated system away from thermodynamic equilibrium will spontaneously increase or decrease over a given period of time .",
    "the ratio is essentially infinite in a macroscopic system away from equilibrium and is unity due to fluctuations in equilibrium , but in sufficiently small systems away from equilibrium it is merely large ( and experimentally accessible ) rather than infinite .",
    "fluctuation theorems can take different forms depending on the specific problem under consideration , but they are all ultimately connected to the probabilistic asymmetry of system trajectories and time reversed trajectories .",
    "equilibrium corresponds to the situation where the symmetry is restored as stated by the principle of microreversibility .",
    "fluctuation theorems have been formulated for a wide range of dynamics such as driven hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite , stochastic dynamics  @xcite , deterministic thermostated dynamics  @xcite , and even quantum dynamics  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on stochastic dynamics , in an effort to explore the validity of fluctuation theorems beyond the stochastic dynamics that have been considered to date .    in this narrower context of stochastic dynamics",
    ", most previous studies of fluctuation theorems have focused on systems described by markovian master equations or fokker - plank equations .",
    "recently there have been some efforts to investigate fluctuation theorems for systems described by nonlinear generalized langevin equations  @xcite with an external driving force as a nonequilibrium constraint .",
    "our focus is on nonequilibrium systems described by continuous time random walks ( ctrw )  @xcite in which transitions between microscopic states may be caused by more than one mechanism .",
    "the nonequilibirum constraint is imposed when these mechanisms have different statistical properties such as , for example , through contact with two heat baths maintained at different temperatures . in general , identifying such nonequilibrium constraints may itself be complicated  @xcite , and we will here explicitly point to these differences .",
    "we pose the following question : what properties of a ctrw are necessary for an entropy fluctuation theorem to be valid under such nonequilibrium constraints ? we note , for example , that ctrws are known to display aging @xcite as well as nonergodic phenomena @xcite which may significantly alter the behavior of the system under time reversal and prevent a fluctuation theorem from being satisfied . at the same time , ctrws under certain conditions reduce to markovian master equations which are known to satisfy fluctuation theorems .",
    "ctrws therefore provide a good framework to study the validity of fluctuation theorems .",
    "in particular , our results will hopefully contribute clarification to recent observations of anomalous statistics in the nonequilibrium fluctuations of single molecules and quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "a second purpose of this paper is the formulation of a general framework for the calculation of ( experimentally accessible ) counting statistics of events associated with a given mechanism .",
    "examples of such events might involve particle or energy transfer . to accomplish this we use a method based on the propagation of the generating function associated with the probability distribution of the events , in the spirit of the method used for markovian master equations  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to investigate the long - time behavior of the moments of the distribution associated with the counting statistics .",
    "our basic ctrw model is constructed as follows .",
    "we consider a stochastic dynamics between microscopic states @xmath9 of a system with a finite number of states .",
    "the transitions between states may be due to different mechanisms @xmath10 .",
    "for example , we will subsequently consider a system in which each microscopic state @xmath9 is characterized by a number @xmath11 of particles and an energy @xmath12 , and where the transitions between the @xmath9 s are triggered by different reservoirs ( heat baths ) @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that the system arrives at state @xmath13 at a given time and that its next jump is to state @xmath9 at a time @xmath14 later via mechanism @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution of waiting times ( wtd ) for this to occur is denoted by @xmath15 , with other related quantities specified in more detail subsequently .",
    "we focus on waiting time distributions whose long - time behavior is reflected in the small-@xmath16 laplace transform @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 are elements of an arbitrary matrix .",
    "a detailed discussion surrounding this choice can be found in  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 the long - time decay of the wtds is then of the power law form @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath1 the decay is at least as fast as @xmath22 but may be faster .    in sec .",
    "[ ctrw ] we present the ctrw model for an open system driven by different mechanisms described by different statistical properties , and formally express the probability that the system is in state @xmath9 at time @xmath14 . in sec .",

    "in particular , we show that fluctuation theorems for the entropy change can only be obtained if @xmath1 , that is , if the wtds decay at least as fast as @xmath2 at long times .",
    "furthermore , even in this case the entropy change can be expressed as a familiar ratio of the probability of a trajectory and its time reversed trajectory only if the wtds satisfy constraints of separability .",

    "the second is the average time that the system remains at @xmath13 without making any jumps at all by any mechanism .",
