    "where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the levi - civita connection and the ricci scalar associated with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . in these equations",
    "the indices are moved with the metric @xmath12 and its inverse @xmath13 .",
    "the manifold @xmath4 is called _ euclidean at infinity _ , if there exists a compact subset @xmath14 of @xmath4 such that @xmath15 is the disjoint union of a finite number of open sets @xmath16 , and each @xmath16 is isometric to the exterior of a ball in @xmath17 .",
    "each open set @xmath16 is called an _ end _ of @xmath4 .",

    "these fall off conditions ( see @xcite @xcite for the optimal fall off rates ) imply the existence of the total mass @xmath1 ( or adm mass @xcite ) defined at each end @xmath18 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes partial derivatives with respect to @xmath19 , @xmath25 is the euclidean sphere @xmath26 in @xmath18 , @xmath27 is its exterior unit normal and @xmath28 is the surface element with respect to the euclidean metric .    a central result concerning this physical quantity is the positive mass theorem @xcite @xcite : @xmath29 for asymptotically flat , complete , vacuum , data ; with equality only for flat data ( i.e ; the data for minkowski spacetime ) .",
    "we will further assume that the data are _ axially symmetric _",
    ", which means that there exists a killing vector field @xmath30 , i.e ; @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the lie derivative , which has complete periodic orbits and such that @xmath33    for axially symmetric data there exists another well defined physical quantity , namely the angular momentum @xmath2 associated with an arbitrary closed 2-surface @xmath34 in @xmath4 ( the komar integral of the killing vector @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",

    "if @xmath42 then it follows that @xmath43 for all @xmath34 . in order to have non zero @xmath2 the manifold @xmath4 must have a non trivial topology , for example @xmath4 can have more than one end .",

    ". then inequality holds .",
    "moreover , the equality in holds if and only if the data are a slice of the extreme kerr spacetime .    another way of stating this theorem is to say : _ extreme kerr initial data is the unique absolute minimum among all brill data set ( which satisfies condition [ cond ] ) with fixed angular momentum . _    let us discuss the hypotheses of this theorem .",
    "the first assumption is that the data belong to the brill class .",
    "this class of data is defined in section [ sec : brill - data ] , it involves certain technical restrictions on both the topology of the manifold and the behavior of the fields . as it was mentioned above , theorem [ t2 ]",
    "is expected to be true for general asymptotically flat , axisymmetric , vacuum , complete data .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the brill class is physically relevant in the following sense : it contains the kerr black hole data , it also contains non stationary data ( in particular small deviations from kerr ) and gravitational radiation is not constrained to be small in any sense . in section [ sec : brill - data ] we review a well known procedure for constructing a rich class of examples of this class of data set .",
    "the second assumption , condition [ cond ] , imply that the data have non trivial angular momentum only at one end .",

    "theorem [ t2 ] generalizes the results presented in @xcite @xcite in two ways .",
    "first , it does not involve any smallness assumptions on the norm of the fields .",
    "in particular , the data is not required to be close to extreme kerr data .",
    "second , the killing vector @xmath48 is not required to be hypersurface orthogonal .    theorem [ t2 ] will be a consequence of the following result in the calculus of variations .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the cylindrical radius in @xmath17 and @xmath50 the axis @xmath51 .",
    "define @xmath52 it is important to note that @xmath53 is an harmonic function in @xmath54 .",

    "however , we emphasize that theorem [ t2 ] is only valid for axially symmetric data ( see the remark after theorem [ t : brill ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that for the extreme kerr data the difference @xmath83 satisfies the hypothesis of theorem [ t1 ] ( see the appendix ) then inequality can be written in an equivalent form @xmath84 the function @xmath85 fixes the angular momentum of the data and it also fixes the origin of coordinates .    in theorem [ t1 ]",
    "we require the boundedness of the functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is possible to prove the same result without the assumption on @xmath86 and with a stronger assumption on @xmath88 , namely @xmath89 ( see a previous version of this article in @xcite ) .",
    "the disadvantage of this choice is that the function @xmath90 defined above does not satisfy this assumption : @xmath91 is not bounded at the origin . and",
    "hence , important examples as non - extreme kerr and the bowen - york data ( see section [ sec : brill - data ] ) are not included .",
    "also , without the assumption @xmath92 the proofs are more involved .",
    "nevertheless , i believe that for future generalization of theorem [ t1 ] these arguments which do not make use of the condition @xmath92 can be relevant .    in section [ sec : global - minimum ] we give an equivalent norm for the sobolev spaces @xmath64 and @xmath67 . in particular , this shows the equivalence between @xmath64 and the weighted sobolev spaces studied in @xcite .",

    "this is convenient for our purpose because we want to work always at one fixed end .",
    "the fall of conditions    imply that the metric is asymptotically flat at the end @xmath130 ( i.e , it satisfies the conditions given in @xcite @xcite ) . at the other ends , the fall off conditions ",
    "are more general , they include the standard asymptotically flat fall off and they also include the fall off of the extreme kerr initial data .    in a brill data set",
    "there are two geometrical scalar functions , the norm of the killing vector @xmath133 and the potential @xmath105 which is related to the twist of the killing vector ( also called the ernst potential @xcite ) .",
    "these scalars are well defined in the four dimensional spacetime which results as the evolution of the data .",
    "in contrast , the function @xmath110 depends on a choice of coordinates on the data .    the total mass is essentially contained in the @xmath134 part of the conformal factor @xmath110 , due to our assumption on @xmath111 .",
    "the angular momentum is determined by the potential @xmath105 in the following way .",

    "globally , we have assumed a particular topology on the compact core @xmath14 of the asymptotically flat manifold @xmath4 .",
    "also , we have assumed that the metric has globally the form .",
    "the fall off conditions for @xmath110 is a consequence of the standard definition of asymptotically flatness , however the fall off conditions for @xmath111 is an extra assumption .",

    "motivated by this problem , g. weinstein in a series of articles , @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , studied the dirichlet problem for harmonic maps with prescribed singularities of this type .",

    ", he defines the energy @xmath259 , with an appropriate harmonic function @xmath53 .",
    "this energy play a role of an auxiliary functional in order to `` regularize '' the singular energy @xmath251 of the harmonic map .",
    "the solution is a minimum of @xmath260 and the existence is proved with a direct variational method .",
    "our problem is related : we have a solution of  ( i.e , the extreme kerr solution given by  ) and we want to prove that it is a unique minimum of @xmath73",
    ". there exists , however , two important differences with weinstein work .",
    "the first one , which is a simplification , is that we do not want to prove existence of solution .",
    "we already have an explicit solution , we just want to prove that it is a minimum .",
    "the second difference , which introduces a difficulty , is that we deal with the _ extreme _ kerr solution .",
    "extreme means that @xmath261 , where @xmath1 is the mass and @xmath2 the angular momentum of the black hole , this definition can be also extended for multiple black holes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is a degenerate limit for black hole solutions , it is excluded in the hypotheses of weinstein existence theorems .",
    "hence , these results do not directly apply to our case .",
    "the extreme limit presents important peculiarities with respect to the non extreme cases .",
    "remarkably enough , in this case ( and only in this case ) the functional @xmath73 is the mass of the black hole ( see @xcite ) . in the non extreme cases ,",
    "the functional defined by weinstein is not the same as our definition , the choice of the harmonic function @xmath53 is different . in particular , if we take the extreme limit of the weinstein functional for one kerr black hole we get zero and not the total mass .",
    "perhaps , weinstein functional describes the interaction energy of multiple black holes and this is related to the non zero force between them .",
    "the existence of this force in the general case is an open question .",
    "this question is relevant for the black hole uniqueness problem with disconnected horizons .",
    "another peculiarity of the extreme case is that the relevant manifold is complete without boundary , in the non extreme case the manifold has an inner boundary : the horizon of the black hole ( there is no horizon in the extreme kerr black hole ) .    let us give the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "theorems [ t : ex ] and [ t : uniq ] establish that extreme kerr is the unique minimum in an annulus centered at the origin , with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the choice of the domain is important to avoid the singularity of the extreme kerr solution at the origin ( this is the main technical difference with the non extreme case ) .",
    "these two theorems are analogous to proposition 1 and proposition 3 of @xcite and use similar techniques .",
    "the main idea in the proof of theorem [ t : ex ] is the a priori bounds found by weinstein . in theorem [ t : gu ] we prove a uniqueness result for extreme kerr in the whole domain @xmath17 under appropriate decay conditions .",
    "this theorem is interesting by itself .",
    "finally , to prove theorem [ t1 ] , we cover @xmath17 with annulus and use a density argument together with the previous theorems .",
    "this argument will work because we know a priori the solution in @xmath17 .",
    "this is an important point , in this theorem we are not proving the existence of the extreme kerr solution .",
    "note that in @xcite , theorem 1 , it is proved the existence of solution for the non extreme cases , this proof requires the a priori bounds given by proposition 2 which are not valid in the extreme case .",
