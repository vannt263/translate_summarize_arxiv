    "the study of the physical properties of typical @xmath8 high - redshift galaxies has been limited by their faintness ( @xmath9 at @xmath10 ) , even for 8-/10-m class telescopes . over the past years the properties of these high - redshift galaxies",

    "although these techniques have been very successful , they require a large amount of observing time and only probe the average physical properties of these galaxies .",
    "another way to study in detail high - redshift galaxies is using the fortuitous alignments with foreground massive structures which provide natural magnification and associated amplification produced by strong gravitational lensing .",
