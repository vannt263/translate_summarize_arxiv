    "about half of the progenitor stars at the sun s galactocentric radius reside above the galactic h  disk @xcite . after they explode , their remnant bubbles will evolve in a relatively rarefied , dust - poor environment .",
    "they will expand to greater sizes , have lower interior pressures , lower luminosities , lose less energy via emission by dust grains , and live longer than disk remnants @xcite . at",
    "any given time , most of the supernova remnants ( snrs ) above the h  layer should be dynamically old , having transitioned from the adiabatic to the radiative phase in the first few percent of their lifetimes .",
    "old remnants should contribute to the o@xmath0  and soft x - ray backgrounds even though they are dim ( @xcite , hereafter papers i and ii ) .",
    "the young remnants should be much brighter and so easier to recognize .",
    "known examples of comparatively young extraplanar supernova remnants include sn1006 at @xmath11  pc @xcite and the lupus loop at @xmath12  pc @xcite .",
    "in addition , bright arcs in the _ rosat _  @xmath3  kev maps at @xmath13 and @xmath14 may also be extraplanar snrs .",
    "the plenitude of isolated snrs above the galactic h  layer raises the possibility that they play important roles in heating and ionizing the extraplanar interstellar medium ( ism ) and whets our appetite for more information .",
    "considering that snrs evolving in low density environments can be longlived , might they cover a large solid angle on the high latitude sky or fill a large fraction of the volume of space ?",
    "might they create many of the observed high latitude high - stage ions ( o@xmath0 , n@xmath1 , and c@xmath2 ) and soft x - rays ?",
    "considering that young snrs are both bright in soft x - rays and rich in o@xmath0  ions , do soft x - rays and o@xmath0  ions track each other in general , or only in recently shocked gas",
    "? how buoyant is the hot gas within snrs ?",
    "much progress has been made toward understanding these snrs .",
    "according to @xcite s and paper i s rough estimates , snrs fill a small fraction of the extraplanar volume , but cover a large fraction of the high latitude sky . ,",
    "but fractional volume occupation goes as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of objects and @xmath17 is the object s radius divided by the length scale of the available space , thus @xmath18 . ) ] paper i s preliminary estimate for the number of o@xmath0ions produced by the population of isolated , extraplanar snrs accounted for the extraplanar o@xmath0  observed by _ copernicus _",
    "@xcite and the supernova explosion scaleheight ( @xmath19  pc ) matched the observationally determined o@xmath0  scaleheight @xcite .",
    "subsequently , _ fuse _  observed a much larger sample of high @xmath20 stars and found more o@xmath0  above @xmath19  pc .",
    "these new observations suggest that modeling the vertical distribution of sn explosions may be important .",
    "_ fuse _  also found o@xmath0  moving away from the galactic plane at more than 100 km sec@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that buoyancy may be important .",
    "another possible sign of buoyant motion in the interstellar medium is an h  `` mushroom - shaped cloud '' , whose cap may be the squashed shell of a buoyant snr and whose stem may consist of trailing material @xcite .",
    "multidimensional simulations have been able to reproduce mushroom shapes and buoyant acceleration @xcite .",
    "could buoyancy explain the large o@xmath0  column densities and scale height ?",
    "if we could envision a map of the sky based on the o@xmath0  column density in extraplanar snrs , it would not look like a similarly constructed map of o@xmath0  resonance line emission , or , for that matter , like a similarly constructed map of soft x - ray emission .",
    "the o@xmath0  ions would be more smoothly distributed and cover greater area than the detectable emission .",
    "the reason is that snrs harbor rich stores of high - stage ions throughout their lives , but are bright emitters only during their early stages when the dense , recently shocked gas behind their shockfronts is hot @xcite .",
    "probably other types of hot gas structures behave similarly .",
    "this difference may explain the difficulty in matching the _ fuse _  o@xmath0  column density map @xcite with the _ rosat _  @xmath3 kev map @xcite .",
    "furthermore , extraplanar snrs are better emitters of @xmath3 kev photons than @xmath21 kev photons .",
    "thus , the more smoothly distributed @xmath21 kev emission @xcite can not be attributed to isolated snrs , even though some or all of the lumpy @xmath3  kev emission can ( paper ii , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper i and ii analyses were preliminary in the sense that they relied on simulations of snrs born at a single height above the plane and were meant to be followed by a suite of snr simulations .",
    "the @xcite project used the entire snr population rather than the population of isolated snrs above the milky way s thick disk .",
    "furthermore , their simulations did not include ambient magnetic pressure which can compress old snrs and therefore increase their uv and x - ray luminosities .",
    "consequently , these two studies predicted significantly different time and space average @xmath3  kev surface brightnesses .",
    "we resolve these difficulties in the present paper .    here",
    ", we aim to estimate the observable effects of the population of extraplanar snrs by simulating a suite of remnants at various heights above the galactic plane and various magnetic field strengths and explosion energies , allowing for buoyancy , and by multiplying by the expected rate of isolated supernova explosions above the galactic disk .",
    "the simulation package used to calculate the time evolution of isolated supernova remnants is described in detail in paper i and described briefly in subsection 2.1 .",
    "the analytic calculations used to predict the buoyant acceleration are spelled out in detail in subsection 2.2 .",
    "the ambient conditions and progenitor statistics are presented in subsections 2.3 and 2.4 . due to the interstellar medium",
    "s variation with height above the plane and due to the uncertainty in the explosion energy and ambient non - thermal pressure , we ran a suite of simulations .",
    "their parameters are presented in subsection 2.5 . the resulting area coverage , volume occupation , o@xmath0 , n@xmath1 , c@xmath2 , and soft x - ray predictions for each of the simulated snrs are tabulated in subsection 3.1 .",
    "we combined the individual snr predictions with the buoyancy calculations and convolved with the rate for isolated supernova explosions above the galactic disk s h  layer .",
    "the resulting estimates of the time and space averaged area coverage , volume occupation , high stage ion content and emission , and @xmath3  kev x - ray intensity due to the population of extraplanar snrs are presented and discussed in subsections 3.2 - 3.5 . in section 4 , we compare the estimates with o@xmath0  and @xmath3  kev x - ray observations .",
    "o@xmath0  and soft x - ray emission are far less affected by photoionization than are c@xmath2  and n@xmath1 , so are better tests on the model . the column densities from the calculations agree well with the o@xmath0  column densities observed within the first 2000  pc of the galactic plane .",
    "the simulations also explain much of the observed extraplanar @xmath3  kev x - ray emission outside of superbubbles and explain its mottled appearance .",
    "we summarize the results in section 5 .",
    "the supernova simulations are performed with a lagrangian mesh hydrocode whose algorithms model shock dynamics , nonequilibrium ionization and recombination , and nonthermal pressure .",
    "previous investigations found that some form of mixing is necessary in order for the remnants centers to retain the modest gas densities surmised from x - ray observations of post sedov phase snrs such as w44 .",
    "the hydrocode models thermal conduction , which diffuses entropy within the remnant s interior and so approximates the required mixing ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the electrons and ions behind the snr shock zone come into equilibrium early in the remnant s evolution , long before radiative cooling becomes important . as a result ,",
    "the snr s late term evolution ( which plays the largest role in calculating the remnant s",
    "o@xmath0  content , area coverage , and volume occupation ) is not affected by our approximation of instantaneous electrons and ion equilibration .",
    "cosmic rays affect snrs by contributing to the pressure behind the shock , while snrs affect cosmic rays by accelerating them .",
    "cosmic rays affect snrs by contributing to the pressure behind the shock , while snrs affect cosmic rays by accelerating them . in a careful analysis of supernova remnant evolution in the presence of cosmic rays and magnetic fields",
    ", @xcite explored several detailed interactions , but , nonetheless , found that their simulated snrs with cosmic rays were qualitatively similar to their simulated snrs without cosmic rays . in our simulation package , we include an isotropic cosmic ray pressure ( see section 2.5 ) , but neglect detailed interactions .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the interstellar medium s gas phase metal abundances are approximately solar and so adopt the abundances of @xcite .",
    "the code is similar to @xcite s code .",
    "papers i and ii used this code , describe it in detail , and present sample simulations .",
    "because the hydrocode s lagrangian mesh architecture does not model a stratified ambient media , we combine the snr simulations with the following analytic buoyancy calculations in order to determine if and how rapidly the remnants rise in the galaxy s stratified interstellar medium .      as a whole ,",
    "a snr is not buoyant , because its average density approximately equals that of the surrounding gas .",
    "only the very hot , rarefied interior should be buoyant .",
    "furthermore , buoyancy is probably not relevant for very young remnants because the buoyant acceleration acting on the bubble interiors is outpaced by the remnants expansion and because their magnetic fields tie the most buoyant material in their centers to the non - buoyant dense , ionized , postshock gas . later in a remnant s evolution",
    ", a cool shell develops between its hot bubble interior and its shockfront ( see @xcite , or paper i for detailed simulations ) . at this time",
    ", buoyant motion may exceed the hot bubble s expansion and the postshock shell cools , becomes somewhat neutral , and dissipates .",
    "it is in this stage that we consider the buoyant force .",
    "because we do not know how well the shell constrains the hot interior nor the strength of frictional drag , we consider a range of cases . in the first , we assume that the snrs do not rise buoyantly . in the second ,",
    "we assume that after the cool shell develops , the hot remnant interiors dissociate from the shell and rise buoyantly , but encounter some resistance . in the third ,",
    "we assume that after the cool shell develops , the hot remnant interiors dissociate from the shell and rise buoyantly , without resistance .",
    "below , we describe our analytical calculations for the buoyant motion of a hot bubble interior encountering frictional drag .",
    "the elementary equation for the acceleration due to buoyancy is :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath24 is the mass density of the ambient medium , @xmath25 is the mass density within the bubble , and @xmath20 is the height above the galactic plane .",
    "the acceleration of gravity at the sun s galactocentric radius is given by @xcite and @xcite as : @xmath26    as the bubble gains speed , it should experience increasing frictional drag . following @xcite , we calculate the frictional acceleration in the direction opposite to motion from @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cross sectional area of the hot bubble , @xmath29 is the hot bubble s velocity relative to the ambient medium @xmath30 is the ambient mass density",
    ", @xmath31 is the mass of the hot bubble ( determined from following simulations ) and @xmath32 is the drag coefficient . if the bubble slides frictionlessly through the ism , then @xmath33 .",
    "however , if the bubble sweeps up the overlying ism , then @xmath34 .",
    "if , in addition , a low pressure region develops behind the bubble , then @xmath32 exceeds 2 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 for hot bubbles in the ism is poorly known , but simulations suggest @xcite that it may be around 1 . here",
    "we consider 3 cases , @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 large enough to prevent bubble motion .    generally , the center of the hot bubble is the most rarefied and thus most buoyant , while the periphery of the hot bubble is the densest and least buoyant .",
    "a strong buoyancy gradient develops which may allow the interior to rise relative to the periphery . in our calculations of the mass and area of the hot bubble , we include only the buoyant region of the hot bubble . for computational simplicity",
    ", we assume that the buoyant region remains intact .",
    "thus , we calculate the force on this region and divide by its mass to find its average acceleration .",
    "we then iterate using small time steps to find the velocity and vertical displacement .",
    "as the bubble rises , it passes through successively more rarefied ambient gas . in some cases",
    ", a bubble will rise from its birth neighborhood into the overlaying neighborhood . at that point",
    "we account for the new environment s effects on the remnant by switching to the simulation results for a remnant evolving in the new environment .",
    "thus , we use the first part of the simulation for a remnant in the birth neighborhood and the second part of the simulation for a remnant in the overlaying neighborhood .",
    "we must deal with the possibility that the two remnants may have differing lifetimes and hence differing maturation rates . although the aging process may not be strictly linear",
    ", we define a remnant s `` maturity '' as the ratio of the present age to the total lifetime , where the remnant s lifetime is the time required for all of the material in a stationary remnant to cool below @xmath37  k ( see paper i for further discussions of remnant death ) .",
    "when we switch from the remnant evolving in the lower neighborhood to the remnant evolving in the overlaying neighborhood , we match maturities rather than ages . later in this article , we will perform time integrations . for the integrations",
    ", we will not count the time gap between the age of the first remnant and the age of the second .",
    "if we were to count that time , we would overestimate the effects of the remnants .",
    "nonetheless , when we allow the remnants to be buoyant , they live longer than stationary remnants , as shown in figure  [ fig : buoyancy ] .",
    "both the hydrocode simulations and the buoyancy calculations require estimates of the ambient density of material . from @xcite , the vertical distributions of molecular , neutral , warm ionized , and hot hydrogen nuclei are : @xmath38",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 the ratio of helium to hydrogen atoms is approximately 1 to 10 , so the total density of atoms is assumed to be approximately 1.1 times the density of hydrogen atoms . from equations  [ eq : n_mol ] through [ eq : n_h ] we see that the h  scaleheight is approximately 130  pc , half of the molecular , atomic , and ionized material lies below @xmath42  pc , and @xmath5 of the material lies below the scaleheight for isolated supernovae ( @xmath43  pc , presented below ) .      from @xcite , the volumetric rate of type 1a supernova explosions near the sun s galactocentric radius",
    "is : @xmath44 the expected rate of isolated type ib plus type ii supernova explosions is bracketed by estimates taken from @xcite ( lower range ) and calculated from @xcite ( upper range ) : @xmath45 note that isolated explosions account for only @xmath46 of the typeib and type ii rate .",
    "the remaining explosions occur in clusters near the galactic midplane .",
    "they create superbubbles , which are well analyzed in @xcite , but outside our frame of interest . for the following calculations , we will use the total isolated sn explosion rate at the sun s galactocentric radius , in which the isolated type ib plus type ii rate is taken as the average of the @xcite and @xcite estimates : @xmath47 in more conceptual terms , every million years 2 to 3 isolated progenitor stars explode within an open - ended column beginning at @xmath48  pc , extending to @xmath49 , having a cross sectional area of 1 kpc@xmath50 , and residing at the sun s galactocentric radius .      a remnant born at the sn progenitor scale height",
    "will be surrounded by a medium of density , @xmath51 , equal to 0.1 atoms @xmath52 .",
    "remnants born at half the scale height will be surrounded by @xmath53 atoms @xmath52 gas while remnants born at twice the scale height will encounter @xmath54 atoms @xmath52 gas . in order to account for the variation in ambient density above the galactic disk , we performed simulations for the following sample of seven ambient densities : 0.5  atoms  @xmath52 ( corresponding to a height of @xmath55  pc ) , 0.2 ( corresponding to a height of @xmath56  pc ) , 0.1 ( corresponding to a height of @xmath57  pc ) , 0.05 ( corresponding to a height of @xmath58  pc ) , 0.02 ( corresponding to a height of @xmath59  pc ) , 0.01 ( corresponding to a height of @xmath60  pc ) , and 0.005  atoms  @xmath52 ( corresponding to a height of @xmath61  pc ) .",

    "any given height , we have approximated the snrs environment as being homogeneous with a temperature , @xmath66 , of @xmath67  k. at this temperature , the hydrogen in this gas is ionized , as is typical of the reynolds layer and of the plasma surrounding and pre - ionized by supernova remnants .",
    "the turbulent pressure is thought to be small and is not explicitly included in the hydrocode simulations .",

    "the gas behind the shockfront undergoes rapid radiative cooling and so evolves into a cool shell which separates the ever - expanding shockfront from the hot , rarefied interior .",
    "although the remaining hot interior ( the hot bubble ) can be sufficiently hot and ionized to produce soft x - rays and uv photons , its density and therefore its intensity will be less than previously . as a result , an old remnant might not be observed or identified as a distinct entity .",

    "we sum the fractional area coverages of the six slabs . for stationary snrs",

    "we then sum across all slabs above @xmath48 pc .",
    "table  [ highioncoldenpopulation ] tabulates the resulting average column densities , for remnants that are assumed to be buoyant as well as those that are not .",

    ". this range may appear to be quite compact .",
    "moderately buoyant snrs would produce only 3 to @xmath127 more o@xmath0  than stationary snrs , while unfettered snrs would produce 35 to @xmath128 more o@xmath0than stationary snrs .",
    "for identical drag coefficients , cases 1 , 2 , and 3 vary by a factor of 2.1 to 2.4 , primarily due to the factor of 2 variation in assumed explosion energy .",
    "interestingly , increasing the nonthermal pressure by a factor of 4 ( from case 1 to case 2 ) slightly the net o@xmath0  contribution .",
    "the reason for this phenomenon is that remnants experiencing greater nonthermal pressure are smaller , therefore denser , therefore more luminous , and therefore shorter lived .",

    "n@xmath1 , and c@xmath2  column densities _ within _ individual snrs , as a function of age and radius , see paper i.    the height distribution of the o@xmath0-rich gas in extraplanar snrs is illustrated in figure  [ fig : colden_vs_z ] . for all choices of simulation parameters and drag coefficients , the @xmath129 to 670  pc slab makes the largest contribution to the sky averaged o@xmath0  column density . in section 4.2 , we will add the local o@xmath0  distribution and compare the result with _ copernicus _ , _ orfeus _ , and _ fuse _  observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : velocity ] displays the distribution of buoyant velocities for the population of supernova remnants . in making these plots , we assumed that the drag coeffient is 0 or 1 .",
    "no plot is needed for the stationary snrs , because their buoyant velocities are 0 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the plotted buoyant velocities are directed away from the galactic plane .",
    "the first step in calculating the distributions was to calculate each remnant s buoyant velocity as a function of time by integrating the buoyant acceleration with respect to time using small time steps .",
    "we assumed that buoyancy does not tear the remnants apart , so the calculated buoyant velocity was assumed to pertain to the entire supernova remnant .",
    "remnants born at different heights above the plane have different buoyancy histories .",
    "thus , the final distributions of velocities were found by making weighted compilations of the remnants buoyancy histories , where the weightings were proportional to the supernova explosion rate in the given slab .",
    "case 1 ( @xmath130  ergs , @xmath131 g ) remnants are the most buoyant , probably because the small assumed ambient nonthermal pressure allows the hot bubbles to expand to greater volumes , lowering the internal density and raising their buoyancy .",
    "case 2 remnants are the least buoyant for the converse reason . with drag coefficients of 0 and 1 , we only see the o@xmath0-rich gas moving away from the plane ; we do not see it stall and begin to fall back toward the plane .",
    "however , we saw the o@xmath0-rich gas rise and fall in preliminary estimates using larger drag coefficients .",
    "if there is moderate drag ( @xmath35 ) then the typical buoyant velocity will hover around 20 km sec@xmath6 . if there is no drag ( c = 0 ) , then the typical buoyant velocity increases to @xmath132 to @xmath133 km sec@xmath6 .",
    "if we were to observe such remnants , relative motions within the galaxy would probably increase the spread of observed velocities , as would motion within the remnants themselves ( see paper i for estimates ) .",
    "observations pointed at non - zenith directions record only the radial velocity , a trigonometric fraction of the velocity in the vertical direction .    the proceedure for calculating the high ion resonance line intensities is very similiar to that for calculating the column densities . theoretically , the average intensities are given by @xmath134 .",
    "we replace the integrals with summations .",
    "the resulting intensities are listed in table  [ highionintensitypopulation ] .",
    "allowing unrestrained buoyancy increases the sky - averaged intensities by only @xmath127 or less , thus much less significantly than it affects the high - stage ion column densities .",
    "buoyancy mostly affects the very late - term evolution of the remnants by extending their lives and elevating them into more rarefied surroundings .",

    "this compares well with the fraction of the sky covered by post shell formation phase snrs ( 30 to 90@xmath187 ) .    finally , we turn to the spectral temperature of the emission .",
    "several studies of _ rosat _ s low resolution spectra , including @xcite s and @xcite s found that the high latitude extraplanar emission has two temperature components , a @xmath202  k , non - homogeneously distributed component and a weaker , @xmath203  k , homogeneously distributed component . because they are distributed differently , the @xmath204  k and the @xmath205  k components are thought to originate in different regions .",

    "this was found to be the case when the simulated spectra were treated as real spectra ( i.e. convolved with the _ rosat _  response function and fit to collisional equilibrium spectral models ) , in paper ii .",
    "note that the snr plasma was often out of collisional ionizational equilibrium and as a result , the gas s temperature was generally higher or lower than the temperature calculated from its spectrum .",
    "soft x - rays are emitted by plasma whose carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen atoms have been ionized to the hydrogen - like and helium - like levels .",
    "the neighboring ions , lithium - like ions of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen can be observed by absorption or emission in their strong resonance line doublets in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum ( o@xmath0 : 1032 , 1038  ; n@xmath1 : 1239 , 1243  ; c@xmath2 : 1548 , 1551  ) .",

    "because our models begin at @xmath48  pc , we have also plotted the expected local contribution ( taken from @xcite ) and added it to our models in order to obtain the total quantity of o@xmath0  ions expected to reside between the sun and various heights above the plane .",

    "<S> we model snrs at a variety of heights above the disk with a detailed numerical simulation that includes non - equilibrium ionization and recombination and follows the remnants evolution until their hot bubbles have cooled . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically calculate the bubbles buoyant acceleration and frictional drag . from the simulation results , combined with the rates for isolated supernova explosions above a height of 130  pc </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the time and space average o@xmath0 , n@xmath1 , and c@xmath2column densities and emission intensities , @xmath3  kev soft x - ray surface brightness , area coverage , and volume occupation due to the population of isolated snrs above the galaxy s hi layer . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of assumed supernova explosion energy , ambient nonthermal pressure , or frictional drag coefficient used in the calculations , the predicted o@xmath0  column density as a function of height matches the observed distribution between 130  pc and 2000  pc . </S>",
    "<S> the o  resonance line emission ( 1032 , 1038 @xmath4 ) contributes significantly to the average observed intensity . assuming our modest supernova explosion rate , the population of isolated extraplanar snrs can explain @xmath5 of the observed @xmath3  kev surface brightness attributed to the extraplanar gas beyond the h  layer in the southern hemisphere . within the range of uncertainty in the sn rate </S>",
    "<S> , such snrs can explain all of this observed emission ( 400 counts s@xmath6 arcmin@xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , extraplanar snrs could be the most important sources of hot gas between the local bubble and @xmath8  pc in the relatively quiescent southern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> these results stand whether the remnants are assumed to be buoyant or not . </S>",
    "<S> the population of old extraplanar snrs should cover most , but not all of the high latitude sky , thus explaining the mottled appearance of the soft x - ray maps ( outside of superbubbles ) . </S>",
    "<S> bright young extraplanar snrs should cover less than @xmath9 of the high latitude sky . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the @xmath10 crescent in the @xmath3  kev x - ray maps could be such a remnant . </S>"
