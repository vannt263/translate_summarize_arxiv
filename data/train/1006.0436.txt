    ", photon radiation will be much stronger due to higher center - of - mass energies and stronger focussing of the beams , which makes it desirable to model photon radiation in kinematic fits .",
    "kinematic fitting is a well - established tool to improve jet energy and invariant mass resolutions .",
    "a number of four - vectors representing the final state particles is fitted under constraints such as energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the four - vectors are parametrized by suitably chosen variables such that the measured values follow an approximately gaussian distribution around the true values . a @xmath8 that quantifies the deviation between measured and fitted parameters",
    "is minimized under the condition that the imposed constraints are fulfilled @xcite .",
    "the improvement in resolution emerges from the redundant information contained in the measured values in the presence of constraints .",
    "unmeasured parameters reduce the redundancy , since one constraint is used up for each unmeasured parameter to determine its value . the redundancy is quantified by the number of degrees of freedom , which is given by the number of constraints minus the number of unmeasured parameters .",
    "the two main effects that cause the emission of photons collinear with the incoming beams so that they escape the main detector are initial state radiation ( isr ) and beamstrahlung .",
    "isr is a higher - order qed effect , at which real photons are emitted before the actual interaction .",
    "beamstrahlung is caused by the electrical fields of the bunches colliding with each other : electrons in the one bunch are deflected by the field of the other bunch and thus emit bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "isr is characterized by an energy spectrum that follows a power law with an exponent of roughly @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus the vast majority of events have at most one isr photon with an energy above a few gev , which is the accuracy to which the total energy and longitudinal momentum of fully hadronic events can be measured by a typical detector envisioned for the linear collider .",
    "this photon can , however , carry substantial energy of tens of gev .",
    "beamstrahlung on the other hand has an energy spectrum with an exponent of @xmath10 , but with an additional exponential suppression of high energy photons @xcite .",
    "the mean number of beamstrahlung photons emitted prior to the interaction can be of order one or even larger , depending on the beam parameters .",
    "this paper presents a novel method to take the energy and longitudinal momentum of photon radiation into account in kinematic fits .",
    "a priori information about the momentum spectrum of photon radiation is used to treat the photon s momentum as a measured parameter in the fit . as a test case ,",
    "the production of @xmath11/@xmath12 pairs decaying to light quark jets at the ilc is considered , with fully simulated monte carlo events as reconstructed by the international large detector ( ild ) @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the method and its application tests can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this method is an improved treatment of the effects of isr , because isr is the main source of highly energetic photons .",
    "therefore , only a single photon is included in the kinematic fit , with an energy spectrum given by a power law , as expected for isr .",
    "a similar method with the inclusion of two photons in the fit and an energy spectrum describing the combined effects of isr and beamstrahlung is the subject of ongoing work and beyond the scope of the current publication .",
    "however , the method presented here leads to a significant improvement also in the presence of beamstrahlung , as shown in section  [ sec : performance ] .",
    "since photons from isr and beamstrahlung escaping the detector have to a good approximation zero transverse momentum with respect to the beam direction , they affect mainly the conservation of ( detected ) energy @xmath13 and longitudinal momentum @xmath14 . the simplest method to cope with highly energetic photons in a constrained kinematic fit",
    "is therefore to drop the energy and longitudinal momentum conservation constraints , thus losing two degress of freedom .",
    "a somewhat better solution is to introduce a fit object representing the undetected photon with one free , unmeasured parameter , namely its longitudinal momentum @xmath15 , and set @xmath16 and thus @xmath17 .",
    "this allows the energy and @xmath14 constraints to be recovered , at the price of one unmeasured parameter , so that one degree of freedom is regained .",
    "however , this approach neglects the information about the momentum spectrum of the photons . here",
    "this information is used so that the photon is treated as a particle with a measured momentum of zero and an uncertainty derived from its known momentum spectrum .      in",
    "a kinematic @xmath8 fit the measured four - vector components of a particle or jet are parametrized with parameters @xmath18 ( e.g. , @xmath19 ) such that the difference @xmath20 between the measured @xmath21 and the true value @xmath22 follows a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath23 ( for reasons of notational simplicity we limit the discussion to the case where the parameters @xmath18 are uncorrelated ) .",

    "the distribution of the unmeasured momentum @xmath15 is known , though definitely non - gaussian .",

    "thus can not influence the global @xmath8 of the kinematic fit .",
    "therefore , the penalty term @xmath60 leads to a local minimum of the @xmath8 at this value of @xmath2 .",
    "this will also be the global minimum if the measured four - momenta of the final state particles are compatible with no missing momentum from isr . in this case , a fit with a photon fit object has exactly the same result as a fit without a photon .    due to this local minimum , any minimization method based on derivatives will always yield @xmath59 if this value is used as starting value in the minimization . therefore , to find the global minimum , in addition a different starting value must be tried , for instance @xmath61 calculated from the missing @xmath62 of the event .",
    "for @xmath63 , the curve rises steeply , so that large values of missing energy and momentum from isr and beamstrahlung can be accomodated by the kinematic fit at a moderate penalty @xmath60 .",
    "thus , for photon momenta that are large compared to the detector resolution , the kinematic fit should find a global minimum of the @xmath8 close to the true photon momentum , with a negligible bias towards low photon energies , despite the fact that the `` measured '' value of @xmath2 and thus of @xmath15 is set to zero .",
    "above @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath64 , the curve flattens again , so that extremely large photon momenta are suppressed due to the fact that they are increasingly unlikely .",
    "this region is , however , of little interest in realistic analyses .",
    "the method described above is applied to the process @xmath65 events .",
    "the fraction of successful fits , the width and the shift of the reconstructed @xmath66 mass peak are used to compare the performance of the various kinematic fit variants .",
    "the analysis sample was generated using the matrix element generator whizard @xcite , which takes into account all feynman diagrams leading to a given final state , including interference terms . here",
    ", the process @xmath67 is chosen , because it contains no heavy quarks in the final state , so that the jet energy and angle measurement is not compromised by the presence of neutrinos from semileptonic decays .",
    "in addition to the dominant @xmath66 pair production , also @xmath68 pair production contributes to the formation of this final state , and at a even smaller level single boson production with subsequent radiation off final state quarks .",
    "due to the inclusion of interference effects , it is conceptually not possible to identify events from these additional processes and remove them .",
    "the centre - of - mass energy is @xmath5 , and the @xmath66 mass was set to @xmath69 .",
    "the initial state radiation is also simulated by whizard , and one isr photon per incoming lepton is stored in the event record .",
    "in contrast , the energy spread of the incoming beams and beamstrahlung is taken into account in the event generation by a corresponding variation of the momenta of the incoming leptons , using a beamstrahlung spectrum that was simulated with guinea - pig @xcite .",
    "for this calculation the nominal beam parameter set of the ilc was assumed , @xcite , in particular an energy spread of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the electron and positron beams , respectively , a beamstrahlung parameter @xmath72 , a mean energy loss by beamstrahlung of @xmath73 , and a vertical disruption parameter of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the momenta of isr photons are directly accessible in the event record , while the combined effect of beamstrahlung and beam energy spread has to be deduced from the total four - momentum of all final state particles .",
    "a full simulation of the ild detector @xcite is performed by the geant based simulation program mokka @xcite . in the event reconstruction , which is implemented as part of the software package marlinreco @xcite ,",

    "is used to evaluate a possible bias of the kinematic fit , and whether the addition of a photon removes this bias and increases the fraction of good fits . * a subsample with large @xmath86 serves to quantify how well the fit with photon works , and whether it has any advantage over a fit where",

    "kinematic fits are applied to the four jets in the events from the test sample , comparing the event hypotheses `` 4  jets '' ( @xmath87 ) and `` 4  jets + 1  photon '' ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "both event hypotheses are fitted with five constraints ( @xmath89-fit ) : conservation of energy , conservation of the three momentum components and equal di - jet masses .",
    "in addition , the events are fitted also using only the three constraints ( @xmath90-fit ) that are not affected by the presence of photon radiation , i.e. conservation of the transverse momentum components and the equal mass constraint .    as discussed in sect .",

    "alternatively , the constraints are set to these nominal values , so that the combined effects of isr and beamstrahlung can be studied .",
    "an important indicator for the performance of the various kinematic fits considered is the fraction of good fits , which are defined as those having a fit probability @xmath95 .    due to the intrinsic widths of the @xmath66 and @xmath68 bosons , which are not negligible compared to the detector resolution at an ild - type detector ,",
    "the equal - mass constraint is only approximately fulfilled by the four - vectors on generator level and therefore reduces the fraction of good fits .",
    "the equal - mass constraint is applied mainly in order to choose the correct jet pairing .",
    "the fit is performed for all three possible jet pairings , and the pairing that results in the best @xmath8 value is chosen as the correct one under the assumption that the jets stem from either a @xmath11 or a @xmath96 pair . because of the @xmath66 and @xmath68 width , the equal - mass constraint leads to an average @xmath8 contribution that is significantly higher than the value expected for the addition of one constraint , i.e. one degree of freedom . as a consequence ,",

    "however , if this mass shift depends on the amount of energy from isr and beamstrahlung , it leads to a broadening of the signal and thus a loss of resolution ; in addition , systematic uncertainties arise from the description of the isr and in particular the beamstrahlung energy spectrum .",
