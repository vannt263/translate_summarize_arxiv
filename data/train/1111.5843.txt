    "according to the boltzmann equation ( [ boltz ] ) , a rarefied gas confined in a bounded domain , in contact with a thermal reservoir modeled by ( [ fdiffuse ] ) at a given constant temperature @xmath11 ( isothermal ) , has an equilibrium state described by the maxwellian @xmath12and it is well known @xcite that such an equilibrium is reached exponentially fast , at least if the initial state is close to the above maxwellian in a suitable norm .",
    "if the temperature @xmath11 at the boundary is not uniform in ( fdiffuse ) , such a statement is not true and the existence of stationary solutions and the rate of convergence require a much more delicate analysis , because rather complex phenomena are involved .",
    "for example , suppose that the domain is just a slab between two parallel plates at fixed temperatures @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "then , one expects that a stationary solution is reached , where there is a steady flow of heat from the hotter plate to the colder one .",
    "the approach to the stationary solution may involve convective motions , oscillations and possibly more complicated phenomena .",
    "even the description of the stationary solution is not obvious , and the relation between the heat flux and the temperature gradient , ( e.g. the fourier law ( [ fourierlaw1 ] ) ) , is not _ a priori _ known . a first answer to such questions",
    "can be given confining the analysis to the small knudsen number regime ( i.e. , k@xmath16 in ( [ boltzmann ] ) ) , where the particles undergo a large number of collision per unit time and a hydrodynamic regime is established .",
    "in this case , it can be formally shown , using expansion techniques c , cc , that the lowest order in k@xmath17 is a maxwellian local equilibrium and the evolution is ruled by macroscopic equations , such as the navier - stokes equations . in particular , the heat flux vector @xmath18 turns out to be proportional to the gradient of temperature , as predicted by the fourier law @xmath19 with the heat conductivity @xmath20 depending on the interaction potential .",
    "this was first obtained by maxwell and boltzmann @xcite which relates the macroscopic heat flow to the microscopic potential of interaction between the molecules .",
    "the rigorous proof of such a statement was given in @xcite in the case of the slab geometry and provided that @xmath21 is sufficiently small ( uniformly in the knudsen number k@xmath17 ) .",
    "this is a special case of a problem which has received recently a large attention in the statistical mechanics community , the derivation of the fourier law from the microscopic deterministic evolutions ruled by the newton or schrdinger equation or from stochastic models @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the thermal conduction phenomena in the kinetic regime .",
    "this problem was studied in the slab geometry , for small knudsen numbers in @xcite and for large knudsen number ( k@xmath22 ) in @xcite .",
