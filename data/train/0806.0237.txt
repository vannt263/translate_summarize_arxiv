    "the entanglement of electrons in cooper pairs of a superconductor can generate non - local transport effects .",
    "a prominent example is _ crossed andreev reflection _ ( car ) at the contact between a superconductor and two normal leads : there the two electrons with opposite spins and symmetric energies with respect to the fermi level of the superconductor , that are transferred through the normal - superconductor interface via andreev reflection,@xcite originate from or end up in different normal leads .",

    "strong coulomb interaction in the quantum dot seems to be counterproductive : the formation of a finite equilibrium superconducting pair amplitude is suppressed since a large charging energy prevents the equilibrium state to be a coherent superposition of dot states with particle numbers differing by two , and cooper pairs can be transferred through the dot by higher - order tunneling processes ( cotunneling ) only . on the other hand , a finite _ non - equilibrium _",

    "the relevance from the experimental point of view is proven by the recent success in coupling superconductors to quantum dots in either a carbon nanotube@xcite or a semiconductor nanowire.@xcite in particular , we propose to investigate non - local effects in andreev transport through a single - level quantum dot with one superconducting and two normal - conducting leads , which may be ( i ) ferromagnetic with collinear magnetization or ( ii ) non - magnetic ( see fig .",

    ", we realize that in this regime there are combined andreev processes that involve both the interfaces from the quantum dot to the superconductor and the left lead , while there are no andreev processes involving electron transfer between quantum dot and right lead . the intermediate - voltage andreev transport between left lead and superconductor",
    "yields an average dot charge that is determined by the dot level s position relative to the chemical potential of the superconductor rather than that of the normal lead : for positive ( negative ) detuning the probability of double occupation decreases ( increases ) , and the average occupation of the dot is smaller ( larger ) than one .",
    "this deviation from single occupancy is probed by the right lead . changing the sign of detuning leads to a sign change in the current measured in the right lead .",
    "we remark that the negative non - local conductance is not due to car .",
    "in fact , making the normal - conducting leads ferromagnetic suppresses the negative non - local conductance , independent of whether the ferromagnets are aligned parallel or antiparallel , since a finite spin accumulation on the quantum dot reduces the dot pair amplitude . for car",
    "an enhanced ( reduced ) effect would be expected for the antiparallel ( parallel ) alignment .",
    "the effect that we predict is rather a consequence of combined andreev processes between left lead and superconductor .",
    "the negative non - local conductance can only be probed because of a large charging energy that prohibits direct transport between the normal - conducting leads .",
    "we investigated non - local andreev transport through an interacting quantum dot in a three - terminal setup with one superconducting and two normal - conducting leads .",
    "we considered two different biasing schemes . in the first one , the normal - conducting leads are ferromagnetic with collinear magnetizations and they are kept at the same chemical potential .",
    "the key results for this case is that car occurs due to the non - equilibrium proximity effect in the dot and it is characterized by a finite tmr . in the second scheme , the two normal - conducting leads are non magnetic , and the response of the current in one lead to the voltage applied to the other one is studied . in that case , non - local andreev transport is identified by negative values of the non - local differential conductance . even more strikingly , we find regimes with negative values of the full non - local conductance .",
    "the virtue of employing quantum dots lies , first , in the possibility to tune the andreev channels by a gate voltage and , second , in the presence of a large charging energy which generates specific transport regimes characterized by a negative non - local conductance .",
    "both aspects are advantageous for a clear identification of non - local andreev transport .",
