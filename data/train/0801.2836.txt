    "the casimir effect can be considered as a response of the ground state in a quantum field theory to the presence of boundary conditions .",
    "therefore it is natural to seek a relation to the approach known as boundary quantum field theory started in two - dimensional space - time by the seminal paper of ghoshal and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "recently we have developed and extended this formalism to quantum field theories in arbitrary space - time dimensions and applied it to the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "here we give a short review of our results .",
    "following @xcite we consider an euclidean quantum field theory of a scalar field @xmath2 defined in a @xmath3 dimensional half space - time , parameterized as @xmath4 , in the presence of a codimension one flat boundary located at @xmath5 the correlation functions defined as @xmath6}}{\\int\\,\\mathcal{d}\\phi\\ , e^{-s[\\phi]}}\\ ] ] contain all information about the theory .",
    "the measure in the functional integral is provided by the classical action@xmath7=\\int d\\vec{r}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dy\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}dx\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^{2}+u(\\phi)\\right)+u_{b}(\\phi(x=0,y,\\vec{r}))\\right]\\ ] ] which determines also the boundary condition via the boundary potential @xmath8:@xmath9 here we assume for simplicity that the boundary term does not depend on the temporal ( i.e. @xmath10 ) derivative of @xmath2 , which means that there are no boundary degrees of freedom with a temporal dynamics independent of the bulk ( it may depend on derivatives with respect to @xmath11 , which is the reason for the variational derivative @xmath12 ) .",
    "the bulk interaction @xmath13 is constrained by the requirement that the bulk spectrum must possess a mass gap @xmath14 .",
    "this euclidean quantum field theory can be considered as the imaginary time version of two different minkowskian quantum field theories .",
    "we can consider @xmath15 as minkowskian time and so the boundary is located in space providing nontrivial boundary condition for the field @xmath16 the space of states in this hamiltonian description is the boundary hilbert space @xmath17 determined by the configurations on the equal time slices .",
    "@xmath17 contains multi - particle states and is built over the vacuum state , obtained in the presence of the boundary condition ( @xmath18 ) , by the successive application of particle creation operators . in the asymptotic past the particles do not interact and behave as free particles travelling towards the boundary ; thus @xmath19 where the operator @xmath20 creates an asymptotic particle of mass @xmath14 with transverse ( i.e. @xmath21-directional ) momentum @xmath22 and parallel ( i.e. parallel to the boundary ) momentum @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding energy is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the effective mass of a particle with parallel momentum @xmath23 as seen in the two - dimensional space - time formed by @xmath26 and @xmath21 . instead of @xmath22",
    ", we shall also frequently use the rapidity parameter @xmath27 defined by@xmath28 in the heisenberg picture the time evolution of the field@xmath29 is generated by the following boundary hamiltonian @xmath30\\label{eq : boundaryham}\\ ] ] the correlator can then be understood as the matrix element @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes time ordering with respect to time @xmath26 , and the vacuum @xmath18 is normalized to @xmath33 .",
    "the formulation of asymptotic states and fields , together with the relevant reduction formulae ( which generalize the lsz approach to boundary qft ) was given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we also gave the appropriate generalization of landau equations , coleman - norton interpretation and cutkosky rules , together with an example of one - loop renormalization of boundary interaction ( where we considered the case of sine - gordon model in two space - time dimensions ) .",
    "elastic reflection of a particle from the boundary ( see figure [ fig : the - two - channels ] ) is a process with one particle of energy @xmath34 and parallel momentum @xmath23 both in the incoming and outgoing state , whose transverse momentum @xmath22 changes sign .",
    "its amplitude is the _ reflection factor _ @xmath35 which can only depend on @xmath36 , as a result of rotational invariance in the directions parallel to the boundary ; it is not necessarily unitary due to the possible existence of inelastic processes .     the two hamiltonian descriptions , with a representation of the amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 . ]",
    "alternatively we can also consider @xmath39 as minkowskian time , as depicted in figure [ fig : the - two - channels ] . in this case the boundary is located in time and we can use the usual infinite volume hamiltonian description .",
    "the hilbert space is the bulk hilbert space @xmath40 spanned by multi - particle _ in _ states @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the momentum in the @xmath10 direction , and the energy corresponding to the time direction is given by @xmath43 .",
    "one can again use a rapidity parametrization in this channel defined by@xmath44 time evolution @xmath45 is generated by the bulk hamiltonian @xmath46 and the boundary appears in time as a final state in calculating the correlator : @xmath47 the state @xmath48 is called the boundary state , which is an element of the bulk hilbert space and is defined by the equality of the two alternative hamiltonian descriptions @xmath49 where the correspondence is valid if @xmath50 is identified with @xmath51 . using asymptotic completeness",
    "the boundary state can be expanded in the basis of asymptotic _ in _ states as coefficients indicate that the above expansion is that of the conjugate ( `` bra '' ) boundary state . ]",
    "@xmath52 which we refer to as the cluster expansion for the boundary state ( where due to translational invariance only bulk multi - particle states with zero total momentum can appear ) .",
    "the one - point function of the field , due to unbroken poincar symmetry along the boundary , only has a nontrivial dependence on @xmath21:@xmath54 which corresponds to a nontrivial vacuum configuration in the presence of the boundary condition .",
    "the leading asymptotic behaviour for @xmath55 is given by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the vacuum expectation value in the bulk and @xmath58 is a parameter which is characteristic of the boundary condition ( and also of the field @xmath2 ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath18 is the ground state of the boundary system which means that there are no bulk excitations present and the boundary itself is in its ground state .",
    "the absence of bulk excitations is important for the above asymptotics to be valid ; however , ( [ eq:1ptas ] ) also holds when the boundary is excited ( surface plasmons ) .    using the property of the interpolating field @xmath2@xmath59 where @xmath60 is the bulk wave function renormalization constant ( @xmath61 ) , and from the cluster expansion ( [ eq : bstate_expanded ] )",
    "one obtains the relation is replaced by any bulk interpolating field for the asymptotic particles and its appropriate wave function renormalization @xmath60 ; in that case @xmath58 also needs to be replaced by another constant which corresponds to the field considered.]@xmath62 on the other hand , the existence of nontrivial vacuum expectation value for the field is generally related to a singularity of the reflection factor at the particular kinematical point @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( i.e. @xmath65 or equivalently @xmath66 ) . in our paper @xcite it was shown that this singularity takes the following form @xmath67 with @xmath68 parametrizing its strength . using the cluster property of local quantum field theory we proved the following relation @xmath69 valid for general quantum field theories , which yields the expression of @xmath70 in terms of @xmath68:@xmath71",
    "this extends a relation previously conjectured in the case of two - dimensional integrable field theories @xcite . in the two - dimensional case",
    ", there is no parallel momentum @xmath23 and the rapidity parametrization ( [ eq : ddimrapidity ] ) takes the form@xmath72 as a result , the singularity ( [ eq:2pt_sing_assumption ] ) corresponds to a pole @xcite@xmath73 let us now turn to @xmath74 . using the reduction formulae derived in @xcite the relation to @xmath37 can be obtained as follows : @xmath75 this can be written using the rapidity parametrizations ( [ eq : ddimrapidity],[eq : closedrapidity ] ) as ) and ( [ eq : closedrapidity ] ) .",
    "we can consider them related by analytic continuation.]@xmath76 and this relation fits very well with the pictorial representation in figure [ fig : the - two - channels ] . in two space - time dimensions",
    "this is the same as the relation obtained by ghoshal and zamolodchikov in @xcite .",
    "we remark that when the theory in the bulk is free and the reflection is elastic , the boundary state can be written in a closed form@xmath77",
    "the folding trick , illustrated for a generic defect scattering process ]    boundary conditions considered in the context of the casimir effect generally allow transmission as well , and such boundaries are called defects. a suitable generalization of the boundary state formalism can be obtained by a folding trick depicted in figure [ fig : the - folding - trick ] , which maps the defect into a boundary system @xcite .",
    "suppose now that a defect is located at @xmath78 .",
    "in the crossed channel ( where time flows in the @xmath21 direction ) it can be represented by a defect operator which acts from the bulk hilbert space of the @xmath79 system into that of the @xmath80 system .",
    "one - particle defect amplitudes ]    let us denote the operator creating the particle for the @xmath79 domain as @xmath81 while for the @xmath80 domain as @xmath82 .",
    "there are now four one - particle reflection amplitudes , shown in figure [ fig : one - particle - defect - amplitudes ] .",
    "two of them are denoted @xmath83 and preserve the species number @xmath84 , corresponding in the defect picture to reflections on the left and on the right side , respectively .",
    "the other two , @xmath85 are the ones changing @xmath33 into @xmath86 and @xmath86 into @xmath33 , and in the defect picture they describe transmission from left to right and right to left , respectively . these can be conveniently put together into a defect matrix @xmath87 using the folding map to the boundary system we obtain the defect operator @xcite as @xmath88 with the same conditions as for the boundary state ( trivial bulk scattering , and elasticity for the combined one - particle reflection / transmission amplitude ) the defect operator can be summed up into an exponential form similar to ( [ eq : b_exp ] ) , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of casimir energy of a @xmath3 dimensional scalar field @xmath89 in a domain of width @xmath90 in @xmath21 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "consider two defects located at a distance @xmath90 with defect matrices @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the ground state eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath93 in ( [ eq : boundaryham ] ) can be evaluated via the partition function .",
    "compactifying all infinite ( temporal and spatial ) dimensions ( i.e. the @xmath94 extensions perpendicular to @xmath21 ) to circles with perimeter @xmath95 we can evaluate the partition function in two different ways @xcite:@xmath96 where @xmath97 is the bulk hamiltonian ( [ eq : bulkham ] ) in the @xmath21 channel in the domain between the two defects and @xmath98 is the corresponding bulk vacuum state . inserting a complete set of bulk asymptotic states we obtain@xmath99 normalizing the bulk ground state energy @xmath100 to @xmath101 , the first few terms can be written explicitly as@xmath102 the term @xmath33 is the contribution from the vacuum ( @xmath103 ) , the next term comes from two - particle terms in ( [ eq : d_expansion ] ) and the higher - order corrections come from the higher multi - particle terms .",
    "this is a sort of cluster expansion similar to the one used in @xcite , valid for large values of the volume @xmath90 .",
    "finite volume restricts the momenta to @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and the normalization of the creation operators becomes@xmath106=t^{d}\\omega(\\kappa,\\vec{k})\\delta_{\\kappa,\\kappa^{'}}\\delta_{\\vec{k},\\vec{k}^{'}}\\ ] ] the ground state ( casimir ) energy ( per unit transverse area ) can be extracted from the partition function as @xmath107 the result is@xmath108 the correction terms correspond to higher particle terms in the expansion ( [ eq : d_expansion ] ) of the defect operator @xmath94 and include the amplitudes of reflection / transmission processes involving more than one particle in at least one of the asymptotic states .",
    "these can be computed ( together with the reflection factors @xmath83 ) e.g. using a bqft formulation as the one presented in @xcite , but it is obvious that they are suppressed by a factor @xmath109 with respect to the leading order term due to the presence of at least one additional particle in the corresponding term of the expansion of the defect operator @xmath94 . note that ( [ eq : leading_order ] ) is applicable in the presence of nontrivial bulk and boundary interactions : their effects at leading order are contained in the reflection factors @xmath83 , so as long as there is some theoretical or experimental input from which these can be determined the leading order contribution can be evaluated .    in the elastic case",
    "the expansion can be summed up @xcite:@xmath110 let us now calculate the ground state energy in the presence of nontrivial vacuum configuration of the field . for simplicity",
    "we suppose that the boundary is totally reflective . compactifying the other directions again to circles of perimeter @xmath95 with periodic boundary conditions we obtain @xmath111 the leading finite size correction to the ground state energy for large @xmath90",
    "is now given by one - particle terms , and the ground state energy per transverse area ( at leading order in @xmath90 ) has the form @xcite @xmath112 for partially reflecting boundaries ( i.e. defects ) the appropriate @xmath53 coefficient is the one - particle coupling of the defects evaluated in the domain between them .",
    "if one of the @xmath53-s is zero then the leading correction comes from two - particle states , and is identical to ( [ eq : leading_order ] ) .",
    "a very appealing property of the boundary state approach is the universality of the formulae ( [ eq : leading_order ] ) and ( [ eq : alt3 ] ) . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the latter indeed reproduces all the results previously known for the planar situation , including the famous lifshitz formula @xcite ( it also provides a way to compute new cases easily , as we demonstrated for a massive scalar field with robin boundary condition ) .",
    "another important point is that this approach formulates the casimir effect from an infrared viewpoint .",
    "standard derivations of the casimir effect solve the microscopic field theory .",
    "this necessitates tackling diverse issues such as renormalization , and also the possibility that the infrared ( long distance behaviour ) may be quite different from the microscopic description of the theory ( as is the case for example in qcd ) .",
    "formula ( [ eq : leading_order ] ) expresses the effect in terms of the asymptotic particles , and provides a long distance expansion for casimir energy .",
    "our results are consistent with the philosophy behind the more recent approach by emig et .",
    "@xcite , the origins of which can be found in the earlier papers @xcite . from this viewpoint",
    "the casimir effect is an interaction of fluctuating surface charge densities , and therefore it does not logically imply the existence of ( astronomically large ) zero point energies because the bulk energy density can be trivially discarded . in the boundary state approach the surface",
    "is characterized by the coefficients in the cluster expansion of the boundary state ( [ eq : bstate_expanded ] ) ( or , more generally , the defect operator ( [ eq : d_expansion ] ) ) .",
    "both approaches give manifestly finite results , with no ultraviolet divergences whatsoever .",
    "there are some differences , however .",
    "while the boundary state approach only works easily for the planar case , their methods can be used for general geometries . on the other hand ,",
    "the approach of @xcite is only formulated for free field theories with linear boundary conditions since it relies heavily on the computation of gaussian path integrals , while in the boundary state approach the expansion can be written down for interacting field theories with nonlinear boundary conditions , in terms of their long distance scattering data .",
    "the fact that the path integral is gaussian also gives emig et al .",
    "the ability to tackle theories with zero mass gap , which is only possible in the boundary state approach whenever the expansion can be resummed into the form ( [ eq : alt3 ] ) . the boundary state approach , on the other hand , provides access to highly nontrivially interacting theories with a mass gap ( a prominent example of which is qcd ) , provided the relevant scattering data are determined e.g. from lattice field theory ( we remark that it is also highly successful in two - dimensional integrable field theories where exact scattering amplitudes are known ) .",
    "it is important to note that the restriction of the boundary state approach to the planar case comes from the fact that the high symmetry of the planar situation is exploited to relate the boundary states ( or defect operators ) to the scattering data , therefore it is not a restriction inherent in any theoretical principle .",
    "finally we remark that the results ( [ eq : leading_order],[eq : alt3 ] ) automatically include the contribution of states localized to the defects ( surface plasmons ) as discussed in @xcite ."
