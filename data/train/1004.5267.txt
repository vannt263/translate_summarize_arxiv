    "after four years of waiting since the detection of x - ray flash ( xrf ) 060218/sn 2006aj , another pair of low - luminosity ( ll ) grb - supernova ( sn ) association ,",
    "xrf 100316d / sn 2010bh at redshift @xmath4 @xcite , was captured by _ swift _",
    "@xcite on march 16 , 2010 @xcite , with a detection rate fully consistent with the population studies of these nearby ll - grb events @xcite . before this event ,",
    "four pairs of nearby ( @xmath5 ) secure grb(xrf)-sn associations have been identified .",
    "these are grb 980425/sn 1998bw at @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , grb 030329/sn 2003dh at @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the nature of the grb / sn connection and the interplay between the grb and the sn components are still poorly understood . in this paper",
    ", we analyze and interpret the _ swift _ bat and xrt data of xrf 100316d , paying special attention to the similarities and differences between the xrf 100316d / sn 2010bh and xrf 060218/sn 2006aj .",
    "grb 100316d triggered _",
    "swift_/bat at 12:44:50 ut ( @xmath11 ) , and the xrt began observing the field 137.7 seconds after the bat trigger ( stamatikos et al .",
    "2010 ) . a bright",
    ", steady un - catalogued x - ray source was detected . by analyzing the bat survey data before and after the trigger time , it is found that this event possibly started at @xmath12 seconds @xcite . however , the gamma - ray flux of the source kept almost constant from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , before increasing significantly at @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore take the starting time of this event as @xmath15 seconds .",
    "the host galaxy redshift is @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "an associated supernova , sn 2010bh , was detected by wiersema et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and spectroscopically confirmed by chornock et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "we extract the observed lightcurves and spectra of xrf 100316d from the bat and xrt event data .",
    "the details of our data reduction are presented in @xcite and @xcite . the joint bat / xrt spectrum from @xmath16",
    "s to @xmath17 s is well fit with a cutoff power - law model , with a power - law index of @xmath18 and a spectral peak energy @xmath19 of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , fig.[fig : bat - xrt ] ) .",
    "together with the joint bat - xrt fit , we are able to constrain @xmath0 kev and therefore define this burst as an xrf . ] .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray and the gamma - ray emissions are from the same emission component .",
    "a time - resolved spectral analysis during the period from @xmath16 s to @xmath17 s shows that @xmath19 clearly evolves with time , from @xmath22 kev ( from @xmath16 s to @xmath23 s ) to @xmath24 kev ( from @xmath23 s to @xmath25 s ) .",
    "the un - absorbed lightcurves and the temporal evolution of @xmath19 are shown in figure [ fig : xrt ] , along with the data of grb 060218 .",
    "the late x - ray lightcurves of the other nearby grbs , including grb 980425 , 031203 , and 030929 , are also displayed in figure [ fig : xrt ] .",
    "the x - ray light curves of xrf 100316d and xrf 060218 are rather similar .",
    "both have an plateau phase extending to more than 1000 s. in the case of xrf 100316d , there is an observational gap between @xmath17 s and @xmath26 s. the late - time observational data ( after @xmath26 s ) is soft and consistent with a single power law decay with a decay index @xmath27 .",
    "this is similar to the late x - ray lightcurve of xrf 060218 .",
    "xrf 060218 also shows a steep decay phase between the plateau and the late single power law decay phase .",
    "although this is not observed in xrf 100316d , the data before @xmath25 s and after @xmath26 s are consistent with having such a steep decay segment in between .",
    "there are however some differences between the two events .",
    "first , the x - ray data of xrf 060218 demand a soft thermal emission component with an evolving temperature , which has been interpreted as due to shock breakout from the progenitor star @xcite . for xrf 100316d , we find that the data do not demand such a component .",
    "we noticed that @xcite claimed a thermal component with @xmath28 kev and an energy that is @xmath29 of the entire x - ray emission . to check the consistency",
    ", we fit the time dependent bat+xrt joint spectra by a cutoff power - law model ( with absorption from both milk way and the host galaxy , wabs*zwabs*cutoffpl in xspec 12 ) and a blackbody+cutoff power - law model .",
    "we find that both models can give equally acceptable fits to the data .",
    "for example , for the slice 2 ( from @xmath30 s to @xmath25 s ) , the former model gives @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while the latter gives @xmath34 with a larger host galaxy absorption @xmath35 and a thermal temperature that is consistent with @xcite .",
    "note that the peak of the proposed black body component is near the low end of the xrt energy band and the neutral hydrogen absorption around the thermal peak is large .",
    "this makes great uncertainty on identification of such a thermal emission component from the data .",
    "our spectral analysis can not robustly identify this component , although the @xmath36 is slightly improved by adding it .",
    "therefore , we do not claim a thermal emission in the observed spectrum and only stick to the cutoff power - law model to discuss possible theoretical implications .",
    "the second difference between the two events lies in the supernova data .",
    "the modeling of sn 2006aj suggests a kinetic energy @xmath37 erg @xcite , much smaller than that of other sne associated with nearby grbs ( see fig.[fig : sn - grb ] ) .",
    "although the modeling of sn 2010bh is not available yet , current data imply an sn event as energetic as sn 1998bw @xcite and ( 2 ) the density of expanding sn material takes the form @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , j. s. deng , private communication , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is straightforward to show that the mass of the sn material moving faster than @xmath40 is @xmath41 , where @xmath40 is the photospheric velocity at @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the thompson scattering cross section and @xmath44 is the rest mass of proton .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy is @xmath45 . for sn 2010bh , @xmath46 at @xmath47 day",
    ", we have @xmath48~{\\rm erg}$ ] . [ foot:2 ] ] , which is about one order of magnitude more energetic than sn 2006aj .",
    "so from the observational point of view , xrf 100316d / sn 2010bh and xrf 060218/sn 2006aj are not strictly `` twins '' .",

    "in the following , we define @xmath54 s , i.e. the time elapse since @xmath15 s. we interpret all the bat / xrt data of xrf 100316d for @xmath55 as `` prompt emission '' ( i.e. the radiation powered by some internal energy dissipation processes ) for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the steady plateau behavior observed in both bat and xrt band at @xmath56 with an evolving @xmath57 is difficult to interpret within afterglow models .",
    "second , the sharp decline of the x - ray emission ( @xmath58 or even steeper ) expected in the time interval @xmath59 resembles the early rapid decline that has been detected in a considerable fraction of _ swift _ grbs , which is widely taken as a piece of evidence of the end of prompt emission @xcite .",
    "the nature of the x - ray emission detected at @xmath60 s is hard to pin down .",
    "its spectrum is very soft ( photon index @xmath61 ) , similar to that of xrf 060218 .",
    "this is also unexpected in the external forward shock models , and this late x - ray component may be related to a late central engine afterglow , whose origin is unclear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the prompt bat / xrt data do not show a significant variability ( fig.[fig : xrt ] ) .",
    "the time - averaged @xmath10ray luminosity is @xmath62 and the x - ray luminosity is @xmath63 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the xrf outflow is therefore expected to be in the order of @xmath64 .",
    "the duration of the bat emission is at least @xmath65 s , and can be longer .",
    "the relatively steady energy output is naturally produced if _ the central engine is a neutron star with significant dipole radiation_. the dipole radiation luminosity of a magnetized neutron star can be described as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dipole magnetic field strength of the neutron star at the magnetic pole , @xmath68 is the radius of the neutron star , @xmath69 is the angular frequency of radiation at @xmath70 , @xmath71 s is the corresponding spin - down timescale of the magnetar , and @xmath72 is the typical moment of inertia of the magnetar ( pacini 1967 ; gunn & ostriker 1969 ) . here the convention @xmath73 is adopted in cgs units .",
    "one then has @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "an abrupt drop in the x - ray flux with a slope steeper than @xmath58 may be interpreted as a decrease of radiation efficiency , or the collapse of the neutron star into a black hole , possibly by losing the angular momentum or by accreting materials .",
    "within such a model , the fact that @xmath76 would require @xmath77 .",

    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the composition of this spindown - powered outflow is likely poynting - flux - dominated . besides the magnetar argument ( which naturally gives a highly magnetized outflow )",
    ", another argument would be the lack of a bright thermal component with a temperature @xmath86 from the outflow photosphere as predicted in the baryonic outflow model , where @xmath87 is the initial radius where the outflow is accelerated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one may argue that the photosphere radiation peaks at the observed @xmath19 .",
    "such a scenario , however , is hard to account for the x - ray spectrum @xmath88 .    below",
    "we discuss a possible magnetic dissipation scenario that would interpret xrf 100316d prompt emission . by comparing the pair density ( @xmath89",
    ", @xmath90 is the radial distance from the central source ) and the density required for co - rotation ( @xmath91 beyond the light cylinder of the compact object ) , one can estimate the radius at which the mhd condition breaks down , which reads @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the ratio of the magnetic energy flux to the particle energy flux , @xmath94 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow , @xmath95 is the minimum variability timescale of the central engine @xcite . beyond this radius ,",
    "intense electromagnetic waves are generated and outflowing particles are accelerated @xcite .",
    "part of the poynting flux energy is converted to radiation . at @xmath96 ,",

    "when magnetic dissipation occurs , a fraction @xmath100 of the dissipated comoving magnetic energy would be eventually converted to the comoving kinetic energy of the electrons .",
    "electrons may be linearly accelerated in the electric fields or stochastically accelerated in the random electromagnetic fields .",
    "one may assume that the accelerated electrons form a single power - law distribution in energy , i.e. @xmath101 for @xmath102 , where @xmath103 can be estimated as @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . at @xmath96 ,",
    "the corresponding synchrotron radiation frequency is @xcite @xmath106 the cooling lorentz factor can be estimated by @xmath107 , which gives a synchrotron cooling frequency @xmath108 .",
    "the observed xrt spectrum can be approximated by @xmath109 , which is close to the fast cooling spectrum @xmath110 , suggesting @xmath111 ( it is straightforward to show that for the fiducial parameters adopted in this work the synchrotron self - absorption is below the optical band ) . on the other hand , the non - detection of prompt emission by uvot @xcite favors a high cooling frequency @xmath112 hz . as shown in fig.[fig : sed ] , the synchrotron radiation model with such a high @xmath113 can roughly account for the data .",
    "we then get a constraint @xmath114 substituting this into eq.([eq : nu_m ] ) we get @xmath115 within such a scenario , @xmath19 is defined by @xmath116 [ eq.([eq : nu_m ] ) ] .",
    "an observed evolving @xmath19 may be understood by invoking a decreasing @xmath93 , which is consistent with the magnetic field dissipation hypothesis . for @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 is planck s constant )",
    ", the spectrum is @xmath119 .",
    "the typical variability timescale of the radiation powered by the magnetic energy dissipation can be estimated as @xmath120 which is much larger than the rotation period @xmath121 of the magnetar , implying that the pulsation of the central engine is undetectable .",
    "so far the nearby supernova - associated grbs , except grb 030329 , are found to be intrinsically under - luminous .",
    "they share the similarities such as low isotropic energies and smooth light curves , but differ in some aspects .",
    "for example , grb 980425 and grb 031203 have shorter durations and higher @xmath19 s than xrf 060218 and xrf 100316d .",
    "the underlying physical processes that result in these differences are not well understood . through supernova modeling , it is found that grb 980425 and grb 031203 have a progenitor star massive enough to form a black hole @xcite , while xrf 060218 has a less massive progenitor that most plausibly produces a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the luminosity and the duration of xrf 100316d are consistent with the radiation from a neutron star with a dipole magnetic field @xmath122 g and a rotation period @xmath1 ms .",
    "this seems to point towards a hypothesis that two types of central engines define the apparent dichotomy of the sn - associated ll - grbs , i.e. black hole engines give rise to ",
    "shorter \" and  harder \" grbs such as grb 980425 and grb 031203 , while magnetar engines give rise to very long and soft xrfs such as xrf 060218 and xrf 100316d .    adding in sn data",
    "makes the scenario more complicated .",
    "although sn 2006aj associated with xrf 060218 does not conflict with a slow magnetar central engine , sn 2010bh associated with xrf 100316d may be too energetic to be interpreted with a slow magnetar central engine . if it is confirmed that the kinetic energy of sn 2010bh is in excess of @xmath123 erg , neither the neutrino energy nor the magnetar spin energy ( @xmath124 erg ) are adequate to power the sn . a salient feature of the dipole spindown formula ( eq.[[eq : e_inj ] ] ) is that if one shifts the time zero point ( e.g. @xmath125 ) , the spindown law still applies , with the initial angular frequency re - defined as @xmath126 , and the characteristic spindown time scale re - defined as @xmath127 .",
    "this suggests that the observed plateau feature can be still interpreted if the initial period is much shorter than 10 ms , say , @xmath128 ms , if the time zero point is much earlier than @xmath15 s ( i.e. @xmath70 ) .",
    "this is because a power - law decay light curve may show an artificial plateau in the log - log space , if the zero time is mis - placed to a later epoch @xcite .",
    "within such a scenario , a nascent magnetar was born with an initial period @xmath128 ms at @xmath129 s. its intial dipole radiation was trapped by the envelope of the progenitor and could not escape .",
    "this spindown energy gives enough impetus to explode the star and power the energetic sn 2010bh .",
    "after a significant delay ( @xmath130 s to spin down from 1 ms to 10 ms for @xmath122 g ) , the magnetar wind finally managed to escape as a relativistic poynting - flux - dominated outflow .",
    "an observer noticed the jet emission only around @xmath70 .",
    "the above argument also applies to the model of fallback accretion onto a nascent black hole .",
    "with such a hypothesis , one may envision a unified picture to understand the diversity of grb / sn associations , by invoking a variety of initial powers and the delay times between the core collapse and the emergence of the relativistic jet from the star .",
    "the speculation is the following :    * to produce an energetic sn / luminous grb ( e.g. grb 030329/sn 2003dh ) , the central engine is powerful ( a black hole with an accretion disk or a rapidly spinning magnetar ) and the relativistic outflow can break out the progenitor soon enough when the engine is still working effectively . * to produce an energetic sn / underluminous grb ( e.g. grb 980425/sn 1998bw , grb 031203/sn 2003lw , and xrf",
    "100316d / sn 2010bh ) , the central engine is initially powerful , but it takes time for the relativistic wind to emerge from the star . as it breaks out the star , the central engine already fades down with a decreased power .",
    "the longer , softer xrfs are probably powered by a magnetar , while the shorter , harder grbs are probably powered by a black hole . * to produce a less - energetic sn / underluminous grb ( e.g. xrf 060218/sn 2006aj ) ,",
    "the central engine is a slow magnetar with an initial rotation energy less than @xmath131 ergs .",
    "the emergence of the relativistic outflow can be prompt or somewhat ( but not significantly ) delayed .",
    "finally , a straightforward expectation from the speculation that xrf 100316d outflow is poynting - flux - dominated is that the prompt emission should be linearly polarized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the polarimetry measurements of events such as xrf 100316d and xrf 060218 would provide a criterion to differentiate this model from the shock breakout model , which does not predict a strong polarization signal .",
