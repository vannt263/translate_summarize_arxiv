    "this note reports the averaged mass of the top quark ( @xmath4 ) obtained by combining the most precise published and preliminary tevatron measurements of its mass at the tevatron .",
    "this updates the combination presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite provides a detailed description of the systematic uncertainties . in march 2014 ,",
    "the cdf , d atlas and cms collaborations also provided a combination of their most precise top - quark mass measurements  @xcite .",
    "the cdf and d  collaborations have performed several direct measurements of the top - quark mass using data collected at the tevatron proton - antiproton collider located at the fermi national accelerator laboratory .",
    "the pioneering measurements were first based on approximately @xmath5 of  data  @xcite collected from 1992 to 1996 that included results from @xmath6  ( all - jets ) , @xmath7  ( @xmath8+jets ) , and @xmath9  ( @xmath10 ) channels , where @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "decays of @xmath13 followed by @xmath14 are included in the direct @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels .",

    "the cdf analysis based upon charged - particle tracking for exploiting the transverse decay length of @xmath18-tagged jets ( @xmath19 ) and the transverse momentum of electrons and muons from @xmath20 boson decays ( @xmath21 ) using data corresponding to a luminosity of 1.9  @xmath22  @xcite , has no plans for an update .    with respect to the march 2013 tevatron combination @xcite",
    ", the  cdf measurements in the @xmath10 and all - jets channels have been updated using their full  data  @xcite .",
    "the now published  cdf measurements in the @xmath8+jets channel@xcite and @xmath23+jets ( met ) channel@xcite are unchanged .",
    "the measurement based on charged - particle tracking  @xcite was incorporated as described in the past combinations  @xcite .",
    "possible correlation with the @xmath8+jets channel is discussed in that same reference .",
    "the   d  measurement in the @xmath8+jets channel has been updated using the full  data  @xcite .",
    "this result is from spring 2014 and was just accepted for publication in phys .",
    "the measurement in the @xmath10 channel is published and unchanged  @xcite .",
    "the tevatron average @xmath4  is obtained by combining five published  measurements  @xcite with five published   results  @xcite and two preliminary  cdf results  @xcite .",
    "this combination supersedes previous combinations  .",
    "the definition and evaluation of the systematic uncertainties and of the correlations among channels , experiments , and tevatron runs is the outcome of many years of joint effort between the cdf and d  collaborations that is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in all measurements in the present combination ,",
    "the analyses are calibrated to the monte carlo ( mc ) top - quark mass definition .",
    "it is expected that the difference between the mc mass definition and the formal pole mass of the top quark is below 1  gev  @xcite .",
    "the input measurements and uncertainty categories used in the combination are detailed in sections  [ sec : inputs ] and  [ sec : uncertainty ] , respectively .",
    "the correlations assumed in the combination are discussed in section  [ sec : corltns ] , and the resulting tevatron average top - quark mass is given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a summary is presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the twelve measurements of @xmath4  used in this combination are shown in table  [ tab : inputs ] .",
    "the  measurements all have relatively large statistical uncertainties and their systematic uncertainties are dominated by the total jet energy scale ( jes ) uncertainty . in both cdf and d",
    "take advantage of the larger @xmath24  samples available and employ new analysis techniques to reduce both of these uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the  d  analysis in the @xmath8+jets channel and the  cdf analyses in the @xmath8+jets , all - jets , and met channels constrain the response of light - quark jets using the kinematic information from @xmath25 decays ( the so - called _ in situ _ calibration )  @xcite .",
    "residual jes uncertainties associated with @xmath26 and @xmath27 dependencies as well as uncertainties specific to the response of @xmath18 jets are treated separately .",
    "the  d  @xmath10 measurement uses the jes determined in the @xmath8+jets channel through the _ in situ _ calibration  @xcite .",
    ".summary of the measurements used to determine the tevatron average @xmath4 .",
    "integrated luminosity ( @xmath28 ) has units of @xmath29 , and all other numbers are in @xmath30 .",
    "the uncertainty categories and their correlations are described in section  [ sec : uncertainty ] .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty and the total uncertainty are obtained by adding the relevant contributions in quadrature .",
    "the symbols `` n / a '' stands for `` not applicable '' , `` n / e '' for `` not evaluated '' . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : two_observables ]    in the same way , we can also fit two physical observables : the mass measured in cdf and the one measured at d  : @xmath31  and @xmath32  separately .",
    "the result of these combinations is shown in table  [ tab : two_observables ] .",
    "the chi - squared value including correlations is @xmath33 corresponding to a probability of 6.3% .",
    "an update was presented of the combination of measurements of the mass of the top quark from the tevatron experiments cdf and d .",
    "this preliminary combination includes five published  measurements , seven published  measurements , and two preliminary  measurements . most of these measurements are performed with the full data . taking into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations , the preliminary result for the tevatron average is @xmath34 , where the total uncertainty is obtained assuming gaussian systematic uncertainties .",
    "the central value is 1.14gev/@xmath35 higher than the tevatron spring 2013 average  @xcite of @xmath36gev/@xmath35 . adding in quadrature the statistical and systematic uncertainties yields a total uncertainty of @xmath37 that represents an improvement of @xmath38 .",
    "compared to the world average , the central value of this combination is @xmath39 higher and its precision is 16% better .    the mass of the top quark is now known with a relative precision of 0.37% , limited by the systematic uncertainties , which are dominated by the uncertainty on _ in situ _ calibration and signal modeling .",
    "this result will be further improved when all analysis channels from cdf and d  using the full run  ii data are optimized in their treatment of their systematic uncertainties .",
