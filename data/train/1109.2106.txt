    "( of claim ) let @xmath21 , @xmath76 and let @xmath77 be the matrix representing the automorphism taking @xmath74 to @xmath45 .",
    "suppose @xmath78 and let @xmath70 , @xmath79 be the order of @xmath80 in @xmath5 so that we may write @xmath81 .",
    "by lemma [ lemma : autolemma ] the automorphism @xmath77 must have the form @xmath82\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 is relatively prime to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , assuming that @xmath84 , @xmath85    since @xmath74 is a representative element , for any non - zero term @xmath86 if @xmath87 , then the order of @xmath86 in @xmath30 is less than the order of @xmath80 in @xmath5 ; i.e. @xmath88 . hence , @xmath89 and @xmath90 divides @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath92 , then @xmath93 and @xmath90 divides @xmath94 . thus @xmath95    since @xmath83 is relatively prime to @xmath0 @xmath96    is also relatively prime to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , when @xmath80 is non - zero , @xmath97 , @xmath98 relatively prime to @xmath0 .",
    "however @xmath45 is a representative element therefore @xmath24 is a power of @xmath0 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "an identical argument shows that @xmath101 when @xmath24 is non - zero .",
    "therefore for all @xmath12 , @xmath100 and so @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath1 is any finite abelian @xmath0-group , then every element of @xmath1 is automorphically equivalent to a unique representative element in @xmath67 , which is also a representative element for @xmath1 .",
    "finally , if @xmath7 is any finitely generated abelian group , then we have established that any element of @xmath7 is automorphically equivalent to element satisfying the first two conditions of the definition of representative element .",
    "it can be shown that any element satisfying the first two conditions is automorphically equivalent to one that satisfies the third condition and has the same number or fewer nonzero terms . as an illustration",
    "consider the following example .",
    "let @xmath102 and let @xmath103 $ ] be any element of @xmath104 satisfying the first two conditions of the definition of a representative element but not the third . then @xmath105 \\left[\\begin{array}{c}p^{l_1 } \\\\ p^{l_2 } \\\\ kp \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{array}{c}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ kp \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] and",
    "so @xmath45 is automorphically equivalent to an element satisfying the third condition of our definition and has strictly fewer nonzero terms .",
    "having completed the main result we will now show how to count the number of representative elements in a given finite abelian group .",
    "let @xmath106 where @xmath23 for all @xmath12 be a repeat - free @xmath0-group and @xmath107 be an automorphism class representative in @xmath67 .",
    "the non - zero terms of @xmath45 are both increasing and order increasing , thus for @xmath108 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 are non - zero terms of @xmath45 we know that @xmath109 and @xmath110 hence , @xmath111 we shall refer to the value @xmath112 as the _ gap _ between the terms @xmath5 and @xmath30 of @xmath67 , and in particular we will denote @xmath113 by @xmath114 . as an immediate consequence of the above conclusion we know that if @xmath70 is non - zero , then either @xmath71 is zero or we have at most @xmath115 choices for @xmath116 . further , if @xmath117 and @xmath118 , then one or the other of these two terms must be zero . therefore ,",
    "if the gap between two terms of a group is one , then in every automorphism class representative at least one of the terms will be zero .    for motivation",
    "let us count the number of automorphism class representatives in @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "we begin by counting the number of automorphism classes with a given number of non - zero terms .",
    "@xmath121                    we have shown above that this is true for a group with three terms .",
    "we proceed by induction on the number of terms in @xmath67 . by induction the group @xmath130 has @xmath131 automorphism classes of elements .",
    "this is also the number of automorphism class representatives in @xmath67 in which the @xmath132 term is 0 .",
    "therefore we complete the proposition with the following claim .",
    "( of claim )  if @xmath136 , then there are @xmath137 automorphism class representatives in which the second term is the only non - zero term and @xmath138 in which the first and second terms are the only non - zero terms .",
    "therefore the number of automorphism class representatives in which the second term is the last non - zero term is      now let @xmath140 , if @xmath141 and the @xmath64 term is the last non - zero term of an element prior to the @xmath63 term , then there are @xmath142 non - zero choices for the value of the @xmath63 term and by induction @xmath143automorphism class representatives in which the @xmath63 term is the last non - zero term and the @xmath64 term is the second to last non - zero term . so letting @xmath144 and summing over all @xmath12 between @xmath145 and @xmath32 , the total number of automorphism classes in which the @xmath63 term is the last non - zero term is @xmath146 however for all @xmath147 : @xmath148 and @xmath149 so we may rewrite the previous equation as @xmath150 and since @xmath151 we get      thus proving the claim",
    "in order to finish the proposition we observe that , by induction , the number of automorphism classes in which the @xmath132 term is zero is @xmath153 and from the claim the number of automorphism classes in which the @xmath132 term is non - zero is @xmath154 and the sum of these two gives the desired result ."
