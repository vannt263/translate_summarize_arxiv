    "this paper revolves around the following question : what does a @xmath0 db increase in the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) buy in an outage limited multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) channel ? in an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) setting , it is well known that a @xmath0 db increase in snr translates into an extra bit in channel capacity in the high snr regime .",
    "the scenario considered in this paper , however , is more involved .",
    "we study an outage limited channel where the randomness of the instantaneous mutual information results in a non - zero lower bound on the probability of error , for non - zero constant transmission rates .",
    "hence , a fundamental tradeoff between the throughput , as quantified by the transmission rate , and reliability , as quantified by the so - called outage probability , arises .",
    "our work explores this tradeoff in the high snr regime .    to be more specific ,",
    "we consider a mimo wireless communication system with @xmath1 transmit and @xmath2 receive antennas .",
    "we adopt a quasi - static flat - fading setup where the path gains remain constant over @xmath3 consecutive symbol - intervals ( _ i.e. , _ a block ) , but change independently from one block to another .",
    "we further assume a coherent communication model implying the availability of channel state information ( csi ) only at the receiver . under these assumptions ,",
    "the channel input - output relation is given by : @xmath4 in , @xmath5 has entries @xmath6 representing the signal received at antenna @xmath7 , @xmath8 has entries @xmath9 denoting the signal transmitted by antenna @xmath10 , @xmath11 has entries @xmath12 which represents the path gain between receive antenna @xmath13 and transmit antenna @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represents the unit - variance additive white gaussian noise .",
    "we model @xmath16 as i.i.d zero - mean and unit - variance complex gaussian random variables .",
    "finally , @xmath17 corresponds to the snr at each receive antenna .",
    "our work builds on zheng and tse s formulation of the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff @xcite .",
    "this formulation assumes a family of space - time codes @xmath18 indexed by their operating snr @xmath17 , such that the code @xmath19 has rate @xmath20 , in bits per channel use ( bpcu ) , and error probability @xmath21 . for this family , the multiplexing gain @xmath22 and the diversity gain @xmath23",
    "are defined by . ]",
    "@xmath24 the optimal diversity - multiplexing tradeoff yields the maximum possible diversity gain for every value of @xmath22 .",
    "the main result of @xcite is summarized in the following theorem :    [ zheng - tse - th1 ] the optimal diversity gain for the coherent quasi - static mimo channel with @xmath1 transmit and @xmath2 receive antennas , at multiplexing gain @xmath22 , is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the piecewise linear function joining the points @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , there exists a code that achieves @xmath29 for all block lengths @xmath30 .    in the sequel",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath31 and @xmath32 . to motivate our work",
    ", we use the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff to make a first attempt towards answering our central question on the utility of a @xmath0 db snr gain in quasi - static mimo channels . using the extreme points of the tradeoff curve ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , a * reasonable * conjecture is    1 .   at high enough snrs",
    ", one can fix the transmission rate and obtain @xmath35 orders of decay in the outage probability ( on a log - log scale ) for every @xmath36 db gain in snr .",

    "[ fig : outage_2x2_4,8 ] is shown to approach the asymptotic value of @xmath39 , on the log - log scale , as predicted by the first part of our conjecture . the _",
    "surprising _ observation , however , is that for a constant outage probability a @xmath40 db gain in snr is needed to obtain an @xmath41 bpcu increase in the throughput ( to avoid fractions of a db , the figure shows a @xmath42 db spacing for a @xmath43 bpcu throughput increase ) .",
    "this contrasts the second part of our conjecture which predicts the need for only @xmath0 db for every @xmath44 bpcu .",
    "more interestingly , this @xmath40 db _ horizontal spacing _ seems to persist as the snr increases .",
    "2 .   fig .",
    "[ fig : outage_2x2_28,32 ] , on the other hand , comes in close agreement with the second part of our conjecture . here , the horizontal spacing , for a @xmath44 bpcu increase in throughput , is seen to be @xmath0 db .",
    "the disagreement in this case , however , is exhibited in the fact that the slope of the outage probability curves , corresponding to fixed rates , seems to _ stabilize _ for a wide range of snrs at a value of @xmath44 ( instead of @xmath43 ) .",
    "3 .   repeating the experiment for different values of @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 reveals the same trends , i.e. , 1 ) our conjecture seems to offer _ partially _ accurate predictions in certain _ operating regions _ and 2 ) except for the @xmath45 channel , the predictions for the outage probability rate of decay and horizontal spacing are _ never simultaneously _ accurate .",
    "overall , these disagreements clearly disprove our _ naive _ conjecture .",
    "however , it seems that the conjecture is _ not completely _ false as it offers some accurate predictions , at least in certain operating regions .",
    "inspired by these observations , this paper aims at developing a better understanding of the fundamental throughput - reliability tradeoff in outage limited mimo channels .",
    "it turns out that such an understanding requires a more general formulation which is not limited by the multiplexing gain notion as defined in ( [ multiplexing - rd ] ) .",
    "in particular , the multiplexing gain notion limits the scenarios of interest to _ asymptotic lines _ on the @xmath46 plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] .",
    "our formulation , on the other hand , allows for investigating more general scenarios by relaxing this constraint .",
    "specifically , we shed more light on the relationship between the three quantities @xmath47 ) , in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath17 , when @xmath48 it is clear that allows for investigating scenarios defined by arbitrary asymptotic trajectories in the @xmath46 plane where the multiplexing gain is not defined ( fig .  [ fig : trajectory ] depicts such a trajectory ) . as argued in the sequel , this _ freedom _ of walking along arbitrary trajectories , on the @xmath46 plane , is the * key * to obtaining accurate predictions for the outage probability slopes and horizontal spacings in different operating regions . while our characterization is _ rigorous _ only in the asymptotic scenario where snr grows to infinity ( i.e. , @xmath49 )",
    ", we will demonstrate , via numerical results , that it yields very accurate predictions for practically relevant values of snr .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ trt ] ,",
    "we state our main result formulating the throughput - reliability tradeoff ( trt ) for the point - to - point coherent mimo channel , along with a sketch of the main ideas in the proof . in this section",
    ", we also present numerical results and intuitive arguments that demonstrate the utility of our results in predicting the _ behavior _ of outage probability curves in the high snr regime .",
    "section  [ apl ] utilizes the trt to shed more light on the performance of various space - time architectures and further extends our investigation to automatic repeat request ( arq ) channels .",
    "we offer few concluding remarks in section  [ conc ] . in order to enhance the flow of the paper , the proofs",
    "are collected in the appendix .",
    "an outage is defined as the event that the instantaneous mutual information does not support the intended rate , i.e. , @xmath50 notice that the mutual information depends on both the channel realization @xmath51 and the input distribution @xmath52 .",
    "the outage probability @xmath53 is then defined as @xmath54 the following theorem characterizes the relationship between @xmath55 , @xmath17 , and @xmath53 .",
    "[ thrm:1 ] for the @xmath56 mimo channel described by , @xmath57 where @xmath53 denotes the outage probability at rate @xmath55 and snr @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 in , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 moreover , in the degenerate case @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "we refer to @xmath61 as the _ reliability gain coefficient _ and @xmath66 as the _ throughput gain coefficient_.    ( sketch ) our proof follows the same lines as the proof of theorem  [ zheng - tse - th1 ] in @xcite except for the fundamental challenge that the multiplexing gain is not defined here . to handle this challenge ,",
    "we judicially choose the region @xmath67 and find a lower bound on @xmath68 and an upper bound on @xmath69 and show that the two bounds coincide for the choice of @xmath60 and @xmath61 given by ( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) , respectively . the detailed proof is reported in the appendix .",
    "it is immediate to check that if the multiplexing gain is well defined , i.e. , if @xmath70 exists , then theorem  [ thrm:1 ] reduces to theorem  [ zheng - tse - th1 ] . in the more general case",
    ", however , theorem  [ thrm:1 ] replaces the restrictive multiplexing gain notion with the new concept of operating regions @xmath67 .",
    "it is worth noting that every operating region corresponds to a line segment in the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff .",
    "in fact , this correspondence inspires the following observation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the slope of the line segment connecting @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we are now ready to investigate the asymptotic trends of the throughput - reliability tradeoff using theorem  [ thrm:1 ] .",
    "the following discussion hinges on the intuitive interpretation of equation  ( [ eq:3 ] ) . @xmath75 where the approximation in ( [ eq:203 ] ) becomes progressively more accurate as @xmath17 increases .",
    "equation ( [ eq:203 ] ) implies that the slope of the outage curve , for a constant rate , is given by @xmath61 , while the horizontal spacing in db between two outage curves with a @xmath76 rate difference is given by @xmath77 .",
    "the key observation here is that in order to fix the transmission rate ( or outage probability ) , while staying in the same operating region , one * must * deviate from the linear trajectory imposed by the multiplexing gain notion .",
    "the following _ heuristic _ derivation of ( [ eq:54 ] ) and ( [ eq:201 ] ) further illustrates this point . to derive , we start from two approximate relationships obtained from the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff @xmath78 @xmath79 we further approximate @xmath80 with the first two terms of its taylor series expansion , i.e. , @xmath81 now , together with and , gives @xmath82 realizing that the left - hand side of gives the slope of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath61 , and that @xmath83 remains constant over the line segments of @xmath29 , we get .",
    "deriving follows the same lines .",
    "in particular , we first compute the horizontal spacing , @xmath84 , between the outage curves corresponding to rates @xmath55 and @xmath85 . for this purpose",
    ", we use to write @xmath86 then we expand @xmath87 in a way similar to and equate with to get @xmath88 realizing that @xmath89 , and that @xmath90 remains constant over the line segments of @xmath29 , we get .    revisiting our naive conjecture , we can now see that @xmath91 which agrees with the first part , while @xmath92 agrees with the second part .",
    "this explains the _ partial _ correctness of the conjecture and the fact that , except for the @xmath45 mimo channel , the two parts are * never * simultaneously accurate , since they correspond to different operating regions .",
    "we also observe that both the reliability and throughput gain coefficients exhibit a staircase behavior .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that @xmath61 is a decreasing function of @xmath93 , while @xmath94 is an increasing function of @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that , at a fixed rate @xmath55 and for sufficiently large snrs , as @xmath95 increases ( i.e. , @xmath17 decreases ) , the decay rate of @xmath53 decreases and the horizontal spacing between the outage curves corresponding to a fixed rate difference shrinks . in the following",
    ", we present numerical results that validate this observation .    before proceeding to the numerical results , we need the following rule of thump for determining the operating regions , for large but finite values of @xmath17 and @xmath55 , such that the approximation in ( [ eq:203 ] ) is accurate .",
    "the operating point @xmath96 is in operating region @xmath67 if and only if @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a * small * value which determines the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "it is now straightforward to see that the high snr segment of fig .",
    "[ fig : outage_2x2_4,8 ] falls in the region @xmath99 and , indeed , the @xmath43 levels of diversity and @xmath40 db spacing ( for every @xmath44 bpcu throughput increase ) in this figure correspond precisely to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "the slope of the curves and the spacing between them change as the operating point leaves one operating region and enters another .",
    "again , the values of the slopes , spacings , and operating points at which the change occurs ( which can be read from fig .  [ fig : regions_2x2_20 ] ) match nicely with the predictions of the trt as formulated by theorem [ thrm:1 ] .",

    "it should be noted , however , that the tail of the curve corresponding to @xmath109 bpcu is leaving @xmath107 and entering @xmath110 and thus the slope of this curve is larger than @xmath111 ( about 7.7 ) .",
    "for the same reason , the horizontal spacing between the two curves ( almost @xmath36 db ) is larger than the value predicted for @xmath112 ( i.e. , @xmath113 db ) .",
