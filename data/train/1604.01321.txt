    "in particular , some lamb modes , often referred to as backward propagating modes in the literature , naturally display a negative phase velocity  @xcite .",
    "these modes originate from the repulsion between two dispersion branches having close cut - off frequencies , corresponding to a longitudinal and a transverse thickness mode of the same symmetry .",
