    "for @xmath24 , the @xmath5 magnetic edge states become dispersive , while for @xmath18 an energy gap becomes created around the bipolar region in the spectrum of the magnetic edge states .",
    "similar features can be found when the zeeman spin splitting is finite , because in the nonuniform field of step shape the zeeman effect behaves as the step potential .",
    "finally , we suggest an interferometry setup formed in a graphene ribbon for experimental study . in this setup , the magnetic edge states can provide partial paths of a full aharonov - bohm interference loop , therefore the properties of the magnetic edge states such as the gap of their energy spectra can be investigated .",
