    "the conditional luminosity function ( clf ; yang et al . 2003b , 2005 ) , or the luminosity and color distribution of galaxies within a dark matter halo of mass @xmath30 , @xmath31 , captures important astrophysical information that determines how the large scale structure galaxy distribution is related to that of the dark matter .",
    "as shown in cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005b ; cooray 2005a ) , a simple empirical model for the clf , when combined with the halo mass function , describes the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) accurately ; this empirical model recovers the schechter ( 1976 ) form of the galaxy lf given by @xmath32 with a characteristic luminosity @xmath33 and a power - law slope at the faint end of @xmath34 .",
    "a basic ingredient in this model is the relation between central galaxy luminosity and the mass of the halo in which the galaxy is found  the @xmath1 relation of cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005a ) .",
    "the characteristic luminosity of the schechter function is the luminosity when the scatter in the @xmath1 relation , at a given halo mass , dominates over the increase in the luminosity with mass or when @xmath35 where @xmath3 is the log - normal dispersion in the @xmath1 relation .",
    "given the observed dispersion , we find @xmath36 m@xmath6 and @xmath33 , corresponding to @xmath37 , agrees with estimates from observations .",
    "the faint - end power - law slope of the lf is a combination of the power - law slope of the @xmath1 relation at @xmath38 and the slope of the dark matter halo mass function .",
    "the combination puts a strict bound that @xmath39 , consistent with observations that indicate @xmath40 ( blanton et al . 2004 ; huang et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 relation , as appropriate for galaxies at low - redshifts and in the k - band , was established in cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005a ) from a combination of weak galaxy - galaxy lensing data ( e.g. , sheldon et al .",

    "the shape of the @xmath1 relation , where luminosities grow rapidly with increasing mass but flattens at a mass scale around @xmath42 10@xmath43 m@xmath6 is best explained through dissipationless merging history of central galaxies ( cooray & milosavljevi 2005a ) .",
    "a large fraction of these bright galaxies , in centers of groups and clusters , are early - type and observational evidences for dry mergers as a dominant process in the formation and evolution of massive , luminous early - type galaxies are now beginning to appear ( bell et al . 2005 ) . in cooray ( 2005b )",
    ", the approach based on clfs was extended to higher redshifts and a comparison with galaxy lfs observed out to redshifts 2 and higher , with surveys such as deep2 ( davis et al .",
    "2003 ; willmer et al . 2005 ; faber et all . 2005 ) and combo-17 ( wolf et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; bell et al .",
    "2004 ) , allowed constraints on the redshift evolution of the @xmath1 relation .    beyond the total galaxy lf , the empirical modeling approach based on clfs",
    "can easily be extended to consider statistics of galaxy types as well .",
    "for example , in cooray ( 2005a ) , we studied the environmental dependence of galaxy colors , broadly divided into blue- and red - galaxies given the bimodal nature of the color distribution ( e.g. , baldry et al .",
    "2004 ; balogh et al .",
    "there , we described early- and late - type conditional lfs measured with 2dfgrs as a function of the galaxy overdensity ( croton et al .",
    "2004 ) based on an empirical description of the fraction of late- and early - type galaxies relative to the total number of galaxies in dark matter halos as a function of the halo mass . with an increasing fraction of early - type galaxies as the halo mass is increased , the simple analytical model considered in cooray ( 2005a ) explains why the lf of galaxies in dense environments is dominated by red galaxies .",
    "while lfs are well produced by this analytical model , with statistics related to early- and late - type galaxies parameterized by analytical functions , it is timely to consider how this model compares with higher order statistics of the galaxy distribution such as those related to the clustering pattern of galaxies .",
    "a comparison to data could also provide additional constraints on ingredients related to this model and especially those related to clfs of central and satellite galaxies .",
    "while numerous predictions and limited comparisons to data exist in the literature on how well clustering measurements can constrain galaxy properties , these are mostly considered in terms of the simple halo occupation model involving the number of galaxies in a dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass , @xmath44 ( e.g. , seljak 2000 ; scoccimarro et al . 2001 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; cooray 2002 ; berlind et al .",
    "2003 ; zehavi et al . 2004 ; zheng et al .",

    "the same approach of constraining the halo occupation number based on galaxy clustering data has been applied at redshifts @xmath42 0.6 with combo-17 ( phleps et al .",
    "2005 ) and , more frequently , at @xmath42 3 and higher using lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) and similar drop - out samples ( e.g. , bullock et al .",
    "2002 ; lee et al .",
    "2005 ) . since the halo occupation number is an integral function and treats all galaxies the same , regardless of the color or the galaxy luminosity , meaningful models that account for differences in galaxy physical parameters can not easily be considered .",
    "it is also no surprise that the halo model , based on the halo occupation number alone , can not be used to model the lf of galaxies .",
    "even with clustering statistics , due to differences involving luminosities of galaxies in different samples and potential variations with redshift when defining galaxy samples , constraints on the simple halo occupation number at different redshifts can not be compared with each other easily .",
    "the best approach to overcome these drawbacks is to make use of the conditional occupation number or , more appropriately , clf as the fundamental quantity when describing galaxy statistics ( yang et al . 2003b , 2005 ) .",
    "the clfs extend the analytical halo model ( see , cooray & sheth 2002 for a review ) by dividing the mean number of galaxies to a distribution in galaxy luminosity such that @xmath45 and using @xmath46 to model observed statistics rather than @xmath47 ( yang et al . 2003b , 2005 ) .",
    "similarly , the same approach can be extended for galaxy color or any other property as one can easily define the subsample of galaxies related to that property , but with the restriction that the whole sample be contained within the total lf .",
    "thus , the approach based on clfs is useful when comparing with measurements conditioned in terms of galaxy properties such as the luminosity or the color . with wide - field surveys , where statistics of a few hundred thousand galaxies or more are easily available",
    ", the division of measurable statistics to galaxy properties is now common . given the existence of measurements already , for example clustering properties as a function of the galaxy luminosity ( zehavi et al .",

    ", we extend our previous discussions related to clfs ( cooray 2005a , 2005b ) , where we modeled the lf , to study galaxy clustering and make predictions for clustering statistics at the two - point level involving projected correlation functions as a function of the redshift . these models are then compared with existing results from surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al , 2000 ; zehavi et al .",

    "a previous attempt related to extracting properties of the galaxy sample in 2dfgrs through clfs is described in yang et al .",
    "in this analysis , authors made use of a priori assumed schechter function shape for the clf ( yang et al .",
    "2003b ) , though we make no such assumptions here .",
    "in fact , galaxy cluster or group lf data suggest that schechter function shapes are not the appropriate form to describe their luminosity distribution , given the central galaxy .",
    "a combination of a log - normal component and a power - law fits the data best , consistent with the clf models we have suggested .",
    "motivated by yang et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , yan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the same clf description involving schechter function shapes to compare galaxy clustering between 2dfgrs and deep2 and suggested that the clf does not strongly evolve with redshift .",
    "while we make use of sdss clustering measurements in our analysis here , we also note that an attempt has been made to establish @xmath46 based on differences in halo occupation models , as a function of luminosity , when describing clustering statistics as a function of the galaxy luminosity ( zehavi et al .",
    "the modeling approach we use here involves the clf as the basic parameter to be extracted from the data and provides a consistent way to model both the galaxy lf and clustering statistics of the same galaxy sample and a mechanism to extend the same underlying clf model to describe galaxy statistics at higher redshifts .",
    "since clfs are recovered , we can easily integrate over the luminosity to calculate halo occupation numbers allowing an easy comparison to previous analyses .",
    "our approach also demonstrates why and how certain parameters related to clfs are sensitive to lfs , such as those related to central galaxies , while others , especially those involving satellite galaxies , can be determined better with the non - linear 1-halo part of the correlation function .",
    "this is consistent with suggestions in the literature , that , for example , halo occupation statistics  which are dominated by satellite galaxies  are better constrained with clustering of galaxies within groups ( e.g. , coil et al . 2005 ; collister & lahav 2005 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we will outline basic ingredients in the empirical model for clfs and how galaxy clustering statistics can be derived from clfs .",
    "we refer the reader to cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005b ) and cooray ( 2005a ) for initial discussions related to this empirical modeling approach and to cooray ( 2005b ) for details on the extension to higher redshifts .",

    "we encourage extending clustering studies of galaxies to fainter magnitudes to obtain a better handle on their properties and to extend clfs down to fainter luminosities than possible so far , though due to reasons that clustering statistics are not sensitive to central galaxies , it is unlikely such measurements alone would be helpful .    as shown in fig .  15 , the galaxy lf also provides best constraints on parameters related to galaxy types that appear in halo centers .",

    "thus , the increase in the total number of satellite galaxies , or more appropriately in the context of clfs , the satellite luminosity , is compensated by the decrease in @xmath11 so as to conserve the total satellite luminosity . to understand this further",

    "while there is a small difference between the two samples , given the large redshift difference , 0.6 and 4 for combo-17 and subaru data respectively , it is safe to conclude that we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the sample - averaged total luminosity of satellites .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with yan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who compared clustering of galaxies in 2dfgrs at low redshifts and in deep2 and suggested no evidence for evolution between now and a redshift of unity in the total clf as parameterized by yang et al .",
    "( 2003b ) . either confirming or refuting the redshift evolution could help in understanding how satellite galaxies merge within halos to form central galaxies , whose luminosities do evolve with redshift .",
    "given that clustering measurements by coil et al .",
    "( 2004 ) involved only a subset of the final deep2 galaxy sample , the complete analysis should improve the estimate of @xmath227 at a redshift of 1 , which when combined with sdss and combo-17 , should improve an estimate on the redshift evolution of @xmath227 compared to the estimate here .    in figure  20 , we present the comparison between constraints on @xmath11 and @xmath85 parameters from sdss and subaru and combo-17 and subaru respectively .",
    "while constraints on @xmath228 show no evidence for evolution , at the 1@xmath3 confidence level , we find that @xmath11 and @xmath85 parameters at @xmath229 and @xmath90 differ each other suggesting that these parameters in fact show some evolution . the fact that these parameters show differences ( as in figure  20 ) , while a parameter such as @xmath227 remain the same may , at the first instance , contradictory .",
    "the difference in parameters such as @xmath11 and @xmath85 between low and high redshifts comes from the difference in halo mass functions between redshifts .",
    "as the halo mass function evolves , there are no high mass halos , and satellites , if exist , should be appearing at a lower mass halo .",
    "this is the general trend we see in figure  20 .",
    "if that s the case , one could argue that @xmath227 should decrease as a function of increasing redshift .",
    "we do not find this behavior as halos at a high redshift gets assigned brighter central galaxies than at a low redshift due to the redshift evolution in the @xmath1 relation .",
    "this anti - hierarchical behavior is consistent with what is generally referred to in the literature as `` down - sizing '' or mass - dependent luminosity evolution where brighter galaxies form first than less luminous galaxies . since",
    "small halos are assigned brighter central galaxies at high redshift , given our description of the clf , it is natural that such halos end up with brighter satellites as well , relative to a same mass halo at a lower redshift .",
    "thus , while @xmath11 and @xmath85 change with redshift , @xmath227 remains the same .",
    "note that in our models of the clf , we have not a priori assumed this behavior .",
    "in fact , clf parameters may take any value , and we only note this behavior because of the model fitting to the data .",
    "thus , our model fit results provide support for apparent brightening of galaxies at high redshifts both in the case of central galaxies , as discussed in cooray 2002b , and satellites , as discussed here in terms of the clustering statistics .    in figure  21 ,",
    "we show constraints on @xmath85 and @xmath11 as a function of the galaxy luminosity . for clarity , we only plot constraints",
    "when @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "these constraints reveal , though not significant , a trend in 1@xmath3 constraint on @xmath85 as a function of the luminosity bin such that as galaxy luminosities are increased , @xmath85 is also increased .",
    "such an increase is heavily favored in halo occupation model fits of zehavi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , though , we find that large uncertainties in our model parameters related to clfs do not allow us to establish the same dependence of @xmath232 , the minimum mass for the appearance of a central galaxy in zehavi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with galaxy luminosity here for the appearance of satellites through our model parameter @xmath85 as a function of luminosity .",
    "as stated in zehavi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the halo occupation models shown there are not unique and it could be that the largely increasing values of @xmath232 as a function of galaxy luminosity is partly accounted through unusually large power - law slopes in the halo occupation number models suggested there .",
    "it is likely that this result can be further improved with galaxy - galaxy lensing studies , and as we discuss later , more likely with cross - clustering between faint and bright galaxies .    instead of using galaxy clustering data to establish the mass scale at which satellite galaxies begins to appear , as a function of the luminosity",
    ", one can establish the same relation directly from the data if galaxy sample can be divided to a distribution of galaxy groups and clusters , with some mechanism to estimate the halo mass of that halo . following this approach , we make use of a suggested catalog of galaxy groups in sdss by weinmann et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and use the luminosity distribution to study the minimum luminosity of galaxies in these halos as a function of the halo mass . in figure  22 , we summarize our results where we consider close to @xmath233 groups and clusters in sdss .",
    "the halo masses are estimated based on the total luminosity of the halo , though due to small number of galaxies when halo masses are below a few times @xmath234 m@xmath6 , the mass estimates may become highly uncertain .",
    "the catalog may also be affected by uncertain galaxy assignments , especially when a galaxy that is parter of a large mass halo such as cluster gets assigned systematically to a lower mass galaxy group . ignoring these complications , which affect the low mass end , we see a trend in minimum luminosity with halo mass .",
    "this trend can be roughly described as @xmath235 .",
    "galaxies with luminosities greater than -21 only begin to appear in dark matter halos with mass above @xmath236 m@xmath6 , while the mass limit for galaxies with luminosities brighter than -17 in the @xmath29-band is below 10@xmath237 m@xmath6 .",
    "the result we derived earlier where we suggest that mass limit is @xmath238 m@xmath6 is for the whole sample and is generally weighted by galaxies in magnitude bins between -19 to -21 ( see , figure  8 for example ) .",
    "the result based on clustering analysis is thus generally consistent with the direct estimate from the cluster catalog . in figure  23",
    ", we plot the constraints on minimum halo mass and the power - law slope for individual bins in luminosity between -18 and -22 ( dashed lines ) . if we make use of the general result that @xmath239 , then we find that @xmath240 at the 3@xmath3 confidence level .",
    "returning to figure  21 , we then see the clear trend between minimum luminosity and the halo mass even based on galaxy clustering .    as a further application of our results",
    ", our clfs can be easily used to estimate the average fraction of satellite galaxies in dark matter halos over a given luminosity range , @xmath241 : @xmath242 in fig .",
    "23 , we show contours of constant @xmath241 for several luminosity bins between -18 and -22 in @xmath243 as appropriate for sdss as a function of @xmath11 and m@xmath210 . for reference",
    ", we also plot the constraint from sdss clustering data on these two parameters as a function of the luminosity bin .    to estimate the satellite fraction as a function of the luminosity bin , instead of @xmath85 and @xmath11 as parameters , we determine the likelihood for the single parameter @xmath241 directly from clustering data .",
    "these results are summarized in figure  24 .",
    "the satellite fraction is in each of the bins is @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for galaxies with @xmath29-band luminosities of -22 to -21 , -20 to -21 , -19 to -20 , and -18 to -19 , respectively ( see , also , figure  22 ) . as we discussed with respect to figure  21",
    ", there is an indication that @xmath244 to be consistent with the minimum luminosity of galaxies as a function of the halo mass .",
    "thus , if @xmath245 , the satellite fractions are @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 , for galaxies in luminosity bins of -21 to -22 , -20 to -21 , -19 to -20 , and -18 to -19 , respectively .    though our fractions are slightly lower , considering the errors , these fractions are fully consistent with the values suggested in mandelbaum et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in three luminosity bins based on an analysis of galaxy - galaxy lensing data with numerical simulations .",
    "given that current data allow a large range of satellite fractions , for most practical purposes , one can assume that the satellite fraction is a constant with a value around 0.1 to 0.2 in luminosity bins between -18 and -21 in @xmath243 for general prediction calculations ( e.g. , slosar et al . 2005 ) , though when estimating cosmological parameters or other parameter constraints , it may be best to take into account suggested variations . unlike calculations in mandelbaum et al .",
    "( 2004 ) or slosar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , in the present description of galaxy statistics with clfs , satellite fraction is not an independent free parameter and is only determined to the extent that parameters related to the satellite clf are known .",
    "thus , we need not establish the satellite fraction separately .    involved with the above expression for @xmath213 , in equation  [ eqn : lsatave ] , is the probability of halo mass to a host a galaxy with luminosity @xmath53 at a redshift @xmath55 given by @xmath250 these probabilities are shown in left and right panels of fig .  25 for a faint and a bright sample of galaxies at three different redshifts , respectively .",
    "the two panels , when combined , show the mass - dependent redshift evolution of the galaxy luminosity following cooray ( 2005b ) .",
    "luminous galaxies at high redshifts are found at lower mass halos than dark matter halo masses that corresponds to the same galaxy luminosity today . at the faint - end , @xmath251 , regardless of the redshift , faint galaxies are essentially found in dark matter halos with a factor of 2 less range in mass , though at low redshifts , a 30% or more fraction of low - luminous galaxies could be satellites in more massive halos .    in fig .",
    "26 , we show the same probabilities divided into three magnitude bins as a function of redshift in four panels . when @xmath252 , at @xmath253 , galaxies are primarily in dark matter halos of mass @xmath254 m@xmath6 . in comparison ,",
    "such galaxies are central galaxies in groups and clusters today with masses above 10@xmath255 m@xmath6 .",
    "the same probabilities have been estimated based on galaxy - galaxy weak lensing studies in sdss by mandelbaum et al .",
    "the mean mass estimates , at a given luminosity bin , and the dispersion of the mean mass based on probabilities shown in fig .",
    "26 are in agreement with estimates by mandelbaum et al .",
    "for example , probabilities shown in fig .",
    "26 suggest that the mean halo mass for the bin -21 to -22 in @xmath243 is about @xmath256 h@xmath51 m@xmath6 which agrees with the mass estimate of @xmath257 h@xmath51 m@xmath6 based on nfw fits to galaxy - galaxy lensing data .",
    "since galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements trace the galaxy  dark matter correlation function while our estimates are based solely on galaxy - galaxy clustering , these agreements suggest that to the extent probed by current data galaxy distribution traces dark matter as assumed in these halo - based models .",
    "we will , however , test this assumption in detail in an upcoming analysis .    at high redshifts ,",
    "the halo masses are again consistent with various prior estimates .",
    "for example , in conroy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the dark matter halo masses of @xmath258 galaxies are measured based on velocity profiles with a halo mass estimate of @xmath259 h@xmath51 m@xmath6 .",
    "our probability distribution function for halo mass in this luminosity bin and at a redshift of unity suggests a mean halo mass of @xmath260 h@xmath51 m@xmath6 in good agreement with this result .",
    "the agreement of halo masses based on galaxy lfs and prior estimates based on clustering etc at higher redshifts , in the context of lbgs , is discussed in cooray ( 2005b ) .",
    "while certain parameters related to the satellite clf are constrained well by current clustering data at low redshifts , parameters related to satellite galaxy types are not . the measurements by zehavi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) involve clustering of galaxies in the same luminosity bin , as well as the clustering of galaxies in the same luminosity bin and the same type ( except in figure  7 , the cross - clustering between early- and late - type galaxies for @xmath261 ) . these measurements ,",
    "while useful , do not provide all the information related to clustering for the same sample of galaxies . for example , to probe the clf of satellites better one can consider cross - correlating galaxies that do not have a significant overlap in halo mass in terms of the central galaxy clf .",
    "the possibility exists when considering a faint and a bright subsample of galaxies . as shown in fig .  5 , the central galaxy clf for galaxies with @xmath262 peaks at a halo mass of few times 10@xmath196 m@xmath6 . the same clf peaks at a halo mass of few times 10@xmath263 m@xmath6 when galaxies with luminosities @xmath264 are considered . while the clf of central galaxies do not overlap , resulting in no contribution to the cross - correlation between these two samples",
    ", there is a certain overlap in the satellite clf and to a lower extent between the central galaxy clf of the brighter sample and the satellite clf of the fainter sample .",
    "the cross - correlation of galaxies between these two luminosity bins will provide an additional handle on the luminosity distribution of satellites in clusters of galaxies .",
    "in fact , one can consider cross - correlations between different luminosity bins as well as different galaxy types ; for example , the cross - correlation between early type galaxies in the fainter sample and late - type galaxies in the brighter sample .",
    "we illustrate the expected cross - correlation between @xmath262 and @xmath264 galaxies in fig .  26 . for reference , in the same plot , we also show the galaxy clustering correlation function of galaxies measured by sdss in each of the two luminosity bins . while the cross - correlation has not been measured in the data yet , we propose these additional measurements for the whole sample",
    ". such measurements , in addition to clustering at each luminosity bin , would provide all the information related to galaxy clustering at the two - point level from any given survey .",
    "this information could in return help further constrain clf of satellite galaxies as well as the fraction of galaxy types in the form of satellites .",
    "while we have concentrated primarily on the use of galaxy lf and clustering measurements to constrain parameters related to central and satellite galaxy clfs here , a primary interest of these statistical measurements is to establish global cosmological parameters .",
    "this has been achieved mostly by combining cmb data , such as from wmap , with large - scale linear clustering with surveys such as sdss ( e.g. , tegmark et al . 2004 ) or with non - linear clustering part modeled based on a simple parameterization of the halo occupation number ( abazajian et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the latter approach can be done with clustering measurements at different redshifts and the combination , as a function of redshift , would provide additional constraints on the growth evolution of density perturbations .",
    "the clf approach suggested here may make this a possibility since clfs provide estimates of galaxy bias , both as a function of luminosity and redshift , once the galaxy sample used for clustering measurements at various redshifts is well defined . while we have not considered cosmological parameters measurements here",
    "this is of significant interest and we hope to return to this once several high - redshift surveys provide more accurate clustering measurements for a well defined sample of galaxies .",
    "to summarize our discussion involving model descriptions of the galaxy lf and clustering statistics with clfs and estimates of clf parameters directly from the data , our main results are :    \\(1 ) instead of the halo occupation number , it may be useful to describe galaxy properties through the clf when describing the galaxy lf and clustering statistics .",
    "as discussed in section  2 , clfs provide a consistent way to compare , and understand , differences in measurements between different samples conditioned in terms of galaxy properties .",
    "while occupation numbers have allowed model fits to clustering statistics , their use is restricted to clustering statistics alone as lfs can not easily be described by occupation statistics that treat all galaxies the same .",
    "\\(2 ) we have outlined a general procedure to describe clfs of central and satellite galaxies by improving prior descriptions of clfs by a priori assumed schechter function shapes ( e.g. , yang et al . 2003b , 2005 ) .",
    "the log - normal distribution for central galaxies and the power - law assumption for satellites combine to produce an overall schechter function shape for galaxy lf ( e.g. , cooray & milosavljevi 2005b ) , but at the same time , also explain why the cluster lf ( e.g. , trentham & tully 2002 ) can not be explained with a single schechter function .",
    "\\(3 ) the combination of sdss lf and clustering data at low redshifts and clustering measurements at high redshifts allow certain model parameters related to central and satellite galaxy clfs be determined from the data .",
    "for example , the appearance of satellites with luminosities @xmath7 at @xmath8 , using a total luminosity  halo mass relation of the form @xmath9 , is constrained with sdss to be at a halo mass of @xmath203 @xmath5 m@xmath6 with a power - law slope @xmath11 of @xmath12 at the 68% confidence level . at @xmath13 , combo-17 data allows these parameters for galaxies with @xmath14 to be constrained as @xmath15 @xmath5 m@xmath6 with a power - law slope of @xmath16 at the 68% confidence level , while at higher redshifts , subaru measurements constrain these parameters for @xmath18 galaxies as @xmath19 @xmath5 m@xmath6 and @xmath20 , respectively at @xmath90 .",
    "deep2 and goods measurements only allow an upper limit on the power - law slope of total luminosity at a given minimum halo mass for the appearance of satellites .",
    "\\(4 ) the single parameter well constrained by clustering measurements is the average of total satellite galaxy luminosity corresponding to the dark matter halo distribution probed by the galaxy sample .",
    "this parameter traces the degeneracy between @xmath85 , the minimum halo mass in which satellites appear , and @xmath11 . for sdss , @xmath21 h@xmath22 l@xmath6 , while for goods at @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 h@xmath22 l@xmath6 .",
    "while current data do not suggest any redshift variation in @xmath227 , consistent with a prior suggestion ( yan et al . 2003 ) that clfs do not evolve in redshift , at the 1@xmath3 confidence level , we note that parameters related to satellite clfs do change between @xmath13 and @xmath90 .",
    "such a difference is expected given the redshift evolution of the halo mass function and the difference in parameters are such that the halo masses where brighter satellites appear at high redshifts host fainter satellites at low redshifts .",

    "<S> the model predictions are compared with the published luminosity function and clustering statistics from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at low redshifts , and galaxy correlation functions from combo-17 survey at a redshift of 0.6 , deep2 survey at a redshift of unity , great observatories deep origins survey ( goods ) at a redshift around 3 , and subaru / xmm - newton deep field data at a redshift of 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with statistical measurements allows us to constrain certain parameters related to analytical descriptions on the relation between a dark matter halo and its central galaxy luminosity , its satellite galaxy luminosity , and the fraction of early- and late - type galaxies of that halo . with the sdss r - band lf at @xmath0 , the log - normal scatter in the central galaxy luminosity at a given halo mass in the central galaxy  halo mass , @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , relation is constrained to be @xmath2 , with 1 @xmath3 errors here and below . </S>",
    "<S> for the same galaxy sample , we find no evidence for a low - mass cut off in the appearance of a single central galaxy in dark matter halos , with the 68% confidence level upper limit on the minimum mass of dark matter halos to host a central galaxy , with luminosity @xmath0 , is @xmath4 @xmath5 m@xmath6 . on the other hand , the appearance of satellites with luminosities @xmath7 at @xmath8 , using a total luminosity - halo mass relation of the form @xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> is constrained with sdss to be at a halo mass of @xmath10 @xmath5 m@xmath6 with a power - law slope @xmath11 of @xmath12 . at @xmath13 , </S>",
    "<S> combo-17 data allows these parameters for @xmath14 galaxies to be constrained as @xmath15 @xmath5 m@xmath6 and @xmath16 , respectively . at @xmath17 , </S>",
    "<S> subaru measurements constrain these parameters for @xmath18 galaxies as @xmath19 @xmath5 m@xmath6 and @xmath20 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift evolution associated with these parameters can be described as a combination of the evolution associated with the halo mass function and the luminosity  halo mass relation . </S>",
    "<S> the single parameter well constrained by clustering measurements is the average of total satellite galaxy luminosity corresponding to the dark matter halo distribution probed by the galaxy sample . for sdss , @xmath21 h@xmath22 l@xmath6 , while for goods at @xmath23 , </S>",

    "<S> in addition to constraints on central and satellite clfs , we also determine model parameters of the analytical relations that describe the fraction of early- and late - type galaxies in dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> we use our clfs to establish probability distribution of halo mass in which galaxies of a given luminosity could be found either at halo centers or as satellites . finally , to help establish further properties of the galaxy distribution , we propose the measurement of cross - clustering between galaxies divided into two distinctly different luminosity bins . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis show how clfs provide a stronger foundation to built up analytical models of the galaxy distribution when compared to models based on the halo occupation number alone .    large scale structure </S>",
