    "a non - hermitian hamiltonian is usually endowed with the physical meaning when it possesses entirely real quantum mechanical energy spectrum and the complex extension of the conventional quantum mechanics , a parity - time ( @xmath1 ) symmetric quantum theory , has been well developed @xcite since the seminal discovery by bender @xcite .",
    "such a theory gives the pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian a physical meaning via its corresponding hermitian counterparts @xcite , which has an identical spectrum . the metric - operator theory outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite provides a mapping of such a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian to an equivalent hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "thus , most of the studies focused on the quasi - hermitian system , or unbroken @xmath1-symmetric region joglekar82,joglekar83 .",
    "however , the obtained equivalent hermitian hamiltonian is usually quite complicated @xcite , involving long - range or nonlocal interactions , which is hardly realized in practice .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath1  symmetry is of great relevance to the technological applications based on the fact that the imaginary potential could be realized by complex index in optics bendix , keya , ydchong , longhilaser .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 optical potentials can be realized through a judicious inclusion of index guiding and gain / loss regions .",
    "such non - hermitian systems are not isolated but usually embedded in the large hermitian waveguides .",
    "pure imaginary potential as a scattering center breaks the conservation of the flow of probability @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to investigate what happens when the non - hermitian system is with balanced gain and loss as a scattering center , and much effort devoted to such a topic is based on the framework of @xmath2-metric @xcite .    in this paper , we study the scattering problem for the non - hermitian scattering center based on the configurations involving two arbitrary hermitian networks coupled with anti - hermitian interaction .",
    "it is shown that for any scattering state of such a non - hermitian system , the dirac probability current is always conserved at any degree of the non - hermiticity .",
    "we apply such a rigorous result to the system with @xmath3-symmetric potentials , which is more feasible in experiment .",

    "in general , a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath4  is related by a similarity transformation to an equivalent hermitian hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "such a connection is valid within the so called unbroken symmetric region .",
    "however , when a non - hermitian system interacts with other hermitian system , such a region loses its physical meaning : on the one hand , the unbroken symmetric region is shifted in the whole non - hermitian system . on the other hand , it may act as a hermitian system in the scattering problem without the restriction on the  degree of the non - hermiticity . in this section , we will investigate the latter situation .",
