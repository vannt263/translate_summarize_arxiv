    "the discovery of quasicrystals @xcite , ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) has stimulated much study of systems with deterministic disorder @xcite .",
    "these systems are neither random nor periodic . as part of this work",

    "the spectral properties are unknown @xcite .",
    "potential distributions corresponding to circle sequences @xcite and the prime number distribution @xcite have also been studied .",
    "transmission properties of 1-d structures for which the potential distributions are initial segments of substitution sequences have also been studied @xcite .",
    "of special interest here are studies of the landauer resistance @xcite for various potential distributions and its relation to the band structure of infinite periodic systems whose unit cells are initial segments of substitution sequences @xcite .",
    "one dimensional structures of these types also appear in a generalization of quantum turing machines introduced elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the generalization consists of modifying the hamiltonian description of quantum turing machines ( qtms ) so that potentials are associated with some types of steps or transitions of the computation as it moves along paths of states in a suitable basis .",
    "the resulting distributions of potentials along these computation paths are computable and are thus either periodic or deterministically disordered . as a result",
    "generalized quantum turing machines ( gqtms ) are both quantum computers and 1-d structures of the type of much recent interest .",
    "the presence of these potentials means that gqtms also serve as a test bed to examine the effect of these potentials on the transmission and reflection of the computation state along any computation path and the completion probability for the computation .",
    "the importance of this for quantum computation has been repeatedly emphasized by landauer @xcite .",
    "he has noted that these potentials , which may result from environmental influences and errors in construction of actual physical models of the computation process @xcite , cause reflections back along the computation path and may result in exponential decay or localization of the transmitted state .",
    "this emphasis is based on the fact that in much of the work done so far on quantum computation , the computation as been assumed to proceed smoothly along computation paths with no potentials present .",
    "this is the case whether quantum computers are used as computers @xcite or as simulators of other quantum systems @xcite .",
    "work on shor s quantum algorithm @xcite and on quantum gates and quantum error correction @xcite is also included .",
    "the main purpose of this work is the examination of the effect of potentials on the spectral and transmission properties of computation states along computation paths .",
    "the method will be based on other work @xcite in which potentials are associated with some types of steps or transitions of the computation as it evolves along paths of states in a suitable basis .",
    "the feynman hamiltonians for these gqtms can , under certain conditions , be decomposed into a direct sum of tight binding hamiltonians , @xmath1 , where the @xmath2 sum is over computation paths of states in a basis .",
    "the potential distribution , @xmath3 , in @xmath4 depends on the path @xmath2 .    here",
    "the example gqtm , which was introduced in other work @xcite , will be examined in detail .",
    "this example , the counting gqtm , which enumerates the integers in succession as binary strings , has a potential associated with read-1 steps only .",
    "( read-1 steps are defined at the end of section [ tbh ] . ) for many paths the potential distribution was seen to be quasicrystalline and to correspond to initial segments of a substitution sequence generated from an infinite alphabet .",
    "both the spectral and transmission properties of the tight binding hamiltonians associated with the counting gqtm will be determined .",
    "the energy band spectra will be calculated for associated periodic systems .",
    "these are 1-d crystals whose unit cells are ( finite sections of ) computation paths that contain the potential distributions being studied .",
    "transmission properties will be calculated by determining the landauer resistance of computation paths for the counting gqtm .",
    "this paper should be read in conjunction with @xcite as much of the earlier work will not be repeated .    in the next section the physical model for qtms ( generalized or not ) will be presented .",
    "this will be followed in section [ tbh ] by a brief description of the generalization of qtms and the decomposition of hamiltonians for gqtms into a sum over paths of tight binding hamiltonians .",
    "computation paths will be defined .",
    "the counting gqtm will be described in section [ cgqtm ] .",
    "the discussion of the step operator and potential distribution will be brief as much of the material is already given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix will be defined for potential distributions containing the first @xmath5 potentials with @xmath6 an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "the emphasis of sections [ sp ] and [ lr ] is on the spectral gaps and band widths for the associated periodic systems and landauer resistance of systems described by tight binding hamiltonians with @xmath7 potentials for the counting gqtm .",
    "the width and separation of the potentials is related to an initial segment of a generalized substitution sequence described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the work is exploratory with emphasis on calculations to show the dependence of these properties on various parameters .",
    "also as was done by roy and khan @xcite , the relation between the landauer resistance of a system and the band spectra of the associated periodic system will be investigated .",
    "it should be noted that the only effect of this generalization is the introduction of potentials along computation paths .",
    "there is no change in the class of qtms or in the concept of quantum computability .",
    "the physical model for one - tape quantum turing machines consists of a two - way infinite one dimensional lattice of systems each of which can assume states in a finite dimensional hilbert space .",

    "this term will be used here even if the dimensionality is greater than two .",
    "it is often convenient but not necessary to consider the lattice as spin systems , e.g. spin 1/2 systems for binary qubits .    a head which can assume any one of a finite number of orthogonal states @xmath8 with @xmath9 moves along the lattice interacting with qubits at or next to its location on the lattice .",
    "elementary qtm actions include one or more of ( 1 ) head motion one lattice site to the right or left , ( 2 ) change of the state of the qubit scanned or read by the head , ( 3 ) change of the head state .",

    "landauer @xcite has emphasized that reflection from background potentials associated with each step of a quantum computation degrade the computation due to multiple reflections from and transmissions through the potentials . in particular for energies below the potential height the transmission",

    "calculations for @xmath264 larger by another factor of @xmath217 to @xmath301 ( @xmath271 ) are shown in figure 12 for @xmath274 .",
    "the extreme violence of fluctuations in the values of @xmath282 , even for the relatively low value of @xmath274 is evident .",
    "this is to be expected since higher values of @xmath264 corresponds to higher values of the potential ( with @xmath17 and @xmath220 fixed ) .",

    "to summarize , the main characteristics of the band spectra shown here include the relative uniformity of band widths compared to gap widths over the bound state momentum regions .",
    "this is especially apparent in figure 3 .",
    "this figure and figure 4 suggest that fluctuations in bands widths do appear to increase somewhat as @xmath264 increases .",

    "most of the @xmath171 region is occupied by bands . for @xmath299 a large fraction",
    "is taken up by gaps and for @xmath305 almost all the region is gaps with a few very narrow bands present .",
    "figures 3 - 5 show that for fixed values of @xmath81 as @xmath6 is increased , energy bands are split into increasing numbers of bands with decreasing widths .",
    "gaps that exist for a given value of @xmath6 appear to be preserved as @xmath6 is increased above the given value .",

    "the figures show that in almost all cases the depth of the minimum in @xmath282 is very dependent on the width of the associated gap .",
    "if the gap is narrow , the minimum is deep . as the gap becomes wider the associated minimum becomes shallower until it disappears for sufficiently wide gaps .",
    "an example of this where the minima has almost disappeared is the gap just below @xmath312 in fig 10 .",
