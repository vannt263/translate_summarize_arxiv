    "globular clusters are an excellent probe to investigate the halos in nearby galaxies .",
    "color distributions of globular clusters in early - type galaxies ( etgs ) , including elliptical and lenticular galaxies , show that there are two subpopulations : blue ( metal - poor ) and red ( metal - rich ) globular clusters @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite investigated the spatial distribution of these subpopulations in 23 virgo etgs using a homogeneous data set based on the acsvcs catalog , which was derived from the observations with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "they found that the ellipticity of the red globular cluster systems ( gcss ) follows much more tightly than that of the stellar light , compared with the ellipticity of the blue gcss . from this and other related properties of the gcss they suggested that massive etgs may have dual halos : a blue ( metal - poor ) halo and a red ( metal - rich ) halo .",
    "the red halos are much more elongated and centrally concentrated than the blue halos .",
    "the red halos may have stronger rotation than the blue halos .",
    "they predicted that etgs may host stellar halos corresponding to these two halos .",
    "however , the number density of the blue halo stars in etgs is much lower than that of the red halo stars in the outer region of their host galaxies so that it is not easy to see the blue halo stars in typical images of etgs .",
    "typical images of etgs show only the structure of the red halos that dominate the integrated light .",
    "indeed the existence of blue ( metal - poor ) rgb stars in etgs was studied for a few nearby galaxies : ngc 3115 ( s0 ) , ngc 5128 ( ep ) , ngc 3377 ( e5 ) , and m105 ( ngc 3379 , e1 ) @xcite . in her pioneering study of stars in an @xmath8/wfpc2 field @xmath9 ( 22 kpc ) away from the major axis of ngc 3115 , an edge - on bright s0 galaxy , @xcite found that the @xmath10 color distribution of the resolved red giants in this field shows a clear bimodality .",
    "then she pointed out that there are two distinct halo populations of roughly equal size : a metal - poor halo with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 and a metal - rich one with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 .",
    "this bimodality was confirmed later in a recent study of the resolved stars in the more remote fields of this galaxy based on deeper photometry by @xcite .",

    "the errorbars in the residual mdfs represent poisson errors of the original mdfs .",
    "it has been generally assumed in the chemical evolution models that the yield ( @xmath188 ) does not vary depending on metallicity .",
    "if the yield is a function of metallicity , a single - component accreting gas model would fit the data even for the low metallicity range . however , there are no physical justifications for this and nothing is known about how it varies as a function of metallicity .",
    "third , interestingly the residual mdfs show clearly an excess in the low metallicity range at [ m / h]@xmath253 in both the inner and outer regions .",
    "the excess in the narrow high metallicity range at [ m / h]@xmath254 for the inner region is dominated by the errors , as shown by the errorbars , and also by the larger uncertainty in the metallicity estimation so that it can be ignored .",
    "we fit the residual mdfs for [ m / h]@xmath253 with single component models , finding that all three models fit reasonably well the residual mdfs .",
    "it is noted also that the shapes of the residual mdfs in both regions appear to be similar to those for the bright dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "fourth , in the accreting gas models with double components , the metal yield parameter for the metal - rich component ( @xmath255 ) in the inner region is about one order of magnitude larger than that for the metal - poor component ( @xmath256 ) , while the final mass parameter for the metal - rich component ( @xmath257 ) for the inner region is about twice larger than that for the metal - poor component ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "similar trends are also seen in the outer region : @xmath259 and @xmath260 for the metal - rich component , and @xmath261 and @xmath262 for the metal - poor component .",

    "then we derived the metallicity of the resolved stars using the same procedures as done for m105 . in * figure [ fig_cmdcomp ]",
    "* all galaxies show prominent rgbs .",
    "however , the width of the rgb gets narrower and the mean color of the rgb gets bluer , as their host galaxies become fainter .        in * figure [ fig_mdfcomp ] * we compare the mdfs for the bright rgb stars in the inner and outer regions of m105 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and those in other galaxies and the virgo core field .",
    "several distinguishable features are found in this figure .",
    "first , the mdf of the outer region in m105 is remarkably similar to that of the intracluster field in the virgo .",
    "both mdfs show two major components and their peak positions are similar ( [ m / h ] @xmath298 and 0.1 , respectively ) .",
    "this shows that the outer field of massive galaxies and intracluster field close to the center of galaxy clusters may share a similar history of growing .",
    "the existence of the significant metal - rich component with [ m / h ] @xmath296 in both the outer halo of m105 and the virgo core field implies that a significant fraction of the progenitors for the stars in these low density regions are massive galaxies ( as massive as m105 ) .",
    "second , the peak metallicity of the high metallicity component in each galaxy is higher for brighter galaxies , consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "third , the peak metallicity of the metal - poor component in m105 ( as well as in the virgo core field ) is similar to that of ngc 5011c ( @xmath318 mag ) .",
    "this implies that the progenitors of these metal - poor components are probably dwarf galaxies with @xmath319 to 15 mag .",
    "fourth , the progenitors of the metal - poor stars at the very low metallicity tail ( [ m / h]@xmath320 ) in m105 are , in part , fainter dwarf galaxies with @xmath321 mag ( dsphs and ufds ) . some of them may have come from the early stages of star formation in the central galaxy .",
    "key results found in this study are 1 ) that the mdf of the bright rgb stars in the large range of galactocentric distance of m105 is bimodal , 2 ) that the metal - poor component is getting more dominant in the outer region of a galaxy , 3 ) that the radial number density profiles of the metal - rich and metal - poor stars in m105 are significantly different in the outer region , 4 ) that the radial number density profiles of the metal - rich and metal - poor stars in m105 are fitted well by the sersic law with @xmath322 and @xmath323 , respectively , 5 ) that the peak metallicity of the metal - rich component in the outer halo of m105 is similar to that of the virgo core field , 6 ) that the peak metallicity of the metal - poor component in m105 ( as well as in the virgo core field ) is similar to that of ngc 5011c ( @xmath318 mag ) , and 7 ) that the progenitors of the metal - poor stars at the low metallicity tail ( [ m / h ] @xmath320 ) in m105 are possibly fainter dwarf galaxies with @xmath321 mag ( dsphs and ufds ) .",
    "these results indicate that there are two distinct stellar halos in massive etgs like m105 : a metal - poor ( blue ) halo and a metal - rich ( red ) halo .",
    "the metal - rich halo is dominant in the inner region , while the metal - poor halo is more distinguishable in the outer region .",
    "@xcite found the existence of a distinguishable blue rgb in the study of the same outer field as used in this study , and predicted that \" large e / s0 galaxies in general will have diffuse , very low - metallicity halo components , but that photometry at radii ( @xmath324 ) will be necessary to find them  .",
    "since then these diffuse low - metallicity halo components have been found in the outer regions of a few e / s0 galaxies .",
    "the existence of dual stellar halos in massive etgs is consistent with the prediction based on the globular cluster systems in etgs @xcite : massive etgs may have often dual halos , one blue ( metal - poor ) halo and one red ( metal - rich ) halo . considering the properties of red and blue globular cluster systems in massive etgs , @xcite suggested a dual halo scenario for how massive etgs formed .",
    "massive etgs are formed in two main modes : a metal - rich halo mode and a metal - poor halo mode .",
    "we provide an updated scenario , including the information we found from the stellar halos in this study .",
    "* figure [ fig_scenario ] * illustrates a schematic view of the main features of this scenario .",
    "this scenario is based on the concept of hierarchical merging models for structure formation ( @xcite and references therein ) , focusing on the observational results on the properties of the resolved stars and globular clusters in etgs .",
    "all galaxies should have different formation histories , because they start with progenitors with different masses and are involved with diverse histories of merging .",
    "however , considering the bimodality of the mdfs of the resolved stars in etgs , we can divide the formation modes roughly into two : a metal - rich halo mode and a metal - poor mode .    in the metal - rich halo mode , metal - rich halos formed in two phases . in the first phase , during the early phase of the universe , progenitors of today s massive galaxies formed via rapid collapse of massive protogalactic clouds ( in situ formation of stars ) @xcite and/or major mergers , while a much larger number of low mass galaxies and globular clusters formed via collapse of low mass clouds embedded in low mass dark matter halos mostly around the massive galaxies @xcite . these two processes",
    "( in situ collapse and major mergers ) in the massive progenitors are not independent , but both can happen in the same galaxy with a small time lag .",
    "major mergers can be either wet or dry and they can be involved also with several mergers . in this mode , the mdf of the stars in the massive galaxies will show a dominant metal - rich component with a weak tail in the low metallicity end , as described in classical chemical evolution models .",
    "the larger the masses of the most massive progenitors are , the higher the peak values of the stellar metallicity are .",
    "the structure , color , and luminosity of the resulting galaxies are dominated by the metal - rich stars . in the second phase ,",
    "the metal - rich halos grow mostly via merging with intermediate mass galaxies that have metallicities higher than those of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the mdfs in the resulting galaxies will be broader toward the low metallicity .",
    "they will be involved with numerous merging with low - mass / dwarf galaxies as well , but it will contribute only a minor role in increasing the mass and size of the metal - rich halos .",
    "thus the metal - rich halos formed and evolve in two phases , being dominated by metal - rich stars .    in the metal - poor halo mode , metal - poor halos",
    "grow mainly via accretion or minor mergers of dwarf galaxies for long duration .",
    "the outstanding existence of a distinct blue ( metal - poor ) rgb in the outer region of massive galaxies shows that they are not the low metallicity tail of the main population ( the metal - rich halo ) , but they have a distinct origin .",
    "the origin of the metal - poor stars is considered to be accreted dwarf galaxies that have mainly low metallicity stars with [ m / h]@xmath213 .",
    "some brighter dwarf galaxies like ngc 5011c ( @xmath325 mag ) produce the metal - poor component peak at [ m / h]@xmath326 . among the dwarf galaxies , ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) are one of the strong candidates for the low metallicity tail at [ m / h]@xmath320 .",
    "ufds have been found mostly in the local group @xcite .",
    "the stellar populations in several nearby ufds in the local group @xcite and the virgo cluster @xcite are known to be old and metal - poor , consistent with the halo stars in the low metallicity tail in m105 .",
    "these dwarfs are accreted in the outer region of a galaxy , contributing to the growth of the metal - poor halo .",
    "thus the accreted stars in the metal - poor halo must be very old , although they join the metal - poor halo during the long period .",
    "the number density of the metal - poor stars is very low so that they make only a minor contribution to the luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "however , they contain critical clues to understand how and when the outer halo formed and to study the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "this dual halo mode scenario , mainly based on observational results of resolved red giants and globular clusters in nearby galaxies , is consistent with the two - phase scenario derived from high - resolution cosmological simulations ( @xcite and references therein ) . in the first phase of this scenario , compact cores of massive galaxies form rapidly via in - situ star formation associated with cold flows and/or gaseous mergers early at @xmath327 .",
    "these compact massive galaxies will have , on average , @xmath328 , @xmath329 kpc , and @xmath330 km s@xmath18 , around the end of this phase , and they will show disk - like structures flatter than today s etgs . then in the second phase , these compact massive galaxies get bigger mainly via minor dry merging .",
    "the effective radii of these galaxies grow significantly faster in size than in mass as a result of conservation of angular momentum , and they will have lower velocity dispersion in the central region . as time goes on , these galaxies will have larger outer envelopes , which also grow in mass , occupying a major fraction of mass in more massive galaxies",
    ". however , note that there are other views in the literature .",
    "for example , noting the abundance of compact massive bulges in nearby disk galaxies , @xcite concluded that not all compact massive galaxies at high redshift grow dramatically in size .",
    "instead some of them keep their compactness , being embedded in disks that grow slowly for long .",
    "this scenario has been successful in explaining several observational results on the integrated properties of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the results on the resolved stars in m105 and other etgs in this study provide another strong constraint to test the formation scenarios based on cosmological simulations .",
    "in particular the bimodal mdfs of the resolved stars in etgs including these galaxies need to be considered in the future simulations .",
    "using deep photometry of the resolved stars in the large range of galactocentric distance ( @xmath331 ) of m105 , a standard elliptical galaxy , we provided strong evidence that there are two subpopulations of rgb stars in this galaxy and investigated their structure and mdfs .",
    "we also presented the mdfs of the bright rgb stars in other nearby etgs with a range of luminosity as well as in the virgo core field derived using the same procedures as used for m105 .",
    "then we described the mdfs of m105 using the chemical evolution models , and discussed the implications of the results in terms of the dual halo mode formation scenario to explain how massive etgs formed .",
    "primary results are summarized as follows .    *",
    "the resolved stars in m105 are mostly rgb stars .",
    "we measured the trgb magnitudes using an edge - detection method for the inner and outer region , obtaining @xmath332 . from the mean of the inner and outer regions ,",
    "we obtain a distance modulus @xmath333 .",
    "this confirms that m105 is a member of the leo i group .",
    "* the bright rgb stars in the cmds and their color distributions show the existence of two distinct subpopulations : a strong red rgb with a broad color range and a weaker blue rgb with a narrower color range .",
    "* we derived metallicities of the bright rgb stars from the comparison of their photometry with theoretical isochrones for 12 gyr age .",
    "the mdf of the rgb stars in m105 also shows the existence of two distinct subpopulations : a dominant metal - rich population ( with a peak at [ m / h]@xmath334 ) and a much weaker metal - poor population ( with a peak at [ m / h]@xmath335 ) .",
    "* we divided the bright rgb stars into two groups according to their metallicity : a metal - poor one ( @xmath161[m / h]@xmath252 ) and a metal - rich one ( @xmath336[m / h]@xmath337 ) .",
    "the radial number density profile of the metal - rich rgb stars is significantly steeper than that of the metal - poor rgb stars in the outer region , while the slopes of both are similar in the inner region .",
    "the number density of the metal - rich stars is much higher than that of the metal - poor stars in the inner region at @xmath338 , but becomes lower thereafter .",
    "the radial number density profiles of the metal - rich and metal - poor rgb stars in the entire range of galactocentric distance are fit well by a srsic law with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "they are also fit by a single power law : @xmath339 for the metal - rich stars and @xmath340 for the metal - poor stars . *",
    "the mdfs of both the inner region and the outer region can be described remarkably well by accreting gas models of chemical evolution with two components , a metal - rich one and a metal - poor one .",
    "the peak metallicity of the metal  rich component in the inner region is only 0.1 dex higher than that for the outer region .",
    "the metal - poor components also show a similar trend .",
    "the radial gradient of the metallicity between the two regions is dominated by the population mixture , rather than by the continuous change of the peak metallicity . *",
    "these results provide strong evidence that there are two types of stellar halos in m105 : a metal - poor ( blue ) and a metal - rich ( red ) halo .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction in the dual halo scenario based on the spatial distribution of the globular clusters in bright etgs by @xcite . * comparing the mdfs of the resolved stars in m105 with those of the resolved stars in faint to bright etgs and in the intracluster field of the virgo core",
