    "the form of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is of fundamental importance for many areas of astrophysics and a topic of considerable debate ( see , e.g. , schmidt 1959 ; miller & scalo 1979 ; scalo 1986 ; larson 1998 , 2003 ; kroupa 2002 ; chabrier 2003 , for reviews ) . measurements of the imf are difficult and somewhat model - dependent as they require the conversion of the observed present - day luminosity function of a stellar population to its mass function at birth .",
    "best estimates for the galactic disk suggest that the imf has a powerlaw slope at @xmath15 , and turns over at lower masses ( kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "this turnover can be modeled by a broken powerlaw ( kroupa 2001 ) or by a log - normal distribution with a characteristic mass @xmath6 ( chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is @xmath16 in the disk of the milky way , with considerable uncertainty .",
    "the powerlaw slope at high masses is probably close to the salpeter ( 1955 ) value of @xmath17 , with an uncertainty of @xmath18 ( scalo 1986 ; chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "although there is no direct evidence for dramatic variations of the imf within the present - day milky way disk ( e.g. , kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ) , this does not preclude variations with time , metallicity , and/or environment .",
    "in particular , larson ( 1998 , 2005 ) has argued that the characteristic turnover mass may be largely determined by the thermal jeans mass , which strongly depends on temperature ( @xmath19 at fixed density ) . in the context of this model",
    "one might expect that heating by ambient far - infrared radiation would disfavor the formation of low mass stars in extreme environments , such as in super star clusters and in the center of the milky way .",
    "other models emphasize the role of turbulence as opposed to temperature in determining the distribution of protostellar clumps ( e.g. , padoan & nordlund 2002 ) , and in these models the role of the environment may be less direct ( see mckee & ostriker [ 2007 ] for a recent review of various models to explain the characteristics of the imf ) .",
    "observations may support the notion of a top - heavy ( or `` bottom - light '' ) imf in extreme environments .",
    "some young super star clusters in m82 appear to have a top - heavy mass function ( e.g. , rieke et  al .",
    "1993 ; mccrady , gilbert , & graham 2003 ) , as do clusters in the galactic center region ( e.g. , figer et  al .",
    "1999 ; stolte et  al . 2005",
    "; maness et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "the interpretation of observed mass functions is complicated by dynamical effects , which tend to make the mass function more top - heavy over time , in particular in the central regions of star clusters ( see , e.g. , mccrady et  al .",
    "2003 ; mccrady , graham , & vacca 2005 ; kim et  al .",
    "recently harayama , eisenhauer , & martins ( 2007 ) studied the imf of ngc 3603 , one of the most massive galactic star - forming regions , out to large radii and conclude that its imf is substantially flatter than salpeter for masses @xmath20 .",
    "the imf may also depend on redshift . at earlier times star formation presumably occurred more often in a burst mode than in a relatively gradual `` disk '' mode ( e.g. , steidel et  al .",
    "1996 ; blain et  al . 1999b",
    "; lacey et  al . 2007 ) , which means that the imf could generally be more skewed toward high mass stars at redshifts 13 and beyond .",
    "furthermore , the average metallicity in star forming clouds was lower at higher redshift , which may have led to an extremely top - heavy imf for the first generation of stars ( e.g. , abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation sets a floor to the ambient temperature , and hence the jeans mass , which scales with @xmath21 . beyond @xmath22",
    "the cmb temperature exceeds the typical temperatures of dense prestellar cores in galactic molecular clouds ( e.g. evans et  al . 2001 ; tafalla et  al .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high redshift the characteristic mass may be expected to evolve roughly as @xmath23 , leading to imfs which have a reduced fraction of low mass stars ( larson 1998 ) .",
    "the effects of the cmb are even more pronounced when its influence on the pressure in star - forming clouds is taken into account , and larson ( 2005 ) suggests that at @xmath24 the characteristic mass may be higher than today s value by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "such rapid evolution of the imf would have important consequences for determinations of masses and star formation rates of distant galaxies , and for measurements of evolution in these properties .",
    "it is very difficult to constrain the imf at early times directly , as the light of high redshift galaxies is completely dominated by massive stars .",
    "the extremely blue rest - frame uv colors of galaxies at @xmath25 may imply a top - heavy imf ( stanway , mcmahon , & bunker 2005 ) , although this is just one of several possible explanations . from observations of a lensed lyman break galaxy",
    "there is some evidence that the _ slope _ of the imf at @xmath26 is similar to the salpeter value at the high mass end ( pettini et  al .",
    "2000 ) , but there is essentially no information on stars with masses near or below 1 .    fortunately , the form of the high redshift imf has implications for the properties of galaxies at much lower redshift , as all stars with masses @xmath27  that formed in the history of the universe are still with us today .",
    "tumlinson ( 2007 ) finds that the properties of carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars in our galaxy are best explained with a relatively high number of stars in the mass range 18   at high redshift .",
    "various other constraints obtained from galaxies at low redshift ( including our own ) are reviewed in chabrier ( 2003 ) .",
    "of particular interest are the stellar populations of massive early - type galaxies , as they are very homogeneous and should reflect conditions in star forming regions at @xmath28 .",
    "recently , cappellari et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) used the kinematics of elliptical galaxies to constrain the imf , as the dynamical @xmath29 ratio provides an upper limit to the amount of mass that can be locked up in low mass stars .",
    "current data appear to rule out a salpeter ( 1955 ) ( or steeper ) imf , but are consistent with kroupa ( 2001 ) and chabrier ( 2003 ) imfs ( cappellari et  al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we provide new constraints on the imf at high redshift by comparing the _ evolution _ of the @xmath29 ratios of early - type galaxies to their color evolution .",
    "this method was first suggested by tinsley ( 1980 ) , but data of sufficient accuracy are only now becoming available .",
    "the method is sensitive to the imf in the important mass range around 1 , where the effects of an evolving characteristic mass might be expected to manifest themselves .    a plan of the paper follows . in  2 a relation between color evolution , luminosity evolution , and the logarithmic slope of the imf @xmath30",
    "is derived using stellar population synthesis models . in ",
    "3 published data and archival hst images of galaxy clusters are used to construct the redshift evolution of the @xmath1 color - mass relation . in ",
    "4 the color evolution from  3 is combined with the previously measured evolution of the @xmath2 ratio . the relations from  2",
    "are then used to derive constraints on the imf slope @xmath30 from the combined color and luminosity evolution .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the ( many ) systematic uncertainties in the methodology and in the data , and  6 asks whether our results are consistent with other constraints on the stellar populations of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "although the constraints we derive in this paper are subject to many uncertainties , it is interesting to explore their consequences . in  7 the fitting results of  4 are interpreted in the context of an evolving characteristic mass @xmath6 .",
    "the data on cluster galaxies are combined with previous constraints on @xmath6 for globular clusters and submm - galaxies , and a simple form of imf evolution is proposed .",
    "this evolution is then applied to literature data on the evolution of the volume - averaged star formation rate and stellar mass density .",
    "the key results are summarized in  8 .",
    "we assume @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33mpc@xmath34 where needed .",
    "the form of the imf has a strong effect on the evolution of the @xmath29 ratio of galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of a stellar population is expected to evolve even in the absence of star formation or mergers , due to the fact that stars turn off the main sequence and die .",
    "the rate of luminosity evolution in a given passband is determined by a combination of the lifetime of stars near the turn - off and the number of these stars .",
    "the lifetime of turn - off stars is directly determined by the age of the stellar population ( with the lifetime approximately equal to the age ) , and the number of turn - off stars is directly determined by the imf . a flat",
    ", top - heavy imf implies a relatively large number of short - lived massive stars and rapid luminosity evolution , whereas a steep imf implies a relatively large number of long - lived low mass stars and slow evolution .",
    "the color evolution behaves differently , as it is insensitive to the number of stars that evolves off the main sequence over time .",
    "instead it is mainly driven by the location of the turn - off in the herzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , which does not depend on the imf but is determined by the age of the stellar population .",
    "the imf does influence the color evolution to some extent , as a top - heavy imf reduces the number of turn - off stars with respect to the more luminous red giants .",
    "the location of the giant branch evolves much less than the location of the turn - off , and a flat imf therefore implies weaker color evolution than a steep imf . as first pointed out by tinsley ( 1980 ) , the imf thus has opposite effects on the luminosity and color evolution : a more top - heavy imf leads to stronger luminosity evolution and weaker color evolution .",
    "= 17.5 cm      following tinsley ( 1980 ) and many later studies , we parameterize luminosity and color evolution by power laws .",
    "power law approximations render the predicted evolution independent of the hubble constant and the absolute age calibration of the model , and smooth out artifacts in the evolution of single - age stellar populations caused by numerical effects . in our passbands",
    "( see  [ data.sec ] ) luminosity evolution takes the form @xmath35 and color evolution takes the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 the luminosity - weighted mean star formation epoch and @xmath38 and @xmath39 constants .",
    "we use the maraston ( 2005 ) stellar population synthesis models to determine @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "[ mlcol.plot](a ) and ( b ) show the evolution of the @xmath2 ratio and @xmath1 color in this model for three different values of @xmath30 ( 1.3 , 0.7 , 0 ) .",
    "these imfs are power laws with a fixed slope over the mass range @xmath42 .",
    "the predictions are for a metallicity [ z / h]@xmath43 .",
    "this relatively high value may be more appropriate for massive early - type galaxies than the solar value ( e.g. , worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ) , although solar models are much better calibrated . as expected , luminosity evolution has a strong imf dependence but color evolution only has a weak ( and opposite ) imf dependence .",
    "panel ( c ) directly compares the evolution of the @xmath29 ratio to the color evolution .",
    "the imf dependence is relatively strong in this panel , due to the opposite effects of the imf on luminosity and color evolution .",
    "broken lines in panels ( a - c ) are power law fits to the model predictions .",
    "these fits generally provide good descriptions of the behavior of the models .",
    "the largest deviations are for the @xmath1 colors at 9 and 12 gyr , where the fits are off by @xmath44 and @xmath45 mag respectively .",
    "panels ( d - f ) show the relation between the powerlaw coefficients and the imf slope . in each case",

    "[ kappa1.eq ] and [ kappa2.eq ] ; this relation is consistent with eq .",
    "[ kappa3.eq ] to a few percent .",
    "open symbols and dashed lines are predictions for models with [ fe / h]=0 .",
    "luminosity evolution is insensitive to [ fe / h ] , but color evolution has a strong metallicity - dependence .",
    "therefore , the relation in panel ( f ) also has a strong metallicity dependence , and takes the form @xmath49 for solar metallicity . when determining the imf slope in ",
    "[ apply.sec ] results will be given both for super - solar models and solar models ( which are better calibrated ) .",
    "as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ mlcol.plot ] , the imf mostly influences the luminosity evolution , and the color evolution can be viewed as an imf - insensitive `` clock '' constraining the age . by combining color and luminosity evolution for a well - chosen set of galaxies over a sufficiently large redshift range the slope of the imf @xmath30 and the formation time of the stars @xmath37 can , in principle , be constrained simultaneously ( although there are many caveats ",
    "see  5 ) .",
    "the method requires very accurate rest - frame color and @xmath29 measurements for a passively evolving sample of galaxies .",
    "this is not an easy task , as galaxy evolution is in general a complex process involving star bursts , mergers , and morphological changes .",
    "the most massive early - type galaxies in clusters at modest redshifts ( @xmath50 ) come closest to a `` purely passive '' sample .",

    "in this section , data from the literature and the hst archive are used to determine the evolution of rest - frame @xmath1 colors of galaxies in clusters from the vv07 sample .",

    "as discussed in detail in several papers ( e.g. , franx 1993 ; van dokkum & franx 1996 ; treu et  al . 2001 ) the empirical fp relation can be rewritten as a relation between @xmath29 ratio and mass , if it is assumed that @xmath177 ( with @xmath56 the stellar velocity dispersion and @xmath58 the effective radius ) and early - type galaxies are a homologous family . if these assumptions are valid the observed evolution of the fp should track the evolution of the zeropoint of the underlying @xmath29  mass relation . however , this may not be the case if galaxies undergo significant structural changes over time , due to merging or other processes ( see , e.g. , almeida , baugh , & lacey 2007 ) .",
    "strong gravitational lenses provide an independent check on the fp interpretation .",
    "current results indicate that the evolution of the @xmath29 ratio as derived from strong lenses is consistent with that derived for field early - type galaxies ( rusin & kochanek 2005 ) , although the systematic uncertainties in this comparison are still fairly substantial ( see , e.g. , treu & koopmans 2004 ; van der wel et  al .",
    "2005 ; rusin & kochanek 2005 ) .",
    "recently van der marel & van dokkum ( 2007 ) used spatially - resolved photometric and dynamical observations of cluster early - type galaxies at @xmath178 to directly test the assumption that the fp tracks @xmath29 evolution .",
    "@xmath29 ratios derived from modeling the spatially - resolved data were directly compared to those determined from the fp .",
    "interestingly , the validity of the fp for determining @xmath29 ratios appears to depend on the mass : for galaxies with masses @xmath179  or velocity dispersions @xmath180the @xmath29 ratios are consistent with each other , but for low mass galaxies the fp appears to systematically underestimate the @xmath29 ratio .",
    "although these results suggest that the traditional interpretation of fp evolution is substantially correct at the high mass end , further tests would be valuable , particularly at @xmath181 .",
    "another complication is that the measured @xmath29 ratio is not identical to the stellar @xmath29 ratio calculated in stellar population synthesis models . in the models @xmath182 is the sum of the mass of all living stars and the mass of stellar remnants ( black holes , neutron stars , and white dwarfs ) .",
    "by contrast , the measured mass includes all possible contributions , including dark matter and gas .",
    "although the amount of dark matter in elliptical galaxies is still somewhat uncertain ( e.g. , romanowsky et  al . 2003 ; mamon & okas 2005 ; cappellari et  al .",
    "2006 ) , its contribution within the effective radius is probably small ( mamon & okas 2005 ; koopmans et  al .",
    "the contribution of gas to the total mass is also uncertain .",
    "one would expect substantial amounts of gas and dust from stellar mass loss ( see , e.g. , goudfrooij et  al .",
    "1994 ) , qualitatively consistent with spitzer observations ( temi , brighenti , & mathews 2007 ) .",
    "however , the data appear to be inconsistent with simple expectations , and temi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that the gas is transported outward , possibly due to agn activity .",
    "furthermore , in galaxy clusters the galaxies move through very hot , diffuse gas at great speed and it seems likely that any cold gas coming from stellar winds is fairly efficiently stripped or heated .",
    "although dark matter and gas could contribute to the measured @xmath29 ratio , these contributions will to large extent cancel when comparing galaxies over a range of redshifts . in the maraston ( 2005 )",
    "models the amount of mass loss over the relevant age range from 5gyr to 12gyr is only @xmath183% for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf and @xmath184% for a kroupa ( 2001 ) imf . even if half of this mass was retained rather than lost to the intracluster medium , the @xmath29 evolution would change by only @xmath185% .",
    "uncertainties in the stellar population synthesis models are perhaps the largest source of error , and at the same time they are notoriously difficult to quantify .",
    "the fundamental problem is that the main direct tests and calibrations of the models are offered by galactic open clusters and globular clusters , but that these may not be representative for the integrated stellar populations of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "recently the confidence in these models was somewhat shaken by the large differences that exist between predictions of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and maraston ( 2005 ) . as discussed in detail by maraston ( 2005 ) and others ( e.g. , van der wel et  al .",

    "our analysis avoids the region of parameters space where the differences between the models are most pronounced ( ages of 0.52gyr and rest - frame near - infrared passbands ) .",

    "the effect of a bs population such as that in m67 would be larger than the imf effects discussed in this paper , and there is no a priori reason to suppose that bss do not exist in elliptical galaxies ( see , e.g. , stryker 1993 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they probably do not have a very large effect on our results .",
    "first , the relevant question is not how much bss contribute to the integrated colors , but to what extent they influence their _ evolution _ from @xmath199gyr ( the age at @xmath200 for @xmath201 ) to @xmath202gyr ( the age at @xmath194 ) . to have a significant impact on our results",
    "bss would have to have been absent in elliptical galaxies for five or more gyr and then have `` turned on '' .",

    "1990 ) , and if binaries start out with a flat distribution of orbital parameters the rate at which some of them turn into bss will gradually decrease . coupled with the fact that bs lifetimes are short compared to the main sequence stars , this could lead to a gradual decline in the blue straggler population .",
    "more to the point , xin & deng ( 2005 ) have determined the contribution of bss to the integrated light of open clusters with a large range of ages .",
    "they find no correlation between the contribution of bss to the integrated colors and the age of the cluster . as a result",
    ", the integrated colors of clusters with ages varying from 1gyr to 8gyr are reasonably well described by a single stellar population synthesis model with a constant offset .",
    "another reason why the effects of bss are probably fairly mild is that it is difficult to hide them completely in nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "if bss are as prevalent in elliptical galaxies as they are in open clusters , they would lead to relatively blue near - uv colors and strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "population synthesis models would ( correctly ) infer the presence of a and f main sequence stars , and ( incorrectly ) attribute them to a secondary young stellar population , and/or assign an overall young luminosity - weighted age to the galaxy . as pointed out by schiavon , caldwell , & rose ( 2004 ) , if a galaxy had the same stellar population as m67 it would be classified as `` e+a '' ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) to signify the presence of a post - starburst component in addition to an older component .",
    "xin & deng ( 2005 ) quantify these effects and conclude that the ages of unresolved stellar populations will typically be underestimated by a factor of @xmath7 if blue stragglers are present in similar numbers as in open clusters . turning to many years of population synthesis modeling of massive elliptical galaxies in clusters ,",

    "the broken lines in fig .  [ larson.plot ] are examples of models in which the temperature of the cmb effectively sets the characteristic mass scale of star formation at high redshift ( see larson 1998 , 2005 ; jappsen et  al .",

    "the normalization of these models is also very uncertain .",
    "the value of @xmath18  is the approximate value of the jeans mass in present - day cores ( larson 2005 ) , but other aspects may play a role in setting the characteristic mass at low redshift ( see mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "the grey solid line is a non - physical `` toy model '' which fits the milky way disk , submm - galaxies , and cluster galaxies and is intermediate between the two physically - motivated models at high redshift .",
    "this model has the form @xmath275 and is used to explore the effects of an evolving characteristic mass in the following sections .",
    "it is interesting that the imf of old globular clusters appears to have a lower characteristic mass than the imf of massive cluster galaxies , even though their stars probably have similar mean ages .",
    "determining the imf in globular clusters is notoriously difficult , as the mass function as observed today is heavily influenced by dynamical effects in combination with stellar evolution ( see , e.g. , chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , globular clusters with a very top - heavy imf would not be expected to survive in the tidal field of our galaxy for a hubble time ( e.g. , joshi , nave , & rasio 2001 ) , and the clusters that are surviving today might not be representative for the original population .",
    "nevertheless , taking the existing constraints at face value , it seems that other parameters than the cmb temperature ( e.g. , metallicity , star formation rate , or mass of the star forming complex ) may play a role in determining @xmath6 at high redshift .      as pointed out by others ( e.g. , larson 2005 ; hopkins & beacom 2006 ; tumlinson 2007 ; fardal et  al .",
    "2007 ) , an evolving imf has direct implications for the derived cosmic star formation history .",
    "essentially all indicators of the star formation rate ( such as ultraviolet luminosity , h@xmath112 line luminosity , and infrared luminosity ) measure the effects of luminous o and b stars , which have masses @xmath276 .",
    "inferred total star formation rates therefore rely on an extrapolation of the imf from @xmath277  down to @xmath16(see , e.g. , lilly et  al .",
    "1996 ; madau et  al . 1996",
    "; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) . as most of the total mass is in low mass stars ,",
    "changes to the imf in the mass range 0.11will have virtually no effect on the observed star formation indicators but potentially large effects on the actual total stellar mass that is produced .",

    "the effects are substantial at high redshift , and at @xmath25 the star formation rate could be overestimated by a factor of 34 relative to @xmath194 .    in fig .",
    "[ madau.plot](b ) the correction of panel ( a ) is applied to measurements of the star formation rate at a range of redshifts .",

    "black points are the same data , corrected to the modified chabrier ( 2003 ) imf proposed in this paper .",
    "this correction is a combination of two effects : a constant offset to account for the difference between a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ( which is assumed in the quoted literature ) and a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , and the redshift - dependent effect shown in fig .",
    "[ madau.plot](a ) . as is clear from the black line , the cosmic star formation history has a fairly well - defined peak at @xmath12 if the imf depends on redshift .",
    "the influence of an evolving imf on the @xmath29 ratios of galaxies is complex , as several competing effects play a role .",
    "the number of low mass stars with respect to high mass stars is reduced , which lowers the @xmath29 ratio as these stars contribute little to the integrated light .",
    "however , for @xmath279  the number of turn - off stars is also reduced ( see fig .",

    "the net effect of an increased @xmath6 on the @xmath29 ratio is generally smaller than on the star formation rate .",
    "a further complication is that the turn - off mass can be similar to the characteristic mass ( e.g. , in elliptical galaxies at low redshift where both values are @xmath208 ) .",
    "this means that the effect on the @xmath29 ratio is not a constant , but depends on the age of the population .",

    "a correct treatment of these issues requires full stellar population synthesis modeling , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "instead , we used simple stellar evolutionary tracks to estimate what the net outcome is of the various competing mechanisms .",

    "monte - carlo simulations of 100,000 stars were generated , with solar metallicity , a range of ages , and a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",

    "remnant - dominated , with @xmath280% of the mass in remnants for an age of 10gyr and @xmath281 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath13 ratios are actually _ higher _ than for a standard chabrier ( 2003 ) imf wih @xmath254 , approaching or even exceeding those implied by a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "although these results are somewhat uncertain due to the crude nature of our modeling , the qualitative conclusion is that the @xmath13 ratios of galaxies are not necessarily strongly reduced by an evolving imf , in contrast to their star formation rates .      in fig .",
    "[ mdens.plot ] we show the effects of an evolving imf on the cosmic stellar mass density , in a similar way as was done in fig.[madau.plot ] for the cosmic star formation history .",

    "2007 ) , the fact that the two independent measures of the build - up of stellar mass in the universe agree to within a factor of @xmath7 can be considered a success . in any case , the discrepancy is smaller for the evolving imf than for a non - evolving imf , because the star formation rate is reduced by a larger fraction than the mass density .",

    "the commonly used bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and maraston ( 2005 ) models give broadly similar answers , but that may be because they share many of the same assumptions .    as discussed in  [ comp.sec ] the higher stellar ages implied by a flat imf are consistent with many other studies , which lends some credibility to the results presented here . of particular importance is the agreement with the data on balmer line strengths of kelson et  al .",

    "the analysis presented here can be improved in various ways .",

    ", it would be helpful to implement more variations of the imf in stellar population synthesis codes than the standard salpeter , kroupa , and chabrier forms",

    "<S> such a `` bottom - light '' imf for massive cluster galaxies has significant implications for the interpretation of measurements of galaxy formation and evolution . applying a simple form of imf evolution to literature data </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the volume - averaged star formation rate at high redshift may have been overestimated ( by a factor of @xmath10 at @xmath11 ) , and the cosmic star formation history may have a fairly well - defined peak at @xmath12 . the @xmath13 ratios of galaxies are less affected than their star formation rates , and future data on the stellar mass density at @xmath14 will provide further constraints on imf evolution . </S>",
