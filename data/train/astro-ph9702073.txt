    "cygnus  x1 is one of the best studied x  ray sources .",
    "it was discovered in 1965 ( @xcite ) , and its binary nature was soon established with the detection of an orbital period of 5.6 days ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the optical radial ",
    "velocity measurements indicate that the compact object has a mass in excess of @xmath1 and a probable mass of @xmath2 ( gies & bolton 1982 , 1986 ) , strongly suggesting that there is a black hole in the system .",
    "cyg  x1 belongs to the class of high  mass x",
    " ray binaries .",
    "its companion was identified as a o9.7 iab supergiant with a mass in excess of @xmath3 and a probable mass of @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "stellar wind is , therefore , postulated to play an important role in producing x  rays .",
    "it is thought that the companion star is very close to filling its roche robe , and the x  ray emission is driven by so  called `` focused wind accretion '' ( @xcite ) .    the long  term monitoring of cyg  x1 revealed that its soft x  ray flux ( @xmath5 10 kev ) shows , on average , two distinct levels ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are often referred to as the low and high states in the literature for historical reasons .",
    "such terminology can often be very confusing because the hard x  ray flux ( @xmath6 10 kev ) is anti  correlated with the soft flux during the transition  the soft x ",
    "ray low state is actually hard x  ray high ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed x  ray properties of cyg  x1 depend strongly on which state it is in .",
    "it is usually in the soft x  ray low state where the energy spectrum is relatively flat ( or hard ) , and can be characterized by a single power law with a photon index of @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "review by @xcite ) .",
    "occasionally , it reaches the soft x ",
    "ray high state where the power  law energy spectrum becomes significantly steeper ( or softer ; with a photon index of @xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , `` hard state '' and `` soft state '' are more precise terms in describing the bi  modal behavior . despite extensive investigation ( observational and theoretical ) for the past couple of decades",
    ", it is still not clear what triggers the spectral transitions .",
    "the x  ray spectrum of cyg  x1 extends beyond 100 kev in both states ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which presents challenge to theoretical models .",
    "it is generally thought that the hard x  ray emission is the result of low  energy photons being up  scattered by hot electrons in the system ( e.g. , @xcite ; review by @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the soft photons probably originate in the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons or the thermal emission from an accretion disk .",
    "however , little is known about the origin of comptonizing electrons .",
    "thermal comptonization requires extremely high electron temperature ( @xmath9 k ) to reach the observed cutoff energy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the preliminary results from a recent simultaneous rxte / osse observation of cyg  x1 in the soft state show that the power  law energy spectrum extends up to @xmath10 600 kev without any breaks ( @xcite ) . if confirmed , they would be at odds with those that require a `` cooled '' comptonizing region in the soft state , and push others to the physical limits as well . alternatively , in the soft state , the bulk motion of relativistic electrons near the black hole may be more efficient in up  scattering soft photons than the thermal motion ( @xcite ) .",
    "calculations show that such bulk motion can produce the observed spectral characteristics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , a tendency that the temporal properties are not emphasized enough and sometimes are completely ignored in the model .",
    "x  ray variability carries rich information about x ",
    "ray emitting regions , instabilities in the accretion disk , temporal evolution of the disk and comptonizing region during the transition , and even the condition about the companion star ( e.g. , roche robe overflow versus focused wind accretion ) .",
    "of course , high signal  to  noise and high timing resolution data are essential for such studies , especially phenomena in the vicinity of the black hole where dynamical time scales are on the order of tens or hundreds of microseconds .",
    "the rxte data have much better simultaneous spectral and timing information than was previously available .",
    "rxte provides unprecedented true @xmath11 timing resolution and covers a broad energy range ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ all  sky monitor _",
    "( asm ; @xcite ) aboard routinely monitors known bright sources ( in the 1.312 kev energy band ) . on 1996",
    "may 10 ( mjd 50213 ) , it revealed that cyg  x1 started a transition from the normal hard state to the soft state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . after reaching the soft state",
    ", it stayed for nearly 2 month before going back down to the hard state ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the asm light curve that covers the entire period .",
    "this period can be divided into 3 distinct phases : ( 1 ) hard  to  soft transition , ( 2 ) soft state , and ( 3 ) soft  to  hard transition .",
    "the transitions are characterized by a fast rise ( or decay ) in the asm flux .",
    "the soft  to  hard transition is nearly a mirror image of the hard  to  soft transition .",
    "although the asm flux of the source is , on average , @xmath100.4 crab in the hard state and @xmath101.1 crab in the soft state , it varies greatly on time scales of minutes to days in both states , with a significantly larger amplitude in the soft state .",
    "snapshots of cyg  x1 were taken with the main pointing detectors on rxte , namely , the _ proportional counter array _",
    "( pca ; 260 kev ) and _ high - energy x  ray timing experiment _",
    "( hexte ; 15250 kev ) , to monitor its temporal and spectral variability throughout the entire period . in this paper",
    "we present the results from the timing analysis of the pca observations .",
    "preliminary spectral and timing results , based on the observations during the hard  to  soft transition and some in the soft state , were already reported in belloni et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and cui et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) . for comparison , however , these observations were re  analyzed in the same way as subsequent ones for the soft state and the soft  to  hard transition .",
    "table  1 briefly summarizes some basic information on the observations , which are also marked with symbols in figure  1 .",
    "as discussed in cui et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ) the source went through a sequence of states with the soft x - ray flux ( @xmath12 kev ) and the hard flux ( @xmath13 kev ) both changing .",
    "the soft flux alone was an incomplete indicator of the states .",
    "the rxte observations with the pointing instruments were only snapshots .",
    "systematic study of the spectral and timing properties during these snapshots and comparison of the batse and asm behavior during the asm soft outburst imply that the source went through a transition over a period of 20 days to a soft state which persisted for about 55 days and then made a transition back to the hard state again taking about 20 days .",
    "the pca observations were made consistently with the following set of data modes ( @xcite ) : a binned mode with 4 ms time bin and 8 energy bands in the range of 213.1 kev , a event mode with 16 @xmath11 time bin and 16 energy bands above 13.1 kev , and two single  bit modes with 122 @xmath11 time bin , covering the energy bands 26.5 kev and 6.513.1 kev , respectively .",
    "the results presented here are derived from the event  mode data and single  bit data . for brevity ,",
    "the energy bands 26.5 kev , 6.513.1 kev , and 13.160 kev are referred to as the soft band , medium band , and hard band , respectively .    since all other observations contain only one orbit worth of data , we chose to break up the first and second observation ( see table  1 ) into individual orbits , each of which was analyzed separately .",
    "it should be noted that the first observation actually consists of only two orbits , but one of the five detectors was turned off ( for safety reasons ) during the second orbit . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "the second orbit was broken up into two segments .",
    "we chose to bin data in @xmath14 s time bin .",
    "for each orbit , we broke up the light curve into 64second segments .",
    "a @xmath15point fft was performed on each segment to obtain a leahy",
    " normalized pds .",
    "the pdss for all segments were then averaged to obtain the average pds , as well as its variance . finally , from the average pds we subtracted the poisson noise power corrected for instrument dead  time effects .",
    "the kind of effects of dead time caused by good events were discussed by zhang et al .",
    "simulations show that for the real detectors , in which several effects compete ( @xcite ) , the effective dead - time can be described by the non - paralyzable formula ( equation ( 44 ) in zhang et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) with the detector dead - time @xmath16 ( w. zhang , private communication ) . in our case",
    "the time bin size @xmath17 and the formula is much simplified because @xmath18 and the count rate is low ( the time between events is large compared to the dead time ) .",
    "there is some spectral dependence to the dead time and while we know the form and approximate numbers , we can expect that the numbers should be adjusted .",
    "a second effect needs to be taken into account ( as described in appendix f of the xte nra and in zhang et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) , the dead time due to very large events in the detector .",
    "no transmission of events is allowed for a set amount of time . for observations # 5-#12 this was set to a value of about @xmath19 , and for the others it was @xmath20 .",
    "it is not a significant correction for the cyg  x-1 observations .    to estimate the uncertainty in calculating poisson noise power",
    ", we obtained the pdss that extend up to @xmath21 khz by using finer time bins .",
    "we searched but failed to detect any qpos at frequencies above 30 hz in all observations .",
    "after carefully examining the pds shape , it became apparent that the power in the highest frequency bins was purely due to photon counting statistics .",
    "we then compared the measured high  frequency power to the calculated value , and concluded that roughly 99.5% of the poisson noise power should have been removed by following the dead time correction procedure we described .",
    "the residual becomes significant starting at @xmath1030 hz , which determined the finest time bin size we could use without losing information from pds .    to facilitate the comparison of the results in different energy bands and from different observations , the power density is presented as the fractional rms variability , which can be derived by dividing the leahy",
    " normalized pds by the mean count rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hard  to  soft transition was covered by the first 3 observations ( a total of 7 orbits worth of data ) , while the soft  to  hard transition by the last three ( see table  1 ) . in both phases ,",
    "the observed pds exhibits very similar characteristics . for the purpose of illustration ,",
    "figures  2 and 3 show the pdss in the soft , medium , and hard band , as well as the total passing band , for observations # 3 and # 15 , respectively , representative of each phase .",
    "from the figures , the pds can be characterized by a red noise component at low frequencies , followed by a white noise component that extends to 13 hz , above which it is cut off . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the pds becomes power law again , with a much steeper slope ( roughly -2 , i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "with respect to this model of continuum , a qpo is detected in all observations . to quantify the characteristics , we model the continuum with the following function : @xmath23 where c is a constant chosen so that @xmath24 is the integrated fraction rms amplitude of the continuum in the frequency range of 0.0232 hz . the qpo is modeled by a lorentzian function , i.e. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the integrated fractional rms amplitude of the qpo , @xmath27 is the qpo centroid frequency , and g is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "fit models are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the errors shown represent 1@xmath28 confidence level .",
    "this simple model characterizes the data reasonably well , as indicated by the reduced @xmath29 of the fit .",
    "the pds continuum varies little on a time scale of days ( the time between observations ) , except for the high  frequency cutoff ( @xmath30 ) which changes quite significantly . on a shorter time scale ( between orbits )",
    ", however , @xmath30 remains quite stable .",
    "it is worth noting that the derived power ",
    "law slope of the red noise ( @xmath31 ) can be somewhat uncertain because of the narrow frequency range covered in the fit .",
    "it is actually closer to -1 ( i.e. , @xmath32 noise ) when longer baselines are used ( cui et al .",
    "1997a , b ) . also shown in figure  2 is that the continuum is energy dependent : the white noise power decreases as the photon energy increases , while @xmath30 remains roughly constant .",
    "the qpo moves around significantly during the transition .",
    "there are no apparent correlations between the qpo characteristics and the total count rate  see figure  4 .",
    "however , the qpo is energy dependent : it becomes more prominent at higher energies , as shown in figures  2 and 3 . to investigate any spectral dependence of the qpo",
    ", we define the following hardness ratios : soft hardness ratio ( hr1 ) is the ratio of the total source counts in the medium band to that in the soft band , and the hard hardness ratio ( hr2 ) the hard band to the medium band .",
    "both hardness ratios were plotted against the qpo fraction rms amplitude in figure  5 . with limited statistics , the qpo appears to strengthen as the energy spectrum becomes harder .",
    "moreover , the qpo centroid frequency ( @xmath27 ) shows strong anti ",
    "correlation with the fractional rms amplitude ( @xmath26 ) and correlation with @xmath30  see figure  6 , which is made from table  2 .      starting from observation # 4",
    ", subsequent 9 observations cover the soft state which is characterized by a power  law pds ( @xcite ; cui et al .",
    "1997a , b ) . as an example",
    ", figure  7 shows the pdss for observation # 6 in the energy bands defined previously .",
    "the white noise is hardly detectable in this state , so the continuum is much simplified .",
    "it was modeled by a broken power law , @xmath33 where c is a constant chosen so that @xmath24 is the integrated fraction rms amplitude of the continuum in the frequency range of 0.0232 hz . examining figure  7 more carefully , there appears to be some deviation from the power ",
    "law around 6 hz .",
    "such feature is so broad and can hardly be called a qpo . for simplicity ,",
    "these broad `` bumps '' are also modeled by the lorentzian function in equation ( 2 ) . the best ",
    "fit models are shown in table  3 .",
    "in general , adding a qpo  like feature does statistically improve the fit , but such features are weak , and are not required at all in some cases .",
    "the centroid of these bumps clusters around 67 hz .",
    "the continuum varies little in the soft state .",
    "the overall pds is dominated by the low ",
    "frequency 1/f noise , more so in the high energy bands .",
    "the pds breaks consistently at @xmath10 1314 hz , except for observations # 9 and # 12 . at higher frequencies , the pds steepens , with the power ",
    "law slope ranging from -1.9 to -2.6 , which is very similar to that during the transition .      as in the previous section",
    ", we derived the average pds and cross spectral function ( defined below ) for each orbit worth of data by following the same procedure , except for a finer time bin size ( @xmath34 s ) adopted and @xmath35point fft performed on each 64second segment .",
    "it should be pointed out that the _ unnormalized _ pds is used in the calculation .",
    "because of the finer time bin size , much wider frequency range is covered . however , as noted in the previous section , the error in estimating poisson noise power becomes significant above @xmath1032 hz , so the results at high frequencies should be taken with reservation .",
    "assuming that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the fourier series calculated for two energy bands , # 1 and # 2 , the cross spectral function ( csf ) between them is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the complex conjugate of @xmath36 .      if r(f ) and i(f ) are the real and imaginary parts of csf , the average phase difference between the two energy bands is given by @xmath40 where angle brackets stand for ensemble averaging .",
    "its variance was estimated by simply propagating errors , i.e. , @xmath41 the average time lag ( or advance if negative ) of x ",
    "rays in energy band # 2 with respect to those in energy band # 1 is then given by @xmath42    the soft band is used as a reference band . for each of the observations listed in table  1 ,",
    "the hard x  ray time lags are computed for the medium and hard bands with respect to the soft band . as for the pds , the measured hard x  ray time lag also shows very similar characteristics within each transition and between the transitions , but are markedly different between the transition and the soft state . to illustrate this point ,",
    "the results for observations # 3 , # 6 , and # 15 ( one in each phase ) are summarized in figure  8 . during the transition , hard x",
    " rays clearly lag behind soft ones .",
    "the measured time lag shows a decreasing trend toward high frequency , confirming the ginga results ( @xcite ) .",
    "it show a peak at the qpo frequency  most apparent between the soft and medium bands  showing an additional time delay associated with the phenomenon .",
    "the time lag increases with photon energy . to quantify it , we defined an `` effective '' time lag for each energy band by simply averaging the results in the frequency range of 110 hz , where error bars are small .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  9 for all observations .",
    "we also define an `` effective '' energy for each energy band , @xmath43 where s(e ) is the photon flux at energy e , and r(i , e ) is the detector response matrix that distributes photons at energy e to counts in each pulse - height channel i ; energy integrals are computed over a chosen energy band , while pulse - height channel integrals are over all channels . using the observed photon spectra for phase 1 ( @xcite ) and pca response matrices , the effective energy is computed for each energy band .",
    "roughly , they are @xmath103 kev , @xmath109 kev , and @xmath1027 kev for the soft , medium , and hard bands , respectively , depending only weakly on the exact spectral shape .",
    "therefore , the time lag scales with photon energy roughly as @xmath44 during the transitions , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the effective energies for any two energy bands . in the soft state ,",
    "the time lags become hardly measurable between the same energy bands , and the logarithmic scaling with photon energy also breaks down .      the coherence function is a measure of linear correlation between the two energy bands of interest ( @xcite ) . in the noiseless case ,",
    "it is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the pdss for energy bands # 1 and # 2 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the coherence function takes value in the range of 0 to 1 , with 0 being no correlation and 1 perfect linear correlation .",
    "in reality , noises due to photon counting statistics are always present .",
    "a detailed treatment of such cases was presented and discussed thoroughly in vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) .",
    "we calculated the coherence function , as well as its variance , by following the recipe presented in vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) , which _ only _ applies to the cases of high signal power and high coherence .",
    "as shown in figures 2 , 3 , 7 , the signal power diminishes rapidly at high frequencies , so the coherence function was calculated only at low frequencies .",
    "figure  10 summarizes the results for observations # 3 , # 6 , and # 15 , as an example to show typical characteristics for each of the three phases . during the transition",
    ", the coherence function indicates a good linear correlation between the soft and medium bands , much less so between the soft and hard bands .",
    "nearly perfect linear correlations are observed between all three energy bands in the soft state .    as for the time lag , we averaged the coherence function between 1 and 10 hz for all observations , and plotted the results in figure  11",
    ". clearly , the coherence function jumps around between observations during the transition , but remains quite stable in the soft state .",
    "the observed pds shows apparent evolution during the spectral transition . in the hard state , the pds of cyg  x1 can be characterized by a white noise component that extends up to @xmath100.040.4 hz where it breaks into roughly a single power ",
    "law ( review by @xcite ; @xcite ) . during the hard ",
    "to  soft transition , the white noise weakens , and the cutoff frequency moves up to 13 hz .",
    "in addition , a low  frequency 1/f component appears ( see fig  2 , also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as the source approaches the soft state , the 1/f noise strengthens until it dominates the pds in the soft state ( see fig .",
    "this evolution sequence completely reverses during the soft  to  hard transition ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the absence of the 1/f noise in the hard state and its dominance in the soft state seems to suggest that it is positively correlated with the _ disk _ mass accretion rate which is lower in the hard state and higher in the soft state ( cf .",
    "therefore , it likely originates in the accretion disk .",
    "it can be produced by the fluctuation in the local accretion rate as a result of small random fluctuation in the viscosity ( @xcite ) , or by the superposition of random accretion `` shots '' with long lifetimes ( cf .",
    "the remarkable repeatibility of the properties of cyg x-1 as observed in recurrences of its various states and the similarity of the observed x - ray properties during the transitions from the hard to soft and soft to hard states implies an orderly dependence of the physical processes on some parameter .",
    "what are these processes and the possibilities for the parameter ?",
    "the hard x  ray emission from cyg  x1 in the hard state and in the transition state is probably the product of thermal comptonization . although the exact geometry of the comptonizing hot corona is still unknown",
    " many have been proposed  there is evidence that it is present only in the vicinity of the black hole for x  ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the corona could be formed due to advection  dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or as a post  shock region in a centrifugally supported shock ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is still highly controversial if a shock can be formed , but the essential element is a comptonizing region for both models .",
    "the adaf model does provide an explanation of the different states ( cf .",
    "according to this model , the standard optically thick , geometrically thin disk ( @xcite ) is only present in the outer region , and is truncated near the black hole where an optically  thin hot `` corona '' is formed .",
    "the `` corona '' rotates at sub ",
    "keplerian speed , and dissipates angular momentum via viscous processes , so behaves just like the thin disk .",
    "however , the gas density in the `` corona '' is so low that radiation becomes an inefficient cooling mechanism .",
    "consequently , gravitational energy released in the accretion process heats up the gas , and advects with it into the black hole .",
    "it was shown that when the mass accretion rate is below some critical value , the corona is large and the thin disk is far away from the black hole  this is the low state . as the accretion rate increases , the inner edge of the disk moves inwards and the corona shrinks , due to the increased local compton cooling efficiency ; the source is on its way to the high state .",
    "when the accretion rate exceeds the critical value , this process continues until the inner edge of the disk reaches the last stable orbit  this is the high state .",
    "is the adaf model consistent with our results ?",
    "the answer is yes , at least qualitatively . in previous work ( @xcite ) , we speculated that the white noise perhaps originates near the black hole where dynamical time scale is short compared to the frequency range of the observed power .",
    "it is then filtered by the hot corona to produce the characteristic break ( @xmath30 ) on the pds . the break frequency",
    "would then be determined by the characteristic photon escape time through the corona , i.e. by its physical size ( @xcite ; also a model in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the increase in the break frequency as the source approaches the soft state is consistent with the corona becoming smaller , which would also explain the softer energy spectrum in the soft state ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of the corona during the transitions can then be illustrated by the change in the break frequency .",
    "such a scenario is strongly supported by the measurement of hard x  ray time lag and coherence between different energy bands .",
    "the logarithmic scaling of the observed time lag with photon energy are consistent with the predictions of the thermal comptonization in the corona ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the much smaller lag times of the soft state do not support scaling as the log of the photon energy , implying that the large high temperature corona is not present . the loss of coherence during the transition ( see fig",
    ".  11 ) can also be accounted for by a varying corona .",
    "the coherence function being near unity in the soft state rules out models invoking multiple , uncorrelated emission regions to account for x  ray variability on different time scales ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , the current version of the adaf model can not satisfactorily describe as luminous an x  ray source as cyg  x1 in the hard state .",
    "the maximum luminosity allowed by the model is @xmath50 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath51 is the constant that describes viscosity in the standard thin  disk model ( @xcite ) , and @xmath52 is the eddington luminosity . for a cyg  x1 black hole of about @xmath53 ,",
    "the measured luminosity is about @xmath54 ( @xcite ) , which would require @xmath51 to be on the order of unity .",
    "thus the reason for the hard state configuration is uncertain , but the spectral and temporal properties are qualitatively in accord with several models , to the degree they are specified .",
    "alternatively , a shock could be formed close to the black hole in cyg  x1 . here , the post  shock region provides comptonizing hot electrons , so there is essentially no difference between the two models for the hard state . in the soft state , however , chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ) predicts the formation of a relativistic electron flow rushing towards the black hole , due to much more efficient compton cooling .",
    "the bulk motion of the flow up  scatters soft photons to produce the observed hard x  ray emission .    with a varying corona ,",
    "it is natural to ask if the detected qpo during the transition is of coronal origin . as discussed in section 2.1.1 , there is strong evidence that the observed qpo characteristics are related to hard x  ray or coronal properties : the qpo amplitude increases as the energy spectrum becomes harder ; both the qpo frequency and amplitude are correlated with the pds break frequency ( @xmath30 ) ; and finally there is an extra time delay ( of hard x ",
    "rays ) at the qpo frequency .",
    "therefore , the qpo is likely associated with some resonant oscillation in the corona .",
    "if the hot electron corona is simply a post  shock region , it would not be hard to imagine the presence of shock  induced oscillations .",
    "the observed pds during the transition is very similar to that of some soft x ",
    "ray transients , such as gx  3394 and gs  112468 , often observed in a so  called `` very high state '' ( vhs ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ; belloni et al .",
    "the vhs is characterized by the presence of qpo in the frequency range similar to ours here",
    ". often , both the low  frequency red noise and white noise are present .",
    "moreover , the qpo is thought to be associated with the oscillations in the corona that are triggered by a radiation pressure feedback loop , assuming the x - ray luminosity is super  eddington in this state ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the qpo of cyg  x-1 during the transition can not be due to radiation pressure because the x - ray luminosity is only a few percent of the eddington luminosity .",
    "recently , belloni et al . (",
    "1997 ) showed that a qpo at 6.7 hz was present in gs  1124 - 68 during the transition from its high state to low state .",
    "this bears remarkable similarity to what we see in cyg  x-1 .",
    "based on our results , we conclude that both the white noise and low  frequency 1/f noise are intrinsic to soft `` seed '' photons .",
    "these intrinsic temporal properties are modified by the corona through compton scattering process .",
    "therefore , the change in the high  frequency characteristics ( e.g. , @xmath30 ) is interpreted as evidence for a `` fluctuating '' corona during the spectral transitions .",
    "this scenario is supported by the measurement of hard x  ray time lags and coherence functions during the transition and in the soft state .",
    "the time lag scales roughly logarithmically with emerging photon energy , as predicted by thermal comptonization models , thus is likely to be produced by such a process in the corona .",
    "this scaling relationship does not hold for the soft state , suggesting that new processes might be involved in the x  ray production .",
    "the qpo persists during both the hard  to  soft and soft  to  hard transitions , but moves around between observations . for cyg",
    "x1 , it is likely a coronal phenomenon because its centroid frequency and strength appear to be correlated with the hard x  ray properties , such as the energy spectrum , the pds break frequency , and an extra time delay , that are tied to the corona .",
    "the presence of the qpo makes the pds during the transition very similar to those of soft x ",
    "ray transients in the vhs .",
    "our results are consistent with many of the qualitative features predicted by the adaf model .",
    "recently , the results from the study of long  term spectral evolution of cyg  x1 , based on the asm and batse data , provide further evidence for the motion of the inner edge of the thin disk during the spectral transitions ( @xcite ) , which is an important prediction of the model .",
    "however , the current version of the model still requires extreme values of @xmath51 parameter to account for the observed x ",
    "ray luminosity of cyg  x1 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the bulk motion of relativistic electrons may indeed play a vital role in the soft state .",
    "the hard x - ray emission would then be produced by comptonization due to the bulk motion of the electrons .",
    "much can be learned by quantitatively applying these models to the spectral and temporal results from rxte .",

    "<S> we report the results from our timing analysis of 15 _ rossi x  ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) observations of cygnus  x1 throughout its 1996 spectral transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the entire period can be divided into 3 distinct phases : ( 1 ) transition from the hard state to the soft state , ( 2 ) soft state , and ( 3 ) transition from the soft state back to the hard state . </S>",
    "<S> the observed x  ray properties ( both temporal and spectral ) in phases 1 and 3 are remarkably similar , suggesting that the same physical processes are likely involved in triggering such transitions . the power density spectrum ( pds ) during the transition can be characterized by a low  frequency red noise ( power law ) component , followed by a white noise ( flat ) component which extends to roughly 13 hz where it is cut off , and a steeper power law ( @xmath0 ) at higher frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the x  ray flux also exhibits apparent quasi  periodic oscillation ( qpo ) with the centroid frequency varying in the range of 412 hz . </S>",
    "<S> the qpo shows no correlation with the source flux , but becomes more prominent at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> this type of pds bears resemblance to that of other black hole candidates often observed in a so  called very high state , although the origin of the observed qpo may be very different . </S>",
    "<S> the low  frequency red noise has not been observed in the hard state , thus seems to be positively correlated with the disk mass accretion rate which is presumably low in the hard state and high in the soft state ; in fact , it completely dominates the pds in the soft state . in the framework of thermal comptonization models , cui et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1997a ) speculated that the difference in the observed spectral and timing properties between the hard and soft states is due to the presence of a `` fluctuating '' comptonizing corona during the transition . </S>",
    "<S> here we present the measured hard x  ray time lags and coherence functions between various energy bands , and show that the results strongly support such scenario . </S>"
