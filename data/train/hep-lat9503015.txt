    "it is found that monopoles in u(1 ) and the @xmath0 abelian projection of su(n ) lgt in the maximal abelian gauge@xcite react to the electric flux from a static @xmath1 pair by producing a solenoidal current distribution which confines the flux to a narrow tube .",

    "[ f4.1](a ) and ( b ) , our results are consistent with those of the earlier works , which were obtained from simulations using abelian wilson loops of sizes @xmath71 in ref.@xcite and @xmath71 and @xmath72 in ref.@xcite . in this study",
    "we observe clear signals for @xmath68 at @xmath73 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f4.1](c ) and ( d ) . from fig .",
    "[ f4.1 ] one can see that the electric flux @xmath68 has the peak value on the @xmath44 axis ( @xmath74 ) , then it decreases with the off - axis distance @xmath70 rapidly .",
    "as the @xmath44 separation @xmath19 increases the @xmath68 values also decrease as we expected .",
    "our data also shows that the electric flux @xmath68 basically vanishes within errors at the off - axis distance @xmath75 for all @xmath19 values in fig .",
    "[ f4.1](a)-(d ) .",

    "this is precisely what we found for u(1 ) , ref.@xcite , and is the prediction of the london theory .",
    "the linear combination of @xmath80 is defined as the fluxoid , where @xmath81 is the london penetration depth . for this geometry",
    "the fluxoid gives a lattice delta function at the origin , with the coefficient equal to the total electric flux in the vortex .",
    "the departure of fig .",
    "[ f4.2 ] from this picture is fully explained by the more general ginzburg - landau theory in which the order parameter for superconductivity turns on at a boundary over a finite distance ( called the coherence length ) rather than abruptly at the boundary as in the above case .",
    "the coherence length in the fig .  [ f4.2 ] is the distance at which the profile deviates from the london theory which is @xmath82 .",
    "the london penetration depth is independently determined by the exponential fall - off of @xmath68 .",
    "we also studied the electric flux and monopole current distributions in the unconfined phase .",

    "the significant difference between fig .",
    "[ f4.3 ] and fig .",
    "[ f4.1 ] is that the @xmath68 flux values for @xmath83 approach zero very slowly , even at large off - axis distances ( e.g. @xmath84 ) @xmath68 flux values still do not vanish within errors , as shown clearly in fig .",
    "[ f4.3](c ) and ( d ) . however , fig .",
    "[ f4.1 ] shows that the @xmath68 flux data for @xmath69 decrease very quickly and vanish at @xmath75 within errors .",
    "this implies that the electric flux spreads out from the @xmath44 axis in the unconfined phase ( @xmath83 ) , it is more coulomb - like than the flux distribution in the confined phase ( e.g. @xmath69 ) .",
    "[ f4.4 ] shows the corresponding monopole current distributions @xmath76 for @xmath83 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . from this figure",
    "one can see that almost all data vanish within errors except one small value on the @xmath44 axis ( @xmath74 ) for each case . comparing with the monopole current distributions in the confined phase ( @xmath69 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f4.2 ] it is clear that the solenoidal monopol current @xmath85 becomes very small in the unconfined phase , as expected .",
    "we extend the earlier studies  @xcite on solenoidal monopole current and electric flux distributions to the finite temperature case .",
    "we find that both the electric flux and the monopole current have quite different behaviors in the finite temperature confined and unconfined phases . in the confined phase our data are consistent with the results of earlier works  @xcite , which correspond to the zero - temperature case .",
    "we find that in the confined phase the electric flux is confined in a narrow tube , and the solenoidal monopole currents are large .",
    "however , in the unconfined phase our data show clearly that the electric flux is not confined , and the solenoidal monopole current is vanishingly small .",
    "this presents the significant difference between the two phases .",
    "this study confirms the point that the electric flux is repelled by the surrounding solenoidal monopole currents , and is squeezed into a narrow tube . in the unconfined phase solenoidal monopole current vanishes , then the electric flux is unconfined .",
