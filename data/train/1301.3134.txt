    "finally , the light - cone mock catalogue is intended to mimic the sdss survey and provide a direct test of the model .    when calculating scaled satellite number density profiles , it is necessary to determine the value of @xmath17 ( defined as the radius enclosing a mean total overdensity of 200 times the critical cosmic value ) associated with each primary galaxy . following paper ii ,",
    "@xmath17 is estimated from the stellar mass , inferred from the luminosity and colour of the primary .",
    "this is converted to a halo mass , @xmath22 , using the abundance matching technique of @xcite , from which @xmath17 follows .",

    "this similarity between estimated satellite system sizes in the mock and sdss suggests that scaling the satellite number density profiles by the system size should not create any large systematic differences between the real and mock results .",
    "the distributions of real @xmath17 values , inferred from the dark matter distribution in the simulation cube , are shown with dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_vr ] . for the lower luminosity primaries ,",
    "the real and estimated @xmath17 distributions are similar . however , in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_vr ] it is apparent that there is a significant population of physically small haloes surrounding primary galaxies whose stellar mass corresponds to a larger halo . as pointed out in paper ii , this is probably due to the fact that the stellar mass varies little with halo mass for these most luminous systems .",
    "thus , any small scatter in stellar mass gives rise to a large change in the value of @xmath17 inferred from abundance matching .",
    "this is an important source of potential bias when trying to measure concentrations of satellite distributions around the most luminous primaries . in this case , a concentration derived using the value of @xmath17 estimated from stellar masses will not necessarily reflect the concentration as defined with respect to the halo mass .    finally , as we will be investigating the colour dependence of the results , in fig .  [",
    "fig : color ] we compare the colour distributions of galaxies in the sdss and model galaxy catalogues .",
    "the distribution of sdss galaxies in the colour - magnitude diagram is shifted along the @xmath24 axis compared to that of the model galaxies .",
    "thus , while we choose @xmath25 as the line dividing the red and blue populations in the sdss this boundary is placed at @xmath26 for the model galaxy populations .",
    "these cuts are shown in the 4 panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : color ] , where the effect on the colour magnitude distribution of including the survey flux limit can be seen for the ms .",
    "this removes the bulk of the low luminosity galaxies that are present in the @xmath14 snapshot and makes the resulting light - cone galaxy population significantly more like that in the sdss .",
    "the fraction of the @xmath27 model light - cone galaxies that are defined as red is @xmath28 , the same as that for the sdss .",
    "had we adopted the sdss colour cut , the model would only have had a red galaxy fraction of @xmath29 .",
    "for galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath30 , the red fractions are 0.46 and 0.38 for the model and sdss respectively , when using the cuts shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : color ] .",
    "thus , apart from a magnitude - dependent shift in the colours of galaxies , which we can correct for with the different colour cuts , the global red galaxy fractions are quite similar between model and sdss data sets at magnitudes that we will be considering for the satellite galaxies .",
    "the ms and ms - ii simulations , once populated with galaxies according to the semi - analytic model , contain very similar galaxy populations .",
    "thus , it is appropriate to use them interchangeably depending upon which is more important : having a large volume containing many primaries , or being able to resolve low luminosity satellite galaxies .",
    "however , if we want to compare results from the ms - ii cube of galaxies with those from the sdss flux - limited survey , then we still need to demonstrate , using the ms , that our methods recover from the light - cone mock surveys the same satellite distributions as are present in the simulation cubes .",
    "in this section we briefly review the procedure used to determine the satellite lf and projected number density profile for sdss , described more fully in papers i and ii , before detailing how these distributions are determined from the various different types of model galaxy catalogue . the quality of the recovery of these distributions is quantified by comparing those determined from the ms cube of galaxies with those from the flux - limited mock light - cone surveys .",
    "primary galaxies are selected to have spectroscopic redshifts in the sdss and to have magnitudes , @xmath31 , satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "we choose @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "further , the primaries should be isolated in the sense that no other galaxy within @xmath35 magnitudes lies within a projected distance of @xmath36 and is sufficiently close in redshift . `",
    "sufficiently close ' is defined as a difference in spectroscopic redshift of less than @xmath37 or , for galaxies without a spectroscopic redshift , with a photometric redshift within @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the photometric redshift error defined in paper ii .",
    "@xmath41 represents the projected radius within which satellites may reside , and the variable @xmath42 defines the outer edge of an annulus within which the local background is estimated .",
    "we adopt the same values of @xmath43 as in paper  ii : @xmath44 and @xmath45 for primaries in magnitude bins @xmath46 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "only galaxies brighter than @xmath47 are considered .    only sufficiently close galaxies in redshift",
    "are included when counting the potential satellites within the projected radius @xmath41 and making the local background estimate from the surrounding annulus out to @xmath42 .",
    "the background - subtracted satellite systems are stacked for primaries in each absolute magnitude bin to provide estimates for the mean satellite lfs and projected number density profiles of satellites more luminous than a particular absolute magnitude , as described more fully in papers  i & ii .    the procedure described above is applied to the sdss itself and also to the ms redshift space light - cone mock catalogue .",
    "however , different estimation procedures are used for the light - cone mock with real space ( rather than redshift space ) galaxy coordinates and the galaxy populations in the simulation cubes . with the real space positions , it is possible to define isolated primaries as having no bright neighbours within a sphere of radius @xmath36 .",
    "the satellites within a sphere of radius @xmath41 can also be determined without any need for background subtraction . using only the real space satellites ,",
    "the estimation of the satellite luminosity function is straightforward . for the @xmath48th magnitude bin",
    ", the average satellite lf is estimated using    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the number of satellites around primary @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the number of primaries contributing to the @xmath48th bin of the lf .",
    "while we need no correction for interlopers in real space , the process of estimating the mean projected number density of satellite galaxies is such that a fair comparison with light - cone data still requires the subtraction of a background estimated from an outer area .",
    "hence , the projected number density profiles of satellites brighter than @xmath53 in real space are determined using all galaxies within a cylinder of projected radius @xmath42 and length @xmath54 , centred on the primary .",
    "these galaxies are projected onto a plane and provide the sources for the potential satellites / background for projected radii less / greater than @xmath41 .",
    "the projected number density profile is determined using @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath53 within a projected distance @xmath41 of the @xmath51th primary and in the @xmath48th projected annulus , and @xmath57 is the corresponding number of galaxies in the projected outer annulus , @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is the area contributed by the @xmath51th primary to the @xmath48th annulus for the detection of satellites brighter than @xmath53 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the area of the @xmath48th annulus surrounding the @xmath51th primary and @xmath62 is the absolute magnitude that corresponds to the apparent magnitude limit of the mock catalogue .",
    "@xmath63 is the corresponding area in the outer annulus surrounding the @xmath51th primary .",
    "the comparison of the projected number density profiles , before and after background subtraction , with that formed by simply projecting the galaxies within a sphere of radius @xmath41 of the primary galaxy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] .",
    "the results indicate that the projected profile after subtracting the background very accurately recovers that estimated directly from the galaxies within the inner area ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the impact of the background subtraction is small and limited to radii near to @xmath41 .",
    "this establishes that the method for calculating the background subtracted projected number density profile from a real space light - cone survey provides an unbiased estimate of that produced when only satellites within a 3d distance @xmath41 are used .",

    "converge , whereas this does not happen for the model .",
    "the shape of the projected density profiles of red satellites are very similar for the model and sdss systems , once the difference in amplitude has been scaled away , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sat_color ] . however , this is not the case for the blue satellites , which have a much less concentrated distribution around model primaries . for real systems of blue satellites ,",
    "the distribution is only slightly less concentrated than it is for the red satellites .",
    "the comparison of galactic satellite systems in the model with those in the sdss shows that the dependence of the satellite distributions on primary and satellite luminosity is captured quite well by the galform  model .",
    "this is a non - trivial success of the model since its parameters were adjusted merely to match the global k - band lf of galaxies , with no direct reference to satellite systems .",
    "there is an excess of very low luminosity satellites around sdss primaries relative to the model , and the projected number density profiles are up to a factor 2 discrepant within @xmath73 , but the agreement is generally good .",
    "@xcite also studied the radial distribution of satellite systems around bright primary galaxies using sdss data .",
    "their primaries were lrgs at @xmath87 with no isolation criteria applied and hence often in groups of bright galaxies , and thus are different to those studied here in a few respects that may well be important .",
    "they found the projected number density was well fitted by a combination of a projected nfw profile @xcite for large radii and a central steeper profile that follows the stacked light profile of the lrgs .",
    "this central bump is similar to that seen for the lower luminosity satellites around primary galaxies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pro ] , but is , in contrast , most apparent in the high luminosity satellites around the lrgs .",
    "the differences between the model and sdss satellite systems are greater when the colour of the satellites is considered .",
    "even the distribution of galaxies in the colour - magnitude plane shows that the model has too high a fraction of low luminosity red galaxies relative to the sdss .",
    "the model blue satellites are both significantly depleted and very much less concentrated relative to either blue or red sdss satellites , which have a projected number density profile like that of the red model satellites .",
    "these pieces of evidence point to the model being too ready to convert low luminosity blue galaxies to red ones .    .",

    "the middle panel shows the profiles of all satellites , whereas the lower panel shows them split by colour.,title=\"fig:\",width=291 ]    @xcite suggest that galaxy formation models have a generic problem with maintaining sufficient gas to form stars in lower mass galaxies at low redshift .",
    "the satellite galaxies we are considering are somewhat larger than those studied by @xcite , and our choice of different colour cuts for defining red and blue galaxies in the model and sdss samples reduces global systematic colour differences .",
    "for instance , the overall fraction of blue galaxies in the model , at the magnitudes of the satellites that we focus on , is very similar to that in the sdss .",
    "satellite galaxies in our study constitute only a small fraction of the total population of galaxies .",
    "thus , a dramatic change in the satellite properties will leave very little imprint on the global lf .",
    "alternatively , it could be that semi - analytical galaxies turn red too rapidly after accretion into larger haloes .",
    "this idea was investigated by @xcite , who changed the galform  treatment of gas stripping from subhaloes as they enter the virial radius of large primary galaxies . rather than hot gas being stripped from subhaloes immediately",
    "as they enter the virial radius , a more gradual loss of gas is adopted in the @xcite model .",
    "this allows a relatively extended period of star formation to occur and the possiblity of bluer satellites .",
    "we have performed our analysis on a model galaxy population constructed using this particular variant of the @xcite galform  model . while the typical colours of galaxies do become slightly bluer , the number of blue satellites per primary in the @xcite model increases only slightly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : font ] .",
    "the shape of the blue satellite profile improves significantly , with the extra blue satellites being found preferentially at small radii .",
    "however , the abundance of red satellites is also increased by this modification to the galform  model , because satellites generally become more luminous as a result of the more extended period of star formation . as a result , the @xcite model overproduces satellite abundances overall , as shown in the upper two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : font ] .",
    "the overproduction is most discrepant with the data at low luminosities .",
    "many important astrophysical processes combine to determine the distribution of low luminosity galaxies .",
    "therefore the distributions of satellite galaxies will depend sensitively on aspects of the galaxy formation model .",
    "given that the treatment of gas stripping can have the large impact shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : font ] , one is drawn to conclude that the ability of the default @xcite model to match the total satellite lf and projected number density profile of the sdss systems was far from inevitable .",
    "using model galaxy catalogues constructed using large dark matter simulations and a semi - analytic galaxy formation model , we have tested the accuracy of our procedures for measuring properties of the distribution of satellite galaxies around bright , isolated primary galaxies .",
    "we find that our local estimation of the abundance of background galaxies yields unbiased estimates of the satellite galaxy luminosity function and projected number density profile .",
    "the agreement between results in the ms and ms - ii galaxy catalogues in their region of overlap shows that our results are numerically converged and allows us to extend the dynamic range of the model predictions .    comparing the model predictions with those measured for satellite systems in the sdss , we find that the dependence of the satellite lf is matched well for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "lower luminosity satellites are increasingly underpredicted by the model .",
    "the projected number density profile is also well reproduced at radii greater than @xmath73 . at smaller radii ,",
    "deviations in the abundance by a factor of two are apparent .",
    "these differences between model and sdss are seen most strongly in the low luminosity satellites , which show an excess in the sdss relative to the extrapolation of the power law from larger radii , which describes the inner regions of the model satellite systems .    splitting the sample into red and blue galaxies",
    "produces more dramatic differences between the model and sdss results .",
    "the model places a factor @xmath83 fewer satellites around blue primaries than are present around comparable sdss primaries .",
    "however , the discrepancy between model and sdss is even larger when considering the colours of the satellites .",
    "the model satellites are predominantly red , in contrast to the blue - dominated sdss satellite galaxy population .",
    "furthermore , what model blue satellites there are have a significantly more extended distribution around their primary galaxy than is seen for either the sdss blue satellites or the red satellites in the model and sdss .",
    "the generally successful comparison of the galform  model with the sdss data performed here provides a non - trivial validation of the assumptions and framework of this kind of modelling . at the same time",
    ", the failure of the model to account for the observed colour dependence of the satellite properties demonstrates that the model is incomplete and that important physical processes , almost certainly related to the rapidity with which infalling satellite galaxies turn red , are not being faithfully modelled . since",
    "a similar shortcoming is present in the independent model of @xcite , this problem seems deep - rooted and is worthy of further investigation .",
