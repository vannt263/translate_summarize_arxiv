    "it is a corollary of the sard s theorem that @xmath46 is a smooth fiber bundle away from finitely many critical points , say @xmath49 .",
    "the genus of the regular fiber of @xmath46 is defined to be the genus of the lefschetz fibration .",
    "if a fiber passes through critical point set @xmath50 , then it is called a singular fiber which is an immersed surface with a single transverse self - intersection .",
    "a singular fiber can be described by its monodromy , an element of the mapping class group @xmath25 , where @xmath8 is the genus of the lefschetz fibration .",
    "this element is a right handed dehn twist along a simple closed curve on @xmath51 , called the _ vanishing cycle_. if this curve is a nonseparating curve , then the singular fiber is called _ nonseparating _ , otherwise it is called _ separating_. for a genus @xmath8 lefschetz fibration over @xmath52 , the product of right handed dehn twists @xmath53 along the vanishing cycles @xmath54 , for @xmath55 , gives us the global monodromy of the lefschetz fibration , the relation @xmath56 in @xmath25 .",

    "we closely follow the proof of lemma 3.1 in @xcite , see also the discussion in @xcite .",

    "in fact , it is shown that the braid monodromy around the point at infinity in @xmath78 , which is given by the central element @xmath79 in @xmath80 , can be written as the product of the monodromies about the critical points of the projection map @xmath81 .",
    "more precisely , the following factorization @xmath82 holds in the braid group @xmath80 , where @xmath83 is a positive half - twist exchanging two points , and fixing the remaining @xmath84 points .",
    "we first degenerate the smooth algebraic curve @xmath70 in @xmath69 into a union of @xmath85 lines in a general position ( see figure  [ fig : branch ] ) .",
    "the braid group factorization corresponding to the configuration @xmath70 is given by @xmath86 . by lifting this braid factorization to the mapping class group of the genus two surface",
    ", we obtain that the monodromy factorization @xmath68 for the corresponding double branched covering .",
    "notice that a regular fiber of the given fibration is a two fold cover of a sphere with homology class @xmath87 branched over @xmath85 points , where @xmath45 denotes the hyperplane class in @xmath74 .",
    "thus a regular fiber is a surface of genus two .",
    "the exceptional sphere @xmath88 in @xmath69 , which intersects @xmath87 positively at one point , gives rise to two disjoint @xmath89 sphere sections to the given genus two lefschetz fibration on @xmath1 .    ]    below we prove key proposition , which plays an important role in the proof of our main theorems .",
    "the following proposition also gives an alternative and convenient way of thinking the genus two lefschetz fibration on @xmath1 over @xmath52 with the monodromy @xmath68 .",
    "[ e1 ] the genus two lefschetz pencil on @xmath90 with two base points given above can be constructed by symplectic fiber summing two copies of @xmath91 along a regular torus fiber .",
    "since the fiber of the elliptic fibration on @xmath91 is a blow up of a generic cubic curve in @xmath74 , its homology class is equal to @xmath92 , where @xmath45 denotes the hyperplane class in @xmath74 and @xmath93 is the homology class of the exceptional sphere of the @xmath94 blow - up .",
    "we first consider the pencil of lines in @xmath74 all passing through the fixed point @xmath95 away from the cubic curve @xmath96 in @xmath74 .",
    "observe that each generic line @xmath73 , which is a sphere of self - intersection @xmath97 , in this pencil intersects the cubic curve @xmath96 at three distinct points by bezout s theorem .",
    "furthermore , by applying the riemann - hurwitz formula to the restriction of the map @xmath98 to @xmath96 , we compute the degree of the ramification divisor @xmath99 : @xmath100 . consequently , for a generic smooth cubic @xmath96 , there are exactly six lines in the pencil above that are tangent to @xmath96 .",
    "next , we choose the regular torus fiber @xmath101 along which the fiber sum of two copies of @xmath91 will be performed .",
    "since the generic elliptic fiber of @xmath91 intersects the lines of the corresponding pencil at three points ( see figure  [ fig : genustwopencil ] ) , the generic line of the pencil in each @xmath102 intersects the boundary of @xmath103 in three disjoint circles .",
    "we choose a gluing diffeomorphism @xmath104 , that identities these circles as in figure  [ fig : braided ] to obtain a pencil of genus two curves in @xmath105 surface .",
    "since the pencils in each copy of @xmath102 are holomorphic and the gluing map on the boundary @xmath106-torus is identity on the elliptic fiber , the resulting genus two pencil is holomorphic as well . by holomorphically blowing up this genus two pencils at base points of the pencil @xmath107 and @xmath108 in @xmath90 surface , we obtain the genus two holomorphic fibration on @xmath1 .",
    "this holomorphic fibration has six singular fibers resulting from the gluing of six tangent lines mentioned above in each copy of @xmath102 .",
    "these singular fibers are not a lefschetz type , and each singularity is topologically a sphere .",
    "furthermore , using the analysis of the singular fibers , we see that each singular fiber can be perturbed into five lefschetz type singularities with non - separating vanishing cycles ( see the braid monodromy discussion in @xcite , page 5 ) .",
    "finally , using the result of b. siebert and g. tian , theorem a in @xcite , on holomorphicity of genus two lefschetz fibration , we see that the fibration is isomorphic to the one given in lemma [ e ] .",
    "the isomorphism of fibrations also follows from the proof of lemma [ e ] ( see also discussion in @xcite , page 5 ) by considering the degree , and the braid monodromy of the ramification divisor .",
    "first , we view the fiber sum of two copies of @xmath102 as a two - fold ramified branched cover of @xmath102 along the smooth divisor in the class @xmath109 , twice the anticanonical divisor of @xmath102 .",
    "a pencil of lines in @xmath74 with one base point gives rise to a pencil of lines in @xmath102 with one base point assuming that we blow up the pencil @xmath110 times away from the basepoint .",
    "since a generic line in the pencil , which has class @xmath45 , intersects the ramification divisor @xmath111 at six points , it determines a genus two pencil under two - fold cover .",
    "notice that the braid monodromy of a smooth plane curve of degree six ( i.e. , of a ramification divisor ) , can be computed by degenerating it into the union of six lines in generic position and given by @xmath68 .",

    ", we will also derive some useful facts about the genus two lefschetz pencil on @xmath90 with two base points given above .",
    "let us think of @xmath90 surface as the fiber sum of two copies of @xmath113 along a torus fiber as in proposition  [ e1 ] .",
    "we choose the following basis for the intesection form of @xmath102 : @xmath114 .",

    "the class @xmath46 is fiber of an elliptic fibration on @xmath113 and @xmath119 is a sphere section of self - intersection @xmath89 .",
    "when we perform the fiber sum along torus to obtain @xmath120 , it is not hard to see the surfaces that generate the intersection form @xmath121 for @xmath120 , where @xmath67 is a hyperbolic pair .",
    "the two copies of the milnor fiber @xmath122 are in @xmath120 , providing @xmath123 spheres of self - intersection @xmath116 ( corresponding to the classes @xmath124 and @xmath125 mentioned above ) , realize two copies of @xmath117 .",
    "one copy of hyperbolic pair @xmath67 comes from an identification of the torus fibers @xmath46 and @xmath126 , and a sphere section @xmath127 of self - intersection @xmath116 obtained by sewing the sphere sections @xmath128 and @xmath129 , i.e. from the gompf s nucleus @xmath130 in @xmath120 .",
    "the remaining two copies of @xmath67 come from @xmath18 rim tori and their dual @xmath116 spheres ( see discussion in @xcite , page 73 ) ) .",
    "these @xmath131 classes ( @xmath132 spheres and @xmath106 tori ) generate @xmath133 of @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath134 , @xmath120 has a trivial canonical class .",
    "as we can see from the figure  [ fig : genustwopencil ] , the class of the genus two surface of square @xmath18 of the genus two lefschetz pencil on @xmath90 is @xmath135 , we simply add the homology classes of the surfaces . as a consequence ,",
    "the class of the genus two fiber in @xmath1 is given by @xmath136 , where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the homology classes of the exceptional spheres of the blow - ups at the points @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we can also verify the symplectic surface @xmath51 , given by the class @xmath136 , has genus two by applying the adjunction formula to @xmath139 : @xmath140 + [ \\sigma]^2 ) = 1 + ( ( e_{1 } + e_{2 } ) \\cdot ( h + h ' - e_{1 } - e_{2 } ) + ( h + h ' - e_{1 } - e_{2})^2)/2 = 1 + ( 2 + 0)/2 = 2 $ ] . the reader can notice from the intersection form of @xmath90 that both rim tori has no intersections with the genus surface in the pencil given by the homology class @xmath135 .",

    "we continue to use the notation of the figure  [ fig : sigma2 ] , by choosing a base point @xmath276 as in @xmath270 as in figure  [ fig : basepoint ] . from the long exact homotopy sequence ( see , for example@xcite , page 290 ) , we deduce that    @xmath277    moreover , @xmath278 is finitely presented group and generated by the images of the standard generators , which we again denote by @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 , under the surjection map .",

    "furthermore , the relations @xmath289 imply that the elements @xmath274 and @xmath275 are null - homotopic and thus @xmath42 is simply connected .    using the blow up formula for the seiberg - witten function @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath290 @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is an exceptional class coming from the @xmath94 blow up .",
    "consequently , it follows from this formula , the set of basic classes of @xmath293 are given by @xmath294 , and the seiberg - witten invariants on these classes are @xmath295 .",
    "moreover , after performing two rational blowdowns along a copy of the configuration @xmath2 , the resulting manifold is diffeomorphic to @xmath90 by lemma  [ n=2 ] .",

    "next , using the corollary 8.6 in  @xcite , we observe that @xmath42 has seiberg - witten simple type . furthermore , by applying theorem  [ sw1 ] and theorem  [ sw2 ] , we completely determine the seiberg - witten invariants of @xmath42 using the basic classes and invariants of @xmath90 : up to sign the symplectic manifold @xmath42 has only one basic class which descends from the canonical class of @xmath90 . by theorem  [ sw2 ] ( or by taubes theorem @xcite ) ,",

    "furthemore , by considering three regions on the genus two surface , where the rational blowdowns are performed ( see figures  [ fig : special1 ] and [ fig : special2 ] ) , and the location of the two points where we did blow up the genus two pencil ( see figures  [ fig : braided ] and [ fig : genustwopencil ] ) , we compute the intersection numbers as follows : let @xmath299 denote the homology class of @xmath16 sphere of @xmath177 .",

    "@xmath294 only @xmath303 and @xmath304 have intersection @xmath305 with @xmath16 spheres of @xmath2 , it follows from theorem  [ sw1 ] that these are only two classes that descend to @xmath42 .",
    "next , we apply the connected sum theorem for the seiberg - witten invariant and show that @xmath306 function is trivial for @xmath264 .",

    "an alternative proof , using the homology classes , is given in example  [ ex ] .",

    "let us explain this more precisely using a geometric argument .",
    "first , note that according to the proof of lemma  [ e ] any genus two fiber , which arises from a two - fold cover of the sphere @xmath310 , meets the torus @xmath311 descending from an elliptic fiber of @xmath90 at two points .",

    "the dots in the disks indicate there are @xmath314 singulars fibers over each disk @xmath315 .",
    "we choose an open set @xmath316 on the torus @xmath311 which contains the disks @xmath313 , and away from the loops @xmath317 and @xmath318 ( see figure  [ fig : rimtorus ] ) .",
    "thus , we can assume that the rational blowdown surgeries have no effect on the outside the tubular neighborhood of @xmath316 .",
    "next , we will choose a rim circle @xmath319 away from the tubular neighborhood of @xmath316 .",
    "the rim tori that are not affected by six rational blowdowns are @xmath320 and @xmath321 ( figure",
