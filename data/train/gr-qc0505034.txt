    "the observations of high redshift supernovae @xcite and the boomerang / maxima data @xcite , showing that the location of the first acoustic peak in the power spectrum of the microwave background radiation is consistent with the inflationary prediction @xmath0 , have provided compelling evidence for a net equation of state of the cosmic fluid lying in the range @xmath1 .",
    "to explain these observations , two dark components are invoked : the pressureless cold dark matter ( cdm ) and the dark energy ( de ) with negative pressure .",
    "cdm contributes @xmath2,and is mainly motivated by the theoretical interpretation of the galactic rotation curves and large scale structure formation .",
    "de is assumed to provide @xmath3 and is responsible for the acceleration of the distant type ia supernovae .",
    "there are a huge number of candidates for de in the literature ( for recent reviews see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , neither cdm nor de has direct laboratory observational or experimental evidence for its existence",
    ". it would be important if a unified dark matter -dark energy scenario could be found , in which these two components are different manifestations of a single fluid @xcite .",
    "a candidate for such an unification is the so - called generalized chaplygin gas , which is an exotic fluid with the equation of state @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two parameters to be determined .",
    "it was initially suggested by kamenshchik , moschella and pasquier @xcite with @xmath7 , and then generalized by bento , bertolami and sen @xcite for the case @xmath8 .",
    "the chaplygin gas also appears in the stabilization of branes in schwarzschild - ads black hole bulks as a critical theory at the horizon ka00 and in the stringy analysis of black holes in three dimensions ka98 .",
    "the chaplygin equation of state can also be derived from born - infeld type lagrangians @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this simple and elegant model smoothly interpolates between a non - relativistic matter phase ( @xmath9 ) and a negative - pressure dark energy dominated phase .",
    "the cosmological implications of the chaplygin gas model have been intensively investigated in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas cosmological model has been constrained by using different cosmological observations , like type ia supernovae @xcite , @xcite , the cmb anisotropy measurements @xcite , gravitational lensing surveys de03 , the age measurement of high redshift objects @xcite and the x - ray gas mass fraction of clusters @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are somewhat controversial , with some of them claiming good agreement between the data and the chaplygin gas model , while the rest ruling it as a feasible candidate for dark matter . in particular , the standard chaplygin gas model with @xmath7",
    "is ruled out by the data at a 99% level @xcite .    the embedding approach to gravity , according to which our four - dimensional space - time is a three - brane , embedded in a five - dimensional space - time ( the bulk ) , has a long history , beginning at least with the classic book by eisenhart @xcite .",
    "more recently , this idea was considered by akama @xcite and rubakov and shaposhnikov @xcite ( an exhaustive list of references on the early articles published in this field can be found in bandos and kummer @xcite and pavsic and tapia @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "recently , due to the proposal by randall and sundrum @xcite the idea of the embedding of our universe in a higher dimensional space had attracted again a considerable interest . according to the brane - world scenario , the physical fields ( electromagnetic , yang - mills etc . ) in our four - dimensional universe are confined to the three brane .",
    "these fields are assumed to arise as fluctuations of branes in string theories .",
    "only gravity can freely propagate in both the brane and bulk space - times , with the gravitational self - couplings not significantly modified .",
    "this model originated from the study of a single @xmath10-brane embedded in five dimensions , with the @xmath11 metric given by @xmath12 , which , due to the appearance of the warp factor , could produce a large hierarchy between the scale of particle physics and gravity .",
    "even if the fifth dimension is uncompactified , standard @xmath13 gravity is reproduced on the brane .",
    "hence this model allows the presence of large , or even infinite non - compact extra dimensions .",
    "our brane is identified to a domain wall in a @xmath14-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time . for a review of dynamics and geometry of brane universes",
    "see @xcite .",
    "due to the correction terms coming from the extra dimensions , significant deviations from the einstein theory occur in brane world models at very high energies @xcite .",
    "gravity is largely modified at the electro - weak scale @xmath15 tev .",
    "the cosmological implications of the brane world theories have been extensively investigated in the physical literature @xcite .",
    "gravitational collapse can also produce high energies , with the five dimensional effects playing an important role in the formation of black holes @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the non - local effects , generated by the free gravitational field of the bulk in a conformally symmetric brane , may provide an explanation for the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the galactic center , and hence provide a purely gravitational explanation for the existence of dark matter , was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the behavior and the properties of the anisotropic bianchi type i brane - world for different type of matter sources , including inflationary scalar fields , have been intensively investigated in the framework of the brane world cosmologies @xcite .",
    "the study of anisotropic homogeneous brane world cosmological models have shown an important difference between these models and standard four - dimensional general relativity , namely , that brane universes are born in an isotropic state . for bianchi type i and v geometries this type of behavior has been found both by exactly solving the gravitational field equations @xcite , or from the qualitative analysis of the model @xcite . a general analysis of the anisotropy in spatially homogeneous brane world cosmological models has been performed by coley @xcite , who has shown that the initial singularity is isotropic , and hence the initial conditions problem is naturally solved . consequently , close to the initial singularity , these models do not exhibit mixmaster or chaotic - like behavior @xcite . based on the results of the study of homogeneous anisotropic cosmological models coley conjectured that the isotropic singularity could be a general feature of brane cosmology .",
    "the analytic study of the values of the anisotropy in the limit of small times shows that for all bianchi type space - times filled with a non - zero pressure cosmological fluid , obeying a barotropic equation of state , the initial singular state on the brane is isotropic @xcite .",
    "this result is obtained by assuming that in the limit of small times the asymptotic behavior of the scale factors is of kasner - type . for brane worlds",
    "filled with dust or with a scalar field , the initial value of the anisotropy coincides in both brane world and standard four - dimensional general relativistic cosmologies .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate some classes of exact solutions of the gravitational field equations in the brane world model for the anisotropic bianchi type i geometry , by assuming that the matter source on the brane consist of a generalized chaplygin gas . in this case",
    "the general solution of the field equations can be obtained in an exact parametric form , for arbitrary values of the parameters characterizing the equation of state of the matter .",
    "the inclusion of the quadratic terms in the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect cosmological fluids leads to major changes in the early dynamics of the anisotropic universe , as compared to the standard general relativistic case .",
    "we also consider the brane dynamics of the scalar field associated to the chaplygin case and obtain the corresponding self - interaction potential .",
    "the behavior of the observationally important physical quantities like anisotropy , shear and deceleration parameters is considered in detail for all these models .    the present paper is organized as follows . the gravitational field equations for a chaplygin gas on a brane with an anisotropic bianchi type i geometry are written down in section ii . in section iii we present the general solution of the field equations . in section iii",
