    "recently it was predicted that the core of an abrikosov vortex in bulk type - ii superconductors is charged  @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs because of the difference of the chemical potential in the superconducting versus normal state .",
    "such a change in chemical potential results in a redistribution of the electrons in the region near the vortex core and culminates in a charging of the vortex core when the superconductor is in the mixed state  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate this phenomenon in mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "a mesoscopic sample has a typical size which is comparable to the coherence length @xmath0 and the magnetic field penetration length @xmath1 .",
    "the behaviour of such structures in an external magnetic field @xmath2  is strongly influenced by the sample shape  @xcite  and may lead to various superconducting states and different phase transitions between them .",
    "jumps in magnetization were observed when the applied magnetic field or temperature @xmath3 are varied  @xcite .",
    "a number of earlier works studied the geometry dependent magnetic response of mesoscopic superconductors : i )  disk shape samples  @xcite ; ii )  infinitely long cylinders  @xcite ; iii )  ring - like structures  @xcite  and more complicated geometries  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of mesoscopic superconductors are based on the phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory  @xcite  which successfully describes mesoscopic samples in a wide @xmath4-@xmath5 region .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that in mesoscopic samples ( disks or cylinders ) surrounded by a vacuum or an insulator two kinds of superconducting states can exist .",
    "firstly , there is a circular symmetric state with a fixed value of angular momentum , called giant vortex . the observed magnetization jumps correspond to first order phase transitions between giant vortices with different angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "secondly , in samples with a sufficiently large radius multi - vortex structures  @xcite can nucleate  which are the analogue of the abrikosov flux line lattice in a bulk superconductor .",
    "these states can be represented as a mixture of giant vortex states with different angular momentum . for multi - vortex states",
    "it is also possible to introduce an effective total angular momentum , which is nothing else then the number of vortices in the disk , i.e. the vorticity . with changing the magnetic field",
    "there is a second order phase transition between the multi - vortex and the giant vortex state  @xcite .",
    "it is expected , that the charge distribution in such mesoscopic samples may be appreciably altered due to the presence of a boundary .",
    "furthermore , screening currents near the boundary of the sample will also lead to a redistribution of charge and consequently even in the meissner state there will be a non - uniform distribution in the sample . in a certain sense , this case can be viewed as a vortex turned inside out , i.e. with its core at infinity . in the presence of vortices",
