    "alternatively , one may formulate as a dirichlet problem on @xmath15 constrained by @xmath21 on @xmath14 and @xmath22 on @xmath23 , which leads to a saddle - point formulation , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "a first set of numerical algorithms relies on a triangulation of @xmath15 which is sufficiently aligned with the interface , i.e. @xmath14 is approximated by a polygon , the segments of which are edges ( or faces ) of the elements ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the construction of such a triangulation might be expensive or difficult in practice .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath25 depends on time , problems similar to need to be solved in each time step , and the triangulation has to be updated accordingly .",
    "in addition , one has to interpolate the data on the varying meshes in this case .",
    "therefore , a lot of research has been conducted to construct accurate methods employing meshes which are not aligned with @xmath14 but possess a `` simple '' structure and are fixed throughout the simulation ; see for instance the immersed boundary method @xcite , the immersed interface method @xcite , immersed finite elements @xcite , the fictitious domain method @xcite , the unfitted finite element method @xcite , the finite cell method @xcite , unfitted discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite , or composite finite elements @xcite , and the references provided there . in this work",
    "we will focus on a diffuse interface method for solving , see for instance @xcite . in this method the sharp interface condition @xmath21 on @xmath14",
    "is replaced by suitable conditions on @xmath26 on a diffuse layer centered around @xmath14 .",
    "similar techniques have also been applied for solving coupled bulk - surface differential equations @xcite or surface differential equations @xcite .",
    "the constraint @xmath21 on @xmath14 is equivalent to the condition @xmath27 . in order to relax this condition on the sharp interface , we define the signed distance function @xmath28 and we let @xmath29 be such that @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33",

    "this leads to the following approximation for integrals along the interface @xmath38 the reader might find a more detailed derivation of this approximation and other choices of @xmath39 in @xcite .",
    "we further notice that , to make this approximation well - defined , we need the function @xmath18 to be defined on the diffuse layer .",
    "if @xmath18 is defined on @xmath14 only , one has to use a suitable extension ; for instance a local extension is given by @xmath40 for @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 is constant off the interface .",
    "thus , replacing the sharp interface constraint by the diffuse interface constraint @xmath43 , which amounts to @xmath21 on @xmath44 , we are concerned with the following dirichlet problem : find @xmath45 such that @xmath46 note that the particular choice of @xmath47 is not important as long as @xmath37 is a @xmath34-tubular neighborhood of @xmath14 , i.e. methods using double obstacle potentials to regularize the indicator function of @xmath48 will essentially lead to the same method .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to estimate the errors introduced by this diffuse interface method ; ( i ) on the continuous level and ( ii ) in a finite dimensional setting when using the finite element method , see below .",
    "the first result in this direction is the following approximation result on the continuous level .",
