    "first published in 1929 , the wigner - von neumann method provides a way of embedding eigenvalues into the absolutely continuous spectrum of a one - dimensional schrdinger operator  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the operator is perturbed by a potential of the form @xmath3 causing the eigenvalue @xmath4 to become embedded in the interval @xmath5 of a.c . spectrum . since",
    "then the method has been adapted to embed multiple eigenvalues @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite using a single potential @xmath8 more recently , the technique has been employed on periodic schrdinger operators which have several or infinitely many bands of absolutely continuous spectrum  @xcite . in particular , the unperturbed operators have the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 for some period @xmath0 . note that another method based on the explicit solution of the inverse problem @xcite also allows to embed multiple ( but finitely many ) eigenvalues into the essential spectrum with a potential similar to the above .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the aforementioned ideas to the discrete analogue of jacobi operators , and produce a new technique for embedding a single eigenvalue into one of the bands of the periodic operator s essential spectrum .",
    "note that there already exist several other approaches for embedding eigenvalues into the essential spectrum of both schrdinger operators  @xcite and jacobi matrices  @xcite .",
    "however , the big advantage of the wigner - von neumann method is that it gives an explicit , and relatively simple , formula for the potential and eigenvector , even for the periodic case .",
    "a jacobi operator is defined to be a tri - diagonal infinite matrix which is considered as an operator on @xmath11 .",
    "we consider only real bounded hermitian jacobi operators and assume without loss of generality that the off - diagonal entries are positive .",
    "moreover , we assume the matrix to be @xmath0-periodic . then , our operator , @xmath12 , has the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 for all @xmath15 . from section  [ sec3 ]",
    "onwards we will assume for simplicity that @xmath16 for all @xmath15 .",
    "the method also works for more general cases with complex entries and non - zero diagonal , but we stick to the simple case to make our constructions more transparent .",
    "our goal is to make an ansatz for a possible eigenvector ( introduced in section 5 ) and an ansatz for the potential ( section 6 ) .",
    "we then establish the asymptotics of the potential needed to realize our ansatz .",
    "additionally , we must confirm that the subordinate solution constructed in this way also satisfies the initial equations encoded within the jacobi matrix ( section 7 ) , thus giving an embedded eigenvalue .",
    "section 2 contains some general results on @xmath0-periodic jacobi operators , while sections 3 contains some preliminary results for the construction . in section 4 we introduce the aforementioned function @xmath2 and analyze its properties , in particular that it is a rational function of @xmath1 .",
    "before we consider perturbations , it is best to state some results describing the structure of the spectrum of unperturbed @xmath0-periodic jacobi operators .",
    "it is not hard to see that the spectrum of a period-@xmath0 jacobi matrix , @xmath12 , is such that @xmath17.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the inclusion is sharp for period-@xmath18 and period-@xmath19 jacobi operators , which can easily be proved .",
    "moreover , the operator is self - adjoint and in the case of the vanishing diagonal its spectrum is symmetric w.r.t .",
    "the next elementary lemma gives information which will be useful in determining the entries of the monodromy matrix associated to @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 then , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real polynomials in @xmath1 of degree less than or equal to @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we use induction on @xmath32 , @xmath33 . for the base case of",
    "@xmath34 we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 immediately , they satisfy the hypothesis .",
    "now assume the result holds up to @xmath37 . to prove the result for @xmath38 , observe that by induction ,     @xmath39    [ per71 ] let @xmath40 be the monodromy matrix for an arbitrary period-@xmath0 operator , i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the transfer matrices given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 . then , @xmath46 and for all @xmath47 we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are real polynomials in @xmath1 of degree less than or equal to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "it is a classical fact ( see , for example , @xcite for schrdinger operators and @xcite for jacobi matrices ) that for @xmath53 , @xmath54 implies that @xmath1 lies in the absolutely continuous spectrum , @xmath55 , while if @xmath56 , then @xmath1 lies in the resolvent or the point spectrum : @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , we can canonically partition the points in the complex plane into three categories : hyperbolic , elliptic , parabolic .",
    "[ genint ] the hyperbolic points are those @xmath58 that produce a monodromy matrix with two eigenvalues , @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; elliptic points those that produce two distinct eigenvalues of modulus one ; and parabolic points those that produce one eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity two , i.e. @xmath62 . moreover , we define the generalised interior of the essential spectrum , denoted @xmath63 , to be the set of elliptic points .    for @xmath53 we can distinguish the hyperbolic , elliptic and parabolic cases by @xmath64 all points in @xmath65 for an arbitrary @xmath0-periodic jacobi operator belong to the hyperbolic region . in particular , all parabolic ( and elliptic ) points are real .",
    "let @xmath66 and consider the weyl vector , @xmath67 , defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "obviously , this weyl vector belongs to @xmath70 and therefore its components are decaying .",
    "if @xmath1 belongs to either the elliptic or parabolic regions then trivial analysis of the powers of the monodromy matrix leads to the fact that no solution of the recurrence relation @xmath71 decays . therefore all non - real @xmath1 are hyperbolic points",
    ".    the following result will not surprise specialists in the area , but to the best of our knowledge there is no proof in the literature .",
    "of course , it is a folklore - type result .",
    "we consider a family of period-@xmath0 jacobi operators @xmath72 depending on the two parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "then there exists an open dense set @xmath75 in @xmath76 such that for all @xmath77 the essential spectrum of @xmath78 consists of @xmath0 distinct real intervals",
    ".    we will refer to the situation that @xmath79 consists of @xmath0 distinct real intervals as the non - degenerate case .",
    "the proof will consist of two parts : we show that non - degeneracy is stable under small perturbations , while on the other hand the degenerate case is not stable .",
    "we initially introduce some notation .",
    "define the transfer matrices for @xmath78 as @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 let @xmath83 be the monodromy matrix for @xmath84 , i.e.  @xmath85 , and @xmath86 the monodromy matrix for @xmath78 , i.e.   @xmath87    by corollary  [ per71 ] we have @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are real polynomials in @xmath1 of order @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath0 respectively . then , as @xmath93 are two polynomials each of degree @xmath0 in @xmath1 , there are at most @xmath94 real zeros of these functions , providing at most @xmath0 intervals of a.c . spectrum .",
    "recall from lemma  [ 4.20 ] that all of the parabolic points for @xmath12 are real .",
    "it needs to be shown that if @xmath84 is non - degenerate , then adding sufficiently small @xmath95 to the operator does not cause two previously distinct parabolic points to overlap .",
    "the argument is simple : for each pair of distinct parabolic points @xmath96 of @xmath84 there exists @xmath97 such that for the corresponding parabolic points of @xmath78 we have @xmath98 for @xmath99 , using the fact that the roots of a polynomial depend continuously on its coefficients .",
    "( see , for example , appendix a in @xcite . )",
    "then , since there are at most @xmath94 parabolic points in total , we can define @xmath100 which implies @xmath101 for all @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "this shows that the non - degenerate case is stable .",
    "we now show that the case where two of the intervals of essential spectrum of @xmath84 overlap is unstable .",
    "let @xmath104 be a parabolic point for @xmath84 .",
    "we will only consider the case when @xmath105 , the case @xmath106 can be dealt with similarly .",
    "assume that @xmath107 .",
    "then @xmath108 , otherwise @xmath109 would change sign at @xmath104 and @xmath104 would separate the elliptic and hyperbolic regions , implying @xmath110 .    we now show that in most cases a diagonal perturbation is sufficient to split the overlapping intervals .",
    "assume that @xmath111 let @xmath1 ( depending on @xmath73 ) be a degenerate parabolic point for some @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 our objective is to show that this can not happen for sufficiently small @xmath114 and @xmath73 .",
    "due to continuous dependence of the roots on the small parameter @xmath73 , there is no need to consider the case @xmath115 .",
    "also , will hold ( for the same polynomial @xmath116 from @xmath83 ) with @xmath104 replaced by @xmath1 in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath104 .",
    "noting that @xmath117 is independent of @xmath73 we get that @xmath118 as @xmath119 we get    @xmath120    now , equations   and combine to give the new conditions @xmath121 and @xmath122    if equations   and are both satisfied then we obtain    @xmath123    by invoking corollary  [ per71 ] we observe that the product of polynomials on the left hand side equals @xmath124 note that the term @xmath125 is a polynomial of degree not greater than @xmath126 , the rational function @xmath127 is of order @xmath128 , and the term @xmath129 is a polynomial of degree @xmath130 . combining these observations we have that the entire last term of the expression is a polynomial of degree @xmath130 .",
    "since @xmath130 is greater than @xmath126 the whole expression is of degree @xmath130 .",
    "clearly , this is not identically zero .",
    "furthermore , this means there are at most @xmath131 roots , say @xmath132 which are independent of @xmath73 .",
    "then , since under our assumptions @xmath133 , we calculate the valid values for @xmath73 by substituting @xmath134 into either equation   or , and , so , there are at most @xmath131 valid values for @xmath73 . in particular , for any sufficiently small @xmath135 , the value @xmath1 can not be a degenerate parabolic point for @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , all degenerate parabolic points satisfying will be split into non - degenerate points for @xmath136 sufficiently small .",
    "it remains to deal with the exceptional case @xmath137 . in this case",
    ", we use a perturbation with @xmath138 , @xmath139 . note that since @xmath105 and @xmath140 , we have that @xmath141 implies @xmath142 then @xmath143 and using we get @xmath144 evaluating at @xmath104",
    ", we get @xmath145 for all @xmath146 so @xmath104 is a hyperbolic point for @xmath147 for @xmath139 .",
    "choosing @xmath148 sufficiently small such that no non - degenerate parabolic points can degenerate ( see step one ) , this implies that the total degeneracy of the roots at must have decreased by at least one .    repeating the procedure finitely many times",
    ", we can ensure that all roots of @xmath149 are simple for sufficiently small non - zero @xmath150 .",
    "note that in each step , @xmath73 or @xmath74 may be chosen arbitrarily small . since the set of non - degenerate points is open by step 1",
    ", the set of points @xmath150 is an open dense set .    as a consequence of the above",
    ", we obtain the following theorem .    for almost all choices of parameters @xmath151 the essential spectrum ( which equals the absolutely continuous spectrum ) of the associated hermitian @xmath0-periodic jacobi matrix consists of @xmath0 distinct real intervals .",
