    "<S> for a narrow band of values of the top quark and higgs boson masses , the standard model higgs potential develops a false minimum at energies of about @xmath0 gev , where primordial inflation could have started in a cold metastable state . a graceful exit to a radiation - dominated era </S>",
    "<S> is provided , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , by scalar - tensor gravity models . </S>",
    "<S> we pointed out that if inflation happened in this false minimum , the higgs boson mass has to be in the range @xmath1 gev , where atlas and cms subsequently reported excesses of events . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that for these values of the higgs boson mass , the inflationary gravitational wave background has be discovered with a tensor - to - scalar ratio at hand of future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that combining cosmological observations with measurements of the top quark and higgs boson masses represents a further test of the hypothesis that the standard model false minimum was the source of inflation in the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that , for a narrow band of values of the top quark and higgs boson masses , the standard model ( sm ) higgs potential develops a local minimum @xcite is nontrivial by itself , but it is even more suggestive that this happens at energy scales of about @xmath0 gev , suitable for inflation in the early universe .    inflation from a local minimum is a viable scenario , provided a _ graceful exit _ to a radiation - dominated era can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> developing an explicit model with graceful exit in the framework of a scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite , in ref.@xcite we pointed out that the hypothesis that inflation took place in the sm false vacuum is consistent only with a narrow range of values of the higgs boson mass , @xmath2 gev , the error being mainly due to the theoretical uncertainty of the 2-loops renormalization group equations ( rge ) used in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this mass range is surprisingly compatible with the window @xmath3 gev , were both atlas and cms @xcite recently reported excesses of events , in the di - photon as well as the 4-lepton higgs decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> it is also compatible with preliminary results from tevatron @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these preliminary but very suggestive results provide a strong motivation to further investigate the scenario of sm false vacuum inflation , in particular by looking for complementary experimental tests . </S>",
    "<S> inflation can generate tensor ( gravity wave ) modes as well as scalar ( density perturbation ) modes . </S>",
    "<S> it is most common to define the tensor contribution through @xmath4 , the ratio of tensor - to - scalar perturbation spectra at large scales . if inflation happened at a very high scale , as is the case for the sm false vacuum scenario , quantum fluctuations during inflation produced a background of gravitational waves with a relatively large amplitude .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the tensor - to - scalar ratio , combined with the top quark and higgs boson mass measurements , does represent a test of the hypothesis that inflation started from the sm false vacuum .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the higgs potential in the sm of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> for very large values of the higgs field @xmath5 , the quadratic term @xmath6 can be neglected and we are left with the quartic term , whose dimensionless coupling @xmath7 depends on the energy scale , which can be identified with the field @xmath5 itself : @xmath8 it is well known that , for some narrow band of the higgs and top masses , the higgs potential develops a new local minimum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs field is trapped in a cold coherent state in the false minimum @xmath9 and dominates the energy density of the universe , the standard friedmann equation leads to a stage of inflationary expansion h^2 h_i^2 , a(t)e^h_i t [ eq - m ] where @xmath10 is the scale factor , @xmath11 is the hubble rate and @xmath12 is the planck mass .    </S>",
    "<S> a nontrivial model - dependent ingredient is how to achieve a graceful exit from inflation , that is a transition to a radiation - dominated era , in a nearly flat universe at a sufficiently high - temperature . in order to end inflation </S>",
    "<S> the higgs field has to tunnel to the other side of the potential barrier by nucleating bubbles  @xcite that eventually collide and percolate . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently the higgs field could roll down the potential , reheat the universe and finally relax in the present true vacuum with @xmath13 gev . whether the tunneling event happens depends on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the nucleation rate per unit time and volume .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath16 , the universe tunnels quickly in a few hubble times , without providing sufficient inflation . if @xmath17 , the tunneling probability is so small that the process does not produce a sufficient number of bubbles inside a hubble horizon that could percolate . </S>",
    "<S> a graceful exit would thus require @xmath18 to become larger than @xmath19 only after some time , but this is impossible if both quantities are time - independent , as is the case for the pure sm embedded in standard gravity  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a time - dependent @xmath18 necessarily requires the existence of an additional time - dependent order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this can be realized in a scalar - tensor theory of gravity , where the value of the planck mass is set by a scalar field @xmath20 , the brans - dicke scalar or dilaton . </S>",
    "<S> this allows coupling @xmath20 to the ricci scalar @xmath21 via an interaction of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 thus sets the value of the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such field makes the planck mass time - dependent , and therefore also @xmath14 , naturally leading to an increase in @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> this has been shown in early models  @xcite achieving power - law inflation , which later turned out to be in tension with observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , since it is difficult to get a nearly flat spectrum of perturbations  @xcite . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a stage of exponential expansion was naturally incorporated , later followed by a stage of power - law ( even decelerated ) expansion . in this way , it is possible to produce a flat nearly homogenous universe during the exponential phase and , moreover , the quantum fluctuations in @xmath20 lead to the correct spectrum of perturbations . during the subsequent decelerated phase , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 decreases rapidly , allowing the field trapped in the false minimum to tunnel through percolation of bubbles . as discussed in @xcite , after tunneling we require the field @xmath20 to relax to zero , which allows us to identify the present planck mass @xmath24 @xmath25 gev with the planck mass at inflation @xmath12 and , at the same time , to satisfy constraints from fifth - force experiments and time - dependence of the newton constant @xmath26 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to scalar - tensor theories is given by models @xcite with a direct coupling of the higgs field to an additional scalar field , which induces a time - dependence directly into @xmath15 by flattening the barrier in the potential or it might be possible to achieve a graceful exit in other models with an additional coupling of the higgs field to @xmath21 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial to notice that a graceful exit can be generically realized only if at the end of inflation there is a very shallow false minimum , otherwise the tunneling rate would be negligibly small , since the probability is exponentially sensitive to the barrier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , the shape of the potential is very close to the case in which there is just an inflection point . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a powerful generic prediction is the one at @xmath27 e - folds before the end . in models in which the potential is time - independent as the ones in @xcite we necessarily have a shallow false minimum . </S>",
    "<S> models with time - dependent @xmath15 can also be constructed , but even in those models it is likely that @xmath28 e - folds before the end of inflation the potential well is generically not deep , since a too rapid variation of the potential in the last stages of inflation would probably be in conflict with observations of the spectral index , as in @xcite . ] for the scale of inflation and therefore for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> so , if the false vacuum is very shallow , the specific model only affects the prediction for the spectral index of cosmological density perturbations @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for a wide class of functions @xmath30 the models considered in @xcite lead to @xmath31 , in agreement with the central value subsequently measured by wmap @xcite .    using 2-loop rge and matching conditions , we studied the very specific values of the top and higgs masses allowing for the presence of a false minimum . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , in fig.[fig - vmin ] we display the higgs potential for very specific values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the extremely precise values shown in the caption are not to be taken sharply , because of a theoretical uncertainty of about @xmath34 gev on @xmath33 and about @xmath19 gev on @xmath32 , which is intrinsic in the 2-loop rge procedure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above and discussed in @xcite , in order to have a sizable tunneling probability through the left side , the barrier must be very low , as is the case for the middle curve . for slightly smaller values of @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> the second minimum becomes deeper and the tunneling probability essentially zero the potential turns negative , so that the sm minimum at low energy becomes metastable @xcite . ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> we fixed @xmath35 , @xmath36 gev and , from top to bottom , @xmath37 gev . in order to have a non - negligible tunneling probability @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> should be determined with 15 significative digits , as we checked by numerically evaluating a bounce @xcite solution.,width=253 ]    .2 cm    increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath32 , one has also to increase ( decrease ) @xmath33 in order to develop the shallow false minimum ; accordingly , the value of both @xmath38 and @xmath9 increase ( decrease ) . the solid line in fig.[fig - mtmh ] </S>",
    "<S> shows the points in the @xmath39 plane where the shallow sm false minima exists . </S>",
    "<S> we recall however that the line has a ( vertical ) uncertainty of @xmath19 gev in @xmath32 and a ( horizontal ) one of @xmath34 gev in @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the shallow false minima are just at the right of the dashed line marking the transition from stability to metastability . </S>",
    "<S> ticks along the solid line display the associated values of @xmath40 in units of gev .        </S>",
    "<S> .22 cm    the measurement of @xmath32 implies the lower bounds @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 gev , considering the theoretical errors intrinsic in the rge . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> as it is well - known and explained below , the scale of inflation can not be too high , @xmath43 gev , which leads to the constraint @xmath44 gev . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the allowed band for sm false vacuum inflation includes the region @xmath3 gev , where atlas and cms @xcite recorded excesses of events in the di - photon as well as 4-leptons channels . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , now cms has set the upper bound @xmath45 gev at @xmath46 cl , which further restricts the allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> this striking coincidence of values deserves further exploration both experimentally , by reducing the error on @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and theoretically by improving the rge . </S>",
    "<S> if unification of gauge couplings is realized in nature , the modification is however probably constrained to be small . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant source of the uncertainty in the rge at present arises from the matching of the quartic higgs coupling , known only at 1-loop . by varying the matching scale from about @xmath47 gev ( close to @xmath33 ) and about @xmath48 gev ( close to @xmath32 ) one finds that the value of @xmath33 leading to a shallow false minimum at the gut scale changes by @xmath19 gev . clearly the range of where to vary the matching scale is somewhat arbitrary , and in the literature one can find different choices . as in many other papers </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using the same accuracy for the rge as ours , we considered it conservative to assign an error of @xmath34 gev on @xmath33 , and an error of @xmath19 gev on @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this might overestimate the theoretical error , but in order to better understand it , one would need to know the 2-loop correction to the matching of the quartic higgs coupling . </S>",
    "<S> reasonably , one could expect that in this way the theoretical error on @xmath33 could be reduced down to @xmath19 gev , which is comparable to the experimental precision on @xmath33 foreseen at lhc . by varying @xmath33 within a range of @xmath19 gev </S>",
    "<S> , one obtains in our scenario a prediction for @xmath32 within a range of about @xmath49 gev , call it @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental precision on @xmath32 needed to falsify our scenario depends on the difference between @xmath50 and the experimental central value of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller this difference is , the more precision is needed on @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> a complementary way of testing the possibility that inflation started from the sm false vacuum at high energy is to look at the tensor - to - scalar ratio of cosmological perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of density fluctuations in the observed universe as seen by the cmb and large - scale structure data is parametrized by the power spectrum in @xmath51-space p_s(k)=_r^2 ( ) ^n_s-1 , where @xmath52 is the amplitude at some pivot point @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the best - fit value from @xcite , @xmath54 at @xmath55 .    in any inflationary model that can be analyzed through the slow - roll approximation @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , there is a relationship between the scale of inflation , the amplitude of density perturbations , and the amount of gravity waves that can be produced : _ </S>",
    "<S> r^2 = . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq - r ] if inflation actually started from a sm shallow false minimum , then each point in the @xmath39 plane has to be associated with a specific value of @xmath4 , as shown in fig.[fig - mtmh ] via the lower row of ticks . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit on @xmath4 is at present about @xmath56 @xcite , which gives rise to the above mentioned upper bound @xmath57 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound on @xmath32 instead implies @xmath58 , partially at hand of future experimental sensitivity for various experiments such as planck @xcite , epic @xcite and core @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> improving the top quark mass measurement and/or discovering the higgs mass close to @xmath59 gev could further constrain @xmath4 from below .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between @xmath4 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is completely general in any model with a sm shallow false vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> as we have mentioned , it is conceivable that models could be constructed in which the false vacuum initially is not shallow , but somehow the higgs potential becomes time - dependent and is lifted up , making @xmath15 large and leading inflation to an end . in such models only at the end of inflation the final shape of the potential </S>",
    "<S> is given by the sm higgs potential with a shallow minimum . </S>",
    "<S> in this case we can make two important statements . </S>",
    "<S> first , the height of the minimum during the observationally relevant stage of inflation ( _ i.e. _ @xmath27 e - folds before the end ) is always at most as high as the one in the shallow case : as a consequence , our prediction on @xmath4 always applies strictly as an upper bound for any model which uses the higgs false minimum to source inflation . </S>",
    "<S> so , if future experiments will measure @xmath32 and @xmath33 accurately and if the rge theoretical error is reduced , measuring @xmath4 above the corresponding value displayed in fig.[fig - mtmh ] would rule out all such models . </S>",
    "<S> second , even in the case of a time - dependent higgs potential , it is very likely that at @xmath27 e - folds before the end of inflation the barrier is still close to the shallow case , so fig.[fig - mtmh ] would probably apply even in such models .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , we argue that precision measurements of @xmath4 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , together with theoretical improvements of the sm rge , will represent a test of the hypothesis @xcite that inflation occurred in the sm false vacuum at about @xmath0 gev . </S>"
