    "traditionally , effects of pauli paramagnetism on superconductors with a spin - singlet cooper - pairing have been discussed by simply focusing on two energy scales @xcite ; the superconducting ( sc ) condensation energy and the zeeman energy preventing the singlet pairing .",
    "this is a reasonable explanation on the first order transition ( fot ) in an exceptional case with no orbital depairing creating field - induced vortices , i.e. , a thin - film superconductor in parallel fields @xcite .",
    "further , there is also a possibility of a structural transition _ within _ the meissner phase into the so - called fflo state @xcite with a periodic modulation , induced by the spin ( paramagnetic ) depairing , of the sc order parameter .",
    "however , the orbital depairing effects , i.e. , the field - induced vortices , are inevitably present in most of cases of a bulk type ii superconductor under a strong field , including a layered material under a field parallel to the superconducting layers @xcite .",
    "hence , we encounter quite a _ different _ issue from that in the works @xcite , that is , effects of the spin depairing on the _ vortex state _ which has _ no _ meissner response . since the number of vortices is determined only by the magnetic field strength and system sizes , treating the orbital depairing as a perturbation for the case with no orbital depairing",
    "is not valid .    at present , it is well understood @xcite that , in lower fields where the spin depairing is negligible , the @xmath6-@xmath7 phase diagram for the vortex states is _ drastically _ changed by including the sc fluctuation neglected in the mean field ( mf ) approximation .",
    "a typical one among such drastic fluctuation effects is the fact that the second order mf transition at @xmath1 is not realized as a consequence of the fluctuation and gives way to a _ weak _ first order transition lying below @xmath1 between the vortex solid and the vortex liquid region which needs not be distinguished from the normal state .",
    "at least theoretically , it is important to extend this issue to the strong field region in which the spin depairing is not negligible and the mf transition at @xmath1 may be discontinuous .    through previous mf works on the vortex states of superconductors with paramagnetic depairing @xcite , however , one notices that even the @xmath6-@xmath7 phase diagram in the mf approximation is an unsettled issue .",
    "for instance , a fot induced by the spin depairing was expected through a calculation in dirty limit @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , contrary to the experimental facts .",
    "further , even in pure ( clean ) limit , there are no consensus on the mf phase diagram . in strong fields of our interest ,",
    "any meissner phase ( i.e. , any phase occurring with no orbital depairing ) is not possible , and we expect just some vortex solids , such as the ordinary solid consisting of straight vortex lines and an , if any , fflo - like solid state with a periodic modulation along the applied field , as sc ground states in clean limit with no defects leading to a vortex - pinning .",
    "let us call a transition curve between the above - mentioned two vortex solid states as @xmath2 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the transition at @xmath8 was argued to be of first order with no detailed calculation , while it was obtained as a second order one in ref.@xcite where the orbital depairing represented by the gauge - invariant gradient is treated perturbatively .",
    "further , the temperature @xmath9 at which the mf transition at @xmath1 changes into a discontinuous one was concluded there @xcite to lie much below another temperature @xmath10 at which @xmath2 and @xmath3 branch .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2-line is often suggested to be insensitive to @xmath7 .",
    "we note that all of conflicting results raised above were obtained in the same model , i.e. , the simplest weak - coupling bcs model .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the sc phase diagram of quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconductors with a singlet @xmath11-wave pairing under a high field perpendicular to the sc layers where both the orbital- and spin - depairings are not negligible . in sec.ii , a mf calculation for the weak - coupling bcs model",
    "is first performed by focusing primarily on the region where the sc order parameter is described within the lowest landau level ( lll or @xmath12 ll ) .",
    "we demonstrate by treating the two depairing effects on the same footing that most of the previous mf results mentioned above may be significantly changed .",
    "our analysis is different from that in ref.@xcite in that the gauge - invariant gradient is fully incorporated .",
    "this nonperturbative inclusion of the orbital depairing should become important upon cooling and with increasing field , although , instead , multiple numerical integrals have to be performed to accomplish it .",
    "further , bearing a comparison with data in real systems in mind , a weak impurity scattering should be incorporated because the @xmath2 line which may appear in high @xmath6 and low @xmath7 is found to be quite sensitive to the impurity strength .",
    "consequently , the mf phase diagram is determined by a competition among the two depairing effects and the impurity strength .",
    "we find that the temperature @xmath9 always lies above other two characteristic temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath13 below which the vortex solid will be described by the next lowest landau level ( @xmath14 ll ) .",
    "in addition to these studies of the mf phase diagram , linear response and elastic properties in a possible helical fflo - like vortex solid will be examined to give a result useful for search of such a helical solid state .",
    "next , in sec.iii , we address effects of the sc fluctuation on the phase diagram by neglecting vortex pinning effects .",
    "we notice that a theoretical consideration on the fluctuation effects on the orderings in vortex states below @xmath1 is unaffected by a change of the gl model brought by the presence of the spin depairing and naturally leads to the conjecture that the fot obtained in the mf approximation ( mf - fot ) at @xmath1 will not occur as a true fot in real systems .",
    "actually , otherwise , the high field portion of the @xmath6-@xmath7 phase diagram would not become compatible with its low field portion in which the absence of the second order mf transition at @xmath1 is well - established  @xcite .",
    "the only transition in the case with no pinning disorder should be the melting transition of a vortex solid . in the present case with a mf - fot",
    ", however , the gl model needs to have higher order ( nonlinear ) terms other than the quartic term , and this fact makes an analytic study more involved .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to perform monte carlo simulations on a gl model justified through our microscopic analysis in order to examine the true phase diagram .",
    "our simulation results are consistent with the above - mentioned conjecture that the mf - fot at @xmath1 is changed due to the fluctuation into a crossover of which the width is narrower in systems with weaker fluctuation .",
    "together with the impurity - induced disappearance of the mf - fot , this fluctuation - induced broadening of the sharp behavior reflecting the mf - fot explains why the nearly discontinuous behavior at @xmath1 has not been observed so far in , except the recent observations in cecoin@xmath5 @xcite , most of bulk type ii superconductors with a spin - singlet pairing . on the other hand , we find that , in spite of the absence of the genuine fot at @xmath1 , a hysteresis may appear near @xmath1 in simulations for cases with weaker fluctuation ( or equivalently , at very low temperatures ) as a result of an incomplete relaxation at finite time scales .    finally in sec.iv , experimental facts in cecoin@xmath5 under @xmath15 and other materials are discussed based on the results obtained in sec.ii and iii .",
    "it is conjectured there that the sc fluctuation makes the @xmath2-line and the fot - like behavior at @xmath1 unobservable in strongly fluctuating systems such as organic materials .",
    "further , it is also pointed out there that , although microscopic results in sec.ii are not applicable to the @xmath16 case in cecoin@xmath5 , recent specific heat data @xcite can be understood within our results in sec.iii .",
    "we use the unit @xmath17 throughout the manuscript .",

    "where @xmath242 ( @xmath243 ) , the @xmath3 line and hence , the vortex lattice itself just below it are determined by the next lowest ( @xmath14 ) ll . according to the @xmath244-curve in fig.[fig : an ] , this @xmath14 state is not a modulated fflo - like state but a straight vortex solid .",
    "further , note that @xmath13 and @xmath10 are close to each other ( see fig.[fig : hc2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "these results imply that , in quasi 2d materials under fields perpendicular to the sc layers , the presence itself of the fflo - like vortex solid is very subtle even in pure limit .",
    "thus , a competition between the fflo - like solid within lll and a solid within the @xmath14 ll has to be examined just above the @xmath2 line .",
    "since this is an issue of a transition between vortex lattice structures defined within the planes perpendicular to the field , a detailed description of the stable vortex lattices in @xmath11-wave pairing cases is required to address this .",
    "as already mentioned , however , the nonlocality , at least , of the sixth order gl term affecting the in - place lattice structure was neglected in this paper .",

    "above occurs in the case with no orbital depairing in an isotropic 3d system ( see eq.(31 ) in ref.@xcite ) .",

    "next , let us briefly discuss the vortex elastic energy .",
    "the shear elastic energy for in - plane shear distortions is obtained , as in the case of straight vortex lattice , from the phase fluctuation energy .",
    "it was already shown in ref.@xcite that the _ quartic _ dispersion on the 2d wave vector @xmath283 of the massless phase fluctuation and hence , the way of identifying the shear elastic mode with the phase fluctuation are unaffected by any change of the higher order terms of the gl model .",
    "no calculation of shear modulus will not be performed here , and we simply assume , just for qualitative consideration , the resulting shear energy term to be positive definite .",
    "in contrast , some comment will be necessary on the tilt energy which should change through @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    ", we focus on its expression in type ii limit with no internal gauge fluctuation @xcite . according to eq.([fgrad2 ] ) , the tilt energy in type ii limit takes the form @xmath284 where @xmath285 , and the relation @xcite @xmath286 between the transverse displacement @xmath287 and the phase fluctuation was used . on the other hand , in the straight vortex solid ( i.e. , in @xmath288 ) where @xmath289 , the dispersion @xmath290 in eq.([tilt ] ) is replaced by @xmath291 .",
    "thus , the macroscopic properties in both the vortex solids are qualitatively the same as each other",
    ".    however , the tilt rigidity decreases with approaching @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath292 dependence of the tilt modulus just on @xmath2 implies a _",
    "short_-ranged phase coherence of the vortex solid there which is consistent with the vanishing superfluid rigidity on @xmath2 . because this absence of sc order in the _ critical _ vortex solid ( i.e. , the case just on @xmath2 ) is due to a softening ( or weakening ) of an elastic modulus , an enhanced peak effect due to an increase of the critical current is expected near @xmath2 , as well as the ordinary one near @xmath3 @xcite , in real materials with random pinning effects .",
    "this conjecture may be useful for searching a transition curve to the fflo - like vortex solid .",
    "in this section , the real phase diagram of systems described by eq.([floc ] ) is studied by including the fluctuation effects .",

    "although we have not extended our simulation work to ( if any ) the range @xmath216 defined within the lowest ll , fluctuation effects similar to those in @xmath296 should be also expected in such higher fields ( see below ) .",

    "like in the familiar case @xcite with a second order mf transition at @xmath1 , let us start from a description deep in the ordered phase .",
    "first , since an inclusion of the orbital depairing requires the presence of field - induced vortices , a low energy excitation in the ordered phase is inevitably an elastic mode of a vortex solid .",
    "as already noted in the final part of sec.ii , it is clear that the form of the elastic energy and the relation between the phase fluctuation and the vortex displacement @xcite are essentially unaffected by differences in the forms of higher order gl terms .",
    "then , it is clear from the previous works @xcite that the phase fluctuation is marginally relevant even in 3d case , and that the rigidity controlling the _ quasi _ long - ranged phase coherence in the vortex solid is the shear modulus.@xcite that is , if the vortex solid is melted at @xmath316 below @xmath1 , we have only short - ranged orders for both the phase and the vortex position in the vortex liquid above @xmath316 with no finite shear modulus , and thus , the vortex liquid should be continuously connected with the normal phase above @xmath1 @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the mf - fot at @xmath1 should not occur .",
    "further , to understand this from another point of view , let us note that the quasi 2d sc order parameter in the lowest ll has the form  @xcite @xmath317 where @xmath318 , @xmath319 , @xmath320 is the complex coordinate perpendicular to @xmath258 of the @xmath153-th vortex , and a landau gauge was assumed for the external gauge field . since the vortex positions are highly disordered above @xmath316 , the fluctuation effect above @xmath316 is essentially described only by the amplitude @xmath321 .",
    "however , @xmath321 depends only on @xmath249 _ irrespective of _ the form of the higher order gl terms .",

    "once noting that the @xmath269-form of the tilt elastic term in @xmath296 is replaced in @xmath216 by @xmath322 , the above argument precluding a genuine fot at @xmath1 can be applied to such higher fields with no modification .",
    "note also that the continuous transition at @xmath8 is a _",
    "structural _ transition between the ordered vortex solids and hence , together with fflo - like states themselves , will not be lost due to the sc fluctuation _ as far as _ @xmath323 ( see sec .",
    "the theoretical discussion given above implies that , as far as @xmath324 , a genuine transition at @xmath1 can not occur .",
    "then , it is at least natural to expect that , following the familiar case in @xmath325 with a second order @xmath1-transition , @xmath324 at any nonzero @xmath7 and hence that , as in fig.[fig : phasedg ] ( a ) , a genuine transition at @xmath1 never occurs at _ any _ nonzero temperature",

    "of course , there will be no possibility that the actual @xmath316 lies above @xmath1 .",

    "as shown and mentioned in sec.iii , the absence of a true fot at @xmath1 should be an appropriate interpretation for observations @xcite at least in @xmath15 where no measurable hysteresis was observed although the ordinary magnetic hysteresis related to the peak effect near @xmath1 @xcite might appear .",
    "on the other hand , observations of a tiny hysteresis were recently reported in specific heat data @xcite and also in magnetization data @xcite of cecoin@xmath5 in @xmath16 . examining _",
    "microscopic _ aspects in @xmath16 leading to a mf phase diagram is beyond the scope of the present paper and will not be considered here .",
    "however , the issue of the genuine phase diagram in sec.iii is more generic and may be applicable to the @xmath16 case in cecoin@xmath5 . because the fluctuation effect in @xmath16 is weaker than that in @xmath15 at the same @xmath7 , the observed hysteresis in refs.@xcite can be understood within the present theory arguing the absence of a genuine fot at @xmath1 , if it has the same origin as a hysteresis in numerical simulations at _ low enough _ @xmath7 , shown in figs.[fig:3d_hys ] and [ fig:1dgl ] , which arises from an _ incomplete _ relaxation at long but finite time scales in a system with a strong mf - fot . in relation to this , we point out that the onset of hysteresis in ref.@xcite lies slightly _ above _ the temperature @xmath10 at which @xmath2 branches from the mf - fot ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) line .",
    "it implies that the onset of hysteresis has nothing to do with the appearance of the fflo - like state and thus that there is no physical reason favoring a termination of some genuine sc ( superconducting ) fot .",
    "alternatively , the observed hysteresis might accompany a true _",
    "magnetic _ fot induced by the @xmath396 -nucreation at @xmath1 as a consequence of a coupling between the sc and a magnetic order parameters . in relation to this , we point out the observation of a large magnetic hysteresis @xcite in @xmath16 just below @xmath1 to which the corresponding one was not seen in the vanishing of resistivity ( i.e. , a sc ordering ) .",
    "finally , let us point out that the present theory easily explains why , in fields parallel to the layers , the transition to an fflo - like phase and the nearly discontinuous crossover at @xmath1 implying the mf - fot were measured not in organic materials with larger anisotropy but in a heavy fermion material with weaker anisotropy . at least at the mf level ,",
    "the case with a field parallel to the layers in more anisotropic materials is subject to a stronger paramagnetic depairing and is the best candidate for observing the paramagnetic effects such as the fflo - like state and the mf - fot .",
    "the organic materials satisfy this requirement , and actually , the upwardly increasing @xmath3 curve determined resistiviely @xcite under high fields parallel to the layers is an evidence @xcite that the spin depairing is microscopically important without being disturbing by an impurity effect .",
    "however , both the mf - fot and a transition to an fflo - like state have not been seen in the organic materials . on the other hand , since such a upward @xmath3-curve is not visible in the heavy fermion material cecoin@xmath5 with a much weaker anisotropy , one might wonder why these crossover and transition arising from the spin depairing have occurred in this material .",
    "this puzzling facts are easily resolved by taking account of fluctuation effects examined in this paper .",
    "typically , in the organic and cuprate materials @xcite , the fluctuation effect is much stronger compared with those of cecoin@xmath5 .",
    "actually , a shorter coherence length tends to result in a larger maki parameter and simultaneously to enhance the fluctuation even in the parallel field case @xcite . consequently ,",
    "as shown in sec.iii , the mf - fot behavior is rounded and is transmuted into a broad continuous crossover by the sc fluctuation , reflecting the absence of the true fot at @xmath1 .",
    "further , a remarkable field and temperature range of the vortex liquid region in which the resistance is finite may be created below @xmath3-curve even in the parallel field case @xcite where the fluctuation effect is minimized . since the fflo - like state is limited to a narrow field range below @xmath1 , and the modulation parallel to the field does not lead to any ordering in the vortex liquid , the vortex liquid region should mask and erase the fflo - like phase in a strongly fluctuating superconductor . for these reasons , cleaner superconducting materials with _",
    "weaker _ fluctuation such as cecoin@xmath5 are the best candidates for examining the mf high field phase diagram in the case with pauli paramagnetic effects .",
