    "<S> this is the central result of this letter .    _ </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity_.ignoring technical noise and assuming that the final optical detector is well characterized and has near unit quantum efficiency , we concentrate on the intrinsic sensitivity of the three - step conversion sequence . it is characterized primarily by the microwave - to - optical conversion efficiency , the effects of quantum and thermal noise , and the dead time required to reset the resonators between measurements . </S>",
    "<S> perfect adiabatic conversion requires interaction times @xmath138 , and the dead time to reset the resonators is of the order of @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> quantum and thermal noise result in a dark - count rate that also impacts the figure of merit of the detector ; see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : nout ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a high-@xmath140 and ultracold mechanical oscillator can significantly suppress these sources of noise .    </S>",
    "<S> as an example we consider an optomechanical resonator with high mechanical frequency @xmath141ghz and quality factor @xmath142 , which results in @xmath143 khz and @xmath144 for a temperature @xmath145k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of the large detunings considered here , we find , however , that the mechanical noise only adds a contribution of @xmath146 to @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> the level of thermal microwave noise that feeds into @xmath148 can be managed by cooling the microwave cavity to cryogenic temperatures . for a microwave cavity frequency @xmath149 </S>",
    "<S> ghz and temperature @xmath150 k , we have @xmath151 , but for @xmath152 k , @xmath153 is reduced to @xmath154 . finally , we assume linear optomechanical coupling strengths @xmath155 mhz and @xmath156 mhz , respectively , giving an effective interaction strength @xmath157 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> we also set the same decay rate for both cavities , @xmath158 khz . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters fulfill the condition for adiabaticity of the conversion and result in a dead time of the order of @xmath159  ns . </S>",
    "<S> these estimates indicate that the detector should be able to operate reliably at or below the single - photon level .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion_.we have proposed and analyzed a time - gated microwave detection scheme based on the control of polaritons in a hybrid optomechanical system . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to resonant schemes that focus on high fidelity quantum state transfer @xcite , the dual optomechanical cavity detector is driven by a heterodynelike pumping and operates on the far - off sideband resonant regime to minimize pump and mechanical noise , thereby offering the potential to reliably detect very feeble microwave fields . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , that nonresonant approach does not preserve the quantum state of the microwave field . </S>",
    "<S> rather , it detects the signal entering the microwave resonator in a time determined by its decay time @xmath160 just before transfer to the optical domain .    </S>",
