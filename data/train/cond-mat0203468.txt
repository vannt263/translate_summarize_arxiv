    "the quadrupolar vibrational modes of silver or gold nanoparticles embedded in dielectric matrices are easily observable by low - frequency raman scattering ( lfrs ) because of the enhancement effect when the light excitation is resonant with the dipolar surface plasmon excitation @xcite .",
    "this enhancement will be referred to as `` resonant raman scattering '' throughout the paper . for silver particles the absorption by the dipolar plasmon excitation",
    "is exhausted by the conduction electrons , and is well separated from the absorption corresponding to the interband transitions .",
    "conversely , for gold nanoparticles the plasmon excitation , in the @xmath0 spectral range , overlaps the low - energy wing of the interband transitions @xcite , so that there is a mixing of both excitations .",
    "however , the raman scattering selects the conduction - electron part of the dipolar plasmon for the resonance enhancement @xcite .",
    "such a resonance effect was confirmed in the ag - au alloy particles in which the contribution of the conduction electrons in the plasmon band increases with the concentration of silver @xcite .",
    "the study of the ni - ag nanoparticles is interesting for two reasons .",
    "one the one hand , the dipolar plasmon excitation does not exist in nickel nanoparticles due to the strong extinction coefficient originating from both the intraband and interband transitions .",
    "nevertheless , when adding some silver to the nickel , the contribution of the conduction electrons is expected to lead to a surface plasmon resonance . on the other hand , nickel and silver do not form an alloy , at least in macroscopically sized samples . in consequence , it will be interesting to determine the confinement effect on the spatial distribution of the ag and ni atoms and to observe the evolution of the dipolar plasmon excitation as a function of the silver concentration in the nanoparticles .",
    "the different points that were addressed in our research are the following : ( 1 ) the resonance effect in the raman scattering from ni - ag nanoparticles embedded in dielectric matrix , ( 2 ) the spatial distribution of ni and ag atoms in the nanoparticles , ( 3 ) the vibrational modes in the composite nanoparticles .",
    "in our experiment , clusters are produced in a laser vaporization source , described in previous papers @xcite . the beam of a frequency - doubled nd : yag pulsed laser ( @xmath1 ) is focused onto a bimetallic rod of given @xmath2 composition ( @xmath3 to 1 in step of 0.25 ) .",
    "a continuous helium flow cools the laser - produced plasma , and the mixture finally combines into clusters and undergoes a supersonic expansion through a nozzle , at the exit of the source .",
    "moreover , the size distribution and therefore the mean size of the nanoparticles in the sample is controlled by varying the helium pressure .",
    "then , the neutral clusters pass through a skimmer into a vacuum chamber ( under approximately @xmath4 ) where they are deposited on a substrate , simultaneously with the alumina matrix .",
    "the alumina is evaporated with an electron gun , and the choice of the substrate depends on the characterization experiments to be performed .",
    "the metal volumic fraction is taken below @xmath5 to minimize the cluster coalescence .",
    "the alumina is amorphous and slightly over - stoichiometric in oxygen @xmath6 , and very porous ( about @xmath7 ) .",
    "energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) and rutherford back scattering ( rbs ) analyses show that the average stoichiometry of the clusters in the sample is the same as in the alloy rod .",
    "low - energy ion scattering ( leis ) measurements on @xmath2 clusters show that the silver atoms move onto the surface of the mixed particles @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the lower surface energy of silver compared to nickel .",
    "one can also emphasize that silver and nickel are known to be immiscible metals in the bulk .",
    "transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) shows almost spherical , and randomly distributed nanoparticles , and allows to determine the size distribution ( fig .",
    "the optical transmission of the films deposited on pure silica ( suprasil ) has been measured with a double beam perkin - elmer spectrophotometer , in the photon energy range @xmath8 - @xmath9 ( @xmath10 - @xmath11 ) . due to the rather low metal volumic fraction in the films",
    "the recorded transmission reflects the  size distribution - averaged  absorption of the individual particles .    in fig .",
    "2 are displayed absorption spectra of embedded @xmath12 clusters for three different compositions ( @xmath3 , 0.5 , 0.75 ) and of pure ni clusters ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this last one does not show any resonance ( simple mie calculations indicate that this holds true for the whole spectral range ) . when some silver is added to the nickel , a broad band appears on the absorption spectra .",
    "this absorption band , which is due to the surface plasmon resonance , becomes very pronounced for silver concentration exceeding @xmath7 ( @xmath14 ) and the larger the silver concentration in the nanoparticles , the narrower the band plasmon .",
    "moreover , in all the spectra where a plasmon band occurs , one can see that this latter is almost in the same spectral range as the one obtained for pure silver clusters .",
    "more details about this study have been given previously @xcite .",
    "the raman spectra were recorded on a dilor z40 monochromator .",
    "the high rejection rate and resolution of this setup , which is due to its five gratings , makes it possible to measure a low - frequency signal close to the rayleigh line .",
    "all the visible lines of an @xmath15 and a @xmath16 laser were used for excitation .",
    "it was controlled that the laser beam does not heat the sample .",
    "the incoming light beam is at grazing incidence and the scattered one was detected at @xmath17 with respect to excitation .",
    "no low - frequency raman scattering was observed from pure ni nanocrystals in alumina film with blue , green or red excitations .",
    "relatively intense low - frequency peaks appear from ni - ag nanoparticles , even with only @xmath18 of silver ( fig .",
    "3 ) . as for pure silver nanoparticles",
    "@xcite , both an intensity decrease and a shift to lower frequencies were observed when the excitation is turned from the blue to the red .",
    "these observations clearly illustrate the effect of resonance with the silver conduction - electron contribution to the dipolar plasmon .",
    "the one - electron intraband or interband absorption transitions of nickel do not contribute to the resonance enhancement of the raman scattering by nanoparticle vibrational modes .",
    "it was also the case for the interband transitions of gold @xcite .",
    "the depolarization ratio , @xmath19 , of the raman intensity for perpendicular polarizations of excitation and scattered lights ( @xmath20 ) over the one for parallel polarizations ( @xmath21 ) has been measured .",
    "@xmath22 by excitation at @xmath23 , and @xmath24 by excitation at @xmath25 .",
    "it is well known from group theory and due to the plasmon resonance effect that only the quadrupolar modes of nanoparticles exhibit high raman activity @xcite . for raman scattering by the five - fold degenerate quadrupolar modes of spherical particles",
    "the theoretical depolarization ratio is found to be equal to 0.75 @xcite . on the other hand , for resonant raman scattering by the non - degenerate mode of randomly oriented ellipsoidal particles it is equal to 0.33 . by comparison with these theoretical values ,",
    "the experimental depolarization ratios show that the nanoparticles which are excited in the green are mainly the spherical shaped ones while they are ellipsoidal in the red , as it was established for pure silver nanocrystals @xcite .",
    "the raman scattering by the quadrupolar modes is relatively intense because of the strong coupling between the vibrational quadrupolar modes and the electronic dipolar plasmon in silver nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "recently , the raman scattering by spherical modes ( i.e. the breathing mode and its two first harmonics ) was observed for silver nanocrystals with narrow size dispersion @xcite . in the case of nanoparticles with a relatively broad size dispersion , as in this experiment ,",
    "the raman peaks corresponding to the scattering by the spherical modes are expected to be of very weak intensity .",
    "so , these peaks can be easily masked by the high - frequency tail of the much more intense raman peak due to the quadrupolar mode , and it is therefore not surprising that they do not appear on our lfrs spectra ( fig .",
    "one observes in fig .",
    "3 that the position of the raman peak does not depend very much on the composition of the nanoparticles .",
    "this is a priori not consistent with a homogeneous mixing of ni and ag atoms , the elastic constants of nickel being approximately two times larger than the silver ones .",
    "this is in agreement with the ni - ag demixion observed by leis @xcite . in the following part",
    ", the experimental vibrational frequencies will be compared to the calculated ones for demixed nanoparticles consisting of a nickel core and a silver shell .",
    "it is expected that the vibrational dynamics of the ni - ag core - shell nanoparticles depends crucially on the coupling between the silver shell and the nickel core .",
    "the resolution of the navier equation , by using the continuous medium approximation , demonstrates @xcite that the vibrational frequencies @xmath26 of a spherical nanoparticle are inversely proportional to the diameter @xmath27 and proportional to the transversal sound velocity @xmath28 :    @xmath29    the factor @xmath30 depends on the mode and on the ratio of the transversal and longitudinal sound velocities .",
    "the frequency @xmath26 corresponds to the raman shift @xmath31 , that is generally expressed in @xmath32 : @xmath33 , c being the vacuum light speed .",
    "equation-[one ] was experimentally verified by the comparison of the small angle neutron scattering with the raman scattering by nanocrystals embedded in a glassy matrix @xcite . in the following , the frequency calculated from eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) , with @xmath34 being the diameter at the maximum of the size distribution , will be compared to the frequency at the maximum of the low - frequency raman band .",
    "the suitability of this procedure lies on the assumption that there is no spatial coherence in the nanoparticle , as it was demonstrated in previous papers for nanoparticles obtained by the same elaboration technique @xcite .",
    "according to the lamb s theory @xcite on the vibrations of an elastic sphere , the @xmath30 factor is close to 0.85 and 0.84 for the fundamental quadrupolar mode , in the case of silver and nickel respectively .",
    "the used transversal sound velocities for nickel and silver are respectively @xmath35 = 3000\\,m / s$ ] and @xmath36 = 1660\\,m / s$ ] @xcite . using these values , without taking explicitly into account the bonding strength between ag and ni atoms and the inhomogeneous distribution of the two metals in the nanoparticles ,",
    "it is found by taking the concentration - weighted average sound velocity in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) , that the vibration frequency of a @xmath37 nanoparticle is 1.3 times larger than that of a @xmath38 particle of same size .",
    "the experimental ratio is equal to 0.9 , and consequently far from the theoretical ratio .",
    "faced with this discrepancy and in agreement with the leis experiment @xcite , it is assumed that the nanoparticles have a core - shell geometry with a ni core and a ag shell , as suggested above .",
    "the possibility that the immiscible metals separate upon silver and nickel particle formation can be rejected for two reasons : ( 1 ) no leis from nickel was observed @xcite , ( 2 ) the absorption bands ( fig .",
    "2 ) are much broader than the ones obtained from the simple superposition of the absorptions by separate silver and nickel nanoparticles .",
    "the vibration frequencies of the core - shell nanoparticle can be calculated by using the navier equation with specific boundary conditions ( see appendix ) .    in the first model",
    ", it is assumed that there is continuity of both the vibrational displacement and the force at the ni / ag interface , and no force at the nanoparticle / matrix interface ( due to the large matrix porosity , the contact between the matrix and the particle is very loose so that the hypothesis of free vibrations is justified ) . for the studied samples , the calculated vibrational frequencies of the quadrupolar mode are more than two times or even more than three times too large in comparison with the experimental ones ( cf .",
    "it is worth noting that the calculated values are not far from the frequencies obtained from eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) by taking the concentration - weighted average sound velocity .",
    "this discrepancy between the experimental and calculated frequencies proves that the hypothesis of a strong contact between the ni core and the ag shell is not correct .    in the second model",
    ", the hypothesis of a core - shell structure is kept , but now it is assumed that the ag shell boundary at the ag / ni interface is free ( no force , i.e. , no effective contact of the ag shell with the ni core ) . as it can be seen in the table , the frequencies calculated for the ag shell quadrupolar vibrations are very close to the experimental ones , while they are about four times larger for the ni core vibrations .",
    "this agreement is a strong indication that the vibrations observed by raman scattering are those of the ag shell .",
    "this is not surprising , since the raman process is resonant , and that only the conduction - electrons in silver contribute to the effect of resonance .",
    "the free internal boundary of the ag shell is a priori more questionable .",
    "however , this approximation can be justified .",
    "silver and nickel do not form an alloy , this means that the bonding between ag and ni atoms is weaker than between same atoms .",
    "moreover , the atomic radii of these metals are different ( @xmath39  , @xmath40  ) , resulting in a mismatch between the ni and ag lattices . furthermore , weak raman lines corresponding to nickel oxyde were observed and it is likely that nickel atoms at the ag / ni interface are oxydized .",
    "nickel is much more oxydizable than silver , so that some nickel atoms can have been oxydized during the deposition process , and likely after deposition by oxygen diffusion through the porous alumina matrix and the thin silver shell . in consequence",
    ", it is expected that the ag / ni interface is relatively loose .",
    "moreover , the elastic constants of ni are approximately three times larger than the ag ones , so that there exists a large difference between the vibrational frequencies of the ni core and the ag shell , and consequently , the phase matching is hardly achieved .",
    "another type of core - shell nanoparticle was considered to simulate the ag / ni interface . between the ag shell and the ni core ,",
    "a thin shell of a soft x material is placed .",
    "its thickness is chosen to be @xmath5 of the core radius .",
    "this type of structure is symbolized by core - x - shell in the table . taking a density equal to @xmath41 and a sound velocity equal to @xmath42 in the x material , and assuming the vibrational and force continuity at the inner interfaces , the calculated frequencies for the fundamental quadrupolar mode are again close to the experimental ones ( cf .",
    "however , in this model the vibrational frequencies are dependent on both the sound velocity and the density of the x material . the free ag shell approximation , which does not use adjustable parameters , is convincing enough to allow the interpretation of the low - frequency raman lines as due to the plasmon - resonant scattering by the quadrupolar vibrations of the free silver shell in ni - ag core - shell nanoparticles .",
    "low - frequency raman scattering was observed from nanoparticles of same composition with smaller diameters ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "the experimental frequencies are approximately two times smaller than the ones calculated with the free shell model .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the unsuitability of the continuous medium approximation for so small nanoparticles .",
    "very recently , it was shown by simulation that this approximation becomes unvalid for sizes smaller than some limit and that the sound velocity which has to be taken in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) can be much smaller than the bulk one @xcite .",
    "however , such a simulation , that was carried out for amorphous two - dimensional clusters using lennard - jones potential , does not allow to estimate this limit for our metallic nanocrystals .",
    "the observation of low - frequency raman scattering by the quadrupolar vibrational mode of nickel - silver composite nanoparticles confirms that there is an effect of resonance with the silver conduction - electron contribution to the surface dipolar plasmon excitation .",
    "no low - frequency raman scattering was observed from pure nickel nanoparticles .",
    "the frequencies of the vibrational modes are in agreement with a core - shell structure of the particles .",
    "the raman experiment is quantitatively well interpreted by assuming that the scattering originates from the vibrations of a silver shell loosely bonded to the nickel core .",
