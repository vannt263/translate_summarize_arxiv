    "understanding the behaviour of the strong interacting matter for moderate temperatures and high baryonic density is one of the main tasks in astrophysics for describing the interior of neutron stars and regions close to the core of collapsing stars . in the interior of that objects , at high densities ,",
    "the deconfinement transition from hadronic to quark matter might occur .",
    "this transition , in astrophysical compact and dense objects , is basically studied in two scenarios : in protoneutron stars ( pns ) and neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "the pns are compact objects remaining after the gravitational collapse and supernovae explosion of a massive star .",
    "initially the temperature is about few tens of mev and the neutrinos are temporarily trapped in the interior of the pns .",
    "after a few seconds of evolution , the neutrinos are radiated , and the pns cools down turning into a ns .",
    "the interior of these objects can reach a density well above the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath1 ) , and in this scenario the hadronic matter can suffer a deconfinement transition into quark matter @xcite .",
    "the phase transition should begin with the nucleation of a small ( @xmath2 m ) quark - matter droplet near the center of the star @xcite that may later grow through a combustion process converting a macroscopic portion of the star into quark matter @xcite .",
    "even though hadrons are a bound state of quarks , we can not describe with a single model the thermodynamics of the transition from hadronic to quark matter .",
    "then , we need to adopt different models to describe each phase . in the present paper we analyse the deconfinement transition in protoneutron star conditions employing the mit bag model in the description of quark matter . for the hadronic phase we use a model based on a relativistic lagrangian of hadrons interacting via the exchange of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the nucleation is treated as a first order phase transition and the finite size effects of creating a droplet of deconfined quark matter in the hadronic environment are described using the multiple reflection expansion ( mre ) framework @xcite .",
    "two important features we consider in our work are : ( a ) quark flavor is conserved during the deconfinement transition because it is driven by strong interactions @xcite and ( b ) when color superconductivity is included together with flavor conservation , the most likely configuration of the just deconfined phase is two - flavor color superconductor ( 2sc ) provided the pairing gap is large enough @xcite .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> we impose flavour conservation during the transition , which means that the just deconfined quark droplet is transiently out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that trapped neutrinos slightly increase the critical density for deconfinement and that color superconductivity significantly decreases such density at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the nucleation rate is negligible for droplets larger than @xmath0 fm and is huge for smaller droplets provided that the temperature is low enough . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with previous calculations using the nambu - jona - lasinio model with color superconductivity and the mit bag model without color superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the deconfinement transition should be triggered instantaneously when a density slightly larger than the bulk transition density is reached at some layer of a protoneutron star . since color superconductivity lowers the transition density at low temperatures , the transition is likely to occur after significant cooling in a massive enough protoneutron star . </S>"
