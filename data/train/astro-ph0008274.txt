    "however , low luminosity sources could be described with either a single component model , such as a power - law or thermal bremsstrahlung ( see white , nagase & parmar 1993 and references therein ) , or two component models involving a harder component and a softer blackbody ( @xcite ) . in an attempt to describe the emission process , white et al .",

    "the quantum efficiency of the sis detectors has been slowly degrading due to radiation damage , and the current detector calibrations do not account for the loss of efficiency .",
    "when we compared the gis and sis standard screened data sets ( rev 2 ) using the latest redistribution matrix and ancillary response files , we found that the flux differed by as much as 15% between the two detectors at energies between 1 to 2 kev and at energies greater than 8 kev . by selecting only the single pixel events ( grade 0 ) in the sis",

    "relatively low luminosity lmxbs atoll sources have been shown to have both a comptonized emission and a soft thermal emission , like their high luminosity counterparts .",
    "the question remains however whether the soft and the comptonized emissions originate in the same regions regardless of the accretion rate ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1989 ) found that a multi - color disk and a comptonizing boundary layer could explain the emission during a high state of 4u 1608 - 522 , but a number of authors have pointed out that the soft thermal component seen in the low state of other atoll sources could come from either the disk or from an optically thick boundary layer ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the comptonized emission originates in the compact boundary layer and the soft emission comes from the disk , the inferred inner disk radius in ( @xmath31 km ) is in good agreement with a canonical neutron star radius .",
    "the inner disk temperature of 0.9 kev is also consistent with that observed from 4u 1608 - 522 and 4u 1820 - 30 in their high accretion states ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for gx 354 - 0 , the lack of soft emission could indicate that the disk truncates at a large radius .",
    "if the excess at 6 - 7 kev is interpreted as an iron fluorescence line , the line energy of 6.4 kev again suggests that the emission is due to the fluorescent emission from the neutral iron in the cool outer disk and not from the hot inner disk .",
    "alternatively , the comptonized emission could arise in the extended accretion disk corona ( adc ) while the soft component originates near the neutron star surface . for ks 1731 - 260 ,",
    "the blackbody temperature ( 0.6 kev ) is comparable to the blackbody temperatures found in similar lmxbs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but the best fit blackbody radius for ( 24 km ) is large for a neutron star . in the case of gx 354 - 0 , an extended adc subtending a large angle to the disk could result in either a disk reflection component with a large reflection fraction , or a broadened line emission .",
    "the best fit value of the reflection fraction is somewhat uncertain since we did not have the high energy coverage to constrain the reflection hump .",
    "however , the large disk reflection fraction is similar to the values seen from gs 1826 - 34 and 4u 1608 - 522 in their low hard states ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the excess at @xmath74 kev is instead due to the fluorescence emission from the disk , sunyaev and titarchuk ( 1980 ) found that photons escaping from a comptonizing cloud will result in an estimated line broadening of @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the compton wavelength and @xmath77 is the optical depth . from the observed line width",
    "@xmath70 kev we derive an optical depth @xmath78 , consistent with the best fit value from gx 354 - 0 .",
    "our results from are best described with a compact comptonizing boundary layer , and the results from are seemingly consistent with either of the emission models .",
    "however , both models suffer from other observational and theoretical difficulties . in the case of a comptonizing boundary layer ,",
    "the hard emission is confined to be near the neutron star surface , @xmath79 cm for 1.4mneutron star . yet , in the analysis of dipping lmxbs , the light curve is best described by a partial covering of an extended corona ( @xmath80 cm ) and a compact soft source ( @xcite ) .",
    "a compact hard emission region would also seem unlikely to produce the broad emission line or the large disk reflection seen from gx 354 - 0 . in the case of an extended comptonizing corona with an optically thick boundary layer ,",
    "sunyaev & shakura ( 1986 ) showed the ratio of the luminosity from the boundary layer should be equal or larger than the luminosity from the corona , if the disk extends to the marginally stable orbit . yet , the luminosity ratio of the boundary layer to the corona is typically too small ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our observation is no exception ; the luminosity ratio of the boundary layer to the corona is only 0.24 for and even less for gx 354 - 0 .",
    "the energy release in the boundary layer may be reduced if the neutron star spins at near breakup ( @xcite ) , but neither of the neutron stars ( at 363 hz , @xcite ; at 260 hz , @xcite ) appear to rotate at speeds close to break up .",
    "another possible emission mechanism is that the boundary layer may be optically thin during periods of low accretion ( @xcite ) . citing spectral similarities between neutron star lmxbs and black hole lmxbs in their low states , barret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggests that an optically thin accretion flow such as an advection - dominated solution of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) could replace the standard inner disk in lmxbs .",
    "if an optically thin accretion flow could transition to the neutron star surface in an optically thin boundary layer , the spectrum would be dominated by comptonized emission , and only a small fraction of the flux would come from the neutron star surface or the accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "in such a scenario , it is plausible that we have observed the interaction of the cold outer disk with the comptonizing corona in the low accretion state of gx 354 - 0 , namely the 6.4 kev iron line or the reflection from a weakly ionized disk .",
    "the broadening of the iron line may be due to the dispersion in the corona if the corona subtends a large solid angle as seen from the disk . at higher accretion rate",
    ", the optically thin corona is expected to collapse to an optically thick disk ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "correlation of the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillation to the spectral parameters also gives good indication that the disk moves toward the central source during periods of high accretion ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one would then expect to observe more emission from the hot ionized disk at higher accretion rate .",
    "this is consistent with the 6.7 kev iron line and the @xmath81 kev disk blackbody component reported by di salvo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and piraino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in their observations of during higher flux states .",
    "similarly , a soft component , in addition to the comptonizing component , was also observed from ks 1731 - 260 in its medium and high flux states with asca and rxte .",
    "our observations with asca did not find the broad 6.4 kev line that was seen by rxte , however the upper limit equivalent width set by our asca observations is marginally consistent with that found by rxte . since the energy resolution of the pca detector on board rxte is 18% at 6 kev",
    ", it is possible that the the broad line seen with rxte was a superposition of ionized and non - ionized lines .",
    "presumably , such a state would exist during a transitions between the low and high accretion states , where the emissions from both the outer disk and the inner disk are visible .",
    "further observations using the high resolution gratings on chandra or xmm may provide more direct evidence on the strength of the line emissions at various accretion rates",
    ". such study should be valuable in constraining the extent of the adc and its interaction with the accretion disk .",
