    "the main motivation for studying heavy ion collision at high energy is the study of quantum chromodynamics in extreme conditions of high temperature and high energy density@xcite .",
    "one of the proposed signatures of a possible phase transition of nuclear matter to deconfined state of quarks and gluons is the modification of vector meson production rates and their in - medium properties@xcite .",
    "@xmath1 meson is of particular interest due to its very short life time and its strange quark content , which makes @xmath1 meson sensitive to the properties of the dense matter and provide information regarding strangeness production from early partonic phase@xcite@xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath1 meson provides a better understanding on the role of rescattering and regeneration effects in hadron production .",
    "the interplay of these two competing processes is guaged through particle ratio studies of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath9 and nucleus - nucleaus collisions .",
    "the mass of @xmath1 is close to the mass of baryons ( @xmath10 ) but it is a vector meson , the measurements of @xmath1 nuclear modification factor @xmath11 or @xmath12 compared to those of @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be utilized to distinguish whether the observed differences between the @xmath12 of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are due to difference in their mass or baryon - meson effect@xcite . in the intermediate @xmath0 range , the identified hadron elliptic flow @xmath6 measurements have shown that the hadronic @xmath6 follows a simple scaling of the number of constituent quarks in the hadrons .",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath15 measurement may reveal the @xmath1 production mechanism in hadronic phase@xcite .",
    "the results discussed here are taken from au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath2= 200 gev and @xmath2= 62.4 gev at rhic .",
    "the time projection chamber@xcite within star was used to measure the @xmath1 production via its hadronic decay channel .",
    "the unlike sign k@xmath16 invariant mass distribution was reconstructed eventwise from random combination of k@xmath16 pairs .",
    "the combinatorial background distribution was built by using mixed - event technique@xcite .",
    "the mixed event generated was normalized to subtract the background in the same event unlike - sign invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the @xmath5 signal was observed after subtracting the normalized mixed event background from the unlike sign spectrum .",
    "figure [ signal](left panel ) shows the unlike sign k@xmath16 invariant mass spectrum after normalized mixed event background subtraction in minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath2= 62.4 gev .",
    "the invariant mass distribution is fitted to the function sbw + rbg where sbw is the non relativistic breit - wigner function and rbg is the linear function describing the residual background@xcite .",
    "figure [ signal](right panel ) shows the acceptance and efficiency corrected @xmath5 @xmath17 spectra for @xmath18 for different centralities in au+au collisions at @xmath2= 62.4 gev .",
    "figure [ particleratio](left panel ) depicts the @xmath19 ratio normalized by their values in p+p collisions at the same beam energy .",
    "the decrease of the ratio with the number of participants indicates that the rescattering of the decay particles dominates over resonance regeneration . in figure",
    "[ particleratio](right panel ) , we observe an increase of @xmath20 ratio normalized by their values in p+p collisions with number of participants.this again favours dominance of rescattering effect on @xmath5 .",

    "the @xmath21 @xmath12 in au+au collisions at 200 gev and 62.4 gev are smaller than that of @xmath14 and @xmath22 , indicating strong rescattering of @xmath21 decay particles at low @xmath0 . for @xmath24 1.8 gev / c ,",
    "the @xmath21 @xmath12 in au+au collisions at 200 gev is more closer to the @xmath22 @xmath12 which favours a baryon - meson effect of the particle production in the intermediate @xmath0 region .",
    "figure [ v2 ] shows @xmath21 elliptic flow @xmath15 as a function of @xmath0 in minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath2= 200 gev .",
    "it was fit with function@xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are fixed parameters extracted by fitting @xmath22 and @xmath28 data points in reference@xcite , and @xmath29 is an open parameter representing the number of constituent quarks .",
    "fitting the @xmath21 @xmath6 data with function given in eqn.[v2func ] gives a value of @xmath30 with @xmath31 = 2/6 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath5 are dominantly produced from direct quark combinations , and @xmath1 regeneration is negligible in the hadronic stage .",
    "the preliminary results on the @xmath5 production in au+au and cu+cu collisions measured with the star detector at rhic at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev and @xmath2 = 200 gev are presented .",
    "the particle ratio and @xmath12 measurement supports the dominance of rescattering effect over the regeneration mechanism in @xmath5 production . a significant non - zero elliptic flow @xmath6 of k *",
