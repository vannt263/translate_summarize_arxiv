    "in the authors view , our present foggy picture of the glass transition begins to show some cornerstones of a future solid theoretical building , namely the energy landscape concept ( goldstein 1968 ; johari and goldstein 1970 , 1971 ; stillinger 1995 ) , the mode coupling theory ( bengtzelius 1984 ; gtze and sjgren 1992 ) together with the realization ( bengtzelius 1984 ; angell 1988 ) that the critical temperature of this theory marks the onset of thermally activated motion between the minima of the energy landscape , and , finally , the calculation of the kauzmann temperature from the interatomic potentials ( m@xmath2zard and parisi 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "these theories explain , at least in principle , the dynamics above and around @xmath0 as well as the thermodynamics near to the calorimetric glass transition @xmath1 , leaving only the fragility ( angell 1988 ; bhmer 1993 ; angell 1995 ) without a solid theoretical foundation .",
    "the present paper expands this view in a bit more detail in the next two sections .",
    "section 4 addresses the relaxation in glasses at temperatures well below @xmath1 in terms of thermally activated jumps in an ensemble of independent asymmetric double - well potentials ( the adwp ( symmetric ouble ell otential ) ( pollak and pike 1972 ) or gilroy - phillips model ( gilroy and phillips 1981 ) ) . section 5 considers the effect of the interaction between different relaxation centers , which is shown to become dominant at the glass transition .",
    "section 6 compares the prediction of a mean field treatment to experimental data on the breakdown of the shear modulus .",
    "conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "the mode coupling theory of the glass transition ( gtze and sjgren 1992 ) does not require the concept of the energy landscape .",
    "in fact , its most impressive experimental proof was found in colloids ( pusey and van megen 1986 ; van megen and underwood 1994 ) , which do not have an energy landscape .    on the other hand , the dynamics of the undercooled liquid at lower temperatures",
    "is dominated by thermally activated hopping between different valleys of the energy landscape . the conjecture ( bengtzelius 1984 ; angell 1988 ) of an onset of this thermally activated motion at the critical temperature @xmath0 of the mode coupling theory has found more and more support from numerical simulations of model glass formers ( schrder 2000 ;",
    "angelani 2000 ; broderix 2000 ; but see also doliwa and heuer 2002 , which stress the important role of thermal activation above @xmath0 ) .",
    "the main result is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , adapted from angelani ( 2000 ) . as one lowers the temperature towards @xmath0 , the average number of saddle points of the energy landscape on which the system finds itself at a given moment in time decreases .",
    "this number extrapolates to zero at @xmath0 . at @xmath0 ,",
    "one still finds a finite number of unstable instantaneous normal modes . however , these stem from shoulders of the potential with a negative curvature rather than from true saddle points .",
    "they give rise to the fast picosecond motion ( angell 1995 ) , but they do not dominate the long time dynamics .    above @xmath0 , the separation of the @xmath4-process ( the elementary process of the flow ) from the microscopic picosecond motion ( franosch 1998 ) in an undercooled liquid seems to be reasonably well described by the mode coupling theory .",
    "this was demonstrated by neutron ( knaak 1988 ; frick 1991 ; wuttke 1993 ) and light scattering experiments ( li 1992 ; sokolov 1998 ; wiedersich 2000a ) on ionic , molecular and polymeric glass formers , as well as in a number of numerical simulations ( kob and andersen 1995a , 1995b ; nauroth and kob 1997 ; kammerer 1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "there are more examples ( gtze 1999 ) .",
    "one finds the proper scaling relations for the time and temperature dependence of the @xmath4-process and the fast picosecond @xmath5 process , consistent with the exponents determined from the temperature dependence of the viscosity above @xmath0 . as a general rule ( sokolov 1998 )",
    ", one finds @xmath6 s , a bit longer than the originally considered value ( goldstein 1968 ; angell 1988 ) of @xmath7 s.    note this does not imply a perfect fit of theory and experimental data .",
    "though one observes the expected power law behaviour of the viscosity in many liquids ( taborek 1986 ) , accurate dielectric data in salol show a temperature dependence of the power law exponent of @xmath8 even well above @xmath0 ( stickel 1995 ) .",
    "quantitative checks of the theory are at present impeded by the difficulty to calculate @xmath0 and the exponents for most real glass formers .",
    "nevertheless , the mode coupling theory is a true microscopic theory , which in principle allows to calculate its parameters from a knowledge of the interatomic potentials .",
    "the results obtained so far seem to show that one can identify the critical temperature of this microscopic theory with the temperature at which the system leaves the saddle points of the energy landscape to settle in its valleys . below @xmath0 ,",
    "one expects a gradual transition to thermally activated energy landscape dynamics .",
    "though there is no generally agreed description of this landscape dynamics , there is at least a microscopic theory ( m@xmath2zard and parisi 1996 , 1999 ) for the thermodynamics of the undercooled liquid at this lower temperature .",
    "this further important theoretical progress of the last decade concerns an old concept from the thermodynamics of the glass transition , the kauzmann temperature .",
    "the concept stems from the experimental observation that the entropy difference between undercooled liquid and crystal seems to extrapolate to zero at a finite temperature , the kauzmann temperature @xmath9 , at which the glass former in principle condenses into a single structural configuration . since the viscosity depends on the number of accessible configurations , one expects a divergence of the viscosity at about the same temperature ( an excellent review of the older empirical attempts to model the thermodynamics and kinetics of the undercooled liquid has been given by jckle ( 1986 ) ) . in this general sense ,",
    "the kauzmann temperature is not only important for the thermodynamics , but also for the dynamics close to @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the empirical adam - gibbs model identifies the temperature @xmath9 with the vogel - fulcher temperature @xmath10 of the empirical vft ( vogel - fulcher - tammann ) or wlf ( williams - landel - ferry ( ferry 1980 ) ) relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a microscopic time and @xmath13 is a second parameter of this empirical relation .",
    "if one looks more closely ( stickel 1995 , 1996 ; hansen 1997 ) , the vogel - fulcher relation does not describe the temperature dependence of @xmath8 very well . from this data collection ,",
    "one rather feels that each glass former behaves differently below @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the general tendency of a divergence of the viscosity as the glass former looses its configurational entropy can not be denied .",
    "m@xmath2zard and parisi ( 1996 , 1999 ) have devised a recipe to calculate the entropy and the kauzmann temperature from the pair potentials of a given glass former , thus providing the kauzmann extrapolation scheme with a theoretical solidity which it lacked before .",
    "the calculation assumes an undercooled liquid below @xmath0 which spends most of its time vibrating in a local minimum of the free energy , with only occasional jumps into a neighboring minimum .",
    "in this situation , one assumes the validity of the harmonic approximation for the motion within the single well . using the replica concept ,",
    "one calculates the free energy as a function of temperature and finds a nonzero kauzmann temperature .",
    "this is again a microscopic theory , because it allows to calculate the heat capacity and the kauzmann temperature from the pair potentials between the atoms . though the kauzmann temperature itself might still prove to be an artefact of the mean - field approximation of the calculation , the calculated heat capacity above this temperature resembles measured data above @xmath1 both in shape and size .",
    "the next section proceeds to a phenomenological model of the thermally activated energy landscape dynamics in the low - temperature glass phase .",
    "the adwp ( asymmetric - double - well - potential ) ( pollak and pike 1972 ) or gilroy - phillips model ( gilroy and phillips 1981 ) is a member of a family of three glass models , which are essentially one and the same model applied to three different situations ( the other two are the tunneling model ( phillips 1981 ) and the soft - potential model ( parshin 1994 ) ) .",
    "the basic idea is to simplify the multiminimum situation of the energy landscape to an ensemble of independent double - well potentials for local structural rearrangements with a broad distribution of different barrier heights @xmath14 and asymmetries @xmath15 between the two minima ( see fig .",
    "2 ) - an inherently heterogeneous description of the dynamics of the glass phase ( for a review on the heterogeneity of undercooled liquids see richert 2002 ) .",
    "consider a single relaxing entity , i.e. a single barrier of height @xmath14 separating two neighboring energy minima .",
    "2 shows schematically the energy as a function of the configurational coordinate going from one minimum to the other . in numerical simulations of model glasses",
    ", one finds that this configurational coordinate involves the motion of about five to fifty atoms in the center of the relaxing entity ( heuer and silbey 1996 ; schober and oligschleger 1996 ) .",
    "there is no reason why the two minima should have the same energy , so there will be an energy difference @xmath15 between them .",
    "a further characteristic of the two adjacent minima is the coupling of this relaxing entity to the external shear strain @xmath16 .",
    "this is given by the coupling constant @xmath17 , defined such that the asymmetry changes from @xmath15 to @xmath18 under the applied shear strain @xmath16 .",
    "with these three energies , the barrier height @xmath14 , the asymmetry @xmath15 and the coupling constant @xmath17 , one can quantify the contribution of this single relaxing entity to the dynamical mechanical behaviour of the viscoelastic medium .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath19 is given by the arrhenius relation @xmath20 where @xmath12 is a microscopic time of the order of 10@xmath21 seconds , @xmath14 is the energy of the barrier between two energy minima of the system , and @xmath22 is the temperature .    in the simplest possible approximation , the free energy @xmath23 of the single relaxation center reads @xmath24.\\ ] ] its second derivative with respect to the shear distortion @xmath16 is @xmath25 the second derivative determines the contribution of the specific relaxing entity to the difference between the shear moduli at infinite and zero frequency .",
    "the main influence on the shear modulus is due to relaxation in potentials with asymmetries smaller than @xmath26 ; for larger asymmetries the influence decreases rapidly because of the square of the hyperbolic cosine in the denominator .",
    "we assume a number density function @xmath27 of these local structural relaxations , which varies little if @xmath14 or @xmath15 change by energies of the order @xmath26 . integrating over the asymmetry ( buchenau 2001 )",
    ", we obtain a net difference @xmath28 between the infinite and the zero frequency shear moduli due to relaxations with barrier heights between @xmath14 and @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the infinite frequency shear modulus .",
    "this relation defines @xmath32 , the barrier density function _ without _ interaction .    in the frozen glass phase ,",
    "one expects a frozen - in distribution of barrier heights and asymmetries and thus a temperature - independent @xmath32 .",
    "one can check that by looking at the distribution with low and high frequencies ; according to the arrhenius relation , eq .",
    "( [ arrh ] ) , one should be able to observe the same barrier height at different temperatures .",
    "such checks have been done for a number of different glass formers . as long as one stays at temperatures much lower than the glass temperature , one finds impressive agreement with the idea of a temperature - independent barrier density function .",
    "one example is vitreous silica up to 300 k , glass temperature 1473 k ( wiedersich 2000b ) .",
    "another one is polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) below 80 k , glass temperature 383 k ( buchenau 2002 ) . for higher temperatures ,",
    "however , the barrier density function tends to increase with increasing temperature ( surovtsev 1998 , caliskan 2002 ) .    as will be shown in the next section",
    ", one has to expect such an increase , because the interaction between different relaxation centers determines the dynamics close to the breakdown of the shear modulus . in this view , the johari - goldstein @xmath5-process , a broad relaxation maximum close to the @xmath4-process which shows an arrhenius behaviour both below and above @xmath1 ( johari and goldstein 1970 , 1971 ; kudlik 1999 ) corresponds to a peak in @xmath32 , strongly enhanced by the proximity of the breakdown .",
    "for the purpose of this and the following section , let us assume that the decomposition of the complex energy landscape into an ensemble of single relaxation centers or single relaxing entities is a reasonable and solid basis . in a mean - field scheme ,",
    "the interaction between the single entity and all the others is taken into account by embedding the single center into the viscoelastic medium , calculating the viscoelastic properties selfconsistently .",
    "the first implication of this mean - field assumption is that the asymmetry @xmath15 is no longer fixed , but changes on the maxwell time scale , because the viscoelastic medium is free to flow .",
    "consequently , the term @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) can adapt on the maxwell time scale , thus changing @xmath15 to a different value .",
    "the maxwell time @xmath34 is given by the shear viscosity @xmath35 and the infinite frequency shear modulus g @xmath36 where all three quantities depend on temperature , the infinite frequency shear modulus @xmath31 only weakly , but the two other quantities drastically .",
    "a change in @xmath15 does not mean that the energy landscape itself flows ; to take a three - dimensional example , the barrier is like a ridge between two sloping valleys with different slope ; going along the ridge changes the height difference of the two valleys .",
    "in this example , the coordinate along the ridge could correspond to the external shear strain ; then one has a continuous change of @xmath15 .",
    "it could also correspond to the configurational coordinate of another relaxing entity in the neighborhood , which changes the local shear strain at the given relaxation center in a discontinuous way .",
    "it is interesting to consider the consequences of a freely changing value of @xmath15 .",
    "taking eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) literally , one calculates a boltzmann factor of the relaxing entity @xmath37 which has its lowest value at the symmetric case , @xmath38 , and diverges with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "this latter feature is of course unphysical , because one can not expect to gain energy without limit by increasing the asymmetry of such a local entity .",
    "however , the consideration shows that one must expect a relatively low probability for the symmetric case , because it is energetically unfavorable .",
    "in fact , both the number of tunneling states and the excess entropy of the frozen glass seem to decrease in selenium upon aging ( johari 1986 ) .    as soon as @xmath15 is able to change , the relaxing entity has an additional possibility to find its thermal equilibrium , namely by lowering the energy of the minimum in which the system happens to find itself .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that relaxation centers with high barriers , whose relaxation time exceeds the maxwell time , do not contribute to the viscoelastic properties of the medium , while those with shorter relaxation times have time to equilibrate by jumps over the barrier and do contribute .",
    "the two barrier regimes are separated by the maxwell barrier @xmath39 with @xmath40    consider the energetics of a single double - well , with a barrier low enough to equilibrate within the maxwell time .",
    "suppose a small constant shear strain @xmath16 is switched on at time zero , with the population of the minima of the double - well in thermal equilibrium with respect to zero shear strain .",
    "the new thermal equilibrium requires a number of jumps @xmath41 in order to calculate the energy @xmath42 carried to the heat bath , we have to multiply the number of jumps @xmath43 with the energy difference @xmath18",
    ". therefore these jumps transport the energy @xmath44 from the macroscopic shear stress energy to the heat bath .",
    "the term on the right hand side linear in @xmath16 must be compensated by other relaxing entities with opposite sign of @xmath15 ( otherwise there would be no initial equilibrium ) . if one compares the second quadratic term @xmath45 with the second derivative of the free energy in eq .",
    "( [ asymm ] ) , one finds that it is twice as high as the free energy decrease @xmath46 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ asymm ] ) @xmath47 which determines the reduction of the shear modulus by the barrier .",
    "the physical reason for this is the reduced entropy ; spending the energy one has spanned an entropic spring .",
    "thus the reduction of the shear modulus is only half that expected from the spent energy .",
    "this is in principle textbook knowledge for a debye relaxation , but is explained here again , because it is essential for the understanding of the glass transition .    in a gedankenexperiment ,",
    "let the thermally equilibrated relaxation center return from the actual asymmetry @xmath18 in the strained state to its original asymmetry @xmath15 , say by appropriate jumps in the surroundings which change the local strain at the center . in principle , this return would again require the energy @xmath42 , to be taken again from the macroscopic stress energy .",
    "however , this return occurs on the maxwell time scale , which is long compared to the relaxation time of the relaxation center .",
    "therefore the population of its two minima adapts adiabatically .",
    "the number of backjumps is again the same @xmath43 , but now the asymmetry reduces gradually from @xmath18 to @xmath15 in the course of the process , reducing the average energy per jump to @xmath48 .",
    "this means one needs only the energy @xmath49 to return .",
    "now imagine this happens for all relaxation centers with barriers lower than the maxwell barrier of eq .",
    "( [ vm ] ) in the undercooled liquid .",
    "then one returns to an unstrained equilibrium in the strained state .",
    "this means a full relaxation of the initial stress , as in the true flow process characterized by the maxwell time .",
    "naturally , our gedankenexperiment is a rather improbable realization of this process , because in the real process a given relaxation center will almost never return to its initial asymmetry , though the macroscopic stress relaxes back to zero .",
    "however , this special realization allows to keep track of the energy contributions .    in this cycle from the initial equilibrium to a new equilibrium in the strained state , each barrier with @xmath19 smaller than @xmath34 takes the energy @xmath50 from the stress energy , @xmath51 in the initial equilibration and @xmath46 on the maxwell time scale .",
    "the direct reduction of the shear modulus , the one expected if there were no interaction between different barriers , corresponds only to a single @xmath46 .",
    "the energy @xmath50 is taken from the potential energy in the strain field , reducing it to zero .",
    "one arrives at the conclusion that the stress relaxation occurs when the noninteracting relaxation centers reduce the shear modulus by one third of its infinite frequency value . to put it differently",
    ", the interaction between relaxing entities reduces the number needed to bring the long time shear modulus down to zero by a factor of three .    in terms of the barrier density function @xmath32 ,",
    "this means @xmath52",
    "this is the 1/3-rule , which allows to calculate the maxwell barrier ( and from the maxwell barrier , the shear viscosity ) for a given barrier density function @xmath32 .",
    "the barrier density function @xmath32 in turn can be determined from measurements at times shorter than the maxwell time . to do this",
    ", one needs a quantitative treatment of the interaction between different relaxation centers , which is the topic of the next section .",
    "the 1/3-rule provides a qualitative understanding of the fragility : as the temperature increases , @xmath32 is expected to increase , because symmetric double - well potentials are energetically unfavorable , as pointed out at the beginning of this section .",
    "this implies that @xmath39 decreases with increasing temperature , as one indeed observes in experiment .",
    "the problem is to make this understanding quantitative .",
    "one could hope to use the theoretical tools of m@xmath2zard and parisi ( 1996 , 1999 ) to achieve this end .",
    "the 1/3-rule , eq . ( [ norm ] ) , can be derived independently ( buchenau 2002 ) from the assumption @xmath53    eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) is a generalization of the definition of the barrier density function @xmath32 _ without _ interaction , eq .",
    "( [ f0 ] ) , to describe the enhancement of the effect of a single relaxation center by the interaction , together with the cutoff at the maxwell time .",
    "the equation defines a barrier density function @xmath54 _ with _ interaction , which can then be used to calculate the full shear response .",
    "one can justify the quadratic enhancement factor assuming a constant strain applied at time zero .",
    "the relaxation will tend to equilibrate at the time @xmath19 , when the square of the stress - a measure of the remaining stress energy - is reduced by precisely this factor , while the number of jumps required for the equilibration may be taken to be unchanged . if the number of jumps and the distortion remain unchanged , the energy and the free energy contribution remain unchanged .",
    "this implies that the reduction of the stress energy by the relaxation is also unchanged .",
    "this in turn increases the apparent barrier density function @xmath54 by the square of @xmath55 .",
    "a physical interpretation of this increase are lower - barrier jumps , taking place in the neighborhood after a jump of the central entity .",
    "one can do a selfconsistent calculation of @xmath54 for a given @xmath32 by inserting the expression for @xmath56 in terms of @xmath54 into eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) .",
    "this leads to an integral equation for @xmath54 with the approximate solution ( buchenau 2002 ) @xmath57^{2/3}},\\ ] ] where the maxwell time is again given by the 1/3-rule , eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) .",
    "the denominator of eq.([fin ] ) tends toward zero as @xmath14 approaches the maxwell barrier .",
    "therefore the breakdown of the shear modulus occurs in a rather dramatic way .",
    "the relaxing entities at this critical barrier value receive a strong enhancement , to such an extent that one is tempted to assume a separate @xmath4-process which has nothing to do with the secondary relaxations .",
    "in fact , this more or less unconscious assumption underlies most of the present attempts to understand the glass transition ( ediger 1996 ) .",
    "the above mean - field treatment shows such an assumption to be unnecessary ; what one sees at the glass transition are simple arrhenius relaxations of no particularly large number density , blown up to impressive size by the small denominator of eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) .",
    "once @xmath54 is known , one can determine the frequency dependence of the complex shear modulus at the frequency @xmath58 from the two relations @xmath59 and @xmath60    one must expect @xmath32 and , consequently , @xmath54 to be a different function for each glass former .",
    "in many of the cases , however , one should be able to approximate @xmath32 by the constant value @xmath61 for barriers close to @xmath39 .",
    "such a choice is also suggested by the appearance of a constant loss term ( kudlik 1999 ; ngai 2000 ; sokolov 2001 ) in many glass formers just below @xmath1 .",
    "a constant loss term corresponds to a constant @xmath54 . in the model with a barrier - independent @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath54 decreases and approaches @xmath32 as one goes from the maxwell barrier to lower barriers . for this generic case",
    ", one can calculate @xmath62 and @xmath63 at the breakdown of the shear modulus and compare the result to measured data .",
    "there are some good mechanical shear measurements over many decades in frequency at @xmath1 ( christensen and olsen 1994 ; christensen and olsen 1995 ; behrens 1996 ; donth 1996 ) .",
    "3 shows data for @xmath64 , normalized to the peak maximum .",
    "the continuous line is calculated from the model assuming @xmath65 and using eqs .",
    "( [ fin ] ) and ( [ gpp ] ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 , the fit is only good for the two polymers polystyrene and poly(vinyl acetate ) ; the two molecular glass formers show a much stronger decay of @xmath63 towards the high frequency end . for these",
    ", the model gives a peak in the imaginary part of the shear modulus which is too small and too broad ; the real breakdown of the shear modulus is more dramatic than the mean field calculation .",
    "a better fit requires an increase of @xmath32 at the maxwell barrier ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "3 ) . one can rationalize this increase ; it might be necessary to reach a large peak in @xmath32 before the shear modulus breaks down .",
    "dielectric measurements ( kudlik 1999 ) provide much more accurate peak shapes than mechanical ones .",
    "however , these data are usually presented as real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant , which is essentially a susceptibility .",
    "the model discussed here calculates moduli .",
    "these should be identical with the dielectric ones as long as the weighting of the relaxation centers according to the electric dipole moments corresponds to the one of the mechanical shear coupling constants .",
    "a comparison requires a conversion of the dielectric constants to dielectric moduli ( dyre 1991 ) , which changes the peak shape considerably . christensen and olsen ( 1994 )",
    "show three examples where dielectric moduli data give exactly the same peak shape as mechanical shear modulus data .",
    "there begins to be a general agreement that the mode coupling theory of the glass transition ( gtze and sjgren 1992 ) is the proper microscopic theory for the separation of the structural relaxation time from the microscopic picosecond time scale in undercooled liquids .",
    "however , the structural relaxation time of real liquids does not diverge at the critical temperature @xmath0 of the theory .",
    "it rather reaches a a typical value between a nanosecond and a microsecond ( sokolov 1998 ) , indicating a crossover to a different flow mechanism .",
    "numerical simulations ( schrder 2000 ; angelani 2000 ; broderix 2000 ; but see also doliwa and heuer 2002 ) corroborate the old conjecture ( bengtzelius 1984 ; angell 1988 ) that at @xmath0 the system leaves the saddle points of the energy landscape to settle in the valleys .    at still lower temperatures , one can use the approximation of harmonic energy minima , with only occasional thermally activated jumps in between .",
    "this is the starting point of a second microscopic theory ( m@xmath2zard and parisi 1996 , 1999 ) for the entropy of the undercooled liquid , which allows to calculate the puzzling heat capacity at the calorimetric glass transition from the interatomic potentials .",
    "these two theories provide some microscopic insight ( though one could wish for theories which are easier to handle ) .",
    "the breakdown of the shear modulus at the calorimetric glass transition has as yet no microscopic explanation .",
    "one can show that it can not be treated in terms of independent double - well relaxation centers ( pollak and pike 1972 ; gilroy and phillips 1981 ) , because the interaction becomes dominant at this breakdown , reducing the number of relaxation centers needed for the breakdown by a factor of three ( the 1/3-rule ) . a mean - field treatment ( buchenau 2002 ) of the interaction allows to calculate the shear response at the breakdown .",
    "the comparison to measured data shows agreement in some glass formers , but a more pronounced breakdown in others .",
    "one can rationalize this finding by postulating a rise of the barrier density function @xmath32 at the maxwell barrier for the latter ones .",
    "a disappointing feature of the relaxation center picture is that one needs a whole temperature - dependent function , the barrier density function @xmath32 , to describe the dynamics around @xmath1 .",
    "it is not enough to classify glass formers as type a or b ( kudlik 1999 ) , depending on whether @xmath32 shows a strong peak ( johari - goldstein peak ) below @xmath39 or not . on the other hand , this is a logical consequence of the validity of the energy landscape idea , because the energy landscape is different in different glass formers .",
    "if all relaxation centers up to the maxwell barrier contribute to the flow process , then the description of its temperature and frequency dependence can not be done by a single parameter .",
    "below @xmath0 , each glass former develops its own identity , a conclusion supported by experiment ( stickel 1995 , 1996 ; hansen 1997 ) .",
