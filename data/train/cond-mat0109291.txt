    "the phenomenon of bose  einstein condensation and superfluidity in bose - systems is a subject of great interest .",
    "superfluidity in liquid helium-4 can be easily observed now but the measurements on the condensate fraction remain a difficult problem because of the strong interactions in this fluid .",
    "researchers , both experimentalists and theorists , now generally concur that @xmath1 of atoms are in the lowest ( zero momentum ) state at zero temperature .",
    "the relative number of atoms with zero momentum is called condensate fraction , here we denote it as @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of the calculation of condensate fraction in liquid helium-4 was first considered in the classical paper by penrose and onsager  @xcite .",
    "the authors used a very rough approximation of hard spheres for the ground - state wavefunction and calculated this quantity as approximately 0.08 or 8% .    during recent twenty years",
    "different methods for measurements and theoretical calculations of the condensate fractions were used .",
    "neutron scattering is used to draw the information on the momentum distribution and hence on the condensate fraction .",
    "@xcite obtained the value 13.9% .",
    "later , similar value of 13.3% was obtained by sears  @xcite using the data on the temperature variations of the average kinetic energy .    numerical study based on the variational method",
    "were carried out in the series of works by manousakis , pandharipande _",
    "_  @xcite by means of jastrow wavefunction with three - body corrections .",
    "their results vary within @xmath3 .",
    "the numerical estimations of the condensate fractions were made also in the series of works by vakarchuk _",
    "et al _ and vakarchuk  @xcite leading to the results of @xmath4 .",
    "the methods used in these papers are based on the mean - spherical approximation for the structure functions of liquid helium-4 at zero temperature  @xcite , direct quantum - mechanical computations from the first principles  @xcite .    the value of approximately 10% was obtained for @xmath2 by sokol and collaborators by means of deep - inelastic neutron scattering at high - momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) methods were also used to study the question of the condensate fraction .",
    "the result of whitlock and panoff  @xcite is @xmath5 ( green function mc ) .",
    "ceperley and pollock  @xcite obtained value @xmath6 using path integral mc technics at 1.18  k. also , moroni _ et al _",
    "@xcite gives 7.2% from diffusion mc simulations .",
    "approximately in the same time the experimental result of @xmath7 was obtained by azuah _",
    "@xcite .",
    "series of papers by mayers _ et al _",
    "@xcite was devoted to both calculation of the condensate fraction based on phenomenological assumptions @xcite ( result is 9.9% ) and measurements on the high - energy scattering @xcite ( @xmath8 at 1.3  k ) .",
    "recent high precision measurements of the dynamic structure factor allowed glyde _ et al _  @xcite to derive the information on the condensate fraction at zero temperature and its temperature dependence .",
    "they report @xmath9 at 0  k.    a semi - phenomenological method for extracting the condensate fraction data was proposed recently by rinat and taragin  @xcite .",
    "authors obtained @xmath2 at different temperatures and extrapolated their results to 0  k as @xmath10 .",
    "the aim of this work is to show a possibility of calculation of the condensate fraction without drawing any special huge computational efforts .",
    "the method we use was worked out in  @xcite .",
    "the condensate fraction is calculated directly from the single - particle distribution function @xmath11 as its long - range limit : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of particles in zero momentum state and @xmath14 is the total number of particles in the system .",
    "our technics do not involve any phenomenological assumptions .",
    "for the computations we use as input only one experimental quantity , the static structure factor of helium at zero temperature .",
    "it is the advantage comparing to those methods for which such quantities as the dynamic structure factor is necessary .",
    "its precise measurement is much more complicated problem comparing with that of the static structure factor .",
    "the method is fully controlled , i.  e. , we always know which effects are neglected , and it is not difficult to take them into account in the next approximation ( in principle ) . here",
    "we present only the first approximation ( rpa ) but the expressions are easily extendable in order to take subtler effects like many - particle interactions .",
    "the only key problem arising while extending our method further is the knowledge of the static three - particle structure factor . unlike usual structure factor",
    ", it is not an easily measurable quantity already .",
    "one of the ways for its calculation we see in such a scheme : expressions for the three - particle distribution function @xmath15 ( beyond superposition approximation ) containing pair distribution function @xmath16 6-dimensional fourier transformation of @xmath15 leading to the three - particle structure factor .",
    "a separate paper will be devoted to this problem .",
    "we consider three different approaches for the short - range repulsive interactions . in the first one ,",
    "they are not taken it into account explicitly at all . in the second approach",
    "this repulsion is modeled by meyer s function @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the radius - vector absolute value .",
    "we chose @xmath19   and @xmath20 .",
    "this potential is referred here as ` almost hard spheres ' ( ahs )  @xcite .",
    "the third model is the potential of hard spheres ( hs ) with diameter 2.1   .",
    "principal calculating procedure consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "* input * : experimental data on the structure factor @xcite [ procinput ] ( should be converted into the zero temperature @xcite ) ; 2 .",
    "* input * : model for the short - range interactions [ procmodel ] ( hs , ahs or none ) @xcite ; 3 .",
    "* output * : structure factor of the model system corresponding to the short - range repulsion ; [ proc_sqsr ] 4 .   * output * : fourier transformation of the interatomic potential [ proc_nuq ] ( effective ) @xcite ; 5 .",
    "* output * : pair distribution function @xmath21 [ proc_f2 ] @xcite ; 6 .",
    "* result * : condensate fraction .",
    "[ proc5 ]    in this work , we propose a simple method for the calculation of the condensed fraction using formulae obtained earlier in @xcite : @xmath22,\\nonumber\\\\ & & h(r)=f_2(r)-1 , \\qquad h^*(r)=\\sqrt{f_2(r)}-1,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dots denote terms having more than one integration over wave vector or coordinate , @xmath21 is the pair distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath14 is the number of atoms , and @xmath23 @xmath24 is helium density , @xmath25  @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the mass of helium atom , @xmath28  a.  m.  u. , @xmath29 is the wave vector .",
    "the expression for pdf within the accepted approach was obtained in  @xcite : @xmath30 while the self - consistent description of short- and long - range correlations in liquid helium-4 results in such a result for the function @xmath31  @xcite : @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the structure factor of the model system ( it equals 1 if the short - range repulsion is not given explicitly ) , superscript ` s.  r. ' corresponds to ` short - range ' .",
    "@xmath34 is the experimental structure factor ( at 0  k ) .",
    "these expressions contain @xmath35 being the fourier image of the interatomic potential in helium that has an effective nature .",
    "it is obtained from the first principles using the collective variables formalism in the schrdinger equation , as described in @xcite .    on the step ( [ proc_nuq ] ) of the calculation procedure we encountered problems while considering the hs short - range potential .",
    "the reason is clear : a weak damping of the structure functions at large values of wave vector or radius vector requires much more careful numerical computations comparing to those in two other cases .",
    "some usual problems appear on the step ( [ proc_f2 ] ) of the calculating procedure where we smoothed @xmath21 calculated from ( [ f2def ] ) and truncated it at the distances @xmath36   .",
    "we put @xmath37 in order to obtain a correct pdf at small distances  @xcite .",
    "we present the calculated pdfs in comparison with the experimental ( being more precise , derived from the measurements on the liquid structure factor ) one  @xcite in the fig .",
    "[ f2fig ] .",
    "we have calculated the condensate fraction at zero temperature using different models for the short - range repulsive part of the potential .",
    "we expect the real value being about @xmath41 less than the calculated one due to the contribution of the higher - order terms , as described in  @xcite .",
    "but in the first approximation we consider it to be a good accuracy for @xmath2 in liquid helium-4 .",
    "our result for the condensate fraction is within the range of theoretical , numerical and experimental estimations mentioned here in the introductory part of the paper . since our expressions are derived from the first principles , one can use the number for @xmath2 calculated in this way as a test for the condensate fraction information indirectly extracted from the experimental measurements .",
    "this becomes possible after the next one and two approximations are computed .",
    "we found that the short - range repulsive part of the potential has a significant influence on the results for the condensate fraction .",
    "namely , when the short - range interactions are included into the consideration explicitly , the results appear to be essentially dependent on the `` hardness '' of the core . a proper model for this interaction will be found when more terms are taken into account in the expressions ( [ initial ] ) , ( [ f2def ] ) .",
    "the reason is that in principle the summation of the whole series corresponds to the correct calculation of the short - range interactions  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the condensate fraction in liquid helium-4 is a very sensitive ( with respect to the order of approximation ) quantity .",
    "thus , we can expect that having found such a model we obtain a possibility to use simple rpa - like expressions instead of higher - order ones . by now",
    ", the ahs ( @xmath20 , @xmath19   ) potential seems to be the most suitable for this purpose .",
