    "there exist numerous examples for the production of particles in heavy ion collisions at bombarding energies well below the single nucleon - nucleon threshold @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon indicates collective interactions among the many participating nucleons and thus is expected to give information about the hot and dense matter formed in these collisions . at beam energies around 1  gev per nucleon",
    "the most extreme of these subthreshold particles is the antiproton .",
    "therefore , it is believed to be a very sensitive probe to collective behaviour in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "however , presently neither the production mechanism nor the final state interactions of antiprotons in dense nucleonic matter are well understood .",
    "the antiproton yields measured at gsi and bevalac @xcite seem to be described equally well by various microscopic models using different assumptions about the production mechanism and particle properties in dense nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity raises the question which kind of information can be really deduced from subthreshold @xmath0 spectra . in this paper",
    "we use a simple thermodynamic framework as a background on wich we can systematically study the influence of different assumptions on the final @xmath0 spectrum .    in the next section",
    "we will focus on the production process . following",
    "a discussion of the final state interactions of the antiproton in dense hadronic matter in section  [ sec3 ] , we use in section  [ sec4 ] a one - dimensional hydrodynamic model for the exploding fireball to clarify which features of the production and reabsorption mechanisms should survive in the final spectra in a dynamical environment .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "unfortunately very little is known about the production mechanism for antiprotons in dense nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , we are forced to use intuitive arguments to obtain a plausible expression for the production rate . as commonly done in microscopic models",
    "@xcite we consider only two body collisions and take the experimentally measured cross sections for @xmath0 production in free nn collisions as input .",
    "the problem can then be split into two parts : the distribution of the two colliding nucleons in momentum space and the elementary cross sections for antiproton production .",
    "the procedure is later generalized to collisions among other types of particles ( section  [ sec2c ] ) using phase space arguments .",
    "formally , the antiproton production rate @xmath1 , i.e. the number of antiprotons produced in the space - time cell @xmath2 and momentum space element @xmath3 , is given by @xcite @xmath4 in this expression the summation includes all incoming particle species @xmath5 and @xmath6 with 4-momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 and phase space distributions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the integration is over the invariant collision energy @xmath11 and the phase space of the two colliding particles : @xmath12 finally , @xmath13 is the well known flux factor , and @xmath14 the differential @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "the influence of the shape of the phase space distributions and of the differential production cross sections will now be investigated in more detail , beginning with the case of @xmath0 production by @xmath15 collisions .",
    "assuming that the momentum distribution of the nucleons gradually evolves from @xmath16-peaks at the momenta of the colliding nuclei to a relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distribution , an analytical expression for the phase space distribution @xmath17 was derived by schrmann _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "we use this model as the basis for a numerical evaluation of the probability @xmath18 of finding two nucleons at a center - of - mass energy @xmath19 at time @xmath20 ( the second integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) ) .",
    "[ bild1 ] shows @xmath18 at @xmath21  fm / c after the nuclei have started overlapping , assuming a bombarding energy of 1  gev / a .",
    "although the initial @xmath16-like distribution at @xmath22 widens quite rapidly , the extreme states needed for antiproton production ( @xmath23 ) are populated substantially only after about 5  fm / c . at this moment",
    "the distribution is already nearly a relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( dashed line ) which maximizes the @xmath0 production rate in our approach .",
    "this fact motivates us to neglect pre - equilibrium production and to switch on @xmath0-production only when the system has reached local thermal equilibrium .",
    "similiar conclusions have been drawn from the results of a microscopic kinetic model for the phase space evolution @xcite .",
    "there it was demonstrated that only nucleons which have suffered at least several collisions are effective in @xmath0 production .",
    "there are no experimental data for the nucleonic processes @xmath24 @xmath25 close to the production threshold . as already pointed out in @xcite , different extrapolations of the data at higher energies down to threshold change the @xmath0-yield by orders of magnitude .",
    "however , we will show that not only the total yield , but also the shape of the spectrum is very sensitive to the threshold behaviour .",
    "we choose for the production cross section the parametrization @xmath26 where the parameter @xmath27 models the shape of the cross section near threshold .",
    "the normalization @xmath28 is determined by the experimentally measured point closest to threshold .",
    "if the behaviour of @xmath29 were dominated by the available phase space for the outgoing particles ( this is the fundamental assumption in fermi s statistical model @xcite ) , then @xmath30 .    in order to obtain from the total cross section ( [ sigtot ] ) a formula for the differential cross section , we assume like others that the momentum distribution of the produced particles is mainly governed by phase space",
    "this leads to the simple relationship @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the volume the @xmath33-particle phase space , which can be given analytically in the non - relativistic limit @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is the total 4-momentum of the 4-particle final state , which reduces to @xmath34 in the cms of the four particles .    inserting ( [ sigtot ] ) and ( [ sigdiff ] ) into ( [ p ] ) and using thermal phase space distributions",
    ", the production spectrum can be evaluated numerically . as seen in fig .",
    "[ spektrum ] , the sensitivity on the threshold power @xmath27 is particularly pronounced for low - energy antiprotons .",
    "the strong deviation at low @xmath0 energies from a thermal shape ( dashed lines ) for small values of @xmath27 is most remarkable .    using the fermi value @xmath35 for the cross section , an analytical expression for the production rate",
    "can be obtained : @xmath36 here @xmath37 are the densities of the incoming particles , @xmath38 is the threshold for producing an antiproton with momentum @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the local temperature of the environment . clearly the rate @xmath1 is proportional to the product of the densities of the two colliding particle species @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "more importantly , this formula shows the extreme sensitivity on the production threshold and on the medium temperature which both appear in the exponent of the exponential function .",
    "the production of resonances as intermediate energy storage has been pointed out as an important mechanism for @xmath0 production in @xcite .",
    "because no experimental data are available for antiproton production by baryonic resonances , we follow common strategy @xcite and assume that the cross section @xmath41 is independent of the internal state of excitation of the colliding baryons in our thermal picture .",
    "the consequences of this assumption are quite obvious . while the distance to the @xmath0-threshold is reduced by the larger rest mass of the resonances , the mean velocity of a heavy resonance state in a thermal system is smaller than that of a nucleon .",
    "both factors counteract each other , and indeed we found that the total rate @xmath1 is not strongly changed by the inclusion of resonances .    the role of pionic intermediate states for @xmath0-production in @xmath42-collisions was pointed out by feldman @xcite .",
    "as mesons are created numerously in the course of a heavy ion collision , mesonic states gain even more importance in this case .",
    "in fact , ko and ge @xcite claimed that @xmath43 should be the dominant production channel . relating the @xmath44-production channel to the @xmath45 annihilation channel @xcite by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spin factor for the @xmath48 ,",
    "the production rate can be calculated straightforwardly from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) : @xmath49 the spin - isospin factor of the @xmath48 is @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the energy of the produced antiproton .",
    "the modified bessel function @xmath52 results from the assumption of local thermal equilibration for the @xmath48-distribution .",
    "expanding the bessel function for large values of @xmath53 we see that the `` temperature '' @xmath54 of the @xmath0-spectrum is only half the medium temperature : @xmath55 .    finally , the meson - baryon collision process @xmath56 remains as the last prototype of collisions with two incoming particles .",
    "we choose a parametrisation for the cross section which reflects its qualitative behaviour @xcite : @xmath57 comparing this form with measured data on @xmath58 collisions @xcite , a value of @xmath59  mb is obtained .",
    "due to the threshold behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ sigpi ] ) and the rather large value of @xmath60 , it turns out @xcite that this process is by far the most important one in a _ chemically _ equilibrated system .",
    "however , this chemical equilibration ",
    "if achieved at all  is reached only in the final stages of the heavy ion collision when cooling has already started .",
    "so it is by no means clear whether the dominance of the meson - baryon channel remains valid in a realistic collision scenario .",
    "this point will be further discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "once an antiproton is created in the hot and dense hadronic medium , its state will be modified by interactions with the surrounding particles .",
    "two fundamentally different cases have to be distinguished : elastic scattering , which leads to a reconfiguration in phase space , driving the momentum distribution towards a thermal one with the temperature of the surrounding medium , and annihilation .",
    "each process will be considered in turn .",
    "the time evolution of the distribution function @xmath61 is generally described by the equation @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the transition probability from momentum state @xmath64 at time @xmath65 to state @xmath39 at @xmath66 . because the number density of antiprotons is negligible compared to the total particle density in the system",
    ", the evolution of @xmath61 can be viewed as a markov process .",
    "assuming furthermore that the duration of a single scattering process @xmath67 and the mean free path @xmath68 are small compared to the typical time scale @xmath69 and length scale @xmath70 which measure the variation of the thermodynamic properties of the system , @xmath71 eq .  ( [ f1 ] ) can be transformed into a master equation . considering the structure of the differential @xmath45 cross section one",
    "notices that in the interesting energy range it is strongly peaked in the forward direction @xcite .",
    "therefore , the master equation can be approximated by a fokker - planck equation @xcite : @xmath72 for the evaluation of the friction coefficient @xmath73 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath74 we follow the treatment described by svetitsky @xcite .",
    "for the differential cross section we took a form suggested in @xcite : @xmath75 } { |t|}\\,,\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath76 are fitted to experimental data .",
    "@xmath68 is the wave number of the relative motion , @xmath20 the transferred four momentum and @xmath77 a spherical bessel function .",
    "the essential result @xcite is that the coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath78 are nearly independent of the @xmath0 momentum and satisfactorily fulfill the einstein relation @xmath79    the effect of these coefficients can be visualized by examining the time evolution of a non - relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distribution whose initial slope @xmath80 is different from the temperature of the medium : @xmath81 in a medium at fixed temperature @xmath82  mev and normal nuclear density @xmath83 the solution @xmath61 of the fokker - planck equation can be calculated analytically : @xmath84      \\equiv \\exp{\\left [ - p^2/2 m t_{\\rm eff}(t)\\right ] } \\,.\\ ] ] this shows that the exponential shape of the distribution function is maintained throughout the time evolution , but that the slope @xmath85 gradually evolves from @xmath80 to the value @xmath86 which , according to the einstein relation ( [ einstein ] ) , is the medium temperature @xmath40 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ abb33 ] it is clear that after about 10  fm / c the spectrum is practically thermalized",
    ". therefore initial structures of the production spectrum ( like the ones seen in fig .",
    "[ spektrum ] ) are washed out quite rapidely , and their experimental observation will be very difficult",
    ".      the annihilation of antiprotons with baryons is dominated by multi - meson final states @xmath87 . for the parametrisation of the annihilation cross section",
    "@xmath88 we take the form given in @xcite for the process @xmath89    using the same philosophy as for the calculation of the production rate , a simple differential equation for the decrease of the antiproton density in phase space can be written down : @xmath90 this equation shows that the absorption rate is given by the thermal average of the annihilation cross section @xmath91 = \\langle v \\sigma^{\\rm ann } \\rangle$ ] where @xmath92 is the @xmath0 velocity .",
    "although @xmath93 is strongly peaked for low - energy antiprotons , the thermal average @xmath94 is practically independent of the @xmath0 velocity in the medium .",
    "therefore , in a stationary medium the shape of the @xmath0 spectrum is maintained ; the momentum independence of @xmath73 leads only to a renormalisation of the spectrum by annihlation .",
    "any modifications of the spectral shape must be due to the dynamical evolution of the hadronic medium .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath73 decreases slightly with increasing temperature ; it is of the order of 0.5 ( fm/@xmath95)@xmath96 at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "this means that 99% of the antiprotons are absorbed within 9  fm / c .",
    "of course , due to the rather large value of the absorption rate @xmath73 which is of the order of the size of the antiproton , the classical approach chosen in our model becomes questionable .",
    "more reliable results should be based on a quantum field theoretic calculation which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in order to compare the results of the two previous sections with experimental data we connect them through a dynamical model for the heavy ion reaction . in the spirit of our thermodynamic approach the so - called hadrochemical model of montvay and zimanyi @xcite",
    "is applied for the simulation of the heavy ion collision . in this picture",
    "the reaction is split into two phases , an ignition and an explosion phase , and particles which have at least scattered once are assumed to follow a local maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "in addition , a spherically symmetric geometry is assumed for the explosion phase .",
    "the included particle species are nucleons , @xmath97-resonances , pions and @xmath48-mesons .    as initial condition",
    "a fermi - type density distribution is taken for the nucleons of the incoming nuclei , @xmath98 with the nuclear radius @xmath99 and a surface diffuseness @xmath100  fm . because the fermi motion is small compared to the typical bombarding energy of 1  gev / a",
    ", it can be neglected , and the initial phase space distribution therefore reads @xmath101 here @xmath102 describes the path of the center of the nucleus .",
    "due to elastic and inelastic scattering hot and dense matter is formed in the central region .",
    "its time - dependent chemical composition is governed by the kinetic equations of the hadrochemical model given in ref .",
    "their particular form needed here can be found in @xcite .",
    "some of the resulting distributions are visualized in fig .",
    "[ vert90 ] for a central @xmath103ca-@xmath103ca collision with momentum @xmath104  mev in the c.m . system .",
    "one clearly sees that at the moment of full overlap of the two nuclei a dense zone with hot nucleons , resonances and mesons ( not shown ) has been formed . only in the peripheral regions `` cold '' target and projectile nucleons can still be found .",
    "on the other hand , chemical equilibrium of the hot collision zone is not reached in the short available time before the explosion phase sets in ; pions and in particular @xmath48 mesons remain far below their equilibrium abundances @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that due to the arguments given in section  [ sec2 ] @xmath0 production is strongly suppressed in this initial stage of the reaction . in our simple model",
    "we have in fact neglected this early @xmath0 production completely .",
    "the ignition phase is only needed to obtain the chemical composition of the hot fireball which is expected to be the dominant source for the creation of antiprotons .",
    "for the subsequent expansion of the spherically symmetric fireball into the surrounding vacuum analytical solutions can be given if the equation of state of an ideal gas is taken as input @xcite .",
    "if excited states are included in the model , an exact analytical solution is no longer possible .",
    "because a small admixture of resonaces is not expected to fundamentally change the dynamics of the system , we can account for their effect in first order by adjusting only the thermodynamic parameters of the exploding fireball , but not the expansion velocity profiles .",
    "there is one free parameter in the model @xcite , @xmath27 , which controls the density and the temperature profiles , respectively .",
    "small values @xmath105 represent @xmath16-function like density profiles whereas @xmath106 corresponds to a homogeneous density distribution throughout the fireball ( square well profile ) .",
    "the time - dependent temperature profiles for two representative values of @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "[ abb47 ] for different times @xmath20 starting at the time @xmath107 of full overlap of the nuclei . clearly , a small value of @xmath27 leads to an unreasonably high temperature ( @xmath108  mev ) in the core of the fireball at the beginning of the explosion phase , and should thus be considered unphysical .",
    "based on the time - dependent chemical composition of this hadrochemical model we can calculate the spectrum of the antiprotons created in a heavy ion collision .",
    "let us first concentrate on the influence of the density distribution in the fireball characterized by the shape parameter @xmath27 .",
    "due to different temperature profiles connected with different @xmath27 values ( see fig .",
    "[ abb47 ] ) the absolute normalization varies substantially when the density profile is changed . for more @xmath16-like shapes an extremely hot fireball core",
    "is generated , whereas for increasing @xmath27 both density and temperature are more and more diffuse and spread uniformly over a wider area . because of the exponential dependence upon temperature a small , but hot core raises the production rate drastically .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ abb54 ] for three values of @xmath27 . not only the total normalization , but also the asymptotic slope of the spectrum is modified due to the variation of the core temperature with @xmath27 as indicated in the figure .    comparing the dotted lines , which give the pure production spectrum , to the solid lines representing the asymptotic spectrum at decoupling , the tremendous effect of antiproton absorption in heavy ion collisions is obvious .",
    "as one intuitively expects absorption is more pronounced for low - energetic antiprotons than for the high - energetic ones which have the opportunity to escape the high density zone earlier .",
    "therefore , the finally observed spectrum is flatter than the original production spectrum .    interestingly , while the baryon - baryon and the @xmath44 channels are comparable in their contribution to @xmath0 production , the pion - baryon channel turned out to be much more effective for all reasonable sets of parameters .",
    "this fact is indeed remarkable , because here , contrary to the discussion in section  [ sec2 ] , the pions are not in chemical equilibrium ; in our hadrochemical model the total time of the ignition phase is too short to saturate the pion channel .",
    "the meson - baryon channel is thus crucial for understanding @xmath0 spectra . only by including all channels reliable predictions about the antiprotons",
    "can be drawn .",
    "we did not mention so far that in our calculations we followed common practice and assumed a finite @xmath0 formation time of @xmath109  fm / c ; this means that during this time interval after a @xmath0-producing collision the antiproton is assumed to be not yet fully developed and thus can not annihilate . however , there are some ( although controversial ) experimental indications of an extremely long mean free path for antiprotons before final state interactions set in @xcite .",
    "we have tested the influence of different values for the formation time @xmath67 on the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "[ abb55 ] shows that this highly phenomenological and poorly established parameter has a very strong influence in particular on the absolute normalization of the spectra , i.e. the total production yield . in the light of this uncertainty it appears difficult to argue for or against the necessity for medium effects on the antiproton production threshold based on a comparison between theoretical and experimental total yields only .      in all the calculations shown above a bombarding energy of 1  gev / a has been assumed .",
    "experimental data are , however , only available at around 2  gev / a . at these higher energies thermalization becomes more questionable @xcite , and our simple model may be stretching its limits .",
    "especially , the temperature in the fireball core becomes extremely high . in order to avoid such an unrealistic situation and in recognition of results from kinetic simulations @xcite we thus assume that only part of the incoming energy is thermalized  in the following a fraction of 70% was taken .",
    "[ bild111 ] shows calculations for the antiproton spectrum from na - na and ni - ni collisions at a kinetic beam energy of 2 gev / nucleon .",
    "the calculation assumes a @xmath0 formation time of @xmath110 fm/@xmath95 , and takes for the density and temperature profiles the parameter value @xmath111 which corresponds to an upside - down parabola for the density profile . comparing with the gsi data @xcite we see our model features too weak a dependence on the size of the collision system ; the absolute order of magnitude of the antiproton spectrum is , however , correctly reproduced by our simple hadrochemical model , without adjusting any other parameters .",
    "no exotic processes for @xmath112 production are assumed . as mentioned in the previous subsection ,",
    "the pion - baryon channel is responsible for getting enough antiprotons in our model , without any need for a reduced effective @xmath0 mass in the hot and dense medium @xcite .",
    "the existing data do not yet allow for a definite conclusion about the shape of the spectrum , and we hope that future experiments @xcite will provide additional contraints for the model .",
    "heavy ion collisions at typical bevalac and sis energies are far below the @xmath45-production threshold . as a consequence , pre - equilibrium antiproton production in such collisions",
    "is strongly suppressed relative to production from the thermalized medium produced in the later stages of the collision .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 production becomes important only when the heavy ion reaction is sufficiently far progressed , in accordance with microscopic simulations @xcite . by assuming a local maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the scattered and produced particles forming the medium in the collision zone one maximizes the @xmath0 production rate ( see fig .  [ bild1 ] ) .",
    "if , contrary to the assumptions made in this work , the extreme states in phase space described by the tails of the thermal boltzmann distribution are not populated , the antiproton yield could be reduced substantially .",
    "we also found that the threshold behaviour of the @xmath0 production cross section is not only crucial for the total @xmath0 yield , but also introduces structures into the initial @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "this might give rise to the hope that by measuring the @xmath0 momentum spectrum one may obtain further insight into the @xmath0 production mechanism .",
    "on the other hand we saw here , using a fokker - plank description for the later evolution of the distribution function @xmath113 in a hot environment , that these structures are largely washed out by subsequent elastic scattering of the @xmath0 with the hadrons in the medium .",
    "in addition , the large annihilation rate reduces the number of observable antiprotons by roughly two orders of magnitude relative to the initial production spectrum ; the exact magnitude of the absorption effect was found to depend sensitively on the choice of the @xmath0 formation time @xmath67 .",
    "we have also shown that meson ( in particular pion ) induced production channels contribute significantly to the final @xmath0 yield and should thus not be neglected .",
    "we were thus able to reproduce the total yield of the measured antiprotons in a simple model for the reaction dynamics without including , for example , medium effects on the hadron masses and cross sections @xcite .",
    "however , we must stress the strong sensitivity of the @xmath0 yield on various unknown parameters ( e.g. the @xmath0 formation time ) and on poorly controlled approximations ( e.g. the degree of population of extreme corners in phase space by the particles in the collision region ) , and emphasize the rapidly thermalizing effects of elastic final state interactions on the @xmath0 momentum spectrum . we conclude that turning subthreshold antiproton production in heavy ion collisions into a quantitative probe for medium properties and collective dynamics in hot and dense nuclear matter remains a serious challenge .",
