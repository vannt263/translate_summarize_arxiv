    "because of the limited accuracy of available functionals , density functional theory ( dft ) fails for a large number of correlated systems .",
    "there are numerous examples for which dft can not describe neither their ground state properties , nor their excitation properties .",
    "thus , in order to describe many - body effects arising in the strongly correlated systems containing for instance transition elements or @xmath3 electrons , theories were designed to take into account the interaction among correlated orbitals explicitly .",
    "the dft+@xmath0 method@xcite or the combination of dft with dynamical mean field theory method ( dft+dmft ) @xcite have been successfully applied to a large number of systems in the last twenty years . in particular , these methods have been particularly useful to study the ground state and the photoemission spectra of mott insulators such as bulk actinide@xcite and lanthanide oxide@xcite .",
    "for instance , to date dft+dmft is the only method to give a good description of photoemission spectra of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 cerium @xcite .",
    "however , in these frameworks and applications , the interaction among correlated orbitals , named @xmath0 , remained most often an input parameter .",
    "as a consequence , there is a stringent need to calculate the magnitude of the interaction @xmath0 , in order to recover a truly _ ab initio _ scheme .",
    "methods were then proposed to evaluate @xmath0 from first - principles .",
    "the constrained local density approximation ( clda ) method@xcite deduces the value of @xmath0 from the variation of energy with respect to the number of correlated electrons on an atom .",
    "later , cococcioni _ et al _ @xcite generalized this method to a non basis dependent scheme .",
    "finally , the constrained rpa method@xcite uses the linear response theory to compute the value of the screened interaction .",
    "screening processes corresponding to electron hole transitions among the correlated orbitals are however excluded from the calculation .",
    "indeed an exact many - body scheme would already contain all the screening processes associated to the degrees of freedom involved in the calculation .",
    "therefore , some transitions have to be disregarded to avoid double - counting .",
    "the crpa scheme very clearly defines which screening processes have to be taken into account .",
    "the method has been implemented in several electronic structure codes using the lmto@xcite , flapw@xcite , fplmto@xcite , plane wave@xcite and projector augmented - wave ( paw)@xcite methods and applied to different systems in the last few years@xcite .",
    "an important point emphasized in several works is that the calculation of the crpa screened interaction based on a previous dft calculation depends crucially on the definition of a many - body model@xcite .",
    "the many - body model is defined by a set of local orbitals together with the interactions among them .",
    "a crpa calculation of a model would require first the definition of a set of local orbitals , and second a consistently calculated screened interaction . whereas the choice of the angular momenta of the selected orbitals unambiguously defines the angular part of the local orbitals , the definition of the radial part is more subjected to variation .",
    "generally , it relies on the use of localized wannier functions , which are built as a unitary transform of kohn - sham orbitals in an energy window@xcite .",
    "the key point is to construct the model specific crpa screened interaction .",
    "it is especially important to study this dependence as a function of the localization of the wannier orbitals .",
    "indeed , correlated orbitals used in dft+@xmath0 and dft+dmft can be formulated as wannier orbitals with different energy windows@xcite depending on implementation choices .",
    "thus the coherence of the dft+@xmath0/dft+dmft calculations and of the crpa calculation can only be guaranteed if both methods use the same wannier functions .",
    "implementations of dft+@xmath0 in popular codes very often use atomic orbitals@xcite , whereas implementations of dft+dmft use wannier functions@xcite .",
    "it is thus expected that the value of @xmath0 used in dft+@xmath0 and dft+dmft should differ .",
    "some works indeed discuss the calculation of @xmath0 for a given energy window@xcite but there are no calculation of a screened interaction in the same basis as the one used in dft+@xmath0 codes . even for dft+dmft calculation ,",
    "the definition of an energy window is especially important for systems with entangled correlated bands@xcite .",
    "moreover and especially for very localized systems  such as mott insulators  , self - consistent calculations over @xmath0@xcite are desirable because the erroneous lda or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) band structures can not correctly describe the screening in these systems .",
    "the coherence of basis between the dft+@xmath0 and the crpa calculation is then of the utmost importance .",
    "this is in particular the case for cerium and uranium dioxide for which no self - consistent calculations of @xmath0 exist .",
    "in this work , we report an implementation of the crpa method using the paw method in the abinit package@xcite .",
    "the implementation is versatile enough to allow for the calculation of screened interaction in both the same wannier basis as our recent dft+dmft implementation@xcite and in atomic orbitals and as in our dft+@xmath0 implementation@xcite .",
    "then , we show that the self - consistent dft+@xmath0 calculation of the screened interaction in the crpa method in strongly correlated systems is essential to describe the static and dynamical screened interaction .",
    "we exemplify our study with two important applications : uo@xmath4 and cerium .",
    "as the crpa method is described in details elsewhere @xcite , we only sketch the most important points here .",
    "the screened interaction is in general a four index matrix that is defined as @xmath5 with @xmath6 the bare coulomb interaction and @xmath7 the indices of the correlated orbitals .    in this work ,",
    "the use projected wannier functions as defined in refs . and .",
    "similar wannier functions have been used in crpa calculations@xcite .",
    "we first introduce the auxiliary wavefunctions @xmath8 as @xmath9 for a given atomic site @xmath10 , we call @xmath11 the bloch transform of isolated atom kohn sham orbitals with projected angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 are kohn - sham orbitals for k - point @xmath14 , band index @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath8 is thus a weighted sum of kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "this sum extends over a given number of kohn sham orbitals that can be defined by an index range or alternatively by an energy window @xmath17 .",
    "the orthonormalization of @xmath8 leads to well defined wannier functions @xmath18 , unitarily related to @xmath13 . in the limit of a large number of kohn sham bands ,",
    "the projection in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tchi ] ) becomes complete and the wannier functions @xmath18 become equivalent to atomic orbitals @xmath11 .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 is very much similar to the coulomb integrals used in quantum chemistry , but with the screening of the frequency dependent crpa dielectric matrix , @xmath19 .",
    "this dielectric matrix can be expressed as a function of the crpa non - interacting polarizability @xmath20 and the bare interaction @xmath6 as ( in the matrix notation ) @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 contains all electron - hole screening processes except the ones that are internal to the correlated orbitals of the model .",
    "it can be conveniently written as @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pola ] ) , @xmath24 are band indices , @xmath25 are k - points in the brillouin zone and @xmath26 is the occupation number for band @xmath27 , spin @xmath16 and k - point @xmath28 .",
    "if the correlated bands in the model are completely isolated from the other ones , then we can assume that@xcite @xmath29 when ( @xmath30 ) and ( @xmath31 ) are both correlated bands and @xmath32 otherwise .",
    "for example , a model could define correlated orbitals as wannier orbitals constructed only from the @xmath3 bands .",
    "nevertheless , with this specific choice , the wannier orbitals have some weight on other orbitals : oxygen-@xmath33 for oxides@xcite or @xmath34 for pure metals .",
    "the intensity of this weight depends on the hybridization of @xmath3 orbitals with the other orbitals .",
    "this last definition of correlated orbitals is not the one used in most implementations of dft+@xmath0 in modern codes@xcite . in these implementations ,",
    "correlated orbitals are most often atomic orbitals which thus corresponds to wannier functions @xmath18 for a large window of energy@xcite .    if the bands are completely entangled or if one defines wannier functions @xmath18 from a larger energy window , then the preceding assumption of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pola0 ] ) can not be made@xcite and some authors have proposed the more general assumption@xcite : @xmath35 \\\\                     \\times                      \\left[\\sum_{m_2 } |\\bra\\psi^\\sigma_{n'\\mathbf{k'}}| w^\\sigma_{m_2\\vk'}\\ket|^2\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : weightpola}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] if the correlated bands are not entangled and if the wannier functions are defined from these correlated bands only , then eq .  ( [ eq : weightpola ] ) simply reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pola0 ] ) .",
    "fully screened coulomb interaction @xmath36 corresponds to @xmath32 .    in this work",
    ", we use an implementation of the calculation of the dielectric function in paw@xcite . from the screened interaction expressed in the kohn sham basis ,",
    "we compute the screened interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ummmm ] ) , using the wannier functions as defined in refs .   and  . the weight of wannier functions necessary for eq .",
    "( [ eq : weightpola ] ) is evaluated within paw following ref . .",
    "then , the values of the famous hubbard @xmath0 and hund @xmath37 are simply extracted by taking the average among the considered localized orbitals : @xmath38 @xmath39 note that this definition of @xmath0 is also sometimes referred to as the @xmath40 slater integral .",
    "we emphasize that this definition is different from the average of the diagonal elements of the coulomb interaction matrix @xmath41 ( see e.g ref . ) . in particular diagonal elements",
    "are usually larger , and thus @xmath42 .",
    "however our definition is coherent with the @xmath0 used in the dft+@xmath0 approach@xcite and physically describes the average interaction between electrons in all orbitals .",
    "appendix [ sec : udetails ] gives the details of the implementation and the peculiarities of the paw formalism for the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "appendix [ sec : appendix ] gives a benchmark of our implementation with respect to recent calculations on srvo@xmath43 .",
    "the calculation are performed within the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method as implemented in abinit@xcite .",
    "the valence states include @xmath44 for oxygen , @xmath45 for cerium and @xmath46 for uranium respectively .",
    "two projectors per angular momentum are used , and completeness of the projector basis is checked by increasing their number .",
    "the parameters of calculation are chosen such that the precision on the static values of @xmath0 and @xmath37 is better than 0.2 ev .",
    "for uo@xmath4 , we thus use a 4x4x4 k - point grid , and energy cutoffs for the wavefunctions , the dielectric function and the bare coulomb interaction are respectively 15 ha , 5 ha , and 35 ha . 100 bands are sufficient for the calculation of the polarisability . for cerium , we use a 8x8x8 k - point grid and energy cutoffs for the wavefunction , the dielectric function and the bare coulomb interaction are respectively 15 ha , 10 ha and 35 ha ( for large values of the volume , a 4x4x4 k - point grid was sufficient ) . for the static screened exchange @xmath37 in cerium ,",
    "a value of 120 ha was however necessary but a 4x4x4 k - point grid is sufficient as well as 100 bands for the calculation of the polarisability .",
    "this high value of the cutoff originates from the calculation of oscillator matrix elements in the paw formalism ( see appendix [ sec : udetails ] ) .",
    "a smearing of the kohn sham occupations of 0.1 ev is used . for all systems ,",
    "experimental structural parameters are used : 5.47  for uo@xmath4 , 4.83  for @xmath1 cerium , and 5.16  for @xmath2 cerium .    unless specified , all dft+@xmath0 calculations use the full localized limit ( fll ) double counting correction@xcite . a discussion on the role of the double counting correction is given in appendix [ app : dc ] .",
    "for uo@xmath4 , dft+@xmath0 are performed for simplicity in the ferromagnetic configuration , which requires a symmetry breaking@xcite and we use the correlated @xmath3 density matrix found in ref . .",
    "the goal of this section is to define models of correlation for uranium dioxide and cerium . for each model ,",
    "one thus defines an energy window  that encompasses at least the bands which have the same main character as the selected orbitals . from the definition of the window energy , wannier functions of the correlated orbitals",
    "are built according to the scheme of ref .  .",
    "from the choice of the correlated orbitals , the crpa polarizability is built by excluding some screening channels corresponding to correlated orbitals .",
    "we distinguish different ways to exclude the screening according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pola0 ] ) or to eq .",
    "( [ eq : weightpola ] ) .",
    ".different models for the description of correlation in uo@xmath4 . from the top to the bottom",
    ", the @xmath3 wannier function are expected to be more and more localized .",
    "for the first three model ( resp .",
    "last four models ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pola0 ] ) ( resp eq .",
    "( [ eq : weightpola ] ) ) is used to compute @xmath47 .",
    "the three models @xmath3-ext ( b@xmath48 ) ( b@xmath49 ) ( b@xmath50 ) use a fixed number of bands ( respectively 28 , 38 and 48 ) that corresponds to the energy windows given . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "whereas all results in tab . [",
    "tab : uo2.static ] and [ tab : cerium.static ] are obtained with the fll double counting correction@xcite , we give in this appendix results obtained with the around mean field ( amf ) double counting correction@xcite .",
    "this is _ a priori _ less justified than the fll double counting correction because in our dft+@xmath0 calculations electrons are not delocalized among all f - orbitals . for uranium dioxide ( resp . @xmath2",
    "cerium ) using the @xmath3-ext ( b@xmath48 ) ( resp .",
    "@xmath3-ext ( b@xmath51 ) ) model , we find @xmath52 = 4.5 ev ( resp .",
    "4.2 ev ) instead of 5.0 ev ( resp .",
    "5.9 ev ) for the fll double counting .",
    "these differences can be understood from the analytical expression of the dft+@xmath0 kohn sham potential in amf ( see e.g. ref . ):",
    "the hubbard bands  and especially the minority spin bands  are lowered in energy with respect to fll .",
    "it can thus be expected that the contribution of upper hubbard bands to the screening processes is larger , hence the lower value of @xmath0 .    for cerium ( with only one correlated electron ) , the shift of hubbard bands is -1.5 ev , and even larger for the minority bands .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is thus greatly reduced .",
    "moreover , the cerium dos hence obtained in amf would badly compare with experimental photoemission spectra@xcite . as the fll dos is better",
    ", we can roughly expect that the value of @xmath0 obtained in fll is better .",
    "however , and more generally , this comparison calls for a more general self - consistent scheme with a more justified double counting correction such as in the gw+dmft@xcite scheme .",
