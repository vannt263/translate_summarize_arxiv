    "<S> for every prime @xmath0 and integer @xmath1 we explicitly construct an abelian variety @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 such that for a suitable prime @xmath4 the group of quasi - isogenies of @xmath2 of @xmath4-power degree is canonically a dense subgroup of the @xmath3-th morava stabilizer group at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a variant of this result taking into account a polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by the recent construction of topological automorphic forms which generalizes topological modular forms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + for this , we prove some arithmetic results of independent interest : a result about approximation of local units in maximal orders of global skew - fields which also gives a precise solution to the problem of extending automorphisms of the @xmath0-divisible group of a simple abelian variety over a finite field to quasi - isogenies of the abelian variety of degree divisible by as few primes as possible . </S>"
