    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are called the _ shores _ of @xmath33 . throughout the rest of the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath0 does not contain universal vertices , where a _",
    "universal vertex _ in a bipartite graph is a vertex that is adjacent to all vertices in the opposite color class .",
    "this assumption , while does not cause loss of generality , leads to simpler statements and proofs .",
    "following @xcite , we endow @xmath27 by a partial order @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 equivalently , the same partial order can be defined as @xmath36 since @xmath37 . if we extend @xmath27 by adding two dummy elements @xmath38 and @xmath39 acting as bottom and top element respectively , the poset @xmath40 is a lattice known as the galois lattice of @xmath0 .",
    "the two dummy elements are respectively defined by @xmath41    in this paper we prove that the shape of @xmath42 can be used to characterize bdh graphs .",
    "more precisely , we show the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath0 be a connected bipartite graph and let @xmath43 be the transitive reduction of @xmath44 . then @xmath43 is a tree if and only if @xmath0 is a bdh graph",
    ".    otherwise stated : after deleting @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath42 is a tree - like poset .",
    "this is a very strong property : for instance , it allows efficient enumeration of linear extensions @xcite .",
    "the question of studying bipartite graphs ( binary relations ) whose galois lattice is tree - like ( arborescence - like in a sense ) was raised first in @xcite .",
    "here we completely solve the problem from a graph - theoretical view - point .",
    "we also give a direct proof that @xmath44 has dimension at most 3 , though this can be derived by known properties of planar posets  @xcite .",
    "although , as we show in section [ sec : indirect ] , theorem [ thm : main ] can be deduced with some extra work from other known results on graphs and hypergraphs ( by taking the longest dipath in diagram [ eq : diagram2 ] ) the proof we present here is direct and self - contained .",
    "the corpus of theoretical and algorithmic machinery on galois lattices would certainly allow a pure lattice theoretical development of the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , we prefer to present the result as much combinatorially as possible .",
    "for instance , a bipartite graph is the counterpart of the lattice theoretical notion of _ context induced by a binary relation _ and maximal bicliques are the graph theoretical counterparts of _ concepts _ in galois lattices @xcite . in this respect",
    "we prefer to look at the covering diagram of a poset as to a directed acyclic graph and to think of `` crowns '' as cycles in an undirected graph .",
    "this choice allows us from the one hand to make the paper very self - contained and on the other hand to elicit the purely combinatorial arguments behind our proofs . as an example consider lemma [ lem : htree1 ] .",
    "that easy result is also a rather straightforward consequence of the fact that the galois lattice of a sub - context of a given context can be order - embedded canonically into the galois lattice of the context so that the covering diagram of the former is the covering diagram of an induced subposet ( not necessarily a sublattice ) of the latter .",
    "the proof we give is nothing but than a specialization of the general arguments used in proposition 32 in @xcite , but has the advantage of avoiding more sophisticated notion that would remain otherwise unused throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "also notions such as _ join - irreducibility _ and _ meet - irreducibility _ will be briefly recalled and referred to when they come out and mostly from a diagrammatic approach , because what matters for our purposes is their graphical counterpart .",
    "we warn the reader that our results do not use assumptions about the context usually introduced under the clause `` without loss of generality '' , such as that the context is reduced or clarified . while this fact is not a gain of generality from a theoretical view - point it is surely a gain in algorithmic robustness and computational complexity .",
    "bdh graphs have very strong structural properties and some of them are highlighted in the characterization by bandelt and mulder @xcite recalled in theorem [ thm : bdhchar ] ( see also @xcite and the monograph @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , bdh graphs are related to other very well known classes of graphs : ptolemaic graphs and series parallel graphs .",
    "the relation between ptolemaic graphs and bdh graphs has been partially introduced above and will be further pursued in section [ sec : indirect ] .",
    "let us discuss here the relation with series parallel graphs .",
    "ellis - monaghan and sarmiento @xcite showed that the class of bipartite distance hereditary graphs is a nice nontrivial class of polynomially computable instances for the _ vertex - nullity interlace polynomial",
    "_ introduced by arratia , bollobs and sorkin in @xcite , under the name of _",
    "interlace polynomial_. the former authors achieved their result by exploiting a strong topological relationship between bdh graphs and series - parallel graphs . in this paper",
    "we prove another deep relation between the two classes , namely bdh graphs are _ fundamental graphs _ of series parallel graphs ( see section [ sec : encoding ] ) .",
    "this result leads to an implicit representation of the galois lattice of a bdh graph as a collection of paths in an arborescence .",
    "we further discuss this representation in section [ sec : encoding ] , where we exploit it to show how the galois lattice of a bdh graph , and the bdh graph itself , can be efficiently encoded .",
    "the encoding of the bdh graph requires @xmath45 space in the worst case , @xmath46 being the order of the graph , still allowing the retrieval of the neighborhood of any vertex in time linear in the size of the neighborhood .",
    "moreover , intersections of neighborhoods can be listed in optimal linear time in the size of the intersection , in the worst case .",

    "we prove a useful property of bdh graphs .",
    "such a property is then exploited in section [ sec : char ] to characterize bdh graphs through their galois lattice ",
    "the property is intimately related with fagin s results @xcite ( as it is discussed in section [ sec : indirect]). in section [ sec : encoding ] we show how the galois lattice of any bdh graph can be encoded as the containment relation among dipaths in an arborescence . in section [ sec : algorithms ]",
