    "nucleon form factors are of considerable importance , as they can give additional information on the internal structure of the nucleons .",
    "renewed interest in the form factors is due to new polarization transfer measurements   for the proton , that produced data at variance with respect to earlier rosenbluth data  @xcite .",
    "accurate measurements  @xcite of new generation revealed the existence of a discrepancy that can not be explained  @xcite with coulomb distortion effects .",
    "it has been suggested that two - photon contributions could be the source of the disagreement  @xcite , but to date the experimental situation is still under discussion ( see also  ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "two - photon corrections   and additional @xmath1 contributions  @xcite have been advocated to resolve this problem .",
    "a detailed discussion on the theoretical and experimental status of nucleon form factors can be found in two recent reviews  @xcite .    here , we reinvestigate the description of nucleon form factors within the goldstone - boson exchange ( gbe ) constituent - quark model ( cqm )  @xcite .",
    "the approach is complementary to field - theoretic ones , like e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , as it is valid for low and intermediate momentum transfers .",
    "the electromagnetic ( em ) ground state properties of the nucleon already were reproduced quite well  @xcite with the point - form spectator model ( pfsm ) applied to the gbe cqm . with the advent of newer and more precise data for the nucleon form - factor ,",
    "it becomes necessary to assess more carefully the predictive power of the pfsm construction and possible sources of indetermination  @xcite . in the last cortona meeting  @xcite , we presented arguments that translational invariance of the transition amplitude implies the presence of many - body contributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that in connection to these many - body effects certain ambiguities arise which can not be fully constrained by poincar invariance alone . here , we further constrain the pfsm construction by requiring charge normalization and time - reversal invariance of the elastic electromagnetic nucleon transition amplitude .",

    "the reduced matrix element of the pfsm em current between three constituent quarks with individual momenta @xmath2 and helicities @xmath3 reads  @xcite @xmath4 for the nucleon electromagnetic form - factors the transition amplitude between the incoming and outgoing baryon eigenstates is given by the following definition @xmath5 in the breit frame , the nucleon sachs form - factors are related to the transition amplitude @xmath6 according to the expressions @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the spin projection along the @xmath9-axis of the nucleon and @xmath10 the corresponding pauli spinors .    as has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a normalization factor @xmath11 appears in the pfsm current of ( [ eq : pfsm ] ) , which can be parametrized in the following way @xmath12 in this form @xmath13 and @xmath14 are free parameters which we consider in the range @xmath15 , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mass eigenvalues of the baryon states ( here , we restrict our investigation to the elastic case with @xmath18 ) .",
    "conversely , @xmath19 is the invariant mass of the free incoming three - quark system , where @xmath20 are internal momenta , and similarly for @xmath21 for the outgoing . obviously , the normalization factors so defined are all lorentz invariant . here",
    ", we further constrain the construction by adhering to additional global requirements for the em amplitudes .",
    "charge normalization requires @xmath22 ( for any @xmath14 values ) , because in  ( a ) only for this value the proton charge is recovered at zero momentum transfer .",
    "this result substantiates the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one can see that only when the exponent takes the @xmath22 value , one can recover a genuine one - body operator at zero momentum transfer . if we impose that the em - current amplitude is time - reversal invariant , then it has been demonstrated ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the third component of @xmath23 has to vanish identically in the breit frame . in  ( b ) we present the corresponding transition amplitude exhibiting an antisymmetric structure around the value @xmath24 . to obtain a vanishing amplitude the obvious choice clearly is the zero - crossing at @xmath24 , leading to the symmetric ( geometric ) factor @xmath25 however , the antisymmetric structure of the curves in  ( b ) allows to consider also other , equally valid , pfsm normalizations .",

    "we show the ratio of magnetic nucleon to standard dipole form factors in comparison to experiment .",
    "as one moves to higher @xmath0 momenta , one observes a broadening of the band between the curves @xmath27 and @xmath29 , indicating that the normalization factor effects mainly the higher momentum results .",
    "the predictions with @xmath27 ( full line ) exhibit a strong fall off above @xmath34gev@xmath35 following approximately the lower bounds of the experimental neutron data , but considerably underestimating the proton data .",
    "the dashed line , representing the results with @xmath29 , exhibit an overpredicton of the experimental data .",
    "we also have performed a one - parameter `` best fit '' ( denoted by the dash - dotted line ) to the experimental data of the dipole ratios @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath38gev@xmath35 momentum transfer .",
    "the value @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : facgen ] ) produces a theoretical curve that lies still below the experimental data for the proton , while it is already above for the neutron .",
    "these reults are denoted as @xmath40 and represented by the dash - dotted lines in figs .",

    "the two curves with @xmath41 and @xmath29 envelop the experimental data in most cases , while the curve with @xmath40 lies in - between .",
    "in   we show the ratio of the electric and magnetic proton form - factor ( left ) and the ratio of the electric proton form - factor to standard dipole parametrization ( right ) .",
    "again , the theoretical spread enlarges with increased momentum transfer .",
    "the dash - dotted line follows the experimental values and is congruent to latest data with the asymmetric beam - target experiment by jones et al .",
    "note that this line was obtained with the same @xmath40 , which was determined previously . to further decrease the theoretical spread",
    ", one needs to find additional conditions that further constrain the construction of pfsm operators .",
    "however , for the time being one could assume the band between the two curves as an estimate for the theoretical uncertainty of the pfsm construction of the nucleon em form - factors .",
    "in this contribution we have reconsidered the construction of em operators in the pfsm formalism .",
    "the spectator - like nature of the construction implies that only one quark is explicitly coupled to the current operator , but nevertheless the operator contains many - body effects .",
    "such many - body effects appear in the kinematics and in the occurrence of a normalization factor that is explicitly required by the theory .",
    "the specific expression for the factor , however , is not completely determined since poincar invariance and proton - charge normalization alone are not sufficient to uniquely determine the current - operator .",
    "time - reversal invariance produces an important additional constraint that further restricts the possible choices , but still allows for a residual indetermination .",
    "this spread is zero at zero - momentum transfer and increases at higher @xmath0-values .",
    "we have estimated the corresponding theoretical uncertainty and found that it remains reasonably small , at least for the em form - factors of the nucleon .",
    "we have finally determined an optimal choice utilizing one single free parameter , obtaining results overall in good agreement with the experimental data .",
