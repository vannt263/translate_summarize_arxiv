    ", this time can exceed the duration of the laser pulse , @xmath4 , by a few orders of magnitude which is due to the significant drift velocity in the pulse .",

    "similar modifications apply also to other formulas in this section .    in closing this section ,",
    "let us note that in order to calculate the thomson amplitude , eq .  , the first equation of the system   is not necessary",
    ". it is included , however , to describe the classical trajectory and the reduced velocity and acceleration not only as functions of the phase @xmath17 , but also as functions of the real time @xmath76 .",
    "it appears that from the practical point of view such an expansion of the system of ordinary differential equations marginally increases the computational time .",
    "moreover , it is well - known that the newton - lorentz equations with the electric and magnetic fields of the forms and can be solved in quadratures .",
    "however , this does not lead to significant simplifications as the numerical evaluation of integrals is equally time - consuming as the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations . having this in mind",

    "namely , it depends only on the geometry of the process and , except for the direction of propagation of the pulse , it is independent of the laser field parameters responsible for the dynamical aspects of the process . with this definition",
    "we find that @xmath93 or @xmath94 as it follows from the thomson theory , the frequency of the generated radiation can be arbitrary large . on the other hand , for the quantum compton process the frequency must fulfill the boundaries @xcite @xmath95 at least for an arbitrary laser pulse for which the plane - wave - fronted approximation applies .",

    "the comparison of the two is shown in the upper panel .",
    "we see that the spectra are very similar except that the classical one is blue - shifted with respect to its quantum equivalent , and that both differ in amplitude .",

    "however , if we present the classical distribution such that its frequency @xmath89 is scaled to @xmath91 , according to eq .",

    "the agreement is up to a multiplicative factor which , for the whole range of the considered frequencies , is roughly equal to 2 .",

    "the differences between the quantum and classical dynamics for these processes are hidden in the pre - factor , @xmath121 , which is unknown ; it appears , however , from our numerical analysis that it is a smooth function of its arguments , as compared to the compton and thomson distributions that are , in general , rapidly changing functions . for this reason , in a frequency interval containing a few oscillations of these distributions , one can write that @xmath122 this means that the compton and thomson theories give similar results in the sense that after rescaling the thomson frequency and multiplying the thomson distribution by a constant factor both distributions become almost identical .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ shiftct20130629a ] .    as mentioned above , the exact form of the factor @xmath121 in eq .",

    "these properties enable for a fast theoretical analysis of spectral and temporal characteristics of radiation generated during the interaction of electrons with intense laser pulses .",
    "namely , in order to determine these properties , one has to apply a rather complicated and numerically demanding formalism of the strong - field qed . for sufficiently intense laser pulses ,",
    "such an analysis becomes extremely time - consuming as distributions of generated radiation are very rapidly oscillating functions .",
    "this means that , in order to determine them properly , one has to perform the calculation of quantum probability amplitudes for densely distributed sample points .",
    "the scaling law allows to speed up this procedure significantly , with some limitations concerning polarization properties of emitted radiation and spin dynamics of electrons interacting with strong laser pulses , as it is going to be discussed below . indeed , to determine the slowly changing factor @xmath121 it is sufficient to calculate quantum and classical amplitudes for sparsely distributed sample points .",
    "having determined @xmath121 , one can perform computationally much less time - consuming ( although not fully appropriate for very intense laser pulses , as it will follow shortly from our analysis ) classical investigations of the process .",
    "these results multiplied by @xmath121 give a good estimation of quantum distributions , that can be compared afterward with experimental results .",
    "let us also remark that another possibility of determining approximately @xmath121 ( however , in our opinion less accurate ) has been suggested in ref .",
    "it consists in relating this factor to the ratio of the corresponding distributions for the monochromatic plane wave ( see , eq .",
    "( 59 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "note that the compton scattering has a much richer structure than its classical counterpart .",
    "first of all , it depends on the electron spin degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , if the laser pulse is linearly polarized in the scattering plane the thomson theory predicts no radiation with polarization perpendicular to this plane , which is in contrast to the compton theory .",
    "( for more works on polarization effects in thomson scattering , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite ; the polarization effects in compton scattering were analyzed more closely in refs .",
    "the agreement between both theories occurs when , for compton scattering , the spin - flipping processes as well as the emission of radiation polarized perpendicularly to the scattering plane take place with small probabilities .",
    "for this reason , the frequency scaling law has to be more specific . in the following ,",
    "we shall demonstrate that , as long as the classical theory predicts the emission of radiation , its distribution is similar to the quantum one for spin - conserved processes .",
    "since the compton and thomson theories are relativistically invariant , in the remaining part of this paper we restrict our numerical analysis to the reference frame of the incident electron .      for long laser pulses , the four - momentum conservation condition , eq .  , is well satisfied with significant probability amplitudes only for an integer @xmath81",
    ". therefore , let us consider the long pulse with @xmath110 . in fig .",

    "as one can see , the spin - flipping processes marginally contribute to the total emitted energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that for all these intervals the thomson and the no - spin - flipping compton distributions are similar in the sense discussed above , although they are calculated for frequency domains that are very much separated from each other .",
    "for instance , in the bottom left panel the compton and thomson processes are calculated for @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",

    "<S> , we identify that both spin and polarization effects are responsible for differences between classical and quantum results . </S>",
    "<S> the same frequency scaling applies to angular distributions and to temporal power distributions of emitted radiation , which we illustrate numerically . </S>"
