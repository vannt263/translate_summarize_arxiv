    "the btev experiment is designed to carry out a comprehensive program of precision measurements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix as they relate to cp violation in the b - quark sector .",
    "in addition , the experiment will conduct a wide array of measurements on rare decays in both the bottom and charm quark sector .",
    "these measurements will provide perhaps the most stringent tests of the ckm description of cp violation as well as provide complementary probes to the lhc for the presence of physics which is not described by the standard model ( `` new physics '' ) .",
    "the first indication of a non - zero value for @xmath1 as measured in @xmath2 decays was presented by cdf  @xcite .",
    "the b - factory experiments , babar and belle , which operate on the @xmath3 have improved significantly on this measurement , and now have unambiguous confirmation of a non - zero value for @xmath1  @xcite . despite their impressive achievements , construction of a dedicated @xmath0-physics experiment at a hadron collider holds several key advantages .",
    "first , the production cross - section is @xmath410,000 times larger at the tevatron than at the @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , @xmath5 machines operating at the @xmath3 can not perform cp violation measurements in the @xmath6 system , whose decays can be used to probe the angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 . given these advantages , @xmath9-factories operating at the @xmath3 ( at a luminosity of @xmath10 @xmath11 s@xmath12 ) can not compete with a hadron collider , even on the time scale of 2007 .    in @xmath13 collisions at @xmath14=2 tev ,",
    "@xmath0 quark pairs exhibit a high degree of correlation .",
    "in particular , when one @xmath0 quark has large pseudorapidity ( @xmath15 ) , the other @xmath0-quark is also preferentially produced at large @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "both @xmath0-quarks are often either both forward , or both backward , with respect to the direction of the proton beam .",
    "the advantages of this are two fold .",
    "first , at large @xmath15 , the @xmath0-hadron is boosted with @xmath16 , which results in larger decay lengths .",
    "these larger decay lengths aid in separating the @xmath0-daughter particles from those in the interaction vertex .",
    "not only does this improve the overall detection efficiency , but it allows btev to trigger on @xmath0-hadron decays at the lowest level of the trigger .",
    "unlike cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite which are central detectors , btev  @xcite is a forward detector optimized for @xmath9 physics .",
    "the detector consists of an array of 31 pixel modules inside a dipole magnet centered on the interaction region .",
    "tracking beyond the pixel system is provided by 7 tracking stations which are each a combination of silicon - strip detectors for the forward high - occupancy region and straw - tube drift chambers at larger angles .",
    "downstream of the last tracking chamber is a pbwo@xmath17 electromagnetic calorimeter and a muon detection system .",
    "the rich is situated between the sixth and seventh straw / silicon tracking chambers .",
    "the rich is used for separating charge particle species from one another .",
    "when a particle exceeds the speed of light in a dielectric medium , cerenkov photons are emitted at a characteristic angle ( called the cerenkov angle ) given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the speed of the particle relative to the speed of light in the radiating medium , @xmath20 is the index of refraction of the medium and @xmath21 is the cerenkov angle . by using the momentum measured in the tracking system and measuring the cerenkov angle , the particle type ( ie .",
    ", the mass of the radiating particle ) can be deduced .",
    "to separate kaons from pions in two - body @xmath9 decays , we require that the rich provides at least 3@xmath22 separation between kaons and pions up to 70 gev / c . at the low momentum end , the rich is used for flavor tagging .",
    "these particles peak at lower momentum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kaon_mom_frac ] , and therefore the low momentum cut - off is set by the spectrometer acceptance , which drops off around 2.5 gev/@xmath23 .    to achieve particle separation over this large momentum range a heavy gas is required .",
    "we chose @xmath24 because of it is among the heaviest gases which has high transparency with respect to visible light and is a gas at room temperature .",
    "this gas has also been used in a number of other experiments  @xcite as well as lhcb  @xcite .",
    "no gas can provide kaon / proton separation below about 9 gev , and we therefore are designing a 1 cm thick @xmath25 liquid radiator system .",
    "the cerenkov angle as a function of momentum for the two radiators are shown in fig .",
    "[ thetac ] .",
    "the gas radiator has n=1.00138 , whereas the liquid has n=1.24 , resulting in vastly different cerenkov angles and hence momentum coverage .    a cartoon of the baseline rich for btev is shown in fig .",
    "[ btev_rich ] .",
    "the system consists of a 1 cm @xmath25 liquid radiator , followed by @xmath263 m of @xmath27 gas . at the back end of the rich",
    ", two spherical mirrors , each tilted by 15@xmath28 , focus cerenkov photons from the gas radiator onto one of two arrays of hybrid photodiodes ( hpds ) located on either side of the btev dipole magnet .",
    "the arrays consist of about 1000 hpd s , each with 163 channels .",
    "photons from the liquid radiator are detected directly by arrays of photomultiplier tubes which cover the walls of the rich vessel and are tilted at @xmath29 so that photons strike perpendicularly , on average .",
    "a total of about 5000 pmts are required .",
    "because of the large difference in cerenkov angle between the gas and liquid radiator , gas photons are detected almost entirely in the hpd s and liquid photons in the pmt s .    at 70 gev / c ,",
    "the difference in @xmath21 between kaon and pions is only 0.4 mrad , and therefore , to achieve at least 3 @xmath22 separation , we must keep the total uncertainty in the cerenkov angle ( @xmath22 ) below about 0.130 mrad .",
    "detailed simulations have been carried out , and they indicate that we expect to detect @xmath30 photons per track . after removing photons which are consistent with more than one track",
    ", we expect about 60 - 65 photons per track on average .",
    "this implies that the single photon angular resolution must be kept below 1 mrad .",
    "the primary contributions to the intrinsic angular resolution are from photon position resolution , emission point uncertainty and chromatic uncertainty . in collaboration with dep",
    "we have developed a 8.3 cm diameter , 163 channel hpd which will contribute an uncertainty of 0.51 mrad to the cerenkov angle uncertainty .",
    "the emission point uncertainty contributes another 0.51 mrad uncertainty .",
    "the chromatic uncertainty yields a shallow minimum at 0.37 mrad if we restrict our wavelength detection to larger than 280 nm . all together , we expect to achieve @xmath260.8 mrad uncertainty on the cerenkov angle per photon , or @xmath31rad per track . the expected separation ( in number of sigma s ) between kaons and pions as a function of momentum is shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ thetac ] .",
    "the liquid radiator extends the coverage for kaon / proton separation down to the low momentum cutoff of the btev spectrometer ( @xmath262 gev / c ) . for the liquid radiator ,",
    "the difference in kaon - proton cerenkov angle is about 5.3 mrad at 9 gev .",
    "we therefore are required to keep the cerenkov angle resolution below about 1.7 mrad per track . to determine the expected number of detected photons , we simulated a photodection system consisting of large arrays of single anode pmts along the walls of the rich tilted at an angle of 60@xmath28",
    ". we also included the shadowing produced by mu - metal tubes which will likely be necessary to cope with the residual magnetic field of the interaction region magnet .",
    "we simulated both 2 in . and 3 in .",
    "diameter tubes . the 3 in .",
    "diameter tubes provide sufficient resolution and are more cost effective .",
    "the simulation shows that for a 3 in .",
    "diameter pmt , we would expect to detect about 15 photoelectrons , and , with this granularity , the cerenkov angle uncertainty per photon is about 6.5 mrad .",
    "this dominates over the chromatic and emission point uncertainty , and therefore the 3 inch tube is our baseline choice for detecting photons from the liquid radiator .",
    "we expect to obtain a total uncertainty in the cerenkov angle of 1.7 mrad per track .",
    "the expected angular uncertainties for the gas and liquid radiator systems are summarized in table  [ angular_resolution ] .",
    ".the expected cernkov angle uncertainties from various sources and the total uncertainty for the gas and liquid rich systems . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     photo - electrons ( pe ) produced from the hpd photo - cathode are accelerated by a 20 kv potential and impinge upon a silicon - pixel array .",
    "the pes are cross - focused and demagnified by a factor of four using two focusing electrodes operating at 19.89 and 15.6 kv . the photoelectrons deposit all of their energy in the silicon pixel , giving rise to a signal of 5000 electrons .",
    "the hpds will be read out with a custom asic ( @xmath32 ) being developed in collaboration with ide as norway .",
    "the asic is a 64-channel circuit featuring a low noise front end amplifier capable of achieving a noise of @xmath26700 electrons , a shaper and a comparator .",
    "thresholds for each channel can be fine - tuned via an initialization sequence .",
    "each channel has binary output ( on or off ) .",
    "to reach this low noise level , the front end is not clocked but rather is always active after it is initialized .",
    "one result of this feature is that after a channel is hit , it requires about 200 ns for the front end to return to its baseline level .",
    "since the tevatron will have a beam crossing every 132 ns , a hit channel is unavailable for the next beam crossing .",
    "the hpd pixel occupancy was simulated at an instantaneous luminosity of @xmath33 @xmath11 s@xmath12 and the results show that the number of channels per hpd with hits in two consecutive beam crossings is less than 10% in the busiest hpd . in the busiest 12 hpds , the rate of consecutive hits is approximately 2 - 3% and outside this region it is well below 1% .",
    "we therefore are confident that the occupancy is low enough that inefficiency due to hits in consecutive beam crossings is a non - issue . a more detailed report on the performance of the hpd s is given in the references  @xcite .",
    "the pmts will most likely be read out with a similar chip to the @xmath34 , modified to deal with the larger pmt signal .",
    "we have simulated both the gas and liquid radiator systems .",
    "one measure of the performance of the gas system is to compare the efficiency for tagging both pions in @xmath35 versus the cross - efficiency for assigning one or more of the of the pions to be a kaon .",
    "the results of the simulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ eff_vs_fake_pipi_2minbias ] .",
    "the study indicates that we can achieve a @xmath36 efficiency of 80% ( 90% ) while keeping the @xmath37 misidentification rate at 5% ( 12% ) .    since the separation between pions and kaons increases as the number of b - daughter tracks increase ( lower average momentum per track )",
    ", it is clear that the gas portion of the btev rich will provide excellent @xmath38 separation .",
    "the liquid radiator system was also simulated using @xmath39 events .",
    "the resulting proton fake rate versus kaon efficiency is shown in fig .",
    "[ eff_vs_fake_kp ] .",
    "the analysis was performed using a full geant simulation with 0 and 2 ( poisson distributed ) minimum - bias events added into each event .",
    "we conclude that we can achieve @xmath2680% kaon efficiency while rejecting @xmath2685% of the protons . a study to assess the impact on flavor tagging",
    "was conducted , and our simulations indicated that this system can improve the flavor tagging for @xmath6 by 25% and by 10% for @xmath40 .",
    "this improvement comes mainly from improved rejection of protons faking kaons below 9 gev / c , where neither the kaon nor proton produce cerenkov radiation in the gas .",
    "the significantly larger improvement in @xmath6 over @xmath40 is attributed to the large flavor tagging efficiency for same - side kaon tags over same - side pion tags .    in summary",
    ", we plan to construct a rich detector which includes both gas and liquid radiator subsystems .",
    "the gas radiator system uses a @xmath27 gas radiator and hpds for photodetection .",
