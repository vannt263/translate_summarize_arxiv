    "calculation of hadron masses constitutes a basic part in virtually all problems of lattice qcd simulations .",
    "a quantity always examined in such calculations is the effective mass @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of a plateau in @xmath1 as a function of time @xmath2 is regarded as a dual measure for the statistical quality of data and the minimum time separation beyond which the ground state dominates . in this way",
    "the plateau is used as a guide in the choice of the time interval for a global @xmath0 fitting to extract hadron masses from propagators . in practice , however , a long plateau has rarely been seen . even in the best previous efforts toward high statistics",
    "simulations@xcite , effective masses , particularly for @xmath3 meson and the nucleon , almost always deviate from a plateau beyond error bars after 5 or 6 times slices .",
    "ensuing uncertainties in the choice of the fitting range and fitted values of hadron masses have represented a severe hindrance factor in attempts toward high precision determination of hadron masses , especially for light hadrons@xcite .    in this report",
    "we present an analysis on the origin of this problem .",
    "our study is based on hadron propagators for the wilson quark action at @xmath4 evaluated on 1000 quenched gauge configurations on a @xmath5 lattice at @xmath6 , which were generated with the 5-hit pseudoheatbath algorithm at 2000 sweep intervals .",
    "the central value @xmath7 has been chosen to facilitate a comparison with previous high statistics studies@xcite which employ up to 400 configurations for the same spatial size@xcite or a larger size of @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this calculation is one of the first qcd runs carried out by the jlqcd collaboration on vpp500/80 at kek which started operation in january 1995 .",
    "the machine consists of 80 processing elements ( pe s ) , each with the peak speed of 1.6gflops and 256mbytes of memory , connected by a crossbar switch .",
    "our run used 64 processors , on which our code for heatbath and red / black minimal residual solver sustained the speed of @xmath9 gflops / pe . the configuration generation of 2000 sweeps and a calculation of standard meson and baryon propagators for the point and wall sources on the final configuration was made in about 30 minutes , so that the entire run took about 20 days to complete .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] we show the effective mass for @xmath10 , @xmath3 and nucleon ( @xmath11 ) obtained with the point(open circles ) or the wall ( filled circles ) source at @xmath7 or @xmath12 , which roughly corresponds to strange quark mass .",
    "a striking feature observed in these plots is the presence of fluctuations which exceed the level of one standard deviation after a few time slices even for @xmath10 and with 1000 configurations .",
    "in fact it is possible to understand this behavior by a simple statistical analysis . to show this ,",
    "let @xmath13 be the average for a hadron propagator over @xmath11 independent configurations , and @xmath14 be the true propagator . according to the central limit theorem",
    ", the difference @xmath15 obeys the distribution , @xmath16\\propto \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{n}{2}\\sum_{t , t ' } \\delta g(t)c^{-1}(t , t')\\delta g(t')\\right ] , \\label{eq : distribution}\\ ] ] where the covariance matrix @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 let us introduce a normalized covariance matrix @xmath19 and denote the eigenvalues and normalized eigenvectors of @xmath20 by @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 the temporal lattice size .",
    "an eigenvector decomposition of the averaged propagator leads to the formula , @xmath25 where , according to ( [ eq : distribution ] ) , @xmath26 are independent gaussian random numbers .    given a model of the true propagator @xmath27 and a measured value of the covariance matrix , this formula allows us to generate `` simulated '' samples of the averaged propagator @xmath13 by generating a set of @xmath24 gaussian random numbers @xmath28 .    for the model of @xmath27",
    "we take a double hyperbolic cosine form , @xmath29 where the masses and residues are determined by a @xmath0 fit of the measured propagator over @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we show four examples of effective mass for @xmath10 and @xmath3 for the point source calculated from `` simulated '' propagators ( solid curves ) .",
    "dotted lines represent values for the model ( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "these examples clearly demonstrate that fluctuations as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] are a typical occurrence .",
    "indeed some of the examples are amusingly similar to the measured value .",
    "let us add a remark that the diagonal of the covariance matrix is expected to behave as @xmath31 with @xmath32 for @xmath10 and @xmath3 and @xmath33 for @xmath11@xcite , with which our data are consistent . combined with ( [ eq : eigendecom ] ) this explains why the magnitude of fluctuation of @xmath34 increases rapidly for @xmath3 and @xmath11 toward large times , while it stays roughly constant for @xmath10 .",
    "we now reexamine the concept of a plateau in the light of the above analysis .",
    "let us define a plateau over the time interval @xmath35 by the condition that @xmath1 over this interval falls within a band of width @xmath36 centered at @xmath37 , _",
    "@xmath38 for @xmath39 . to calculate the probability for the occurrence of such a plateau",
    ", we make a change of variable @xmath40\\to p[m_{\\rm eff}(t_1),\\cdots , m_{\\rm eff}(t_2)]$ ] in ( [ eq : distribution ] ) , defining @xmath41 ( effects of the periodic boundary condition are small in the numerical results below ) . the probability is then given by an integral of @xmath42 $ ] over @xmath43 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we plot the probability of finding a plateau of length @xmath44 for @xmath10 and @xmath3 calculated with the measured covariance matrix for @xmath7 for the case of the wall source .",
    "we fix @xmath45 , since we have chosen the ground state mass @xmath37 by a @xmath0 fit with a single hyperbolic cosine over @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath47 we choose one ( open symbols ) or two ( filled symbols ) standard deviation of @xmath1 at @xmath48 .",
    "values for @xmath3 for @xmath49 are not shown because of the poor quality of the covariance matrix for large times .",
    "this figure shows that one _ should not _ expect to see a plateau at the level of one standard deviation even for @xmath10 : the probability drops below 50% after 2 time slices . allowing for a deviation of two standard deviations , a plateau of length 10 for @xmath10 ( @xmath50 units in terms of the correlation length @xmath51 ) becomes probable , while for @xmath3 the probability decreases to @xmath52% already at @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these features are consistent with actual examples of effective mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , and also with those of previous high statistics simulations@xcite",
    ".    we should emphasize that the pattern of fluctuations of effective mass does not change when one increases the number of configurations @xmath11 , except that the magnitude scales down as @xmath55 .",
    "at the same time statistical errors estimated for @xmath34 also decreases as @xmath55 . in this sense",
    "higher statistics does not lead to a longer or better plateau .",
    "in other words we can ask for such an improvement only within a fixed magnitude of the absolute error ( _ e.g. , _ 1% of mass ) .",
    "let us add that the use of larger spatial volumes and improved operators having a larger coupling to the ground state also help to obtain a better plateau only in the latter sense .",

    "in fact if one repeats a simulation with a different sequence of random numbers the effective mass will generally exhibit a plateau at some other time interval at a different value .",
    "this indicates that it is more reasonable to take the minimum time @xmath60 at the time slice where the dominance of the ground state is reasonably ensured ( _ e.g. , _ by the overlap of @xmath34 for the point and wall sources ) , and to extend the fitting range to large times as long as statistical fluctuations do not become unacceptably large , without resorting to the presence of plateau .",
    "the value of correlated @xmath0 should tell whether the choice is reasonable .",
    "of course the fitted values of hadron masses vary depending on the choice of the interval .",
    "however , this is an uncertainty which can only be reduced by an improved measurement of hadron propagators .    in table",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] we present hadron masses obtained by a correlated @xmath0 fit over the interval @xmath61 with a single hyperbolic cosine for @xmath10 and @xmath3 and with a single exponential for @xmath11 .",
    "errors correspond to an increase of @xmath0 by one . for @xmath10 and @xmath3 our results obtained with the point and",
    "wall sources are mutually in agreement . for @xmath7 previous results from the qcdpax collaboration@xcite and from the los alamos group@xcite are consistent with ours , while those from ape are higher .",
    "the case of nucleon is problematical .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 fit is not very stable and that the point and wall results do not agree within the error .",
    "effort toward improving baryon operators will be needed for a precise determination of baryon masses even in the region of strange quark .",
