    "thus , chaotic dynamics can magnify small scale fluctuations and justify the existence of macroscopic variables like entropy and temperature , which are of central importance in an analysis based on non  equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the work presented here is to study the `` melting transition '' in a microplasma model , using standard methods , as well as certain recently  developed techniques for chaos detection , such as the _ smaller alignment index _ ( sali ) @xcite and its extension to the so  called _ generalized alignment index _ ( gali ) @xcite .",
    "this latter approach is based on geometrical aspects of the microscopic dynamics and has significant computational advantages over more classical indicators based either on local dynamics , such as the lyapunov exponents , or statistical properties , such as the mean temperature or the kolmogorov ",
    "sinai entropy .",
    "in fact , the use of these novel indices often constitutes an improvement of several orders of magnitude in cpu and dynamical time for the identification of the chaotic or ordered nature of single orbits @xcite .",
    "the utility of sali ( or gali ) methods in detecting dynamical regime changes in few  particle hamiltonian systems @xcite is due to their sensitivity in tracing out the geometrical properties of the tangent dynamics of the flow .",
    "thus , they provide accurate information about regime changes when important parameters of the system are varied .",
    "for example , the existence of `` sticky '' regions and the occurrence of slow diffusion in weakly chaotic domains is detectable and the distinction between order and strongly chaotic motion is easily made by these methods @xcite . in the case of",
    "fully developed chaotic motion , sali is particularly efficient , since it decays exponentially as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the two largest lyapunov exponents @xcite , while for ordered orbits sali@xmath8const.@xmath9 .",
    "the system we consider here consists of @xmath10 interacting particles described by a hamiltonian function of the form @xmath11 where the kinetic energy part @xmath12 is quadratic in the generalized momenta @xmath13 and the potential energy @xmath14 is a function of its generalized position coordinates @xmath15 . in the case of confined systems , one takes @xmath16 as the sum of two terms : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 represents the potential of the trap ( being a smooth positive function ) , while @xmath19 accounts for the interactions amongst the @xmath10 particles . the fact that @xmath10 is a finite number classifies the system as `` small '' , in contrast to a `` large '' thermodynamic system ( where one lets @xmath10 and the volume @xmath16 tend to infinity in such a way that @xmath20 is a finite real constant ) @xcite",

    "the characteristic discontinuities or singularities in thermodynamic functions or their derivatives , which is the signature of a phase transition in large systems would now appear as steep but continuous changes in their thermodynamic functions or their derivatives @xcite .",
    "phase transitions in small systems , have also been associated , quite recently , with certain topology changes in configuration space @xcite .",
    "these developments are stemming from earlier work on hamiltonian systems exhibiting chaotic instabilities associated with singular behaviour of their configuration  space curvature fluctuations at their phase transition point @xcite .",

    "our model hamiltonian system describes a microplasma characterized by long range ( non shielded ) coulomb interactions described by the potential @xmath19 .",
    "the microplasma is confined in a penning trap given by the potential @xmath18 and our aim is to study the motion of its ions as the energy increases .",
    "the system evolves , in general , in 3 spatial dimensions and contains a relatively small number of ions for which the tracking of individual trajectories is numerically as well as experimentally feasible @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that lyapunov exponents have already been used to investigate spatially extended plasmas @xcite as well as 1dimensional wave  particle plasma models @xcite .",
    "moreover , as gaspard @xcite has demonstrated , for a realistic hamiltonian model in 3 spatial dimensions containing a relatively small number of ions , the long range nature of the coulomb interaction @xmath19 makes the maximum lyapunov exponents behave differently in microplasmas than in many ",
    "particle systems with short  range interactions , such as a hard  ball fluid or systems with shielded ionic interactions ( yukawa potentials ) . a detailed analysis of the differences between shielded ( yukawa  like ) and unshielded coulomb potentials can be found in the book by baus and tejero @xcite . indeed , in microplasmas composed of more than a few dozen of ions , the behavior of the maximum lyapunov exponent , especially in the `` gas phase '' , was explained following purely statistical mechanics arguments @xcite .",

    "the calculation of lyapunov exponents spectra for our system is presented in sec .",

    "let us consider a microplasma of @xmath10 ions of equal mass @xmath21 and electric charge @xmath22 in a penning trap with electrostatic potential @xmath23 and constant magnetic field along the @xmath24 direction with a vector potential of the form @xmath25    then , the hamiltonian of the full system is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the position of the @xmath28th ion , @xmath29 is the euclidean distance between the @xmath28th and @xmath30th ions and @xmath31 is the vacuum permittivity . in the penning trap ,",
    "the ions are subjected to a harmonic confinement in the @xmath24 direction with frequency @xmath32 while in the perpendicular direction ( due to the cyclotron motion ) they rotate with frequency @xmath33 .",

    "the ions are trapped in bounded motion under the condition that @xmath48 the trap is called prolate if @xmath49 , isotropic if @xmath50 and oblate if @xmath51 .",
    "so , the motion is quasi 1dimensional in the limit @xmath52 and quasi 2dimensional in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 direction is a symmetry axis and hence the @xmath54 component of the angular momentum @xmath55 is conserved , being thus , a second integral of the motion .",
    "we suppose from now on that the angular momentum is equal to zero ( i.e. @xmath56 ) and that the motion is studied in the larmor rotating frame .    in @xcite , it was shown that the motion of the ions governed by hamiltonian is generally very sensitive to initial conditions and has at least one positive maximum lyapunov exponent , while a first study of its dependence on the energy , number of ions and trap geometry was also presented . at low kinetic energies , where the microplasma forms an ion crystal ,",
    "chaos is considerably reduced , since the motion is quasi ",
    "harmonic around stable equilibrium configurations . on the other hand , at high temperatures ( or kinetic energies ) , the maximum lyapunov exponent decreases , as coulomb interactions become negligible and the microplasma forms a thermal cloud of nearly independent ions moving throughout the full extent of the harmonic potential of the trap .",
    "finally , for intermediate values of the energy , there is a regime of chaotic behavior which becomes wider as the number of ions increases .",
    "it is in this regime that the maximum lyapunov exponent attains a peak , whose value increases as a function of the number of ions .",
    "a crucial aspect related to our work is that of the geometry of the trap .",
    "as has been demonstrated in @xcite for prolate traps the maximum lyapunov exponent ( and therefore the k - s entropy of the system ) show a distinctively smoother increase in comparison to the oblate traps in the energy values interval from @xmath57 ( its minimum ) to @xmath58 ( its maximum ) .",
    "the transition of interest for our analysis is taking place within a small interval of energies at the beginning , i.e. just after @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the slower the increase of the function @xmath59 the higher the resolution required and the more accurate ( and time  consuming ) the numerical computation needed .",
    "of course , if one argues in analogy to the standard phase transition theory , the dimensionality of the problem makes it easier to detect transitions in two or three spatial dimensions . but",
    "systems with long range interactions may still exhibit a transition even in one dimension .",
    "this justifies the choice of small @xmath60 adopted in the present paper as being both physically challenging and numerically tractable .      at zero temperature ,",
    "the system freezes at a crystalline state ( see @xcite and in particular refs . [",
    "20 ]  [ 25 ] therein ) reminiscent of wigner crystals @xcite . in that case",
    ", the ion crystal is composed of several concentric rings for the case of an oblate ( quasi 2dimensional ) trap or a single line of ions in the case of a prolate ( quasi 1dimensional ) trap .",
    "as temperature rises slightly above zero , the ions execute quasi ",
    "periodic motion about stable periodic orbits moving around their equilibrium position .",
    "this is the regime where stable normal modes of vibration play an important role , as expected .",
    "at slightly higher temperatures , the system `` bifurcates '' from the regime of quasi  harmonic motion to one where it executes quasiperiodic motion in the form of a collective soft - mode .",
    "we use the term `` soft - mode '' here since the dynamics is similar to what would be expected under a collective force on the particles , which diminishes as the energy increases .",
    "the frequencies of the normal vibrational modes become smaller and smaller and tend to zero at the transition .    as the energy continues to increase ,",
    "these soft modes overcome the energy barriers and set out to explore broader domains of phase space . at even higher temperatures ,",
    "their motion becomes erratic and the ion crystal `` melts '' , entering a regime of strongly chaotic motion in phase space .",
    "as the temperature increases further , the ions form a thermal cloud in which the mean coulomb potential energy starts to become negligible with respect to the mean kinetic energy and mean harmonic potential energy .",
    "it has been shown that the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath61 reaches its peak value at energies well above the `` melting phase '' , while this transition is not manifested in the behavior of the lyapunov exponents as a function of the number of particles @xmath10 or the energy @xmath41 .",
    "finally , for energies beyond the peak value of the maximum lyapunov exponent , the motion is dominated by the kinetic energy part and the system becomes amenable to a statistical mechanical treatment with considerable accuracy , in spite of the small number of particles present .",
    "indeed , at such high temperatures @xmath62 , the spatial disorder of the microplasma can be described in terms of its thermodynamic entropy and its maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath61 expressed by the theoretical estimate @xcite @xmath63 which may be used to characterize the crossover to the regime of thermal cloud motion , albeit at a high computational cost for the determination of @xmath61 .     and @xmath64 ( prolate quasi 1dimensional geometry ) : ( a ) at @xmath65 the motion is dominated by its stable normal modes and `` crystalline '' behavior is observed .",
    "( b ) at @xmath66 a transition to chaotic motion occurs , where `` melting '' is expected to take place .",
    "( c ) at @xmath67 the onset of `` thermal cloud '' behavior is evident.[fig:4 ] , scaledwidth=100.0%,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    furthermore , in @xcite , the maximum value of @xmath61 is numerically observed to obey a power law with respect to the energy as well as the number of ions .",
    "thus , one reaches the conclusion that , for a prolate trap geometry ( quasi 1dimensional ) , the `` melting transition '' and its associated microscopic dynamical behavior should be detectable at low energies and few number of ions ( e.g. for @xmath68 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "the different characteristic kinds of motion in such a setting are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "panel ( a ) presents a typical behavior of the ions at energy @xmath65 , where the dynamics is dominated by stable normal modes that correspond to `` crystalline '' behavior . at the slightly increased energy @xmath66 of panel ( b ) we observe the occurrence of a transition from stable collective ( quasi  periodic ) motion to chaotic behavior .",
    "finally , in panel ( c ) , the onset of a fully `` thermal '' cloud behavior is apparent at the energy @xmath67 .",

    "clearly , the crossover from ordered to weakly chaotic motion around @xmath70 does not occur in a manner justifying the use of statistical mechanics considerations .",
    "in the inset , the ratio of the standard deviation of the time averaged @xmath62 to the time averaged temperature @xmath62 shows that they are comparable.[temper],scaledwidth=100.0%,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the temperature , in dimensionless units , @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 denotes the euclidean norm of the @xmath28th ions velocity @xmath73 ) averaged over the time @xmath74 which is a proportional quantity of the mean kinetic energy of the ions is plotted in fig .",
    "[ temper ] , as a function of the energy @xmath41 for the microplasma with @xmath68 ions in the prolate penning trap with @xmath64 .",
    "evidently , the melting of the crystal here is not associated with a sharp increase of @xmath62 at some critical energy , as would be expected from a first order phase transition .",
    "note also in fig .",
    "[ temper ] that the fluctuations of @xmath62 ( measured by its standard deviation ) can not provide a clear indication of the crossover from a regime of stable oscillations , through `` melting '' , to strongly developed chaotic motion .",
    "so , the use of statistical mechanics considerations must focus on the importance of large fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the inset of fig .",
    "[ temper ] shows that the fluctuations of the time averaged temperature @xmath62 , in the crossover regime , are comparable with the values of the time averaged temperature itself .",
    "one can , therefore , say that there is no `` macroscopic '' methodology for detecting dynamical regime changes in system that might be useful to theorists or experimentalists .",
    "it , therefore , becomes especially important to adopt a different approach and attempt to study dynamical regime changes in our microplasma system , by performing a detailed study of its _ microscopic _ dynamics .    to this end",
    ", we shall focus hereafter on the lower energy range of hamiltonian , where the transition from `` crystalline  like '' to `` liquid  like '' collective behavior takes place . in the next section , we review the methods used for the detection of these dynamical regimes , i.e. the smaller alignment index ( sali ) @xcite and the spectrum of lyapunov exponents @xcite and compare the information provided by these approaches .",
    "as we shall see , in the crossover regime , the sali exhibits a rather intricate `` stair  like '' power law decay to zero , with different lyapunov exponents , reminiscent of the `` stickiness '' behavior typically observed in the neighborhood of resonance islands of hamiltonian systems @xcite . in our case",
    ", this type of weakly chaotic dynamics will turn out to characterize the energy range over which the passage from ordered to irregular dynamics occurs , through what we call the `` melting transition '' .",

    "@xmath92 since both deviation vectors tend to align with the direction of the maximum lyapunov exponent as @xmath74 increases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the time evolution of the sali for chaotic orbits tends to zero exponentially at a rate related to the difference of the two largest lyapunov exponents @xmath61 and @xmath93 as @xcite @xmath94 on the other hand , if the orbit is ordered , sali exhibits small oscillations about a constant @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "this is so , because both deviation vectors tend to become tangential to the torus on which the orbit is evolving while remaining mutually linearly independent in time due the existence of local or global integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "it follows that this sharply different behavior of the sali for ordered and chaotic orbits makes it a reliable and computationally fast tool for distinguishing between order and chaos in hamiltonian systems of any number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the choice of the initial deviation vectors is arbitrary and in general does not affect the method apart from some very special cases demonstrated theoretically and verified numerically in a number of previous works @xcite .",
    "one of the most standard and well  established means for extracting information about the nature of a given orbit of a dynamical system is to calculate its maximum _ lyapunov characteristic exponent _ ( lce ) @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath96 the orbit is characterized as chaotic .",
    "the theory of lyapunov exponents was first applied to characterize chaotic orbits by oseledec @xcite , while the connection between lyapunov exponents and exponential divergence of nearby orbits was given in @xcite .",
    "benettin et al .",
    "@xcite studied the problem of the computation of all lces theoretically and proposed in @xcite an algorithm for their efficient numerical evaluation .",
    "in particular , @xmath61 is computed as the limit for @xmath97 of the quantity @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 are deviation vectors from the orbit we want to characterize , at times @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",

    ", we shall compute the values of all lyapunov exponents ( called the lyapunov spectrum ) using the algorithm proposed by benettin et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us also recall that the lyapunov spectrum of an @xmath10 degree of freedom hamiltonian system , i.e. @xmath106 , exhibits a basic symmetry with @xmath107 of its members having the opposite sign of the other @xmath107 and two exponents , i.e. @xmath108 , @xmath109 , being equal to 0 .",
    "so , the discussion from here on concerns only the positive half of the lyapunov spectrum , @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "the calculation of the lyapunov spectrum is computationally demanding , as its convergence often requires the integration of trajectories over very long time intervals .",
    "this convergence depends on the inverse of the largest lyapunov exponent or _",

    "such quantities indeed furnish important information , not readily available by other more standard microscopic chaotic indicators or by related macroscopic entropic quantities .",
    "in this paper , we have reported results demonstrating the occurrence of dynamical regime changes in a hamiltonian system describing a microplasma confined in a prolate quasi 1dimensional configuration and characterized by long  range coulomb interactions .",
    "more specifically , in the lower energy regime , we macroscopically detected the transition from `` crystalline  like '' to `` liquid  like '' behavior , through what we call the `` melting phase '' .",
    "as expected , well beyond this phase , the microplasma exhibits strong chaotic behavior that may be described by the macroscopic variables of statistical mechanics .",
    "the question , therefore , is how can one determine the dynamical nature and identify the energy range of this `` melting transition '' from ordered to strongly chaotic behavior .    to this end",
    ", we first showed that the `` melting '' of our quasi 1dimensional crystal ( composed of few ions confined in a prolate trap ) is not associated with a sharp increase of the temperature at some critical energy , as might have been expected .",
    "furthermore , the positive lyapunov exponents ( and the kolmogorov ",
    "sinai entropy expressed by their sum ) attain their highest values at energies much higher than the regime where the microplasma `` melts '' .",
    "thus , it appears that there is no clear `` macroscopic '' methodology for identifying and studying this `` melting '' process in detail .",
    "next , we argued that even though information about dynamical regime changes must be contained in the lyapunov exponents , lyapunov spectra by themselves still fail to provide , a more precise picture of this change . indeed , while the ratios of the larger of them show strong fluctuations at low energies , these require further analysis before they can reveal , with any precision , the energies over which the `` melting transition '' occurs .    for these reasons , we found it useful to employ a more accurate tool , called the sali method , to study in more detail the local microscopic dynamics of the microplasma system . in this way",
    ", we discovered an energy range of _ weak chaos _",
    ", where the positive lyapunov exponents are very small and sali exhibits a stair  like decay to zero with varying decay rates . as @xmath168 in chaotic domains ,",
    "this inspired us to look more closely at the statistical fluctuations of the differences of the two largest lyapunov exponents @xmath2 in that regime .",
    "we , thus , observed that these differences exhibit their largest fluctuations over a definite energy interval , where `` melting '' occurs in a way reminiscent of `` sticky '' orbits , executing a multi  stage diffusion process near the boundaries of resonance islands in the phase space of hamiltonian systems .",
    "the above results were also supported by the use of an extended set of indices which generalize sali to the case of more than 2 deviation vectors .",
    "finally , we remark that it is also the rapid convergence of these indices , which turns them into efficient diagnostic tools that may be used to replace demanding molecular simulations in identifying weakly chaotic regimes in multi  particle systems .",
    "as we intend to show in a future publication , these indices can provide a viable alternative to the notoriously time consuming simulations required to study the presence of weak chaos and slow diffusive effects in the dynamics of metastable states .",
