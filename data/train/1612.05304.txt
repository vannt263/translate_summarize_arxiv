    "spectral properties of non - selfadjoint operators have been recently a subject of interest of many papers .",
    "a particular interest was related to the location of eigenvalues of differential operators in the complex plane @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding results for schrdinger operators can be found in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite and in @xcite .",
    "some other problems were studied in the papers @xcite-@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the operator we study is related to the quantum theory of a material consisting of two layers of graphene .",
    "namely , we consider the operator @xmath4 , where @xmath5 this operator acts in the hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "the domain of @xmath7 is the sobolev space @xmath8 .",
    "the potential @xmath1 is a not necessary self - adjoint matrix - valued function @xmath9 where the matrix elements are allowed to take complex values . for the matrix @xmath1",
    "we denote @xmath10 assuming that @xmath1 decays at the infinity in some integral sense we would like to answer the question : `` where are the eigenvalues of @xmath7 located ? ''    note that since @xmath11 , the spectrum @xmath12 of @xmath0 is the set @xmath13\\cup [ m,\\infty)$ ] .",
    "our results show that the eigenvalues of @xmath7 are located near the edges of the absolutely continuous spectrum , i.e. near the points @xmath14 .",
    "since the spectrum of the unperturbed operator has two edges , our results resemble some of the theorems of the paper @xcite related to the dirac operator . however , the main difference between the two papers is that we study a differential operator on a plane , while the article @xcite deals with operators on a line .",

    "let @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath17 with @xmath18 independent of @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath21 , then @xmath22    the next statement tells us about what happens when @xmath23 .",
    "[ t1.2 ] let @xmath15 be an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath24 then @xmath25 @xmath26 where the constant @xmath27 is independent of @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    note that this statement also holds true for @xmath28    let @xmath21 and let @xmath29 be an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath7 .",

    "we consider a special case where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , in this case we can get a more precise information about location of the complex eigenvalues , see theorem 3.1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if @xmath21 ( no gap in the continuous spectrum ) , then perturbations by such matrix - functions do not create any complex eigenvalues .",
    "here we have similarities with the result obtained for the one dimensional dirac operators in @xcite .",
    "in order to prove our main results we need the birman - schwinger principle formulated below .",

    "a point @xmath40 is an eigenvalue of @xmath7 if and only if @xmath41 is an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath42 in particular , if @xmath43 is an eigenvalue of @xmath7 then @xmath44 .",
    "the proof of this statement is standard and it is left to the reader as an exercise .",

    "_ proof of theorem  [ t1.1]_. since @xmath48 it is easy to see that @xmath49 where @xmath50 one can also note that the last term in the right hand side of can be rewritten in the form @xmath51 the operator @xmath52 is an integral operator with the kernel @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the hankel function of first kind and @xmath55 .",
    "it is a simple consequence of the fact that @xmath56 the kernel of @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "another useful representation of @xmath59 follows from the fact that the kernel of @xmath57 equals ( see @xcite ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 let us define @xmath62 we need to know the behaviour of the function @xmath63 only in the region @xmath64 , where we have @xmath65 the behaviour of the function @xmath63 near zero is determined by the expansion of the hankel function in the neighbourhood of @xmath66 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath67 let @xmath68 be the kernel of the integral operator @xmath69 @xmath70 therefore @xmath71 as a consequence , if we denote by @xmath72 the kernel of the operator @xmath73 then latexmath:[\\[\\label{rho1 }    latexmath:[\\[\\label{rho2 }    to prove the latter relations , one has to differentiate the integral kernel of @xmath52 , using the formulas @xmath75 and @xmath76 since the integral kernel of @xmath52 is @xmath77 , we obtain from that @xmath78 the positive constants in the inequalities and do not depend on @xmath79 $ ] . in particular , @xmath80 let us estimate now the norm of the operator @xmath81 with the kernel @xmath82 for that purpose , we estimate the sesquie - linear form of this operator : @xmath83 obviously , @xmath84",

    "moreover it is bounded .",
    "therefore , by mimicking the above arguments , one proves that @xmath98 this leads to the estimate @xmath99 now the statement of our theorem follows from the fact that if @xmath19 is an eigenvalue of @xmath4 , then @xmath100 .",
    "the proof is complete .    in the picture below we describe the areas of possible location of complex eigenvalues depending on the value of @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
