    "positrons are a useful tool in many areas of science , such as condensed matter physics , surface science and medicine ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . despite this",
    ", there is still much about their interactions with ordinary matter that remains to be explored theoretically . in particular , the binding of positrons to matter has been a difficult subject to research @xcite . on the part of theory , this is due to the strong electron - positron correlations which determine the binding energy and , in many cases , ensure the very existence of bound states . on the experimental side ,",
    "positron binding to atoms has not been verified experimentally , largely due the difficulty in obtaining the relevant species in the gas phase . on the other hand , for polyatomic molecules",
    "a wealth of information is now available thanks to the special role that vibrational feshbach resonances play in positron - molecule annihilation @xcite .",
    "before a positron annihilates with an electron in a molecule , it usually forms a quasibound state with the molecule by transferring its excess energy into vibrations of a single mode with near - resonant energy .",
    "this leads to pronounced resonances observed in the positron - energy dependence of the annihilation rate @xcite . using the relation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy of the resonance due to vibrational mode @xmath2 with energy @xmath3 ,",
    "experimentalists have now been able to measure values of the positron binding energy @xmath4 for over sixty molecules @xcite .",
    "these measurements led to the construction of a phenomenological parametric fit of @xmath4 in terms of the the dipole polarizability @xmath5 and permanent dipole moment @xmath6 of the molecule : @xmath7 where @xmath4 is in milli - electron volts , @xmath5 is in cubic angstroms and @xmath6 is in debyes ( d ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of is that the dependences of @xmath4 on @xmath6 and @xmath5 are both linear .",
    "although a general increase of @xmath4 with @xmath6 and @xmath5 is to be expected ( since both contribute to the positron - molecule attraction ) , there is no obvious reason why the dependences should be linear .",
    "in fact , measurements for some molecules with large dipole moments , such as acetone and acetonitrile , yielded binding energies more than double the values predicted by equation @xcite .    despite the wealth of experimental data on positron - molecule binding energies ,",
    "theoretical developments are somewhat behind .",
    "there are few calculations of positron binding to nonpolar or weakly polar molecules .",
    "the zero - range potential model @xcite captured the qualitative features of the binding for alkanes and correctly predicted the emergence of the second bound state @xcite .",
    "there were also predictions of positron binding to the hydrogen molecule in the excited @xmath8  @xmath9 state @xcite , and configuration interaction calculations for carbon - containing triatomics ( co@xmath10 , cs@xmath10 , cse@xmath10 and weakly polar cos , cose and csse ) @xcite .",
    "the latter papers reported binding by the two heaviest species in the vibrational ground state , by cs@xmath10 in the lowest vibrationally excited states , and by other molecules at higher vibrational excitations or upon bond deformations . in contrast , there is a large number of quantum chemistry calculations of positron binding with strongly polar polyatomic molecules with dipole moments @xmath11 . for such molecules binding",
    "is achieved even at the lowest , static - field ( e.g. , hartree - fock ) level of theory .",
    "the static - field binding energies , however , are usually quite small , and the effect of correlations ( e.g. , polarization of the molecule by the positron ) increases the binding energy dramatically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent configuration interaction calculations for nitriles , acetaldehyde , and acetone @xcite in fact give binding energies within 2550% of the experiment , which is quite good , given the complexity of the system .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present a simple model for positron binding to polar molecules . for many molecules of interest the dipole moment",
    "is dominated by a single bond ( e.g. , cn or co ) , located at one end of the molecule , with the negative charge on the terminal atom . given the positron repulsion from the atomic nuclei , we model the molecular potential as a point dipole surrounded by an impenetrable sphere .",
    "of course , the true size of the molecular dipole is finite , of the order of interatomic distances . however , for weakly bound positron states , the wave function of the positron is very diffuse .",
    "its spatial extent is much greater than the physical size of the dipole , which justifies the applicability of the point - dipole model to weakly bound positron states .",
    "this is illustrated by figure [ fig : ch3cn ] , which shows the density for the positron bound in the dipole field of the acetonitrile molecule ( ch@xmath12cn ) .",
    "the figure also shows that the positron is localized in the negative - energy well of the dipole potential and is largely `` unaware '' of the true geometry of the molecule .",
    "this justifies the hard - sphere model for the short - range positron repulsion .",
    "quantum chemistry calculations of the positron density in polar molecules support the picture of a diffuse positronic cloud localized off the negatively charged end of the molecular dipole @xcite .     of the acetonitrile molecule and repulsive core of the radius @xmath13 , with the binding energy of @xmath14 . ]",
    "note that a recent paper @xcite combined a hard - sphere repulsive core with the polarization potential to model positron binding to atoms and nonpolar molecules .",
    "while the two models bear some similarity , the physics of positron binding to neutral atoms and nonpolar species is very different from that of binding to strongly polar molecules explored in this work . in the former case , for atoms",
    "the positron does form a spherical cloud , but for molecules the shape of the positron wave function largely repeats that of the molecule @xcite , and the spherical repulsive core approximation is hard to justify .",
    "in contrast , for bound states with polar species , the positron resides in the dipole - generated well to one side of the molecule ( see figure [ fig : ch3cn ] ) , and the repulsive core model looks more appropriate .",
    "the main features of binding by the dipole potential are outlined in section [ sec : theory ] . applying the model to polar molecules for which the positron binding energies are known from experiment ( section [ sec : dipole ] )",
    "shows that electron - positron correlations have a large effect on binding .",
    "we include these in the form of the polarization potential , first via perturbation theory ( section [ sec : perturb ] ) and then non - perturbatively ( section [ sec : nonpert ] ) .",
    "while this model may appear to be rather crude , it captures the main physical aspects of the problem . owing to its simplicity",
    ", it provides a deeper understanding of some of the key features that have been observed in experiment , including the empirical scaling ( [ eqn : regression ] ) .",
    "the usefulness of such models as a means of obtaining an _ explanation _ , and complementary to heavy numerical computations , was argued well by ostrovsky , who introduced the notion of complementarity between calculation and explanation @xcite .",
    "we model the molecule as an impenetrable sphere of radius @xmath15 , with a point dipole of dipole moment @xmath16 fixed at its centre ( the origin ) .",
    "the positron experiences point - dipole potential in the region outside the sphere . using spherical polar coordinates @xmath17 and choosing the polar ( @xmath18- ) axis along @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the polar angle , and we work in atomic units ( au ) .    although is a non - central potential , the schrdinger equation , @xmath22 \\psi(\\mathbf{r } ) = e \\psi({\\bf r}),\\ ] ] for the positron wave function @xmath23 and energy @xmath24 can be solved in the region @xmath25 using separation of variables . inserting the ansatz @xmath26 into yields separate radial and angular equations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a separation constant . if @xmath29 then becomes @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the squared angular momentum operator .",
    "this is just the eigenvalue equation for the @xmath31 operator ; the possible values of @xmath28 are @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( the azimuthal quantum number ) is a non - negative integer , and the eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ( the magnetic quantum number ) is the eigenvalue of @xmath36 , and @xmath35 is an integer , @xmath37 .    for @xmath38 , @xmath33 is no longer a good quantum number since @xmath31 does not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "however , @xmath36 does commute with the hamiltonian , and thus @xmath35 is still a good quantum number .",
    "we must solve the angular equation to find the new values of @xmath28 . with this information",
    "we will be able to solve the radial equation and use it to investigate the dependence of the binding energy @xmath39 on @xmath6 and @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath35 is a good quantum number , there will be a distinct set of eigenfunctions @xmath40 of the angular equation for each value of @xmath35 .",
    "we expand the unknown functions in the basis of spherical harmonics , i.e. , @xmath41 where the @xmath42 are unknown numbers . substituting this expression into , multiplying across by @xmath43 , where @xmath33 is a non - negative integer such that @xmath44 , integrating over @xmath45 and @xmath46 and using properties of spherical harmonics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) yields @xmath47 where @xmath48 and the arrays in parentheses are @xmath49 symbols . the eigenvalue @xmath28 has been renamed @xmath50 since it will have different sets of values depending on @xmath35 .",
    "equations are a set of matrix eigenvalue equations for the semi - infinite , symmetric , tridiagonal matrix @xmath51 , whose rows and columns are enumerated by @xmath33 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "each of these matrices has a countably infinite set of eigenvalues , so we rename @xmath50 as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 enumerates the different eigenvalues for each @xmath35 , and the eigenvalues are arranged so that @xmath55 .",

    "it can be shown that for @xmath58 there will be an infinite number of bound states , while for @xmath59 there will be none @xcite ( see section [ subsec : radeq ] ) .",

    "this gap depends on the moment of inertia of the molecule and increases with the molecular angular momentum , being smallest for large , slowly rotating molecules .",
    "another consideration important for _ ab initio _ quantum - chemistry calculatons of binding is that for the values of @xmath6 only slightly exceeding @xmath72 , the binding energy is very sensitive to the actual value of the dipole moment ( see figure [ fig : energyvsd ] in section [ subsec : ber_0d ] ) .",
    "the actual value of the dipole moment depends on the approximation used ( e.g. , hartree - fock ) , and can be a significant source of error @xcite .",

    "the molecules lie in the convex region ( which spans a larger range of polarizabilities than for the other families ) , and the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath5 is markedly nonlinear .",

    "table [ tab : binden_nonperturb ] and figure [ fig : binden_nonperturb ] also show our estimate of the binding energy for hcn . as seen from the graph , the experimental value lies very close to the prediction curve for the aldehydes data , which provides support that the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath155 is not truly linear .",

    "interestingly , if we now place hcn in the ketones family , its estimated binding energy becomes , in very close accord with the dmc value .",
    "this is further evidence that a nonperturbative treatment of molecular polarization gives overall much more consistent results .",
    "here we provided a simple model for positron binding to polar molecules , which captures the essential physics of this system .    modelling the molecule as a sphere of radius @xmath15 with a static point dipole of dipole moment @xmath6 at the centre and using experimental data on binding energies required unphysically small values of @xmath15 , even for the most strongly polar molecules .",
    "this indicated that the binding energies are greatly enhanced by some factor other than the molecule s permanent dipole moment , i.e. , electron - positron correlations .    including the effect of correlations perturbatively through the polarization potential",
    "did confirm this expectation .",
    "it showed that even for the strongly polar molecules , the effect of correlations increased the binding energy by an order of magnitude compared to the static - dipole calculation .",
    "the observed increase matched the difference between the ci and hf binding energies obtained in state - of - the - art quantum chemistry calculations .    including the polarization potential as a perturbation of",
    "the original hamiltonian also yielded larger , more physical values of @xmath15 for all of the molecules studied , but for most molecules they were still too small to be interpreted directly .",
    "this was partly due to the fact that the true static potential for the positron near the molecule is less repulsive than the hard wall of our model . reduced values of @xmath15 may also account for some of the short - range correlation effects , such as virtual positronium formation .",
    "sensible values of @xmath15 were , however , obtained for the nitriles , the most strongly polar of all the molecules studied . in spite of the fact that most of the molecules had unphysical values of @xmath15 , it was found that taking the value of @xmath6 and @xmath15 for the molecule in each chemical family with the median dipole moment and varying the polarizability to match the other molecules in the family , gave reliable predictions of the binding energies for those molecules ( with the exception of the methyl halides ) .",
    "the perturbative treatment was also in line with the observation made by experimentalists , that the dependence of the binding energy on the polarizability of the molecule is apparently almost linear @xcite .",
    "of course , a general increase in the binding energy with the polarizability could be expected , but there was no explanation for the linear dependence . according to our model , this feature indicates that the perturbation theory is at least qualitatively correct , even though the first - order energy corrections are generally greater than the original ( dipole ) eigenenergies .",
    "the results of this treatment for the methyl halides , however , were very poor in comparison with the other families , and we attributed this to the fact that the binding by the base molecule ( @xmath148 ) is likely affected by rotations , and that the three methyl halide molecules had a significantly larger range of ionization potentials that the other families . the latter could indicate a significant change in the contribution of virtual positronium formation across the members of this family , which is not accounted for in our model .",
    "a test of the model was to use it to predict the binding energy for hydrogen cyanide , which has not been measured experimentally .",
    "our estimate agreed with a previous calculation using the diffusion monte carlo method to within 20% , which provides evidence that our model has good predictive power and could be useful for estimating the binding energies that have never been measured in experiment , provided that the binding energy for a molecule with a similar value of @xmath6 is known .",
    "the most glaring limitation of the model as it stood was that it could not predict binding energies using only the dipole moment and polarizability of a molecule . to perform a calculation one needed a value of @xmath15 , and unless binding energies for molecules with similar values of @xmath6 were known",
    ", one could not easily choose a suitable value for @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , we found that for most of the chemical families we considered the values of @xmath15 had no immediate physical relevance , and for the most weakly polar families ( i.e. , formates and acetates ) there were significant variations in the values of @xmath15 despite the similar values of @xmath6 .    in a bid to attain physically meaningful values of @xmath15 for all of the molecules",
    ", we proceeded to include the effects of polarization in a non - perturbative way .",
    "we experimented by solving the radial schrdinger equation numerically using several model polarization potentials , and found that the best results were obtained using a polarization potential of the form @xmath156 , with the cut - off radius @xmath157 ( @xmath145 being a constant ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath145 was chosen separately for each chemical family so as to minimize the spread of @xmath15 within each family .",
    "physically meaningful values of @xmath15 ( in the range 0.941.43au ) were then obtained for all molecules . by choosing the values of @xmath145 carefully",
    ", the spread of values of @xmath15 within in each family was made relatively small , though there was inevitably still a larger range of across the entire set of molecules .",
    "the most strongly ( weakly ) polar molecules still possessed the largest ( smallest ) values of @xmath15 .",
    "again fixing @xmath6 and @xmath15 for each family and varying only the polarizability led to excellent predictions of @xmath4 ; the predictions were generally more accurate than their perturbative counterparts , with particularly large improvement for the methyl halides .",
    "we observed that the true dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath5 is actually nonlinear .",
    "the prediction for hcn was also slightly better than its perturbative counterpart , and supported our observation of nonlinear growth of @xmath4 with @xmath5 .    in summary , our model can be used effectively to predict positron - molecule binding energies based on the molecular dipole moment and dipole polarizability , particularly when polarization is included in a non - perturbative way .",
    "it provides a clear picture of the system , thereby complementing the current computational effort towards rigorous theory of positron - molecule binding .",
