    "due to the largest cross section of all processes at the hadron colliders dijet production opens a possibility to search for a signal of new physics in the very early data .",
    "in particular , a bump in the dijet invariant mass spectrum would indicate the presence of a resonance decaying into two energetic partons .",
    "however , due to the huge qcd background the bump could be just a statistical fluctuation of the limited integrated luminosity of the fist data .",
    "besides this , the bump in the invariant mass distribution stems from the breit  wigner propagator form , which is characteristic for any type of the resonance regardless of its other properties , like spin , internal quantum number , etc .",
    "therefore , other observables are necessary in order to confirm the bump and to reveal the resonance properties .",
    "the distribution of dijets over the polar angle @xmath2 is angle between the axis of the jet pair and the beam direction in the dijet rest frame  @xcite . ]",
    "is directly sensitive to the resonance spin and the dynamics of the underlying process .",
    "while the qcd processes are dominated by @xmath3-channel gluon exchanges , which lead to a rutherford - like distribution @xmath4 , exotic physics processes proceed mainly through the @xmath5-channel , where the spin of the resonance uniquely defines the angular distribution . for high - mass resonances and practically massless partons",
    "it is convenient to use the helicity formalism , since the helicity is a good quantum number for massless particles .",
    "for example , the decay angular distribution in the centre - of - momentum frame of a particle with spin-@xmath5 and helicity @xmath6 with @xmath7 decaying into two massless particles with helicities @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be written as  @xcite @xmath10 where the helicity amplitude @xmath11 is expressed through the difference @xmath12 with @xmath13 and the reduced decay amplitude @xmath14 , which is a function of @xmath5 and the helicities of the outgoing particles , but is independent on the azimuthal ( @xmath15 ) and the polar ( @xmath2 ) angles .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence is concentrated only in the well - known @xmath16-functions @xmath17 .",
    "the absolute value of the dijet rapidity difference is related to the polar scattering angle @xmath2 with respect to the beam axis by @xmath18\\ge 0 $ ] and is invariant under boosts along the beam direction .",
    "the choice of the other variable @xmath19 is motivated by the fact that rutherford scattering does not depend on it .    in the next section",
    "we will analyse a model independent signal of new physics using distributions on these variables and their combinations .",
    "let us consider different possibilities for the spin of a resonance and its possible interactions with partons .",
    "the simplest case of the resonance production of a ( pseudo)scalar particle @xmath20 with spin 0 in @xmath5-channel leads to a uniform decay distribution on the scattering angle @xmath21    the spin-1/2 fermion resonance , like an excited quark @xmath22 , leads to asymmetric decay distributions for the given spin parton configurations @xmath23 and @xmath24 however , the choice of the variables , which depend on the absolute value of @xmath25 , cancels out the apparent dependence on @xmath25 . in other words , the distributions",
    "( [ g12 ] ) and ( [ g-12 ] ) for dijet events look like uniform distributions on @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    according to the simple formula @xmath28 the uniform distribution leads to kinematical peaks at small values of @xmath29 ( the dotted curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( the dotted curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath32    a novel situation can occur for the spin-1 resonances , which appear as new gauge bosons in the extended gauge symmetry groups .",
    "we will consider all possible interactions of such bosons with the ordinary fermions .",
    "there are two different possibilities .",
    "the gauge bosons , which are associated with additional @xmath33 gauge symmetry ( or transform under the adjoint representation of the extra gauge group ) , are generally called @xmath34 particles .",
    "they have minimal gauge interactions with the known light fermions @xmath35 which preserve the fermion chiralities and possess maximal helicities @xmath36 . at a symmetric @xmath37 collider , like the lhc",
    ", such interactions lead to the specific symmetric angular distribution of the resonance decay products over the polar angle @xmath2 , @xmath38 similar to the uniform distribution , eq .",
    "( [ gll ] ) leads to kinematical peaks also at small values of @xmath29 ( the dash - dotted curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath39 and @xmath31 ( the dash - dotted curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath40    another possibility is the resonance production and decay of new longitudinal spin-1 bosons with helicity @xmath41 .",
    "the new gauge bosons with such properties arise in many extensions  @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) , which solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "they transform as doublets @xmath42 under the fundamental representation of the sm @xmath43 group like the sm higgs boson .",
    "while the @xmath44 bosons with helicities @xmath36 are produced in left(right)-handed quark and right(left)-handed antiquark fusion , the longitudinal @xmath45 bosons can be produced through the anomalous chiral couplings with the ordinary light fermions @xmath46 }      + \\frac{g^f_{rl}}{m}\\,\\overline{\\psi^f_r}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu }      \\psi^f_l\\;\\partial_{[\\mu } z^*_{\\nu]}\\right)\\ ] ] in left - handed or right - handed quark - antiquark fusion  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous interactions ( [ lr ] ) are generated on the level of the quantum loop corrections and can be considered as effective interactions .",
    "the gauge doublets , coupled to the tensor quark currents , are some types of `` excited '' states as far as the only orbital angular momentum with @xmath47 contributes to the total angular moment , while the total spin of the system is zero .",
    "this property manifests itself in their derivative couplings to fermions and a different chiral structure of the interactions in contrast to the minimal gauge interactions ( [ ll ] ) .",
    "the anomalous couplings lead to a different angular distribution of the resonance decay @xmath48 than the previously considered ones . at first sight",
    ", the small difference between the distributions ( [ gll ] ) and ( [ glr ] ) seems unimportant .",
    "however , the absence of the constant term in the latter case results in novel experimental signatures .",
    "first of all , the uniform distribution ( [ g0 ] ) for scalar and spin-1/2 particles and the distribution ( [ gll ] ) for gauge vector bosons with minimal coupling include a nonzero constant term , which leads , to a kinematic singularity in the transverse momentum distribution of the final parton @xmath49 in the narrow width approximation @xmath50 @xmath51 after smearing from the resonance finite width the singularity is transformed into the well - known jacobian peak ( the dash - dotted curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) .",
    "the analytic expression of the @xmath52 distribution can be found in @xcite .    using the same method one can derive the analogous distribution for the excited bosons ( the solid curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) .",
    "@xmath53 in contrast to the previous case , the pole in the decay distribution of the excited bosons is canceled out and the final parton @xmath54 distribution has a broad smooth hump  @xcite with a maximum at @xmath55 below the kinematical endpoint @xmath56 , instead of a sharp jacobian peak , that obscures their experimental identification as resonances .",
    "therefore , the transverse jet momentum is not the appropriate variable for the excited boson search .",
    "another striking feature of the distribution ( [ glr ] ) is the forbidden decay direction perpendicular to the boost of the excited boson in the rest frame of the latter ( the collins  soper frame  @xcite ) .",
    "it leads to a profound dip at @xmath57 in the collins  soper frame  @xcite in comparison with the gauge boson distribution ( the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) . the same dips present also at small values of @xmath58  @xcite ( the solid curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath59 and @xmath31 ( the solid curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath60    it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] that the excited bosons have unique signature in the angular distributions .",
    "they manifest themselves through the absolute minima at small values of @xmath58 and @xmath31 and absolute maxima right away from the origin .",
    "so , the rapidity difference distribution reaches the absolute maximum at @xmath61 and at @xmath62 for the angular distribution on the dijet variable @xmath27 .",
    "in order to satisfy to bin purity and stability for physics studies it is convenient to use equidistant binning in @xmath63  @xcite , which corresponds to periodic cell granularity of calorimeter in @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the smooth @xmath27-spectra ( see eqs .",
    "( [ chi1prime ] ) and ( [ chi1star ] ) ) transform into histograms with maximum in the lowest bin for the gauge bosons with the minimal coupling and with maximum in the bin containing value of @xmath65 for the excited bosons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that a shape similar to the excited - boson one ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) can be observed in the preliminary atlas data  @xcite in @xmath27-distribution for the highest dijet mass region @xmath66  gev .    using distributions in ( pseudo)rapidity and @xmath27",
    "we can construct two useful ratios : the wide - angle to small - angle ratio @xmath67 and the centrality or @xmath64-ratio of both jets @xmath68 which are less affected by the systematic errors and , therefore , used for search of new physics in dijet data .    let us suppose that we have found some bump in the dijet invariant mass distribution .",
    "for example , an excess at 550  gev can be seen in the preliminary atlas data  @xcite for dijet processes at 0.315 nb@xmath69 of integrated luminosity .",
    ", do not confirm this excess . ]",
    "then we can compare the angular distributions for `` on peak '' and `` off peak '' events , using , for example , the aforementioned ratios .",
    "since the qcd backgrounds is dominated by the rutherford - like distribution , we can consider , as an approximation , a simple case when the qcd dijet @xmath27-distribution is flat .",
    "it means that for the selected equal regions @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , the @xmath72 ratio for the `` off peak '' events should be approximately one and does not depend on the dijet mass .    in the case ,",
    "when the `` on peak '' events have originated from the new physics and have angular distribution different from the qcd one , this @xmath72 ratio should deviate from one .",
    "all known exotic models , besides the excited bosons , predict @xmath73 due to an excess at low @xmath27 values independent on @xmath74 . in order to emphasize the effect of new physics in the case of the specific signature of the excited bosons , when @xmath75 , we need to choose @xmath74 value , which minimizes the ratio @xmath76 since @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , it is possible for the choice of the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 due to the monotonic increase of the distribution for the excited bosons until the maximum at @xmath62 .",
    "the larger value of @xmath82{2}-1)\\approx 3.85 $ ] will lead to a compensation of the contributions from low and high @xmath27-parts and @xmath83 .    for the fixed parameters @xmath74 and @xmath84 the centrality ratio @xmath85 for the qcd processes",
    "is also almost constant and should not depend on the dijet invariant mass . in the case of a presence of new physics signal",
    "this ratio could deviate from its constant value . for almost all exotic models",
    "the signal events are concentrated in the central region and usually this lead to a bump in @xmath85 distribution versus the dijet masses .",
    "by contrast to this , the signal from the excited bosons can lead to a novel signature : a dip in the distribution at the resonance mass .",
    "we have used the comphep package  @xcite and the extended model with the excited bosons  @xcite to generate two dimensional pseudorapidity distributions for `` @xmath86 '' processes proceeding through the gauge @xmath87 and excited @xmath88 boson resonances with the same mass 550 gev at @xmath89  tev @xmath37 collider ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eta2dim ] ) .",
    "the cteq6l parton distribution functions were used . for both final jets we impose cuts on the pseudorapidity @xmath90 and the transverse momentum @xmath91  gev .    to minimize the potential differences in jet response between the _ inner _ and _ outer _ dijet events one can choose the central region of the calorimeter @xmath92 . using the scatter plots in fig .  [ fig : eta2dim ] one can estimate the centrality ratios ( [ centrality ] ) for the gauge @xmath93 and the excited @xmath94 bosons .",
    "there is dramatic difference between these two cases , which should lead to corresponding experimental signature .",
    "since the qcd ratio @xmath95 is between the numbers in ( [ etarprime ] ) and ( [ etarstar ] ) the gauge bosons with the minimal coupling will lead to increasing the qcd ratio at the resonance mass , while the excited bosons should decrease the ratio .",
    "just the second type of the novel signature can be observed in the distribution of the @xmath64-ratio versus the dijet invariant mass in the atlas data  @xcite in approximately the same mass range , @xmath96  gev , as for the resonance bump in the dijet events  @xcite .",
    "let us stress here that the extensions of the signal region up to @xmath97 and the central region up to @xmath98 do not change drastically the qcd ratio @xmath99 , but dilute the signal from the excited bosons , since @xmath100 .",
    "in order to increase the sensitivity to new physics one can consider the centrality ratio only for the dijet events with opposite pseudorapidities @xmath101 ( the hatched regions in fig .  [",
    "fig : eta2dim ] ) . in this case",
    "we get a bit larger deviation form one : @xmath102 for the gauge and @xmath103 for the excited bosons .",
    "but in this case we lose half of the statistics . therefore , it is convenient to consider the distribution on @xmath104 for the events in the rectangle region @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "is necessarily to reduce an effect of the parton distribution functions on different @xmath107 bins . ]",
    "the corresponding centrality ratio @xmath108 is defined as @xmath109    the normalized histograms of @xmath107-spectra and the theoretical curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] for the following parameters values : @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure , that the theoretical distributions describe very well the above - mentioned simulation data . in the same way as it was done for",
    "the @xmath27-distribution of the excited bosons one can maximize the deviation from the qcd ratio @xmath112 @xmath113 since @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 , for the central calorimeter @xmath118 the minimum appears at @xmath119 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the novel experimental signatures of the chiral excited bosons in the dijet data .",
    "they possess drastically different angular distributions from all previously discussed exotic models .",
    "for the special choice of parameters the wide - angle to small - angle ratio and the centrality ratio could be less than their qcd values , that will be definitely pointing out to the presence of excited bosons .",
