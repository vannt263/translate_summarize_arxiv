    "in the last few years progress has been achieved in understanding the production of electromagnetic probes in a quark - gluon plasma in equilibrium . in the case of a hard photon ( which is defined as having an energy larger than the temperature t of the plasma ) the usual compton and annihilation processes discussed long ago @xcite are not the only leading - order mechanisms .",
    "it turns out that bremsstrahlung of a quark in a plasma gives a leading contribution @xcite and , more importantly , a crossed process from bremsstrahlung actually dominates at a large enough energy @xcite .",
    "this process , sometimes referred to as off - shell annihilation or annihilation with scattering , is of type 3-@xmath2 2-@xmath3 : the photon is produced via quark - antiquark annihilation where one of the incoming quarks is put off - shell by scattering in the plasma .",
    "however , the formation time of the photon is comparable to , or larger than , the average time between soft scatterings of a quark in the plasma ( inverse of the damping rate ) .",
    "this implies that multiple scattering plays an important role in these photon emission processes @xcite .    a correct treatment of multiple scattering , even after performing hard thermal loop ( htl )",
    "resummation @xcite , involves the resummation of ladder diagrams with effective propagators for both fermions and gluons .",
    "this resummation leads to an integral equation , which has been solved to give the photon emission rate to leading order in the strong coupling @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the resummation of higher loop diagrams implements the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal @xcite effect which has been much discussed recently in the context of jet energy loss in a hot medium @xcite .",
    "however , there are differences between the approach followed here for photon production and that used for jet quenching : we work consistently in the htl approach , using the actual distribution of moving charges in the plasma and dynamical screening of interactions , rather than a model of static , debye screened charges .",
    "note that no magnetic mass needs to be introduced in order to screen transverse gluons , since ultrasoft divergences have been shown to cancel thanks to cancellations between diagrams of different topologies @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary hydrodynamical studies @xcite , which take into account the above mechanisms of photon production , show that the thermal rate ( including the contribution from the hot hadronic phase ) should clearly emerge above prompt photon sources ( produced in the early stages of the collisions ) in a range from 1 gev @xmath5 3 gev to 5 gev at rhic and lhc .",
    "the above developments are quite timely in view of the recent wa98 measurements at sps @xcite and of the upcoming results at rhic where the photon spectrum in gold - gold collisions is being measured @xcite .",
    "there is however an uncertainty concerning the possibility of separating the spectrum of direct photons from that of photons which are decay products of resonances , in particular @xmath6 s . in the energy range of interest",
    "the @xmath6 signal may be almost two orders of magnitude above the direct photon rate and the subtraction of the @xmath7 background from the data is a formidable experimental challenge .    in the mean time it is interesting to consider an alternative channel which carries the same dynamical information as the real photon production rate , but which suffers a different , less important , background .",
    "this is the case of the production of low mass lepton pairs at large momentum .",
    "the invariant mass of the pair should be high enough to be above the background of dalitz pairs from the pions , but small enough that the rate remains appreciable .",
    "typically one expects the range 150 mev @xmath8 500 mev to be realistic for our purposes ( @xmath9 is the invariant mass of the lepton pair ) .",
    "higher mass ranges ( above the vector meson masses ) should also be explored .",
    "this rate has already been calculated for the drell - yan process @xcite , for the @xmath10 processes @xcite , and for bremsstrahlung and off - shell annihilation in the approximation where the quark undergoes a single scattering in the medium @xcite .",
    "the analysis of multiple scattering is clearly called for .",
    "compared to the real photon case , the results of @xcite show increased technical difficulties associated with the much more complicated analytic structure of the diagrams : more unitarity cuts contribute and the cancellation of divergences between the various cuts is a subtle affair . in accordance with general theorems of perturbation",
    "theory @xcite , the calculated rate turns out to be finite everywhere except at the @xmath11 threshold ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 the quark thermal mass ) where there remain integrable ( square root and logarithm ) singularities .",
    "however , this threshold is right where the formation time is the longest , and rescattering effects are expected to be largest . therefore the two loop analysis @xcite is not reliable here .",
    "the object of this paper is to compute the imaginary part of the retarded current - current correlator , at momentum @xmath14 which is hard ( @xmath15 ) but near the light cone ( @xmath0 ) , at leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "this current - current correlator is related to the dilepton production rate , per lepton species , via and neglecting the lepton mass ] @xcite @xmath16 the calculation requires a resummation of diagrams analogous to that for real photon production .",
    "we first review the integral equation already obtained @xcite in the case of a real photon ( @xmath17 )",
    ". then we extend it to off shell photons .",
    "besides minor kinematic changes to the treatment of @xcite , this also requires inclusion of longitudinally polarized virtual photons .",
    "it is then shown how to obtain an ordinary differential equation by going to impact parameter space , where the equation is solved numerically .",
    "the result is more complete , and in some ways simpler , than the two loop perturbative one .",
    "we find that multiple scattering effects completely remove the @xmath18 threshold behavior found in the perturbative treatment ; the dilepton spectrum is nonsingular and smooth .",
    "finally , we discuss some phenomenological applications .",
    "in this section , we leave aside the production of photons by compton scattering ( @xmath19 ) and annihilation ( @xmath20 ) which appear at one loop in the perturbative expansion of the htl effective theory @xcite and we consider only the processes of type @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes a quark , an antiquark or a gluon .",
    "these appear at the two - loop level but because of a strong collinear enhancement , powers of @xmath24 are generated so that they contribute at the leading order in the strong coupling .",
    "higher order diagrams with a ladder topology involve the same enhancement mechanism [ each new rung in the ladder brings a factor of @xmath25 and therefore they also contribute at leading order .",
    "the summation of these dominant diagrams leads to an integral equation which we now discuss  @xcite .      in @xcite , arnold , moore , and",
    "yaffe summed the set of diagrams of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] , for lightlike external momentum @xmath14 .",

    "generalizing the above equations to the case of the transverse modes of a massive photon is straightforward , as one needs only to replace @xmath46 in @xmath47 by the following combination of the quark mass and the photon invariant mass @xcite : ] if this is not the case , then the kinematics is no longer dominated by small angle scatterings and all of the above equations must be reconsidered .",

    "this is not enough to fully calculate the dilepton production rate ; one must also include the longitudinal mode of the off shell ( virtual ) photon .",
    "we calculate the contribution of this mode in the next subsection .",
    "the contribution of the longitudinal mode can be derived simply by following a procedure similar to the one employed in @xcite .",

    "finally , in figure [ fig : rate - e ] , we display the dilepton rate as a function of the pair energy , the mass @xmath14 being fixed .    at large energy",
    ", one can see the typical exponential drop in @xmath188 .",
    "more precisely , the asymptotic behavior of the dilepton rate at large @xmath48 and fixed @xmath14 is in @xmath189 , the factor @xmath190 being characteristic of the lpm effect at large photon energies .",
    "in addition , increasing the pair mass has the expected effect of making the rate decrease .",
    "note that the curves in this plot are unreliable at the low end , near @xmath191 , since the approximation @xmath192 is certainly invalid in this region .",
    "this is the region where the lepton pair is produced almost at rest in the plasma frame ( @xmath193 ) , which precludes any use of a collinear kinematics .",
    "in this paper we completed the @xmath194 calculation of the rate of low - mass lepton pairs produced at large momentum in a plasma in equilibrium .",
    "production of the pairs in multiple scattering processes are found to be important and even dominate the rate in a wide range of masses .",
    "an interesting result is the absence of a threshold in the mass dependence of the virtual photon : the rescattering processes completely wash out the @xmath11 annihilation threshold naively expected .",
    "the absence of a threshold in the photon invariant mass looks different from the recent results of lattice calculations @xcite where a pronounced threshold is observed in the production of a lepton pair at rest in quark - gluon plasma in equilibrium ( in the quenched approximation ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that we can not directly compare our results to these lattice results , since we consider only low invariant mass dileptons at high energy , that is , @xmath195 close to the light cone ( in the plasma frame ) , while the lattice data presented in @xcite are for dileptons at rest  a regime where our treatment is not valid .",
    "the present results assume that the plasma is in equilibrium , and use asymptotic values for the various thermal and screening masses .",
    "they are therefore expected to be quantitatively reliable only at extremely high temperature .",
    "more realistic results for comparison with present and future experiments at rhic and lhc could be obtained by using more realistic mass estimates , from the lattice for example , and also by relaxing the assumption of chemical equilibrium . of course",
    ", the obtained results would be on a less firm theoretical ground but they might be phenomenologically useful .",
    "the dilepton channel can offer complementary information to the real photon channel as a probe for formation of a quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions , since the background is expected to be relatively much less important than for real photon . in this respect",
    "it would be useful to evaluate the contribution of non thermal sources of lepton pairs for comparison with the rates calculated here .",
    "we wish to thank peter arnold , dominique schiff and larry yaffe for useful conversations .",
    "f.g . would like to thank the lpt / orsay where part of this work has been performed .",
