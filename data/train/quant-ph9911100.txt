    "decoherence is the rapid transformation of a pure linear superposition state into the corresponding statistical mixture @xmath0 this process does not preserve the purity of the state , that is , @xmath1 , and therefore it has to be described in terms of a non - unitary evolution .",
    "the most common approach is the so - called environment - induced decoherence @xcite which is based on the consideration that it is extremely difficult to isolate perfectly a system from uncontrollable degrees of freedom ( the `` environment '' ) .",
    "the non - unitary evolution of the system of interest is obtained by considering the interaction with these uncontrolled degrees of freedom and tracing over them . in this approach ,",
    "decoherence is caused by the entanglement of the two states of the superposition with two approximately orthogonal states of the environment @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 tracing over the environment and using @xmath5 , one gets @xmath6 where @xmath7 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ decoh ] ) .",
    "the environment behaves as a measurement apparatus because the states @xmath8 behave as `` pointer states '' associated with @xmath9 ; in this way the environment acquires `` information '' on the system state and therefore decoherence is described as an irreversible flow of information from the system into the environment @xcite . in this approach , the system energy is usually not conserved and the interaction with the environment also accounts for the irreversible thermalization of the system of interest .",
    "however this approach is inevitably _ model - dependent _ , because one has to assume a model hamiltonian for the environment and the interaction between system and environment .",
    "this modelization , and therefore any quantitative prediction , becomes problematic whenever the environmental degrees of freedom responsible for decoherence are not easily recognizable .",
    "decoherence is not always necessarily due to the entanglement with an environment , but it may be due , as well , to the fluctuations of some classical parameter or internal variable of the system . this kind of decoherence is present even in isolated systems , where environment - induced decoherence has to be neglected . in these cases the system energy is conserved , and one has a different form of decoherence , which we shall call `` non - dissipative decoherence '' . in such cases ,",
    "every single experimental run is characterized by the usual unitary evolution generated by the system hamiltonian . however , definite statistical prediction are obtained only repeating the experiment many times and this is when decoherence takes place , because each run corresponds to a different random value or stochastic realization of the fluctuating classical variable .",
    "the experimental results correspond therefore to an average over these fluctuations and they will describe in general an effective non - unitary evolution .    in this paper we shall present a quite general theory of non - dissipative decoherence for isolated systems which can be applied for two different kinds of fluctuating variables or parameters : the case of a random evolution time and the case of a fluctuating rabi frequency yielding a fluctuation of the hamiltonian . in both cases",
    "one has random phases @xmath10 in the energy eigenstates basis that , once averaged over many experimental runs , lead to the decay of off - diagonal matrix elements of the density operator , while leaving the diagonal ones unchanged .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we shall derive the theory under general assumptions , following closely the original derivation presented in @xcite . in section iii we shall apply this theory in order to describe the decoherence effects observed in two cavity qed experiments performed in paris , one describing rabi oscillations associated with the resonant interaction between a rydberg atom and a microwave cavity mode @xcite , and the second one a ramsey interferometry experiment using a dispersive interaction between the cavity mode and the atom @xcite . in section iv we shall apply our approach to a rabi oscillation experiment for trapped ions @xcite , and section v is for concluding remarks .",
    "the formalism describing non - dissipative decoherence of isolated systems has been derived in @xcite by considering the case of a system with random evolution time .",
    "the evolution time may be random because of the finite time needed to prepare the initial state of the system , because of the randomness of the detection time , as well as many other reasons .",
    "for example , in cavity qed experiments , the evolution time is the interaction time , which is determined by the time of flight of the atoms within the cavity and this time can be random due to atomic velocity dispersion .    in these cases ,",
    "the experimental observations are not described by the usual density matrix of the whole system @xmath11 , but by its time averaged counterpart @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the usual unitarily evolved density operator from the initial state and @xmath14/ \\hbar$ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath15 denotes the random evolution time , while @xmath16 is a parameter describing the usual `` clock '' time . using eq .",
    "( [ robar ] ) , one can write @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the evolution operator for the averaged state of the system . following ref .  @xcite , we determine the function @xmath19 by imposing the following plausible conditions : i ) @xmath20 must be a density operator , i.e. it must be self - adjoint , positive - definite , and with unit - trace .",
    "this leads to the condition that @xmath19 must be non - negative and normalized , i.e a probability density in @xmath15 so that eq .",

    "ii ) @xmath21 satisfies the semigroup property @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the semigroup condition is satisfied by an exponential dependence on @xmath16 @xmath24 where @xmath25 naturally appears as a scaling time .",
    "a solution satisfying all the conditions we have imposed can be found by separating @xmath26 in its hermitian and antihermitian part @xmath27 and by considering the gamma function integral identity @xcite @xmath28 now the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gammaid ] ) can be identified with the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ viditi ] ) if we impose the following conditions : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is another scaling time , generally different from @xmath31 ; @xmath32 in order to make the exponential terms identical , and @xmath33 in order to get a normalized probability distribution @xmath19 .",
    "this choice yields the following expressions for the evolution operator for the averaged density matrix @xmath21 and for the probability density @xmath34 @xcite @xmath35 notice that the ordinary quantum evolution is recovered when @xmath36 ; in this limit @xmath37 so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the usual unitary evolution .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ fund ] ) implies that @xmath20 satisfies a finite difference equation @xcite .",
    "the semigroup condition leads to the form of the probability distribution @xmath34 we use to perform the average on the fluctuating evolution times .",
    "however , notice that this probability distribution depends on both the two scaling times @xmath30 and @xmath31 only apparently .",
    "in fact , if we change variable in the time integral , @xmath40 , it is possible to rewrite the integral expression for @xmath21 in the following way @xmath41 where @xmath42 this probability density depends only on @xmath31 .",
    "however eq .",
    "( [ chvar ] ) contains an effective _ rescaled _ time evolution generator @xmath43 .",
    "the physical meaning of the probability distribution of eq .",
    "( [ pdue ] ) , of the rescaled evolution operator , and of the two scaling times can be understood if we consider the following simple example .",
    "let us consider a system with hamiltonian @xmath44 , where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the heaviside step function ) , that is , a system with hamiltonian @xmath47 which is periodically applied for a time @xmath30 , with time period @xmath31 ( @xmath48 ) and which is `` turned off '' otherwise .",
    "the unitary evolution operator for this system is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 which can be however well approximated by the `` rescaled '' evolution operator @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , the maximum relative error in replacing @xmath53 with @xmath54 is @xmath55 and becomes negligible at large times ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this fact suggests to interpret the time average of eq .",
    "( [ chvar ] ) as an average over unitary evolutions generated by @xmath56 , taking place randomly in time , with mean time width @xmath30 , and separated by a mean time interval @xmath31 .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the fact that when @xmath57 , for integer @xmath58 , the probability distribution @xmath59 of eq .",
    "( [ pdue ] ) is a known statistical distribution giving the probability density that the waiting time for @xmath58 independent events is @xmath60 when @xmath31 is the mean time interval between two events . a particularly clear example of the random process in time implied by the above equations is provided by the micromaser @xcite in which a microwave cavity is crossed by a beam of resonant atoms with mean injection rate @xmath61 , and a mean interaction time within the cavity corresponding to @xmath62 . in the micromaser theory ,",
    "the non unitary operator @xmath63 describing the effective dynamics of the microwave mode during each atomic crossing replaces the evolution operator @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "another example of interrupted evolution is provided by the experimental scheme proposed in @xcite for the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement @xcite of the photon number in a high - q cavity . in this proposal ,",
    "the photon number is determined by measuring the phase shift induced on a train of rydberg atoms sent through the microwave cavity with mean rate @xmath65 , and interacting dispersively with the cavity mode .",
    "these two examples show that the two scaling times @xmath30 and @xmath31 have not to be considered as new universal constants , but as two characteristic times of the system under study .",
    "however , in most cases , one does not have an interrupted evolution as in micromaser - like situations , but a standard , continuous evolution generated by an hamiltonian @xmath66 . in this case",
    "the `` scaled '' effective evolution operator has to coincide with the usual one , @xmath56 , and this is possible only if @xmath67 . in this case",
    "@xmath68 is simply the parameter characterizing the strength of the fluctuations of the random evolution time .",
    "this meaning of the parameter @xmath69 in the case of equal scaling times is confirmed by the expressions of the mean and the variance of the probability distribution of eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) @xmath70 when @xmath71 , the mean evolution time coincide with the  clock ` ' time @xmath16 , while the variance of the evolution time becomes @xmath72 . in the rest of the paper we shall always consider the standard situation of an isolated system with hamiltonian @xmath66 , continuously evolving in time , and we shall always assume @xmath73 .",
    "when @xmath74 , @xmath39 is the usual unitary evolution . for finite @xmath68 , on the contrary , the evolution equation ( [ fund ] ) describes a decay of the off - diagonal matrix elements in the energy representation , whereas the diagonal matrix elements remain constant , i.e. the energy is still a constant of motion . in fact , in the energy eigenbasis , eqs .",
    "( [ robar2 ] ) and ( [ fund ] ) yield @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 this means that , in general , the effect of the average over the fluctuating evolution time yields an exponential decay and a frequency shift @xmath78 of every term oscillating in time with frequency @xmath79 .    the phase diffusion aspects of the present approach can also be seen if the evolution equation of the averaged density matrix @xmath20 is considered .",
    "in fact , by differentiating with respect to time eq .",
    "( [ robar2 ] ) and using ( [ fund ] ) , one gets the following master equation for @xmath20 ( we consider the case @xmath80 ) @xmath81 expanding the logarithm at second order in @xmath82 , one obtains @xmath83-\\frac{\\tau}{2\\hbar^2}\\left [ h,\\left[h,\\bar{\\rho}(t)\\right ] \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{ropun2}\\ ] ] which is the well - known phase - destroying master equation @xcite .",

    "( [ fund ] ) one has to take the first determination of the power - law function and in this way @xmath21 is univocally defined .",
    "a first experimental situation in which the above formalism can be applied is the rabi oscillation experiment of ref .",

    "this decay of quantum coherence can not be associated with photon leakage out of the cavity because the cavity relaxation time is larger ( @xmath101 @xmath102sec ) and also because in this case one would have an asymptotic limit @xmath103 .",

    ", they do not recover the scaling ( [ o7 ] ) of the decay rates @xmath188 only because they do not use the general expression of the rabi frequency ( [ omn ] ) , ( and which is well approximated by the power law ( [ o35 ] ) ) but its lamb - dicke limit @xmath217 , which is valid only when @xmath218 .",
    "there is however another , more fundamental , difference between our approach and that of ref .",
    "@xcite . they assume from the beginning that the laser intensity fluctuations have a white and gaussian character , while we make no _ a priori _ assumption on the statistical properties of the pulse area @xmath204 .",
    "we derive these properties , i.e. the probability distribution ( [ agamma ] ) , only from the semigroup condition , and it is interesting to note that this condition yields a gaussian probability distribution for the pulse area only as a limiting case .",

    "( [ agamma ] ) one can see that @xmath209 tends to become a gaussian with the same mean value @xmath219 and the same width @xmath220 only in the large time limit @xmath221 @xmath222 the non - gaussian character of @xmath209 can be traced back to the fact that @xmath209 must be definite and normalized in the interval @xmath223 and not in @xmath224 . notice that at @xmath225 , eq .",

    "( [ ropun ] ) significantly depart from its second order expansion in @xmath82 , eq .",

    "@xcite can be repeated for the very recent experiment with trapped ions performed in innsbruck @xcite , in which rabi oscillations involving the vibrational levels and an optical quadrupole transition of a single @xmath228ca@xmath229 ion have been observed .",
    "damped oscillations corresponding to initial vibrational numbers @xmath193 and @xmath230 are reported . from the data with @xmath193 , @xmath231 khz and @xmath232 khz",
    ", we get @xmath233 and this estimate is consistent with attributing again the decoherence to the fluctuations of the rabi frequency caused by laser intensity fluctuations .",
    "moreover in this case , the experiment is performed in the lamb - dicke limit @xmath218 , and therefore , using again eq .",
    "( [ gammapr ] ) , we expect , in this case , a linear scaling with the vibrational number , @xmath234 .",
    "decoherence is not always necessarily due to the entanglement with an environment , but it may be due , as well , to the fluctuations of some classical parameter or internal variable of a system .",
    "this is a different form of decoherence , which is present even in isolated systems , and that we have called non - dissipative decoherence . in this paper",
    "we have presented a model - independent theory for non - dissipative decoherence , which can be applied in the case of a random evolution time or in the case of a fluctuating hamiltonian .",
    "this approach proves to be a flexible tool , able to give a quantitative understanding of the decoherence caused by the fluctuations of classical quantities .",
    "in fact , in this paper we have given a simple and _ unified _ description of the decoherence phenomenon observed in recent rabi oscillation experiments performed in a cavity qed configuration @xcite and on a trapped ion @xcite .",
    "in particular , this approach has allowed us to explain for the first time in simple terms , the power - law scaling of the coherence decay rates of eq .",
    "( [ o7 ] ) , observed in the trapped ion experiment .    the relevant aspect of the approach applied here , and introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is its model - independence .",
    "the formalism is in fact derived starting from few , very general assumptions : i ) the average density matrix @xmath20 has all the usual properties of a density matrix ; ii ) the semigroup property for the time evolution generator @xmath21 for @xmath20 . with this respect",
    ", this approach seems to provide a very general description of non - dissipative decoherence , in which the random properties of the fluctuating classical variables are characterized by the two , system - dependent , time parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as we have seen in section ii , in the cases where one has a standard , continuous evolution ,",
    "the two times coincide @xmath80 . under ideal conditions of no fluctuating classical variable or parameter",
    ", one would have @xmath235 , and the usual unitary evolution of an isolated system in quantum mechanics would be recovered .",
    "however , the generality of the approach suggests in some way the possibility that the parameter @xmath68 , even though system - dependent , might have a lower _ nonzero _ limit , which would be reached just in the case of no fluctuations of experimental origin .",
    "this would mean a completely new description of time in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , the evolution time of a system @xmath15 ( and not the `` clock '' time @xmath16 ) would become an intrinsically random variable with a well defined probability distribution , _ without _ the difficulty of introducing an evolution time operator . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is suggested a relation of the nonzero limit for @xmath69 with the `` energy - time '' @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the uncertainty in energy .",
    "this would give a precise meaning to the time - energy uncertainty relation because now @xmath69 rules the width of the time distribution function .",
    "however , this `` intrinsic assumption '' is not necessarily implied by the formalism developed in @xcite and applied , with a more pragmatic attitude , in the present paper .",
