    "many types of disorder in ferromagnets and ferroelectrics can induce spin- or dipole - glass states if emergent random interactions cause frustration and make the ground state of a crystal highly degenerate @xcite . besides the classic example of the solid solution ( alloy ) of ferromagnet with antiferromagnet @xcite it can be the random anisotropy @xcite , simple dilution in the case of competing nearest and next - nearest interactions @xcite or in the presence of strong dipole - dipole ones @xcite as well as structural defects such as dislocations @xcite .",
    "now it is widely recognized that the unusual nonergodic properties of disordered ferromagnets and ferroelectrics in their glassy phases result from the appearance of a number of metastable states each having more or less random directions of local spontaneous electric or magnetic dipole moments @xcite . using the different protocols of changing temperature and external field ( e. g. field - cooled , fc , zero - field cooled , zfc , etc . )",
    "one may arrive at the metastable states with different net magnetization ( polarization ) and differences in other thermodynamic functions .",
    "first adequate theoretical description of such history - dependence of system properties in glassy phases was achieved in refs .",
    "[ , ] using numerical simulations in the local mean - field theory of random - bond magnets .",
    "it was explicitly shown that various regimes of temperature and field variations do bring system to different minima of thermodynamic potential thus providing the history - dependence of thermodynamic functions . under the assumption of the possibility of sufficiently slow ( quasi - static ) variations of external parameters making the predictions of static thermodynamic theory",
    "valid the number of nonergodic features of glassy phases were described in refs .",
    "[ , ] : the temperature dependencies of fc and zfc functions , thermal and isothermal remanent magnetizations , the form of hysteresis loops , fc heat capacity in different fields .",
    "these results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data for a series of random magnets .",
    "later the method of the local mean - field simulations were used to reveal the presence of nonergodic reentrant spin - glass phase in 2d xy random - bond model @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies of nonergodic phenomena in spin systems with random interactions were mainly focused on numerical simulations of hysteresis loops .",
    "the smaller loops inside the main one and evolution via macroscopic spin avalanches on the main loop are shown to exist in edwards - anderson @xcite and sherrington- kirkpatrick @xcite spin - glass models .",
    "the existence of hysteresis loops is established in random - anisotropy model @xcite .",
    "the new hard - spin mean - field method is developed for frustrated random - bond systems @xcite which provides the evidences for the existence of multiple metastable states and can describe a number of nonergodic phenomena with less simulation efforts .    in spite of definite successes in numerical simulations of nonergodic effects in glassy phases these methods are not destined to provide some general picture for systematization and qualitative explanation of these effects .",
    "it is rather difficult to find from the existing numerical results the possible interrelations between a variety of history - dependent phenomena observed in different experimental regimes , see refs . [ - ] .",
    "yet it seems that they should be necessary present as , e. g. , the hysteresis loops and zfc - fc magnetization differences have the common origin .",
    "then one may hope to obtain the unified picture of such phenomena using analytical calculations in some simplified models .",
    "but nowadays there are no simple enough microscopic models in which nonergodic effects in finite field could be described by the analytical methods .",
    "thus in present situation some phenomenological approach may help to achieve general understanding of the quasi - static large field response in glassy phases and the role played in it by metastable states .",
    "apparently , it should be based on some realistic mechanism underlying the appearance of such states .",
    "such mechanism for the random - interaction systems has been described in ref . [ ] .",
    "it consists in the subsequent condensations of numerous sparse fractal modes defined by the eigenvectors of the random matrix of pair - wise interactions ( exchange matrix in magnets or the matrix of harmonic interaction of polar atomic displacements in ferroelectrics ) at their localization threshold @xcite . in random ferroelectrics ( relaxors )",
    "these modes play the role of the notorious `` soft mode '' as they are the delocalized eigenmodes of polar atomic oscillation with the lowest frequencies .",
    "their amplitudes throughout the disordered crystal can be obtained by the numerical methods of refs . [ ] . the condensation ( freezing ) of these modes in relaxors results in appearance of stable polar atomic displacements same as in the case of ordinary soft mode albeit these displacements are highly inhomogeneous and sparse .",
    "their analogs in random ising magnets can be related to the delocalized relaxational magnetic modes which freeze first at a macroscopic spin glass transition .",
    "it is important to realize that only the freezing of these macroscopic modes can result in emergence of stable spontaneous local moments at a glass transition .",
    "such objects as nano - domains will never have spontaneous moments stable for a macroscopic time so this notion is useless for the description of the true thermodynamic transition into the glass phase .",
    "thus burns temperature in relaxors at which experiments reveal the appearance of ( fluctuating ) polar nano - domains marks the onset of the paraelectric griffiths phase in which only non - analyticity in the field dependence of polarization @xcite and slow non - exponential relaxation @xcite appear .",
    "the suggested mechanism of a macroscopic spin glass transition is in sharp contrast with that of phase transition in homogeneous crystals .",
    "the last takes place due to the condensation of just one periodic or uniform in space eigenmode which corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of exchange matrix ( in magnets ) or the lowest eigenvalue of the matrix of effective harmonic interaction ( soft mode in ferroelectrics ) . in ideal crystal",
    "it is sufficient to stabilize the other modes with eigenvalues close to the critical one throughout some low - symmetry phase regions .",
    "this stabilization of the rest of near - critical modes results from nonlinear mode couplings which are always present if there is some finite spatial overlap between the critical mode and near - critical ones .",
    "as all eigenmodes of an ideal crystal is just the plane waves strongly overlapping throughout the whole sample , the condensation of just one critical mode makes the system stable .    in a strongly disordered crystal with random interactions",
    "the situation changes principally .",
    "the randomness of pair - wise interactions makes the eigenmodes near the boundary of the spectrum localized @xcite so the transition may start only with the condensation of the first delocalized eigenmode at the localization threshold somewhat far from the lower boundary of the spectrum . owing to the sparse fractal structure of the modes near this threshold @xcite , the condensation of the first delocalized mode can not stabilize the other sparse near - critical modes which do not overlap essentially with the first one .",
    "so they proceed to condense at slightly lower temperatures until almost all crystal sites acquire spontaneous moments .",
    "if the average fractal dimension of these condensing modes is @xmath0 , the average number of sites participating in each mode is of the order @xmath1 .",
    "so the number of them needed to cover the @xmath2-site crystal is @xmath3 .",
    "thus strong disorder can transform the ordinary phase transition into the macroscopic number of them spreading in some temperature interval . as each mode",
    "after condensation can have ( at least ) two stable states with the reverse directions of local moments , we may end up with up to @xmath4 metastable states .",
    "note that each of these numerous subsequent transitions is still a macroscopic one as the macroscopic number of local spontaneous moments of order @xmath5 appears at it .",
    "apparently , the mean - field estimate of the potential barrier between metastable states would also give the macroscopic value proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "here we may note that above picture describes only the possibility of emergence of numerous metastable states in crystal with random interactions .",
    "do it actually realizes depends on the details of pair - wise interaction between the sparse fractal modes .",
    "if this interaction tends to orient the net moments of the modes in parallel , we may have ordinary ferromagnetic ( ferroelectric ) phase with or without some metastable states .",
    "principally , sketched above mechanism allows for phenomenological description of the thermodynamics of metastable states in the spirit of landau s theory of phase transitions .",
    "the case with purely glass transition was considered in ref .",
    "here we present the simplified and more general derivation of the phenomenological landau s potential for the generic case of competing ferromagnetic ( ferroelectric ) and glassy interactions in disordered crystals . for a large class of such random systems it is possible to obtain semi - analytical description of the properties of the emergent metastable states thus providing the comprehensive account of possible nonergodic effects in random ferromagnets and ferroelectric relaxors .",
    "further we mainly resort to the magnetic terminology and designations just to be specific .",
    "let us consider the ferromagnet with the second - order transition and one - component order parameter where some disorder of random - interaction type presents tending to destroy the ferromagnetic order . according to above considerations we can introduce in this case the landau potential for some specific realization of disorder depending on the net magnetizations of sparse fractal modes ,",
    "if the temperature interval ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) at which the condensation of these modes takes place is narrow , @xmath9 then we can consider the small @xmath10 near @xmath11 and expand the potential @xmath12 in powers of @xmath10 .",
    "it would contain only even powers of these order parameters due to the global inversion symmetry .",
    "also we can retain in it the terms with no more than two different modes as one can suggest that their sparse spatial structure makes the simultaneous interactions of three or more modes negligibly small .    further we may note that @xmath13 is actually the necessary condition when one consider the frustrating disorder causing the ( near ) degeneracy of condensing types of magnetic ( dipole ) arrangements .",
    "this means that in such case the condensing modes have nearly the same thermodynamic potentials , close transition temperatures and thermodynamic parameters .",
    "the simplest way to imitate this near degeneracy is to suppose that all thermodynamic properties of all modes are identical",
    ". then @xmath14 should be symmetric under all permutations of @xmath10 .",
    "the immediate effect of this assumption will be the merging of actually subsequent transitions to just one point , @xmath11 . in this way we avoid the consideration of narrow temperature interval ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and gain the significant simplification of the model which still preserve the essential features of nonergodic transitions caused by frustrating disorder .",
    "we may say that model with permutation symmetry is the `` minimal '' one and , probably , the simplest model allowing for more or less adequate account of real nonergodic effects in large class of random ferromagnets and ferroelectric relaxors .    at last , the quadratic terms of the potential should reflect the competition between ferromagnetic ( ferroelectric ) and glassy orders .",
    "thus we arrive at the unique form of potential up to forth order in @xmath10 obeying the above criteria , @xmath15 here @xmath16 is external field conjugate to the net magnetization of a sample @xmath17 note that this relation is the consequence of the adopted principle of mode equivalence which includes the supposition of equal numbers of sites participating in each mode .",
    "@xmath18 in the denominators of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ensure the equal order of different terms contributions at large @xmath19 .",
    "note also the absence in ( 1 ) the term @xmath20 allowed formally by the above criteria .",
    "it can be removed by the linear transform of @xmath10 resulting in rescaling of @xmath16 and @xmath21 and appearance of two forth - order terms with three- and four - mode interactions which must be dropped due to assumed smallness of such interactions .",
    "thus the presence in @xmath22 of this term amounts just to the @xmath16 and @xmath21 rescaling and it can be omitted .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath22 are some constants specific for a given disorder realization , while @xmath21 and @xmath25 are linear decreasing functions of temperature @xmath26 changing their signs at temperatures @xmath27 and @xmath11 correspondingly also being disorder dependent . yet in the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic solid solutions all potential parameters must be the self - averaging quantities .",
    "it means that they depend only on the impurities concentrations in accordance with the experimental data showing no noticeable variations of the properties of different samples with the same composition .",
    "here we should note that this is true only for the solid solutions with deeply frozen disorder . in the relaxors with",
    "annealing mediated ordering of components such as psn the parameters of the potential will also depend on the degree of ordering achieved at the high - temperature annealing .",
    "generally , the crystal with negligible disorder should have @xmath28 as in this case we may have just the ordinary transition into homogeneous ferro - phase without any traces of disorder .",
    "so the growth of disorder will result in the increase of @xmath11 along with the lowering of @xmath29 .",
    "the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath11 must be small to make the expansion of @xmath22 in small @xmath10 meaningful . according to eq .",

    "thus the states with @xmath85 have the lowest potential at @xmath96 while the global minimum is at the states with @xmath80 at @xmath97 .",

    "it defines a straight line on ( @xmath83 ) plane which crystal follows under @xmath26 variations and , hence , the phase sequence proper for a given crystal .",
    "for example , if the relation @xmath101 holds , @xmath102 being some constant , the crystal undergoes just one second - order transition - into the ordinary ferro - phase if @xmath103 or in the glass phase if @xmath104 . in the first case",
    "there is another qualitative change of thermodynamic properties ( not a phase transition ) - the subsequent appearance of numerous metastable states in addition to ferro - state begins when crystal reaches the regions of their stability belonging to the sector ( [ eq:13 ] ) . yet in these cases the application of field causes no drastic changes in the temperature dependencies of @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 apart from the usual differences in their fc and zfc values .",
    "much more pronounced field effects occur when the path on ( @xmath108 ) plane intersects the line @xmath98 .",
    "then glass or ferro - phase can appear as intermediate one in some finite temperature interval neighboring para - phase and first - order transition between them takes place at @xmath98 .",
    "yet there are also different temperature behavior when path crosses the region of coexistence of ferro- and glass states ( the sector in fig . 1 bounded by the dashed lines ) and when it always stays in this region .",
    "these four principally different paths are shown in fig .",
    "dotted lines in it correspond to paths @xmath109 ( a and @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 ( b and @xmath112 ) which we use further to present some typical temperature variations of thermodynamic variables which differ essentially on them .",
    "the spin - glass phase on paths b and @xmath112 is often called `` reentrant '' as crystal returns again on cooling to the equilibrium state with zero net magnetization . the possible microscopic mechanism of such reentrance",
    "is considered in ref .",
    "we must note that here the first - order transition does not mean that at @xmath98 the crystal do jump from one state to another on the laboratory time scale .",
    "actually it must traverse the rough potential landscape and to overcome on the way a number of macroscopic barriers between the local minima ( partially ordered states ) to arrive to the global minimum .",
    "it takes an infinite time and the standard thermodynamics indeed predicts formally what will happen after infinite time when system will be fully relaxed .",
    "but actually one has just finite laboratory time to measure the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "it is quite usual situations in all nonergodic systems ( i. e. those with metastable states ) - they all have infinite ( arrhenius ) relaxation time for the decay of metastable states into stable one irrespective of their number - to traverse just one macroscopic barrier also needs an infinite time the same as to traverse many of them .",
    "this circumstance causes no difficulties in the application of the results of the equilibrium thermodynamics to the known nonergodic systems such as ordinary ferroelectric and ferromagnets in their ferro - phases .",
    "the simple example is the description of hysteresis loop . here",
    "the infinite - time thermodynamic prediction that spontaneous magnetization should reverse its direction just when the field change its sign is easily modified with due account of the long - living metastable states ( in which field and magnetization have opposite signs ) .",
    "as they can not relax to the global minimum at the laboratory time and persist until they become unstable ( at the coercive fields ) one just include them in the description of the response to sufficiently slow ( quasi - static ) field thus obtaining upper and lower branches of hysteresis loop .",
    "apparently , to apply the results of static thermodynamic to the dynamic process of field variation we must be sure that during it the system stays close to a local minimum .",
    "hence , in this case the quasi - static condition means that the characteristic time of field variations is greater than the magnetization relaxation time in a local minimum .    in the same way we can get the description of quasi - static responses from the thermodynamic results for the present model . to do",
    "this one must assume that quasi - static regimes can be attained experimentally , i. e. that sufficiently slow temperature or field variations can be achieved on the laboratory time scale which ensure the location of system near some minimum during these variations .",
    "then we just should take into account that once the system entered the metastable state it can not leave it in such quasi - static processes until that state becomes unstable .",
    "hence , the validity of this picture of the temperature evolution in which crystal is trapped in a local minimum and has the obtained above thermodynamic parameters crucially depends on the rate of cooling or heating .",
    "it should be sufficiently small to provide the quasi - static evolution of the system , that is the characteristic time of temperature variations , @xmath113 , must be greater than the largest magnetic relaxation time in the specific minimum .",
    "the same is true for characteristic time of field variations .",
    "one may expect that when we are not close to @xmath11 nearly homogeneously magnetized states with @xmath114 would have rather moderate relaxation times comparable to those the crystal has deep in para - phase . also far from @xmath11",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of highly disordered states with @xmath115 may be very small making the amplitude of magnetization relaxation in them small too .",
    "then we would observe their nearly static parameters even for @xmath116 less than relaxation times which can spread up to huge macroscopic values in such states .",
    "if @xmath106 reaches large values close to @xmath11 in the states with low @xmath115 their thermodynamic description would become useless due to the strong aging effects in them .",
    "then one should necessarily resort to the dynamic theory to get the adequate account of their ( dynamic ) properties .",
    "provided the above quasi - static conditons are fullfilled another question inherent to such highly nonergodic systems arises - to which of numerous stable states the system will go after its present state becomes unstable ? strictly speaking , one should again turn to the dynamics to answer it , yet , as we will see , there is actually no vast choice of possibilities in the framework of the heuristic assumption that system adopts the most smooth variations of its average magnetization .",
    "thus crystal can stay in metastable state for a very large ( arrhenius ) time and leave it only when it becomes unstable . before this the only way to bring the nonergodic crystal to some other state is to apply the external field which could make the present state unstable .",
    "this circumstance made former investigators to believe that ferroelectric relaxors have no phase transitions exhibiting only `` field - induced '' ferroelectricity @xcite .",
