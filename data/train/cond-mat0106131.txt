    "at low temperatures , disordered or chaotic electronic systems are strongly affected by mechanisms of quantum interference .",
    "these interference effects manifest themselves in anomalously strong fluctuations of both thermodynamic and transport observables and in the spatial localization of quantum mechanical wave functions  @xcite .",
    "they find their common origin in an interplay of the classical nonintegrability of the charge carrier dynamics and the wave nature of quantum mechanical propagation . to quantitatively characterize this ` mesoscopic ' behavior , one commonly employs correlation functions of the type @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the retarded / advanced single - particle green function . here",
    "@xmath2 stands for some kind of averaging ( e.g. , averaging over realizations of disorder ) and the parameter @xmath3 symbolically represents an optional dependence of the green function on external control parameters ( magnetic fields , gate voltages or others ) .",
    "correlation functions of this type appear as the ` most microscopic ' building block in the analysis of the majority of fluctuating mesoscopic observables . as a consequence of constructive quantum interference",
    "these objects become long ranged whenever the spatial arguments @xmath4 are pairwise close ( on scales of @xmath5 , the range of the averaged green functions @xmath6 ) .",

    "this is the generalized ` diffuson ' , a quantity of key relevance in the context of mesoscopic transport . *",
    "finally , in a system with unbroken time reversal symmetry , @xmath14}(\\x,\\x ' ) \\equiv f(\\x,\\x',\\x,\\x')$ ] , the cooperon , becomes long ranged , too .    the dependence of the correlators @xmath15}$ ] on the long - ranged distance @xmath16 , the energy difference @xmath17 , and @xmath18 fundamentally characterizes a multitude of mesoscopic phenomena  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , many _ theoretical _ investigations in mesoscopic physics concentrate on an analysis of these objects .",
    "experimentally , however , it has proven difficult to access the correlation functions @xmath15}$ ] directly : ideally , one would like to _ continuously _ measure the dependence of the correlators @xmath15}$ ] over a range of at least the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "irritatingly , this can not be achieved within experimental setups based on a standard device - contact - electron system architecture .",
    "in fact , the mere presence of local contacts introduces an entire spectrum of difficulties obstructing the continuous experimental spectroscopy of transport and spectral correlation functions : first , the _ fixed _ attachment of local current / voltage electrodes prevents one from continuously monitoring the scale ( @xmath19 ) dependence of transport correlation functions .",
    "this problem does not exist in measurements based on local tunneling tips  @xcite . in those ,",
    "however , the electronic state of the tunneling device as well as its coupling to the electron system have to be precisely known to draw quantitatively reliable conclusions on the nature of the bulk electronic correlations of the latter . in particular , the distance between the device and the electron system has to be kept constant with atomic precision .",
    "these conditions can hardly be met under realistic conditions .",
    "second , both local contacts and tunneling tips tend to disturb the electron system under investigation . in interacting systems",
    ", they lead to various manifestations of the orthogonality catastrophe . as a consequence ,",
    "much of the measured current / voltage characteristics describes the process of local accommodation of charge carriers at the interface , rather than the electronic correlations of the bulk system .",
    "third , a division between system and contacts of a mesoscopic conductor is , to a large extent , arbitrary .",
    "quantum interference phenomena in mesoscopic systems tend to be highly nonlocal in space , and often it is not clear , where the physical processes responsible for the outcome of an experiment took place , in the ` device ' , the ` contacts ' , or all over the place .",
    "these problems with contacted systems and local tunneling devices led to the idea to use a second electron system with essentially known properties as an _ extended _ tunneling spectroscope  @xcite .",
    "setups of such type can conveniently be realized in double - quantum - well structures embedded in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ setup ] : two electron systems confined in parallel wells separated by an isolating barrier of uniform thickness @xmath20 nm form a double - layer system of two two - dimensional electron systems .",
    "a tunneling current @xmath21 from one layer to the other is driven by applying a voltage difference @xmath22 between them .",
    "the tunneling region is typically a few @xmath23 @xmath24m@xmath25 in extent . in the absence of any disorder scattering and/or tunneling amplitude inhomogeneities , the tunneling from one layer to the other can only occur if energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "this leads to the resonant behavior of the tunneling current that is characteristic of two - dimensional systems . more generally , for constrained geometries ( e.g. , quantum wire / two - dimensional electron system ) the field dependence of these resonances can be analyzed to obtain information on the dispersion of the fundamental excitations in the two systems  @xcite .",
    "however , in ` real ' systems , inhomogeneities in the tunneling barrier thickness , static disorder , and other non - momentum conserving imperfections will lead to modifications of the idealized resonant current profile . of these intruding mechanisms ,",
    "the first appears to be the most serious : the current will respond with exponential sensitivity to any fluctuations of the layer separation ; for strong enough spatial variations one may run into a scenario , where tunneling occurs only at a sparse set of ` hot spots ' , with no traces of a resonant profile left@xcite .",
    "( some characteristics of this type of current flow will be discussed below . )",
    "however , recent technological advances have made it possible to manufacture double - well systems with near - monolayer precision . in such devices , fluctuations in the tunneling matrix elements",
    "are reduced down to values of @xmath26  @xcite and can be absorbed into a renormalization of the effective in - plane disorder . in the present paper ,",
    "the focus will be on transport in these near - planar devices .",
    "even if the tunneling is homogeneous , static disorder will broaden the resonant behavior and introduce fluctuations .",
    "the broadening of the average current is related to the dynamics on short time scales  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fluctuations contain information about physical processes on much larger time scales  @xcite of the order of , e.g. , the diffusion time through the system .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the nature of these fluctuations and their relation to the aforementioned electronic correlation functions .",
    "in fact , we will see below that detailed information on the correlation functions @xmath15}$ ] can be extracted from the tunneling current fluctuations without disturbing the system . moreover , ( i ) the tunneling takes place uniformly at all points of the layers which means that an averaging over spatially fluctuating structures ( e.g. , details of the microscopic wave function amplitudes ) is intrinsic to the data contained in the current .",
    "( ii ) several parameters can be tuned to gain information : the bias voltage resolves energetic correlations , a parallel magnetic field resolves spatial correlations , and a perpendicular magnetic field may serve as a control parameter for parametric correlations ( i.e. , correlations between green functions evaluated at different values of external control parameters ) .",
    "( iii ) the geometry of the layers can be designed freely , so that it is possible to study different regimes of particle dynamics ( e.g. , ergodic , ballistic , diffusive , etc . ) .    in this work , after the introduction of the general theoretical background of the tunneling current statistics , we will consider two prototypical system classes .",
    "first , we study extended systems for which the phase coherence length @xmath27 is much larger than the microscopic length @xmath28 and a crossover or a transition from diffusive motion to anderson localization may take place . for such systems , a parallel magnetic field @xmath29 can be employed as an instrument for resolving the long - range behavior of the correlation functions @xmath30}$ ] .",
    "importantly , the field alignment parallel to the two - dimensional planes implies that the charge carrier dynamics is not affected by @xmath29 .",
    "while in the diffusive regime explicit expressions for the correlation functions are known , no quantitative expressions for regimes with strong ( nonperturbative ) localization and interaction effects are available .",
    "however , in a regime of localization - delocalization crossover or transition , scaling behavior is expected to restrict the functional form of @xmath30}$ ] .",
    "this opens the possibility to extract the relevant critical indices from tunneling conductance measurements .",
    "second , we study a geometry , where one of the layers forms a ballistic quantum dot ( @xmath31 ) in the ergodic regime",
    ". the other , extended , layer serves as the spectrometer .",
    "for the quantum dot , the parametric correlations with respect to a perpendicular magnetic field , present in @xmath15}$ ] , can be obtained from the current fluctuations .",
    "a similar setup has already been realized experimentally by sivan et al .",
    "@xcite . in that work , a single level ( in contrast to our extended system ) was used as a spectrometer to study a quantum dot device .",
    "this experiment led to results for the functional form of the correlator @xmath9}$ ] , compatible with theoretical predictions from random matrix theory .",
    "however , one would expect that the data obtained from single - level spectroscopy is still weighted with nonuniversal wave - function amplitudes specific to the isolated ` monitor level ' .",
    "in contrast , for the two - dimensional layer / quantum dot setup considered here , the current flow is extended and spatially uniform . as a consequence ,",
    "the tunneling current fluctuations are microscopically related to the purely spectral content of parametric correlations .",
    "below we will establish the quantitative connection between the field and voltage dependence of the tunneling current fluctuations and a number of correlation functions that have been analyzed in the recent theoretical literature  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will try to assess to what extent these connections , obtained for the chaotic noninteracting electron gas , may be susceptible to interaction mechanisms such as coulomb drag@xcite or coulomb blockade effects  @xcite .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , the total current flowing at the split peaks ( positioned at @xmath96 ) equals the peak current at @xmath94 in the absence of interactions .",
    "this observation implies that interactions in these experiments largely manifest themselves in the form of self - energy corrections to the single - particle poles . in contrast , if strong interlayer correlation effects were present , the peak current would increase .",
    "indeed , for strong interlayer correlations , the momenta of the particle and the hole constituting the ` current - loop ' would be partially correlated .",
    "this should lead to gradual resurrection of the resonant behavior characteristic for the clean case and , therefore , to an unsplit zero - bias conductance peak .",

    "however , the ( imaginary time ) green functions @xmath269 , we actually wish to compute , being non - gauge invariant objects , pick up a gauge factor @xmath270 to be specified momentarily . for temperatures larger than the level spacing ,",

    "equation ( [ res - int ] ) represents the most general form of our result for the correlation function in the presence of a charging interaction . to understand the structure of this expression , and to identify physically distinct regimes , we realize that @xmath282 depends on four characteristic energy scales : the temperature @xmath32 , the charging energy @xmath237 , the bias voltage @xmath22 , and an intrinsic scale @xmath283 over which the non - interacting correlator @xmath255 varies .",
    "notice that the dependence on @xmath22 is implicit , through the limits imposed on the variables @xmath242 and @xmath17 .    to exemplify the dependence of the correlator on these scales ,",

    "this expression displays a feature common to _ all _ correlation functions @xmath282 affected by charging : formerly sharp energy dependences are broadened to gaussians of width @xmath288 .",
    "in other words , energetically sharp features of @xmath289 are washed out and a lower limit to what can be resolved in an experiment is set .    to make further progress",
    ", we have to distinguish between two different regimes : ( a ) weak interaction or high temperature , @xmath290 and ( b ) strong interaction or low temperature , @xmath291 .",
    "we begin by discussing the first case , ( a ) .    for @xmath290 ,",
    "interaction corrections are small and an expansion to first order in the parameter @xmath292 obtains @xmath293 where @xmath294 stands for an energy average of the noninteracting correlator @xmath289 , over a scale @xmath295 ( as in eq .",
    "( [ f - delta ] ) ) .",
    "this means that weak interactions leave the result essentially unaltered , albeit lowering its spectral resolution .",
    "we next turn to the discussion of case ( b ) , @xmath291 .",
    "given that the principal setup of the theory favors low temperatures , this regime is more relevant than ( a ) .",
    "on the other hand , it also has to be kept in mind that the applicability of the theory  @xcite is limited to temperatures @xmath296 .",
    "thus , the structures discussed below apply to a temperature regime @xmath297 .",
    "in the extreme limit @xmath298  @xcite , the interactions produce a hard coulomb gap , i.e. @xmath299 . at finite temperatures",
    "the gap becomes softer but its essential features remain robust : for small bias @xmath22 , the correlation function is strongly suppressed while at large bias there are only small changes .",
    "the relevant limits are ( b1 ) @xmath300 and ( b2 ) @xmath301 .    in the first case ,",
    "when the applied voltage is small , eq .  ( [ res - int ] ) simplifies to @xmath302 i.e. , the correlator is exponentially suppressed . here",
    "@xmath303 is a factor depending algebraically on @xmath304 .    in the opposite case ,",
    "when the applied voltage is large , one obtains @xmath305 where the dominant contribution @xmath306 is the noninteracting @xmath255 smeared out over energies @xmath307 as before and @xmath308 .    summarizing , large charging energies , @xmath309 , change the noninteracting theory in two different ways .",
    "first , to avoid the coulomb blockade , large bias voltages @xmath310 have to be applied .",
    "second , even for those voltages , a lower limit @xmath311 on the maximal energetic resolution of the theory is imposed . for the reasons outlined above",
    ", we believe that , at least for sufficiently weak magnetic fields and impure samples , the effect of other interaction mechanisms is relatively minor . at any rate , since the functional dependence of the coulomb blockade corrections follows from eq .",
    "( [ res - int ] ) , the applicability of the theory can be put to test .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced an approach to exploring the three basic two - particle correlation functions of mesoscopic physics , the generalized diffuson @xmath11}$ ] , the cooperon @xmath14}$ ] , and the density - density correlator @xmath9}$ ] .",
    "the basic idea is to monitor the current flowing between two parallel 2degs as a function of three qualitatively different control parameters  a parallel magnetic field , a perpendicular field , and a bias voltage .",
    "as compared to standard transport measurement architectures , the most important advantage of the approach is that electronic correlations are detected without disturbing the ` bulk ' system through _ local _ contacts .",
    "instead the entire planar electron system acts as an ` extended contact ' whose spatial structure is , nondisturbingly , scanned by means of the two magnetic fields ; _ spectral _ electronic structures are resolved by measuring the bias voltage dependence of the current .",
    "importantly , the relevant information carried by the tunneling current is solely contained in its fluctuations . for example , we have shown that the fourier transform of the current - current correlation function with respect to the external field , directly obtains the two spatially resolved transport functions @xmath30}$ ] .",
    "in contrast , previous analyses of magnetotunneling currents , both experimentally and theoretically , focused on the average current profile that is unrelated to any ` mesoscopic ' type of information .    to exemplify the usefulness of the approach , we have considered two different applications : tunneling between two extended 2degs and tunneling from a quantum dot geometry into a 2deg . as for the former , we have shown how , at least in principle",
    ", the exponents characterizing localization / delocalization transitions can be extracted from the current data .",
    "in contrast , for a quantum dot with ergodic dynamics , the focus is on spectral rather than on spatial structures .",
    "we have explicitly worked out the connection between the tunneling current statistics and various parametric correlation functions ( a connection previously used on a semiquantitative basis to interpret the data of the experimentreported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and discussed how these correlations can be monitored by changing external field and bias voltage .",
    "as with any other tunneling setup , coulomb interactions are likely to change the outcome of the noninteracting theory . we have provided evidence in favor of the coulomb blockade being the most relevant interaction mechanism .",
    "the presence of the coulomb blockade will result in two principal effects : first , it forces one to use bias voltages in excess of the blockade threshold .",
    "second , the spectral structure of the correlation functions is washed out . this reduces the information content that can be extracted from the tunneling current statistics . the extent to which these obstructive mechanisms affect the theory is set by the coulomb charging energy . in the present system , the latter",
    "is largely determined by the inverse of the interlayer capacitance which , owing to the extended geometry of the systems , is small .",
    "thus , charging phenomena will be less pronounced than in small islands .",
    "all in all , we believe that for realistic values of the relevant system parameters , a significant parameter range over which electronic correlations can be resolved through the current approach remains .    acknowledgments : we are grateful to b.l .",
