    "the nonleptonic weak hadronic decays of the @xmath27 meson is an useful probe to test the standard model(sm ) , particularly the dynamics of it s strong interaction ( qcd ) part . due to the non - perturbative features , the amplitudes for such hadronic @xmath27-decays , are difficult to calculate directly from the qcd lagrangian . for the phenomenological study , several factorization hypotheses , like naive - factorization(nf ) , generalized factorization(gf ) and",
    "qcd factorization(qcdf ) were introduced and has been quite successful in explaining the data for exclusive @xmath27 decays , like @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 stands for pseudoscalar , vector and tensor meson ) reported by the cleo , babar and belle collaborations @xcite . out of all these hypothesis , the qcd factorization hypothesis @xcite particularly , has become very much popular in recent years because of it s successful explanation of the several @xmath27 factories data .",

    "the two innermost curves corresponds to @xmath219 and the region between this curve and the central one ( in either side ) , is allowed at the @xmath209 level .",
    "the allowed contour region followed from the br data , is rather narrow than that obtained from the @xmath163 data . within @xmath188 error bar , while @xmath3 can change widely in between @xmath220 to @xmath221 , @xmath5 changes very little : it change only by @xmath222 with respect to the central value ( corresponding to the central curve ) .",
    "note that a different @xmath174 shift the @xmath173 allowed contour region ( see figure 4 g and 4h ) . as an example , say @xmath6 , the contour plot suggest that @xmath5 should lie in between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( left region ) and in between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( right region ) for the scale @xmath25 , while for @xmath22 , it lies in between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( left region ) and @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( right region ) .    to see the explicit scale dependence of the br and cp asymmetry @xmath223 results ,",
    "let us calculate them for some chosen @xmath174 values . at @xmath12 , with @xmath19 and @xmath6 , a point well within the allowed region ,",
    "we find @xmath224 and @xmath225 when the annihilation term is taken into consideration .",
    "if the annihilation term is switched off , the correponding predictions turns out to be @xmath226 ( a change about @xmath227 ) and @xmath228 ( a change of @xmath229 ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath13 , with the same @xmath3 and @xmath5 value and considering the the annihilation contribution , we find @xmath230 and @xmath231 . without the annihilation term",
    ", we find @xmath232 ( a change about @xmath233 ) and @xmath234 ( a change of @xmath235 ) .",
    "so , the impact of power correction ( annihilation contribution ) on @xmath14 and @xmath163 at different @xmath174 is not so significant and consequently , in constraining the parameter space of @xmath5 and @xmath3 .    in figures 5(i ,",
    "j ) and 6(k ,  l ) , we have plotted @xmath163 and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath3 with different set of the renormalization scale i.e. @xmath12 ( left one ) and @xmath187 ( right one ) .",
    "note the differences arises due to the choice in renormalization scale : in figures 5(i , j ) larger negative @xmath163 may arise at @xmath13 than that due to @xmath12 and in figures 6(k , l ) , in the same way large br also arise at @xmath12 in comparison to @xmath13 .",
    "finally , from the figures 5(i ,  j ) , we see that a large negative @xmath163 , consistent with the present data , allows @xmath5 to lie around @xmath198 , for a wide range of @xmath3 , consistent with our finding .",
    "we have investgated the charmless nonleptonic @xmath0 decay within the qcd factorization framework in the standard model . two crucial things in the decay amplitudes are : ( i ) the unitarity angle @xmath3 , and ( ii ) the @xmath4 mixing angle @xmath5 , which possesses several independent constraints followed from different studies . by knowing either @xmath5 or @xmath3 from others analysis and using the hfag @xmath163 data",
    ", one can get some idea about the allowed range of @xmath3 or @xmath5 .",
    "we considered the most general scenario in which both @xmath5 and @xmath3 are being treated as the unknown parameters .",
    "we use the @xmath1 and @xmath236 ( available in the hfag webcite ) to constrain the @xmath176 contour plane . using the @xmath163 data , at the @xmath237 level",
    ", we found that when the angle @xmath5 varies in between @xmath210 to @xmath211 ( in two ranges ) , the angle @xmath3 can vary in between @xmath220 to @xmath221 .",
    "for the @xmath238 , with @xmath6 , we found that @xmath5 can vary in between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath13 , the corresponding allowed range is in between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the same choice of @xmath3 .",
    "we find the diference in the allowed contour region of @xmath5 which follows from the @xmath163 and @xmath14 constraints , a crucial finding of the present study .",
    "we made our analysis for different set of renormalization scales i.e. @xmath174 s , which results into change in the allowed region in the @xmath176 contour plane .",
    "this is an important observation of this work .",
    "the effect of power correction correction is also investigated and found to be not so significant in constraining the @xmath54 contour plane .",
    "this is so because it s ( power correction ) impact on @xmath163 and @xmath239 are about @xmath240 and @xmath233 , respectively .",
