    "it was initially expected that radio emission would not be detected in ultracool dwarf stars , given the evidence that the number of objects exhibiting magnetic activity past a spectral type of m7v was declining @xcite despite increasingly rapid rotation ; this seemed to match expectations that the cool , dense , and globally neutral atmospheres ( fractional ionizations @xmath5 10@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of ultracool dwarfs would be unable to sustain the kinds of magnetic stresses thought to operate in the atmospheres of solar - like dwarf stars ( spectral types f , g , k , and early m ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that large - scale fields can be maintained by detecting their effect on transitions in molecular absorption bands , but the fields connection to the non - radiative heating is still questionable .    since the discovery of radio emission from one of these objects @xcite , there have been two key findings : the overall number of radio - emitting ultracool dwarfs is relatively low , @xmath710% @xcite with a slight preponderance for objects of spectral type m9 to more commonly display detectable levels of radio emission @xcite ; and there is a wide variety of behavior exhibited by those objects which have shown detectable levels of radio emission .",
    "several objects have displayed pulsar - like behavior @xcite with periods consistent with those inferred from rotational periods using radius and @xmath8 measurements ; interpulse emission is observed but seems to be less circularly polarized .",
    "a few others show large increases in flux density , accompanied by large amounts of circular polarization @xcite while still others have been detected in one epoch and undetected in others @xcite .",
    "variability is at the core of these behaviors ; even the same object observed multiple times at radio wavelengths shows disparate behaviors @xcite .",
    "as with higher mass stellar radio emission @xcite it is possible that more than one type of radio emission mechanisms could be operating in the coronae of very low mass dwarfs : one , associated with gyrosynchrotron emission , is incoherent and consists of steady and variable wide - band radio emission , with moderate circular polarizations and roughly flat spectra ; the other type being a coherent mechanism , possibly cyclotron maser emission , which can be extremely variable , usually highly circularly polarized , and can have steep spectra .",
    "@xcite attributed the steady radio emission from one ultracool dwarf to gyrosynchrotron emission based on its spectral index and circular polarization behaviors .",
    "the dramatic radio variability which has been observed on a few very low mass objects generally includes highly circularly polarized emission and points to a different radio emission mechanism than usually invoked for higher mass stellar radio emission , probably coherent .",
    "current speculations are that it may be cyclotron maser emission @xcite .",
    "still unknown is how the source population of accelerated particles which produces this emission originates .",
    "although transition region and x - ray observations detect persistent fluxes from very low mass stars at levels compatible with scaling laws ( based on h@xmath9 ) extrapolated from earlier type m dwarfs , very low mass dwarfs appear to violate another tight relationship between magnetic activity indicators , namely the x - ray luminosity  radio luminosity correlation pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detection of both persistent and flaring radio emission from a handful of late m and l objects , reported in @xcite and @xcite , suggests that nonthermal radio emission is much stronger than predicted in some objects at late spectral types .",
    "the interpretation of the radio emission , however , is complicated by the fact that more than one potential mechanism may be at work : on the sun and on other active stars , both incoherent and coherent nonthermal radio emissions produce detectable levels of radio emission ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed observations of solar radio emission show that a variety of emissions can be produced in the centimeter wavelength range depending on the type and location of emitting structures and their variation with time .",
    "indeed , this provides a simple resolution to the apparent `` violation '' of the l@xmath10l@xmath11 relation in very low mass dwarfs noted by , e.g. @xcite .    studying stellar radio emission is important because it is the only wavelength region in which direct evidence of the role of accelerated electrons in stellar atmospheric structures and dynamics can routinely and easily be seen . in order to make advances in knowledge about atmospheric structure and dynamics ,",
    "temporal and spectral information is needed .",
    "detection epochs typically concentrate on building up exposure time at a single frequency with on - source times sufficient only to see very short time - scale variability such as bursting behavior .",
    "longer on - source times can probe rotationaly - induced variability as well as increase the likelihood of observing flares .",
    "simultaneous multi - frequency radio observations are better at pinning down the emission mechanism and allowing for spectral - temporal modelling to better understand the emitting structures . to this end",

    "@xcite observed the system with adaptive optics in an earlier epoch and found no evidence of multiplicity in images having spatial scales of 0.13 \" ; however @xcite found clear evidence of the binary nature of the system using adaptive optics systems .",
    "the separation of the two stars was 0.125@xmath120.01 arcseconds during the binarity discovery epoch ; @xcite measured a parallax of 67.6@xmath122.0 mas for a distance estimate of 14.8@xmath120.4 pc . based on this value , its m@xmath13 is 9.76 .",

    "recent high resolution spectroscopic observations with nirspec on the keck  ii telescope have determined a combined @xmath8 of the system to be @xmath750 km s@xmath16 ( m. rosa zapatero osorio , private communication ) . because of the small angular separation of the two stars , the spectrum obtained includes the contribution of both stars .",
    "the large @xmath8 measured thus could be due to the velocity separation of the two stars .",

    "while the limits described in @xcite for 2m0523 are much deeper , the addition of this extra epoch at which the radio emission is undetected lowers the fraction of time this object produces detectable levels of radio emission , to @xmath710% .",
    "the previously described detected emission from lhs  3003 , in @xcite , was accumulated over @xmath711 hours of integration , so the addition of this short epoch described here does not significantly affect the computed duty cycle of @xmath787% .",
    "further observations of this interesting source are required to study the transient nature of its radio emission .",
    "the detection epochs of lp349 - 25 and 2m0523 corresponded to only one wavelength ( 3.6 cm ) , and were reported in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "lhs  3003 was detected at 6 cm but not at simultaneously obtained 3.6 cm observations with the same sensitivity . while further multi - frequency observations of 2m0523 failed to detect the source at any wavelength , we have detected lp349 - 25 at both 6 and 3.6 cm on two occasions .",

    "2007 epoch data of lp349 - 25 were obtained by alternating frequencies using the full array during the same observation session , so the multi - frequency information is not strictly simultaneous . given the lack of variability on timescales @xmath36 10 seconds described in  4.1 , however , we can consider the multi - frequency recordings of lp 349 - 25 during the 15 aug .",
    "epoch to be simultaneous .    for lp349 - 25 ,",
    "the emission is stable at both frequencies in addition to being stable in time .",
    "this is revealed by the similar values returned for the radio spectral index at two epochs together with the lack of both short - term and long - term variability .",
    "the frequency difference between the 3.6 and 6 cm vla receivers is @xmath373.6 ghz , implying that the detected radio emission extends across this frequency range .",
    "in contrast , the emission from lhs  3003 reported in @xcite was detected at only one wavelength at one epoch .",
    "this implies that the emission occurs over a range in frequency @xmath383.6 ghz and possibly much smaller .",
    "unfortunately , since the multi - frequency observations of lhs  3003 we performed on 30 june 2006 did not detect the source at any frequency , we can not constrain the multi - frequency behavior of lhs  3003 during this epoch .",
    "we explored whether the contribution of both dwarfs to the radio emission from lp349 - 25 could be constrained from the observation made in a - configuration .",
    "if the two dwarfs were at the separation noted during the discovery epoch and had nearly equal intensity , we might have been able to separate the two components from our image of the a - configuration 3.6 cm data , made with 0.047 `` pixel size .",

    "deconvolving the fit from the clean beam , the nominal major and minor axes of the elliptical gaussian are 0.21  ( minimum 0.12 '' , maximum 0.28 `` ) and 0  ( minimum 0 '' , maximum 0.09 `` ) , with a position angle of 32@xmath39 ( minimum 1@xmath39 , maximum 67@xmath39 ) .",
    "minimum and maximum values are the extrema obtained by a deconvolution of the source beam from the clean beam with 0.7 times the error of component values .",
    "figure  [ fig : aarray ] shows a close - up of the radio contours .",
    "we explored using uniform or `` super - uniform '' weighting to enhance the longest baselines compared to the shortest ones , however these weighting schemes also increase the noise and these images produced peaks at lower significance value , with evidence for only one source at the location of lp349 - 25 ; there was no evidence for a second source out to the maximum distance sampled in the a - configuration image , 24 '' from lp349 - 25 .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising : the discovery epoch on july 3 , 2004 of the binarity of lp349 - 25 @xcite revealed the separation between the two stars to be 0.125@xmath120.01 \" at a position angle of 12.7@xmath122.0@xmath39 east from north , while an earlier epoch on sept .",
    "18 - 19 , 2001 @xcite showed the system to be unresolved .",
    "this earlier epoch occurred almost 6 years prior to our observations , and with the estimate by @xcite that the orbital period is about 5 years an explanation for why the two stars were not resolved is apparent .",
    "the a - configuration observations thus do not constrain whether one or both dwarfs in the lp349 - 25 system contribute to the total observed radio emission ; further observations at higher spatial resolution are needed to resolve the two dwarfs .",
    "spatially resolving the two stars in the binary system is important for two reasons .",
    "the first is that this will allow us to determine the relative amount of radio emission arising from each dwarf , and hence explore radio emission mechanisms further .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the radio luminosity from the system is slightly higher than the steady levels seen from other radio - emitting ultracool dwarfs .",
    "the second lies in the unique nature of lp349 - 25 as a nearby tight binary with an orbital period amenable to astrometric monitoring ; direct mass measurements are crucial to placing constraints on the formation processes of very low mass ( @xmath31 0.1 m@xmath18 ) stellar objects @xcite .",
    "mass determinations are also important for comparing with theoretically derived masses from evolutionary models , and establishing mass - luminosity relations in this mass range @xcite . due to the low flux density , sensitive high spatial resolution observations such as",
    "those attainable with the high sensitivity array are needed ; we have an approved program to begin this monitoring , which should be able to attain an astrometric precision of @xmath17 30 @xmath21as using phase referenced observations @xcite .",
    "lp 349 - 25 thus provides the keys to understanding the formation of ultracool dwarfs as well as the enigmatic nature of their radio emission .",
    "of our observations of three ultracool dwarfs , the detections of lp 349 - 25 offer the most stringent constraints on the types of radio emission produced in ultracool dwarfs .",
    "the relevant and interesting facts about the radio behavior seen on lp 349 - 25 are that the emission is constant on both short- and long timescales , and that the observed multi - frequency radio emission has a flat spectral index which also does not appear to vary on short and long timescales .",
    "this is unusual behavior in light of the fact that the few ultracool dwarfs which have been detected at radio wavelengths have all exhibited dramatic variability , whether periodic or bursting behavior .",
    "here we explore what constraints these details provide within the context of behavior seen on active stars and ultracool dwarfs .",
    "the lack of short - timescale variability on lp349 - 25 on timescales of 10 s or larger is constrained by the observations conducted on 12 jan .",
    "2007 , for 10.7 hours at both 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "this observation duration should have been long enough to discern periodic variability : for @xmath4010 km s@xmath16 , the rotation period for a 0.12 r@xmath18 star of mass @xmath70.09 m@xmath18 @xcite is @xmath31 10 hours ( in which case we should have seen one complete rotation period ) , and for v@xmath4120 km s@xmath16 , we should have seen two or more rotation periods .",
    "rotational modulation of the radio emission from ultracool dwarfs is a commonly observed behavior @xcite , and so its lack in the case of lp349 - 25 is significant .",
    "we note that the greatest constraints on lack of short - term variability come from our c - configuration observation spanning 10.7 hours , but the observation of lp349 - 25 described by @xcite lasted 1.7 hours .",
    "expressed as a fraction of the unknown rotation period this span @xmath42 is 1.7 hours / p ; taking the upper limit on p to be 10 hours , this observation spanned a fraction of the rotation period @xmath43 .",
    "for short periods ( 23 hours ) , this is a significant fraction of the rotation period , and the lack of variability seen during this observation provides an additional constraint on the lack of rotationally modulated for the case of short periods .",
    "the absence of variability in lp 349 - 25 on timescales comparable to the rotation period of one or both stars imposes spatial constraints .",
    "the viewing orientation could explain the lack of variability : if the inclination of the binary system is situated close to pole - on then no modulation of the radio emission is to be expected if either or both dwarfs produces radio emission .",
    "however , the preliminary measurement of a substantial @xmath8 discussed in  2.1 suggests that one or both of the dwarfs may be rapidly rotating , and for a pole - on configuration no rotational broadening of emission lines is expected .",
    "however , if the system were not observed at a nearly pole - on configuration , then the pattern of temporal emission would resemble the pulsar behavior seen in other ultracool dwarfs @xcite",
    ". there could be many emitting structures whose properties are uniform and so cause a lack of observed rotational modulation .",
    "this would require a high degree of homogeneity of the magnetic structures over the surface of one or both stars .",
    "a peculiar arrangement could be obtained between both ultracool dwarfs where both are radio - emitting but do so out of phase with each other , so that the total observed radio emission appears to be constant .",
    "this seems unlikely , as it would require rather special conditions to occur ; namely , the two dwarfs are tidally locked or information can be communicated on timescales @xmath3110 seconds .",
    "the separation of the two dwarfs at the discovery epoch was @xmath171.8 au , and this distance is too large for tidal locking to occur : the synchronization timescale given by @xcite is @xmath734 gyr .",
    "finally , a circumbinary radio - emitting structure could be present , but given the separation of the two dwarfs ( @xmath44 r@xmath45 at the discovery epoch ) this is also unlikely .    since variability is a key factor controlling the observed radio emission from other ultracool dwarfs , we explore some physical constraints imposed by the variability timescales here .",
    "timescales as short as a few minutes have been observed during impulsive bursting behavior @xcite .",
    "we explore the time evolution of the radio emission on short timescales under the constraints that no emission variability is observed .",
    "if the emission is due to singular injection events akin to the isolated bursts seen in other systems , then assuming that the emission region is localized , energy loss can occur through collisional losses in a high density environment , or radiation losses in a high magnetic field region .",
    "the timescale for this energy loss then can be related to the limits on observed variability , to provide a constraint on the plasma environment .",
    "the collisional deflection time for a particle of energy @xmath46 is + @xmath47 ( eq .",

    "4@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the constraints do not depend tightly on the choice of t. the timescale for radiation loss is + @xmath57 @xcite where @xmath58 is the magnetic field strength in gauss , @xmath59 the lorentz factor ; for a 10 kev electron , t@xmath60 is greater than 10.7 hours for @xmath61130 g or less than 10 s for @xmath62 g . although we can not rule out that variability is occurring on timescales less than 10 seconds , the extreme plasma conditions ( @xmath53 3@xmath54 @xmath3 or @xmath62 g ) make the scenario of rapid variability on these timescales implausible .",

    "the changes in the radio emission properties in the case of both active stars and ultracool dwarfs can be linked to the finite lifetime of the starspots or magnetic structures which are presumed to give rise to the radio emission .",
    "starspots on active stars have lifetimes which depend on their latitude : long - lived spots lying at high latitudes can survive for years @xcite but starspots at lower latitudes have lifetimes of less than about a month @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed that starspot lifetime on active stars was longer for larger spots .",
    "these trends are due to the competing effects on magnetic flux transport of differential rotation , convection , and meridional flows .",
    "the changes in the optical properties of the ultracool dwarf tvlm513 - 46456 are characterized in one epoch by rotational modulation of isolated starspots @xcite and in another by rotation of persistent dust clouds @xcite , confirming the finite lifetime of magnetic structures in ultracool dwarfs as well .",
    "so the stability of the radio - emitting source in lp 349 - 25 over similar timescales as those during which the radio emission from tvlm513 - 46546 was observed to change dramatically is unique .",
    "this remarkable stability is consistent with similar conditions being the three ( two ) epochs when 3.6 cm ( 6 cm ) observations were obtained , over timescales of more than a year .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic structure giving rise to the radio emission for lp 349 - 25 lies predominantly at high latitudes , if the same magnetic structure is giving rise to the radio emission in all three epochs .",
    "it also suggests that the lifetimes of the magnetic structures are long - lived , or alternatively that there is little variation in the properties of the magnetic structures which form .",
    "the spectral index measurements of lp 349 - 25 during the c- and a - configuration epochs described in section 4.2 are the same to within 2 @xmath30 , and consistent to 2 @xmath30 with a value of 0 .",
    "for these purposes we consider this `` flat '' even though with the same statistical significance the two spectral index measurements are compatible with the range @xmath65 .",
    "section 4.2 also described the lack of evidence for changes in the spectral index within the c - configuration observations on timescales greater than 10 seconds .",
    "a primary constraint on the radio emission mechanism from the spectral index is that it does not change significantly . at the most basic level",
    ", this indicates that there were no observed changes in optical depth on timescales either within the c - configuration observations ( @xmath50 10 seconds ) , or on longer timescales between the two epochs in which both 3.6 and 6 cm observations were obtained ( 0.6 years ) .    optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung naturally produces a flat spectral index @xcite . in this case , the optical depth is expressed as @xmath660.2 @xmath67 , where @xmath49 is the temperature of the thermal plasma , @xmath68 is the characteristic length scale along the line of sight , and @xmath48 and @xmath69 are the electron density and observing frequency , respectively .",
    "the brightness temperature t@xmath70=t@xmath71 for @xmath721 , and the the flux density s@xmath73 is + @xmath74 where k@xmath75 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath76 the speed of light , and @xmath77 the differential solid angle . writing @xmath77 as @xmath78 with @xmath79 the source area and @xmath80 the distance to the target",
    ", we can express the flux density as a function of the observed temperature and volume emission measure ( @xmath81 ) , + @xmath82 where the volume emission measure has units of @xmath3 and temperature is in units of k. thermal bremsstrahlung emission from a chromosphere or corona at temperatures from 10@xmath83  10@xmath51k imply volume emission measures around 10@xmath84 @xmath3 for the observed levels of radio flux density .",
    "as described in @xcite , the distribution of spectral indices for a sample of active k and m dwarfs taken from @xcite has an average of @xmath85 and fwhm of 1.5 .",
    "the behavior of lp349 - 25 is consistent with this spread .",
    "the interpretation for active stars is that the emission arises from an inhomogeneous source emitting optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission . in the optically thin limit , for a value",
    "@xmath86 parameterizing the number density distribution of accelerated electron energies ( @xmath87 ) , the flux density depends on frequency as s@xmath88 , so a flat spectrum could be obtained if the spectrum of nonthermal electrons is particularly hard , @xmath89 .    another possibility to explain a flat spectral index is a hybrid of the above two models , optically thick gyrosynchrotron emission with opacity provided by collisions .",
    "this model obtains a flat spectral index for a value @xmath86 of 3.6 . for this model",
    ", a large electron density is required for the collisional opacity to exceed the gyrosynchrotron opacity . for the conditions described in  5.1 , namely t@xmath710@xmath51k and b@xmath90130 g",
    ", @xmath48 must be @xmath91 10@xmath92 @xmath3 for values of the total nonthermal electron density @xmath50 1 .",
    "this is at odds with the restrictions in  5.1 necessitating a low electron density ( @xmath9310@xmath2 @xmath3 ) for the plasma cooling time to be long enough that no variability would have been seen .",
    "the discussion in the above three sections describes temporal and spectral index constraints on the radio emission from lp 349 - 25 .",
    "here we examine these constraints , together with the upper limits on circular polarization and possible values of brightness temperature , for what they can tell us about the radio emission from this ultracool dwarf binary .",
    "the simplest explanation which fits the lack of variability and flat spectral index observed on lp 349 - 25 is that the emission arises from optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung radiation distributed uniformly across one or both of the stellar disks .",
    "however , this model runs into several problems .",
    "if we assume that this material is distributed homogeneously across the disk of one star , with length scale equal to r@xmath45 or smaller , then electron densities in excess of 2.2@xmath110@xmath94 @xmath3 are required to produce the volume emission measure determined in  5.3 .",
    "the plasma frequency corresponding to such a density n@xmath95 would be @xmath96 4.2 ( n@xmath95/2.2@xmath110@xmath94 ) ghz , with n@xmath95 in @xmath3 , and we would expect a cutoff at or below the 6 cm observing frequency .",
    "optically thin radio bremsstrahlung emission would also show up at longer wavelengths as x - ray emission , and given the distance of lp349 - 25 , implies an x - ray flux from 0.22.4 kev of @xmath74@xmath110@xmath97 erg @xmath98 , or l@xmath10 of 10@xmath99 erg s@xmath16 .",
    "this would put lp349 - 25 in the top 101 brightest x - ray stars within 50 pc @xcite and would make the lack of a detection in the rosat all - sky survey , which had sensitivities well below this flux value ( down to 10@xmath100 erg @xmath98 s@xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) problematic .",
    "it would equally well represent a discontinuity with the x - ray behavior of other ultracool dwarfs , which have @xmath101 typically around 10@xmath102 erg s@xmath16 @xcite when they are detected . the emission from radio - active stars and ultracool dwarfs by extension",
    "is usually associated with the presence of enhanced magnetic fields , which naturally leads to gyrosynchrotron or synchrotron emission for incoherent radiation , or cyclotron maser emission for coherent radiation .",
    "these mechanisms require accelerated particles , and so the constraints on the plasma environment deduced in  4.1 from the lack of aperiodic short - term variability are applicable here .",
    "the general gyrosynchrotron model as applied to active stars would require a spatially inhomogeneous source to arrive at the flat spectral index .",
    "however , the lack of short - term variability described in  4.1 require that the same emitting region be visible over the one or more rotation periods seen in the c - configuration data . based on expected lifetimes of starspots seen in active stars and the evidence for epoch - to - epoch changes of radio emission in another well - studied ultracool dwarf , a long - lived polar spot and the binary having",
    "a high orbital / rotationl inclination are plausible .",
    "this would naturally explain both the lack of short - term and long - term variability , as the high inclination would lead to no rotational modulation over the short term , and the similar values of flux density and spectral index are consistent with the same emitting structure producing the observed radio emission .",
    "a highly homogeneous source with a hard distribution of electrons would also produce a flat spectral index , as discussed in  5.3 .",
    "either of these explanations requires that there is little long - term evolution of magnetic structures responsible for producing the radio emission , which is unique amongst active stars .",
    "it is also at odds with the preliminary evidence that one or more of the stars produces a large @xmath8 signature discussed in  2.1 .",
    "gyrosynchtron emission usually arises at frequencies corresponding to harmonic numbers @xmath103 between 10 and 100 of the electron gyrofrequency , given by @xmath104 , with @xmath10510@xmath106 , @xmath58 being the magnetic field in the radio - emitting source in gauss and @xmath107 in hz .",
    "the ranges of magnetic field strengths derived from the two observing frequencies is 17@xmath108170 g for 6 cm emission , and 30@xmath108300 g for 3.6 cm , which is compatible with the magnetic field strength derived in  4.1 to explain the lack of short - term variability . a hybrid collisional / gyrosynchrotron model , although producing a flat spectral index , is difficult to reconcile based on the high electron density required for collisional opacity to exceed gyrosynchrotron opacity .",
    "the inferred brightness temperatures , as discussed in @xcite , are not constraining , due to uncertainties in the source size .",
    "research on solar bursts indicates that gyrosynchrotron radiation can be directive @xcite , although the requirements for lack of periodic variability in this case require that the source be located at high latitudes , with a high inclination , and either isotropic or beamed emission can be accomodated .    a coherent mechanism like electron - cyclotron maser could also be operating to produce the radio emission from lp 349 - 25 .",
    "while the intense bursts observed from several ultracool dwarfs have been interpreted using this framework , this is also problematic within the context of the observations and constraints described here .",
    "the observed emission shows no net polarization , which could be explained if the emission is intrinsically polarized but becomes depolarized due to propagation and scattering effects .",
    "@xcite noted that the average emission from tvlm513 - 46546 was flat , but these measurements were not obtained simultaneously and includes periodic emission , and so it is not clear if the flat spectral index measured from tvlm513 - 46546 has any bearing on the observed flat spectral index for lp349 - 25 in the absence of any variability .",
    "cyclotron maser emission at the fundamental or second harmonic is emitted at frequencies @xmath104 where @xmath103 is 1 or 2 respectively .",
    "a maser operating at the observing frequencies of 4.8 ( 8.4 ) ghz requires a magnetic field in the emitting region of 1.7 ( 3 ) kg for fundamental emission at 6 ( 3.6 ) cm , and 0.86 ( 1.5 ) kg for second harmonic emission at the same respective frequencies .",
    "given the constraints on magnetic field strength from lack of variability on short and long timescales from  5.1 , namely that b@xmath31 130 g or b@xmath5010@xmath83 g , in neither case would a maser would be observable at 3.6 or 6 cm .",
    "plasma conditions must also be favorable for a cyclotron maser to operate , the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency , @xmath109/@xmath107 , being less than one . for fundamental or harmonic emission , with the constraints on @xmath110 and",
    "@xmath58 from  4.1 , this ratio is @xmath70.01 , and so is met .",
    "there is no general context to explain a particular value of spectral index under electron cyclotron maser emission .",
    "broad - band coherent emission as suggested by @xcite requires that the radiation be emitted at multiple points in the stellar atmosphere , or arise from relativistic electrons @xmath111 .",
    "we can dismiss the latter case because this implies @xmath1122 , or electrons with kinetic energy @xmath50511 kev , which would be much more energetic than have ever been detected from active stars ; even discussions of the electron cyclotron maser on the sun consider particle energies of a few tens of kev @xcite .",
    "in addition , in order for electrons of this energy to retain their energy for timescales longer than 10.7 hours requires plasma environments of @xmath11310@xmath51 @xmath3 and b@xmath3190 g to survive against collisional losses and radiative losses , respectively .",
    "this is incompatible with the requirement to have the magnetic field in the emitting region be between 0.863 kg based on identification of the observing frequency with the fundamental or harmonic of the electron gyrofrequency .",
    "it is always possible that the maser is continuously resupplied with relativistic particles but this requires that particle acceleration be steady over the long timescales constrained here ( 1.6 year ) , and suggests an even lower magnetic field strength in the source if the particles are to survive against radiative losses .",
    "this may necessitate a resupply of relativistic electrons over these long timescales with no change in intensity or spectral index .",
    "astrophysical sources of particle acceleration are by and large associated with variability , either radio or x - ray synchrotron variability , and indicate stochastic acceleration . under these conditions ,",
    "we find the cyclotrom maser interpretation of this steady radio emission from lp 349 - 25 to be problematic , and in light of this we conclude that an incoherent mechanism is most compatible with the observational constraints .    in summary ,",
    "the variability constraints argue for a high latitude source with a high rotational / orbital inclination in order not to observe any rotationally - induced intensity changes .",
    "this same source should survive for at least 0.6 yr to explain the similar values of @xmath9 in two epochs , and requires that there is little evolution of the magnetic configuration that gives rise to the radio emission .",
    "gyrosynchrotron emission from a spatially inhomogeneous or homogeneous source can explain the flat spectral index .",
    "the plasma environment must consist of low densities ( n@xmath1144@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 ) and moderate magnetic field strengths ( @xmath115 g ) in order that the high energy electrons not lose energy by collisions or radiation on timescales comparable to those imposed by our c - configuration observations .",
    "in contrast , problems are encountered with a cyclotron maser mechanism explanation in key aspects of the observations . within the context provided by the lifetimes of starspots , and with the expectation that the radio emission arises from a region of enhanced magnetic fields ,",
    "the constraints imply that a stable polar spot emitting gyrosynchrotron emission may be the origin of the steady radio emission from lp 349 - 25 .",
    "further monitoring of lp 349 - 25 to determine whether it is variable may help answer other questions about radio emission from ultracool dwarfs , namely the nature of the unpolarized `` steady '' radio emission observed outside of highly polarized bursts on other ultracool dwarfs .",
    "note that the overall detection rates of radio emission for ultracool dwarfs , @xmath710% , are not that different from the optical flare duty cycles of 57% @xcite and the implied radio duty cycles of @xmath710% for the transiently emitting object 2m0523 .",
    "there may be a significant bias in the the number of objects which produce detectable levels of radio emission if variability affects the detection rates ; potentially more ultracool dwarfs may be capable of producing detectable but transient levels of radio emission than are currently assessed by single epoch surveys .",
    "this highlights the need for multiple epoch observations of radio - detected ultracool objects , and probably further monitoring of objects previously undetected in earlier epochs .",
    "the recent detection of several unidentified submillijansky radio transients @xcite suggests that there may be a large reservoir of low mass or ultracool stellar objects at distances of @xmath17 1 kpc producing transient radio emission which can contribute to the rate of radio transients . further characterizing",
    "the behavior of nearby low mass and ultracool dwarfs is therefore necessary to be disentangle a stellar component from this unknown source population .",
    "our investigation of the radio emission from three ultracool dwarfs yields useful constraints from only one .",
    "the temporal and multi - frequency radio observations of lp 349 - 25 suggest that the radio emitting structures are located at a high latitude on one of the stars , and that the rotational and orbital axes have a high inclination with respect to our line of sight , in order to explain the lack of variation associated with orbital or rotational modulation .",
    "this is potentially at odds with the preliminary determination of the @xmath8 of the system .",
    "the absence of transient or aperiodic variability over short timescales also constrains the plasma conditions which must be present , in order that high energy particles not lose their energy through collisions or radiative losses .",
    "the similar flux density values and spectral indices returned from epochs 0.6 years apart are consistent with a long - lived magnetic structure giving rise to the emission .",
    "we explore the implications for the radio - emitting mechanism , and rule out a thermal source .",
    "gyrosynchrotron emission from an inhomogeneous or homogeneous source can explain the flat spectral index and is compatible with the limits imposed on the plasma environment from short - timescale constraints .",
    "an electron - cyclotron maser is not compatible with the plasma constraints . in terms of its observational properties and the implications",
    "provided thereby for the radio emission mechanism , lp 349 - 25 is unique amongst ultracool dwarfs in exhibiting an incoherent mechanism , and suggests that the mixed behavior of active stars at radio wavelengths , exhibiting one or both of gyrosynchrotron and a coherent emission mechanism , can survive to the substellar boundary .",
    "temporal constraints on long timescales imply that there is little long - term evolution of magnetic structures , an important result for the magnetic fields only recently established to be present in ultracool dwarfs .",
    "further monitoring will confirm whether lp349 - 25 is truly unique in its steady multi - frequency emissions , and interferometric observations at higher angular resolution are needed to determine whether one or both dwarfs contributes to the total radio emission .",
    "both steady and transient radio emission have been presented in this paper , and our conclusions support continued monitoring of all radio - detected ultracool dwarfs in order to elucidate further the nature of radio emission near the substellar boundary .",
