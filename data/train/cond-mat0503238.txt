    "in @xcite the evolution equation for the nucleation period has been derived . here",
    "we shall analyze the properties of the evolution equation and the uniqueness and existence of the solution of special problems appeared in the theory of nucleation .",
    "consider the initial problem formulated in @xcite    * *    * the following equation is given @xmath0 with positive parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which are chosen to satisfy condition @xmath5    equation ( [ i ] ) and condition ( [ ii ] ) form the initial problem .",
    "this problem as well as all other ones is considered in a class of continuous functions .    instead of the function @xmath6",
    "we introduce the function @xmath7 .",
    "then we get @xmath8 @xmath9    we change the variables @xmath10 @xmath11    the new variables will be marked by the same letters @xmath12 .",
    "then we get @xmath13 @xmath14    we denote @xmath15 also as @xmath4 .",
    "the value @xmath16 will be denoted as @xmath6 .",
    "we come to the following problem    * *    * the following equation @xmath17 is given with the positive parameter @xmath4 , chosen to satisfy @xmath18    the equation ( [ p ] ) and the condition ( [ pp ] ) form the reduced problem .",
    "so , here only one parameter @xmath4 remains .",
    "it is more convenient to consider instead of @xmath6 the function @xmath19 then we come to the following problem ( problem a )    * *    * the following equation @xmath20 is given with the positive parameter @xmath4 , chosen to satisfy @xmath21    equation ( [ 1 ] ) and the condition ( [ 1l ] ) form the problem a. this problem will be the auxiliary problem .",
    "consider now the problem b    * *    * the following equation @xmath22 is given    only the equation ( [ g ] ) forms the problem b.    we see that the problem b has no parameters .",
    "the main goal of investigation will be to see the uniqueness of the solution of the problem b.",
    "at first we consider ( [ 1 ] ) with some positive @xmath4 .",
    "we rewrite ( [ 1 ] ) for function @xmath6 in the form @xmath23    one can see the following property    * if the solution exists , then @xmath24 for any @xmath25 *    this property goes from the positivity of sub - integral function .",
    "we introduce the iterated equation @xmath26    we also introduce the nonlinear operator @xmath27 according to @xmath28    one can prove the following fact :    * if for any @xmath29 the following inequality @xmath30 takes place , then @xmath31 takes place for any @xmath29 . *    it follows from the explicit form of @xmath27 .",
    "one can also see the following fact    * if the solution exists then @xmath32 for any @xmath25 *    it follows from the positivity of exponent in the sub - integral function .",
    "we construct iterations according to @xmath33 as the initial approximation we choose @xmath34    * we see that @xmath35 for any value of the argument *    it follows from the positivity of exponent and the whole sub - integral function .",
    "form the statements formulated above it follows the following chain of inequalities @xmath36 for any value of the argument .",
    "so , the odd iterations converge and the even iterations converge .",
    "so , the solution of the iterated equation exists .",
    "but the uniqueness is nt yet proven .    for",
    "any initial approximation which is always positive the iterations with initial @xmath37 estimate them from above .    since the r.h.s .",
    "is positive and solution has to be positive , the iterations with any initial approximation have to be positive starting from some number ( the asymptotics at small arguments are written explicitly ) .",
    "correspondingly , later the iterations will be estimated by the already constructed iterations .",
    "so , the convergence can be estimated to convergence of constructed iterations .",
    "remark : the analogous iterations have been constructed by f.m.kuni in 1984 , but for the problem b. for the problem b the monotonic functions are absent and it is impossible to prove in such a simple way the convergence of iterations @xmath38 with @xmath39      now we shall prove the existence and uniqueness of non - iterated equation([1 ] ) ( in the class of continuous functions )    it can be done by several ways .",
    "one of the methods is to introduce the cut - off from the side of small @xmath25 , i.e. to consider only @xmath40 with big and positive parameter @xmath41 .",
    "it was done in @xcite . here",
    "we shall use more rigorous method .",
    "we shall show that for given @xmath4 at @xmath42\\ ] ] with some small positive fixed @xmath43 the solution of ( [ 1 ] ) exists and it is unique .",
    "we construct iterations @xmath44 .",
    "the starting approximation is not important .",
    "we note that they do not go out of the class of positive continuous functions . under the arbitrary initial approximation",
    ", all iterations starting from the first one will be positive .",
    "we have for approximations @xmath45    then @xmath46 in the functional space @xmath47 $ ] @xmath48 and positive @xmath49 the following inequality @xmath50 takes place .",

    "then this sequence is the caushi sequence , then it converges , then the limit of iterations exists and it is the solution of equation ( [ 1 ] ) with given @xmath4 . since the iterations from the first one are positive , then the convergence takes place namely to this limit and the solution is the unique one .    the proof of existence and the uniqueness of solution ( [ 1 ] ) with given @xmath4 in the region @xmath56",
    "is completed .",
    "now we shall consider solution at @xmath57 .",
    "at first it will be difficult to consider all @xmath25 , and we shall consider only those arguments , which correspond to the formation of essential part of the droplets . we shall determine them more accurately .    remark : we consider here a set of iterations .",
    "but this construction has no connection with a real rate of convergence of iterations with a fixed initial approximation . to estimate the real rate of convergence it is more correct to consider at first two different solutions , then to construct the iterations based on these solutions and to prove that they will come to one limit . here",
    "the iterations are constructed correctly , but later the difficulty appears .",
    "the difficulty is that one can not use in constructions for calculations the limit of previous iterations as the base for the next type of iterations .",
    "one has to make a more detailed analysis including the establishing of the smoothness of the influence of the difference of the real iteration and the limit on the evolution at the further sub - period .",
    "it can be done but it is connected with some long formulas .",
    "so , we use the iterations , but keep in mind that we have to consider simply two different solutions . at the further sub - periods since the uniqueness at previous sub - period has been established one can choose the different solution with the common part at the previous sub - period .",
    "at first we shall present some properties of solution .",
    "one can notice that    * the precise solution @xmath6 increases if @xmath25 increases * any iteration @xmath59 increases if @xmath25 increases    this follows from the explicit expressions .",
    "the mentioned properties allow to show some properties for the function @xmath60 and iterations @xmath61    * function @xmath58 has only one maximum * function @xmath62 for every @xmath63 has only one maximum * function @xmath58 is always positive * function @xmath62 for every @xmath63 is always positive * the maximum of @xmath58 is greater than the maximum of @xmath64 * the maximum of @xmath58 is less than the maximum of @xmath65    beside this one can show that if @xmath58 really exists , then all possible solutions lie between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we shall prove that @xmath65 at big @xmath29 has to decrease until zero .",
    "it can be seen from the following estimate .",
    "certainly , @xmath66 for positive @xmath25 is less than function @xmath67 the last function has the evident asymptote @xmath68 which can be calculated exactly with some positive @xmath69 or @xmath70\\ ] ]    so , we see that @xmath65 goes to zero rather fast and for given small positive fixed value of @xmath65 ( let it be @xmath71 ) one can see the boundary @xmath72 where @xmath65 will be smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "this completes the proof .    since one can prove that solutions @xmath73 of iterated equation lie below @xmath65 the same conclusions take place for the iterated equation",
    "now we shall prove that for @xmath74 the solution exists and it is the unique one .",
    "here we construct the iterations of the special type @xmath75 ( marked by the subscript @xmath76 where it is important ) as the following ones :    * before @xmath56 the initial approximation @xmath77 is the precise solution ( we already proved that it is unique ) . * at @xmath57 we take @xmath78 * the recurrent procedure remains the previous one .",

    "of the last relation leads to @xmath106 .",

    "then it must have a limit .",
    "this limit will be the unique one and it is the unique precise solution of equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the uniqueness in the global sense can be proven by approach used in investigation of the iterated solution .",
    "it has to be repeated every time we come to analogous situation .",
    "the existence and the uniqueness of solution of equation ( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath107 are proven .    generally speaking",
    "this proof is sufficient for uniqueness at every finite @xmath25 but here we have estimated @xmath108 by @xmath109 .",
    "it is possible to give more precise estimate , which will be done below .",
    "now we shall prove the existence and uniqueness for the rest @xmath25 .",
    "we construct iterations of the special type @xmath110 . the procedure is absolutely analogous to the special type @xmath75 but",
    "now the iterations are the precise solution until @xmath72 .",
    "all properties mentioned for the special type @xmath75 remain here .",
    "now we rewrite equation for @xmath111 and have @xmath112 dx\\ ] ] here @xmath113 is the power @xmath114 .",
    "now we keep parameter @xmath113 because in further investigations @xcite it will be necessary to prove all for the arbitrary positive ( and not integer ) power .    for the integer power",
    "the task is more simple because having differentiated several times we can kill the integral term and reduce the equation to the differential equation .",
    "then we can use all standard theorems for differential equations .    then @xmath115 @xmath116",
    "one can write @xmath117 with some fixed @xmath118 then @xmath119 one can see that @xmath120    having applied this estimate @xmath63 times with explicit integration one can come to the following estimate @xmath121 with some constant and two functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "of the previous relation is the term in taylor s serial for the function @xmath131 + 1})\\ ] ]    so , it is the caushy sequence .",
    "so , the initial sequence is also the caushy sequence .",
    "so , it converges and converges to the unique solution .",
    "so , the existence and the uniqueness of solution in the region @xmath132 is proven .",
    "one has also to note that in consideration of the second region there was absolutely no difference to prove the property until @xmath72 or until @xmath133 .",
    "so , in the rest region @xmath134 the existence and the uniqueness also take place .",
    "now we shall give some estimates for position of maximum of @xmath58 at small and big values of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the point ( for given @xmath4 there will only one point ) of the maximum of precise @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath83 be the maximum of @xmath62 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath135 then the value @xmath136 can be found from the maximum of @xmath137 and satisfies the equation @xmath138 then @xmath139 for every positive @xmath4 it exists .",
    "the value of @xmath64 at the maximum is @xmath140 and @xmath141    the last value goes to infinity when @xmath4 goes to infinity .",
    "one can see that according to @xmath142 the following inequality @xmath143 takes place .",
    "one can easily calculate @xmath144 : @xmath145    from @xmath146 it follows that @xmath147    at @xmath148 we see that @xmath149    so , at @xmath148 we see that @xmath150 .    since at every @xmath4 the solution exists ,",
    "since it is unique and since has one maximum then one can say that the dependence @xmath84 on @xmath4 can be treated as a function . at @xmath148",
    "it is positive .",
    "now we shall consider small positive @xmath4 .",
    "we do nt mention every time that @xmath4 is positive but all conclusions for arbitrary @xmath4 mean for arbitrary positive @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath151 one can see that @xmath152 so , now we calculate @xmath153 .",
    "it is the root of equation @xmath154    we introduce @xmath155 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "we see that @xmath156 is a growing function of @xmath25 .",
    "the last equation can be rewritten as @xmath157 if we change @xmath156 by some @xmath158 which is less than @xmath156 then the root @xmath159 of equation @xmath160 will be greater than @xmath153 @xmath161 and , thus , @xmath162    to construct @xmath158 we notice that @xmath163 since @xmath164 for all @xmath29",
    ".    then @xmath165 @xmath166 dx = i_2^*\\ ] ]    now we shall calculate the root of @xmath167 . having calculated integrals",
    "we come to @xmath168    having marked @xmath169 as @xmath170 we come to the square algebraic equation @xmath171    one can see that for small positive @xmath4 there are two roots : one is very close to zero , another is greater than the first one but also it is rather close to zero .",
    "so , @xmath172 then @xmath173 and @xmath174 goes to @xmath175 .",
    "it means that @xmath176 goes also to @xmath175 .",
    "since the roots to equation considered above are continuous functions of parameters ( at positive @xmath4 ) we see that there exists some fixed small @xmath177 at which @xmath159 is negative .",
    "then at @xmath177 the value @xmath84 is also negative .",
    "if we now prove that the function @xmath178 is a continuous function then according to bolzano - caushi theorem there will be a root @xmath179 .",
    "now we shall prove that the solution of equation ( [ 1 ] ) depends on @xmath4 continuously for @xmath180 .",
    "then it will follow that the maximum of @xmath181 will be continuous function and @xmath84 is continuous function of @xmath4 .",
    "imagine that @xmath6 corresponds to @xmath4 and @xmath182 corresponds to @xmath183",
    ". then @xmath184 dx\\ ] ]    we see that the function @xmath185 at every @xmath29 can be interpreted as a function of two arguments @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "we see that the dependence on both arguments is the exponential one",
    ". since the second derivative of exponent is always positive , one can give the estimate from above for @xmath186 .",
    "namely , @xmath187 marks the maximal absolute values of derivatives which are attained on one of the ends of intervals @xmath188 $ ] and @xmath189 $ ] correspondingly .    having calculated derivatives",
    "we come to latexmath:[\\[|q(c , g ) - q(c`,g`)| < \\exp(c^ * x ) \\exp(-g^*(x ) ) |x|    \\exp(c^ { * * } x ) \\exp(-g^ { * * } ( x ) )    values of @xmath4 used in the maximal values of derivatives ; @xmath191 and @xmath192 are some values of @xmath6 used in the maximal values of derivatives .",
    "we do nt require that @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "then @xmath195 and @xmath196 one can come to @xmath197 we have @xmath198 @xmath199    the function @xmath200 is the growing function of @xmath25 .",
    "we see that @xmath201 .",
    "the condition @xmath202 with a fixed small positive @xmath203 determines the boundary @xmath204 . then for @xmath205 we see that @xmath206 with some fixed @xmath207 .",
    "so , @xmath6 depends on @xmath4 continuously at @xmath205 .",
    "one can also prove that @xmath208 depend on @xmath4 continuously .",
    "it can be done quite analogously .",
    "certainly , the value of @xmath204 can be changed but remains the finite one .",
    "now we shall investigate @xmath209 .",
    "one can present @xmath210 in the following form @xmath211 @xmath212    it is clear that @xmath213 is the polynomial of the third order on @xmath25 with coefficients proportional to @xmath214 . since coefficients are continuous functions of @xmath4 one can state that the whole polynomial is the continuous function of @xmath4 .",
    "so , one can write @xmath215 with some constant @xmath216 .    then for @xmath217 one can see that @xmath218 @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , @xmath222 one can come to @xmath223 one can come to @xmath224 @xmath225",
    "can be easy calculated analytically .",
    "when we shall write the estimate for the norm in @xmath226 .",
    "we simply have to write the norm @xmath227 instead of the absolute value @xmath228 and then we can move @xmath229 out of integral    then @xmath230 where @xmath231 can be taken and latexmath:[\\[t`_{22 } = ( z - z_{in*})^4 \\exp(c^ { * * } z )     both @xmath213 and @xmath233 have the form @xmath234 which is necessary and only @xmath235 is expressed through @xmath236 .",
    "so , to have the convergence after the recurrent use of the last formula one has to require @xmath237 with a small fixed positive @xmath238 .",
    "this completes the procedure .",
    "we can fulfill this step again and again and @xmath25 will grow .    for any arbitrary",
    "fixed @xmath239 we see that @xmath240 and we have @xmath241 so , the size of the step at elementary procedure will be @xmath242 since @xmath243 is finite , one can attain @xmath72 by the final number of steps .",
    "as the result the continuous character of dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath4 is proven .      since the spectrum @xmath245 has only one maximum , the continuous character of dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath4 is proven .    since @xmath246 and @xmath247",
    ", the continuous function @xmath244 must have a root .",
    "this root is a solution of the problem a. thus , the existence of solution of the problem a is proven .",
    "but the uniqueness is nt proven . to do this",
    "we simply calculate @xmath84 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "this dependence is drawn in the figure 1 .",
    "coordinate @xmath248 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "one can see that the root is the unique one .",
    "the analytical proof can be found below but it requires another representation .",
    "one can see that for @xmath249 the dependence @xmath244 is a growing function .",
    "but for @xmath250 already the first iteration for spectrum has positive maximum . since the maximum of precise solution can not be lower than the maximum of precise solution .",
    "the maximum of precise solution has to be positive .",
    "but the precise solution can not lie higher than @xmath251 .",
    "so , it must have maximum at positive @xmath29 .",
    "it means that the slow decrease of @xmath244 which is seen in the figure , can not lead to the negative @xmath84 .",
    "so , the solution of the problem a is also the unique one .",
    "for further purposes it will be necessary to investigate the iterated equation and to show the properties of solution .",
    "the iterated equation will be written in the following form @xmath252    one can see the following property     * the solution of ( [ it ] ) is so , that the spectrum , i.e. the function @xmath253 has only one maximum . *    really , @xmath254 is the integral with the positive sub - integral function .",
    "the function @xmath255 can be presented as @xmath256 it is also the integral with the positive sub - integral function .",
    "then the function @xmath255 is also positive .",
    "now we recall functions @xmath34",
    "@xmath257 @xmath258 they are simply the already constructed iterations for eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "one can easily see that every solution of ( [ it ] ) has to satisfy @xmath259    the proof is simply the comparison between expressions for @xmath260 , @xmath261 and the iterated equation .      here one has to fulfill two procedures :    1 .   to construct iterations to see the existence of solution 2 .   to construct estimates for different solutions to see the uniqueness    these procedures have similar technical realization .",
    "this is the reason why here we restrict the consideration only by the second case .",
    "the first case is identical in ideology to the procedure used for original ( not iterated ) equation .",
    "there we solved only the first problem .",
    "the second case for the original ( non iterated ) solution can be solved as it is described here .",
    "actually the existence for the iterated solution is already proven as the limit of increasing sequence ( odd iterations ) restricted from above and the limit of decreasing sequence ( even iterations ) restricted from below .",
    "the proof is the following :    suppose that @xmath254 and @xmath262 are two different solutions of equation ( [ it ] ) .",

    "we have @xmath294 and then @xmath295    we can apply this recurrent procedure several times and come to @xmath296 so , we see that @xmath293 can be estimated by some positive members of geometric progression .",
    "so , it means that this sequence converges and the limit is the real unique solution .",
    "the difference between @xmath267 and @xmath268 can be made negligibly small .",
    "so , we conclude that @xmath254 and @xmath262 is actually one solution .",
    "the uniqueness is proven .",
    "the existence can be proven by construction of caushi sequence .",
    "we need some estimates for @xmath297 .",
    "having constructed @xmath298 @xmath299 we see that @xmath300 @xmath301    then it follows that @xmath302 @xmath303 @xmath304 @xmath305 and we have the estimates for the maximum .",
