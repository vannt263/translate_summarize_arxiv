    "dense packings of hard spheres are an important starting point for the study of simple liquids , metallic glasses , colloids , biological systems , and granular matter @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the densest possible packing that still possesses random structure , `` random close packing '' ( rcp ) , which is important for physics and engineering .",
    "for example , the viscosity of dense particle suspensions diverges when the particles approach the rcp state @xcite . in a classic experiment , bernal and mason",
    "obtained the volume fraction of rcp @xmath1 .",
    "they compressed and shook a rubber balloon which was full of metal ball bearings for a sufficiently long time to achieve maximum density @xcite .",
    "scott and kilgour also reported @xmath2 by pouring balls into a large vibrating container @xcite .",
    "their results were sensitive to the experimental method , for example both the frequency and amplitude of vibration .",
    "likewise in computer simulations , the value of @xmath3 depends on the protocol .",
    "@xmath3 is between 0.642 and 0.648 with a rate dependent densification algorithm @xcite , 0.68 with a monte carlo methods @xcite and 0.644 with lubachevsky - stillinger packing algorithm @xcite .",
    "all of these results are for monodisperse spheres , in other words , spheres with identical diameters .",
    "the variety of results for @xmath3 , in addition to being due to the method of preparing the rcp state , perhaps also comes from the poor definition of rcp @xcite . the phrase",
    " random close packing \" is composed of two terms ,  random \" and  close packing , \" which are inherently in conflict with each other .",
    "an ideal _ random _ state would have no correlation between particles , but the constraint that particles can not overlap already diminishes the randomness of a physical packing .",
    "furthermore , to get a _",
    "close packing _",
    "the most efficient method is to pack particles into a crystalline array , which is highly non - random @xcite .",
    "for example , a random arrangement of spheres can be made denser if it partially includes dense crystalline regions , but then it is less random @xcite . in 2000",
    "torquato and coworkers proposed ",
    "maximum randomly jammed ( mrj ) \" state as a more tight definition of rcp .",
    "mrj states are defined as the least locally ordered structures which are also jammed so that no particles can move @xcite .",
    "a strictly jammed state should be incompressible and unshearable @xcite , while other definitions of jammed states can involve external forces @xcite or experimental time scales @xcite ; the latter can involve questions of glassiness . returning to strictly jammed states , one method of quantifying jamming",
    "is by considering the isothermal compressibility @xmath4 , which is determined by the structure factor at wave number @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are density of the material , pressure , boltzmann constant , and temperature , respectively .",
    "thus , a strictly jammed state requires @xmath11 since this state should be incompressible .",
    "indeed , prior simulation works for the strict jammed state of hard spheres show @xmath12 to within numerical resolution @xcite .",
    "the observation @xmath13 has been termed `` hyperuniformity , '' in that the density looks increasingly uniform when considered on longer length scales @xcite .",
    "the first physics study of the internal structure of a random closed packed system that we are aware of is the work of smith , foote , and busang @xcite . in 1929",
    ", they studied the packing of shot and used acid to mark the contacts between spheres , reporting the contact numbers for 1,562 particles taken from the interior of a sample with 2,400 particles . in the 1960 s ,",
    "bernal first studied 500 particles taken from the interior of a sample with 5,000 particles @xcite , and later 1,000 particles @xcite .",
    "in more recent times , 16,000 spheres were studied by slotterback _",
    "et al . _ who used an index - matching fluid and laser - sheet illumination to find the positions @xcite",
    "used x - ray tomography to study several different granular packings containing 90,000 particles in an interior region @xcite .",
    "these experiments provide useful data for testing theories and studying the properties of rcp packings on large length scales .    in this article ,",
    "we use a sedimented dense colloidal suspension as an experimental realization of a rcp material , in the loose sense of rcp rather than the strict sense of a mrj state .",
    "we study the detailed structure of our sample with confocal microscopy , which can determine the three - dimensional positions of the particle centers to high accuracy . by carefully imaging overlapping regions ,",
    "we observe a large volume containing over 450,000 particles .",
    "our data set is available online @xcite .",
    "the data are used to determine which features of our realistic rcp system are similar to the stricter ideal mrj packing .",
    "the sample satisfies several criteria for randomness , for example , having only a tiny fraction of particles having even short - range order .",
    "however , in contrast to simulated mrj packings , we find the isothermal compressibility is not zero , thus suggesting that in at least this particular experimental realization of a rcp system , there are differences with simulations .",
    "it is important to note that our colloidal experiment differs in several particulars from both granular experiments ( such as the early ones with ball bearings @xcite ) and simulations .",
    "first , the particles are not all identical ; they have a polydispersity of 5% in their diameters .",
    "second , as the rcp state is formed by sedimentation , the particles have a chance to diffuse due to brownian motion . in some situations",
    "this motion can help particles rearrange into crystalline packings , if the sample has a volume fraction in the range @xmath14 @xcite . while our experimental preparation method avoids full crystallization , it is plausible that the sample could be more ordered as a result of subtle rearrangements as particles sediment toward their final positions .",
    "however , conventionally such sedimented colloidal samples are thought of as rcp states .",
    "our primary motivation is to use our sample to discern properties of the rcp state , and test the applicability of ideas derived from simulation .",
    "we use poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) particles sterically stabilized with poly-12-hydroxystearic acid @xcite . to visualize the particles ,",
    "they are dyed with rhodamine 6 g @xcite .",
    "the mean diameter @xmath15 of our particles is @xmath16  @xmath17 m with an uncertainty 1% .",
    "additionally the particles have a polydispersity of @xmath18% . according to prior simulations ,",
    "the volume fraction for random close packing @xmath3 is between 0.64 and 0.66 for a 5% polydisperse system @xcite , which is almost same as @xmath3 for monodisperse spheres .",
    "references @xcite point out that the specific value often depends on the simulation details .",
    "we use a fast laser scanning confocal microscope ( vt - eye , visitech ) which yields clear images deep inside our dense samples . despite the high density ,",
    "the colloidal particles can be easily discerned as shown in fig .",
    "[ image ] .",
    "we acquire three - dimensional ( 3d ) scans of our sample yielding a @xmath19  @xmath17m@xmath20 observation volume for each image . as the sample is jammed , particles do not move and we can scan slowly to achieve very clean images : each 3d scan takes about 30  s. within each 3d image , particles are identified within 0.03  @xmath17 m in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and within 0.05  @xmath17 m in @xmath23 @xcite .    ,",

    ", width=226 ]    the pmma particles are initially suspended in a mixture of 85% cyclohexylbromide and 15% decalin by weight .",
    "this mixture closely matches both the density and refractive index of the particles @xcite .",
    "then , to induce the particles to sediment , we add a small amount of decalin to slightly decrease the density of the dispersion fluid .    we can quantify the importance of sedimentation by computing the nondimensional peclet number .",
    "this is the ratio of the time for a particle to diffuse its own radius @xmath24 to the time for it to fall a distance @xmath24 .",
    "the diffusion time scale is @xmath25 , using the diffusion constant @xmath26 , which for our particles and solvent is @xmath27  @xmath17m@xmath28/s .",
    "this gives us @xmath29  s. the sedimentation time scale is @xmath30 .",
    "we observe the height of the sediment as a function of time in a macroscopic sample of dilute particles , and find @xmath31  @xmath17 m/s , giving us @xmath32",
    "s. thus pe @xmath33 , suggesting that particles can diffuse long distances while they sediment ; an alternate implication is that hydrodynamic interactions between particles due to sedimentation are perhaps less important than diffusion @xcite .",
    "prior to the start of sedimentation , the initial volume fraction is about 0.30 ( in the stable liquid phase ) .",
    "we stir the particles by ultrasonic wave before sedimentation to avoid the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite . during sedimentation",
    ", the sample passes through the volume fraction range where crystals can be nucleated , approximately @xmath34 for our sample with 5% polydispersity @xcite .",
    "we do not observe crystals in our final sample , and the most likely explanation is that sedimentation happens faster than nucleation , which is quite slow for polydisperse samples @xcite . for samples with @xmath35 , we do observe crystallization , although we have not carefully studied the critical @xmath36 for which crystallization is suppressed ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussion .",
    "given that diffusion is faster than sedimentation , the sample readily equilibrates , at least at low volume fractions as the sedimentation starts .",
    "hence , we believe that our final state is well - defined and insensitive to the initial state . during sedimentation , the stokes drag force acting on the particles is given by @xmath37 , with viscosity @xmath38  mpa@xmath39s and @xmath40 .",
    "the buoyant weight of the particles is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath43 being the density difference . balancing the gravitational force with the drag force , we can estimate the density difference as @xmath44  g / cm@xmath20 . for reference ,",
    "the particle density is 1.2340 g / cm@xmath20 .",
    "balancing the gravitational energy @xmath46 with the thermal energy @xmath47 lets us determine the scale height @xmath48  @xmath17 m ( using @xmath9 as boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "the small scale height suggests that in the final sedimented state , there will be no density stratification except right at the interface between the dense sediment and the remaining solvent ; that interface will have a thickness @xmath49 .    during the sedimentation process",
    ", it takes about 2 days for the sample to initially sediment to the bottom and form a glassy state .",
    "however , the sedimentation speed is slow at high @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "thus , we wait 90 days to complete the sedimentation before we put the sample on the microscope .",
    "we also re - checked the sample 300 days after the initial sediment , and found the same results as a 90 day old sample .",
    "we use the convention that the @xmath22 direction is the axis corresponding to gravity during the sedimentation process ( see fig .  [ image ] ) .",
    "the sample chamber is made from glass slides and coverslips , sealed with uv - curing epoxy ( norland ) , with the sample dimensions being @xmath51  mm , @xmath52  mm , and @xmath53  mm .",
    "when we measure the structure , we lay our sample on the microscope ; that is , the optical @xmath23 axis is parallel to gravity and the microscope looks into the thinnest dimension of the sample chamber ( for ease of viewing ) . in the highly concentrated sample ,",
    "any subsequent gravity - induced particle rearrangements are much slower than our measuring time . in particular",
    ", we do not observe any particle flow in the sample , and the structure does not change at all during measurement . near the flat coverslip of our sample chamber , particles layer against the wall @xcite . to avoid influence of this , we take our 3d images at about 1 mm above the @xmath22 axis sample chamber bottom and at about 15 @xmath17 m above the glass slide along the @xmath23 axis .",
    "simulations show that wall effects decay fairly rapidly ( @xmath54 diameters = 10 @xmath17 m ) @xcite , and in our data we see no density fluctuations as a function of the distance @xmath23 away from the coverslip .",
    "of course , sedimentation with hydrodynamic interactions and brownian motion is not a protocol followed in simulations of rcp states .",
    "the algorithm developed by lubachevsky and stillinger considers hard particles moving ballistically @xcite .",
    "the particles start very small , and continue interacting as they gradually are swelled until the system jams .",
    "the method of ohern and co - workers is similar , starting with small particles that grow , but their particles are not infinitely hard , nor do they have velocities @xcite .",
    "rather , the simulation proceeds until the particles are maximally swelled but non - overlapping , thus giving the final hard - sphere state .",
    "tobochnik and chapin devised a similar algorithm which used monte carlo moves to eliminate overlaps @xcite .",
    "these `` expand and eliminate the overlap '' methods are similar to an earlier method due to jodrey and tory which slowly shrank spheres , sliding pairs of spheres linearly to minimize their overlap , until all spheres had no overlaps @xcite .",
    "these methods all have the strength that the rcp state is generated isotropically , in contrast to our experiment where gravity sets a direction .",
    "( as discussed below , we do not see anything special about the direction of gravity in our data . )",
    "our experimental method does have the feature that our spheres never overlap , in contrast to algorithms where overlaps are allowed at intermediate stages @xcite , although it is not obvious that intermediate stage overlaps would cause substantially different results in the final state .",
    "in some ways our experimental protocol is similar to a method by visscher and bolsterli from 1972 @xcite .",
    "their algorithm dropped particles at random positions until the particles collided with the floor or a previous particle ; the falling particle then rolls downhill until it reaches a locally stable position . in our experiment ,",
    "all the particles fall simultaneously , and also their brownian motion gives them the ability to find better packings than the visscher and bolsterli algorithm .      to take a large ensemble , we scan a grid of 3d images with a small amount of overlap in @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we compute particle positions from each image and then we connect one image to an adjacent overlapping image .",

    "finally , we calculate the sum of the squared distances between the positions of the overlapped particles within each region , and find the global choices of shift values that minimize the overall squared error , to provide the most accurate shift factors for the overlap . using the shift factors , we then link up the particle positions in adjacent sections .",

    "the decay of @xmath156 in an experiment is related to the broadness of each peak , that is , @xmath156 decays quickly when peaks are slightly broad .",
    "broad peaks mean that a distance between two particles are distributed .",
    "hence , the rapid decay of @xmath156 are also connected with the fluctuations in density , supporting the result @xmath166 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the arrangement in our experiment is not a strictly jammed state .",
    "it is important to note that uncertainty in particle positions will broaden the first peak of @xmath156 , but this does not strongly affect @xmath156 for larger @xmath167 as those uncertainties do not accumulate over large distances .",
    "that is , the true separation between two particles has a distance @xmath168 with an uncertainty of @xmath169  @xmath17 m , which is somewhat significant when @xmath168 is small and less important when @xmath168 is large .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this observed `` softness . ''",
    "one possibility is the polydispersity of colloidal size which is a crucial reality for experimental situations , and a difference with the simulations to which we are comparing our data .",
    "when particle sizes are slightly different , the minimum distance between two particles can be changed from @xmath170 and then the first peak of @xmath156 becomes slightly broad , consistent with fig .",
    "this small difference adds up over a long distance and then it may induce long wavelength fluctuations . in particular , the local fluctuations in composition ( slightly more large particles or small particles ) are coupled to the number fluctuations .",
    "a polydispersity of 5% such as we have in our experiment results in @xmath171 based on simulations @xcite , consistent with our data .",
    "unfortunately , we can not determine the individual particle sizes as the resolution of optical microscopy blurs particle images on the same scale as the variability of particle size .",
    "furthermore , images of neighboring particles overlap , again due to the finite optical resolution .",
    "this makes determining individual particle size problematic , and prevents us from disentangling the influence of polydispersity from our data .",
    "a second possibility is that our sample is not at random close packing due to friction effects between the particles , which is quite important for granular packings .",
    "it is known that granular packings are often looser than rcp , with volume fractions as low as @xmath172 , termed `` random loose packing '' @xcite . by vibrating the system ,",
    "the packing fraction can be increased , perhaps coming close to rcp @xcite . in our experiment ,",
    "particles move by brownian motion , and this may let them find the rcp state . furthermore ,",
    "the particles are sterically stabilized to prevent them from sticking together . in general",
    ", friction is not a concept that is usually applied to colloidal particles .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out the possibility of some possible occasional attractive interaction between our particles which might result in friction - like behavior , resulting in a slightly loose packing .",
    "small amounts of static friction gave nonzero @xmath141 values in simulations @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is based on the @xmath123 dependence of the local volume fraction ( fig .  [ local](a ) ) , that is , particles in more ordered local environments are packed better .",
    "the crystalline particles , which have high local volume fraction , are distributed throughout the sample ( see fig .  [ local](b ) ) . to quantify the spatial distribution of the crystalline particles ,",
    "we calculate a crystalline structure factor @xmath150 as @xmath173 where @xmath174 = 1 when @xmath57 particle is classed as crystalline , otherwise @xmath174 = 0 .",
    "@xmath150 is the average of @xmath175 over @xmath113 .",
    "the square symbols in fig .",
    "[ sq](b ) correspond to @xmath150 and we find that @xmath150 can be fitted with ornstein - zernike function [ dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sq](b ) ] .",
    "this fit gives us that the typical length scale between the crystalline particles is @xmath176 .",
    "thus , the spatial distribution of crystalline particles can induce density fluctuations with long wavelength and it might be another reason for our observation that @xmath166 .",
    "it is worth noting that the small but nonzero fraction of the crystallites ( less than 3% ) is crucial in this conjecture .",
    "it is possible that these tiny crystallites are due to brownian motion during the sedimentation .",
    "we are unaware of any measurements of tiny crystallites in simulations of random close packing , although one recent study of a binary mixture of spheres used the same order parameter that we do and found the average number of ordered bonds ( our @xmath123 ) was small @xcite .",
    "we use confocal microscopy to study both the local and long - range structure of a random close packed colloidal suspension .",
    "we find that the fraction of crystalline particles is at most 3% , and furthermore that almost no regions in the sample have icosohedral order ( less than 0.01% ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the sample is randomly packed .",
    "this is further supported by the distribution of voronoi volumes , which is well fit by a prediction based on a model of random packing .",
    "we also compute the static structure factor @xmath112 and find that @xmath177 , in contrast to simulations which found @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "@xmath141 is proportional to the isothermal compressibility , implying that the simulated states are essentially incompressible ( to within numerical precision ) , while our experimental sample is compressible .",
    "this may be due to the presence of tiny crystalline regions in our sample , which are associated with slightly higher local density ( and thus give rise to long wavelength density fluctuations ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be due to the polydispersity of particle sizes in the experiment ( @xmath18% ) .",
    "this softness ( @xmath166 ) is crucial to how the sample would respond to an external force , for example , shear stress .",
    "the viscosity and elasticity of a sample are extremely sensitive to density near jamming point @xcite . near the jammed state , small fluctuations in density result in large fluctuations of viscosity and elasticity , which can lead to shear instability or cracking @xcite .",
    "this suggests that real - world rcp materials may possess nontrivially different properties from idealized simulations .",
    "our work points to polydispersity and sample preparation as the possible origin of these differences , both of which are worthy of further exploration in both simulation and experiment .",
