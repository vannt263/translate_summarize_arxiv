    "when a strong field is applied to a composite medium , the induced change of the medium can lead to spectacular behavior , both in electrical transport and in optical response @xcite .",
    "if a strong electric field is applied to a suspension of particles where the particles have a large electric polarizability , the induced dipole moments of the particles can order the suspended particles into a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice @xcite .",
    "this process is known as the electrorheological ( er ) effect .",
    "recently , tao and coworkers @xcite proposed that a structure transformation from the bct ground state to some other lattices can occur when one simultaneously applies a magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field and the polarized particles possess magnetic dipole moments .",
    "sheng and coworkers @xcite verified the proposal experimentally and observed a structure transformation from the bct to face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices .",
    "motivated by these studies , we propose an alternative structure transformation from the bct to the fcc structure , through the application of electric fields only .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we will adopt the point - dipole approximation @xcite and calculate the dipole lattice sum via the ewald - kornfeld formulation in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the effects of a structure change on the local field when the lattice constants vary .",
    "if we change the uniaxial lattice constant under the hard - sphere condition , a series of transformations occur among the bct ground state , body - centered cubic ( bcc ) , intermediate and fcc lattices ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the results will be compared with those of a tetragonal lattice .",
    "we also make a contact with macroscopic concept and derive the clausius - mossotti equation . in section iv , we will compute the dipole interaction energy as a function of various lattices and discuss a possible structure transformation by the application of rotating electric fields . discussion and conclusion on our results",
    "will be given .",
    "in this section , we apply the ewald - kornfeld formulation @xcite to compute the local electric field for a bct lattice of point dipoles .",
    "the bct lattice can be regarded as a tetragonal lattice , plus a basis of two point dipoles , one of which is located at a corner and the other of which at the body center of the tetragonal unit cell .",
    "the tetragonal lattice has a lattice constant @xmath1 along the z - axis and lattice constants @xmath2 along the x and y axes .",
    "the volume of the tetragonal unit cell remains @xmath3 as @xmath4 varies . in this way",
    ", the degree of anisotropy of the tetragonal lattice is measured by how @xmath4 is deviated from unity and the uniaxial anisotropic axis is along the z - axis .",
    "so far , the lattice parameter @xmath5 remains arbitrary .",
    "for hard spheres in an er solid , however , the lattice parameter @xmath5 can be determined from the relation : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the radius of the spheres .",
    "the hard sphere condition requires @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for the bct ground state , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while for the fcc lattice , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the bcc lattice is characterized by @xmath14 .",
    "each sphere has a point dipole embedded at its center .",
    "the lattice vector of the tetragonal lattice is given by @xmath15where @xmath16 are integers .",
    "suppose there are @xmath17 point dipoles @xmath18 located at @xmath19 in a unit cell .",
    "the local electric field @xmath20 at a particular point dipole at @xmath19 can be expressed as a sum of the electric field of all dipoles at @xmath21 : @xmath22where `` prime '' denotes a restricted summation which excludes @xmath23 when @xmath24 and @xmath25is the dipole interaction tensor .",
    "eq.([dipole - sum ] ) can be recast in the ewald - kornfeld form @xcite : @xmath26      \\nonumber \\\\   & - & { 4\\pi \\over v_c } \\sum_{{\\bf g } \\neq 0 }     { 1\\over g^2 } \\exp \\left(-{g^2\\over 4\\eta^2 } \\right )     [ ( { \\bf p}_i \\cdot { \\bf g } ) \\exp(i{\\bf g } \\cdot { \\bf r}_i )     \\sum_j ( { \\bf p}_j \\cdot { \\bf g } ) \\exp(-i{\\bf g } \\cdot { \\bf r}_j ) ]     \\nonumber \\\\   & + & { 4\\eta^3 p_i^2 \\over 3\\sqrt{\\pi } } , \\label{e - k}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is an adjustable parameter and * g * is a reciprocal lattice vector : @xmath29the @xmath30 and @xmath31 coefficients are given by : @xmath32where @xmath33 is the complementary error function .",
    "thus the dipole lattice sum of eq.([dipole - sum ] ) becomes a summation over the real lattice vector * r * as well as the reciprocal lattice vector * g*. here we have considered an infinite lattice . for finite lattices , one must be careful about the effects of different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we should remark that although a tetragonal lattice is considered , eq.([e - k ] ) is applicable to arbitrary bravais lattices .",
    "the adjustable parameter @xmath28 is chosen so that both the summations in the real and reciprocal lattices converge most rapidly . in what follows ,",
    "we will limit ourselves to the bct cell with two dipoles per tetragonal cell , and the ewald - kornfeld summation [ eq.([e - k ] ) ] can be carried out .",
    "we will consider two cases depending on whether the dipole moment is parallel or perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis . in both cases",
    ", we will compute the local field as a function of the degree of anisotropy @xmath4 .",
    "consider the longitudinal field case : @xmath34 , i.e. , the dipole moments being along the uniaxial anisotropic axis .",
    "the local field * e * at the the lattice point * r * = 0 reduces to @xmath35   - { 4\\pi p\\over v_c } \\sum_{{\\bf g}\\neq 0 } s({\\bf g } ) { g_z^2\\over g^2 }    \\exp\\left({-g^2\\over 4\\eta^2}\\right ) + { 4p\\eta^3\\over { 3\\sqrt\\pi}},\\end{aligned}\\]]and @xmath36 . in the equation , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively given by : @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] is the structure factor .",
    "the local field will be computed by summing over all integer indices , @xmath41 for the summation in the real lattice and @xmath42 for that in the reciprocal lattice .",
    "because of the exponential factors , we may impose an upper limit to the indices , i.e. , all indices ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is a positive integer . for @xmath45",
    ", the regions of summation will be rectangular rather than cubic in both the real and reciprocal lattices .",
    "the computation has been repeated for various degree of anisotropy with @xmath4 ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 .",
    "a plateau value for @xmath46 is found for each @xmath4 within a certain range of @xmath28 values : @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , the calculations with @xmath48 yield numerical results already accurate up to 16 significant figures , indicating that convergence of the local field has indeed been achieved with the upper limit @xmath49 . for larger anisotropy ( either @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) , a spherical region of summation can help the convergence @xcite .    for the transverse field case in which the dipole moments are perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis , eq.(8 )",
    "can still be applied to evaluate the local field by modifying @xmath52 to @xmath53 while taking the gradient along the direction of the dipole , say the x - axis , and obtain the expression of the local field .",
    "the results of the local field strength ( normalized to @xmath54 ) against @xmath55 for the longitudinal and transverse field cases are plotted in fig.2(a ) and fig.2(b ) respectively . for comparison , the corresponding results for a tetragonal lattice @xcite",
    "( i.e. , in the absence of the body centers ) are also plotted on the same figure .",
    "as @xmath4 decreases , the local field for the longitudinal field case increases rapidly while that for the transverse field case decreases rapidly . in both cases ,",
    "when @xmath4 deviates from unity , the effect of anisotropy has a pronounced effect on the local field strengths .    unlike the tetragonal case",
    ", the local field of the bct lattice does not vary much near @xmath56 .",
    "when we magnify the scales in fig.2(c ) and fig.2(d ) , we observe a non - monotonic behavior as @xmath4 increases : as @xmath0 increases from bct , the local field initially decreases rapidly towards the isotropic value at bcc , decreases further , reaching a minimum value and increases , passing through the isotropic value again at an intermediate lattice , reaches a maximum value and finally decreases to the fcc value .",
    "the isotropic value of the intermediate lattice is attributed to the symmetry of the dipole interaction tensor .",
    "our present theory is of microscopic origin , in the sense that we have computed the lattice summation by the ewald - kornfeld formulation .",
    "we have not invoked any macroscopic concepts like the lorentz cavity field @xcite in the calculations . however , to corroborate with these established concepts can lead to a modification of the clausius - mossotti equation .",
    "more precisely , we use the result of the local field to evaluate the effective polarizability @xmath57 of the dipole lattice . the total field acting on a dipole",
    "is the sum of the applied field @xmath58 and the local field due to all other dipoles , hence @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the polarizability of an isolated dipole and @xmath61 is the local field factor .",
    "we will use @xmath62 and @xmath63 to denote the local field factors parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis .",
    "note that @xmath64 when @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath65 , the above equation becomes a self - consistent equation .",
    "solving yields @xmath66the effective dielectric constant @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 .",
    "thus , @xmath69where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for the bcc lattice , @xmath72",
    ", @xmath67 satisfies the well - known clausius - mossotti equation .",
    "thus eq.(10 ) represents a generalization of the clausius - mossotti equation to the bct lattices .",
    "the results of the local field strength as well as the generalized clausius - mossotti equation allow us to compute the dipole interaction energy per particle in the er solid , similar to calculations of tao and coworkers @xcite .",
    "if an uniaxial field @xmath73 is applied , the dipole interaction energy per particle is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the dielectric constant of the host medium .",
    "since @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath78 as @xmath4 increases from the bct ground state to the fcc structures , the volume of the unit cell increases initially , reaching a maximum at the bcc structure , then decreases to the fcc structure .",
    "as the local electric field strength remains almost constant in the range @xmath79 , the increase in the magnitude of the dipole energy per particle is attributed to the decrease in the volume of the unit cell . concomitantly ,",
    "as shown in fig.3 , the energy per particle initially increases from the bct ground state , reaching a maximum near the bcc structure and then decreases all the way towards the fcc structure .",
    "the transformation involves climbing up an energy barrier beyond which the fcc structure becomes stable , which is in contrast with the smooth and monotonic transition proposed in previous work @xcite .",
    "next we apply a rotating electric field @xmath80 in the plane perpendicular to the uniaxial electric field , where @xmath81 is the ratio of the rotating to axial field strength .",
    "the instantaneous electric fields are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the angular velocity of the rotating field and @xmath85 is an arbitrary phase angle . in this case",
    ", the dipole interaction energy per particle is modified to : @xmath86 as shown in fig.3 , when we increase the ratio @xmath87 , the bct ground state energy increases while the fcc energy remains unchanged , but there is still an energy barrier between the bct and fcc states for small @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath88 , the energy barrier disappears and the fcc structure is the most stable . physically one has to break the chains to make the structure transformation possible when the strength of the rotating electric field is sufficiently large .    from the energy consideration ,",
    "we suggest that the structure transformation be realized in experiments by applying a rotating electric field in the plane perpendicular to the uniaxial electric field . in this field configuration , both the time average value of the induced dipole moment and that of the rotating electric field vanish in the plane .",
    "however , the instantaneous dipole moment will induce an overall attractive force between the particles in the plane perpendicular to the uniaxial field .",
    "this is very different from the previous transformation proposed by tao et al @xcite and experimentally verified by sheng and coworkers @xcite by using crossed electric and magnetic fields on microparticles which possess permanent magnetic dipole moments . in our case , the field configuration is all electrical ; no magnetic field and/or magnetic materials need to be used .",
    "alternatively , we may apply the same rotating electric field configuration to a magnetorheological fluid to achieve the structure transformation .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order .",
    "as mentioned in ref@xcite , the energy difference between the fcc and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) structures is very small , and is comparable to the thermal energy , there is a competition between these structures .",
    "therefore , we will likely find an fcc - hcp mixed structure .",
    "however , it appears that our field configuration helps a four - fold symmetry in the plane of the rotating field and the fcc structures may be more favorable .",
    "nevertheless , we are awaiting experimental evidence on the proposed structure transformation .",
    "our calculations have been performed up to the point - dipole approximation , which is in the same spirit as done by tao et al @xcite .",
    "a dipole - induced - dipole ( did ) model , which takes into account the mutual polarization effect between touching particles , can drastically improve the accuracy towards the fully multipolar calculations @xcite . since the did contribution becomes important for small reduced separation @xmath89 @xcite , we can simplify the calculations by limiting ourselves to touching spheres only .",
    "we may omit the nontouching spheres ( unless the spheres get very close so that @xmath89 ) .",
    "each sphere is in contact with 8 neighboring spheres in the bct lattices and 12 neighboring spheres in the fcc lattice and the number of did images dipoles is therefore finite .",
    "the generalization thus includes the original point dipoles as well as all the did images dipoles at well - defined positions in the unit cell and the general formula [ eq.(4 ) ] can indeed be used .",
    "the incorporation of the more accurate did model into the ewald - kornfeld formulation is underway .",
    "however , we believe that the point - dipole results remain qualitatively correct .    in conclusion , we have applied the ewald - kornfeld formulation to a bct lattice of point dipoles to examine the effects of structure transformation on the local field distribution .",
    "we have found that the local field exhibits a non - monotonic transition from bct to fcc .",
    "moreover , we showed that the change in the local field can lead to a generalized clausius - mossotti equation for the bct lattices .",
