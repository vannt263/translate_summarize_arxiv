    "between about 1.5 and 10 m@xmath0 , at spectral types a and b , about 5% of main sequence ( ms ) stars have magnetic fields with characteristic strengths of about 1 kg . such stars also show important chemical peculiarities and are thus usually called the magnetic chemically peculiar ap / bp stars .",
    "two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of their magnetic fields : the core dynamo hypothesis and the fossil field hypothesis .",
    "the core dynamo hypothesis assumes that a magnetic field is generated in the convective core of the main sequence ( ms ) ap / bp stars , and then diffuses towards the surface . on the contrary",
    ", the fossil field hypothesis assumes that the stellar magnetic fields are relics from the field present in the parental interstellar cloud or possibly generated early in their evolution , by a dynamo that has ceased to operate .",
    "it implies that magnetic fields can ( at least partially ) survive the violent phenomena accompanying the birth of stars , and can also remain throughout their evolution and until at least the end of the ms , without significant regeneration .",
    "according to the fossil field model , some pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars of intermediate mass should be magnetic .",
    "many such pms stars are identifiable observationally as herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars .",
    "however no magnetic field was observed up to recently in these stars ( except in hd  104237 , donati et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "_ can we obtain observational evidence of the presence of magnetic fields in pms a / b stars , as predicted by the fossil field hypothesis ? if some haebe stars are discovered to have magnetic fields ,",
    "is the fraction of magnetic to non - magnetic haebe stars the same as the fraction for main sequence stars ?",
    "are the magnetic fields in haebe stars strong enough and of appropriate geometry to explain those of the ap / bp stars ?",
    "_    chemical peculiarities and magnetism are not the only characteristic properties observed in the ap / bp stars .",
    "most magnetic ms stars have rotation periods ( typically of a few days ) that are several times longer than the rotation periods of non - magnetic ms stars ( a few hours to one day ) .",
    "it is usually believed that magnetic braking , in particular during pms evolution when the star can exchange angular momentum with its massive accretion disk , is responsible for this slow rotation ( stpie , 2000 ) .",
    "an alternative to this picture involves a rapid dissipation of the magnetic field during the early stages of pms evolution for the fastest rotators , due to strong turbulence induced by rotational shear developed under the stellar surface , as occurs in solar - type stars ( e.g. lignires , 1996 ) . in this scenario",
    ", only slow rotators could retain their initial magnetic fields , and evolve as magnetic stars to the main sequence .",
    "so another question to be addressed is the following : _ does the magnetic field control the rotation of the star , or does the rotation of the star control the magnetic field ? _    to answer to these questions we adopt two strategies .",
    "the first consists of observing the brightest `` field '' haebe stars in order to detect magnetic fields , to measure rotation velocities and finally to make a statistical study to be compared to the statistical properties of magnetism and rotation of the main sequence a / b stars .",
    "the second strategy consists of observing haebe stars in young open clusters and associations . observing stars in a single cluster or association will provide us with stars of approximately the same age and initial conditions ( chemical composition , angular momentum , environment ) .",
    "then , by selecting members of open clusters and associations of various ages , we hope to be able to disentangle `` evolutionary '' effects from `` initial conditions '' effects .",
    "thanks to both studies we will therefore improve our understanding of the evolution of the magnetic field during the pre - main sequence phase , and its impact on the evolution of the stars .",
    "the ms a and b stars are intermediate - mass ( 1.5 to 15  m@xmath0 ) stars . the main difference between ms intermediate mass stars and ms low - mass star is their internal structure .",
    "a low - mass star has a radiative core and a convective envelope , while a and b stars have a convective core and a radiative envelope . in low - mass stars ,",
    "magnetic fields are generated by dynamos in their convective envelope .",
    "we understand therefore the necessity to involve a different origin for the magnetic field of the intermediate mass stars .    during their pre - main sequence phase",
    "the intermediate and low mass stars follow a different evolution , which is fundamental in understanding the origin of magnetic fields . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ( left ) are plotted the pms evolutionary tracks ( full black lines ) computed with the cesam code ( morel 1997 ) , for different masses ( from 1.5 to 20 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "the pms evolution starts with a fully convective phase on the hayashi track ( the vertical part ) . during many years",
    ", the fossil field hypothesis was considered to be unlikely because magnetic field relics would have been dissipated during this convective phase .",
    "however palla & stahler ( 1993 ) modelled proto - stellar evolution until the star becomes optically visible by clearing away its opaque envelope .",
    "they defined the birthline as the locus in the hr diagram of these newly formed stars , and they computed it using two different mass accretion rates during the protostellar phase : 10@xmath1  m@xmath0.yr@xmath2 and 10@xmath3  m@xmath0.yr@xmath2 . both birthlines are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ( left ) in small dashed - lines .",
    "the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) computed with cesam is also plotted in long dashed - line .",
    "the pms lifetime of a star is therefore from the birthline to the zams .",
    "it implies that the hayashi phase of intermediate mass stars is considerably reduced for stars between 1.5 @xmath4 and 3 @xmath4 and disappears totally above 3  @xmath4 .",
    "fossil magnetic fields can therefore survive during the pms evolution of intermediate mass stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] are also plotted the convective envelope disappearance and the convective core appearance lines , calculated with cesam . during the pms phase stars experience three different internal structures : either a radiative core and a convective envelope , or a totally radiative interior , or a convective core and a radiative envelope .",
    "the pms stars of intermediate mass stars are therefore very suitable laboratories to test both hypotheses of magnetic field origin .",

    "they are distinguished from the classical be stars by their abnormal extinction law and association with nebulae .",
    "most of them are still in the pre - main sequence phase , and therefore the evolutionary progenitors of the ms a and b stars .",
    "haebe stars display many observational phenomena often associated with magnetic activity .",
    "first , highly ionised lines are observed in the spectra of some stars ( e.g. bouret et .",
    "al . , 1997 ) , and x - ray emission has been detected coming from the environments of haebe stars ( e.g. hamaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . in active cool stars , many of these phenomena are produced in hot chromospheres or coronae .",
    "some authors have also mentioned rotational modulation of resonance lines which they speculate may be due to rotation modulation of winds structured by magnetic field ( e.g. catala et al .",
    "1989 ) .    in the literature",
    "we find many clues to the presence of circumstellar disks around these stars , from spectroscopic and photometric data ( e.g. vink et al .",
    "recently , using coronographic and interferometric data , some authors have also found direct evidence of circumstellar disks around these stars ( e.g. eisner et al .",
    "these disks show similar properties to the disks of their low mass counterparts ( natta et al .",

    "finally muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have sucessfully applied their magnetospheric accretion model to one haebe star to explain the emission lines in its spectrum .",
    "for all these reasons we suspect that the haebe stars may host large - scale magnetic fields that should be detectable with current instrumentation .",
    "however , many authors have tried to detect such fields without much success ( catala et al .",
    "1989 , 1993 ; donati et al . 1997 ; hubrig et al . 2004",
    "; wade et al .",
    "the previous instruments were limited either by their spectral range , or by their spectral resolution , or by low efficiency . however , in 2005 a new high - resolution spectropolarimeter , espadons , was installed at the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "this powerful new instrument has provided us with the capability to sensitively survey many haebe stars in order to investigate rotation and magnetism in the pre - main sequence stars of intermediate mass .",
    "our data were obtained using the high resolution spectropolarimeter espadons installed on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht , donati et al . , in preparation ; neiner 2008 , these proceedings ) during several scientific runs .",
    "we used this instrument in polarimetric mode , measuring stokes @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra of 65000 resolution .",
    "the data were reduced using the `` libre esprit '' package especially developed for espadons , and installed at the cfht ( donati et al .",
    "1997 ; donati et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we then applied the least squares deconvolution procedure to all spectra ( donati et al .",
    "1997 ) , in order to increase our signal to noise ratio .",
    "this method assumes that all selected lines of the intensity spectrum have a profile of similar shape .",
    "hence , this supposes that all lines are broadened in the same way .",
    "we can therefore consider that the observed spectrum is a convolution between a profile ( which is the same for all lines ) and a mask including all choosen lines of the spectrum .",
    "we therefore apply a deconvolution to the observed spectrum using the mask , in order to obtain the average photospheric profiles of stokes @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this procedure",
    ", each line is weighted by its signal to noise ratio , its depth in the unbroadened model and its land factor .",
    "for each star we used a mask computed using `` extract stellar '' line lists obtained from the vienna atomic line database ( vald)vald/ ] , with effective temperatures and @xmath7 suitable for each star ( wade et al . in prep . ) .",
    "we excluded from this mask hydrogen balmer lines , strong resonance lines , lines whose land factor is unknown and emission lines .",
    "the results of this procedure are the mean stokes @xmath5 and stokes @xmath6 lsd profiles .",

    "we observe that these signatures are located at the same position as the absorption line , and are as broad as the intensity profile .",
    "they are therefore characteristic of the presence of magnetic fields in the stars .",
    "as our sample contains 55 stars , the first conclusion that we draw is that  7% of our sample haebe stars are magnetic .    in order to characterise these magnetic fields , we monitored the four detected stars during many nights .",
    "we recorded variations of the zeeman signature with time for all stars , except one ( hd  190073 ) , which exhibits a constant profile . to model these variations we assume the oblique rotator model described in landstreet ( 1970 ) .",
    "this model assumes a dipole of intensity @xmath8 placed at a distance @xmath9 of the center of the star , on the magnetic axis inside the star , and inclined with an angle @xmath10 to the rotation axis .",
    "the rotation axis make an angle @xmath11 with the line of sight . as the star rotates with a period @xmath12 , the magnetic configuration at the visible surface of the star , and therefore the stokes @xmath6 profile , changes with the rotation phase .",
    "we calculated on each point of the observable surface of the star a local intensity @xmath13 profile using a gaussian of instrumental width placed at the local velocity .",
    "using the weak field approximation ( landi deglinnocenti & landi deglinnocenti 1973 ) , we calculated the local stokes @xmath14 profile as a function of @xmath15 and the local magnetic field projected on the line of sight @xmath16 .",
    "we then integrated @xmath13 and @xmath14 over the stellar surface , using the linear limb - darkening law with a suitable coefficient value for the star ( claret 2000 ) , in order to get the stokes @xmath5 and @xmath6 profiles .",
    "this model is therefore dependent on 6 parameters : the rotation period @xmath12 , the reference time of the rotation phase @xmath17 , the magnetic obliquity @xmath10 , the inclination of the rotation axis @xmath11 , the dipole intensity @xmath8 , and the position @xmath9 of the dipole on the magnetic axis with respect to the center of the star .",
    "we fitted the observed stokes @xmath5 profiles to the synthetic ones , described above , then we calculated a grid of synthetic stokes @xmath6 profiles by varying the 6 parameters . finally , we fitted all observed @xmath6 profiles of a single star by a @xmath18 minimisation .",

    "all these hypotheses are consistent with a dipolar field inside the star , which is further strengthened by the fact that the zeeman signature is a simple bipolar signature which is stable over more than 2 years .    finally , we mention two other detections obtained using the semelpol polarimeter and the ucles spectrograph at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) ( semel et al .",

    "the fitted function is the convolution of a rotation function ( for which @xmath19 is a free parameter in the fit ) and a gaussian whose width is fixed and computed from the spectral resolution and the inferred macroturbulent velocity ( gray 1992 ) .",
    "the free parameters of the fitting procedure are the centroids , depths , and @xmath19 .    in our study , we separated the stars of our sample in two different groups : the magnetic haebe stars , and the normal haebe stars which contains the non - magnetic and non - multiple stars ( as the tidal interactions between both components of a binary system are braking both stars , we prefer to not include them in our study of the rotational evolution during the pms phase ) .    in fig .",

    "even though the inclination angles are not known and the true equatorial velocities of the stars are not known , it is clear that the magnetic haebe stars , as a population , are slower rotators than the normal haebe stars .",

    "this slower and narrower @xmath19 distribution reflects the large range of ages and radii of the haebe sample .",
    "however these effects are small compared to what is expected during the entire pms phase , according to the angular momentum conservation ( @xmath19 should increase by a factor between 2 and 3 , rather than 1.5 as observed ) .",
    "we explain this by the fact that most of our sample have less than 50% of their pms evolution remaining , during which the radius decrease is very small compared to the first part of the pms phase ( alecian et al .",

    "our sample misses stars accomplishing the first half of their pms phase , during which we can not therefore conclude anything about the rotational evolution .",
