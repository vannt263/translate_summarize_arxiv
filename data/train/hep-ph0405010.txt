    "the discovery of @xmath6 by the leps collaboration at spring-8 @xcite and the observations of the subsequent experiments have initiated great interests in exotic baryons in hadron physics . because of its positive strangeness , the minimal quark content must be @xmath7 and hence @xmath8 is an exotic pentaquark state .",

    "rigorous theoretical studies were then performed for heavy quark sector , i.e. , pentaquark baryons with one anti - charmed quark or anti - bottom quark . in the pioneering work of lipkin @xcite and grenoble group @xcite , the anti - charmed pentaquark with one strange quark",
    "was shown to have the same binding energy as the @xmath25 dibaryon in the heavy quark mass limit and in the su(3 ) limit .",

    "following the first experimental search for heavy pentaquarks @xcite , the observation of @xmath6 and @xmath26 has brought new interests in this subject @xcite .    in the light quark sector ,",

    "after the discovery of @xmath6 there have been lots of theoretical models and ideas to explain the structure of pentaquark baryons and to search for the other pentaquark states .",

    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the roper resonance @xmath27 should be excluded as a pure antidecuplet state .",
    "this is because , within su(3 ) symmetry , antidecuplet does not couple to decuplet and meson octet , whereas @xmath27 has a large branching ratio into @xmath34 channel .",

    "however , recent study for the ideal mixing between antidecuplet and octet states shows that the ideally mixed state still has vanishing coupling with the @xmath34 channel @xcite , which excludes @xmath33 as a pentaquark state .",

    "most model predictions for those production processes , however , do not consider the intermediate pentaquark baryons in its production mechanisms as the unknown inputs like the electromagnetic and strong couplings of pentaquark baryons are required .",

    "the interaction lagrangian reads @xmath268 which gives @xmath269      the interaction lagrangian reads @xmath270 which gives @xmath271      this interaction contains two types as there are two ways to fully contract the upper and lower indices . as in the case of @xmath272 we define @xmath183- and @xmath49-type interactions as @xmath273 then we have @xmath274 where @xmath275 and @xmath276 here , @xmath277 with @xmath278 and @xmath279 therefore , we have @xmath280      this interaction lagrangian also contains @xmath183- and @xmath49-type and reads @xmath281 where @xmath282 and @xmath283 here , @xmath284 with @xmath285 which leads to @xmath286      the interaction lagrangian of @xmath4 and @xmath3 reads @xmath287 which gives @xmath288      the interaction lagrangian in this case is obtained as @xmath289 which gives @xmath290      other interactions of pentaquarks can be obtained directly from the results in the previous subsections .",
    "namely , the interactions for @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath2-@xmath1 , @xmath3-@xmath1 , and @xmath4-@xmath1 can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ lag:1 - 8 ] ) , ( [ lag:10 - 8 ] ) , ( [ lag:10bar-8 ] ) , and ( [ lag:27 - 8 ] ) by replacing the three - quark octet by pentaquark octet . also the interactions for @xmath4-@xmath2 and @xmath5-@xmath2 can be read from eqs .",
    "( [ lag:27 - 10 ] ) and ( [ lag:35 - 10 ] ) , respectively , by replacing the three - quark decuplet by pentaquark decuplet .",
    "this completes the interactions of pentaquark baryons with pentaquark baryons and meson octet .",
    "in this section , we derive several relations for the mass differences among pentaquark baryons .",
    "this can be obtained by using the gell - mann  okubo mass formula , @xmath291 where @xmath292 is a common mass of a given multiplet and @xmath293 with @xmath294 for the @xmath54 representation . in the tensor representation ,",
    "one can obtain the same results as follows .",
    "since all the particles belonging to an irreducible representation of su(3 ) are degenerate in the su(3 ) symmetry limit , it is required to include su(3 ) symmetry breaking to obtain the mass splittings .",
    "it is well - known that the hamiltonian which breaks su(3 ) symmetry but still preserves the isospin symmetry and hypercharge is proportional to the gell - mann matrix @xmath295 .",
    "thus we introduce the hypercharge tensor as @xmath296 then the baryon masses can be obtained by constructing all possible contractions among irreducible tensors and the hypercharge tensor .",
    "as the mass formulas contain several parameters which take different values depending on the multiplet , we can obtain only the relations between the masses . also note that we do not consider mixing among baryon multiplets in this work .",
    "for the pentaquark octet , the mass term is given by @xmath297 using the particle identifications for the octet tensor , we obtain the octet mass as @xmath298 the particle name in each equation indicates its mass in this section .",
    "one can then easily find that eq .",
    "( [ h8 ] ) leads to the gell - mann  okubo mass relation for the pentaquark octet , @xmath299      in this case , the fully contracted hamiltonian reads @xmath300 working out the contraction , we obtain @xmath301 note that we have the well - known equal spacing for the decuplet spectrum , @xmath302      the mass spectrum of antidecuplet is very similar to that of decuplet , namely , @xmath303 which gives @xmath304 again , we have equal spacing rule in the spectrum @xcite , @xmath305      there are three possible ways to contract upper and lower indices as in the case of octet .",
    "we have @xmath306 the masses are then given by @xmath307 from the above results , we can obtain several mass relations , @xmath308 some interesting relations can be found .",
    "first , one can find the analog of gell - mann ",
    "okubo relation , @xmath309 second , we note that some of the * 27 * -plet members , i.e. , @xmath225 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 , @xmath312 , and @xmath313 , satisfy two independent equal - spacing rules , @xmath314 note that they are the states with maximum isospin for a given hypercharge and the equal - spacing rule holds independently for the upper half of the @xmath4-plet weight diagram and for the lower half of the weight diagram ( fig .  [ fig:27 ] ) .      in this case , we have @xmath315 the obtained masses are @xmath316 here we observe that there are two sets of baryons which satisfy the equal - spacing rule separately .",
    "namely , ( @xmath262 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 , @xmath319 , @xmath320 ) are equally spaced and another equal spacing rule holds for ( @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 ) , @xmath326 one can derive other mass relations such as @xmath327",
    "in summary , we have obtained the flavor wave functions of all pentaquark baryons in su(3 ) quark model including @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "then the su(3 ) symmetric lagrangian for the interactions involving pentaquark baryons is constructed and the mass relations among the pentaquark baryons are derived . together with the mass sum rules , the obtained su(3 ) selection rules and su(3 ) symmetry relations would be useful in searching for the pentaquark baryons in future experiments and studying their production processes as well as developing more sophisticated models for pentaquark structure .",
    "the flavor - spin wave function of pentaquark baryons can be constructed by extending our results to su(6 ) @xcite and the symmetry breaking effects can be introduced to our su(3 ) symmetric lagrangian in a standard way .",
