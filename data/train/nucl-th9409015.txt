    "p. b. burt s work extends to almost all branches of theoretical physics . in the last two decades ,",
    "i have been fortunate to work with him on the application of a nonlinear quantum field theory he developed @xcite to mostly two  nucleon interactions .",
    "his guidance when i was his student in the early 70s and our collaboration afterwards has led to the development of solitary wave exchange two - nucleon potentials ( sweps ) .",
    "i am pleased to present sweps on this occasion .",
    "the most popular phenomenological potentials such as the reid @xcite soft - core and the best obeps such as those developed by bonn@xcite , paris @xcite , and nijmegen @xcite groups are all based on the assumption that exchanged mesons ( bosons ) are described by linear fields . aside from simplicity , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect meson fields to be linear .",
    "it is possible that the exchanged mesons interact with each other and are more realistically described by nonlinear fields .",
    "this possibility has led to the development of solitary wave exchange potentials(sweps ) @xcite , seb90 sweps are derived in the same manner as obeps @xcite .",
    "however , obeps rely on a superposition of linear field propagators that are accompanied with independent masses , coupling constants and form factors .",
    "this approach involves about a dozen parameters . in the derivation of sweps , the linear field theory based propagators are replaced with solitary wave propagators constructed from exact particular solutions  solitary wave solutions  of nonlinear generalizations of the klein ",
    "gordon equation .",
    "the solitary wave propagator exchanges a sequence of masses with a few ( about three ) parameters .",
    "the nonlinear quantum field theory upon which sweps are based is discussed in a monograph by burt @xcite .",
    "sweps exhibit features that are characteristic of well known phenomenological @xcite and one boson exchange @xcite potentials .",
    "e.g. , spin singlet @xmath1 even nn sweps are attractive at intermediate and long ranges @xmath2 and repulsive at short ranges @xmath3 . at long ranges",
    "@xmath4 all the sweps have opep tails .",
    "the nonlinear quantum field theory developed by burt is discussed in his book @xcite .",
    "this section barely serves as an intrduction to help establish the notation used in this paper .",
    "it states the basic nonlinear field equations and the solitary wave solutions relevant to the sweps discussed in this paper .    the field equations for spin  zero meson fields used in connection with sweps are nonlinear generalizations of klein  gordon equation @xcite .",
    "they have the form : @xmath5 where m is the meson mass ( in this proposal the pion mass ) , @xmath6 are self  interaction coupling constants and j is the meson field self - interaction current .",
    "simple examples of eq .",
    "1 are the @xmath0 field theory which leads to @xmath7 and the sine  gordon equation which follows from @xmath8 .",
    "these two examples yield essentially equivalent two ",
    "nucleon potentials @xcite . even though the major goal of this work is to tackle sweps based on generalizations of the @xmath0 and sine  gordon theory @xcite , in this paper , the sine  gordon equation is used to demonstrate that realistic two  nucleon potentials with very few parameters ( only one more than opep ) can be derived from simple nonlinear quantum field theoretical models .",
    "the sine  gordon equation used is : @xmath9 in the @xmath10 , eq .",

    "it plays an important role when proper normalization is considered @xcite . in this paper , @xmath20 is used for simplicity .",

    "gordon solitary wave propagator like other solitary wave propagators is essentially a superposition of feynman propagators and it exchanges a series of meson masses .",
    "the sequence of masses lead to superpositions of attractive as well as repulsive yukawa and exponential potentials in coordinate space .",
    "in lowest order , the nn interaction is conveniently represented by the direct ( a ) and exchange ( b ) feynman diagrams shown in fig .",

    "2(b ) shows the calculated singlet even @xmath57 sg swep phase shifts are in good agreement with corresponding experimental values @xcite .",
    "in addition , the sweps yield reasonable @xmath73 and @xmath74 state wave functions ( fig .",
    "3 ) and low energy deuteron parameters [ table i ] . these results are remarkable considering only the pion is used and only two parameters ( @xmath75 and @xmath33 ) are involved . the @xmath68 state is not affected by the value of the ps - pv coupling mixing parameter@xmath33 .",
    "therefore , it involves only one parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the higher angular momentum states , especially the @xmath71 state , are sensitive to the value of @xmath33 .",

    "it is remarkable that realistic singlet even nn potentials that closely resemble reid soft - core potentials [ fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ] can be derived directly from nonlinear field theoretical models such as the sine  gordon and @xmath0 theories . even though they utilize only one more parameter ( @xmath84 or @xmath75 ) than opep , the sg swep yields high quality phase shifts [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] as well as reasonable deuteron wave functions [ fig .",
    "3 ] and low energy parameters [ table i ] .",
    "these results provide a strong motivation for studying sweps and the nonlinear field theoretical models upon which they are based .",
    "the general aim of this work is to derive and test ( by comparison with experimental @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 data ) a variety of two  nucleon potentials called solitary wave exchange potentials ( sweps ) .",
    "the main virtue of sweps is a strong theoretical foundation that enables them to have less than one third of the parameters used by popular obeps and yet provide a high quality fit to experimental data .",
    "the immediate outcome from sweps is ; simple , realistic , theoretically derived potentials with the least number of adjustable parameters that would yield a full set of high quality nucleon ",
    "nucleon elastic scattering phase shifts as well as low energy deuteron parameters .",
    "the sg swep discussed in this paper does not have a spin ",
    "orbit(@xmath89 ) term .",
    "the significance of the @xmath89 term in triplet @xmath57 states has been long known @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished by incorporating @xmath90 meson , two  pion , and/or scalar meson exchange contribution(s ) .",
    "once the parameters of sweps are determined using nn phase shift and low energy deuteron data , they would be useful in the quantitative study of nuclear ( few and many body ) , astrophysical , and hadronic phenomena .",
    "the derivation and testing of sweps by comparison with low and intermediate energy @xmath57 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 data has the important significance of connecting the nonlinear quantum field theoretical models upon which the sweps are based to experimental data as well as to qcd inspired quark cluster models @xcite .",
    "the primary aim is , however , to determine the numerical values of the parameters ( self interaction coupling constants ) involved and establish the reliability as well as usefulness of nonlinear meson field theory . after being tested at low and intermediate energies , the nonlinear quantum field theories , especially in their properly normalized form @xcite ,",
