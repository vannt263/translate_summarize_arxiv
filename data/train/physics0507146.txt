    "linear regression analysis between the b3lyp/6 - 311++g(d , p ) level calculated and experimental b@xmath1 values have been made for a reasonable prediction of rotational constants of all the other 22 rare isotopomers of clcccn . due to the lack of quantitative data on the ir intensities in the literature , the rotational invariants @xcite of clcccn",
    "have been predicted and discussed here may be helpful in future for the experimental ir spectroscopist in interpreting ir intensities of this molecule .",
    "satisfactory agreements between the calculated and available experimental values of spectroscopic parameters have been found at the b3lyp level and compared with the corresponding values calculated at b3pw91 , rhf and mp@xmath8 levels of theory .",
    "in addition , a test of the optimization followed by a frequency calculation at the mp@xmath8 level in conjunction with a medium size basis set 6 - 31 g or / and 6 - 311++g(d , p ) predicts two negative frequencies ( saddle point of oder two ) corresponding to the -c@xmath9c - cl doubly degenerate bending mode ( @xmath10 ) and thus it was difficult to calculate the harmonic frequencies of these modes under c@xmath11 point group symmetry .",

    "@xmath7the mean atomic charges as well as the other rotational invariants derived from the atomic polar tensors ( apts ) using equations ( 1 ) to ( 5 ) for all the five atoms of the clcccn are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the atomic polar charges @xmath43 represent the redistribution of the electric charge density around each atom in such a way that their sum over all atoms equal to to zero in the molecular bonding environment of clcccn at its optimized equilibrium geometry . an important difference between apt charges and the mullikan charges",
    "@xcite is that the basis - set dependence of the former arises only from the fact that the basis set can be incomplete ; hence , as the basis set approaches completeness , the apt charges approach a well - defined limit @xcite .",
    "a test with clcccn , shown in table 4 , clearly indicates that gapts are almost invariant with respect to the basis sets .",
    "the polar tensor elements are calculated to be all negative for chlorine and nitrogen atoms as expected since these are the electronegative elements , contrast to the carbon atom ( c@xmath44 ) attached to it through a triple bond character which is highly positive , resulting the mean dipole moment of nitrogen as negative and that of carbon as positive , each of which can be interpreted as carrying slightly more than -0.35 e and + 0.35 e. this , in turn , results in an unequal distribution of charges among the two carbon atoms , with some negative charge located on the carbon atom ( @xmath45 ) bonded to @xmath46 and an almost equal amount of positive charge on the other carbon atom @xmath47 , leading to an interpretation that the carbon atoms @xmath45 and @xmath47 carries atomic charges slightly more than + 0.25e and -0.25e respectively .",
    "the average values of atomic polar charges calculated by all the methods are -0.146e , 0.396e , -0.251e , 0.366e and -0.365e having standard deviations @xmath20.013e , @xmath20.001e , @xmath20.0.016e , @xmath20.032e and @xmath20.024e for cl , c , c , c , n of clcccn",
    "respectively which indicates an overestimation of standard deviations of c@xmath44 and n that arises mainly due to p@xmath48 component of the atomic polar tensors of c and n. it is noted worthy that all other invariant quantities are within 0.1e whereas a larger variation in the value of anisotropy parameter @xmath49 as well as in the value of undeformability of charge ( @xmath50 ) on the atom @xmath16 of clcccn ( as shown in table 4 ) has been noticed .",
    "+ @xmath7the mulliken atomic charges , on the other hand , of chlorine and carbon attached each other by means of a single bond are predicted to be positive in conjunction with 6 - 311++g(d , p ) basis set at all the methods , whereas these are predicted to be negative in conjunction with aug - cc - pvnz ( n @xmath12 d , t ) basis sets .",
    "similarly , the charge of carbon atom attached to the nitrogen atom through a triple bond character is predicted to be negative irrespective of the methods and basis sets used .",
    "however , it successfully predicted a real sign to the nitrogen atom as expected .",
    "as can be seen , variations of these charges with respect to all the methods as a function of basis set choice is rather large , variations being -0.208e to 0.51e , -0.898e to 0.101e , 1.155e to 1.985e , -0.387e to -2.154e and -0.117e to 0.454e for cl , c , c , c and n of clcccn respectively , whereas apt charges are less variable ireespective of the methods and basis sets used .",
    "a comparison of apt charges with the mulliken atomic charges indicates that the apt charges are highly reliable than the mulliken atomic charges and the mulliken population analysis of atomic charge densities of clcccn does not reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of this system under consideration .",
    "finally , a comparison of the mulliken atomic charges with the effective charges ( @xmath51 ) , shown in table 4 , reveals an increase of chlorine(cl ) , @xmath47 , @xmath46 and @xmath52 apt charges as @xmath53 diminishes , which leads to an interpretation that @xmath51 is dominated by the stretching intensities @xcite .",
    "all the spectroscopic constants were calculated at the restricted hf - scf as well as dft ( b3lyp , b3pw91 ) levels in conjunction with a variety of basis sets .",
    "satisfactory agreements between the b3lyp/6 - 311++g(d , p ) and experimental values of rotational constants were found for clcccn . over - all , @xmath54 , bond distance is a good approximation to the over - all bond distance at the correlated b3lyp/6 - 311++g(d , p ) level of theory .",
    "the values of chlorine and nitrogen nqccs have been obtained at the b1lyp / tzv(3df,3p ) and b3lyp/6 - 311++g(df , pd ) levels respectively on the r@xmath0 structure as well as on the b3pw91/6 - 311++g(d , p ) optimized geometry are well within the scale length of experimental uncertainty .",
    "enlarging basis sets size could improve the calculation accuracy and satisfactorily reproduced the experimental bending mode frequencies without being scaled with uniform scaling factors , though the stretching frequencies are a bit off .",
    "the rotational invariants have been satisfactorily explained at these levels of theory .",
    "the stationary point found on the potential energy surface of clcccn calculated at the mp@xmath8/6 - 311++g(d , p ) level of theory is not a true minimum rather a saddle point of order two and thus scan of the potential energy surface should be emphasized in oder to determine the nature of the saddle point and verify any possible existence of conical intersection between the ground and first excited state . _",
