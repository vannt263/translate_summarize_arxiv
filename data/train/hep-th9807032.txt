    "the use of the schrdinger picture in field theory provides a natural framework for non - perturbative calculations based on anstze for the vacuum wave functional ( vwf ) .",
    "although the yang - mills vwf has been analyzed numerically by lattice simulations @xcite and analytical approximations @xcite , it is an open problem to compute vevs with such a vwf because we have to address the calculation of non - gaussian path integrals .",
    "one way to systematically compute the path integral @xmath2\\ , |\\psi_0[\\phi]|^2 \\label{vev}\\ ] ] would be to expand @xmath3 $ ] about a gaussian , so we can use wick s theorem to obtain the vev . in principle , this would involve a perturbation expansion with ( dressed ) propagators and an infinite number of non - local vertices with increasing dependence on high momenta . within perturbation theory ,",
    "it can be explicitly shown that these diagrams will not generate new divergences other than the ones which are substracted by renormalization @xcite .",
    "outside perturbation theory we may encounter divergences ( which will have to cancel when we resum the expansion ) due to the fact that the gaussian term ( around which we expand ) does not damp the high momentum modes strongly enough .",
    "we will show how to compute such a path integral by performing a further expansion in terms of local expressions .",
    "therefore , we will give a method to compute finite vevs , from a given @xmath3 $ ] , by expanding the logarithm of @xmath3 $ ] in power of @xmath4 and its derivatives ( and considering the quadratic term in @xmath4 as the unperturbed part ) .",
    "notice that now ( if we compute an equal - time vev ) the @xmath5|^2 $ ] can be interpreted as the exponential of ( minus ) a euclidean local action ( which lives in the quantization surface @xmath6 ) with an infinite number of ( non - renormalizable ) terms which apparently generate ultra - violet divergences .",
    "these arise because the path integral includes configurations with momentum far beyond the convergence radius of our local expansion . in @xcite",
    "we have argued that that ( provided the theory has a mass - gap ) the convergence radius of the local expansion is non - zero and finite .",
    "therefore , we introduce an explicit cut - off , @xmath0 , on the fourier components of the field configurations of eq .",
    "( [ vev ] ) .",
    "now the equal - time vev of an operator can be computed from the @xmath7-local expansion , provided @xmath0 is smaller than the convergence radius . of course",
    ", we want to send @xmath0 to infinity . in @xcite",
    "we have studied the domain of analyticity of the ( equal - time ) vevs as functions of this cut - off and used it to compute the @xmath8 value by analytic continuation . the particular method chosen for the continuation",
    "is not essential , although the procedure should be suitable for numerical analysis .",
    "we found to be most convenient a method related to borel resummation ( which itself is commonly used to re - sum asymptotic series ) .",
    "we will discuss the method in the context of scalar theory in @xmath1 dimensions and we will give an example based on perturbation theory ( where we can check it ) .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for yang - mills theory @xmath9 $ ] , is analytic in the cut @xmath10-plane with the cut in the negative real axis .",
    "the same holds for scalar theory @xcite .",
    "this analyticity of the scaled vwf provides a method to recover the full @xmath3 $ ] from its functional taylor expansion around slowly varying configurations .",
    "this analyticity can be extended to scaled equal - time vevs @xcite , so they can be reconstructed from the resummation of a perturbation expansion ( the expansion parameter will be @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the mass scale which appears in the chosen vwf and which will be related to the energy spectrum)generated by locally expanding the vwf .    for scalar theory in @xmath1 dimensions , we have shown @xcite that @xmath13|\\psi_0 \\rangle_{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{s}}}\\ ] ] is analytic in the cut @xmath10-plane , with the cut going from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( and with @xmath16 being a integer number ) .",
    "we will recover @xmath17 ( which gives an approximation to the vev if @xmath0 is large enough ) by analytic continuation from @xmath18 ( where a local expansion can be used ) to @xmath19 .",
    "the method for the analytic continuation is based on constructing a function , @xmath20 , from @xmath21 : @xmath22 the integration contour @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with the @xmath24 $ ] cut .",
    "= 5.0 cm = 5.0 cm    a local expansion of the vwf will give a series in @xmath25 @xmath26 which has been rearranged in a series in @xmath27 , so the eq.([ilambda ] ) will give @xmath28 it is shown in @xcite ( by collapsing the contour to an infinitesimal circle around @xmath19 and a contribution from the cut , which will be damped by the exponential term ) that the @xmath29 limit of eq.([ilambda ] ) gives the vev : @xmath30 because we expect that the convergence radius of eq.([borel ] ) will be infinite @xcite , we can obtain an approximation for @xmath31 by truncating the ( alternating ) series at @xmath32 terms , and taking @xmath33 as large as is consistent with this . in practice",
    "this means that we take @xmath34 to be a small fraction of the value of the truncated sum .",
    "we have to assume that the function @xmath20 does not have a plateau at finite @xmath33 , which could incorrectly indicate that the @xmath31 limit has been reached ( and therefore the truncated approximant would give the value of @xmath20 at the plateau , instead of @xmath31 ) .",
    "we may instead estimate @xmath31 by looking at the point where the approximant ( a polynomial in @xmath33 ) is stationary , then we have to assume that @xmath20 has no stationary point other than the one at @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we will illustrate how to compute the , equal - time , two - point function in a @xmath1-dimensional scalar theory model where the vwf is given , for slowly varying configurations , by @xmath35 and we assume that this vwf has a sensible uv limit ( high frequency modes for the configurations ) , so the analyticity of the vev ( which was proven in @xcite for the true vacuum ) also would hold here .",
    "we write the ( connected ) two - point function for small momenta as @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be computed by performing a perturbation expansion with a small cut - off @xmath0 .",
    "they will be given by a series in @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we give the result of the computation of @xmath37 and @xmath38 until order @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",

    "the values for the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 and the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] gives for @xmath37 @xmath50 and after resummation @xmath51 to be compared with @xmath52 we need to go to the next order in @xmath0 in order to be able to give a resummed value for @xmath38 . finally , in @xcite we have shown that @xmath53 provided @xmath54 .",
    "we have shown how to compute vevs by using a local expansion of the true vwf within the context of scalar theory in @xmath1 dimensions , where no extra counterterms are needed ( this feature is also shared by yang - mills theory in @xmath55 dimensions ) .",
    "in @xcite we have shown how the analyticity properties of the true vacuum in the cut - off , @xmath0 , can be used to recover the vev from a series in positive powers of @xmath0 ( which is the usual output of a local expansion of the vwf ) . if we want to use a variational ansatz for the vwf , we will have to asssume ( or prove ) that its short distance behaviour is such that the @xmath8 is finite and , furthermore , that the analyticity behaviour of vevs in @xmath0 is preserved ( so we can use the analytic continuation ) .",
    "we have given a diagrammatic approach to compute the first terms of a series in @xmath0 for a vev in the scalar theory , which ( after our resummation ) will give the @xmath8 value of the vev .",
    "we expect that this method can be generalized to yang - mills theories in @xmath55 dimensions where , in the strong coupling limit , we expect to have a local vwf and therefore use the resummation to compute the vev of a large wilson loop .",
