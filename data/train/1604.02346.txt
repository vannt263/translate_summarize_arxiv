    "maldacena s famous ads / cft correspondence @xcite is the best elaborated holographic duality conjecture between gauge and string theories .",
    "the discovery of integrability on both sides of the correspondence @xcite , created a hope to find the exact solution of the theory in the planar limit . the mathematical apparatus offered by integrability , proved to be the most efficient in computing the planar spectrum of anomalous dimensions / string energies . in the large volume limit the spectrum - charge in @xmath7 .",
    "] was described by the asymptotic bethe ansatz ( aba ) equations @xcite which account for all power - like corrections in volume , but neglects the exponentially small wrapping corrections .",
    "the wrapping corrections @xcite were taken into account by the so - called lscher - formulae @xcite which are now available up to the second order in wrapping @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) technique was the first method which could sum up all wrapping corrections to the aba in the form of a set of infinite component nonlinear integral equations @xcite .",
    "though the tba equations could provide important results , both in the weak @xcite and in the strong @xcite coupling regimes , its analytical and numerical treatment proved to be tedious , due to the cumbersome kernels and the infinite number of unknown functions .",
    "later the finlie method @xcite , which can be considered as an improved finite version of the tba , allowed one to reach better results in the perturbative regime @xcite , but the structure of the equations was still so complicated that it required reasonable human effort to reach higher and higher orders in the perturbative regime .",
    "recently the spectral problem of ads / cft ( or equivalently the tba ) was reformulated as a nonlinear riemann - hilbert problem for a few unknown functions .",
    "the new formulation is called the quantum spectral curve ( qsc ) or @xmath8-system @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the qsc method was demonstrated by numerous remarkable analytical and numerical results , the computation of which seemed to be hopeless in the framework of tba .",
    "first of all , qsc made it possible to reach in principle arbitrarily high orders in the perturbative regime . in @xcite",
    "even 10-loop analytical results were obtained for some operators in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "qsc was powerful to get analytical results also in the near - bps regimes @xcite . in @xcite",
    "analytical next - to leading order results were obtained in the small spin expansion for the anomalous dimensions of twist operators in the @xmath0 sector , providing also analytical predictions for the strong coupling expansion coefficients of the anomalous dimensions for some local operators and for the bfkl pomeron intercept . in @xcite",
    "leading order bfkl equation was derived by performing the @xmath9 analytical continuation .",
    "later , in @xcite an efficient numerical algorithm was proposed for solving the @xmath8-system and it was used to confirm 2 previously known and to predict several previously unknown coefficients in the weak coupling expansion of the bfkl pomeron intercept .",
    "recently , analytical expression was obtained for the next - to - next - to leading order of the bfkl pomeron eigenvalue in @xcite , and the qsc description of cusped wilson - lines @xcite and of the quark - anti - quark potential @xcite were worked out .    in this paper",
    "we consider twist-2 operators with even positive integer spin .",
    "using the numerical method of @xcite , we perform the numerical solution of the @xmath8-system for the twist-2 states with @xmath2 in a wide range of the thooft coupling .",
    "though analytical strong coupling results are available in the literature for the anomalous dimensions of the states under consideration , they come from small spin results matched with classical and quasi classical string - theory results @xcite and not directly from the strong coupling solution of the @xmath8-system . this is why the aim of the paper is to gain a deeper insight into the strong coupling behaviour of the solutions of the @xmath8-system .    in the @xmath2 cases ,",
    "our accurate numerical results confirmed the analytical predictions of @xcite for the first 4 coefficients of the strong coupling expansion for @xmath10 . in the case of the konishi operator , due to the high precision of the numerical data",
    ", we could give numerical predictions to the values of two further coefficients .    beyond the numerical investigation of the anomalous dimensions",
    ", we investigated numerically the strong coupling behaviour of the coefficients @xmath3 in the power series representation of the @xmath11-functions . based on our high precision numerical data , in the regime , where the index of the coefficients is much smaller than @xmath5",
    ", we conjectured that the coefficients have polynomial index dependence at strong coupling .",
    "this allowed us to propose a strong coupling series representation for the @xmath11-functions being valid far enough from the real short cut .",
    "to get some insight into the behaviour of @xmath11 close to the real branch cut , we also investigated the qualitative strong coupling behaviour of the @xmath6-functions at the branch points .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 . and 3 .",
    "we recall the @xmath8- and @xmath12-descriptions of the states under consideration and explain , how the free parameters coming from the symmetries of the qsc are fixed .",
    "the next section contains the detailed description of the numerical method together with all necessary technical subtleties which make it possible to implement the numerical code in c++ programming language .",
    "the analysis of the numerical data is presented in sections 5 . and 6 .",
    "the paper is closed by the summary of our results .",
    "some technical details of the numerical method and some tables of numerical data are placed into the appendices of the paper .",
    "in this paper adapting the method of @xcite , we solve numerically the qsc equations for some twist-2 operators in the @xmath0-sector of the theory .",
    "the corresponding operators can be schematically represented as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a complex scalar field of the theory , @xmath15 denotes the light - cone covariant derivative , @xmath16 is the twist , and @xmath17 is the spin of the state . here",
    "we investigate the case when @xmath18 and @xmath17 , the spin of the state , is even .",
    "the reason for this choice is to avoid treating null vectors in the internal linear problems of the numerical method ( see remark at the end of subsection [ 4pont2 ] ) .",
    "so that we could use the high order perturbative results of @xcite as initial values for the numerical iterative algorithm , we parametrized the @xmath6-functions and fixed the symmetries of the @xmath8-system in the same way as it was done in @xcite .",
    "now , we recall the most necessary equations and relations of the qsc framework .",
    "the qsc method @xcite describes the full planar spectrum of @xmath1 by the solutions of a set of nonlinear riemann - hilbert equations .",
    "the fundamental objects of qsc are the eight @xmath19- and @xmath20-functions which separately form a basis on the @xmath21 element of the q - system of @xmath1 . in the @xmath0 sector ,",
    "due to the left - right symmetry of the t - hook , one can describe the whole @xmath22-system by only four @xmath23 or four @xmath24-functions , such that the other four ( upper indexed ) components are simple linear combinations of them : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant matrix :    @xmath27 the @xmath11 and @xmath28 functions are analytic in the spectral parameter @xmath29 with branch cuts .",
    "the positions of the branch points depend on the t hooft coupling : @xmath30 and they may be located at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "all branch points are assumed to be of square root type .",
    "this means that , the result of two subsequent analytical continuations around a branch point is an identity transformation .",
    "the advantage of the choice of @xmath11s or @xmath28s as basis is their very simple discontinuity structure . on the complex @xmath29-plane ,",
    "@xmath11 has a single short cut , while @xmath28 has only a single long cut , such that the discontinuities lie on the real axis .",
    "since the states we study lie in the left - right symmetric @xmath0 sector of the theory , we specify the presentation of the riemann - hilbert equations of the qsc for this sector . for any function @xmath33 , denote @xmath34 the analytical continuation around the branch point @xmath35 and for short @xmath36}(u)$ ] stands for @xmath37 .",
    "then the @xmath8-equations take the form @xcite : @xmath38}_{ab } , \\label{qsc3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "in addition to the previously listed equations and properties , analyticity constraints are also imposed on the possible solutions of ( [ qsc1]-[qsc3 ] ) .",
    "namely , in the qsc formulation of the spectral problem of @xmath52 correspondence , it is postulated @xcite that @xmath11 and @xmath42 have no poles on the first sheet and their absolute value is bounded at the branch points .",
    "the @xmath8-system ( [ qsc1]-[qsc3 ] ) is invariant under the linear redefinitions ( h - symmetry @xcite ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant matrix with @xmath55 . in principle",
    "@xmath54 might have 15 components , but if one would like to preserve the prescriptions ( [ asympt1 ] ) for the large @xmath29 asymptotics , then only 6 non - zero elements remain to be fixed .",
    "these elements can be fixed by fixing the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 and by imposing the value of 4 other coefficients in the large @xmath29 expansion of @xmath47 . in our numerical framework",
    ", we used the h - symmetry fixing conditions of @xcite .",
    "the requirements are as follows :    * @xmath58 and @xmath59 , * @xmath60 has no term proportional to @xmath61 in its large @xmath29 expansion , * @xmath62 has no term proportional to @xmath63 in its large @xmath29 expansion , * @xmath64 has no terms proportional to @xmath63 and @xmath61 in its large @xmath29 expansion .",
    "we used this h - symmetry fixing scheme , so that we could use the high order perturbative results of @xcite as initial values for our numerical iterative algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , since we study left - right symmetric states , also parity symmetries can be imposed on the first sheet . for the twist-2 case",

    "can also be represented by the analytical continuation ( @xmath85 ) of the series ( [ p12 ] ) and ( [ p34 ] ) , but it is not convergent on the entire @xmath29 plane .",
    "its convergence is restricted to a oval domain lying around the real short cut of @xmath47 @xcite .",

    "the concrete numerical solution of qsc @xcite is implemented through the @xmath91-system .",

    "then the @xmath20-functions are defined by the formula : @xmath108 since @xmath105 is upper half plane analytic , the determination of @xmath109 is simple : @xmath110 as a consequence , ( [ qai ] ) can be rephrased as follows : @xmath111 from this equation the leading order large @xmath29 behaviour of @xmath105 can be determined @xcite : @xmath112      the strategy of the numerical method is as follows @xcite .",
    "one starts from the series representations ( [ p12],[p34 ] ) of @xmath11 and the goal is to compute numerically @xmath10 and those coefficients of the series , which are left undetermined after fixing the symmetries of qsc .",
    "then from the representations ( [ p12],[p34 ] ) , @xmath84 can be determined by an @xmath85 transformation .",
    "this representation of @xmath84 is convergent in an oval shaped region containing entirely the branch cut on the real axis .",
    "the next step is to solve the recursion for @xmath105 .",
    "this is done in two steps : first it is solved in the large @xmath29 limit , and then the recurrence relations ( [ qai ] ) are used to pull back the solution to the real axis . then @xmath28 and @xmath109 are constructed from ( [ qidef],[qitilde ] ) .    in order to exploit the @xmath12-equations , one has to determine @xmath95 , as well .",
    "it is computed from @xmath28 and @xmath109 by an integral expression derived from @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( see ( [ omega ] ) later ) .",
    "all the quantities computed so far , are considered as functions of @xmath10 and the unknown coefficients of the series ( [ p12],[p34 ] ) .",
    "this discrete set of variables is determined by imposing the equations ( [ qsc2 ] ) .    in practice",
    "the whole process goes iteratively .",
    "one starts from a `` good '' approximation for the unknown coefficients and @xmath10 , and goes through the steps discussed above . by the solution of ( [ qsc2 ] ) ,",
    "one gets the new initial values for the unknowns and the procedure is repeated until convergent result is obtained .    in the next section",
    "we describe the numerical method in detail , this is why the reader , who is interested in only the numerical results , might skip the next section .",
    "in this section we describe our implementation of the numerical solution of qsc equations .",
    "we try to write down all important details and subtleties , in order to give help to those , who would like to solve numerically qsc equations in a fundamental programming language like c++ or fortran .",
    "the technical details , we are going to write down , help to reduce each step of the numerical method to solving linear equations and to summations .",
    "the numerical implementation of these two simple mathematical problems is quite straightforward in any fundamental programming language .      in the previous section we described the set of unknown coefficients to be determined by the numerical method .",
    "the h - symmetry of the @xmath8-system was partly fixed by fixing the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    ". then @xmath81 and @xmath82 are given by ( [ aa ] ) and they depend on @xmath115 and @xmath10 , provided @xmath16 and @xmath17 are fixed previously .",
    "as we mentioned , this choice of h - symmetry fixing was made to be able to use the perturbative results of @xcite as initial values .",
    "thus , for the twist-2 states with even @xmath17 , in the weak coupling regime , where @xmath116 , we used the six - loop perturbative results of @xcite for the unknowns as initial values for the iterations . according to our experience beyond the radius of convergence of the perturbative series ( i.e. @xmath117 ) , the perturbative results were not good initial values for the iterations anymore . for @xmath118 ,",
    "the numerical method failed to converge if we used the high loop perturbative results of @xcite as initial values . for higher values of the coupling constant @xmath73 ,",
    "the initial values of the unknowns should be made out of the numerical data belonging to smaller values of @xmath73 .",
    "this means that beyond @xmath119 , one should increase @xmath73 in small steps , and the initial values should be determined as appropriate compositions of the previously computed data . in our concrete numerical studies , we increased @xmath73 with @xmath120 and the initial values were given by a 4 , 5 , or 6 order taylor - series composed of the previously computed numerical data .",
    "this construction of initial values is given in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "since the numerical method uses also the @xmath12-system , we have further freedom to fix 2 of the coefficients @xmath100 .",
    "we fixed the values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , then @xmath123 and @xmath124 are completely determined by ( [ bb ] ) . for the sake of simplicity , for small @xmath73 we used the choice : @xmath125 for higher values of @xmath73 , the choice of these coefficients play important role in the convergence of the numerical algorithm .",
    "our experience suggests decreasing their values as @xmath73 is increased .",
    "for example , in case of the konishi operator ( @xmath126 ) the @xmath127 choice was necessary below @xmath128 .",
    "] to reach satisfying convergence in the regime @xmath129 .",
    "so far we explained , how to fix the `` free '' coefficients and how to construct good initial values for the iterative numerical algorithm .",
    "the next step is to choose the discretization points for our functions .",
    "the final equation ( [ qsc2 ] ) is imposed on the short cut of the real axis , this is why we need to give an appropriate discretization of the interval @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "the discretization should be dense enough to be able to compute the integral expressions for @xmath95 with high enough numerical precision .",
    "since all functions in the qsc framework have square root - type behaviour at the branch points , it is plausible to choose the discretization points as zeros of the chebyshev - polynomials .",
    "the reason is that on the interval @xmath131 $ ] the chebyshev - polynomials of the second kind form an orthonormal basis with respect to the square - root type weight function @xmath132 .",
    "a summary on the necessary properties and identities of the chebyshev - polynomials is given in appendix [ appb ] .    in order to be able to use the advantages of formulae ( [ bn ] ) and ( [ us ] ) ,",

    "this allows one to represent @xmath207 as a convergent series with respect to some sequence of orthogonal polynomials .    for practical purposes explained in appendices [ appb ] and [ appc ]",
    ", we choose the chebyshev - polynomials of the second kind @xmath208 as basis for this expansion : @xmath209 as a consequence of the convergence of this series , the coefficients quite fast tend to zero .",
    "thus , @xmath210 can be computed very accurately from the appropriately truncated version of ( [ rho - u ] ) . if the first @xmath133 terms are left from ( [ rho - u ] ) after truncation , than the coefficients can be computed from well known formulae for the chebyshev - polynomials .",
    "first , we introduce the matrix : @xmath211 then we compute the expansion coefficients with respect to the chebyshev - polynomials of the first kind : @xmath212 and finally using the identity ( [ tu ] ) , the coefficients of ( [ rho - u ] ) are given by : @xmath213 using the results of appendix [ appc ] , @xmath95 and @xmath214 can be expressed in terms of the coefficients @xmath215 by the formulae : @xmath216 @xmath217 where @xmath218 denotes @xmath151th chebyshev - polynomial of the first kind , and the expression of @xmath219 entering @xmath198 is also simple in terms of @xmath215 : @xmath220 one can recognize that in ( [ omegaregija ] ) the multiplier of @xmath215 depend on only @xmath73 and the discretization points @xmath221 .",
    "this is why it is useful to compute it at the beginning of the numerical method .",
    "the computation of the quantity : @xmath222 involves an infinite sum .",
    "the numerical method for computing it within a given numerical accuracy , is described in appendix [ appd ] .",
    "the coefficients of ( [ p12],[p34 ] ) and @xmath10 are determined by imposing the equations : @xmath223 instead of solving numerically ( [ final ] ) as an equation , @xcite proposed to solve it as an optimization problem .",
    "this means that one tries to find the numerical solution of ( [ final ] ) by minimizing the quantity : @xmath224 this is performed by the levenberg - marquardt algorithm described in detail in the next subsection .",
    "the minimization of @xmath225 is achieved via the levenberg - marquardt algorithm . to describe it , we put all unknowns into a single vector @xmath226 . in our case",
    "certain unknowns are real     and @xmath60 and @xmath10 are the real ones . ] , while others are pure imaginary     and @xmath64 are the imaginary ones . ] .",
    "the real unknowns are put into the first @xmath227 components of @xmath226 , while the other components are the imaginary ones : @xmath228 @xmath229 if we truncate the sums in ( [ p12 ] ) at @xmath230th term , then the number of real unknowns is @xmath231 .",
    "the reason is that the number of coefficients in the truncated versions of ( [ p12 ] ) is @xmath232 , plus @xmath233 , because @xmath10 is also a real unknown .",
    "if the sums in ( [ p34 ] ) are also truncated at the @xmath230th term , then the number of imaginary components is @xmath234 .",
    "thus , if all infinite sums are truncated at the @xmath230th term , then @xmath226 is a @xmath235 component vector .    for short ,",
    "we introduce the multi - index @xmath236 and denote @xmath237 . in this notation ( [ ss0 ] ) takes the form : @xmath238 and our task is to find the vector @xmath239 , which minimizes @xmath240 .",
    "assuming that @xmath226 is close to @xmath239 , @xmath240 can be linearized around the minimum and the minimization process consists of subsequent iterative minimizations of the linearized approximations of @xmath240 .    to expand ( [ ss1 ] ) around the minimum one needs to compute the derivative matrix : @xmath241 in practice it is done with the help of a second order formula for the first derivative : @xmath242 with @xmath243 being a small number .",
    "thus @xmath244 is numerically approximated by the formula : @xmath245 it is worth to introduce its sign modified conjugate : @xmath246 if @xmath226 is close to the minimum @xmath239 of @xmath240 , then using a linear approximation : @xmath247\\cdot \\left [ { \\cal f}^*_i({\\bf c})-\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^\\lambda \\ , \\tilde{\\cal j}^*_{ik}({\\bf c } ) \\ , ( { \\bf c}_k-\\tilde{\\bf c}_k )   \\right]\\ ] ] and imposing the minimum condition @xmath248 , one gets a set of linear equations for the components of the minimum vector : @xmath249 where @xmath250 @xmath251 in practice , during the iteration , equation ( [ cck ] ) determines the new values of the unknowns from the old ones .",
    "namely , if @xmath252 denotes the value of @xmath226 after the @xmath151th iteration , then its value after the @xmath253st iteration is given by : @xmath254 the iterational prescription ( [ ccit ] ) works very well , if the initial value of @xmath226 is very close to the exact solution . otherwise , it does not define a convergent iteration .",
    "in such cases the levenberg - marquardt ( lm ) modification of ( [ ccit ] ) is needed to decrease the difference @xmath255 at each step of the iteration @xcite , and so to slow down and stabilize the iteration process . in the levenberg - method ,",
    "equation ( [ ccit ] ) is modified by adding a unit - matrix multiplied with an iteration number dependent number to @xmath256 . in case of the marquardt - method the unit - matrix is changed to the diagonal part of @xmath257 : @xmath258 where @xmath259 is an iteration number dependent number .",
    "the main drawback of the levenberg - marquardt modification is that , it defines a quite stable , but very slowly converging algorithm . to find the minimum of @xmath240 within practically acceptable amount of time ,",
    "the term proportional to @xmath30 should be switched off after a few number of iterations . here , we have to mention , another important property of the lm - algorithm , namely the larger the value of @xmath30 , the slower the convergence is .",
    "this is why , it is also desirable to decrease the value of @xmath30 at each step of the iteration .",
    "taking into account the facts and experiences above , we used the lm - algorithm in the following way :    first , we choose a not too large initial value for @xmath260 and a divisor @xmath261 . for the states under consideration we took @xmath262 and @xmath263 . at the @xmath151th step starting from @xmath252",
    ", we go through the whole iteration process with @xmath259 and get the new vector @xmath264 . if @xmath265 , then we decrease the value of @xmath30 by dividing it by @xmath266 , i.e. @xmath267 .",
    "otherwise we increase the value of @xmath30 by multiplying it by @xmath266 : @xmath268 and the new iteration starts from the old initial values i.e. @xmath269 .",
    "after a certain number of such iterations , when @xmath270 becomes small enough ( @xmath271 ) , the action of @xmath30 is switched off and the further iterations are done with the @xmath272 formula ( [ ccit ] ) .",
    "we note that in our concrete numerical computations we used the marquardt - type ( [ lm ] ) modification of ( [ ccit ] ) and in practice we do not compute the inverse of @xmath257 , but solve the following set of linear equations for @xmath264 : @xmath273      in this subsection we write down the process of the numerical algorithm .    * first , initial values are chosen for @xmath274 and @xmath266 .",
    "* going through the process described in the previous subsections , we compute @xmath275 . * to compute the derivative @xmath276",
    ", one does the same computation another @xmath277 times , but starting from the 1-component shifted initial value vectors : @xmath278 , where @xmath279 or @xmath280 depending on the properties of @xmath281 under complex conjugation .",
    "* then the quantities @xmath282 and @xmath283 are computed .",
    "* the corrected values of the unknowns ( i.e. @xmath284 ) are computed by the marquardt - version of ( [ ccit ] ) .",
    "* @xmath285 is computed from @xmath284 . *",
    "the initial values of the next iteration are chosen by the rule : if @xmath286 , then @xmath287 and the next iteration starts from @xmath284 . otherwise @xmath288 and the new iteration starts from the old initial values i.e. @xmath289 .",
    "* the whole process starts from the beginning ... * after several such iterations @xmath30 is set to be zero , and ( [ ccit ] ) determines the new approximations for the unknowns .",
    "the konishi operator is the most studied element of the set of single trace operators in the @xmath290 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "the set of twist-2 operators with even spin also includes it as the @xmath291 special case . in this section",
    "we summarize our numerical results obtained for the konishi operator .",

    "previous numerical investigations @xcite could determine the first few coefficients of the large @xmath73 series of the anomalous dimension @xmath10 .",
    "now , beyond the numerical determination of the coefficients of the strong coupling series of @xmath10 , we also determine the large @xmath73 behaviour of the coefficients of the @xmath78 series in ( [ p12],[p34 ] ) .",
    "we also study the strong coupling behaviour of the @xmath47 functions around the branch points @xmath293 .",

    "d__atain.nb notebook file , where it is also explained , how to get a required quantity out of the huge array of numerical data .",
    "we are interested in the coefficients of the strong coupling expansion of @xmath10 : @xmath296 for the twist - l operators in the @xmath0 sector , there are analytical predictions for the first four coefficients of ( [ deltaki ] ) .",
    "the coefficients depend on @xmath16 and @xmath17 and take the form @xcite : @xmath297 @xmath298 @xmath299 the first two coefficients in ( [ d01 ] ) can be determined either from basso s slope function @xcite or from semi - classical computations in string theory @xcite .",
    "the next two coefficients were determined by matching the @xmath300 term of the small spin expansion with classical and semi - classical results @xcite .",
    "to determine numerically the coefficients in ( [ deltaki ] ) , we computed @xmath10 numerically in the range @xmath301 $ ] range with approximately 20 digits of accuracy and in the range @xmath302 $ ] we fitted the numerical data with a power series of the form of ( [ deltaki ] ) .",
    "the fitting method went as follows .",
    "we fitted a power series of type ( [ deltaki ] ) to the numerical data .",
    "we increased the order of the truncation of the series until the numerical values of the coefficients stabilized .",

    "we experienced that it is very close to the exact value ( [ d01 ] ) .",
    "this is why we assumed that its value is equal to the analytical prediction .",
    "then we subtracted @xmath304 from the numerical data and fitted the new set of data with a truncated power series of type @xmath305 .",
    "again , we increased the order of the truncation of the series until the numerical values of the coefficients stabilized .",
    "then we concentrated on the coefficient @xmath306 .",
    "we experienced that , the fitted value of the coefficient @xmath306 is very close to the analytical prediction given by ( [ d01 ] ) .",
    "again , we assumed that the exact value of @xmath306 is given by ( [ d01 ] ) , and we subtracted also the second term of ( [ deltaki ] ) from the numerical data . then to get @xmath307 , we fitted the new set of data with a series starting at of order @xmath308 etc .",
    "our results for the fitted values of the coefficients of ( [ deltaki ] ) are shown in table [ t1 ] .",
