    "relativistic spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings can cause inspiraling binary compact systems containing neutron stars ( ns ) or black holes ( bh ) , to precess , provided that at least one of the two spins is of significant magnitude and misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "this precession leads to a periodic change of the orbital plane orientation and therefore modify the inspiral gravitational wave ( gw ) signal received by ground - based detectors .",
    "currently binary inspiral searches with interferometric detectors , soon expected to be at optimal sensitivity , such as laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , and geo600  @xcite , rely on sophisticated signal processing techniques to extract the signal from the intrinsic noise of the instruments . for binary compact objects ,",
    "the best available linear filter is the well - known _ matched - filtering _",
    "technique  @xcite . for the maximum possible signal - to - noise ratio ( snr )",
    ", this method requires the best possible _ a priori _ knowledge of gw signal waveforms to be used as templates .",
    "schematically , the basic idea is to search for correlations between the output of the detector and the chosen family of templates .",
    "the maximum snr is achieved when the signal coincides with one of the templates .",
    "if this is not the case , the loss in snr can be measured by the _ fitting factor _",
    "( ff ) , with relates the actual snr to the maximum one by  : [ e : def_ff ]  ( ) = ()_max , as introduced in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite , for more details on ff ) .",
    "this paper represents the continuation of our group s work , previously presented in  @xcite ( hereafter papers i and ii , respectively ) .",
    "this series is devoted to the study of precessing compact binaries and , more precisely to the effects of precession on the detectability of binary inspiral signals .",
    "if precession is not taken into account in the templates , it would cause a loss in snr measured by @xmath0 ( averaged over source orientation ) and consequently a decrease in detection rate by a factor @xmath1 , assuming a homogeneous space distribution of the sources .",
    "it has been shown in papers i and ii as well as in  @xcite that the detection rate could be greatly reduced ( by up to an order of magnitude ) .",
    "it has also been known for some time now that this effect is more important in binaries with high mass ratios  @xcite . therefore in this paper ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems with a typical @xmath2 ns and and a stellar - mass bh of @xmath3 .",
    "let us note however , that according to @xcite , the most probable system to be detected by the first generation of detectors is not of that type , but rather consists of two black holes with mass ratio close to unity .",
    "our current understanding of the physics of the interior of ns suggests that , in a binary system , the ns is not expected to have a spin of significant magnitude  @xcite .",
    "so we will assume that the most massive object , i.e. the bh , will carry all the spin .",
    "for this case where only one object is spinning , apostolatos _",
    "( 1994 - 1995 ) have derived an analytical approximation of the emitted waveform , valid up to 1.5 post - newtonian ( pn ) order : the _ simple precession _ regime @xcite . for simplicity and computational efficiency , we will use this approximation , instead of integrating the full set of 2pn equations describing the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "we will see that the results are very close to the ones obtained by buonanno _",
    "_ using more detailed signals @xcite . as in papers",
    "i and ii we will use the initial ligo noise curve throughout the paper ( values taken from table iv of @xcite ) .    in a realistic data analysis pipeline , it is difficult to implement a search that uses the `` full '' precession waveforms as templates .",
    "indeed such waveforms depend on a large number of parameters , typically ten ( e.g. , magnitude and orientation of the spins , orientation and position of the binary , etc ) , so that the computational burden to compute the cross - correlations with the output of the detector for all the possible values of the parameters is beyond the reach of current resources . to solve this problem",
    ", one can hope to find a family of `` mimic '' templates which depend on formally few parameters , but still leads to high @xmath4 values . following and extending an initial proposal by apostolatos @xcite , we presented , in paper ii , a strategy based on a hierarchical search , where successive corrections are applied to the phase of the templates .",
    "the final correction is the sum of an oscillatory term of the form proposed by @xcite and several spike - like features , hence the name `` spiky '' templates .",
    "apart from the mass ratio , the effect of the precession modulation and hence the @xmath4 also depends on the spin magnitude of the most massive object ( here the bh of @xmath3 ) and the tilt angle of this spin with respect to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "until now none of the studies focused on the detectability of precessing binary inspiral have considered the astrophysical origin of the compact object spin magnitudes and orientations and their expected probability distributions .",
    "clearly these will affect any _ realistic _ probability statement about the detectability of precession - modulated signals must take these into account .",
    "the physical origin of the tilts has been understood uniquely in the context of asymmetric compact object formation and the existence of supernova kicks  @xcite .",
    "our current astrophysical understanding is well developed and allows theoretical predictions for the distribution of tilt angles among different populations of binary compact objects .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution of compact object magnetic field strengths is not as well understood , and therefore reliable probability distributions of spin magnitudes are difficult to calculate and the results are strongly model dependent .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold . in the first part of the paper ( sec .",
    "[ s : spiky ] ) , we examine more realistic precession waveforms ( that include thomas precession ) and we show ( sec .",
    "[ ss : ff_curves ] ) that the results are in excellent agreement with those obtained through numerical integration of equations that describe the orbital dynamics  @xcite . in section  [ ss : help ] we point out our intriguing result that precession can , in some cases , help detection and increase the value of the signal - to - noise ratio . in the second part of the paper ( sec .",
    "[ s : tilts ] ) we introduce , for the first time , the coupling between astrophysical predictions for the probability distributions of tilt angles with ff calculations and we obtain astrophysically relevant results for the detection rate degradation as a function of the compact object spin magnitude .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ s : conclu ] .",
    "in paper ii , we proposed a technique to detect gravitational waves from precessing binaries , based on a three step hierarchical search .",
    "the first step was to just use the standard chirp templates , possibly including 2.5 pn corrections to the phase @xcite .",
    "the second step was originally proposed by apostolatos @xcite and consists of the addition of a three parameter @xmath5 oscillatory term in the phase @xmath6 ( see eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "although this helped , we proposed to improve the efficiency of the procedure by searching for spike - like features ( that we found appear in the residual phase after the two steps ) in the phase as a third correction .",
    "each spike depends on only two ( rather well constrained ) parameters ( the position @xmath7 and the width in frequency space , given by @xmath8 ) plus a boolean parameter ( the sign @xmath9 ) .",
    "more precisely the equation of a given spike is  : [ e : spike ] f > f_0 p(f_0 , , ) & = & [-1 ] + f < f_0 p(f_0 , , ) & = & [-+1 ] .",
    "the spikes are searched one by one until some convergence criterium is achieved .",
    "we refer the reader to paper ii for more details .",
    "the results presented in paper ii were quite encouraging .",
    "however there is a number of points that still need some exploration .",
    "one of them is an important difference between the results presented in paper ii and the ones obtained in parallel and independently by buonanno _",
    "indeed , even though the two proposed schemes are completely different , the effects of precession should be the same , when using the standard ( non - precessing ) chirp signal .",
    "this was not the case : the lower curve of fig .",
    "12 of paper ii shows a fitting factor as low as 0.5 whereas , for the same system , fig .",
    "14 of @xcite exhibits minimum values around 0.7 .",
    "after some investigations , we determined that the main difference was coming from the assumption made in papers i and ii that the thomas precession term in the simple precession formalism ( given by eq .",
    "( 29 ) of @xcite ) is not important and could be ignored .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , this term was believed to be mainly monotonic and well recovered by mismatching the parameters of the templates with respect to the physical ones of the signal .",
    "in contrast as we will see , the addition of the thomas precession term ( using 1.5 pn expressions for @xmath10 ) in the computation of the signal changes significantly the ff values .",
    "along with this main improvement we made a few other modifications . first ,",
    "as already mentioned in paper ii , we have implemented the use of fft techniques to find the maximum ff with respect to the time at coalescence @xmath11 , at the first step of our procedure . by increasing the speed of the code",
    ", this modification enables us to explore a greater part of the parameter space .",
    "for example , contrary to papers i and ii , for which we used mainly newtonian order for both the templates and the non - precessing part of the signal , in this work , we always use the 2.5 pn chirp signal , which depends on the total mass @xmath12 and the chirp mass @xmath13 .",
    "we determined that using 1024 points for the fft algorithm is sufficient to reach an accuracy of the order of @xmath14 in identifying @xmath15 .",
    "we also modify some of the computational parameters involved in setting the templates database .",
    "more precisely , we increased the number of templates for both @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the previous papers",
    ", we determined those numbers by demanding that , in the cases _ without _ precession , the recovered ff would be @xmath18 , which is similar to what is done for the searches with ligo . on the other hand , it is possible that this criterion is not be sufficient for precise comparison with the work by buonanno _",
    "indeed in @xcite , the maximum ff is obtained by using a maximization algorithm and not by setting a grid of templates so that the precision is probably better than the one obtained by imposing @xmath18 without precession . in order to make a meaningful comparison we increased the number of templates for the masses , requiring that the resulting precision of the ff was better than @xmath14 , measured by convergence of the ff when increasing the number of templates ( see paper ii for details ) .",
    "once again , this leads to using too many templates especially compared to real searches .",
    "the new computational parameters for the masses are the following  : the chirp mass ( or the total mass ) parameter is chosen between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) of the signal masses .",
    "those intervals are populated , in logarithmic scale , by @xmath23 templates for the chirp mass and @xmath24 for the total mass .",
    "the last modification is a slight change in the criterion used for ending the search for spikes . in paper",
    "ii we used a relative convergence of the ff .",
    "however , for real searches , it is probably more convenient to adopt a criterion with respect to the snr , given that the ff is not a very useful notion for noisy signals . therefore we end the search for spikes when the snr is modified by less than @xmath25 between two consecutive spike fittings .",
    "let us however note that this value is an important parameter . for real searches , in the presence of noise , preliminary results seem to indicate that it should be carefully chosen in order to avoid high false alarm rate .",
    "the precise effect of noise on the spikes is a subtle subject and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "let us just mention that we have to deal with two competitive effects : on one hand , the smaller @xmath26 , the more spikes we find and so the higher the ff . on the other hand , the smaller the @xmath26",
    "the more spikes are found , even in the presence of only noise , thus leading to a high false - alarm rate .",
    "this , once again , explains that this parameter must be chosen very carefully , given the specific behavior of the instrument noise .",

    "the curves are presented as a function of the cosine if the bh spin - orbit tilt angle : @xmath28 .",

    ", height=302 ]    in figure [ f : ff_spikes ] we show the calculated average @xmath33 values as a function of the cosine of the misalignment angle @xmath34 , which is a conserved quantity , as long as simple precession is used .",

    "the circles and the dotted line denote the @xmath27 obtained by using only the standard templates .",
    "the most striking feature is that the curve is well above the values found in our fig .",
    "12 of paper ii .",
    "we have verified that two factors contribute to that : i ) the use of pn templates instead of newtonian ones ii ) the addition of the thomas precession term , the latter being the more important contribution , roughly by a factor of five .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that adding a term related to precession actually increases the ff , but this seems to be the case . the lower curve of fig .",
    "[ f : ff_spikes ] is now in very good agreement with the one labeled `` spas '' in fig .",
    "14 of @xcite , indicating that the simple precession regime is , indeed , a good approximation .",
    "let us point out that the only significant difference is present for @xmath36 close to unity .",
    "this effect may seem surprising but is easy to understand and has actually little to do with precession . in the simple precession regime ,",
    "when @xmath37 , the signal coincides exactly with the chirp spa signal ( i.e. the modulations @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) of @xcite are zero ) .",
    "so , for values of @xmath36 close to unity ( i.e. , small spin tilt angles ) , with a signal generated via simple precession , the ff should go to unity , as observed in fig .",
    "[ f : ff_spikes ] . however , when using another way of generating the signal , that may not be true .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , the signal is generated by numerically integrating equations for @xmath40 , the spin and the orbital momentum . in the case",

    "the numerical solution coincides with the one used to derive the spa waveform ( see eq .",
    "( 7.11a ) of @xcite for example ) , only up to the given pn order .",
    "higher order terms cause a small difference between the two waveforms , difference sufficient to explain an average ff as low as 0.8 , even for @xmath42 .",
    "all those considerations illustrate the very important fact that the detailed results can depend greatly from the exact formalism used to generate the precessing signal .",
    "although we will restrict ourselves to simple precession in this paper , we plan to conduct a more extensive study of those effects in the future .",
    "figure [ f : ff_spikes ] shows that , for low values of the spin tilt angle ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , @xmath27 is close to 0.9 or higher . with such high values ,",
    "the spikes are not as important in recovering the precession signal ( this is why the solid and dashed curves almost coincide ) .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath36 , the oscillatory correction begins to fail and the addition of the spikes leads to a significant gain , the maximum efficiency of the spikes being around @xmath44 .",
    "after the three steps of the procedure , we are able to obtain fitting factors around 0.9 , for all the possible values of the spin tilt angle . such efficiency is comparable to the one shown by the alternative technique proposed by buonanno",
    "_ ( see the top solid curve of fig . ( 14 ) of @xcite ) .",

    "the conclusion is that there are systems for which the snr with precession is higher than without .",

    "( [ e : def_ff ] ) , where the @xmath64 is given by the norm of the signal , i.e. by @xmath65 ( the optimum choice of scalar product is given by eq . ( 2.3 ) of @xcite ; see also @xcite for details ) .",
    "without precession the ff is 1 so , in order to get systems with higher snr when @xmath57 than when @xmath59 , there must exists some systems for which @xmath66 . in other words , at least for some systems , precession will _ enhance _ the strength of the gravitational wave signal .",
    "this can be physically understood as follows : consider a system which , when entering the frequency band of the detector , is oriented in the worst possible configuration , hence giving the lowest snr possible . in the case",
    "@xmath57 , because of precession , the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the detector is going to change and the system will no longer be in the worst possible orientation , hence will have higher snr that what would be the case without precession .",
    "of course there must also be systems for which the reverse is true , i.e. for which precession decreases the snr .    to be more quantitative ,",
    "we compute @xmath64 with @xmath59 and @xmath57 for a set of 5,000 configurations .",
    "then we isolate the @xmath67 of the systems that are detected in one case or the other , i.e. the systems for which either @xmath68 or @xmath69 . for those systems , fig .",
    "[ f : sn_max ] shows the distribution of the ratio of the two @xmath64 , in logarithmic scale .",
    "as expected , there is roughly half of the configurations for which precession enhances the strength of the signal and half for which it decreases it .",

    "[ f : histo ] is different in the two cases @xmath59 and @xmath57 ( respectively thick black curve and dotted curve ) .",
    "so to conclude with this effect , the `` real '' snrs are modified by precession in two ways  :    * the match between the templates and the signal is no longer perfect .",
    "this is measured by a decrease in ff . *",

    "however , when the spikes are included , the decrease of ff is sufficiently small to be compensated by the enhancement in @xmath64 , causing roughly the same number of systems to be detected than in the case @xmath59 .",
    "however , it is true that for some events the @xmath64 , hence the actual snr , decreases , as it seems to be the case for the systems with very high snrs . to summarize",

    "inspiraling binaries have already been detected in our galaxy and are known as relativistic binary pulsars ( the hulse - taylor systems psr  b1913 + 16 being the prototype  @xcite ) .",
    "all the known double compact objects with coalescence lifetimes shorter than the hubble time consist of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a white dwarf ( their inspiral is relevant to the planned space mission lisa  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless current theoretical understanding of binary compact object formation ( consistent with the binary pulsars ) undoubtedly leads to the prediction for the existence of close binaries with a ns and a bh , and for the majority of models of binary bhs ( e.g.@xcite ; hereafter bkb ) .",
    "their formation is understood as the outcome of many different binary evolutionary sequences all of which involve a long chain of phases of mass and angular momentum transfer between binary components ( the progenitors of the compact objects ) as well as mass and angular momentum losses from the binaries  ( see bkb ) .",
    "of all these evolutionary links there is only one that is believed to be the origin of spin - orbit misalignments , at least for binaries in the galactic field , i.e. not in globular clusters : the asymmetric collapse of massive stars that imparts a randomly oriented recoil velocity ( known as `` kick '' ) to the nascent compact objects , which affects the binary orbital characteristics and depending on its magnitude and direction can cause the orbital plane to tilt from its pre - collapse orientation .",
    "observational evidence in support of ns kicks has accumulated over the past two decades from a variety of sources , most important being the large measured space velocities of pulsars  @xcite .",
    "for a couple of binary pulsar systems ( one of them being the hulse - taylor binary ) , careful timing and polarization pulsar measurements have provided evidence in support of a non - zero tilt angle between the pulsar spin axis and the orbital angular momentum axis .",
    "such misalignments have been theoretically interpreted as the result of asymmetric kicks and have been used to provide quantitative constraints on kick magnitude and orientation  @xcite .",
    "this basic theoretical understanding has already been used in a preliminary study of the tilt angle distributions expected for bh - ns and bh - bh binaries and their general implications for the reduction in detection rate , if non - precessing templates are used in gw inspiral searches ( see kalogera @xcite , hereafter k00 ) . as discussed in k00 in more detail ,",
    "the tilt - angle calculation is possible in part because of two main evolutionary factors :    * the complicated evolutionary history of binary compact objects includes multiple phases of strong tidal interactions and mass - transfer phases .",
    "the spins of the binary components are expected to be aligned with the orbital angular momentum axis just prior to the formation of the second compact object because of the exchanged angular momentum between the stars and the orbit through these tidal interactions .",
    "therefore , even if earlier in the evolution of the binary compact object progenitors spins were misaligned , all momenta axes are expected to be aligned just prior to the second supernova explosion . * in a bh - ns binary the bh is expected to form from the initially more massive star in the binary .",
    "since more massive stars evolve faster , the bh is expected to be formed first and its spin is expected to be aligned with the orbit just prior to the second explosion .",
    "the ns formed in this second explosion is expected to receive a natal kick , which can result in the post - explosion orbital plane being tilted with respect to the pre - explosion orbital plane . given the extremely small cross section of the bh ,",
    "its spin remains unaffected and aligned with the pre - explosion orbital angular momentum , and hence _ misaligned _ with respect to the orbital angular momentum axis of the newly formed double compact object .",
    "k00 developed a basic scheme for the quantitative modeling of the orbital dynamics during an asymmetric explosion and the resultant distributions of orbital - plane tilt angles , under the assumption of _ circular _ pre - supernova orbits .",
    "based on the above considerations these tilt angles are the misalignment angles between the bh spin and the orbital angular momentum axis , right after the formation of the double compact object .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the time - scale for any evolution in the tilt angle due to spin - spin and spin - orbit couplings is much longer than the age of the universe  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the post - explosion tilts are expected to be preserved during the inspiral phase and to be relevant at the very late phases when the gw frequencies enter the detection bands of ground - based interferometers ( @xmath70hz for initial ligo , for example ) .",
    "the results in k00 indicated that bh - ns systems can have significant ( up to @xmath71 of the systems with tilt angles in the range @xmath72 ) tilt angles , whereas heavier bh - bh systems with typically smaller kick magnitudes tend to have very small tilt angles ( more than @xmath73 of the systems with a tilt angle smaller than @xmath74 ) .",
    "apart from the assumption of circular pre - explosion orbits , k00 adopted a number of simplifications : ( i ) tilt distributions were calculated for a few specific sets of pre - explosion binary parameters ( component masses and orbital separations ) without taking into account the probability distributions of pre - explosion binary characteristics , given the prior evolutionary history of the systems ; ( ii ) the tilt distributions were not convolved with detailed calculations of ff and its dependence on tilt angle and spin magnitude . here",
    "we present a more sophisticated analysis that expands the preliminary study in k00 in three major ways : ( i ) we use binary compact object population models that account for the full evolutionary history of binaries from their formation as primordial binaries in the galaxy until double compact objects form ; these population models provide a detailed record of the distribution function of binaries in their parameter space ( 4-dimensional : two masses , orbital semi - major axis , and eccentricity ) just prior to the second explosion that introduces the bh spin tilt ; ( ii ) we expand the mathematical derivation of k00 to account for the general case of eccentric binaries ; ( iii ) we convolve our astrophysical predictions for tilt angle distributions with our results for the ff values as a function of spin tilt and magnitude .",
    "this allows us to derive astrophysically `` weighted '' ff as a function of spin magnitude and examine the systematics of our results for different population models .",
    "although many of the details of binary evolution are not well understood , the current general understanding ( based both on theoretical stellar evolution calculations and comparisons with a very wide range of different binary types ) is quantitative enough to allow the statistical modeling of binary populations and the calculation of probability distributions of all physical parameters of interest . for a wide variety of scientific problems , such _ population synthesis _",
    "calculations have been used for more than 20 years now , especially in the area of binaries with compact objects  @xcite .",
    "most commonly monte carlo methods are used to generate a large number ( @xmath75 ) of primordial binaries with physical properties that follow certain distribution functions .",
    "the evolution of each binary is independent of the other ( since in the galactic field the interaction time is longer than the age of the milky way ) and is modeled through long sequences of evolutionary phases , until the end of the binary s lifetime . throughout the calculation the binary characteristics are calculated self - consistently .",
    "the overall normalization of the models is fixed by observational constraints on the supernovae and the star formation rates of the galaxy .    for our calculations we use the code",

    "the code , results , and comparisons with earlier work by other groups have been described extensively in bkb , so we will not repeat the astrophysical description here .",
    "we further note that in the past year the population synthesis code has been modified with special focus on the treatment of mass - transfer phases : a new , computationally efficient scheme has been developed that , for the first time allows the calculation of mass - transfer rates and binary evolution through mass - transfer phases that have been carefully tested against results of detailed stellar evolution codes and are in very good agreement  @xcite . using this updated code",
    "we have studied the properties of double compact objects using a subset of the set of models considered by bkb .",
    "we find that the results from the updated version are qualitatively identical to the early models ( presented in detail in bkb ) and , in terms of the tilt - angle distributions , quantitatively similar but with noticeable differences ( typically the new models have a somewhat larger fraction of binaries formed with tilt angles in excess of @xmath76 ) .    in what follows we consider the results from two models already presented in bkb : the standard model a and the model e1 ( with @xmath77 ) .",
    "these have been selected because they provide the widest variations in results in terms of tilt - angle distribution functions .",
    "the details of the physical parameters in each model and the reasons for their choice are described in detail in bkb .",
    "we avoid the repetition here , since , as we will see , the astrophysical motivation and details are not important for the results and conclusions from this study .",
    "however we do describe here the calculation of the tilt angles for _ eccentric _ pre - explosion orbits , since the derivation does not appear anywhere else in the literature .",

    "in general it is evident that it is very difficult to tilt the orbital plane by large angles .",
    "it can be shown mathematically that the tilt angle increases as the magnitude of the kick velocity component perpendicular to the pre - explosion orbital plane ( * @xmath101 * ) increases too .",
