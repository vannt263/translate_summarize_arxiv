    "walking technicolor models have been introduced to overcome the phenomenological difficulties faced by the early technicolor formulations @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "these models exhibit an approximate scale invariance over a wide energy range as well as a proximity to an infrared fixed point , where the gauge coupling is slowly running , or walking .",
    "asymptotically free gauge theories can be utilized to mimic these properties , where it is expected that qcd with a large number of chiral fermion flavours is a viable candidate .    by linking the green functions of a quantum field theory the dyson - schwinger framework offers an appropriate non - perturbative tool to explore a given theory over all energies ranging from the deep infrared to the perturbative regime .",
    "since dses constitute an infinite set of coupled integral equations carefully chosen truncations have to be applied in order to treat the equations numerically .",
    "therefore , a comparison with other non - perturbative methods is inevitable at some point in order to fine - tune the truncation and to minimize errors induced by it .",
    "once an appropriate truncation scheme is established the dyson - schwinger framework is a reliable and robust tool to explore the theory .",
    "r0.55   +    the central object in the following investigation is the quark propagator dse depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : quark_dse ] .",
    "intimately connected is the dressed gluon propagator indicated by the wiggly line . by increasing the fermion flavours , back - coupling effects of quark degrees of freedom on the yang - mills sector become important and simple model descriptions of the gluon propagator without detailed knowledge of its flavour dependence will prove to be insufficient .",
    "in particular , a naive extrapolation of qcd results to larger flavour numbers as done in ref .  @xcite seems to be questionable .",
    "thus , a self - consistent incorporation of the corresponding gluon dse becomes mandatory . in the following we outline the coupled system of dses and refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for details on the self - consistent treatment .",
    "the renormalized dse for the quark propagator is given by @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the renormalization constants for the quark wave function and the quark - gluon vertex , respectively .",
    "the colour trace yields a factor of @xmath4 and the gluon momentum is defined via @xmath5 .",
    "the full quark propagator is given by @xmath6 , where the dressing functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 implicitly depend on the renormalization scale @xmath9 .",
    "the quark mass function is defined via @xmath10 and is a renormalization scale independent quantity .",
    "the gluon propagator @xmath11 is included self - consistently by solving the corresponding dses for the yang - mills system , where we employ the truncation scheme proposed in refs .",
    "unquenching effects enter the gluon dse via the quark - loop diagram as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon_dse ] .        one obtains a closed system if the quark - gluon vertex and the three - gluon vertex is specified . as shown later in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the phase transition is quite insensitive to details of the three - gluon vertex and the main impact seems to come from different tensor structures immanent in the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "although this object was at the focus of recent investigations @xcite , it is up to now still too ambitious to include it in a full self - consistent way due to its complicated multi - tensor structure . in order to proceed we defer this desirable but also highly demanding task to future work and model the quark - gluon vertex according to ref .",
    "the formal structure of the gluon dse is given by @xmath12 where the gluon self - energy contribution stemming from the quark - loop reads @xmath13.\\ ] ] we note that in general a truncated dse system is plagued by spurious divergencies appearing in the kernels of the loop integrals . based on a uv analysis a save way to remove these unwanted contributions",
    "is to modify the integral kernels by constructing appropriate compensation terms , _ cf .",
    ".  @xcite . for moderate flavour numbers the quark loop diagram is ir sub - leading .",
    "hence , a direct modification of the corresponding integral kernels is possible .",
    "however as soon as the system approaches @xmath14 the quark loop becomes ir enhanced and shows similar ir scaling as the ghost loop .",
    "hence , subtracting quadratic divergencies directly from the quark loop fails if one wants to probe the chiral phase transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite we give several complementary methods which are able to eliminate these artificial contributions in a safe way and which are also used throughout .",
    "we present results obtained from a self - consistent treatment of the dse system on the propagator level . for the three - point functions models",
    "are employed , where we emphasize the important role of the quark - gluon vertex tensor structure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1bcxg2_results_mass ] above @xmath15 dynamical mass is no longer generated and the systems enters a chirally symmetric phase . increasing the effective quark - gluon interaction strength using models which include _ only _ the tree - level vertex structure @xmath16 has virtually no impact on the location of the phase transition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qgv_parameter_dependence2 ] .",
    "we furthermore note that different models for the gauge - boson vertex @xcite tend to influence @xmath14 only slightly as detailed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3gv_influence2 ] . on the other hand , including _",
    "additional _ tensor structure in the quark - gluon vertex increases @xmath14 considerably .",
    "thus , a detailed knowledge of the quark - gluon vertex is crucial in order to give reliable predictions for @xmath14 .",
    "+   +    the phase transition manifests itself also in a drastic change of the propagators . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1bcxg2_results ] we present results for the non - perturbative running coupling @xmath17 , the ghost dressing function @xmath18 , the gluon propagator @xmath19 and the inverse vector self - energy @xmath20 for different flavour values @xmath21 . by increasing @xmath22",
    "the coupling is lowered where at @xmath23 this lowering is significant and finally at @xmath14 a sudden drop occurs and a plateau is formed which develops over a wide momentum range . if @xmath22 is further increased the plateau is successively lowered .",
    "thus , within the chirally symmetric phase a scaling relation between the yang - mills propagators is established , _",
    "i.e. _ these objects develop a power law behaviour in this momentum region as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1bcxg2_results_ghost ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:1bcxg2_results_gluon ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1bcxg2_results_a ] , the quark wave - function renormalization is constant in this region as expected from an ir analysis .     +   +",
    "we presented results from an exploratory study of large @xmath22 qcd using the dyson - schwinger framework in landau gauge .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of the corresponding dses on the propagator level reveals a transition to a chirally symmetric phase for @xmath24 .",
    "the non - perturbative running coupling develops a plateau in this regime , where , correspondingly , the propagators follow a power law indicating conformal behaviour .",
    "the critical fermion flavour number is sensitive to details of the quark - gluon vertex model , whereas the gauge - boson vertex seems to play a minor role .",
    "this emphasizes the need for a more complete calculation using a full quark - gluon vertex in upcoming studies .",
