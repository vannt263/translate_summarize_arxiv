    "this is an example of a class of problems , the so - called @xmath11-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian problems , which have arisen in recent years in a number of physical contexts @xcite .",
    "d. bessis conjectured in 1995 that :    eigenvalues of @xmath6 are all real and positive .    many numerical and asymptotic results @xcite support this conjecture .",
    "and later for @xmath12 it was conjectured that the equation ( [ eigen ] ) also has positive real eigenvalues , under different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "however , there is no rigorous proof of this to date .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sector ] , we prove that eigenvalues of the equation ( [ eigen ] ) lie in the sector @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite , it is known that the @xmath11-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath33 has discrete spectrum , for @xmath18 real , and these eigenvalues are positive real if @xmath18 is small enough . however , there are some @xmath11-symmetric hamiltonians that have no eigenvalues @xcite , or non - real eigenvalues ( * ? ?",
    "* footnote on page 26 ) .",
    "lastly , for any @xmath34 there are two linearly independent solutions of ( [ eigen ] ) , if the boundary conditions are not imposed . in generic cases ,",
    "the solutions blow up at both @xmath35 and @xmath36 , while in exceptional cases , the solutions decay to zero as @xmath37 approaches @xmath38 or @xmath36 . only in very exceptional cases ( when @xmath4 is an eigenvalue ! ) does one find a solution that decays to zero at both @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see lemma [ asymp ] for details ) .",
    "in this section , we prove that the eigenvalues @xmath4 of ( [ eigen ] ) lie in the sector @xmath5 and we extend this result for more general cases . to do this we will use results of hille @xcite .    for any @xmath34 the equation ( [ eigen ] ) without the boundary conditions allows two linearly independent solutions . if @xmath39 solves the ode ( [ eigen ] ) , then since @xmath40 is an entire function ( analytic in the whole complex plane ) , there exists an entire function @xmath41 which agrees with @xmath39 on the real line and satisfies @xmath42 u(z ) = \\lambda u(z ) $ ] .",
    "we begin by describing the asymptotic behavior of @xmath7 near infinity .",

    "also we denote @xmath49 for @xmath50    notice @xmath51 is neither @xmath52 nor @xmath53 .",
    "thus the negative and the positive real axes lie within two of the stokes regions ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we call these the _ left- _ and the _ right - hand _ stokes regions , respectively",
    ". also we call the rays @xmath54 `` critical rays '' .    ; the solid line is the real axis and the dotted rays are the critical rays , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . ]",
    "[ asymp ] every solution of @xmath57 u(z ) = \\lambda u(z)$ ] is asymptotic to @xmath58\\ ] ] as @xmath59 in @xmath60 , for each @xmath61 the error @xmath62 is uniform in @xmath63 in the sense that @xmath64 .",
    "also @xmath7 has infinitely many zeros in @xmath65 but only finitely many in @xmath66 for each @xmath67 .",
    "the asymptotic expressions imply in particular that in each stokes region , @xmath41 either decays to 0 or blows up , as @xmath68 approaches infinity in @xmath60 .",
    "see hille s",
    "book @xcite for a proof of a more general result .",
    "an outline of the proof is as follows : hille first transforms the equation into another complex @xmath69-plane by using the liouville transform .",
    "and then he compares @xmath7 with the solutions of the sine equation @xmath70 and finally transforms back to the original complex @xmath68-plane .",
    "so the above asymptotic expressions are the asymptotic expressions for solutions of the sine equation ( in the @xmath69-variable ) expressed in terms of the original @xmath68-variable .",
    "the stokes regions are determined by the liouville transformation .",
    "also we can deduce the last assertion of the theorem from @xcite .",
    "this is proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5 ) for more general equations .    under the liouville transformation , a neighborhood of infinity in each stokes region in the complex @xmath68-plane maps to a neighborhood of infinity in either the upper or lower half @xmath69-plane .",
    "so if @xmath7 decays in a stokes region @xmath71 for some @xmath48 , then @xmath7 must blow up in the stokes regions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "otherwise , there would be a solution of the sine equation in the @xmath69-plane which decays to zero in all directions .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "however , @xmath7 might blow up in many consecutive stokes regions ( even in all stokes regions ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ eigen - defn ] let @xmath34 and let @xmath74 be an analytic function on @xmath65 that satisfies ( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "we say @xmath7 is an _ eigenfunction _ and @xmath4 is an _ eigenvalue _ , for ( [ eigen ] ) , if @xmath41 decays to zero along rays to infinity in the left- and right - hand stokes regions ( that is , if @xmath7 has decaying asymptotics in ( [ asymp - formula ] ) , in these two regions ) .",
    "[ simple ] given a stokes region @xmath75 , there always exists a solution of @xmath76 u(z ) = \\lambda u(z)$ ] that blows up in @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "so if there were two linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue , then all the solutions of @xmath77 u(z ) = \\lambda u(z)$ ] would satisfy @xmath78 and there would be no solutions that blow up in the left- and right - hand stokes regions .",
    "thus there are no repeated eigenvalues , and all eigenvalues are simple .",
    "[ conjugate ] note that if @xmath41 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath4 , then @xmath79 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath80 ( an upper bar denotes the complex conjugate ) .",
    "so if an eigenvalue is real then @xmath81 by remark [ simple ] , and clearly @xmath82 .",
    "writing @xmath83 and replacing @xmath7 by @xmath84 , we get that eigenfunctions with real eigenvalues are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis .",
    "the main result of this paper is :    [ sector - theorem ] if @xmath4 is an eigenvalue of ( [ eigen ] ) , then @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "that the eigenvalues have positive real part was known already @xcite ( according to mezincescu @xcite ) ; our proof below includes a very simple argument for this fact . in the proof and elsewhere , we will use the following :    since @xmath41 decays exponentially along rays to infinity in the left- and right - hand stokes regions , so does @xmath87 by the cauchy integral formula .",
    "therefore @xmath88 and @xmath89 are integrable along the line @xmath90 in @xmath65 for any polynomial @xmath91 , provided @xmath92 ( so that the ends of the line stay in the left- and right - hand stokes regions ) .",

    "taking the real part of ( [ integral1 ] ) gives ( since @xmath107 ) @xmath108    @xmath109 = \\sigma_{k=0}^{n } a_k r^{2k } \\cos(2n-2k+1)\\theta \\geq 0 $ ] if @xmath95 and @xmath110 ( certainly true if @xmath111 ) .",
    "so from ( [ integral2 ] ) we conclude that @xmath112 for all @xmath105 .",
    "that is , @xmath113 for all @xmath114    taking @xmath115 gives @xmath116 , in particular @xmath85 and taking @xmath117 gives @xmath118 then finally using @xmath119 , we have @xmath120 that is , @xmath121    [ general ]    we can extend theorem [ sector - theorem ] by allowing @xmath14 to have some negative coefficients as long as @xmath14 satisfies @xmath109 \\geq 0 $ ] for @xmath105 .",
