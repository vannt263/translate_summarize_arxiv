    "it is well known that despite the perturbative nonrenormalizability of general relativity , it is possible to compute gravitational quantum corrections with no assumptions other than those of effective theory  @xcite .",
    "however , it is also known that power - counting non - renormalizable theories may in some cases lead to quantum theories which are finite in the uv through non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "one well understood case is the gross - neveu model in @xmath1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "there is a growing amount of evidence that gravity is another theory featuring non - perturbative renormalizability or asymptotic safety  @xcite .",
    "the existence of fixed points in higher dimensional gravity @xcite , and their preservation upon coupling to matter @xcite , suggest that extra dimensional models with brane confined matter might also feature asymptotic safety . in this paper",
    "we will implement a framework for computing one - loop observables in the asymptotic safety scenario and compare with previous approaches from effective field theory .",
    "this follows a series of papers looking at calculable and measurable effects of asymptotically safe gravity in models with large extra dimensions  @xcite , for example at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "recent one - loop computations for the back reaction of gravity on the running of the gauge coupling have devoted a sizeable effort to the issue of gauge dependency in the final result  @xcite .",
    "similarly , calculations for precision observables in low scale gravity / brane models have produced some debate on gauge fixing  @xcite .",
    "it was found that at the amplitude level these calculations produce a prohibitively large ir enhancement .",
    "these effects are gauge dependent and must disappear when calculated in proper observables  @xcite . since the graviton couples universally and ubiquitously , the set of one - loop observables must be carefully quantified .",
    "however , our interest is not in the ir spectrum of gravity , and thus we will follow ref .",
    "@xcite and work exclusively in the dedonder gauge where ir divergences are omitted from the outset . the physical interpretation of this gauge is that brane fluctuations decouple from the gravitational theory entirely and may be studied independently  @xcite . using the dedonder gauge",
    "we will compute corrections to the gauge boson propagators and find , as expected , that these are sensitive to the cutoff in both the momentum integral and kaluza - klein ( kk ) summation . at this point",
    "we will implement asymptotic safety in an attempt to quantify possible effects occurring at and above this scale .",
    "it was argued previously that in extra dimensional models the physical scale identified with the renormalization group scale @xmath2 should be the ( @xmath3)-dimensional momentum of a kk graviton  @xcite . for the case of asymptotic safety",
    "this leads to finite , cut - off independent tree - level scattering amplitudes .",
    "we will demonstrate through explicit computation that one - loop corrections to gauge boson self energies are also finite in this set - up .",
    "most importantly this means that we have no need to apply an explicit uv cutoff .    with a finite calculation for a",
    "well defined observable in our possession , we would like to explore two questions .",
    "first , how does the full computation in asymptotic safety compare with an effective theory approach .",
    "it is not clear _ a priori _ which will lead to stronger constraints as there are two competing effects . in effective theory",
    "the kk integral is cut - off separately in the kk mass @xmath4 and the graviton 4-momentum @xmath5 , and thus ( after an analytic continuation ) may include modes with @xmath6 .",
    "the region outside this circle is suppressed by uv effects in our framework . on the other hand , modes with @xmath7",
    "are not included in the effective theory computation , while these modes will contribute in our computation albeit with the uv suppression provided by asymptotic safety .",
    "the results may then also be compared with constraints on extra dimensions from collider  @xcite , astrophysical  @xcite , and precision tests of gravity  @xcite .",
    "second , we would like to have some sense of the ratio of uv to ir contributions as a function of the number of extra dimensions .",
    "we know that tree - level amplitudes can become uv dominated for @xmath8 and more extra dimensions  @xcite . in this paper we will show that at one - loop uv domination may begin at lower dimensions .",
    "our task in this section is , starting from the conventional picture of large extra dimensions , to compute the self energy amplitudes using standard perturbative techniques , and thus reduce the general tensor integral into a closed set of scalar integrals .",
    "we will restrict the brane dimension to strictly ( @xmath9 ) , we will not use dimensional regularization .",
    "thus , we consider a gravitational theory in ( @xmath3 ) space - time dimensions with the coupling to matter @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fundamental scale of gravity .",
    "the normalization factor matches the notation of ref .  @xcite . for a realistic model",
    "we require some mechanism which generates the observed planck mass and generically this will involve a volume factor @xmath12 of the extra dimensions .",
    "thus , in the case of a torus compactification we have the for observed 4-dimensional gravitational coupling @xmath13 .",
    "the utility of these conventions is that the integral and kk sum associated with each graviton loop is @xmath14 which is merely a loop integral over the ( @xmath3)-dimensional momentum .",
    "the sum is shorthand for the individual sums over the kk occupation numbers .",
    "later , we will need the 4-dimensional brane projection of @xmath15 , which we denote as @xmath2 .",
    "the gauge fixing and kk reduction is standard  @xcite . on the brane we have simply kk gravitons and kk scalars in the spectrum ,",
    "minimally coupled to the standard model . in the kk reduction ,",
    "one also in general obtains kk vector fields , which do not couple to matter fields at this order in the expansion .",
    "the graviton and scalar propagators are required for our computations and are derived by inverting the kinetic terms of the einstein - hilbert action . in the classical regime we expect the scalar part for both to be @xmath16 , but at high energies we anticipate different behavior .",
    "the vertices coupling the scalar and graviton to the brane confined sm can be obtained by expanding the metric in the massive gauge boson action @xmath17 the sum is over the discrete momenta in the theory . implicitly in this step we have assumed a compact space and enforced periodic conditions .",
    "the ellipses stand for terms , in addition to higher order in @xmath18 , from the vector kk modes and brane fluctuations ( branons ) which do not contribute in our computations  @xcite .",
    "we start with the seagull diagram , @xmath19 in agreement with the amplitude for a massless gauge boson . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the external momentum , @xmath15 is the bulk loop momentum , and @xmath21 the scalar part of the graviton propagator .",
    "furthermore , the gravi - scalar contribution in four dimensions is proportional to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and thus can only couple to the mass term",
    ". however we find in the metric expansion that there is no term of order @xmath22 and thus the only contribution from extra dimensions is eq.([eq : seagull ] ) .",
    "we will not simplify the loop integral at this point .",
    "the rainbow diagram is @xmath23 where @xmath24 contains additionally terms proportional to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the exact form is given in the appendix [ append ] .",
    "we have also introduced @xmath2 , the brane only component of the full loop momentum . at this point",
    "we could introduce feynman parameters and perform a cut - off or dimensional regularization .",
    "we expect that the leading uv divergences would cancel with similar terms from the seagull diagram .",
    "however , the amplitude would retain power and logarithmic sensitivity to the cut - off scale @xcite . in both cases",
    "the amplitude is uv sensitive , and the effects of quantum gravity are explicitly cut - off .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the fixed point scaling which we will employ leads to a finite amplitude .",
    "therefore , we will tensor reduce this amplitude without making specific reference to the regulator .",
    "additionally , the amplitude in eq.([eq : rainbow ] ) can be reduced to scalar integrals without any knowledge of the higher dimensional theory . using lorentz invariance on the brane",
    ", we project the tensor integral onto the scalar integrals @xmath27 the notation is meant to evoke the similarity to the normal basis integrals obtained in passarino - veltman reduction  @xcite .",
    "the seagull contribution simply reads @xmath28 while the rainbow self energy in terms of the basis integrals is @xmath29 + \\eta^{\\mu\\nu } m_v^4    \\left [ 10+\\frac{n } { 2+n } \\right ] \\tilde{b}_0   \\right ) .",
    "\\label{raintot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be noted that we have not taken into account brane fluctuations , coupling proportional to the brane tension @xmath30 .",
    "it is not clear how one would incorporate this parameter within the framework of asymptotic safety .",
    "moreover , we are physically justified to neglect this contribution if we restrict ourselves to rigid branes or more precisely the energy hierarchy described in ref .",
    "quantum corrections to a massless propagator can be simply accounted for by the wave function renormalization @xmath31 . in particular , we define the renormalization group improved scalar propagator @xmath32 for a massless graviton .",
    "the specific form of @xmath33 encodes , in general in a non - perturbative way , the quantum effects in the theory . for practical purposes",
    "we may only calculate the fixed point behavior of @xmath34 in certain approximations , with a truncated action or at fixed order in perturbation theory . for this study",
    "we will use three approximations for @xmath33 motivated by asymptotic safety .",
    "first , we define the linear  @xcite @xmath35^{-1 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] and quadratic approximation @xmath36 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the numerical value of @xmath37 is numerically related to @xmath38 , the fixed point value of the dimensionless coupling , which itself carries gauge and cut - off dependency .",
    "therefore , for our purposes @xmath37 is treated as input although related to the fundamental scale @xmath11 by a parameter of @xmath39 . the factor two in eq.([quadnew ] ) is convenient when matching with the one - loop perturbative result @xcite , and thus is left explicit rather than being absorbed into the scale @xmath37 .    as opposed to the quenched approximation  @xcite @xmath40         \\dfrac{1}{q^2 }   \\ ; \\dfrac{\\mtrans^{2+n } } { |q|^{2+n } }          &   q^2 > \\mtrans^2         \\end{array }     \\right . \\ ; ,     \\label{eq : gprop}\\ ] ] the graviton propagator in ( [ linear ] ) and ( [ quadnew ] ) does not contain additional poles and thus has only the simple poles corresponding to the classical propagator .",
    "these modified propagators falls off with sufficient power suppression for large values of @xmath41 , so the contour integral can be wick rotated as usual .",
    "finally , we note that recent studies indicate that the running of the gauge couplings induced by the gravitational coupling vanish once a consistent regulator is chosen which respects the appropriate symmetries @xcite . therefore , while the graviton propagator is strongly altered above @xmath37 , we assume that the gauge boson propagator remains classical",
    ".      we can heuristically show the finiteness of our calculation in the asymptotic safety framework .",
    "we apply both the quadratic ( [ quadnew ] ) and quenched ( [ eq : gprop ] ) approximations to account for the large anomalous dimension in the uv .",
    "first of all , we consider the uv portion of the seagull integral in eq.([eq : seagull ] ) , assuming the wave - function renormalization in the the quenched approximation eq.([eq : gprop ] ) .",
    "the momentum integral is then trivial @xmath42 for the rainbow diagram we first write the brane momenta as the 4-dimensional projection of the ( @xmath43)-dimensional momentum @xmath44 .",
    "we will only display an explicit form of @xmath45 at a later point , since it is not required for showing uv finiteness .",
    "considering small values of the external momenta , the leading divergence is @xmath46 once we properly perform the tensor reduction the seagull and rainbow diagrams acquire pre - factors @xmath47 with opposite signs , and the sum of eq.([eq : seaquench ] ) and eq.([eq : rainquench ] ) becomes independent of @xmath48 and hence finite .",
    "it is instructive as well to consider the same integrals for the quadratic approximation . for the seagull",
    "we find @xmath49 we obtain the term in @xmath48 by expanding eq.([eq : seaquad ] ) and find the same leading logarithmic dependence on @xmath48 as in the quenched case .",
    "the rainbow we evaluate using the techniques described above , and when summed with eq.([eq : seaquad ] ) the result is again finite . had either of these computations provided sub - leading divergences of any type , we would not have a sufficiently regulated theory , so the fact that the only divergences are logarithmic serves as evidence of finiteness at one - loop .",
    "we have not mentioned terms in the amplitude proportional to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 . by power",
    "counting the later can not produce a divergence , while the former can at worst admit a term proportional to @xmath50 and not @xmath51 .",
    "this can be seen by examining the momentum structure of the vertices .",
    "these terms are individually finite in asymptotically safe gravity .",
    "the lack of sensitivity to @xmath48 in the self energy amplitude is of course only valid for the dedonder gauge and will not be true for any other choice .",
    "however , also in a less appropriate gauge any physical observable must be independent of @xmath48 . to emphasize this point we outline the related computation in unitary gauge .",
    "the amplitude for the seagull diagram is @xmath52 with a similar , albeit lengthy , expression for the rainbow .",
    "there are no higher uv divergences since upon substitution as described in the following sections the additional terms are proportional only to the ratio of the angular parts , with no @xmath15 dependence",
    ". however , the cancellation of the additional logarithmic terms must also be checked . for genuine physical observables , such as",
    "the one presented later in section  [ sec : res ] , this cancellation does indeed take place and the result is finite .      to illustrate the geometrical picture of our loop integral we consider the same integral with a ( euclidean ) 2 dimensional brane and a single extra dimension . in momentum space",
    "we can easily picture the integral over brane and bulk momenta as a three dimensional integral in terms of spherical polar coordinates . for a rainbow like diagram we have @xmath53 where we denote the 2-dimensional brane analogy of the full momentum by @xmath54 .",
    "the spherical coordinates we orient such that @xmath20 is located at @xmath55 and the dot product occurs between the brane projection @xmath56 with the brane external momentum @xmath20 .",
    "this integral is evaluated numerically , or in this simple case analytically over the angular coordinates .",
    "the full result in ( @xmath57 ) dimensions is merely a higher dimensional generalization of eq.([eq : twoplusone ] ) .",
    "having established the finiteness of our computation in both the quenched and quadratic approximation , we can numerically evaluate the rainbow and seagull diagrams .",
    "it is clear at this point that we would like to perform the ( @xmath57)-dimensional momentum integral over a radial coordinate @xmath58 , but the loop momentum in the gauge boson propagator depends on only the brane projection of @xmath58 .",
    "thus our integral in ( @xmath57 ) dimensions must retain some angular dependence as the bulk and brane momentum are not interchangeable in the rainbow diagram .",
    "a straightforward solution is to define a ( @xmath57 ) dimensional euclidean vector @xmath59 in polar coordinates . treating the brane momentum as the last entries in this ( @xmath57)-vector allows us to make the variable change @xmath60 which in turn requires the projection @xmath61 where the last step is simply a shorthand notation .",
    "the physical interpretation of the angular variables should be clear as they measure the @xmath62-dimensional projection of @xmath15 .",
    "the configuration with all @xmath63 corresponds to momenta confined to the brane , and the corresponding integral is the conventional 4-dimensional case .",
    "this simplifies our loop integrals and is easily evaluated numerically . under the coordinate change the measure in our ( @xmath57)-dimensional loop integration should be replaced as @xmath64 the pre - factor @xmath65 in front is the result of integrating over the 2-additional brane angular coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath67 which our amplitude does not depend on . for the angular measure related to @xmath45 we write @xmath68 , so",
    "the basis integrals from eq.([eq : scalarint ] ) with the renormalization group improved scalar propagator in eq.([eq : renorm ] ) become @xmath69 } \\int dq\\ , q^{n+1 } z^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 using these basis integrals we can numerically compute the gauge bosons self energies in eq.([eq : seagull ] ) and eq.([raintot ] ) .",
    "the sum of the two integrals does not depend on @xmath48 . in the next section",
    "we will see how this method of computing the kk integral compares with an effective theory analysis .",
    "in order to constrain new physics based on precision measurements it is typical to use either the oblique parameter set @xmath73  @xcite or the @xmath74 parameterization  @xcite .",
    "however , the former is not a good parameter set for gravitons , which in general will modify more than just gauge boson self - energies .",
    "the later can be related to the weak mixing angle @xmath75 to define the leading corrections @xmath76 quantifying the violation of custodial symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the individual observables @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the context of gravity require additional computations beyond the self - energies , but the specific linear combination @xmath79 has to be smaller than roughly @xmath80 , assuming a light standard model higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "the exact central value depends on the higgs mass , but the uncertainty of @xmath81 also ranges around @xmath80 , which makes this value a generic upper bound on new physics effects .",
    "the effective theory result for gravity contributions  @xcite in our notation reads @xmath82 for @xmath83 . here , @xmath84 is the effective theory cut - off scale . in figure",
    "[ fig : res ] we compare this result to our computation as described in the previous section .",
    "the numerical results are similar for @xmath85 , where fundamental planck masses below @xmath86  tev are forbidden . in asymptotically safe gravity",
    "the limits are significantly weakened when we increase the number of extra dimensions , which is not the case for the effective theory computation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eft ] ) . in other words , once we take the higher dimensional quantum effects seriously there are essentially no limits on large extra dimensions with @xmath87 from electroweak precision data .    the explanation for this discrepancy is the following : in effective theory , the amplitudes are dominated by modes with both @xmath2 and @xmath88 near the cut - off , in the corner of a square in the @xmath2 vs @xmath88 plane . however , in our picture of asymptotic safety with @xmath89 this region is outside the central circle which means it is suppressed . for higher numbers of extra dimensions this effect",

    "numerically , figure  [ fig : res2 ] shows that the exact results follow the pattern delineated in eq.([eq : simpint ] ) .",
    "the uv region becomes the dominant contribution already for @xmath105 extra dimensions .",
    "this can be contrasted with the case of lhc tree level graviton exchange , where in an identical limit the uv graviton contribution becomes dominant for @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising though as the momentum integral in the tree - level exchange is over four less directions in momentum space , and thus we see the rough equivalence of the @xmath107 case in tree - level with the @xmath108 case at one - loop .",

    "asymptotic safety is particularly useful because it provides measurable predictions for the lhc  @xcite or , as we have shown in the work , for electroweak precision measurements .",
    "we first introduced a method for evaluating gravitational loop integrals in extra - dimensions . defining these in terms of the full ( @xmath3)-dimensional momentum provided a straight - forward regularization scheme . similar to the usual passarino - veltman reduction into scalar one - loop integrals",
    ", we defined and numerically evaluated a set of basis integrals which can be used for a wide class of observables . in this paper",
    "we studied gravitational effects on custodial symmetry in the standard model , the @xmath0 parameter or @xmath81 .",
    "we find that the bounds from electroweak precision data based on asymptotic safety are roughly equivalent to the direct / indirect bounds obtained by previous methods for @xmath96 extra dimensions . for higher numbers of extra dimensions the bounds from virtual gravitons",
    "are irrelevant compared with more direct measurements . compared to an effective field theory ( or cut - off ) prescription our limits are weaker for more than two extra dimensions",
    "this is consistent with the general observation that for larger numbers of extra dimensions the relative contribution from the trans - planckian ( and hence strongly suppressed ) regime become more and more dominant .",
