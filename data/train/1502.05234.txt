    "the study of particle and heat current fluctuations in quantum systems away from equilibrium attracts much attention both from the theoretical and experimental point of view .",

    "it is known @xcite-@xcite however that current fluctuations carry also useful information , providing the experimental basis of noise spectroscopy . the recent progress @xcite of measurement techniques indicates the great importance of this spectroscopy for gaining a deeper insight in the mechanism of non - equilibrium quantum transport at the microscopic level . the latest confirmation of this fact comes from the observation of neutral modes @xcite and spin noise @xcite in fractional quantum hall edge states via noise spectroscopy . at the theoretical side ,",
    "the derivation of exact results beyond the linear response approximation is fundamental in this context , because the current fluctuations are dominated by non - linear effects .",

    "the interaction between the leads is localized in the junction and is described by a @xmath3 unitary scattering matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the system is away from equilibrium if the two leads communicate via non - vanishing transmission ( off - diagonal ) elements of @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that the physical situation , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is nicely described by a landauer - bttiker ( lb ) non - equilibrium steady state @xmath5 , constructed from the data @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that for scale invariant ( critical ) @xmath4-matrices the one - point expectation values of the particle and energy currents in the state @xmath5 can be computed in exact and explicit form , which fully takes into account all non - linear effects and reveals the presence of an interesting process of transmutation between heat and chemical potential energy . here",
    "we pursue further our analysis , deriving the exact two - point current expectation values , which allow to determine the particle and heat current fluctuations in the state @xmath5 beyond the linear response approximation . in order to test the framework",
    ", we first reproduce and generalize some results concerning the particle noise .",
    "in particular , we show that this noise depends not only on the parameter @xmath7 , but also on @xmath8 . the dependence on @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 has been analyzed in the pioneering works of martin and landauer @xcite and bttiker @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a peculiar property of this case is the linear dependence on @xmath12 of the particle current flowing in the junction . in order to investigate the impact of the non - linear effects in @xmath12",

    "compared to the case @xmath15 , we observe a relevant noise enhancement for @xmath16 and reduction for @xmath17 .",
    "an universal upper bound on the particle noise away from the scale invariant regime is also established . following the main steps of our particle noise analysis",
    ", we derive and study in detail the less investigated heat noise as well .",
    "both fermions and bosons are considered and the influence of the statistics ( in particular , of the exclusion principle ) is discussed .",
    "we show that the fermionic noise is a concave function of the transmission probability in the junction , whereas the bosonic one is convex .",
    "this difference provides a new interesting signature for noise spectroscopy .",
    "another remarkable manifestation of the statistics concerns the strength of the noise power .",
    "we show that for the same heat bath parameters in the sate @xmath5 , the bosonic noise always exceeds the fermionic one . a generalization of the framework and results to junctions with @xmath18 leads is also presented . in this case",
