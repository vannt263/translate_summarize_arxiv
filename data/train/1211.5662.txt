    "supersymmetry ( susy ) has been considered to be the strongest candidate of the physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "although the recent data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has not shown any evidence for susy but discovered a standard model higgs - like particle with a mass of around 125 gev @xcite , it still remains a strong candidate of bsm because it suggests the gauge coupling unification , it guarantees proton stability sufficiently , and it provides a reasonable dark matter candidate .",
    "moreover , in string theories , which are the most powerful candidates of the quantum theory of gravity , it plays a crucial role for consistency and must be broken at a scale between the electroweak scale and the planck scale .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate susy - breaking models in the light of lhc data @xcite .",
    "r - symmetry , which is a specific symmetry of supersymmetric models , is a key ingredient for susy breaking and its application to model building .",
    "recent drastic progresses on susy breaking by exploiting a metastable state ( see @xcite for reviews and references therein ) gives us a better understanding of the role of the r - symmetry in realistic model building @xcite .",
    "nelson - seiberg s argument @xcite beautifully demonstrates a connection between metastability and r - symmetry in the context of generalized wess - zumino models with a generic superpotential .",
    "if r - symmetry is preserved , there is no susy vacuum in a finite distance in field space . on the other hand ,",
    "if a gaugino mass has majorana mass , r - symmetry has to be broken to generate the gaugino mass .",
    "thus , there is a tension between stability of vacuum and generating gaugino mass .",
    "a simple solution to this problem is to introduce an approximate r - symmetry .",
    "one of the interesting ways to break r - symmetry is spontaneous breaking . in ref .",
    "@xcite , d. shih revealed a quite fascinating condition for spontaneous r - symmetry breaking in the context of generalized oraifeartaigh models : for r - symmetry breaking , there must be a field with r - charge different from @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "such models were applied to gauge mediation @xcite and some classes of the models successfully generated large gaugino masses . according to the general argument by komargodski and shih @xcite , large gaugino mass",
    "is related to a tachyonic direction at a point in pseudo moduli space toward the messenger direction . in the r - symmetric model ,",
    "such tachyonic direction exists at the origin of the pseudo moduli space .",
    "when the spontaneous breaking of @xmath3 symmetry occurs , cosmic r - strings are formed by the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite . plugging the structure of the pseudo - moduli space mentioned above and r - string forming",
    ", we will meet a quite dangerous possibility .",
    "it is known as a `` roll - over '' process of vacuum through inhomogeneous energy distribution by an impurity such as a cosmic string @xcite . in the core of the r - string ,",
    "the system can easily slide down to the lower vacuum via the tachyonic direction at the origin and form a sort of `` r - tube '' in which the core sits in the lower energy vacuum .",
    "thus , if the tube is unstable , by rapid expansion of the radius , the universe can be filled by the unwanted susy vacuum . as discussed in ref",
    "@xcite this gives a constrain for model building .",
    "however , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , when a @xmath4-term contribution is not negligible , it can lift the tachyonic direction and stabilize the pseudo - moduli space . in such models ,",
    "the roll - over process does not occur .",
    "also , when the amplitude of ( tachyonic ) messenger mass at the origin is sufficiently smaller than that of r - symmetry breaking field , the vacuum selection is successfully realized .",
    "as we will see , r - strings are unstable due to the explicit r - symmetry breaking term in the superpotential and hence the roll - over process can be circumvented if the life - time due to the explicit r - symmetry breaking is shorter than that for the roll - over process . in this paper , we assume such an early stage scenario and study general cosmological constraints for the models . in this sense , the results shown in the present paper is complementary to the ones studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in spontaneous r - symmetry breaking models",
    ", there exists a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , called r - axion , as well as the modulus field called r - saxion .",
    "they are copiously produced in the early universe from scattering of thermal plasma , coherent oscillation , r - string decay and so on , and may cause other cosmological problems . note that although we commented on the importance of r - strings , there are many other sources of r - axions and we should take into account all the contributions at the same time .",
    "model parameters on spontaneous r - symmetry breaking model can be constrained from such cosmological considerations .",
    "note that , unlike the qcd - axion , r - axions receive relatively heavy mass from gravitational coupling with explicit r - symmetry breaking constant term in the superpotential and its lifetime can be much shorter than the cosmic age .",
    "thus , we can impose not only constraints from the r - axion overclosure problem but also that from r - axion decay . in this paper ,",
    "we investigate their cosmological constraints focusing on relatively long - lived parameter range .",
    "we show that the model parameter space is severely constrained and many parameter space of r - axion is ruled out from the cosmological consideration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we explain the general feature of spontaneous r - symmetry breaking models . in section [ sec3 ] , we evaluate the r - axion abundance produced in the early universe . here",
    "we assume that cosmic r - string is produced in some earlier epoch .",
    "we list the cosmological effects induced by r - axions in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we also evaluate the constraint on the parameter space from these effects .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "in spontaneous r - symmetry breaking models , the susy - breaking field with a finite r - charge acquires nonvanishing vacuum expectation value .",
    "the phase of the susy - breaking field is almost massless and identified as the nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "it acquires a small mass from explicit r - symmetry breaking term in the superpotential and called r - axions . in order to see its cosmological consequeces",
    ", we should first investigate their properties and interactions . here",
    ", we review a simple but general r - symmetry breaking model focusing on r - axions and read off their interactions with several modes .      let us consider a simple effective superpotential for the r - charged susy - breaking field , @xmath5 , integrating out the messenger fields , @xmath6 here @xmath7 gives the nonvanishing @xmath8-term for the susy - breaking field and r - symmetry breaking constant @xmath9 is introduced for the cosmological constant to vanish .",
    "note that from the flat universe condition , they are related as @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the reduced planck mass . assuming a noncanonical khler potential , @xmath5 can be destabilized at the origin @xcite .",
    "here we consider the effective potential for @xmath5 , @xmath12 where we have defined @xmath13 .",
    "the second term that breaks @xmath3 symmetry comes from the r - symmetry breaking constant term in the superpotential that couples to @xmath5 field through the planck suppressed interaction in supergravity and decay constant @xmath14 and hence the result does not depend on the detail of the messenger sector or the moduli sector up to numerical factors . ] .",
    "the r - axion mass is related to the parameters in the potential as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gravitino mass .",
    "let us investigate the model further .",
    "we here expand @xmath5 around @xmath17 as follows , @xmath18 so that the fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 have canonical kinetic terms . here the phase part @xmath19 and the radius part @xmath20 are identified as r - axion and r - saxion , respectively .",
    "note that the mass of r - saxion is related to the r - symmetry breaking scale as @xmath21 in the last equality , we assumed that the khler metric is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 being a numerical constant of order of the unity , and @xmath24 is related to the model parameters as @xmath25 .",
    "the fermionic partner of @xmath5 field , `` r - axino , '' is the goldstino for the susy - breaking and absorbed in the gravitino .",
    "thus , we just have to consider cosmology of gravitinos instead of r - axinos .",
    "we now investigate interactions of the r - axion with several modes as well as its cross sections and decay rates .",
    "as we will see , they are useful for the cosmological constraints on r - axion abundance .",
    "first of all , the r - axion to r - saxion interaction can be read off from the kinetic term of @xmath5 , @xmath26 from this interaction , we can evaluate the decay rate of r - saxion to 2 r - axions as @xmath27    we can assign r - charges to the supersymmetric standard model fields such that the r - symmetry is consistent with all of the interactions .",
    "after susy and r - symmetry are broken , the r - axion appears in the gaugino mass terms as well as the so - called b - term and a - terms .",
    "in addition , the r - axion couplings with the gauge bosons appear through the anomaly coupling terms .",
    "that is , the coupling between the r - axion and the photon is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the field strength tensor of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the anomaly coefficient , _",
    "i.e. _ tr  @xmath32 , which is model - dependent .",
    "then , the decay width of the r - axion into two photons is given by @xmath33    similarly , the r - axion coupling with the gluon is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the su(3 ) field strength tensor and @xmath36 is the anomaly coefficient , _",
    "i.e. _ tr  @xmath37 .",
    "this interaction is effective in thermal production of r - axions .",
    "the anomaly coefficients are typically numerical factors of the order of the unity .",
    "it slightly changes our result but basic features do not change according to the choice of the coefficients . in the following , we assume @xmath38 unless we explicitly note .",
    "the interactions of the r - axion with the higgs fields appear through the b - term .",
    "then , the r - axion and the higgs fields mix each other in their mass terms ( see for its detail appendix [ app : higgs - sector ] . ) .",
    "the eigenstate corresponding to the low - energy r - axion @xmath39 includes the axial parts of the up and down - sector higgs fields , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 gev , @xmath45 . note that @xmath19 denotes the r - axion at high energy beyond the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "since the coefficients of @xmath46 are very small , it is found that @xmath47 .",
    "hereafter , we denote the low - energy r - axion by @xmath19 instead of @xmath39 .",
    "however , because of this mixing , the r - axion can couple with the quarks and leptons through their yukawa couplings .",
    "that is , the couplings of the r - axion with the up - type quarks , the down - type quarks and the charged leptons , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , are given by @xmath51 respectively , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 are their yukawa couplings and masses .",
    "through these couplings , the r - axion can decay to a pair of the sm fermions , if @xmath55 .",
    "its decay width is given by @xmath56 for example , the decay rate into the electron pair is given by @xmath57 the decay rate into the @xmath58 pair is enhanced by its mass as @xmath59 , but such a decay occurs for @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , we can compute the couplings between the r - axion and the neutrinos .",
    "for the neutrinos , we consider the weinberg operator in the superpotential , @xmath61 , instead of the yukawa couplings terms .",
    "then , similar to the above , the coupling of the r - axion with neutrinos is given by @xmath62 thus , the decay rate of the r - axion into the neutrino pair is suppressed because it is proportional to the neutrino mass squared , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 therefore , the branching ratio of r - axions into pair of neutrinos are small enough even in the case where the decay channel into electron is closed , @xmath64 mev .",
    "note that r - axion decay associated with qcd jet production occurs when it is heavier than at least the proton mass , @xmath65 gev , which is beyond our interest .",
    "thus , we do not consider it here .",
    "the lifetime of r - axions is given by @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] , we show its @xmath67 dependence with each choice of @xmath68 and @xmath69 gev .    .",
    "black , blue , green and red lines correspond to @xmath70gev , @xmath71gev , @xmath72gev , and @xmath69gev , respectively . here",
    "we use @xmath73 . _ ]    we can see that the lifetime of r - axions becomes longer for smaller @xmath67 and larger @xmath14 .",
    "we can also see that the decay channels to electrons opens at @xmath74 mev and to muons at @xmath75 mev and the r - axion lifetime becomes shorter .",
    "let us consider the cosmology of the spontaneous r - symmetry breaking model focusing on the r - axion production and evaluate the r - axion abundance .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath3 is restored due to some additional mass terms such as the hubble induced mass or thermal mass in the early universe at the origin is larger than that of messenger fields , the susy - breaking vacuum is naturally selected .",
    "however , this issue is beyond the scope of this study and hence we do not impose any constraints on the model parameters from the vacuum selection . ] . after some epoch , @xmath5 field",
    "is destabilized as the additional mass term decreases and acquires vacuum expectation value @xmath76 .",
    "since the approximate @xmath3 symmetry breaks spontaneously at that time , ( unstable ) cosmic strings are formed by the kibble - zurek mechanism .",
    "the long cosmic strings in a hubble volume intersect each other and generates closed string loops .",
    "these closed string loops shrink with emitting r - axions . as a consequence ,",
    "the cosmic string network enters the scaling regime .",
    "as the hubble parameter decreases , the explicitly r - symmetry breaking term in the potential becomes no longer irrelevant to the dynamics of the system and the string network turns to the string - wall system where domain walls are attached to cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "the string - wall networks are unstable and annihilate when the domain wall tension becomes comparable to that of cosmic strings .",
    "the energy stored in the string - wall system turns to r - axion particles .",
    "the fate of r - axions produced from the cosmic string loops and the string - wall system as well as the scattering of thermal plasma and the vacuum misalignment is determined by the lifetime of r - axions , which , then , constrain the model parameters of spontaneous r - symmetry breaking models , the abundance of such r - axions are generally subdominant and hence we do not consider it here . ] . in the following , we estimate the r - axion abundance from each source .",
    "we will examine the cosmological constraints in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .",
    "first we evaluate the energy density of the coherent oscillation of the r - axion field @xcite .",
    "after the spontaneous r - symmetry breaking phase transition , the r - axion field acquires some initial value , @xmath77 , and keeps its position after a while due to large hubble friction . when the hubble parameter decreases to the r - axion mass , @xmath78 the r - axion field starts to oscillate . here",
    "the subscription `` osc '' indicates that the parameter or variable is evaluated at the onset of the r - axion oscillation .",
    "the energy density of the oscillating r - axion @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 if the r - symmetry is broken after inflation , the initial value of r - axion distributes randomly from @xmath81 to @xmath82 since the correlation length of r - axion becomes much shorter than the hubble length at the onset of the r - axion oscillation .",
    "therefore , we estimate the mean value of @xmath77 as @xmath83    since the energy density of r - axion oscillation decreases as @xmath84 , the quantity @xmath85 is conserved as long as there are no entropy production , where @xmath20 is the entropy density .",
    "therefore , we characterize the axion abundance by this quantity as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are ( effective ) relativistic degrees of freedom for energy density and entropy , respectively , and the subscript `` @xmath89 '' represents that the parameter or variable is evaluated at reheating .",
    "note that @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 here we assume that the scale factor increases like matter dominated era during inflaton oscillation dominated era and take into account the dilution until the inflaton decay or reheating when @xmath92 .",
    "next we evaluate the energy density of r - axions radiated from the cosmic string loops @xcite following the discussion in appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite . when the r - string network enters the scaling regime , the energy density of the long r - strings are estimated as @xmath93 here the scaling parameter @xmath94 @xcite represents the mean number of strings in a hubble volume and @xmath95 represents the core width of r - string .",
    "note that the line energy density or the tension of r - string is given by @xcite @xmath96 assuming all the energy loss of long r - strings is converted into r - axion particles through the string loops , we obtain the evolution equations @xmath97 where the energy emission rate from the string loops , @xmath98 here we assume that r - axion particles released from cosmic string loops are relativistic . since the mean comoving momentum of radiated r - axion can be evaluated as @xmath99 with the constant @xmath100 @xcite , we can estimate the number density of radiated r - axions as @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the time when the r - string network enters the scaling regime .    when the hubble parameter becomes comparable to the r - axion mass and r - symmetry",

    "[ sec2 ] . for the point of view of vacuum selection and r - string stability @xcite , this requires unacceptably small messenger mass .",
    "therefore , we conclude that an ingenious model building is necessary for r - axions to be dark matter of the present universe .",
    "thus far , we did not take into account constraints from r - axinos or gravitinos .",
    "gravitinos are produced from gluino scattering in thermal plasma and their abundance is evaluated as @xcite , @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the gaugino mass . since gravitinos are stable in this case , gravitino abundance is constrained from dark matter abundance ( eq . ) . as a result ,",
    "depending on the gaugino mass , another stringent constraint is imposed for model parameters in higher reheating temperature case @xmath201 gev : smaller @xmath14 and @xmath67 would be forbidden .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that spontaneous r - symmetry breaking models are severely constrained from cosmological considerations and generally long - lived r - axions are forbidden . in order to avoid that , careful model building and smaller reheating temperature are required .",
    "we have studied general cosmological constraints on spontaneous r - symmetry breaking models .",
    "we estimated the abundance of r - axion produced firstly via their dynamics such as coherent oscillation and decay of cosmic string / wall system , and secondly via thermal scattering process from gluon - axion interaction .",
    "it is interesting that r - axion production from r - string and wall systems are large enough and can be dominant in some parameter region .",
    "basically the models were motivated by gauge mediation , gravitino as well as r - axion are relatively light . therefore , r - axion tends to be long - lived .",
    "the conditions for the r - axion density coming from bbn , x - ray/@xmath150-ray background , reionization and overclosure severely constrain the scale of r - symmetry breaking . as a result , smaller r - symmetry breaking scale and susy - breaking scale are disfavored from cosmological constraints . in the point of view of gauge mediation",
    ", this result weakens its motivation , but is consistent with the recent lhc results with 125 gev higgs - like boson and without susy particles @xcite",
    ".    it would be interesting to study further constraints for r - axion with relatively large mass . when the r - axion mass is larger than @xmath133 gev , various decay channels to hadronic particle open .",
    "we expect that weaker but non - negligible constraints for large decay constant will be imposed , thought analysis would become involved .    a phenomenologically viable model with long - lived r - axions can be constructed by introducing a mechanism diluting the r - axion density in the early universe . although our primary interest was gauge mediation models , it would be easy to apply our analysis the closely related situations such as spontaneous r - symmetry breaking in thermal inflation models @xcite .    in this paper , we have not explicitly shown a mechanism of vacuum selection of false vacuum .",
    "existence of the r - string and walls are highly depend on the scenario of the early stage of universe .",
    "also , as mentioned in the introduction , imhomogenious vacuum decay by impurities such as a cosmic string depends on the details of the scenario @xcite .",
    "so it may be useful to show an explicit example of full scenario and study r - axion cosmology in detail .",

    "@xcite . here , we concentrate on the neutral components , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , of the higgs sector in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the r - axion appears through the so - called b - term .",
    "then , the relevant terms in their scalar potential are given by @xmath204 where @xmath58 is the supersymmetric mass , originated from the @xmath58 term , @xmath205 and @xmath206 are soft susy breaking masses squared for @xmath207 and @xmath208 , and @xmath209 is the susy breaking b - term .",
    "the b - term has an r - charge , and the axion appears there .    at the potential minimum ,",
    "the higgs fields develop their vacuum expectation values and the electroweak symmetry is broken . around the vacuum ,",
    "we decompose the neutral higgs fields as @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 are vevs of @xmath213 and @xmath203 .",
    "we denote @xmath214 , which is related to the @xmath215-boson mass @xmath216 as @xmath217 ( gev)@xmath218 . also we denote their ratio as @xmath219 furthermore , the stationary conditions , @xmath220 at @xmath221 and @xmath222 , lead to the following relations : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    \\nonumber \\\\    using them , the mixing mass matrix of the axial parts , @xmath46 and the r - axion is given by @xmath224 then , the mass eigenstates are given by @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath39 denote the would - be nambu - goldstone boson and low - energy r - axion , respectively .",
    "here we estimate the r - axion abundance from the r - saxion decay and show that it is smaller than those from r - axion dynamics .",
    "since we have assumed that the r - symmetry is restored in the early universe , there should be homogeneous r - saxion oscillation associated with the spontaneous breaking of r - symmetry .",
    "it can take place when the hubble parameter becomes smaller than the saxion mass . here",
    "we assume that the r - symmetry is broken at @xmath227 .",
    "if r - saxions receive thermal mass , the hubble parameter at the time of phase transition becomes lower , but it requires large reheating temperature and we do not consider it here .",
    "the energy density of r - saxion is given by @xmath228 where the subscript `` so '' indicates that the parameter or variable is evaluated at the onset of r - saxion oscillation .",
    "the energy density of r - saxion oscillation decreases as @xmath229 due to the hubble expansion , and gradually r - saxion decays into r - axions at @xmath230 . here",
    "the subscript `` sd '' represents the parameter or variable is evaluated at r - saxion decay .",
    "the number density of r - axions from saxion decay , then , is evaluated as @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the entropy density .",
    "such r - axions are relativistic at r - saxion decay and loose their energy due to the cosmic expansion . after some time",
    ", they become nonrelativistic .",
    "the energy - to - entropy ratio , @xmath233 , is fixed at that time ( if reheating is completed . )",
    "therefore , we can estimate the abundance of r - axions from r - saxion decay as @xmath234 with @xmath235 . here",
    "we neglected the interaction of r - axion and assumed that the number of r - axions in a comoving volume is conserved .",
    "we can easily show that the abundance of r - axions from r - saxion decay is always smaller than that from r - string and r - string - wall system .",
    "note that if the phase transition is driven by thermal potential , r - axion abundance from r - saxion decay is larger than that is estimated above .",
    "however , as noted , it requires high reheating temperature , in which the model has already been constrained by the thermal contribution strictly . as a result , the conclusion does not change",
