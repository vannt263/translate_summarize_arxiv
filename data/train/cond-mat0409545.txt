    "many dynamic systems generate outputs with fluctuations characterized by @xmath0-like scaling of the power spectra , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency .",
    "these fluctuations are often associated with nonequilibrium dynamic systems possessing multiple degrees of freedom @xcite , rather than being the output of a classic `` homeostatic '' process @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that the presence of many components interacting over a wide range of time or space scales could be the reason for the @xmath0 spectrum in the fluctuations @xcite .",
    "fluctuations exhibiting @xmath0-like behavior are often termed `` complex '' , since they obey a scaling law indicating a hierarchical fractal organization of their frequency ( time scale ) components rather than being dominated by a single frequency .",
    "@xmath0 behavior is common in a variety of physical , biological and social systems @xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of the @xmath0 scale - invariant phenomenon has triggered in recent years the development of generic mechanisms describing complex systems , independent of their particular context , in order to understand the `` unifying '' features of these systems @xcite . to answer the question whether fluctuations in signals generated by integrated physiological systems exhibit the same level of complexity , we analyze and compare the time series generated by two physiologic control systems under multiple - component integrated neural control  the human gait and the human heartbeat .",
    "we chose these two particular examples because human gait and heartbeat control share certain fundamental properties , e.g. , both originate in oscillatory centers . in the case of the heart , the pacemaker is located in the sinus node in the right atrium @xcite . for gait , pacemakers called central pattern generators are thought to be located in the spinal cord @xcite",
    ".    however , these two systems are distinct , suggesting possible dynamical differences in their output .",
    "for example , heartbeat fluctuations are primarily controlled by the involuntary ( autonomic ) nervous system .",
    "in contrast , while the spontaneous walking rhythm is an automatic - like process , voluntary inputs play a major role .",
    "further , gait control resides in the basal ganglia and related motor areas of the central nervous system , while the heartbeat is controlled by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system @xcite .",
    "previous studies show comparable two - point linear correlations and @xmath0 power spectra in heart rate @xcite and human gait @xcite , suggesting that differences in physiologic control may not be manifested in beat - to - beat and interstride interval fluctuations .",
    "recent studies focusing on higher order correlations and nonlinear properties show that the human heartbeat exhibits not only @xmath0 fractal but also multifractal properties @xcite .",
    "since multifractal signals require many scaling indices to fully characterize their scaling properties , they may be considered to be more complex than those characterized by a single fractal dimension , such as classical @xmath0 noise .",
    "although the origins of the multifractal features in heartbeat dynamics are not yet understood , there is evidence that they relate to the complex intrinsic neuroautonomic regulation of the heart @xcite .",
    "human gait , e.g. , free unconstrained walking , is also a physiological process regulated by complex hierarchical feedback mechanisms involving supra - spinal inputs @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent findings indicate that the scaling properties of gait fluctuations relate to neural centers on the higher supra - spinal level rather than to lower motor neurons or environmental inputs @xcite . thus it would be natural to hypothesize that the fluctuations in healthy unconstrained human gait exhibit similar fractal and multifractal features , and that human gait dynamics may belong to the same `` complexity class '' as cardiac dynamics .",
    "we employ two techniques  magnitude and sign decomposition analysis @xcite and multifractal analysis @xcite  to probe long - term nonlinear features , and to compare the levels of complexity in heartbeat and interstride interval fluctuations . to this end",
    ", we analyze interstride interval time series from 10 young healthy men ( mean age 22 years ) with no history of neuromascular disorders @xcite .",
    "subjects walked continuously for 1 hour at a self - selected usual pace on level ground around a flat , obstacle - free , approximately oval , 400 m long path .",
    "the interstride interval was measured using a ground reaction force sensor  ultra - thin force - sensitive switches were taped inside one shoe and data were recorded on an ambulatory recorder using a previously validated method @xcite .",
    "we compare the results of our gait analysis with results we have previously obtained @xcite from 6-hour long heartbeat interval records from 18 healthy individuals ( 13 female and 5 male , mean age 34 years ) during daily activity ( 12:00 to 18:00 ) @xcite .",
    "as described below , we systematically compare the scaling properties of the fluctuations in human gait with those in the human heartbeat using power spectral analysis , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , magnitude and sign decomposition analysis , and wavelet - based multifractal analysis , and we quantify linear and nonlinear features in the data over a range of time scales .",
    "the dfa method was developed because conventional fluctuation analyses , such as power spectral , r / s and hurst analysis can not be reliably used to study nonstationary data @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the dfa method is that it allows the detection of long - range power - law correlations in noisy signals with embedded polynomial trends that can mask the true correlations in the fluctuations of a signal .",

    "recent studies have shown that signals with identical long - range correlations can differ in the time organization of the magnitude and sign of the fluctuations  @xcite . to assess the information contained in these fluctuations , the magnitude and sign decomposition method was introduced  @xcite .",

    "fluctuations following an identical @xmath0 scaling law can exhibit different types of correlations for the magnitude and the sign  e.g. , a signal with anticorrelated fluctuations can exhibit positive correlations in the magnitude .",
    "positive correlations in the magnitude series indicate that an increment with large magnitude is more likely to be followed by an increment with large magnitude .",
    "anticorrelations in the sign series indicate that a positive increment in the original signal is more likely to be followed by a negative increment .",
