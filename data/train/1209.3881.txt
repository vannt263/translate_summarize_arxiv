    "the decoherence of a small quantum system coupled to a fermionic bath has recently attracted much attention  @xcite , due to the fact that the fermionic bath manifests as an important source of decoherence in a wide range of electronic devices designed for solid - state quantum computers . in spite of considerable effort ,",
    "a thorough understanding of the coherence dynamics of fermionic baths is still lack in the non - markovian regime .",
    "the non - markovian dynamics is difficult to address theoretically , because the traditional born - markov approximation is invalid when the relaxation time of the environment is comparably long and then the back - action of the environment plays an important role in the dynamics of the system . to fully take into account the back - actions",
    ", the system - environment coupling must be treated in a non - perturbative way . in recent years , several non - perturbative approaches",
    "have been suggested to derive the master equation in the existence of strong back - actions  @xcite , when the electron - electron interaction is absent or irrelevant to the non - markovian dynamics .",
    "the non - interacting models , however , fail to incorporate the physics in solid - state structures where the coulomb interaction between electrons is greater than the electron kinetic energy .",
    "a well known paradigm is the kondo effect , displayed in quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime . in the kondo effect",
    ", the e - e interaction induces a strong correlation of electrons , which can only be understood from a many - particle point of view .",
    "then it is obliged to study the interplay of correlation physics and non - markovian dynamics .    in this paper , we study the coherence dynamics of quantum dots in the kondo regime coupled to a non - markovian fermionic reservoir .",
    "the model is described by the anderson impurity hamiltonian , which can be written as @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the system hamiltonian , where @xmath2 denotes the gate potential and @xmath3 the coulomb repulsive interaction .",
    "and @xmath4 is the hamiltonian for a non - markovian fermionic reservoir , which is set with a finite bandwidth and a sharp edge .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 .",
    "to solve this problem , we develop the numerical excitation operator method on the basis of previous works by the author  @xcite .",
    "this method is designed for studying the real time dynamics of a strongly - correlated system driven out of equilibrium . as for quantum impurity models",
    ", it is distinguished from various approaches  @xcite devised recently by the fact that both the coulomb interaction and the system - environment coupling are dealt with in its full extent and at the same time the reservoir is set to be infinite .",
    "these are difficult to be fully realized in present approaches .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the excitation operator method .",

    "we choose an orthonormal basis @xmath8 in the operator space which contains all the linear operators mapping the hilbert space into itself .",

    "an arbitrary observable can be decomposed into the linear combination of the basis operators .",

    "we suppose that the excitation operators are expressed by the basis operators as @xmath16 the coefficients matrix @xmath17 needs to be determined . we then calculate the commutators between the hamiltonian and the basis operators @xmath18=\\sum_j \\mathcal{h}_{j , i } \\hat o_j,\\ ] ] and obtain a matrix @xmath19 . by substituting eq .",

    ".    the solution of the heisenberg equation can be expressed by the coefficients @xmath17 as @xmath21 here we use the fact that @xmath17 is unitary .    in practice",
    ", the dimension of @xmath19 grows exponentially with the system size , so that directly diagonalizing it is impossible",
    ". however , there is a layer structure in the operator space , generated by the superoperator @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "this indicates that we could change the problem of diagonalizing @xmath19 into the problem of diagonalizing a series of small matrices .",
    "we consider the evolution of the basis operator @xmath23 in a small time interval @xmath24 .",

    "as @xmath32 , the result will go to the solution of the heisenberg equation .",
    "the point of this method is to utilize the layer structure in the operator space .",
    "that is , the whole basis can be gradually generated from a single basis operator @xmath23 by iteratively calculating the commutators between the hamiltonian and the basis operators .",
    "but there is no such a structure in the hilbert space .",

    "the number of basis operators which need to be stored in calculating @xmath41 increases exponentially as @xmath38 increasing .",
    "this is a problem for numerical calculations .",
    "it can be solved by a truncation scheme : after obtaining @xmath41 one keeps only the @xmath42 basis operators with the largest amplitudes . in this way",
    ", the number of the stored basis operators is fixed to be @xmath42 and the computation time increases linearly with @xmath38 .",
    "suitable values for the parameter @xmath42 depends upon the model . it should be decided numerically by varying @xmath42 .",
    "our system consists of an impurity site , which is coupled , via particle - particle exchanges , to an electron reservoir .",
    "the system plus environment is described by the hamiltonian  [ [ sysenvhamiltonian ] ] . to facilitate applying the excitation operator method , we re -",
    "express the hamiltonian of the reservoir in real space in terms of an infinite chain : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the electron annihilation operator at site @xmath45 .",
    "we take the size of the reservoir to be infinite .",
    "this avoids any coherence oscillation due to the finite - size effects .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian now becomes @xmath46 where the system is coupled only to the first site of the reservoir .",
    "the system hamiltonian keeps invariant as @xmath47    we find an orthonormal basis in the operator space of this model by transforming it into a spin-@xmath48 chain by the jordan - wigner transformation .",

    "the dimension of the local hilbert space at each site is four with the basis vectors @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . keeping in mind that the basis operators are orthogonal to each other",

    "the hamiltonian is real , so that @xmath72 is a real symmetric matrix .",

    "the hamiltonian can be expressed in the basis operators by the jordan - wigner transformation , in which a phase factor is attached to each site to produce the anti - commutative field operators .",
    "they are @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 denote the sites and @xmath77 the phase factor at site @xmath78 .    the hopping term in the hamiltonian can then be expressed as @xmath79 and the system hamiltonian becomes @xmath80    after solving the heisenberg equation , we need to calculate the expectation value of the basis operators with respect to the initial state .",
    "this is done by transforming the basis operators into majorana operators defined as @xmath81 the sixteen local operators at site @xmath45 are in one - to - one correspondence with next majorana operators : @xmath62 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "our method is distinguished from the master equation approach by the fact that no approximation is made on solving the heisenberg equation and the environmental back - actions are fully taken into account .",
    "we set the reservoir at zero temperature , avoiding the thermal fluctuation which would suppress the kondo resonance .",
    "the fermi energy of the reservoir is set to be the energy zero .",
    "we employ the level - broadening at the impurity site @xmath106 , generally defined as @xmath107  @xcite , as the energy unit .",
    "this is usually in studying the anderson impurity model . and the time unit is set to be @xmath108 ( the convention @xmath109 is used throughout the paper ) .",
    "at the particle - hole symmetric point , i.e. , @xmath110 , a large @xmath3 provides a limit to the electron number of the system .",
    "the system is in the kondo regime and can be described by a single spin .",
    "we suppose that its initial state is prepared as a superposition of the spin up and down states , i.e. , @xmath111 . in the decoherence theory considering a markovian environment ,",
    "the coherence of the initial state will be lost in an exponential way after coupled to the reservoir .",
    "however , the real environment in the experiments is usually not markovian , and the back - actions from the environment to the spin can not be neglected .",
    "here we consider a non - markovian reservoir by setting the bandwidth of the reservoir to be comparable with the level - broadening at the impurity , i.e. , @xmath112 .",
    "the results by the excitation operator method , represented by the black circles , are compared with the exact solution , represented by the various types of lines .",

    "this is the feature of a markovian dynamics .",
    "the back - actions of the environment are sufficiently suppressed .",

    "in the existence of a strong interaction , the exponential decays are replaced by oscillations . and the intermediate quasi - steady regimes are observed .",
    "the decoherence time significantly increases as @xmath3 increasing .",

    "as is well known , the equilibrium value of the entropy is @xmath121  @xcite . as @xmath122 , the entropy increases monotonically from zero towards its equilibrium value , corresponding to the exponential decay of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "but as @xmath120 , we find strong oscillations in the entropy , which is the signal of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "the coherence in the initial state is lost and recovered repeatedly , similar to the spin echo effect . however , in our model , the purification of states arises naturally from the e - e interaction and no external driving field is needed as in the spin echo or dynamical decoupling technique  @xcite .",

    "it must be distinguished from the oscillations of coherence observed in the non - markovian environments before  @xcite , where the e - e interaction is absent . without interactions , the electrons move independently , and the non - markovian dynamics can be understood in the single particle picture .",
    "however , in the existence of a strong interaction , the single - particle picture breaks down due to the correlations between electrons . as @xmath120 ,",
    "the dissipation process is controlled by the kondo correlation .",

    "<S> we present a numerical method for studying the real time dynamics of a small interacting quantum system coupled to an infinite fermionic reservoir . by building an orthonormal basis in the operator space </S>",
    "<S> , we turn the heisenberg equation of motion into a system of linear differential equations , which is then solved iteratively by constructing excitation operators . </S>",
    "<S> the application of our method depends on a layer structure in the operator space , which help us to turn an infinite linear system into a series of small systems . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the method to investigate the decoherence dynamics of quantum impurity models in the kondo regime with a non - markovian reservoir . taking full account of environmental back - actions and electron - electron interactions , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the coexistence of the kondo correlation and a non - markovian reservoir induces coherence ringings , which will be suppressed by either driving the system away from the particle - hole symmetric point or changing the reservoir into a markovian one . </S>"
