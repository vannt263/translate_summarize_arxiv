    "the equation that is in the spotlight is the _ advection  diffusion equation _ @xmath0 for the time - evolution of a distribution of concentration  @xmath1 , being _ advected _ by a velocity field  @xmath2 , and _ diffused _ with diffusivity  @xmath3 .",
    "the concentration  @xmath4 is called a _ scalar _ ( as opposed to a vector ) .",
    "we will restrict our attention to incompressible velocity fields , for which  @xmath5 .",
    "for our purposes , we shall leave the exact nature of  @xmath4 nebulous : it could be a temperature , the concentration of salt , dye , chemicals , isotopes , or even plankton .",
    "the only assumption for now is that this scalar is _ passive _ , which means that its value does not affect the velocity field  @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , this is not strictly true of some scalars like temperature , because a varying buoyancy influences the flow , but is often a good approximation nonetheless .",
    "the advection ",
    "diffusion equation  is linear , but contrary to popular belief that does not mean it is simple ! because the velocity ( which is regarded here as a given vector field ) is a function of space and time , the advection term ( the second term in  ) can cause complicated behaviour in  @xmath4 . broadly speaking",
    ", the advection term tends to create sharp gradients of  @xmath4 , whilst the diffusion term ( the term on the right - hand side of  ) tends to wipe out gradients .",
    "the evolution of the concentration field is thus given by a delicate balance of advection and diffusion .",
    "the advection term in   is also known as the _ stirring _ term , and the interplay of advection and diffusion is often called _ stirring and mixing_. as we shall see , the two terms have very different rles , but both are needed to achieve an efficient mixing .    to elicit some broad features of mixing",
    ", we will start by deriving some properties of the advection ",
    "diffusion equation .",
    "first , it conserves the total quantity of  @xmath4 . if we use angle brackets to denote the average of  @xmath4 over the fixed domain of interest  @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e._@xmath8 then we find diretly from   that @xmath9 because the velocity field is incompressible , we have @xmath10 and also  .",
    "thus , we can use the divergence theorem to write   as @xmath11 where  @xmath12 is the surface bounding  @xmath7 , and  @xmath13 is the element of area , and  @xmath14 outward - pointing normal to the surface . for a closed flow ,",
    "two possibilities are now open to us : ( i ) the domain  @xmath7 is periodic ; or ( ii ) @xmath6 and @xmath15 are both tangent to the surface  @xmath12 . in the first case ,",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of   vanish because boundary terms always vanish with periodic boundary conditions ( a bit tautological , but true ! ) . in the second case , both  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 vanish . either way , @xmath18 so that the mean value of  @xmath4 is constant .",
    "since  @xmath7 is constant , this also implies that the total amount of  @xmath4 is conserved .",
    "the second set of boundary conditions we used implies that there is no fluid flow or flux of  @xmath4 through the boundary of the volume .",
    "it is thus natural that the total  @xmath4 is conserved ! for periodic boundary conditions , whatever leaves the volume re - enters on the other side , so it also makes sense that  @xmath4 is conserved .",
    "because of  , and because we can always add a constant to  @xmath4 without changing its evolution ( only derivatives of  @xmath4 appear in  ) , we will always choose @xmath19 without loss of generality . in words :",
    "the mean of our scalar vanishes initially , so by   it must vanish for all times .",
    "now let s look at another average of  @xmath4 : rather than averaging  @xmath4 itself , which has yielded an important but boring result , we average its square . the _ variance _ is defined by @xmath20 where the second term on the right vanishes by  . to obtain an equation for the time - evolution of the variance , we multiply   by  @xmath4 and integrate ,",
    "@xmath21 we rearrange on the left and integrate by parts on the right , to find @xmath22 now there are some boundary terms that vanish under the same assumptions as before , and we get @xmath23 notice that , once again , the velocity field has dropped out of this averaged equation . however , now the effect of diffusion remains .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the term on the right - hand side of   is _ negative - definite _ ( or zero ) : this means that the variance always decreases ( or is constant ) .",
    "the only way it can stop decreasing is if  @xmath15 vanishes everywhere , that is , @xmath4 is constant in space .",
    "but because we have assumed  @xmath24 , this means that  @xmath25 everywhere .",
    "in that case , we have no choice but to declare the system to be _ perfectly mixed _ : there are no variations in  @xmath4 at all anymore .",
    "equation   tells us that variance tends to zero , which means that the system inexorably tends to the perfectly mixed state , without necessarily ever reaching it .",
    "variance is thus a useful measure of mixing : the smaller the variance , the better the mixing .    there is a problem with all this : equation   no longer involves the velocity field .",
    "but if variance is to give us a measure of mixing , should nt its time - evolution involve the velocity field ? is this telling us that stirring has no effect on mixing ?",
    "of course not , as any coffee - drinker will testify , whether she likes it with milk or sugar : stirring has a huge impact on mixing !",
    "so what s the catch ?",
    "[ page : thecatch ] the catch is that   is not a closed equation for the variance : the right - hand side involves  @xmath26 , which is not the same as  @xmath27 .",
    "the extra gradient makes all the difference .",
    "as we will see , under the right circumstances the stirring velocity field creates very large gradients in the concentration field , which makes variance decrease much faster than it would if diffusivity were acting alone .",
    "in fact , when  @xmath3 is very small , in the best stirring flows the gradients of  @xmath4 scale as  @xmath28 , so that the right - hand side of   becomes independent of the diffusivity .",
    "this , in a nutshell , is the essence of _ enhanced mixing_.    several important questions can now be raised :    * how fast is the approach to the perfectly - mixed state ? *",
    "how does this depend on  @xmath3 ?",
    "* what does the concentration field look like for long times ? what is its spectrum ?",
    "* how does the probability distribution of  @xmath4 evolve ? * which stirring fields give efficient mixing ?",
    "the answers to these questions are quite complicated , and not fully known . in the following sections we will attempt to give some hints of the answers and give some references to the literature .",
    "this is not meant to be a comprehensive review article , so entire swaths of the literature are missing .",
    "we focus mainly on _ local _ or _ lagrangian theories _ , which involve deterministic and stochastic approaches for quantifying stretching using a local idealisation of the flow .",
    "the essential feature here is that the advection  diffusion equation  is solved along fluid trajectories .",
    "these theories trace their origins to batchelor  @xcite , who treated constant matrices with slow time dependence , and kraichnan , who introduced fast ( delta - correlated ) time dependence  @xcite .",
    "zeldovich  @xcite approached the problem from the random - matrix theory angle in the magnetic dynamo context .",
    "more recently , techniques from large - deviation theory  @xcite and path integration  @xcite have allowed an essentially complete solution of the problem .",
    "it is this work that will be reviewed here , as it applies to the decay of the passive scalar ( and not the pdf of concentration or its power spectrum ) .",
    "we will favour expediency over mathematical rigour , and try to give a flavour of what these local theories are about without describing them in detail .",
    "the story will proceed from here as follows : in section  [ sec : linear ] advection of a blob by a linear velocity field is considered , with diffusion included .",
    "this problem has an exact solution , but it can be made simpler in the limit of small diffusivity .",
    "solutions are examined for a straining flow in two and three dimensions ( sections  [ sec : strain ] and  [ sec:3d ] ) , as well as a shear flow in two dimensions ( section  [ sec : shear ] ) .",
    "randomness is added in section  [ sec : rsm ] : the strain associated with the velocity field is assumed to vary , and the consequences of this for a single blob ( section  [ sec : oneblob ] ) and a large number of blobs ( section  [ sec : manyblobs ] ) are explored .",
    "practical implementation is discussed in section  [ sec : practical ] , and a simple model for a micromixer is analysed in section  [ sec : decayexample ] . finally , the limitations of the theory presented herein ( section  [ sec : limitations ] ) .",
    "we will start by considering what happens to a passive scalar advected by a linear velocity field .",
    "the overriding advantage of this configuration is that it can be solved analytically , but that is not its only pleasant feature . like most good toy models",
    ", it serves as a nice prototype for what happens in more complicated flows .",
    "it also serves as a building block for what may be called the _ local theory _ of mixing ( section  [ sec : rsm ] ) .    the perfect setting to consider a linear flow is in the limit of large schmidt number .",
    "the schmidt number is a dimensionless quantity defined as @xmath29 where  @xmath30 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and  @xmath3 is the diffusivity of the scalar .",
    "the schmidt number may be thought of as the ratio of the diffusion time for the scalar to that for momentum in the fluid .",
    "alternatively , it can be regarded as the ratio of the ( squared ) length of the smallest feature in the velocity field to that in the scalar field .",
    "this last interpretation is due to the fact that if  @xmath4 varies in space more quickly than  @xmath31 , then its gradient is large and diffusion wipes out the variation . the same applies to variations in the velocity field with respect to  @xmath30 .",
    "hence , for large schmidt number the scalar field has much faster variations than the velocity field .",
    "this means that it is possible to focus on a region of the domain large enough for the scalar concentration to vary appreciably , but small enough that the velocity field appears linear . because there are many cases for which  @xmath32 is quite large , this motivates the use of a linear velocity field .",
    "in fact , large  @xmath32 number is the natural setting for chaotic advection .",
    "it is also the regime that was studied by batchelor and leads to the celebrated batchelor spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the limit of small  @xmath32 is the domain of _ homogenization theory _ and of turbulent diffusivity models .",
    "we shall not discuss such things here .",
    "we choose a linear velocity field of the form @xmath33 where  @xmath34 is a traceless matrix because  @xmath35 must vanish .",
    "inserting this into  , we want to solve the initial value problem @xmath36 here the coordinate  @xmath37 is really a deviation from a reference fluid trajectory .",
    "( in appendix  [ sec : adeqcomov ] we derive   from   by transforming to a comoving frame and assuming the velocity field is smooth . )",
    "we will follow closely the solution of zeldovich  @xcite , who solved this by the method of `` partial solutions . ''",
    "consider a solution of the form @xmath38 where  @xmath39 is some initial wavevector .",
    "we will see if we can make this into a solution by a judicious choice of  @xmath40 and  @xmath41 .",
    "the time derivative of   is @xmath42 and we have @xmath43 putting these together into   and cancelling out the exponential gives @xmath44 this must hold for all  @xmath37 , and neither  @xmath45 nor  @xmath46 depend on  @xmath37 , so we equate powers of  @xmath37 .",
    "this gives the two evolution equations    @xmath47    [ eq : ktheta ]    we can write the solution to   in terms of the _ fundamental solution _  @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and  @xmath51 is the identity matrix .",
    "the advantage of doing this is that we can use the same fundamental solution for all initial conditions .",
    "we will usually write  @xmath52 to mean  @xmath48 .",
    "note that because  @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 this is a standard result that is proved in appendix  [ sec : dett1 ] for completeness .",
    "if  @xmath34 is not a function of time , then the fundamental solution is simply a matrix exponential , @xmath55 but in general the form of  @xmath52 is more complicated .",
    "now that we know the time - dependence of  @xmath46 , we can express the solution to   as    @xmath56    we can think of  @xmath52 as transforming a lagrangian wavevector  @xmath39 to its eulerian counterpart  @xmath46 . thus   expresses the fact that  @xmath45 decays diffusively at a rate determined by the cumulative norm of the wavenumber  @xmath46 experienced during its evolution .",
    "the full solution to   is now given by superposition of the partial solutions , @xmath57 where  @xmath58 is the fourier transform of the initial condition  @xmath59 .",
    "] @xmath60 for the fourier transform in  @xmath61 dimensions . ] assuming the spatial mean of  @xmath4 vanishes , the variance   is @xmath62 which from   becomes @xmath63 we thus have a full solution of the advection  diffusion equation  for the case of a linear velocity field and found the time - evolution of the variance .",
    "but what can be gleaned from it ?",
    "we shall look at some special cases in the following section .",
    "we now take an even more idealised approach : consider the case where the velocity gradient matrix @xmath34 is constant .",
    "furthermore , let us restrict ourselves to two - dimensional flows .",
    "after a coordinate change , the traceless matrix  @xmath34 can only take two possible forms , @xmath64 case ( 2a ) is a purely straining flow that stretches exponentially in one direction , and contracts in the other .",
    "case ( 2b ) is a linear shear flow in the  @xmath65 direction . we assume without loss of generality that  @xmath66 and  @xmath67 .",
    "the form  @xmath68 is known as the jordan canonical form , and can only occur for degenerate eigenvalues . since by incompressibility the sum of these identical eigenvalues must vanish",
    ", they must both vanish .",
    "the corresponding fundamental matrices   are @xmath69 these are easy to compute : in the first instance one merely exponentiates the diagonal elements , in the second the exponential power series terminates after two terms , because the square of  @xmath68 is zero .",
    "let us consider case ( 2a ) , a flow with constant stretching ( the case considered by batchelor  @xcite ) .",
    "the action of the fundamental matrix on  @xmath70 for case ( 2a ) is @xmath71 with norm @xmath72 the wavevector  @xmath73 grows exponentially in time , which means that the length scale is becoming very small .",
    "this only occurs in the direction  @xmath74 , which is sensible because that direction corresponds to a contracting flow .",
    "picture a curtain being closed : the bunching up of the fabric into tight folds is analogous to the contraction .",
    "( of course , it is difficult to close a curtain exponentially quickly forever ! ) the component of the wavevector in the  @xmath65 direction decreases in magnitude , which corresponds to the opening of a curtain",
    ".    let s see what happens to one fourier mode . by inserting   in",
    ", we have @xmath75 the time - integral can be done explicitly , and we find @xmath76 for moderately long times ( @xmath77 ) , we can surely neglect  @xmath78 compared to  @xmath79 , and  @xmath79 compared to  @xmath80 , @xmath81 actually , this assumption of moderately long time is easily justified physically . if  , where  @xmath82 is the largest initial wavenumber ( that is , the smallest initial scale ) , then the argument of the exponential in   is small , unless @xmath83 where the _ pclet number _ is @xmath84 thus the assumption that  @xmath80 is large is a consequence of  @xmath85 being large , since otherwise the exponential in   is near unity and can be ignored  variance is approximately constant .",
    "we can turn   into a requirement on the time , @xmath86 it is clear from   that  @xmath87 sets the time scale for the argument of the exponential in   to become important .",
    "the pclet number influences this time scale only weakly ( logarithmically ) .",
    "this is probably the most important physical fact about chaotic mixing : _ small diffusivity has only a logarithmic effect_. thus vigorous stirring always has a chance to overcome a small diffusivity , no matter how small : we need just stir a bit longer .",
    "note that the variance is given by @xmath88 which is approximately constant for  @xmath89 .",
    "this does _ not _ mean that the concentration field @xmath90 is constant , even if  @xmath40 is , because   is a function of time from  .",
    "this time dependence becomes important for  @xmath77 .",
    "the pclet number may be thought of as the ratio of the advection time of the flow to the diffusion time for the scalar .",
    "it is usually written as @xmath91 where  @xmath92 is a typical velocity and  @xmath93 a typical length scale .",
    "our velocity estimate in   is  @xmath94 , and our length scale is  @xmath82 , which are both natural for the problem at hand . just like large  @xmath32 , large  @xmath85 is the natural setting for chaotic advection .",
    "in fact , if  @xmath85 is small then diffusion is faster than advection , and stirring is not really required !",
    "large  @xmath85 means that diffusion by itself is not very effective , so that stirring is required .",
    "we shall always assume that  @xmath85 is large .",
    "we return to  : the striking thing about that equation is its prediction for the rate of decay of the concentration field . roughly speaking ,",
    "predicts @xmath95 for  .",
    "eq .   is the exponential of an exponential  a _ superexponential _ decay .",
    "this is _ extremely _ fast decay .",
    "in fact , unnaturally so : it is hard to imagine a physically sensible system that could mix this quickly .",
    "something more has to be at work here .",
    "if we examine   closely , we see that the culprit is the term @xmath96 which grows exponentially fast .",
    "this term has its origin in the laplacian in the advection ",
    "diffusion equation  : the contracting direction of the flow ( the  @xmath74 direction ) leads to an exponential increase in the wavenumber via the curtain - closing mechanism .",
    "this is exactly the mechanism for enhanced mixing we advertised on p.  : very large gradients of concentration are being created , exponentially fast .",
    "this mechanism is just acting too quickly for our taste !",
    "so what s the problem ?",
    "we are doing the wrong thing to obtain our estimate  .",
    "this estimate tells us how fast a typical wavevector decays , and it says that this occurs very quickly .",
    "what we really want to know is what modes survive superexponential decay the longest , and at what rate _ they _ decay .",
    "clearly the concentration in most wavenumbers gets annihilated almost instantly , once the condition   is satisfied . but a small number remains : those are the modes with wavevector closely aligned to the  @xmath65 ( stretching ) direction , or equivalently that have a very small projection on the  @xmath74 ( contracting ) direction . to overcome the exponential growth in  ,",
    "we require @xmath97 that is at any given time we need consider only wavenumbers satisfying  , since the concentration in all the others has long since been wiped out by diffusion .",
    "the consequence is that the  @xmath98 integral in   is dominated by these surviving modes . to see this ,",
    "we blow up the  @xmath98 integration by making the coordinate change  @xmath99 in  , @xmath100 the decay factor  @xmath101 has appeared in front . for small diffusivity",
    ", we can neglect the  @xmath102 term in the exponential ( it just smooths out the initial concentration field a little ) .",
    ", @xmath103 needs to be large to matter in the argument of the exponential .",
    "but a smooth @xmath4 decays exponentially with @xmath103 , so there is no variance in these modes anyways .",
    "] we can then take the inverse fourier transform of  @xmath104 , @xmath105 and insert this into  .",
    "we then interchange the order of integration : the  @xmath103 integral gives a  @xmath106-function , and the  @xmath107 integral gives a gaussian .",
    "the final result is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a normalised gaussian distribution with standard deviation  @xmath110 , and we defined the length @xmath111 if the initial concentration decays for large  @xmath112 ( as when we have a single blob of dye ) , then   can be simplified to @xmath113    so the  @xmath65 dependence in   is given by the `` stretched '' initial distribution , averaged over  @xmath74 . the important thing",
    "to notice is that @xmath114 this is a much more reasonable estimate for the decay of concentration than  !",
    "the concentration thus decays exponentially at a rate given by the rate - of - strain ( or stretching rate ) in our flow .",
    "the exponential decay is entirely due to the narrowing of the domain for eligible ( _ i.e. _ , nondecayed ) modes .",
    "this `` domain of eligibility '' is also known as the _ cone _ or the _ cone of safety _  @xcite .",
    "( in two dimensions it is more properly called a wedge . )",
    "the concentration associated with wavevectors that fit within this cone is temporarily shielded from being diffusively wiped out , but as the aperture of the cone is shrinking exponentially more and more modes leave the safety of the cone as time progresses .",
    "notice that   is independent of  @xmath3 .",
    "this brings us to the second most important physical fact about chaotic mixing : _ the asymptotic decay rate of the concentration field tends to be independent of diffusivity_. but note that a nonzero diffusivity is crucial in forcing the alignment  .",
    "the only effect of the diffusivity is to lengthen the wait before exponential decay sets in , as given by the estimate  . but this effect is only logarithmic in the diffusivity .    we can also try to think of   in real rather than fourier space . consider an initial distribution of concentration .",
    "our straining flow will stretch this distribution in the  @xmath65 direction , and contract it in the  @xmath74 direction .",
    "gradients in  @xmath74 will thus become very large , so that eventually diffusion will limit further contraction in the  @xmath74 direction and the distribution will stabilise with width  @xmath115 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : strainblob ] ) .",
    "this is what the gaussian prefactor in   is telling us : the asymptotic distribution has `` forgotten '' its initial shape in  @xmath74 .",
    "we say that the contracting direction has been _",
    "stabilised_.    .",
    "]      so far we have only considered case ( 2a ) in  . for case ( 2b ) , we have from   @xmath116 with norm @xmath117 inserting   in  , we have @xmath118 we can then explicitly do the time integral in the exponential , @xmath119 the enhancement to diffusion in this case is reflected in the cubic power of time in the exponential .",
    "this is not as strong as the exponential enhancement of case ( 2a ) , but is nevertheless very significant .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ shear dispersion _ or _",
    "taylor dispersion_. the mechanism is often called the _ venetian blind _ effect . assuming the initial distribution  @xmath120 depends only on  @xmath103 , then lines of constant concentration which are initially vertical are tilted by the shear flow , in a manner reminiscent of venetian blinds .",
    "the distance between the lines of constant concentration decreases with time as  @xmath121 , which gives an effective enhancement to diffusion .",
    "the time required to overcome a weak diffusivity is thus @xmath122 if we use  @xmath123 as a length scale and  @xmath124 as a time scale , we can define a pclet number @xmath125 and rewrite   as @xmath126 which should be compared to  , the corresponding expression for the case ( 2a ) . here there is a power law dependence on the pclet number , rather than logarithmic , so we may have to wait a long time for diffusion to become important .",
    "this makes the linear velocity field approximation more likely to break down .",
    "let us consider the time - asymptotic limit  @xmath127 : we might then be tempted to neglect everything but the  @xmath128 term in the argument of the exponential in  .",
    "however , this would be a mistake . to see",
    "more clearly what happens , define the dimensionless time   and the length  .",
    "equation   then becomes @xmath129 the first two terms in the exponential are just what is expected of regular diffusion in the absence of flow .",
    "the next term is the enhancement to diffusion along the  @xmath65 direction : it will force the modes  @xmath130 to be dominant , since everything else will be damped away .",
    "similarly , the last term forces  @xmath131 . assuming these scalings , the only term that can be neglected for   is the very first one ,  @xmath132 .",

    "if  @xmath154 , then we have @xmath155 whilst for  @xmath156 @xmath157 both approximations are valid when  @xmath158 . for  @xmath159 the situation is similar to the two - dimensional case ( 2a ) : @xmath160 valid when  .",

    "we thus find for  , @xmath164 and for  , @xmath165 where  .",
    "contracting directions have their spatial dependence given by a time - independent gaussian , with an overall exponential decay ; stretching directions do just that : they stretch the initial distribution , with no diffusive effect .",

    "tubes_.    there is another way of thinking about the asymptotic forms  ,  , and  @xcite : contracting directions are stabilised near some constant width @xmath166 , and expanding directions lead to exponential growth of the width of an initial distribution along the direction .",
    "thus , the volume of the initial distribution grows exponentially at a rate given by the sum of  @xmath167 s associated with stretching directions , but the total amount of  @xmath4 remains fixed ( the mean is conserved ) .",
    "hence , the concentration at a point should decay inversely proportional to the volume , which is exactly what  ,  , and   predict .",

    "in section  [ sec : oneblob ] we considered the evolution of the concentration of a single blob of concentration in a random straining field .",
    "now we turn our attention to a large number of blobs , homogeneously and isotropically distributed , with random concentrations .",
    "we assume that the mean concentration over all the blobs is zero .",
    "a simplified view of this initial situation is depicted in figure  [ fig : overlapblobs](a ) , with shades of gray indicating different concentrations .",
    "if we now apply a uniform straining flow of the type ( 2a ) ( see section  [ sec : strain ] ) , the blobs are all stretched horizontally ( the  @xmath65 direction ) and contracted in the vertical ( @xmath74 ) direction , as shown in figure  [ fig : overlapblobs](b ) .",
    "they are pressed together in the  @xmath74 direction until diffusion becomes important ( figure  [ fig : overlapblobs](c ) ) .",
    "the effect of diffusion is to homogenise the concentration field until it reaches a value which is the average of the concentration of the individual blobs .",

    "the summing ( and hence averaging ) over blobs is manifest in eq .  , which contains an integral over the initial distribution  @xmath120 in the  @xmath74 direction , windowed by a gaussian .",
    "in practice , this implies that the expected value of the concentration at a point  @xmath37 on the gray filament is given by @xmath224 where  @xmath225 is the initial concentration of the  @xmath171th blob , and  @xmath226 denotes the expected value of the sum over the overlapping blobs at point  @xmath37 ( not the same as spatial integration  @xmath227 ) .",
    "we assume that   blobs have overlapped .",
    "equation   gives the concentration at a point , summed over  @xmath228 overlapping blobs .",
    "of course , eq .",
    "converges to zero for large  @xmath228 , because the blobs average out . not so for the fluctuations at that point",
    ": by the central limit theorem , we have @xmath229 since the initial blobs have identical distributions .",
    "the blob - summed fluctuation amplitude  @xmath230 is thus proportional to the number  @xmath228 of overlapping blobs .",
    "but the number of overlapping blobs is proportional to  @xmath231 : as time increases more and more blobs converge to a given  @xmath37 in the contracting direction and overlap diffusively ( this can be seen in eq .  :",
    "the width of the windowing region grows as  @xmath232 ) . assuming the variance of  @xmath225 is finite , we conclude from   that @xmath233 compare this to   for the single - blob case : the overlap between blobs has led to an extra square root .",
    "thus , the ensemble averages  @xmath234 for the overlapping blobs are computed exactly as in section  [ sec : oneblob ] , resulting in  . because of the assumption of homogeneity , the point - average is the same as the average over the whole domain ( see section  [ sec : practical ] for more on this ) , and we have @xmath235 with  @xmath209 given by  .",

    "the situation is basically identical to the 2d case of sections  [ sec : oneblob][sec : manyblobs ] : the statistics of the stretching direction  @xmath236 determine  @xmath209 from  .",
    "the contracting directions  @xmath74 and  @xmath161 are stabilised by diffusion .",
    "for  @xmath237 , the asymptotic concentration is given by   ( pancakes ) .",
    "we have two fluctuating quantities to worry about ( @xmath236 and  @xmath148 ) .",
    "but since the decay rate in   only depends on  @xmath238 , we can instead focus on its fluctuations only . for a single blob , the average",
    "is then replaced by @xmath239 where of course  @xmath240 is the average of  @xmath238 .",
    "this pdf achieves a distribution of the large - deviation form  .",
    "the analysis thus follows exactly as in sections  [ sec : oneblob ] and  [ sec : manyblobs ] , except the cramr function for  @xmath241 must be used .",
    "one may rightly wonder if the blobs in a random uniform straining flow depicted in section  [ sec : rsm ] bear any resemblance to reality .",
    "the single - blob scenario does nt , but the many - blobs scenario has a fighting chance , as we will try to justify here .",
    "there are two important considerations : where does the ensemble - averaging come from , and what are the stretching rates given by ?",
    "the decay rate   depends crucially on ensemble - averaging : with that averaging the decay rate fluctuates wildly for a given realisation .",
    "at the end of section  [ sec : manyblobs ] we assumed that homogeneity allowed us to generalise from the average at a point to the average over the whole domain .",
    "but the average over the whole domain can actually do a lot more for us : it can provide the ensemble of blobs that we need for averaging !",
    "thus , we can forget about speaking of realisations as if we were running many parallel experiments , and instead speak of the moments of the concentration field as given by an average over randomly - distributed blobs .",
    "the decay rate will then be naturally smoothed - out over blobs experiencing different stretching histories .",
    "the saturation of the decay rate with  @xmath182 in eq .",
    "is due to  @xmath242 being dominated by the fraction of blobs that have experienced no stretching .    what about the stretching rates  @xmath149",
    "luckily , it is not them but their time - average  @xmath180 that matters .",
    "if we imagine following a blob as it moves through the flow , we can see that this time - averaged stretching rate is nothing but the finite - time lyapunov exponent associated with this blob and its particular initial condition .",
    "a given blob will be constantly reoriented as it moves along in the flow , so its finite - time lyapunov exponent is not just the average of the stretching rates ( in fact , it must be strictly less than this average ) .",
    "but in a chaotic system we are guaranteed that , on average , these reorientations do not lead to a vanishing ( infinite - time ) lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is guaranteed by the celebrated oseledec multiplicative theorem for random matrices  @xcite .",
    "we may thus use for  @xmath187 the distribution of finite - time lyapunov exponents , which is well - known to have the large - deviation form  @xcite .",
    "the result of these considerations is the _ local theory _ of passive scalar decay .",
    "it is called local because of the reliance of such a local concept as the finite - time lyapunov exponents , which come from a linearisation near fluid element trajectories . in section  [ sec : decayexample ] we discuss a specific example .",
    "we postpone a discussion of the validity of the local theory until section  [ sec : limitations ] , but for now we point out that it is known to be exact at least in some simple model flows  @xcite .",
    "the derivation presented in this section was based on the work of balkovsky and fouxon  @xcite , who used a slightly more rigorous approach .",
    "son  @xcite also obtained the decay rate   using path - integral methods .",
    "earlier , antonsen  @xcite derived the decay rate for the second moment  @xmath243 in terms of the cramr function , using a different ( and not quite equivalent ) approach , though they did not allow for the second case in  .",
    "we illustrate how to compute the decay rates  @xmath209 with a practical problem .",
    "specifically , we will use a three - dimensional model of a microchannel .",

    "a typical mean fluid velocity is  @xmath246@xmath247.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it consists of a narrow channel , roughly  @xmath248 wide and slightly shallower .",
    "these types of channel are widely used in microfluidics applications ( `` lab - on - a - chip '' ) , and often one wants to achieve good mixing in the lateral cross - section of the channel .",
    "this is difficult , since the reynolds number of the flow varies between  @xmath249 and  @xmath250far from turbulent .",
    "clever techniques have to be used to induce chaotic motion of the fluid particle trajectories in order to enhance mixing .",
    "stroock  @xcite used patterned grooves at the bottom of the channel to induce vortical motions , and found that the mixing efficiency was dramatically increased . here",
    "we use a variation on this where the bottom is pattern with an electro - osmotic coating , which induces fluid motion near the wall  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the electro - osmotic coating is well - approximated by a moving wall boundary condition .",
    "the pattern is chosen in a so - called herringbone pattern to maximise the mixing efficiency ( though not in a staggered herringbone , which is even better but is more difficult to model ) .",
    "rather than solving the full equations numerically , we adopt here an analytical model based on stokes flow in a shallow layer  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal ( @xmath218 ) direction is taken to be periodic .",
