    "in this section , we will first explain the basic principle of the photonic faraday rotation .     and two degenerate ground states @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "1 , a three - level atom is trapped in the cavity .",
    "it has an excited state @xmath15 and two degenerate ground states @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the transitions between the @xmath15 and @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 are assisted with a left - circularly ( @xmath16 ) and right - circularly ( @xmath17 ) polarized photon , respectively .",
    "we can write the hamiltonian of the system as @xcite @xmath18\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\hbar\\lambda\\sum_{j = l , r}(a_{j}^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{j-}+a_{j}\\sigma_{j+})+h_{r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}d\\omega\\sum_{j = l , r}\\overline{\\alpha}(\\omega)(c_{j}^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{j-}+c_{j}\\sigma_{j+}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field and the frequency of the cavity field is @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the lowering and raising operators of the transition r(l ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath27 is the atomic frequency and @xmath28 means the hamiltonian of the free reservoirs .",
    "briefly speaking , we consider a single photon pulse with frequency @xmath29 enters the optical cavity .",
    "using the adiabatic approximation , we can obtain the input - output relation of the cavity field in the form of @xcite @xmath30[i(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{p})+\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } ] + \\lambda^{2}}{[i(\\omega_{c}-\\omega_{p})+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}][i(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{p})+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}]+\\lambda^{2}}.\\label{reflect1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ reflect1 ] ) , if @xmath31 , above equation for an empty cavity can be written as @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the frequency of the photon . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the cavity damping rate and atomic decay rate .",
    "the @xmath36 is the atom - cavity coupling strength .",
    "the total physical picture of the process can be described as follows : if a left circular polarization photon enters the cavity , and couples with the atom in the state @xmath13 , the photon will be reflected to the output mode but induce a phase shift , which can be described as @xmath37 . here @xmath38 .",
    "interestingly , if the right - circular photon enters the cavity and couples with the atom in the state @xmath13 , it only senses the empty cavity . after the photon reflecting from the cavity",
    ", the whole process can be written as @xmath39 . here",
    "therefore , if a single photon state @xmath41 enters the cavity and couples with the @xmath13 atom , the whole system can be described as @xmath42 on the other hand , if @xmath41 enters the cavity and couples with the @xmath14 atom , the whole system can be described as @xmath43 the @xmath44 is called the faraday rotation .",
    "if we consider the cases that @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , we can obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we can rewrite the relationship between the photon and the atom as @xmath50 polarization and reflect the photon in the @xmath51 polarization . here",
    "d1 , d2 , d3 and d4 are four single - photon detectors.,width=264 ]",
    "now we start to explain our protocol . as shown in fig . 1",
    ", two pairs of atomic entanglement are shared by alice and bob , respectively .",
    "suppose that they are in the same arbitrary two - qubit states of the form @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "first , they prepare two single photons with the same polarization @xmath56 .",
    "they let the two photons in the intput1 and input2 pass through the cavities , respectively .",
    "the four atoms can be written as @xmath57 therefore , after the two photons passing through the four cavities , if both photons do not change and transmit the polarization beam splitters ( pbss ) and finally are detected by single photon detectors d@xmath58 and d@xmath59 , the atomic state will become @xmath60 with the total success probability of @xmath61 .",
    "after they obtain the state @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ step1 ] ) , they perform the hadamard operations on the atoms a1 and a2 , which makes the @xmath63 become @xmath64 from eq .",
    "( [ step2 ] ) , after performing the hadamard operation , the atoms a1 and a2 are entangled .",
    "finally , they still prepare a single photon in the input1 mode of the form @xmath41 , and let it pass through the two cavities a1 and a2 . if the photon s polarization does not change , it will project the atoms a1 and a2 into the singlet state @xmath65 therefore , if the photon passes through the cavities and finally be detected by the single - photon detector d@xmath58 in a second time , the state @xmath66 will collapse to @xmath67 the success probability for obtaining the state @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "the total success probability for obtaining the state @xmath68 is @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we can get @xmath71    . we let @xmath72.,width=302 ]    interestingly , from eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , we have established the relationship between the concurrence of the atomic entanglement and the success probability for measuring the photons . in a practical experiment , we should repeat this protocol for many times to obtain the success probability @xmath73 by calculating the ratio between the detected photon number and the initial total photon number .",
    "so far , we have briefly described our protocol with a simple example .",
    "it is shown that we can complete the detection of the concurrence of arbitrary two - qubit atomic pure state by input - output processing of photons . in the pioneer work of romero _ et al .",
    "_ , they also discussed the measurement for concurrence of atomic two - qubit pure states .",
    "they require the atomic cnot gate to complete the task .",
    "however , the cnot gate can not be well performed in current experimental conditions . in this protocol",

    "that is to say , the imperfect operation does not affect the fidelity of the state .",
    "if the atomic state is @xmath86 or @xmath87 , it will make the polarization of the photon change , which will has some probability to be @xmath41 , and finally be detected by d@xmath58 or d@xmath59 . in this way",

    "the second item @xmath93 also has the probability of @xmath94 to make d@xmath58 and d@xmath59 both fire .",
    "therefore , if @xmath95 , we can estimate the total success probability as @xmath96 here we omit the contribution of @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the concurrence will be increased because of the imperfection . on the other hand",
    ", we should also consider the photon loss .",
    "the photon loss is the main obstacle in realistic experiment .",
    "the minor misalignment , cavity mirror absorption and scattering , and even the tiny piece of dust , can induce the photon loss .",
