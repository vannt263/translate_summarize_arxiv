    "less familiar to observers are the intersystem bands of co , which involve the triplet states @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , whose electric dipole transitions to the ground state @xmath11 are spin - forbidden .",
    "these triplet states have potential energy curves that cross the curve of @xmath10see figure 1 of rostas et al .",
    "( 2000)and via mutual perturbations acquire a small percentage of @xmath15 character at the expense of the singlet state .",
    "the resulting triplet - singlet @xmath6-values are relatively small , thus turning the intersystem bands into very useful astrophysical probes along interstellar ( is ) sight lines for which the _ a@xmath7x _ bands are optically thick , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter rostas et al . ) presented predictions from extended calculations of the triplet - singlet mixing coefficients , partly as an attempt to resolve discrepancies between previous theoretical ( mn ) and astrophysical @xmath6-values .",
    "rostas et al . also conducted low - resolution laboratory measurements at room temperature to improve upon the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "high - resolution laboratory measurements on two intersystem bands were also reported by @xcite .    using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath16 ) , we obtained a high - resolution echelle spectrum of the o9.5v star x per ( hd 24534 ) with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) . permitted _",
    "a@xmath7x _ bands along this line of sight",
    "were first modeled by @xcite , who based his analysis of @xmath0co on archival @xmath16 goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) observations . for our stis observations ,",
    "the weakest permitted band available for analysis is the _ a@xmath7x _ ( 8@xmath70 ) band , which still has a large optical depth ( @xmath17 ) in the cores of the strongest lines , @xmath17(@xmath18(0 ) )  @xmath19 70 .",
    "therefore , the column density ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath0co toward x per can be measured more reliably from the observed intersystem bands , which have a much smaller @xmath17 . in this letter",
    ", we determine @xmath20(@xmath0co ) through a comparison with our previous observations of intersystem bands toward @xmath1 oph ( f94 ) .",
    "then we derive is @xmath6-values toward x per for all seven `` old '' bands and for five intersystem bands seen in is spectra for the first time .",
    "finally , we compare our @xmath6-values with the predictions of rostas et al .",
    "regarding nomenclature , we make use in this paper of the short notation introduced by rostas et al . , where , e.g. , @xmath2112 stands for _ d@xmath7x _",
    "( 12@xmath70 ) .",
    "stis spectra of x per were acquired in 2001 february and march with grating e140h during 10,728  s over five orbits , yielding the data sets o64812010@xmath7030 and o64813010@xmath7020 .",
    "the star was observed through the smallest aperture ( 0.1  @xmath2 0.03 ) , which was designed to provide the highest resolving power , @xmath18  = 200,000 @xcite .",
    "elaborate reduction procedures had to be employed in order to correct for odd - even sub - pixel effects in the unbinned ( 2048-pixel ) exposures .",
    "normal reduction routines were then followed by processing the spectra in the stsdas environment of iraf .",
    "the five orbital exposures were co - added into a single spectrum of 42 orders , sporting a signal - to - noise ratio of 70 , or 100 for features detected and combined from two adjacent overlapping orders .",
    "since the continuum is modulated by shallow photospheric features from x per , short spectral segments centered on features ( bands ) of interest were rectified and normalized before being compared to a fitted synthetic model of the pertinent feature .",
    "flux and wavelength calibrations were performed by the space telescope science institute pipeline and supplied with the binned , 1024-pixel exposures .",
    "a previous analysis of @xmath0co by @xcite inferred that this line of sight involves two unresolved velocity components .",
    "however , the significantly higher resolution of our spectrum shows profile asymmetries due to underlying structure , which required four components for a good fit .",
    "this is the same number of components found in preliminary fits of high - resolution spectra of x per ( d. e. welty , private communication ) , although we derived a different set of relative velocities , fractions , and component widths .",
    "some 87% of the total @xmath20(@xmath0co ) resides in a main component with a doppler parameter ( @xmath22-value ) of 0.39 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the other three components have between 2% and 9% shares of @xmath20 , with @xmath22-values between 0.17 and 2.09 km  s@xmath5 , as will be fully described in a future paper .",
    "the highly saturated _",
    "a@xmath7x _ bands could be fitted only once the total @xmath20 was established via the intersystem bands .",
    "our method of analysis employed a multi - parametric spectrum synthesis code based on voigt profile line transfer equations given in @xcite .",
    "the computed absorption spectrum was convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile ( jenkins & tripp 2001 ) and then matched with the data via rms - minimization down to relative parameter steps of 10@xmath23 or less .",
    "in order to determine @xmath6-values for intersystem bands , @xmath20(@xmath0co ) toward x per must be known . for optically thin features ,",
    "the equivalent width ( @xmath24 ) is proportional to @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath24  @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "we can , therefore , utilize the published value of @xmath20 toward @xmath1 oph and the ratio of @xmath24s for optically thin bands toward the two stars in the determination of @xmath20 toward x per",
    ". the result should be independent of the intersystem @xmath6-values and of the modeled cloud structure , provided we exclude the @xmath24 ratio for the optically thick @xmath2714 .",
    "column 4 of table 1 lists the ratios of band @xmath24 toward x per over band @xmath24 toward @xmath1 oph . among the optically thin bands",
    ", the highest @xmath24 ratio belongs to @xmath284 , which was the faintest intersystem band analyzed by f94 .",
    "in addition , @xmath284 also sports the largest deviation of derived @xmath6-value in the low-@xmath17 sample of f94 .",
    "it is clear that f94 underestimated the low - resolution @xmath24 for @xmath284 due to placing the continuum too low ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "dropping the @xmath284 band , and thus avoiding a 5% increase in the average , we obtain @xmath29(x  per)/@xmath29(@xmath1  oph )  = 5.54  @xmath30 0.87 . under the necessary and fulfilled condition of optical thinness ,",
    "this is also the ratio of @xmath20(x  per ) over @xmath20(@xmath1  oph ) .",
    "here we shall adopt the @xcite column density toward @xmath1 oph , @xmath20(@xmath0co )  = ( 2.54  @xmath30 0.16 )  @xmath2 10@xmath31 @xmath4 , which was also employed by f94 .",
    "based on the measured @xmath20 ratio , we infer that @xmath20(@xmath0co ) toward x per is ( 1.41  @xmath30 0.22 )  @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "kaczmarczyk ( 2000b ) found ( 1.0  @xmath30 0.2 )  @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 from an analysis of permitted _ a@xmath7x _ bands ; the agreement between the two determinations is at the 2-@xmath32 level .",
    "recall , however , that kaczmarczyk s model has fewer cloud components and larger @xmath22-values , readily accounting for its reduced column density .",
    "the crossings of vibrational levels in a triplet state and vibrational levels in the @xmath10 state occur near certain rotational @xmath33 levels . therefore , mixing coefficients depend on @xmath33 and thus intersystem @xmath34-values generated by interaction with @xmath10 have a dependence on @xmath35 . whereas all previous calculations of mixing coefficients focused on the vibrational level of the a state ( @xmath36 ) closest to the perturbing triplet level , i.e. , a single-@xmath36 treatment , rostas et al",
    ". were the first to use multi-@xmath36 computations that included all @xmath37 levels with @xmath38  = 0 to 12 .",
    "they derived @xmath34-values that for some intersystem bands were in better agreement with their own experimental results ( @xmath35  = 300  k ) , and/or with the is results of f94 ( @xmath35  = 4.2  k ) .",
    "still , the calculated @xmath6-values of rostas et al .",
    "are `` a few percent '' off , because the changes in @xmath39@xmath40 of the `` parent '' _ a@xmath7x _ bands induced by mixing with other triplet levels were ignored .",
    "in addition , differences of a few percent are expected due to the adopted sources for _ a@xmath7x _ @xmath6-values : mn and we used values from @xcite , while rostas et al.s preference lies with values published by @xcite .    the mn line oscillator strength , @xmath41@xmath40 , which we use as input for the fits , includes @xmath39@xmath40 for the permitted _ a@xmath7x _ band and the usual h@xmath42nl - london rotational factor , as well as the single-@xmath36 strength of the perturbation . according to rostas et al .",
    ", for triplet levels that cross the @xmath37 levels at low values of @xmath33 , single-@xmath36 and multi-@xmath36 calculations should not differ by a large factor since the interaction with the nearest `` parent '' @xmath36 level is predominant .",
    "therefore , using @xmath41@xmath40-values from mn is a valid approach while searching for relatively small corrections due to multi-@xmath36 interactions .",
    "this condition is appropriate for all bands studied here , except for @xmath217 , @xmath2110 , and to a lesser extent , @xmath284 . on the other hand , intersystem bands that are farther from their nearest parents",
    "have `` @xmath43-independent '' @xmath34-values due to their high-@xmath33 crossing , especially under is conditions .",
    "again , using @xmath41@xmath40-values from mn poses no difficulties for scaling the integrated band @xmath6-values thanks to negligible high-@xmath33@xmath44 level populations .",
    "indeed , we made no attempt to fit rotational lines independently of each other ; our syntheses did not indicate a need to adjust individual @xmath41@xmath40-values . rather than varying the @xmath6-values ,",
    "our variable parameters were @xmath20(@xmath0co ) , which scales the entire band , and @xmath35 , which determines its shape .",
    "eleven @xmath0co bands exhibit similar excitation temperatures with averages of @xmath45  = 6.1  @xmath30 1.0  k and @xmath46  = 5.9  @xmath30 0.4  k. lower @xmath35 were suggested by the fit to @xmath2714 , presumably due to effects of higher @xmath17 . although @xmath34 depends on @xmath35 , the difference in @xmath6-values between @xmath35  = 4.2  k and @xmath35  = 6.0  k is @xmath47  1% , which we ignore here .",
    "one additional variable fitting parameter was the heliocentric radial velocity .",
    "for the main component , the average value from nine @xmath0co intersystem bands is 14.7  @xmath30 1.0  km  s@xmath5 , where the 1  @xmath32 error is dominated by stis wavelength calibration uncertainties .",
    "this radial velocity is in very good agreement with the fits mentioned in   2 .",
    "table 1 lists results of synthetic fits for 12 intersystem bands detected in our spectrum of x per . for the reference",
    "@xmath6-values we used the mn @xmath41@xmath40-values of the @xmath18(0 ) lines , which agree to @xmath30  1% of @xmath34-values calculated for @xmath35  = 4.2  k , except for @xmath2714 and @xmath2717 , which have low-@xmath33 crossings and for which the @xmath18(0 ) @xmath6-values are off by @xmath47  2% .",
    "each ratio of a fitted @xmath34-value over the reference mn value was computed from the ratio of each band s fitted @xmath20(@xmath0co ) over the actual @xmath20 determined in   3 .",

    "the rostas et al .",
    "values are based on multi-@xmath36 calculations while the mn values refer to single-@xmath36 results .",
    "the theoretical ratios in column 8 lack formal error bars , although deviations due to the presence of other triplet levels and to absolute scales should amount to a few percent .",
    "the last column directly compares @xmath6-values from x per to those from rostas et al .",
    "the first seven bands listed in table 1 were previously detected toward @xmath1 oph by f94 .",
    "as discovered by f94 , the measured @xmath6-value of @xmath217 toward x per is five times greater than the value listed by mn in their tables 5 and 14 .",
    "however , mn list another @xmath6-value for @xmath217 in their table 7 , based on measurements by eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ; the latter result is more in line with both is @xmath6-values and was confirmed in room temperatures experiments by rostas et al .",
    "the more rigorous multi-@xmath36 calculation reproduces the astronomical @xmath6-values much better than a single-@xmath36 prediction because @xmath217 is relatively far from its nearest parent , @xmath372 .",
    "our new @xmath6-value is 6% ( 0.4  @xmath32 ) lower than the prediction by rostas et al . , while the f94 result differs by 1% only .",

    "( 2002 ) that @xmath34(@xmath217 ) should be reduced by ( 29  @xmath30 15)% relative to rostas et al .",
    "our synthesis of the optically thick @xmath2714 toward x per returns an @xmath6-value 6% smaller than that listed by mn , @xmath48 the f94 result of @xmath724% .",
    "the agreement with the newer predictions is better : the f94 @xmath6-value is lower by 19% , whereas the x per result is identical to that of rostas et al .",
    "according to them , single-@xmath36 and multi-@xmath36 @xmath6-values are also identical : 8.3  @xmath2 10@xmath23 .",
    "thus , ironically , the strong @xmath2714 can not help to distinguish between the two methods because its ( single ) interaction with @xmath374 is extremely predominant .",
    "all other five bands , @xmath2711 , @xmath2717 , @xmath2112 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 , are also found to be in very good agreement with the multi-@xmath36 predictions of rostas et al .",

    "the f94 @xmath6-value for @xmath284 remains their most discrepant result ( after @xmath217 ) .",

    "two bands agree to @xmath30 12% with these predictions , while the @xmath6-value of our faintest band , @xmath2110 , is @xmath734% ( @xmath72.3  @xmath32 ) away from its predicted value .",
    "the high @xmath20(co ) toward x per also provides us with a clean detection of a fully resolved intersystem band from the @xmath8co isotopomer , namely , @xmath2112 .",
    "this band was suggested to exist by mn in the @xmath1 oph spectrum of @xmath376 analyzed by @xcite . for @xmath8co ,",
