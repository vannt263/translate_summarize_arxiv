    "the realization that the dynamics of qcd in the hadron world can be addressed at low energies by means of effective theories in which the building blocks are the ground state mesons and baryons @xcite has produced tools to address the interaction of mesons or mesons and baryons , mainly through chiral lagrangians , which have had a tremendous impact in our understanding of the spectrum of mesons and baryon resonances .",
    "we all accept that ground states of mesons and baryons are made of @xmath3 or three @xmath4 respectively . yet",
    ", the spectrum of excited hadronic states can be much richer as we shall see .",
    "the building blocks in these chiral theories are the low energy hadrons , such as the proton and baryons of its su(3 ) octet .",
    "to these one adds also the decuplet of the @xmath5 , considered as spin realignments of the three quark ground state .",
    "the basic mesons are the pion and mesons of its octet , to which one also adds the nonet of the @xmath6 , which also corresponds to spin realignments of the @xmath3 ground state .",
    "what about baryon resonances ?",
    "the logical answer is that they are excitations of the quarks , which is the essence of quark models .",
    "this is plausible , but things could be more complicated .",
    "let us recall basic facts from the baryon spectrum .",
    "the first excited @xmath7 states are the @xmath8 @xmath9 and the @xmath10 @xmath11 . in quark models",
    "this will require quark excitation of around 500 - 600 mev .",
    "if this is the case , one may think that it takes less energy to create one pion , or two ( 140 - 280 mev ) .",
    "the question is whether they can be bound or get trapped in a resonant state .",
    "how do we know if this can occur ? we need dynamics , a potential for the interaction of mesons with ground state baryons and then solve the schroedinger equation ( bethe salpeter equation with mesons treated relativistically ) in coupled channels .",
    "this information can be extracted from chiral lagrangians : the effective theory of qcd at low energies .",
    "this is the philosophy behind the idea of dynamically generated baryons : many resonances are generated in this way , like the @xmath12 states from meson baryon : @xmath13 @xcite , two @xmath0 @xcite or the @xmath1 states from two mesons and a baryon , like the @xmath14 and others @xcite .    from the pseudoscalar - baryon octet interaction",
    "there are many states generated and one sees them as peaks in the scattering matrices or poles in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "a feature of the chiral unitary approach is its great predictive power , with the risk that some of the predictions might not be fulfilled in nature .",
    "but , so far , predictions are corroborated in production reactions , partial decay rates , meson baryon scattering amplitudes , helicity amplitudes , transition form factors @xcite .",
    "as an example we recall in the next section some of the early calculations on photoproduction of the @xmath0 , taking advantage that two experiments are now reported in this conference ten years after the predictions were made .",
    "ten years ago , with spring8/osaka in its initial stage , an application of the chiral unitary approach was made to predict cross sections for photoproduction of the @xmath0 @xcite in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 reactions .",
    "the cross sections found were within measurable range , the @xmath0 could be clearly seen in the @xmath18 mass distribution , as usual , and the signal was much larger than the background .",
    "the experiment was early started at spring8 and preliminary results were shown in 2003 @xcite .",
    "five years later final results were published in @xcite , which have been reported in this conference @xcite .",
    "also jeff lab has carried out the experiment with a different set up and the results have also been presented in this conference @xcite .",
    "the model used in @xcite was a minimal model , in which only the @xmath19 vertex coming from minimal coupling , with p and b a pseudoscalar meson from the octet of the @xmath20 and b a baryon of the octet of the @xmath21 , was used .",
    "possible effects of baryon resonances in the @xmath22 entrance channels were neglected . in spite of this , the agreement of data with the predictions is quite fair .",
    "a large signal is seen with small background .",
    "the size of the cross section is within 50 % of the predictions . in adidtion , the observed @xmath23 , @xmath24 distributions are not equal ;",
    "they are shifted by a few mev as predicted .",
    "this is a consequence of the effect of an isospin i=1 amplitude , which acts constructively in one case and destructively in the other .",
    "the @xmath17 was predicted to be roughly the average of the other two cross sections .",
    "the details of the recent experiments can be seen in the devoted talks @xcite and are rather interesting .",
    "a remarkable thing is that the peak positions for @xmath23 , @xmath24 production seem to be reversed in @xcite than predicted , and in @xcite they seem to be angle dependent , with opposite trends at forward and backward angles .",
    "the new experimental information obtained calls for a theoretical revival of the theory to the light of the findings made in chiral unitary approaches in the last decade . at stake",
    "are issues like the nature of the @xmath0 resonance , the existence of the two @xmath0 resonances for which experimental evidence has been claimed @xcite , and the possibility that the i=1 amplitude , which is clearly visible in the different @xmath23 , @xmath24 cross sections , could be of resonant character , evidencing a new @xmath25 resonance around 1400 mev , for which hints were seen in @xcite .",
    "recent claims for this resonance have been made in @xcite from the study of the @xmath26 reaction .",
    "this is a very novel development since , as we shall see , some of the high mass baryon resonances can be represented like bound states of vector mesons and baryons , either from the octet of stable baryons or the decuplet .",
    "we follow the formalism of the hidden gauge interaction for vector mesons of @xcite ( see also @xcite for a practical set of feynman rules ) .",
    "the lagrangian involving the interaction of vector mesons amongst themselves is given by @xmath27 where the symbol @xmath28 stands for the trace in the @xmath29 space and @xmath30 is given by @xmath31\\ , \\label{vmunu}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is @xmath33 , with @xmath34 mev the pion decay constant .",
    "the magnitude @xmath35 is the ordinary @xmath29 matrix of the vectors of the octet of the @xmath6    the lagrangian @xmath36 gives rise to a contact term coming from @xmath37[v_\\mu , v_\\nu]$ ] , as well as to a three vector vertex @xmath38    in this case one finds an analogy to the coupling of vectors to pseudoscalars given in the same theory by @xmath39v^{\\nu}\\rangle \\ ,",
    "\\label{lagrvpp}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the su(3 ) matrix of the pseudoscalar fields .    in a similar way",
    ", one obtains the lagrangian for the coupling of vector mesons to the baryon octet given by @xcite @xmath41\\rangle + \\langle \\bar{b}\\gamma_{\\mu}b \\rangle \\langle v^{\\mu}\\rangle \\right ) \\label{lagr82}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is now the ordinary su(3 ) matrix of the baryon octet    with these ingredients we can construct the feynman diagrams that lead to the @xmath43 and @xmath44 interaction , by exchanging a vector meson between the pseudoscalar or the vector meson and the baryon , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] .        from the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn](a ) , and under the low energy approximation of neglecting @xmath45 in the propagator of the exchanged vector , where @xmath4 is the momentum transfer , one obtains the same amplitudes as obtained from the ordinary chiral lagrangian for pseudoscalar - baryon octet interaction , namely the weinberg - tomozawa terms .",
    "the approximation of neglecting the three momenta of the vectors implies that @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ lcont ] ) corresponds to the exchanged vector and the analogy with eq .",
    "( [ lagrvpp ] ) is more apparent .",
    "note that @xmath47 becomes @xmath48 and the signs of the lagrangians also agree .",
    "a small amendment is in order in the case of vector mesons , which is due to the mixing of @xmath49 and the singlet of su(3 ) , @xmath50 , to give the physical states of the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 mesons .",
    "the practical rule is simple and can be found in @xcite . upon the approximation consistent with neglecting the three momentum versus the mass of the particles ( in this case the baryon )",
    ", we can just take the @xmath53 component of eq .",
    "( [ lagr82 ] ) and then the transition potential corresponding to the diagram of [ fig : feyn](b ) is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the energies of the incoming and outgoing vector meson .",
    "the @xmath56 coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) can also be found in @xcite , where one can see that the cases with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the last two corresponding to exotic channels , have a repulsive interaction and do not produce poles in the scattering matrices . however , the sectors @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are attractive and one finds bound states and resonances in these cases .",
    "the scattering matrix is obtained solving the coupled channels bethe salpeter equation in the on shell factorization approach of @xcite @xmath64^{-1}\\ , v \\label{eq : bethe}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 being the loop function of a vector meson and a baryon .",
    "this function is convoluted with the spectral function of the vector mesons to take into account their width as done in @xcite .    in this case",
    "the factor @xmath66 , appearing in the potential @xmath67 , factorizes also in the @xmath68 matrix for the external vector mesons .",
    "this trivial spin structure is responsible for having degenerate states with spin - parity @xmath69 for the interaction of vectors with the octet of baryons and @xmath70 for the interaction of vectors with the decuplet of baryons .",
    "what we have done here for the interaction of vectors with the octet of baryons can be done for the interaction of vectors with the decuplet of baryons , and the interaction is obtained directly from that of the pseudoscalar - decuplet of baryons studied in @xcite .",
    "the study of this interaction in @xcite leads also to the generation of many resonances which are described below .",
    "we search for poles in the scattering matrices in the second riemann sheet , as defined in previous works @xcite .      in table",
    "[ tab : pdg ] we show a summary of the results obtained from the interaction of vectors with the octet of baryons @xcite and the tentative association to known states @xcite .",
    ".the properties of the 9 dynamically generated resonances and their possible pdg counterparts . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also can see that in many cases the experiment shows the near degeneracy predicted by the theory .",
    "particularly , the case of the three @xmath5 resonances around 1920 mev is very interesting .",
    "one observes a near degeneracy in the three spins @xmath70 , as the theory predicts .",
    "it is also very instructive to recall that the case of the @xmath71 is highly problematic in quark models since it has a @xmath72 excitation and comes out always with a very high mass @xcite .",
    "the association of states found to some resonances reported in the pdg for the case of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 states looks also equally appealing as one can see from the table .",
    "the reasonable results reported here produced by the hidden gauge approach should give a stimulus to search experimentally for the missing spin partners of the already observed states , as well as possible new ones .",
    "there are two specific talks on this issue in the workshop @xcite .",
    "i will summarize a bit the important findings in this area by different groups . in @xcite",
    "a formalism was developed to study faddeev equations of systems of two mesons and a stable baryon .",
    "the interaction of the pairs was obtained from the chiral unitary approach , which proves quite successful to give the scattering amplitudes of meson - meson and meson - baryon systems in the region of energies of interest to us .",
    "the spectacular finding is that , leaving apart the roper resonance , whose structure is far more elaborate than originally thought @xcite , all the low lying @xmath76 excited states are obtained as bound states or resonances of two mesons and one baryon in coupled channels .    particularly relevant to this conference",
    "is the issue of a possible bound state of @xmath77 . in @xcite , using variational methods , the authors found a bound state of @xmath77 , with the @xmath78 being in the @xmath79 state @xcite .",
    "the system was studied a posteriori in @xcite and it was found to appear at the same energy and the same configuration , although with a mixture of @xmath80 , see fig .",
    "[ threebody ] .",
    "this state appears around 1920 mev with @xmath76 . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "some arguments were given to associate this state with the bump that one sees in the @xmath2 reaction around this energy , which is clearly visible in recent accurate experiments @xcite .",
    "if this association was correct there would be other experimental consequences , as an enhanced strength of the @xmath81 cross section close to threshold , as well as a shift of strength close to the @xmath78 threshold in the invariant mass distribution of the kaon pair .",
    "this experiment is right now under study @xcite .",
    "another suggestion of @xcite is to measure the total @xmath22 spin @xmath82 and @xmath83 amplitudes , the @xmath84-direction along the photon momentum , since this would discriminate the cases where the peak around 1920 mev is due to a @xmath1 or a @xmath85 resonance .     in the @xmath86 channels . ]",
