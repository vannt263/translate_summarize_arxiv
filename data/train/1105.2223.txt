    "the quark and gluon substructure of the hadrons is ruled by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and it is reflected in the baryon sector by a set of bumps in the cross sections of different probing processes , taken as functions of the center of mass energy @xmath10 .",
    "these bumps are identified as baryon resonances characterized by spin , isospin , orbital angular momentum , radial excitation and parity quantum numbers .",
    "the lowest energy bump , the @xmath11 baryon , is clearly isolated from the background as a state of spin and isospin 3/2 and positive parity . heavier resonances are not so clearly isolated from the background .",
    "this happens in the so called second resonance region , where the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances show up .",
    "although in quark models these resonances can be described as three - quark systems confined by a potential like the harmonic oscillator potential @xcite , some properties , like their decay width , can be better understood within a dynamical meson - baryon coupled - channel reaction model . also , in constituent",
    "quark models the baryon spectrum is difficult to interpret since the negative parity partner of the nucleon , the @xmath2 state ( @xmath15 ) is lighter than the first radial excitation of the nucleon ( @xmath16 ) , the roper ( or @xmath17 state ) @xcite .",
    "it was only recently that lattice qcd simulations with very small pion masses @xcite , reconstructed the natural order of the baryon spectrum ( where the @xmath2 state is heavier than the @xmath17 state ) , suggesting a fundamental role of the quark - antiquark polarization , or meson cloud dressing , in the baryon systems , as a correction to the valence quark effects .",
    "in this work we will use the notation @xmath1 to represent the @xmath14 nucleon excitation ( @xmath18 ) , and we will focus on the electromagnetic structure of this resonance , in particular on the calculation of the @xmath0 transition form factors , within a covariant constituent quark model .",
    "precise data for the @xmath0 amplitudes is available at present @xcite . besides being one of the lightest nucleon resonances ,",
    "the @xmath1 baryon is particularly interesting for several reasons : it is very well isolated in the spin 1/2 and negative parity configuration ; it decays strongly to the @xmath19 channel ( with a branching ratio @xmath20 50% ) , allowing a very precise determination of the electromagnetic structure , and providing therefore an extra challenge for theoretical models . also , because of the strong coupling with the @xmath21 channel ( with a branching ratio @xmath22 50% ) , the @xmath1 is crucial for the analysis of meson photoproduction from the nucleon @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of the @xmath1 is its vicinity to another @xmath2 resonance with higher mass , the @xmath23 also called as @xmath24 .",
    "the two resonances differ in their decay modes , and the differences in their structure is yet to be explored .",
    "several formalisms have been used to describe the @xmath1 system .",
    "they are based either on quark models or on effective meson - baryon interaction models . in the first case , there are non - relativistic constituent quark models @xcite , relativistic quark models @xcite , quark models with explicit quark - antiquark contributions @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the second case , the @xmath1 is interpreted as a molecular - type state dynamically generated by the meson - nucleon interaction @xcite with a particular dominance of the @xmath25 quasi - bound state @xcite .",
    "a particular class of effective meson - baryon interaction models are the dynamical coupled - channel reaction models @xcite , where the baryon bare core is parametrized phenomenologically and the meson dressing is included non perturbatively .",
    "thus @xmath1 does not only provide a crucial test for the methods just mentioned , but it is also a crucial resonant structure for the analysis of nucleon excitation reactions @xcite .    within a constituent quark model picture ,",
    "the nucleon excitation @xmath1 can be represented as a mixture of two different configurations .",
    "since the @xmath2 excitation has total angular momentum @xmath26 and orbital angular @xmath27 ( @xmath28 state excitation ) , its core spin may be either @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "then , in the usual spectroscopic notation @xcite , the @xmath2 channel of the nucleon excitation is a mixture of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states , which have spin 1/2 and 3/2 respectively .",
    "this mixture of the two core spin components is defined by a mixing angle @xmath33 determined by a color hyperfine interaction between the quarks , which may have distinct origins : one - gluon - exchange @xcite , one - pion - exchange @xcite or goldstone - boson - exchange @xcite . in the classical isgur - karl model",
    "it turns out that the spin core spin 1/2 component dominates in the @xmath1 , with a mixing angle given by @xmath34 @xcite .    in our work",
    ", we apply the covariant spectator quark model , which is based on the covariant spectator theory @xcite , to the @xmath1 system .",
    "the model describes the nucleon @xcite , the roper @xcite , the @xmath35 and the @xmath36 @xcite experimental form factors , as well as the lattice qcd simulations for the nucleon , the @xmath37 transition , and the baryon decuplet @xcite . in our framework",
    "the baryons are represented as a quark - diquark system .",
    "the quark couples to the electromagnetic field by means of a constituent quark current which is parametrized by vector meson dominance , and the diquark is a spectator during the electromagnetic interaction , and therefore is taken on - mass - shell @xcite .",
    "the model is phenomenological since it does not derive the structure of the baryon from a dynamical wave function equation . instead",
    ", the baryon systems are described effectively in terms of their intrinsic properties ( spin , flavor , angular orbital momentum and parity )  which dictate the form of their wave function  and the experimental value of their mass @xmath38 . as in the previous applications of the model , in particular to the @xmath39 and the roper resonances , we are focused on the role of the valence quarks for the electromagnetic transition .",
    "because of this and also as a consequence of the kinematics ( the difference of mass between the @xmath1 and the nucleon is 0.60 gev ) our model can only be applied to the high @xmath9 region . as we will show , the domain of validity of our calculations can even be established more precisely and quantitatively , as the region @xmath3 gev@xmath4 . in this region",
    "the meson cloud effects are expected to be small and valence quark degrees to dominate .",
    "we use two additional assumptions : i ) the @xmath1 is represented exclusively by the spin 1/2 core [ no mixture with the @xmath24 excitation ] ii ) the diquark is pointlike . with these assumptions , and",
    "taking the momentum distribution of the diquark the same as for the nucleon , we relate the nucleon and the @xmath1 wave functions .",
    "these assumptions allow us to reduce the number of degrees of freedom to a minimum , since no additional parameters to the ones taken for the nucleon case are needed to describe the spin 3/2 core contributions , or the diquark internal structure .",
    "our results are then true predictions , with no new adjustable parameters .",
    "all parameters were fixed in the previous applications by the quark current and nucleon wave function , represented as s - wave system .",
    "both assumptions can be tested in the future , once the structure of the nucleon is extended to the inclusion of p- and d - states , which demand in turn a spin 3/2 core and/or diquark with internal p - state structure @xcite .",
    "this work will be organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ secsqm ] we introduce the wave functions of the nucleon and the @xmath1 ( details in appendix [ apwf ] ) . in sec .",

    "when the momentum transfer exceeds the mass of the constituent quarks the electromagnetic excitation requires necessarily a relativistic treatment .",
    "this is one of the reasons for us to use the framework provided by the covariant spectator quark model for baryons @xcite . in this formalism",
    "the baryons are phenomenologically described as constituent quark systems , and the covariant wave function has a form compatible with their symmetry properties ( flavor , spin , orbital angular momentum and parity ) and a totally anti - symmetric color wave function @xcite .      for the nucleon",
    "the s - state approximation was made and the spin , flavor and spatial wave function and is represented by @xcite _ n(p , k)= _ n(p , k ) , [ eqpsin ] where the nucleon and diquark four momenta are @xmath28 and @xmath40 respectively , @xmath41 is a dirac spinor , @xmath42 the diquark polarization vector in the fixed - axis representation @xcite and u^(p)= _ 5 ( ^- ) u(p ) , [ equn ] the spin 1/2 vector spin state [ direct product of states 1 ( diquark ) and 1/2 ( quark ) for a total spin state of 1/2 ] .",
    "@xmath43 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the wave function ( [ eqpsin ] ) is written in terms of the states corresponding to a diquark composed by the quark pair ( 12 ) and the quark 3 .",
    "the isospin functions @xmath44 depend on the isospin projection @xmath45 and are shown in table [ tabisospin ] .",
    "note that the spin-0 ( isospin-0 ) and the spin-1 ( isospin-1 ) states are respectively anti - symmetric and symmetric in the exchange of quarks 1 and 2 .",

    "we have also followed very closely the notation established in refs .",
    "we use @xmath51 to label the @xmath1 mass .",
    "the @xmath1 is defined as the excitation of the nucleon to the state @xmath52 .",
    "this state has the same flavor content and the same spin ( 1/2 ) of the nucleon , but has negative parity .",
    "the negative parity defines a spatial symmetry implied by the excitation of internal relative angular momentum @xmath27 , and requires the presence of p waves at least in one quark pair .",
    "consequently , the spin structure also changes relatively to the one of the nucleon , in order to accommodate a total symmetric form for the flavor - spin - momentum space wave function .    to represent the wave function in a basis of momentum states ,",
    "one decomposes , as usual , the system into a pair of quarks [ or diquark labeled ( 12 ) ] , and a spectator quark [ labeled quark ( 3 ) ] , and one defines the momentum variables corresponding to those diquark and spectator quark sub - systems ( the so - called jacobi momenta ) . if the individual quark momenta are @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , the jacobi momenta are @xmath55 , the relative momentum of the quarks in diquark ( 12 ) , and @xmath56 , the diquark center of mass momentum with with respect to quark ( 3 ) .",
    "the center of mass momentum is @xmath57 .",
    "the momentum states that define our basis to represent the wave function are the eigenvectors of the jacobi momenta @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "they are called @xmath60-type and @xmath61-type states , with mixed symmetry is anti - symmetric for the exchange of quarks 1 and 2 , while the jacobi momentum @xmath58 is symmetric for the same exchange .",
    "the jacobi momenta @xmath59 and @xmath58 eigenvector basis states are therefore anti - symmetric and symmetric , respectively , under that exchange . for another particle exchange @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , those states are , however , states of mixed symmetry . ] .",
    "following the traditional notation ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the labels @xmath61 and @xmath60 are used more generally , i.e. , for combinations and angular momentum projections of momentum states , and also for spin and isospin states , that are , respectively , anti - symmetric and symmetric under the exchange of quarks ( 12 ) .",
    "the starting point for the construction of the flavor - spin - momentum - space wave function is to impose that it is symmetric under the exchange of any pair ( the color part , which is omitted , makes it anti - symmetric at the end , as required ) .",
    "the second step is to write the non relativistic limit of the wave function in terms of @xmath60-type and @xmath61-type mixed - symmetric states , labeled @xmath64 and @xmath65 , that couple orbital states @xmath27 ( in principle in both @xmath59 and @xmath66 jacobi momenta ) with total three - quark spin @xmath29 states , and to multiply them with the adequate flavor states that make the function symmetric .",
    "next , we assume a pointlike diquark . in this approximation , effectively , one has @xmath67 . with this suppression of the diquark internal p states ,",
    "the orbital wave function is reduced to p - states in the momentum @xmath58 of the quark - diquark motion only .",
    "additionally , the non relativistic wave function is calculated in the 3 body center of mass frame , where @xmath68 , and the diquark three momentum becomes @xmath69 .",
    "then , the spin - orbital part of the non - relativistic wave function is , in our approximation , written as a function of @xmath70 only .",
    "finally , one makes the relativistic generalization of the coupled spin - orbital states @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding relativistic states , labeled respectively @xmath73 and @xmath74 , include a @xmath75 matrix , exhibiting the negative parity of the state explicitly .",
    "all the details concerning the full non - relativistic wave function in the pointlike diquark limit , and its relativistic generalization , are presented in appendix [ apwf ] . to conclude this section , we write in the pointlike diquark approximation , the final expression for the covariant structure of the spin - flavor - orbital wave function of the @xmath1 .",

    "our results are however in good agreement with the estimations of the ebac group of the quark core contribution to the @xmath6 form factor near @xmath208 gev@xmath4 .",
    "these two last points suggest that our failure in describing @xmath6 is caused by a large negative contribution from the meson cloud which cancels almost exactly the valence quark contribution .",
    "although meson cloud contributions are expected to decrease with increasing @xmath9 , there are some exceptions to that rule , as the observed for the @xmath37 quadrupole transition form factors @xcite , where pion cloud are in fact the dominant effect .",
    "the other possible explanation for the failure of our model in the description of the @xmath6 , is the internal structure of the diquark which was not considered here . but",
    "this explanation is excluded by the comparison of our results with the ebac result , which seems to indicate that the pointlike diquark approximation is apparently good , at least for @xmath5 .",
    "a true test of the @xmath6 suppression can come from the extraction of the core contributions by ebac model for higher @xmath9 , planned for a near future @xcite , and which can confirm our results for the valence quark contributions .",
    "that test will also be useful to assert and consolidate our @xmath5 results .",
    "a third independent test can be the direct comparison with lattice qcd simulations , particularly for large pion masses ( say @xmath209 gev ) , a regime where quark - antiquark ( @xmath203 and @xmath202 cloud ) contributions are believed to be very small .",
    "lattice qcd simulations are nowadays viable since they were performed previously for the @xmath37 and @xmath210 reactions @xcite . although the comparison of phenomenological model results , at the physical pion mass point , with lattice qcd can be problematic due to the necessity of extrapolating to the physical limit , that is not a problem for the spectator quark model : it is based on a vector meson dominance parametrization of the current , and therefore can be extended successfully to the lattice conditions , as was shown for the nucleon @xcite and roper @xcite reactions , for the @xmath37 transition @xcite and also for the baryon decuplet form factors @xcite .",
    "in addition to the form factors , we calculated as well the helicity amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 . as in our calculations the violation of the orthogonality condition between the initial and final states , gives @xmath211 , implying that the amplitude @xmath8 diverges for @xmath212 and the results for @xmath6 differ from the data , we conclude that helicity amplitudes are not the more convenient representation to test our model in particular , and quark models in general .",
    "combining our results with the hypothesis that @xmath6 is negligible , because of the actual cancellation of valence quark contributions and meson cloud contributions , which is suggested by the successful comparison of the our results and the ebac quark core contribution , we obtain an excellent description of the helicity amplitudes data , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see dashed line in fig .
