    "@xmath45 , which is the sphere @xmath46 ( or any sphere @xmath47 as long as @xmath48 is a positive constant ) .",

    "now reflection about any line in the plane of the triangles has the effect @xmath57 so that the upper hemisphere @xmath58 of the shape sphere @xmath46 , realizes the space of similarity classes of triangles , with its boundary @xmath40 representing the degenerate collinear triangles .",

    "we can identify this quotient projection with the shape projection @xmath79 composed with the radial projection @xmath80 from the shape space minus the origin onto a shape sphere .",
    "the riemannian submersion property implies that geodesics for @xmath75 which are orthogonal to the @xmath81-fibers project project onto geodesics for the quotient metric .",

    "i teach a geometry class nearly every year for an audience consisting primarily of future high school mathematics teachers .",
    "i feel an obligation to teach the rudiments of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "but almost all the students leave the class with no understanding of what the hyperbolic plane is beyond a vague sense that `` things get really tiny and squinched together when you approach the x - axis '' .",
    "the present paper began as an attempt to provide a natural road in to hyperbolic geometry and its intuition for these students .",
    "i believe i have failed .",
    "nevertheless i hope some readers find the exercise was interesting .    the papers @xcite and @xcite combined to suggest the approach taken here to building the `` mechanical hyperbolic metric '' of theorem 1 .",
    "in @xcite i applied the reductions of the present paper to the `` strong - force '' @xmath105 potential @xmath106 in the equal mass three - body case to obtain a metric on the shape sphere minus its three binary collision points , i.e. on the topologist s pair - of - pants .",
    "the main theorem there is that this metric is complete with negative gauss curvature everywhere except at two points ( the equilateral triangles of lagrange ) . as a corollary ,",
    "the figure eight solution for that potential is unique up to isometry and scaling . in @xcite , connor jackman and i tried to extend the @xmath107 hyperbolicity to the case @xmath108 body problem with equal masses .",
    "the potential has the same form @xmath109 , except the sum is now taken over all 6 pairs amongst the 4 bodies .",
    "connor proved that the results of @xcite do not readily extend : the resulting 4-body jm metric has mixed curvature : some 2-planes have positive curvature , some negative .",
    "the tricks we applied in @xcite , @xcite and the present paper apply to any galilean - invariant potential of homogeneity @xmath28 on the n - body configuration space @xmath110 , provided that potential @xmath27 is negative ( possibly @xmath111 ) .",
    "the result is a metric on @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the set on which @xmath114 . that jm metric has the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "reflecting on the jump from n = 3 to n=4 in jumping from @xcite to @xcite , it is natural to wonder what might happen when we take such a jump for our `` 3-point '' potential ( [ potential ] ) . to define the analogous n - body potential we sum our 3-point potential over all triples of bodies",
    "thus , consider n point masses in the plane , labeling them @xmath117 . for",
    "each choice of 3 indices @xmath118 out of @xmath119 , let @xmath120 be the moment of inertia of the triangle formed by vertices @xmath121 and let @xmath122 be the signed area of this triangle . then the n - body analogue of our potential is @xmath123 the sum being over all three - element subsets @xmath124 .",
    "we observe that the singularity of @xmath125 is precisely the set @xmath126 of all  non - generic planar n - gons , where we say that an n - gon is non - generic if some 3 of its vertices are collinear .",
    "@xmath126 is a real codimension 1 subvariety which cuts the configuration space into a number of components .",
    "* question 1 . * for @xmath108 is the resulting jm metric on @xmath127 hyperbolic ?",
    ".3 cm one computes without much difficulty that this jm metric is complete .",
    "indeed , near any typical point of @xmath126 we can choose a coordinate @xmath93 such that @xmath40 locally defines @xmath113 and the jm metric as @xmath128 has leading asymptotics that of the hyperbolic metric : @xmath129 .",
    "there are restrictions on the topology of complete hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "if the manifold is simply connected then it must be diffeomorphic to the ball in that dimension .",
    "this suggests looking into the topology of @xmath127 .",
    "we have verified that @xmath127 consists of 14 components , and that each one of which is diffeomorphic to @xmath130 , providing weak circumstantial evidence that the answer might be `` yes '' to question 1 .",
    "jumping further ahead to higher @xmath131 :    * question 2 .",
    "* how many components are there in the space @xmath132 of general position planar",
    "n - gons ? is each component diffeomorphic to an open ball of dimension @xmath133 ?",
    ".3 cm    * question 3 . *",
    "do potentials of the form of eq ( [ potential ] ) arise in any physical or chemical problems of interest ?",
