    "magnetically tunable feshbach resonances have opened up a new field of research in the physics of ultracold atomic gases that exhibits exciting phenomena . in two - component fermi gases , for instance , the condensate of atom pairs in the bcs - bec crossover regime has been intensively studied  @xcite . in an ultracold atomic system ,",
    "the _ p_-wave feshbach resonance was also found , which allows one to tune _ p_-wave interactions between atoms in the spin - polarized fermi system  @xcite .",
    "it has now become possible to produce @xmath0-wave molecules between @xmath1k atoms using this technique  @xcite .",
    "atomic boson - fermion mixed systems , too , are expected to show many interesting phenomena . in this mixed system , it has been reported the observation of simultaneous quantum degeneracy of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and degenerate fermi gas  @xcite , and the collapse of fermions in the attractively interacting mixture  @xcite . on the theoretical side a number of studies on the static and dynamical properties of the mixture have been made  @xcite .",
    "we note here that the strongly coupled boson - fermion pair may behave as a heteronuclear molecule or resonance , and its role in the mixture has been studied  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show an existence of the feshbach resonances between bosons and fermions  @xcite , and quite recently a formation of the boson - fermion heteronuclear molecule in the optical lattice has been reported  @xcite . as in the case of fermionic system ,",
    "the existence of the feshbach resonance allows one to control the boson - fermion interaction  @xcite . tuning the interaction one",
    "may induce a collapse of fermions or a phase separation of bosons and fermions , depending on the sign of the interaction  @xcite . in many experiments of atomic bose - fermi mixture ,",
    "all atomic fermions have the same spin components as they are trapped by magneto - optical trap together with bosons .",
    "the fermion - fermion interaction has been negligible since the _ s_-wave scattering amplitude between fermions vanishes because of pauli exclusion principle , and the other higher partial waves do not contribute at low temperatures . in a boson - fermion mixed system , boson density fluctuations may give rise to an attractive interaction between fermions as in the electron - phonon system , and may induce a superfluid transition  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been studied in the liquid @xmath2-@xmath3 mixtures  @xcite . if this mechanism is strong enough in the ultracold atomic mixture , _",
    "p_-wave cooper pairs will be formed between spin - polarized fermions  @xcite .",
    "we should note , however , that a realization of the superfluid depends on a balance of different mechanisms as mentioned above . a sufficiently strong attractive boson - fermion interaction , for instance , may cause a collapse of the system rather than the superfluid state . on the other hand ,",
    "a strong boson - fermion repulsion may favor a phase separation of bosons and fermions instead of the superfluid transition .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate a possibility of _ p_-wave superfluid transition in the repulsively interacting spin - polarized bose - fermi mixture at zero temperature .",
    "we consider superfluid transition induced by a bogoliubov phonon - mediated fermion - fermion interaction , and compare energies of the @xmath0-wave superfluid state and the boson - fermion phase - separated state . in view of the recent development in the tuning of boson - fermion interaction via feshbach resonances , we study the system in a broad range of the interaction parameters .",
    "earlier study in this direction shows that the _ p_-wave superfluid transition is hard to occur , i.e. , its transition temperature is too low to be attainable , because the phonon - mediated attractive interaction is very weak  @xcite .",
    "a stronger repulsive interaction would cause an instability of the system towards phase separation , and then the induced attractive interaction reduces .",
    "we show , however , that for a very strong repulsive interaction it is possible to realize the _ p_-wave superfluid transition . in the superfluid phase",
    ", anisotropic energy gap appears like that of _ p_-wave superfluid of @xmath4he and heavy - fermion systems .",
    "we also show that the cooper pair is a tightly bound state like a diatomic molecule in the strong boson - fermion coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "main content of the present paper is as follows .",

    "the elastic fermion - fermion @xmath20-wave scattering for spin - polarized fermions is absent because of pauli exclusion principle .    in order to give a realistic estimate of the phase diagram",

    "we regard the first term of eq.([effectivebf ] ) as an energy shift of the fermionic chemical potential @xmath36 . by applying the second - order perturbation theory ,",

    "the effective hamiltonian of fermions is then given by @xmath43 since we consider spin - polarized fermions , the effective interaction in the channel with even angular momentum @xmath44 is absent due to antisymmetrization of the orbital wave function in the relative coordinate .",
