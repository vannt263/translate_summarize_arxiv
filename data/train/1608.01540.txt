    "the no envy test ( @xcite , @xcite ) captures the powerful fairness principle that participants of a given allocation problem should be given equal opportunities .",
    "when we divide heterogenous private commodities in the common property regime it eschews interpersonal comparison of utilities and is logically related to the concept of competitive exchange .",
    "if the agents have arrow - debreu ( in particular , convex ) preferences over the goods to divide , there is at least one _ competitive equilibrium _ allocation where all agents have _ equal incomes _ ( for short ceei , or simply _ competitive _ , allocation ) , and this allocation is both efficient and envy - free .",
    "the implementation of the elegant competitive division rule in user - friendly platforms like spliddit or adjusted winner asks visitors to report simple preferences .",
    "this has two advantages , one practical and the other conceptual .    on the practical side ,",
    "we divide for instance the family heirlooms by asking each participant to distribute 100 points over the different items , and interpret these bids  as fixed marginal rates of substitution ; in other words we force the report of _ linear preferences . _",
    "eliciting complex complementarities between the different objects is a complex task with 6 objects , an outright impossible one with 10 or more so we deliberately ignore that aspect of preferences .. the proof of the pudding is in the eating : hundreds of visitors use these sites every month , fully aware of the interpretation of their bids ( @xcite ) .    on the conceptual side ,",
    "the competitive allocation of goods under additive utilities is remarkably ( almost unreasonably so , say @xcite ) well behaved : it maximizes the ( nash ) product of individual utilities over all feasible allocations , hence it is unique utility - wise , easily computed , and continuous in the marginal utility rates .",
    "it is natural to expect that the competitive approach to fair division is equally successful for the division of bads  and of goods : just like labor as time not spent on leisure , a simple change of viewpoint turns ` bads ' into ` goods ' .",
    "surprisingly , this is not the case at all : we show here that even the implementation of the much more permissive no envy test is a formidable challenge when we divide bads .",
    "this is important because many practical fair division problems involve _ bads _ ( non disposable items generating disutility ) : workers distributing tasks ( house chores , job shifts among substitutable workers ( @xcite ) like teaching loads , babysitting , etc . ) , cities sharing noxious facilities , managers allocating cuts in the company s workforce between their respective units , and so on .",
    "of course the division of _ goods _ has many applications as well : the family heirlooms ( @xcite ) , the assets of divorcing partners ( @xcite ) , office space between the colleagues , seats in overdemanded business school courses ( @xcite , @xcite ) , computing resources in peer - to - peer platforms ( @xcite ) , and so on .",
    "the sharp difference between goods and bads is especially clear under linear preferences , because the two models are formally identical : preferences are described by a list of marginal rates interpreted as the marginal _ utilities _ for goods , or _",
    "disutilities _ for bads .",
    "the competitive allocations ( efficient and envy - free as usual ) exist when we share _ bads _ , however there are routinely several of them with different welfare consequences . here",
    "is why : eating @xmath0 units of bad @xmath1 is the same as consuming @xmath2 units of the good @xmath3 , not eating @xmath1 ; however each agent can consume at most @xmath4 unit of the good @xmath3 , of which we have @xmath5 units to distribute among @xmath6 agents .",
    "it is well known that such constraints on individual consumption ( sometimes interpreted as satiation of preferences ) can enlarge considerably the set of competitive equilibria .    in the following example with two agents and three bads:@xmath7 efficiency",
    "means that if agent @xmath4 eats ( consumes a positive amount of ) bad @xmath0 and agent @xmath8 eats some bad @xmath9 , the letter @xmath0 is alphabetically before @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "we have no less than _ _  five _ _ competitive allocations , reaching both ends of the envy - free and efficient set . at the worst competitive allocation @xmath11 for agent @xmath4",
    ", she gets her _ fair share _",
    "disutility @xmath12 ( as if she consumes half of each bad ) and @xmath13 is competitive for the prices @xmath14 ( normalized so that total cost of all objects is @xmath8 and each agent has a budget of @xmath4 ) .",
    "symmetrically the worst efficient and envy - free allocation @xmath15 for agent @xmath8 gives him his fair share disutility @xmath16 . in two more competitive allocations the bads",
    "are not split : in @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) agent @xmath4 gets @xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) and agent @xmath8 gets @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) ; in the fifth allocation @xmath22 they split @xmath23 . with prices @xmath24 and @xmath25 with prices @xmath26 . ]",
    "note that this pattern is robust to small changes in the disutility matrix .",
    "if @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . ]    in general the number of competitive disutility profiles can grow exponentially in the smallest of the number of bads and of agents ( proposition 3 ) .",
    "there is no obvious way to deal with this embarrassing multiplicity .",
    "the news is worse when we turn to no envy , a much weaker fairness test than the competitive one .",
    "it turns out that with three or more agents , the set of efficient and envy - free allocations of bads , and the corresponding disutility profiles , can have up to roughly @xmath31 connected components among @xmath6 agents : see proposition 4 and a four - agent two - bad example with three such components in section 5 .",
    "it follows that any single - valued , efficient and envy - free division rule , in particular any selection of the competitive allocations , must be discontinuous in the disutility rates ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "the no envy property is the central concept of the equal opportunity approach to fair division : its implementation for the division of bads requires either to allow inefficient allocations , or tolerate significant jumps in individual welfare from minute differences in the disutility matrix .",
    "our second impossibility result pits two staples of the fair division literature against each other .",
    "_ resource monotonicity _ ( rm ) is a solidarity requirement in the common property regime : when the pile of goods ( resp .",
    "bads ) to divide increases ( resp .",
    "decreases ) , everyone should benefit at least weakly . beyond the fair division of private goods , rm has been applied to a broad range of resource allocation problems with production and/or indivisibilities .",
    "_ fair share guarantee _ ( fsg ) says that nobody should end up worse off than by eating @xmath32-th of each good , or of each bad . this simple welfare lower bound , much weaker than no envy in our model , is probably the least controversial fairness requirement in the literature ; like rm it can be adapted to many other fair division contexts involving production and/or indivisibilities ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    our second surprising contrast goods versus bads",
    "is that the competitive division of goods meets rm ( and fsg ) , but no efficient single - valued division of bads meets both rm and fsg : theorem 2 .",
    "resource monotonicity is one more appealing feature of the competitive rule to divide _ goods _ : the linearity of preferences avoids the choice between rm and fsg .",
    "however if we divide bads , the incompatibility is back with a vengeance .",
    "we conclude that , even in the benchmark domain of additive utilities , identifying a reasonable efficient division rule is as difficult for bads as it is easy for goods .    [",

    "they are characterized by systems of first order conditions identical up to a sign switch ( lemma 2 ) , and are both related to the nash product of utilities or disutilities ( proposition 1 ) ; they are both characterized by a single property that we call _ independence of lost bids _",
    "( ilb ) : proposition 2 .",
    "proposition 3 gives some estimates on the number of competitive allocations of bads different welfare - wise , even precise ones for problems with two agents and/or two bads .",
    "section 5 turns to efficient and envy - free allocations of bads : their set can have as many as @xmath33 connected components ( proposition 4 ) , which implies theorem 1 , our main impossibility result .",
    "our second negative result , theorem 2 , is the object of section 6 .",
    "most proofs are in section 7 .",
    "-0.5 cm 1 .",
    "our main motivation is the recent stream of work in algorithmic mechanism design ( and its computational social choice  subfield ) on fair division of _ goods_. it recognizes the practical convenience of additive utilities and the conceptual advantages of the competitive solution .",
    "for instance in the same model as here , megiddo and vazirani ( @xcite ) show that the competitive utility profile depends continuously upon the rates of substitution and the total endowment ; jain and vazirani ( @xcite ) that it is can be computed in time polynomial in the dimension @xmath34 of the problem .",
    "steinhaus 1948 cake - division  model ( @xcite ) , assumes linear preferences represented by atomless measures over , typically , a compact euclidian set .",
    "it contains our model for goods as the special case where the measures are piecewise constant .",
    "sziklai and segal - halevi ( @xcite ) show that it preserves the equivalence of the competitive rule and the nash product maximizer , and that this rule is resource monotonic ( see the remark in section 6 ) .",
    "the fair division of _ indivisible _ _ goods _ with additive utilities is a variant of the standard model where the maximization of the nash product still defines a very attractive solution : it loses its competitive interpretation and becomes hard to compute ( @xcite ) , however it is envy - free up to at most one object  ( caragianis et al .",
    "@xcite ) and can be efficiently approximated ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally budish ( @xcite ) approximates the competitive allocation in problems with a large number of copies of several good - types by means of a little flexibility in the number of available copies .",
    "four decades earlier the microeconomic literature on the fair division of private goods worked in the much larger domain of arrow - debreu preferences , where the relation between the nash product of utilities and the competitive rule is lost , and provided several axiomatic characterizations of the latter .",
    "the most popular result appears first in hurwicz * *  * * ( @xcite ) and gevers ( @xcite ) , and is refined by thomson * *  * * ( @xcite ) and nagahisa ( @xcite ) : any efficient and pareto indifferent rule meeting ( some variants of ) maskin monotonicity ( mm ) must contain the competitive rule .",
    "our independence of lost bids is in fact a weak variant of mm for the linear domain , so that the proof of our proposition 2 follows the standard argument .",
    "the point is that the classic characterization extends to the model with bads .",
    "\\3 . in the arrow - debreu preference domain",
    "the competitive allocation of goods is not resource monotonic .",
    "in fact no efficient single - valued division of _ goods _ can meet both fsg and rm : @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the incompatibility is easy to check for two agents with leontief preferences over two goods . in view of our theorem 2 ,",
    "much remains to understand about domain of preferences where the incompatibility disappears .",
