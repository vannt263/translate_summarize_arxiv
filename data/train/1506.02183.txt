    "have also u and d quarks content their inside , it is expected that their parameters are also affected by the medium . the investigation of hyperons in nuclear medium and the comparison of the results with the nucleons can helps us to determine the order of @xmath4 violation in medium .",
    "the predictions of the scalar and vector self - energies of these particles can also provide valuable information on the scalar and vector in - medium couplings of these particles .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study the self - energies of the @xmath1 hyperon in nuclear medium using the finite - density qcd sum rules .",
