    "note that as @xmath98 increases , the effect of the nonzero temperature is less and less pronounced .",
    "according to the previous discussion , one can conclude that as the temperature increases , the ratio @xmath110 goes from the value @xmath106 at low temperatures to @xmath101 at high temperatures .",

    "in this work , we have examined the characteristic times which describe the low frequency dynamics of the mesoscopic capacitors . by combining the delayed - deformed current picture and the numerical calculations within negf formalism",
    ", we found that the wigner - smith delay time @xmath0 can only capture the ac response of the mesoscopic capacitor up to the second order of the frequency . at higher frequencies ,",

    "the deformation time indicates that due to the scattering , the profile of the outgoing current from the dot is distorted from the incoming one . at sufficient low temperatures when",
    "the charge transport is phase - coherent , @xmath1 can be approximated from the wigner - smith delay time @xmath0 via a simple relation @xmath2 . at high temperatures when the coherence is broken ,",
    "one has instead @xmath3 .",
    "hence this relation can be regarded as a signature of the ac quantum coherent transport .",
    "we further show that the deformation time @xmath1 can have a pronounced influence on the quantum inductance @xmath4 of the mesoscopic capacitor , making @xmath4 show quite different behaviors from the ones of the quantum capacitor @xmath14 .",
    "the most striking one is that @xmath4 can change its sign as the temperature increases : it goes from positive values at low temperatures to large negative values at high temperatures .",
    "thus the positive definiteness of @xmath4 can also be regarded as a signature of the ac quantum coherent transport .",
