    "the possibility of increasing the performances of interferometers by using quantum light represents one of the most interesting use of quantum states for overcoming classical limits of measurements . the first approach proposed to this aim",
    "is based on exploiting squeezed light for reducing the noise level in interferometers @xcite and found recently application in gravitational waves detectors @xcite .",
    "a second approach is considering the use of entanglement in phase estimation and , in particular , the possibility offered by the use of noon states @xcite .",
    "however , even if this approach presents a significant conceptual interest and could find very interesting applications in the future , nowadays the difficulty in producing high @xmath0 entangled states and the fragility to noise and losses of these schemes strongly limits their real possible use .",
    "more recently , correlation in photon number in two - mode squeezed vacuum or twin - beam state ( twb ) @xcite has been demonstrated to be an important tool for beating shot noise @xcite and for realising a first quantum protocol effectively robust against noise and losses @xcite .",
    "these results prompted to study the possibility of improving the so called `` holometer '' by exploiting quantum light , and in particular squeezed one or twbs @xcite .",
    "the holometer is a double michelson interferometer ( mi ) addressed to detect the so called `` holographic noise '' ( hn ) , namely a basic form of noise conjectured in quantum gravity theories that would derive from a non - commutativity of the spatial degrees of freedom at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "this noise , albeit very small , should be correlated when the two mis are parallel , such to be in the respective light cones , while should be uncorrelated when one arm is rotated to be oriented in the opposite direction for the two mis .",
    "the evident huge impact that the discovery of holographic noise , the first eventual evidence of quantum gravity effects , would present , @xcite motivates an accurate analysis of the possibility of improving the holometer performances . in this paper we detail and complete the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite identifying operative situations where the use of quantum light would allow to greatly increase the performances of a double interferometer like the holometer .",
    "more in detail , in @xcite we investigated an unusual but potentially powerful system consisting of two interferometers whose correlation of output ports signals is measured ( see fig.[scheme ] ) .",
    "this kind of double interferometric system can represent a breakthrough for detecting a faint correlated signal that would remain otherwise hidden even using the most sensitive individual interferometric devices , limited by the shot noise . on the other side",
    "if the two interferometers are in the experience identical fluctuation , this signal should emerge in a correlation measurement of their output , while the fluctuations due to shot noise and other independent contributions will vanish .",
    "the first experimental realization of this scheme using coherent beams ( stabilized lasers ) , exactly for hn detection , is already being implemented at fermilab .",
    "other applications can be envisaged such as for new generation of gravitational wave detectors .    in @xcite",
    "we have introduced a rigorous quantum model for describing the system . as opposed to standard phase measurement in a single interferometer , which involved first order expectation value of the output , in the double interferometric scheme",
    "the quantity under estimation is the covariance of the two outputs , which is a second order quantity , thus the associated uncertainty is a fourth order function . notwithstanding this difference",
    ", we demonstrated how the injection of quantum light at the input ports , which would remain unused in classical holometer configuration , can boost the sensitivity of the device .",
    "in addition to the classical intense coherent beam , we considered both the use of independent squeezed beam ( sqb ) and correlated state such as the twb .",
    "the ideal experiment described theoretically there , is however not suitable for a practical experimental implementation . in particular , the setting of the central phases the two interferometers exactly at @xmath1 which provides the optimal quantum enhancement , is indeed critical , because minimal deviations from this working regime completely compromise the advantages of the quantum strategy .",
    "furthermore , the balanced readout configuration explored in sqb case would require simultaneously high dynamic range , fast and high resolution detectors that are not yet available .",
    "here we present a framework in which a more complete and general study of the double interferometric system is provided , leading also to the depiction of a more experiment - oriented configuration of the system in terms of readout strategy and parameters choice .    in sec .",
    "[ the interferometric scheme ] we present the description of the scheme . in sec .",
    "[ correlations at the read - out ports ] we analyse the correlation properties at the output ports of the interferometer in the case of twb , demonstrating that for a proper choice of the relative phase @xmath2 between the coherent beam and the twb , the energy transfer from the coherent beam due to the mixing allows the generation of either bright quantum correlation ( @xmath3 ) or anti - correlation ( @xmath4 ) in the photon number , as witnessed from the noise reduction factor ( nrf ) value below unity .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that there are two regimes with different behaviour of the system : ( a ) , in which a strict choice of the central phases of the interferometers makes the contribution to the coherent light at the dark port negligible , i.e. only quantum light is detected . in principle",
    "it leads to the optimal correlation ( only bounded by losses ) , but turns out quite challenging in practice , since would require extremely precise stabilization of the interferometers , especially if the coherent beam is intense.(b ) , in which the major component of the signal at the output ports is due to the coherent beam contribution .",
    "this is a more common and realistic working condition .",
    "there is a sudden transition between these two regimes .    in sec .",
    "[ estimation of phase - correlation ( holographic noise ) ] we describe in detail a model establishing the connection between a generic measurement operator ( observable ) and the estimation of the phase - covariance introduced by a correlated faint phase signal such as hn . then , we focus on two specific quantum strategies : either on the use of twb state and the measure of the photons number difference , of the use of two independent squeezed states and the measure of quadratures covariance . in both cases",
    "we evaluate the lower bound to the uncertainty in the phase - covariance - estimation given by photon noise , in function of the fundamental parameters : the interferometers central phases @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , the quantum and classical beam intensities @xmath7 and detection efficiency @xmath8 .",
    "the results are reported in sec .",
    "[ results ] . for rather challenging conditions , namely almost ideal efficiency and perfect control of the stability of the interferometers central phases ( regime ( a ) )",
    ", twb could deliver extraordinary advantage due to its photon number correlation at the quantum level ( entanglement ) .",
    "this regime corresponds to the situation analyzed in @xcite .",
    "conversely , there exists a less demanding regime ( ( b)-regime described before ) , in which quantum strategies provide good enhancement in a more favorable experimental condition . in this case , both for twb and sqb the expression of the minimal uncertainty presents the usual scaling with losses , ( @xmath9 ) , and with the quantum light intensity , ( @xmath10 ) , typical of single phase estimation using strong local oscillator and squeezed light .",

    "two interferometers @xmath11 ( @xmath6 ) are injected at the ports denoted by the mode annihilation operators @xmath12 by a couple of identical coherent beams @xmath13 , while the remaining ports identified by the mode operator @xmath14 ( unused in the classical scheme ) are fed with a quantum state @xmath15 , where @xmath7 is the mean number of photon in each mode .",
    "the readout ports are denoted by the mode operator @xmath16 which will be function of the phases shifts @xmath17 among the arm of each interferometer , @xmath18 .",

    "it also suggests to choose the measurement operator in the same form @xmath35 , since this should correspond to a reduction of the photon noise in the measurement , finally improving the sensitivity .    by using the equivalence between interferometers and bss mentioned before",

    "aside a constant factor , the    uncertainty reduction for @xmath141 behaves as for the two    independent squeezing case , specifically    @xmath163 .",
    "it can be easily appreciated when comparing the corresponding curves    for twb and squeezing in the figures ( taking in to account the    logarithmic scale ) .    for the sake of completeness , we did the same analysis considering to exploit the anti - correlations , defining the observable as @xmath164 ( for @xmath4 ) instead of the correlation when twb are injected , obtaining analogous results in the regime of @xmath165 .",
    "in sec . [ results ] we observed interesting features , leading to promising experimental conditions . referring to fig .",
    "[ uvsphi(eta ) ] and [ uvsphi(lambda ) ] there is an extended range of value of the central working phase @xmath147 of the interferometers in which the uncertainty reduction achievable by adopting quantum light is stable , at the value @xmath166 both with sqb and twb ( a part a factor @xmath167 in the last case ) .",
    "this kind of scaling is a well known results of phase estimation in a single interferometer combining coherent strong field and single mode squeezed light ( in fact @xmath168 in the limit @xmath169 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , it turns out that a measurement of the phase correlation retains the same advantage of the single phase estimation . as an example , for @xmath170 and @xmath162 , compatible with the actual technology , we have 5.7 times of uncertainty reduction in the single measurement . since in any experiments",
    "@xmath171 measurements are performed and the final uncertainty is @xmath172 , one would easily obtain the same sensitivity with a number of runs 30 times smaller , hence reducing the total measurement time of the same amount .    on the other side , only for twb",
    ", there exists a special setting of the central phase of the interferometer , when the classical fields component is made negligible at the read - out ports with respect to the twb component , in which in principle the uncertainty reach the zero point , whatever the intensity of twb .",
    "in particular for faint twb ( @xmath146 ) the uncertainty scales as @xmath160 while for intense twb ( @xmath81 ) one gets @xmath159 . even if at first glance this looks rather exciting , fig .",
    "[ uvseta ] shows that in terms of absolute sensitivity squeezing performance can be overtaken only for rather high detection efficiency .",
    "for example for @xmath162 we expect @xmath173 for @xmath174 . however , for limited quantum resources , namely @xmath175 , twb performs better than squeezing already for smaller and more realistic efficiency values .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have analyzed in detail a system of two interferometers aimed at the detection of extremely faint phase - fluctuation .",
    "the idea behind is that a correlated phase - signal like the one introduced by the `` holographic noise '' could emerge by correlating the output ports of the interferometers , even when in the single interferometer it confounds with the background .",
    "we demonstrated that injecting quantum light in the free ports of the interferometers can reduce the photon noise of the system beyond the shot - noise , enhancing the resolution in the phase - correlation estimation .",
    "our results basically confirms the benefit of using squeezed beams together with strong coherent beams in interferometry , even in this correlated case .",
