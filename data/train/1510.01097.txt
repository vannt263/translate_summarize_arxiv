    "the scattering between an electron and a neutral atom depends on the kinetic energy of the particles @xcite and the relative spin orientation  @xcite .",
    "+ the interaction between the valence electron of a rydberg atom and a ground state atom can be treated as such a scattering problem @xcite since the rydberg electron is very loosely bound to the core .",
    "the arising scattering potential can support bound states and ipso facto , lead to the formation of ultralong - range rydberg molecules  @xcite .",
    "these molecules were first observed in rb for @xmath4-states with the rydberg electron , and ground state atom spins in a triplet configuration @xcite . since",
    "then a variety of exciting phenomena have been explored , such as states bound by quantum reflection @xcite , coherent creation and breaking of the molecular bond @xcite , polyatomic rydberg molecules @xcite , exotic trilobite states @xcite and controlled hybridization of the molecular bond @xcite .",
    "diatomic rydberg molecules were realized for @xmath4-states in cs @xcite and sr @xcite , for @xmath5-states in rb @xcite and for @xmath6-states in rb @xcite and cs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rb@xmath0 rydberg molecules were also used as a probe of the quantum phase transition from the superfluid to the mott - insulator phase @xcite .",
    "+ recently , the existence of rydberg molecules bound by mixed singlet - triplet scattering has been proposed by anderson et al .",
    "@xcite and proven experimentally for cs in zero magnetic field @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present high resolution spectroscopic data of these mixed singlet - triplet molecules , photoassociated from a sub-@xmath7 cloud of @xmath8rb .",
    "the mixing of the singlet and triplet scattering channels is a consequence of the hyperfine interaction of the ground state atom as well as the applied magnetic field .",
    "our data enables the determination of an effective singlet @xmath1-wave scattering length for @xmath8rb from fitting the resulting molecular binding energies .",
    "we also compare our experimental results to a full diagonalization of the scattering hamiltonian using the non - relativistic @xmath9-rb scattering phase shifts from @xcite , providing a high - precision test of the low - energy range of these phase shifts .",
    "we find that in particular the triplet @xmath2-wave contribution significantly affects the binding potentials due to a shape resonance in the electron - neutral collision @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate the magnetic field - induced shift of the mixed - spin molecular states , which we find to be different than that of the asymptotic atomic states .",
    "we show that a transition from the zeeman regime to a paschen - back like regime , where the magnetic field induced energy shifts are large compared to the molecular binding energies , happens already at very small fields of order @xmath10 g for principal quantum numbers @xmath11 .",
    "thus , perturbative treatment of the magnetic field is only applicable for significantly smaller fields @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the theory of rydberg molecules including the ground state hyperfine interaction , which leads to the mixing of singlet and triplet scattering channels @xcite .",
    "we first introduce the hamiltonian of the rydberg - neutral atom system and then explain the two approaches we use to calculate the molecular potentials , namely the effective zero - energy s - wave scattering length approach and an approach using the full diagonalization of the scattering hamiltonian . finally , we present the obtained potential energy curves ( pecs ) and show the importance of the p - wave shape resonance for the mixed singlet - triplet pecs .      within the born - oppenheimer approximation",
    ", we describe the interaction of the rydberg electron with the ground state atom at position @xmath12 in an external magnetic field @xmath13 by using the hamiltonian : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the field - free hamiltonian of the rydberg electron in which the fine structure is included via quantum defects @xcite , @xmath16 accounts for the interaction of the rydberg electron orbital angular momentum and spin , as well as the ground state valence electron spin with the magnetic field and @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the hyperfine interaction of the ground and the rydberg state , respectively .",
    "the last two terms account for the singlet ( @xmath4 ) and triplet ( @xmath19 ) scattering between rydberg electron and ground state atom , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the scattering potentials and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the projection operators , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "the magnetic field term enters the hamiltonian only on the diagonal and shifts the individual levels by the zeeman shift .",
    "the hyperfine interaction of the ground state atom @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the hyperfine constant @xcite , contributes to the diagonal and off - diagonal terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "the rydberg electron - ground state atom scattering enters the hamiltonian ( eq.[eq:1 ] ) via pure singlet @xmath21 and pure triplet @xmath20 scattering potentials on diagonal and off - diagonal positions . eventually , the interplay of all couplings results in a mixing of the molecular states .",

    "the @xmath1-wave scattering operator has non - vanishing matrix elements for states only with @xmath53 , while for the @xmath2-wave scattering only @xmath54 states contribute , greatly reducing the number of basis states .",
    "we diagonalize the scattering hamiltonian ( eq . [ eq:4 ] ) as a function of the distance @xmath12 between the rydberg ionic core and the perturber and obtain the pure singlet and triplet potential energy curves ( pec ) .      finally , we diagonalize the full hamiltonian ( eq . [ eq:1 ] ) restricted to the target state , with the singlet and triplet pec included , at each position @xmath12 of the perturber . in the case of zero magnetic field",

    "the applied magnetic field leads to further changes of the pecs , which is shown in fig.[fig2 ] for an external magnetic field of @xmath13=2.35 g . in the figure",

    "the @xmath59 substate of f=1 also has a non - zero overlap with the state that is excited in the experiment .",
    "however , this overlap is very small and thus this state was not observed in the experiment . the rydberg hyperfine interaction further splits each individual line from fig.[fig2 ] into four lines separated by around 200khz , since the experiment is conducted in a magnetic field in which the zeeman shift of the rydberg states is large compared to their hyperfine splitting @xmath60 @xcite . + subsequently , we solve the schrdinger equation for the nuclear motion in the calculated triplet and mixed potentials using numerov s method to find the bound states .",
    "in order to observe rydberg molecules in the experiment , we prepare a spin polarized atomic sample of approximately 3@xmath61 @xmath8rb atoms , at a temperature below 1@xmath62k , in the magnetically trapped 5@xmath63 , f=2 , m@xmath64=2 state .",
    "we excite the atoms with 20@xmath62s long pulses with a 2khz repetition rate to the @xmath65 rydberg state via a two - photon transition ( fig.[fig1]b ) . the laser polarization and the detuning from the intermediate state",
    "is chosen such that we mainly excite rydberg atoms in the @xmath66 state .",

    "the shaded areas are used to reflect the sensitivity of the calculated binding energies to the chosen boundary conditions of the potential used in the schrdinger equation .",
    "likewise , the green and red straight lines are the calculated positions of the molecular states with the effective @xmath1-wave scattering length approach . for the triplet scattering length",

    "the smaller peaks at higher frequencies , that are visible in the spectra for the @xmath44=36 - 41 , are attributed to excited vibrational states in the triplet potential . in the spectra for @xmath44=41 - 45 peaks at even smaller frequencies than the molecular ground state are visible , that correspond to triatomic states in the triplet potential with twice the binding energy of the molecular diatomic ground state .",
    "the peak at higher frequencies visible in the spectra of 36@xmath4 - 40@xmath4 of similar signal strength as the triplet ground state molecule is the molecular ground state in the mixed singlet - triplet potential , which we find in the calculations to have comparable overlap with the @xmath58 state as the triplet molecule .",
    "+ we fit the zero - energy singlet @xmath1-wave scattering length , to match the binding energy of the mixed molecule to the experimental data , in a least square fit obtaining the value of a@xmath70=-0.2a@xmath71 .",
    "a change of the obtained value of the singlet @xmath1-wave scattering length by @xmath720.5a@xmath71 does not substantially influence the calculated binding energy ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "this obtained value of the singlet scattering length is different from the value predicted for rb in @xcite , in which they did not include the interaction with the magnetic field in the theoretical model .",
    "this approach allows one to predict the position of the molecular peaks satisfactorily and can be used as an estimate for future experiments .",
    "calculation of the potentials using the full diagonalization method reveals the importance of the @xmath2  -  wave scattering contribution @xcite .",
    "the difference in shape of the potential using the two approaches can be seen in fig.[fig3 ] and is especially pronounced for the mixed molecules . there",
    ", the @xmath3-dependence and the @xmath2-wave scattering lowers the outermost lobe of the scattering potentials , such that it becomes comparable with the second last lobe . as a consequence , the molecular ground state",
    "is delocalized over multiple wells and effectively has a lower binding energy .",
    "the full calculation , without any additional fitting parameters , reproduces the observed molecular lines with an accuracy better than @xmath73mhz .",
    "this shows that the nonrelativistic @xmath9-rb scattering phase shifts must be quite accurate and are appropriate for calculating rydberg molecule potentials .",
    "nonetheless , the resolution achieved in our experiment reveals a systematic deviation , which suggests that our data could be used to refine these scattering phase shifts .",
    "in the last section we study the magnetic field dependency of the mixed singlet - triplet molecules .",
    "anderson et al . have used a perturbative approach to calculate magnetic moments of the zero - field pure triplet and mixed states @xcite . by including the zeeman terms directly in the hamiltonian ( eq.[eq:1 ] )",
    "we can treat this problem non - perturbatively and calculate the full zeeman - map for the relevant molecular states using the effective scattering length approach ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "we find that once the zeeman splitting becomes comparable to the energy difference between the families of pure and mixed molecular states , the shift of individual lines no longer depends linearly on the applied field . for @xmath44=40",
    "this cross - over from the zeeman to the paschen - back regime with respect to the molecular binding energies happens at a magnetic field @xmath74 g . our experimental data falls into the `` high''-field regime .",
    "we observe that the zeeman shift of the mixed molecular states is weaker than that of two isolated atoms .",
    "this is due to all the contributions in the hamiltonian ( eq.[eq:1 ] ) resulting in a mixing of the spin orientations . in the inset of fig.[fig5 ] it can be seen that the experimental data and the results of our presented theoretical model match quite well .",
    "both of our models predict the right slope in the small range of experimentally studied values of the magnetic field , even though the calculation with the full diagonalization method shows an offset of about @xmath75mhz .",
    "note that for the pure triplet states observed in previous publications , the magnetic field does not influence the shape of the molecular potential and the molecules therefore show the same zeeman shift as the respective asymptotic atomic state .",
    "theoretical zeeman map of the mixed and triplet molecular states corresponding to the asymptotic @xmath76s rydberg and @xmath68 ground state , calculated using the effective scattering length approach .",
    "zero energy reference point is the atomic pair state @xmath77 .",
    "the black dashed line shows the theoretical zeeman shift of the atomic rydberg spin down state , which we use for the calibration of the magnetic field in the experiment .",
    "the experimental data from our spectroscopy in the magnetic trap lie in the blue shaded region and are shown as dots in the inset : atomic rydberg spin down state ( black ) , triplet molecular ground state ( red ) and mixed molecular ground state ( green ) .",
    "straight lines show the calculated line positions using the effective scattering length approach , shaded areas indicate the results of the full diagonalization calculation ( color code is the same as for experimental data ) .",
    "the atomic rydberg spin down state is again shown by the black dashed line .",
    "error bars are the 95% confidence intervals of the lorentzian fit positions taken from more than 4000 measurements . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated mixed singlet - triplet rydberg molecules in rb and have extracted a zero - energy singlet scattering length a@xmath70=-0.2a@xmath71 .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath2-wave term in the electron - ground state scattering reveals the importance of the @xmath2-wave shape resonance in particular for these mixed molecular states @xcite .",
    "we have studied the magnetic field dependence of the observed molecular states .",
    "the interaction with the magnetic field , similar to the electric field @xcite , also creates the possibility of engineering the molecular state .",
    "our high resolution data can serve as a reference for @xmath9-rb scattering phase shift calculations .",
    "the precision of the input parameters entering these calculations e.g. ground state polarizability @xmath78 , have improved over the years @xcite , which could lead to a significant change in the phase shifts we can now measure .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical calculation can be improved further , by treating the scattering interaction and the interaction with the external magnetic field in the same step and not limiting the interaction with the magnetic field to a small subspace of the hilbert space . in the future",
    "this can than be used to describe the magnetic field dependence of mixed singlet - triplet rydberg molecules in the high density of a bose - einstein condensate , where the effect of the p - wave resonance is even more pronounced @xcite and as such more states have to be considered in the calculation .",
    "we thank i. i. fabrikant for providing us the @xmath9-rb scattering phase shifts and georg raithel for very helpful comments , as well as chris greene and j.  prez - ros for fruitful discussions and the contribution to the full diagonalization code .",
