    "for a finite family @xmath7 of geometric objects in the plane , the _ union complexity _ of @xmath8 ( or , in short , the union complexity of @xmath9 ) is the number of _ vertices _ on the boundary @xmath10 , where a vertex is an intersection point of the boundaries of two objects @xmath11 .",
    "more generally , for any @xmath12 , the _ @xmath5-level complexity _ of @xmath9 is the number of vertices that are contained in the interior of at most @xmath13 elements of @xmath9 .",
    "bounding the union complexity of families of geometric objects is useful for analyzing the running time of various algorithms , and has applications to linear programming , robotics , molecular modeling , and many other fields .",

    "smorodinsky  @xcite showed that bounds on the union complexity and on the level-1 complexity of families of geometric objects in the plane can be used in computing the proper chromatic number and the conflict - free chromatic number of the corresponding hypergraph . for more on union complexity ,",

    "however , one may note that such a family contains as many as @xmath24 pairwise disjoint sets .",
    "hence , it is natural to ask whether any family of axis - parallel rectangles with a quadratic union complexity must contain a linear - sized sub - family whose elements are pairwise disjoint .    in this note",

    ", @xmath0 denotes a family of axis - parallel rectangles in the plane , and we assume that @xmath0 is in _ general position _ , meaning that no two rectangles have more than 4 common points ( i.e. , no two rectangles share a segment of the boundary ; this implies that no three boundaries intersect at the same point ) .",

    "of course , @xmath36 is the union complexity of @xmath0 and @xmath37 is the @xmath5-level complexity of @xmath0 .",
    "intersection points of boundaries of two axis - parallel rectangles can be partitioned into four types , depicted in figure  [ fig : types - of - intersection ] .",
    "the type described in figure  [ fig : types - of - intersection](a ) ( in which the intersection point is the rightmost - upmost point of the intersection of the rectangles ) will be called _ type l _ intersection .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the set of all points of type @xmath39 in @xmath33 , and by @xmath40 the set of all points of type @xmath39 in @xmath35 .    for any intersection point @xmath31 of type @xmath39",
