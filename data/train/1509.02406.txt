    "observation of the higgs particle at cern @xcite has opened the new era of precise study of its properties .",
    "once its mass is known , one may reconsider a possibility of its direct observation in the lepton annihilation @xmath3 or @xmath4 , at future electron colliders or dedicated muon collider .",
    "due to extremely small coupling of the higgs boson to electron , it seems at first sight that its direct production in the electron collider is just hopeless .",
    "however , in the future circular collider with @xmath5 beams ( fccee ) considered at cern featuring very high luminosity , this process would in principle be observable , provided one could eliminate copious background processes .",
    "on the other hand , stronger coupling of higgs to muons puts dedicated muon collider into a definite advantage , provided decent luminosity and small beam energy spread are achieved . in either case , machine energy spread and an additional smearing of the beam energy due to qed bremsstrahlung are major points in the feasibility studies of these projects .",
    "this is why the present study was undertaken .",
    "the influence of the beam energy spread on observability of the direct higgs observation in fccee collider was already discussed at the @xmath6th fcc - ee physics workshop @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall concentrate mainly on calculating effects due to initial state radiation of multiple photons .",
    "this will be done exploiting past experience in calculating very precisely similar qed effect for the z boson productions at lep experiments , for instance in ref .",
    ". similar analysis of the intial state qed corrections , taking into accound the machine energy spread , for @xmath4 process can be also found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after defining the born cross section for the higgs process production in the lepton annihilation , we will discuss the effect of the initial state radiation ( isr ) corrections .",
    "we shall discuss theoretical uncertainties in the evaluation of this qed effect , presenting numerical results for three different qed isr formulas , of the varying sophistication level .",
    "the effect of the machine energy spread in the cross section will be added in the discussion , presenting numerical results for several values of such a spread .",
    "finally the analogous effects in planned muon colliders will be discussed and numerical results will be presented .",
    "born cross section for the higgs particle production in @xmath7 collider is given by the ( relativistic @xcite ) breit - wigner ( b - w ) formula @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9gev and @xmath10 according to refs .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "the electron and muon branching ratios are related by the factor @xmath13 , thus the above result can be obtained from @xmath14 , see also refs .",
    "there are variants of the b - w formulas with the @xmath15-dependent width , but for the narrow resonance like higgs they differ negligibly from the above , see more discussion in the appendix  a.    the initial state radiation correction to this process was calculated using formulas of ref .",

    "this kind of colliders will produce clean sample of higgs boson without much background and therefore would allow to measure higgs mass and its properties very precisely .",
    "our analysis is vital in view of map ( muon accelerator program ) @xcite at fermilab and the new ideas of producing muon monochromatic beams , that would allow to limit the major obstacle , the machine energy spread .",
    "thanks to much higher branching ratio for the higgs to muon pair , the production cross section for the @xmath45 is much higher . also , qed effects for muon collider are roughly factor 2 weaker , simply because for muon beams at the higgs peek @xmath46 , as compared to @xmath47 for electron beams .",

    "it was found that for electron collider the qed isr reduces by itself peak cross section by factor 0.338 .",
    "the qed higher order uncertainty of this results was estimated to be below @xmath54 .",
    "the proper double convolution of the qed radiative spectrum with the machine energy spread was performed and doubly cross - checked .",
    "for instance machine energy spread of the same size as higgs width ( @xmath55mev ) reduces higgs production cross section further down to 0.172@xmath56 .",
    "these results are compatible ( albeit slightly different ) from these in the preliminary analysis shown at the recent fccee workshop , see @xcite .",
    "it forms a solid basis for any analysis of the observability of the higgs resonant cross section in the future @xmath57 colliders .",
    "the same analysis was also repeated for the muon colliders , where the reduction factor due to qed isr at the peak position was found to be 0.548 and , for instance , it gets reduced further down to 0.162 for the energy beam spread being twice the higgs width .",
    "in this short appendix we want to comment on the issue of the form of the non - uniqueness of the breit - wigner formula ( [ breit - wigner ] ) and we shall show that for extremely narrow higgs boson resonance this non - uniqueness is numerically completely irrelevant .",
    "the literature on this question is numerous , for instance in the context of the precision measurements of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 boson production and decay the reader may consult refs .",

    "the maximum of the cross section is at @xmath64 for the fixed width and @xmath65 for @xmath15-dependent width .",

    "it is practically impossible to achieve energy resolution in accelerators of that order of magnitude .",

    "starting from eq .  ( [ sigmaisr ] )",
    "we are going to provide a very simple approximate formula that allows to estimate the suppression factor of the peak cross section at @xmath71 due to qed isr corrections , thus providing quick / easy cross - check of more sophisticated numerical calculations .",
