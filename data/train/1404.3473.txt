    "the situation is more complicated for some of the 3-body or 4-body systems made of nucleons and hyperons , and needs to be clarified .",
    "the tetraneutron , @xmath8{n}=(n , n , n , n)$ ] , is naively suggested by the stability of isotope , but has received only controversial experimental indications  @xcite .",
    "its stability can not be established using realistic neutron - neutron potentials @xcite , nor even with potentials made artificially deeper to produce a dineutron , due to the pauli principle .",
    "the question is thus addressed of the stability of a modified tetraneutron with bose statistics , namely @xmath9[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}=(n , n,\\lambda,\\lambda)$ ] with spin - singlet wavefunctions for both the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 pairs endorsing the antisymmetrisation .",

    "there is only one claim for @xmath16[\\lambda]{n}=(n , n,\\lambda)$ ] , at about 3gev  @xcite .",
    "the sector of strangeness @xmath19 , or `` double @xmath20 '' hypernuclei has also been investigated , in particular , after the `` nagara '' event @xcite , which is the very accurate recent observation of  , and a measurement of its binding energy , which sets a limit on the @xmath11 effective attraction in that system .",
    "this nagara event motivated to question whether lighter @xmath19 systems exist or not  @xcite .    in 2002 ,",
    "filikhin and gal  @xcite studied the @xmath8[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] system , and found it unbound within the models they adopted .",
    "however , their calculation was revisited by nemura , akaishi and myint @xcite , who used a more sophisticated method for solving the four - body problem , and found a small amount of binding , below the dissociation threshold into @xmath16[\\lambda]{h}+\\lambda$ ] .",
    "this illustrates once more how the four - body problem is delicate in the regime of weak binding . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is stressed that the free @xmath11 interaction receives a significant contribution from the @xmath21 coupling , which is mediated by the exchange of kaons , and is suppressed in a dense nucleus due to the antisymmetrisation between the nucleons in the core and the nucleon in @xmath22 .",
    "this pauli suppression was successfully invoked to explain the relatively weak binding of @xmath23[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] .",
    "however , the pauli suppression requires a @xmath24 correlation inside the @xmath23[\\lambda\\lambda]{he}$ ] system , and thus it does not operate in the limit of very weak binding .    the aim of this work is to investigate the stability of the system , to discuss its production mechanism and its possible role in astrophysics . as follows , we will demonstrate in sec .",

    "is then given in sec .",
    "we shall start by some reminders of binding systems whose subsystems are unbound in this section . in his study of the range of nuclear forces",
    ", thomas @xcite discovered that the ratio of 3-body to 2-body bound - state energies , @xmath26 , becomes very large if the range of the interaction decreases .",
    "equivalently , for a given ( short ) range , @xmath27 if the coupling @xmath28 approaches ( from above ) the minimal value @xmath29 required to bind two particles . here",
    ", the potential energy is written as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is attractive or contains attractive parts , and @xmath32 denotes the inter - particle separation .",
    "implicit in this `` thomas collapse '' is that the minimal coupling @xmath33 to bind three particles is smaller than @xmath29 , so that for @xmath34 there is a `` borromean '' 3-body bound state whose two - body subsystems are unbound .    since the work by thomas in 1935",
    ", borromean binding has been further investigated .",
    "there are rigorous bounds on the allowed domain of coupling constants for binding systems whose subsystems are unbound  @xcite , and studies on how wide is the borromean window as a function of the shape of the potential  @xcite or of the low - energy parameters of the pair interactions @xcite",
    ".    the allowed values of @xmath35 can be bound below rigorously  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to decompose the hamiltonian @xmath36 into sub - hamiltonians , say @xmath37 . then @xmath36 hardly becomes negative if all @xmath38 are positive .",
    "there are several variants and refinements , depending on whether the center - of - mass motion is properly removed and enough flexibility is introduced to account for unequal masses and couplings . for the three - body problem , the best decomposition @xcite leads for @xmath39 to the forbidden domains shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmm - mmmm](a ) .",

    "this drawing corresponds to @xmath43.,title=\"fig : \" ]    ( a)(b )    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmm - mmmm](a ) , the forbidden domain extents to nearly 3/4 of the borromean sector @xmath44 .",
    "the reason is that as far as one deviates from the case of three identical particles , the various cluster decompositions of the wavefunction , such as @xmath45 $ ] or @xmath46 $ ] , would not overlap much and can not interfere efficiently to build a collective binding of these three particles .",
    "the same reasoning , when applied to the @xmath40 system that involves two masses and three couplings , gives the forbidden domain  @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmm - mmmm](b ) .",
    "the allowed fraction is larger than in the 3-body case .",
    "this is an encouragement for us to perform the 4-body calculations , namely , to determine to which extent some points of the `` non - forbidden '' domain can lead to actual 4-body bound states .",
    "another encouragement is the existence of fully borromean 4-body bound states in the case of screened coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the actual frontier of borromean binding depends , indeed , on the shape of the potential .",
    "an analysis has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the rigorous lower bound tends to be saturated for potentials with an external repulsive barrier . on the other hand ,",
    "the window of borromean binding is more and more reduced for potentials with harder and harder inner core .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] , a slightly different analysis is proposed . for a mass @xmath47 such that @xmath48 to fix the scale",
    ", we compare the 3-body binding energy @xmath49 as a function of the effective range @xmath50 for three different potentials , i.e. , @xmath51 - 2\\,g\\,\\exp[-\\mu\\,(r - r ) ] \\",

    "this gives @xmath28 as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "for the morse potential , we use @xmath54 for the illustration purpose .     as a function of the 2-body effective range parameter @xmath50 , for the exponential , yukawa and morse ( with @xmath54 ) potentials , where @xmath28 and @xmath53 are linked to reproduced a 2-body scattering length @xmath52 . ]",
    "the lessons of this exercise are :    * the algebraic energy is a sharply increasing function of the effective range .",
    "this means that models with a very large effective range can not generate much borromean binding  @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of ordinary 3-body binding ( not fully borromean ) , the dependence upon the effective range might be different  @xcite . *",
    "the amount of borromean binding does not depend dramatically on the shape of the potential , as seen by comparing models whose short - range part is attractive ( yukawa ) , constant ( exponential ) or repulsive ( morse ) .",
    "the behavior would be universal , if instead of @xmath49 vs.  @xmath50 , one plots @xmath49 against the imaginary part of the pole position of the 2-body problem .",
    "however , since the pole position is not easily accessible in the models we use , we keep the effective range as a tool for the discussion .    in short",
    ", it looks reasonable to use simple models to study borromean binding , given that both the scattering length and effective range are properly reproduced .    for fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] and other 3-body problems in the regime of weak binding , an efficient variational method makes use of the distances @xmath55 ,  , and a basis of exponential functions @xmath56 $ ] . for any given",
    "set of non - linear parameters @xmath57 , the variational energy and coefficients @xmath58 are obtained from a simple eigenvalue equation . as done sometimes for gaussians  @xcite ,",
    "the non - linear parameters are assigned to belong to a single geometric series @xmath59 , and thus the minimisation of the energy is achieved by varying @xmath60 and @xmath31 .",
    "the results are cross - checked against the stochastic variational method of suzuki and varga  @xcite based on gaussian wavefunctions , and the associated computer code @xcite , which is also used for 4-body systems .",
    "we first test a simple toy model , where the potential for each pair is taken as @xmath61 , with a unique range @xmath62 . the 2-body problem can be solved analytically to identify the couplings @xmath63 providing a given 2-body energy or a given 2-body scattering length .",
    "once the nucleon - nucleon sector is fixed , the @xmath64 coupling of the nucleon - hyperon interaction , assumed to be spin - independent , has been fixed as to reproduce an energy of about @xmath65mev for .",
    "for @xmath66gev , i.e. , a short - range toy model , one obtains unrealistically - low values for the effective - range parameters , e.g. , about @xmath67gev@xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70gev@xmath68 for @xmath71 , and the 4-body configurations of interest are found stable . in particular , @xmath8[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] is bound below the threshold for dissociation into @xmath16[\\lambda]{h}+\\lambda$ ] , even for a coupling @xmath72 as low as about a quarter of the value required to bind @xmath73 , and the isovector configurations @xmath8[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] and  @xmath8[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}$ ] are found stable against complete dissociation .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath74gev corresponding to a long - range interaction , the effective - range parameters are systematically over - estimated , and the 4-body systems @xmath8[\\lambda\\lambda]{h}$ ] with both isospsin @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath8[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}$ ] become unstable , unless a large value is adopted for @xmath72 , implying a positive @xmath11 scattering length and a bound @xmath11 .    the analysis with toy models motivates the choice of a tractable potential which gives realistic effective - range parameters , i.e. , which reproduces either the scattering lengths @xmath77 and effective - range @xmath78 of the models esc08a - esc08c of the nijmegen - riken group @xcite , or the more recent values based on chiral effective field theory ( ceft)@xcite . more precisely , we adopted the parameters given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",

    "the model reproduces , not surprisingly , the observed binding of the  and  systems . for the latter ,",
    "both the spin @xmath82 and @xmath83 exist , as there is no much difference between the spin - triplet and the spin - averaged nucleon - hyperon interactions .",
    "the states with isospin @xmath76 and spin @xmath82 and @xmath16[\\lambda]{n}$ ] are marginally unbound , and would become bound , for instance , if some masses are increased by about 10% .",
    "our results for @xmath16[\\lambda]{n}$ ] agree with the conclusions of recent studies @xcite .",

    "the state with isospin @xmath76 and miss binding by a very small amount with the nijmegen - riken parameters , but become bound by about 1mev with the ceft parameters .",
    "it is interesting that the most recent approach to inter - hadronic forces slightly differs from the conventional approach .    at this point , however , one can not firmly conclude before including 3-body forces .",
    "they probably have an attractive component , which is the analogue of the attraction brought by 3-body forces to few - nucleons systems .",
    "some spin - dependence of the 3-body forces can not be excluded , this could be invoked to keep the spin @xmath82 state of bound and move the @xmath83 in the continuum .",
    "the 3-body and @xmath84-body forces with @xmath85 probably contain a repulsive - component of shorter - range , which reflects that if several hyperons or several hyperons and nucleons overlap , they feel the effect of the pauli exclusion of their constituent quarks .",
    "this repulsive component seems needed in large systems containing strangeness  @xcite .",
    "the calculations of hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon forces should be pushed to higher order within chiral effective theories and nijmegen - riken models , as the 3-body components will emerge automatically together with a refinement of the 2-body ones .",
    "we now propose and discuss a possible production mechanism for @xmath9[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}$ ] , but omitting most details . the most ideal process to create such a loosely - bound neutral system is via the deuteron - deuteron ( @xmath86 ) scattering , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "this is an extremely clean process . by tagging the @xmath88 events and examining the missing mass spectrum recoiling against the @xmath88 pairs , the signal for @xmath5",
    ", if @xmath5 does exist , will accumulate at the mass of @xmath5 to form a narrow peak .",
    "we now analyze the reaction mechanism and make a numerical evaluation of the cross section .",

    "[ fig : reac ] one of the typical transition processes is illustrated with the kinematic variables defined and others are implicated . in the @xmath86 collision ,",
    "the two protons scatter and exchange mesons such as @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 etc , and the @xmath88 pair is created in association with the @xmath11 .",
    "the central collision will kinematically favour the formation of @xmath93 in the final state . as the leading - order test of this formation mechanism , we assume that the relative internal momenta between the proton and neutron inside the incident deuterons is negligibly small compared to the relative momentum between these two initial deuterons .",
    "it means that we have neglected the fermi motion inside the initial deuterons in the reaction .",
    "we have also neglected the final - state interactions among the final - state baryons .",
    "thus the neutrons are treated as spectators and their contributions to the amplitude will be via the convolution of the final - baryon momentum distributions .",
    "taking into account the large @xmath94 coupling and the small pion mass , the underlying mechanism will be dominated by the @xmath90 exchange and through two combined elementary process @xmath95 , which is known .",
    "the born term , with a virtual nucleon in the intermediate state , gives a significant contribution , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] .",
    "the @xmath96 resonance has relatively smaller contributions mainly due to the smaller couplings to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "although some higher @xmath99 resonances may also have important contributions and benefit from a significant coupling to @xmath98 , our estimate including the born term and @xmath96 excitations can be regarded as a conservative estimate of the @xmath5 production cross section .    ) . from upper to lower the curves stand for the total cross sections of the full calculations , exclusive process from the nucleon born terms , exclusive process from the double @xmath96 excitations , and exclusive process from the one born transition and one @xmath96 excitation . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : missingmass ] we show the missing mass spectra for the recoiled @xmath93 at different energies above the production threshold .",
    "it shows that the peak position is located at the four baryon @xmath100 threshold .",
    "since we have not introduced a dynamic wavefunction for @xmath93 , the integration over the internal momentum only present a momentum distribution that we introduced for these two @xmath101 clusters .",
    "this leads to the relatively extended tail of the peak as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : missingmass ] . however ,",
    "notice that the deuteron is dominated by the @xmath102-wave and @xmath5 is also treated as an @xmath102-wave isoscalar system .",
    "our estimate is sufficient to demonstrate the behavior of the correlated system recoiled by the @xmath103 pair . in case that the final - state baryons are not bound",
    ", the peak will disappear in the missing mass spectrum .     at different energies above the production threshold in @xmath104    .",
    "[ fig : missingmass ]",
    "the stability of @xmath16[\\lambda]{n}$ ] and , more likely , of @xmath9[\\lambda\\lambda]{n}$ ] is within the uncertainties of our knowledge of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "many effects should be taken into account to refine the predictions .",
    "we already mentioned the 3-body and 4-body forces .",
    "also , it would be interesting to unfold the effective @xmath105 interaction , to separate the contribution from @xmath106 , and to recalculate the @xmath107 systems with explicit coupling to @xmath108 .",
    "similar considerations hold for the @xmath11 coupling to @xmath109 .",
    "as stressed in the literature @xcite , the coupling to channels with @xmath110 or @xmath111 gives extra attraction if it induces additional spin and isospin coupling that are not present if the picture is restricted to nucleons and @xmath20 .",
    "as in earlier studies , e.g. , @xcite , we used simple potentials that mimic more elaborate interactions . for three - nucleons systems , this is a notorious source of overbinding , as analyzed in the literature @xcite , in particular for the tensor forces absorbed into an effective central component .",
    "however , the effect becomes much less important for dilute systems whose wave function extends very far and thus does not probe the details of the interaction region .",
    "most interesting , in our opinion , is the possibility to produce @xmath5 in deuteron - deuteron @xmath112 collisions .",
    "as both @xmath113 and @xmath5 are weakly bound , their constituents are almost on shell .",
    "this simplifies the calculation of the production cross - section coupling from elementary coupling among hadrons , and suppresses any off - shell corrections .",
    "we are confident that this will be an efficient doorway to this system . in brief , this new type of element , if does exist , would bring novel insights into the nuclear forces that hold the building block hadrons together and provide a great opportunity for extending our knowledge to some unreached part in our matter world .",
