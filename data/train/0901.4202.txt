    "spectral analysis of hot , compact stars by means of non - lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) model - atmosphere techniques has for a long time been regarded as a domain of specialists .",
    "in contrast to the assumption of lte , where occupation numbers of atomic levels are determined by saha equation and boltzmann statistics , radiative and collisional transitions have to be considered in detail ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this makes the calculation of an elaborated model and its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) time - consuming , although it can be performed on presently available pcs .",
    "faster and easier is the use of blackbody seds , tempting , e.g. , old - fashioned users of photoionization codes to use such for the ( bad ) representation of the exciting source of an ionized gaseous nebula  spoiling the advantages of the best of these codes .    within the last four decades , non - lte model - atmospheres arrived at a high level of sophistication : fully line - blanketed models consider opacities of all elements from h to ni @xcite . within the gavo",
