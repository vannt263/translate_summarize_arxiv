    "<S> we revisit the problem of full counting statistics of particles on a segment of a one - dimensional gas of free fermions . using a combination of analytical and numerical methods , we study the crossover between the counting of discrete particles and of the continuous particle density as a function of smoothing in the counting procedure . in the discrete - particle limit </S>",
    "<S> , the result is given by the fisher  hartwig expansion for toeplitz determinants , while in the continuous limit we recover the bosonization results . </S>",
    "<S> this example of full counting statistics with smoothing is also related to orthogonality catastrophe , fermi - edge singularity and non - equilibrium bosonization .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ introduction . ] ] introduction. + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    full counting statistics ( fcs ) , in theoretical - condensed - matter context , refers to a class of problems involving the probability distribution of a quantum observable ( usually the number of electrons found in a certain region of space or transported through the system over a certain time ) with a particular focus on quantum behavior . </S>",
    "<S> examples of fcs problems are the anti - bunching of electrons in a one - dimensional conductor due to their fermionic statistics @xcite and a single - electron emitter , first proposed theoretically @xcite and recently realized experimentally @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest fcs problems assume non - interacting fermions ( electrons ) , so that the resulting counting statistics can be expressed in terms of a determinant taking into account antisymmetrization of the relevant multi - particle processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach is based on the bosonization technique ( using the equivalence between bosons and fermions in one dimension ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bosonization methods for fcs can be extended to include interactions , but they usually do not fully take into account the discreteness of particles @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to understand limitations of the bosonization approach to fcs and its connection to the exact calculation with discrete fermions . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we address this problem by studying fcs in a one - dimensional free - fermion model , where an uncertainty ( smoothing ) in the counting procedure is introduced , so that the particle number is no longer quantized . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , we can study in full detail a crossover between the discrete - particle and bosonization results as the uncertainty increases . while the details of this crossover depend on the profile of the introduced uncertainty , the qualitative description of the crossover is found to be universal : fcs respects the discreteness of particles if the uncertainty region is much narrower than the ( average ) inter - particle distance , but crosses over to the bosonization result when the uncertainty region is much wider than the inter - particle distance .    </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , this problem amounts to studying an evolution of the asymptotic behavior of a toeplitz ( or , more precisely , wiener  </S>",
    "<S> hopf ) determinant with a fisher  hartwig singularity @xcite as the singularity is smoothed in a certain way . in the case of a sharp singularity , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding determinant is given by a double asymptotic series of a fisher  hartwig type fully respecting the particle discreteness @xcite . as the singularity is smoothed , the secondary branches of this expansion get suppressed , and the remaining leading branch reproduces the bosonization result .     for @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the three models of smoothing . ]    </S>",

    "<S> we introduce the fcs generating function as @xcite @xmath3 where the average is taken over the ground state . the particle - counting operator @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators and @xmath8 is the weight function for the particle counting . </S>",

    "<S> an agreement between the results computed with this method ( at @xmath46 ) and the fitting procedure for the full function @xmath29 serves as an independent check of our numerical scheme .    as expected , while the actual values of the coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath24 depend on the chosen smoothing model , qualitatively the crossover between the discrete particle counting and a continuous bosonization description occurs at @xmath49 in all the three models .    </S>",

    "<S> this implies that the non - bosonization corrections arising from the discreteness of particles should be visible , in this range of @xmath21 , at sufficiently large @xmath9 ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding values of @xmath9 depend on the particular choice of smoothing and can be deduced from comparing the two terms in ( [ expansion - a ] ) using the asymptotics at large @xmath25 derived above . </S>",

    "<S> [ [ discussion . ] ] discussion. + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this letter , we have discussed the crossover from discrete to continuous fcs in the model of free one - dimensional fermions , as a function of smoothing . </S>",
    "<S> this model may serve as an illustration of a relation between discrete and continuous descriptions in a wide spectrum of similar problems , including fcs with temporal measurements , fermi - edge singularity , orthogonality catastrophe , and non - equilibrium bosonization .    by fcs with temporal measurements </S>",
    "<S> we understand a fcs setup where the counting is performed over a certain time interval , e.g. , by opening and closing an electric contact or by applying a time - dependent voltage pulse @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation of fcs used in the original fcs papers differs from our approach where the measurement is extended in space instead of time . </S>",
    "<S> this difference implies the necessity of regularizing the contribution of the fermi sea in temporal fcs : a large current of left - movers is compensated by a similarly large current of right - movers , so the average charge transfer is determined by the vicinity of the fermi level , while the quantum noise depends on the ultraviolet cutoff defined by the fermi energy @xmath73 ( arising from the bottom of the fermi sea ) . in our spatial formulation , there is no cutoff introduced by the bottom of the fermi sea , and both the total number of particles and its fluctuations depend on the same scale @xmath2 . as a consequence of this difference in ultraviolet cutoffs , </S>",
    "<S> our results can not be literally translated to the case of temporal fcs . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that the main qualitative conclusion will hold also in the temporal case : the generating function @xmath74 loses periodicity in @xmath21 when the smoothing time scale exceeds the typical time between particles ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> determinants similar to the generating function @xmath74 also appear in problems related to the orthogonality catastrophe and to the fermi - edge singularity ( fes ) . in those cases , </S>",
    "<S> the counterparts of the secondary branches of @xmath74 are secondary singularities ( cusps or peaks ) in the frequency - dependent response function ( the closed - loop contribution in the fes context ) . </S>",
    "<S> such secondary cusps and peaks were studied , e.g. , in the recent work @xcite ( and , in the case of a bound - state contribution , earlier in @xcite ) . according to our predictions , </S>",
    "<S> such cusps and peaks should be most visible in case of instant switching of the scattering potential , but get suppressed if the switching time of the scattering potential exceeds @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> we should also remark that most studies of fes involve an artificial regularization of the fermi - sea contribution at energy scales smaller than @xmath73 , so that secondary singularities in the response function are neglected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such secondary singularities ( separated from the main peak by @xmath73 ) are probably not experimentally relevant in physical metals , where @xmath73 is a large energy scale , but may be of interest in other models with fes physics where @xmath73 is , for some reason , small ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an example from spin - liquid theory ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also mention recent works on non - equilibrium bosonization where determinants similar to ours appear ( again , in the temporal form ) @xcite . similarly to the fes problem discussed above , these works assume a regularization of the fermi - sea contribution , which is equivalent to neglecting the secondary branches of the fisher  hartwig expansion related to the bottom of the fermi sea .
