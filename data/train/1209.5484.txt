    "<S> it is a meaningful issue that under what condition neighborhoods induced by a covering are equal to the covering itself . </S>",

    "<S> third , we concentrate on the inverse issue of computing neighborhoods by a covering , namely giving an arbitrary covering , whether or not there exists another covering such that the neighborhoods induced by it is just the former covering . we present a necessary and sufficient condition for this issue as well . in a word , through the study on the two fundamental issues induced by neighborhoods </S>",
