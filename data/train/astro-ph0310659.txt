    "our knowledge of the  properties of quasars at @xmath0 has advanced rapidly over the past few years . in particular , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , york et al .",
    "2000 ) has generated large and well - defined samples of @xmath0 quasars ( e.g. , anderson et al .",
    "2001 ) ; most of these quasars are suitable for  studies .",
    "the  observational strategy has comprised archival studies of high - redshift quasars with  ( kaspi , brandt , & schneider 2000 ; vignali et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter v01 ) , snapshot observations with  to define basic quasar  properties such as fluxes and luminosities ( e.g. , v01 ; brandt et al .",

    "; vignali et al . 2003a , b , hereafter v03a , v03b ) and longer observations with  to derive either tight constraints on the  emission ( e.g. , brandt et al . 2001 ) or spectral parameters by direct  fitting ( ferrero & brinkmann 2003 ; grupe et al .",
    "snapshot observations have also allowed joint spectral fitting of subsamples of quasars drawn from two main samples at @xmath0 : the optically luminous palomar digital sky survey ( e.g. , djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) and the sdss .",
    "the  spectral results provide no evidence of strong spectral evolution in radio - quiet quasar ( rqq )  emission from local samples up to ; the spectrum at high redshift is well parameterized by a power law in the rest - frame band with ( v03a ; v03b ) . furthermore",
    ", no evidence for widespread intrinsic  absorption has been found , although it seems likely that a few individual objects may be  absorbed ( e.g. , v01 ; v03b ) .",
    "these overall results have been supported recently by direct  spectroscopy of qso  0000@xmath4263 at @xmath5 with  ( ferrero & brinkmann 2003 ) .",
    "the color selection of the sdss has been proven to be effective in finding high - redshift optically luminous quasars up to ( see fan et al .",
    "2003 for sdss quasars at higher redshifts ) . on the other hand , moderately deep  observations and the ultra - deep ( 2  ms ) survey of the  deep field - north ( cdf - n ; alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) can detect active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at @xmath0 that are typically times less luminous than the sdss quasars ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "2002 ; silverman et al . 2002 ; vignali et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter v02 ; castander et al .",
    "these agn are much more numerous and therefore more representative of the agn population at high redshift than the rare sdss quasars ; however , their  emission does not appear to contribute significantly to reionization at ( barger et al .",
    "a detailed  spectral analysis of the @xmath0 agn in the cdf - n is presented in v02 .",
    "below we present some new  spectral results obtained by joint spectral fitting of all the rqqs at @xmath0 thus far detected by . a spectral analysis performed on a smaller but more   luminous sample of @xmath0 radio - loud quasars",
    "is presented by bassett et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "to define the overall  properties of @xmath0 rqqs , we selected all of the rqqs detected by  with @xmath6 counts in the observed band .",
    "the sample comprises 46 quasars with a median redshift of 4.43 ; the number of source counts is .",
    "note that these quasars represent a large fraction ( @xmath1  70% ) of the optically selected rqqs at @xmath0 with  detections at present .. ] although it is possible that individual objects are characterized by `` peculiar ''  properties , our approach obtains average spectral parameters for the quasar population at @xmath0 using a much larger sample than those presented in v03a and v03b . in the  spectral analysis ,",
    "the cash statistic ( cash 1979 ) has been adopted .",
    "our preliminary analysis shows that a power law fits the  data reasonably well ; the photon index in the rest - frame band is @xmath7 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "rqqs detected by  with @xmath6 counts in the observed band .",
    "the spectrum shown here ( only for presentation purposes ) is fitted with a power - law model and galactic absorption ( see the text for details).,width=491,height=306 ]    this is consistent with previous results obtained for rqq samples at high redshift observed with  ( v03a ; v03b ) and  ( ferrero & brinkmann 2003 ; grupe et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as with quasar  spectral results at low and intermediate redshift ( e.g. , george et al . 2000 ; page et al 2003 ) .",
    "our analyses indicate that the  spectral properties of @xmath0 rqqs and local rqqs are similar ; the only significant differences have been found in their broad - band properties using the sdss early data release quasar catalog ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) and are likely due to luminosity effects ( vignali , brandt , & schneider 2003 ; see also brandt , schneider , & vignali , these proceedings ) .",
    "thus , despite the strong changes in large - scale environment and quasar number density that have occurred from @xmath2  06 , individual quasar  emission regions appear to evolve relatively little . from the joint  spectral",
    "fitting we also find no significant evidence for absorption above the galactic value ; the upper limit in the source rest frame is ( see vignali et al .",
    ", in preparation , for detailed discussion ) .",
    "the correlation found between quasar ab magnitude at a rest - frame wavelength of 1450    and the observed flux ( e.g. , v03b ) is a powerful tool to select samples of @xmath0 quasars suitable for follow - up  observations .",
    "the combination of snapshot observations with  and longer exposures with  should continue to be highly effective in allowing the study of the overall  properties of quasars at high redshift . in the coming years ,",
    "as the sdss is completed and several thousand  and  archival observations become available to the scientific community , our knowledge of the broad - band properties of quasars at the highest redshifts will significantly increase .",
    "however , detailed  spectroscopic analyses of large samples of @xmath0 quasars must await the more distant future and  missions such as , , and .",
