    "the goal of projects such as the ground - based laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) and the space - based laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is to detect gravitational waves , and to use them as a new observational window for relativistic astrophysics . a primary source for these gravitational waves",
    "is the coalescence of binary black holes @xcite .",
    "the highly nonlinear and dynamical merger phase of this coalescence process can only be calculated by numerical relativity , and obtaining merger gravitational waveforms , both for theoretical understanding and for detection , is dependent on long - term stable and accurate numerical evolutions . a worldwide collaboration of numerical relativists , physicists , mathematicians , and computer scientists has devoted considerable effort over the last 20 years to develop 3d codes to calculate black hole merger gravitational waveforms , and significant progress has been made , especially in the last few years",
    "however , more groundwork is required before calculations of 3d binary black hole merger templates for a variety of scenarios can be completed . greater understanding of equation formulations , boundary conditions , and dynamic gauge conditions , and the use of advanced numerical methods , is essential to achieve this goal .",
    "we believe that an important foundation for this understanding is extensive testing and analysis in 1d and 2d .",
    "choptuik s discovery of black hole critical phenomena in spherically symmetric gravitational collapse @xcite is an example of the potential of careful numerical work in 1d",
    ".    this paper reports the methodology , results , and analysis of calculations of 1d nonlinear colliding gravitational planewave spacetimes .",
    "we have chosen to investigate hyperbolic formulations of the einstein equations , as they are well - posed , they can be treated with advanced numerical methods , and they can help in the analysis of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we call a set of equations _ hyperbolic _ if the characteristic matrix can be diagonalized with a complete set of eigenvectors and real eigenvalues , following leveque @xcite .",
    "this is called _ strongly hyperbolic",
    "_ @xcite in much of the literature .",
    "the lapse and the shift are evolved during each time step in a manner which is consistent with a simple hyperbolic scheme . between time steps , the lapse and the shift are reset according to conditions which are unconstrained by the need to preserve hyperbolicity . in this way , the evolution of the hypersurfaces and spatial coordinates can be controlled to prevent large gradients , coordinate pathologies , and instabilities .",
    "some of the redundant variables of a hyperbolic formulation can also be reset between time steps .",
    "this resetting can have positive or negative effects on accuracy and stability , depending on the eigenmode structure of the reset system .",
    "finally , we find that boundary conditions should not be based naively on the eigenmodes of the hyperbolic decomposition for two reasons : ( a ) satisfying the constraint equations at the boundaries generically requires the presence of incoming eigenmodes , and ( b ) even whether the `` physical '' eigenmodes are purely outgoing at the boundaries is gauge dependent",
    ".    many ways of formulating evolution equations for the spatial metric in einstein s theory of general relativity are possible .",

    "alternative formalisms include many versions of hyperbolic systems , which add redundant variables and/or constraint terms to the equations to allow a complete set of eigenmodes describing evolution along the characteristics .",
    "as indicated by reula @xcite , there are an infinite number of hyperbolic formulations .",
    "we focus on variations of relatively simple schemes proposed by bona - mass ( bm ) @xcite and anderson - york ( ay ) @xcite , in which the characteristics propagate either at local light speed or along the hypersurface normals , and in which the variables include first derivatives of the metric .",
    "initial attempts at using hyperbolic methods in 3d were based on the bm formulation @xcite , but did not use numerical methods which take advantage of the eigenfields of the system .",
    "these codes were not much more successful than adm .",
    "non - hyperbolic baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) schemes @xcite , based on conformal decomposition of the metric , have shown considerable success in improving the stability of 3d calculations for weak and strong gravitational fields and a variety of spacetime slicings @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that a bssn scheme , combined with excision and certain dynamic gauge conditions , allows accurate numerical evolutions of 3d distorted dynamic black holes up to hundreds of dynamical times .    in the context of considering only first derivative variables , a great variety of hyperbolic schemes",
    "have been proposed that involve adding constraint terms to the equations @xcite .",
    "kidder , scheel , and teukolsky @xcite examine a rather general class of such schemes , which include the ay @xcite and frittelli - reula @xcite formulations as special cases . among these schemes",
    "are some which allow for long - term evolution of a schwarschild black hole in 3d .    in this paper",
    ", we explore ways of using hyperbolic methods that combine superior accuracy with gauge conditions which maintain stability at least for the limited dynamical times we can explore with plane waves .",
    "three basic first order systems are studied : bm , ay , and adm .",
    "hyperbolicity is obtained in our bm and ay formulations by adding momentum constraint terms to the adm equations , as in the standard formulations .",
    "the bm , ay , and adm formulations are modified by using `` mixed '' forms ( with one index raised ) of the extrinsic curvature and metric derivatives as variables .",
    "the bm formulations are further modified by resetting redundant variables , which gives an overall adm - like evolution .",
    "further , all our formulations are varied by adding a multiple of the energy constraint to the evolution equations for the extrinsic curvature .",
    "specifically , @xmath11 is added to eq .",
    "( [ kevoln1 ] ) , and @xmath12 is added to eq .",
    "( [ kevoln2 ] ) , where @xmath13 , the energy constraint coefficient , is an arbitrary real number .",
    "the adm formulation is actually hyperbolic as long as the longitudinal - transverse components of the metric and extrinsic curvature can be assumed to vanish identically , and @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "comparisons of results from our various adm , bm , and ay calculations allow us to identify and analyze aspects of equation formulation which significantly improve accuracy and/or stability .",
    "these are mixed variables , a separation of the constraint error speeds from the other characteristic speeds of the system , and maintaining long - term effective hyperbolicity ( taking into account resetting of redundant variables , but ignoring deviation from strict hyperbolicity due to resetting the lapse and the shift ) .",
    "while the same energy constraint terms as specified above are present in the standard bm formulation , numerical implementations have been carried out , as far as we are aware , only for @xmath16 ( the ricci evolution system ) and @xmath17 ( the einstein evolution system ) . adding these energy constraint terms to the ay formulation is a special case of the more general kidder , scheel , and teukolsky @xcite schemes .",
    "shinkai and yoneda @xcite analyzed the stability and accuracy properties of first order hyperbolic systems using ashtekar s connection variables in plane - symmetric spacetimes , and found that the addition of multiples of the constraints to the dynamical equations improved accuracy and stability .",
    "these results have been extended to adm systems of equations @xcite . however , the approach of shinkai and yoneda is different from ours in that they consider the constraints as independent dynamical variables .",
    "gauge choices in most previous implementations of hyperbolic formulations have been limited in order to preserve the hyperbolicity of the system . since no time derivatives of the lapse and",
    "the shift occur in the dynamical equations for the other variables , the lapse and the shift can be reset arbitrarily at any time during the numerical evolution , as pointed out by balakrishna _",
    "our gauge evolution maintains strict hyperbolicity during each time step , but the lapse and shift are reset periodically between time steps in order to control the long - term evolution of the coordinate system .",
    "the resetting may be accomplished by imposing algebraic conditions , by solving elliptic equations , or by evolving the lapse and/or shift through dynamical equations implemented independently of the main hyperbolic system .",
    "poor boundary conditions can result in the introduction of instabilities or inaccuracies into the numerical grid . in numerical relativity ,",
    "boundary conditions have usually been rather crudely implemented .",
    "some sort of outgoing radiation conditions are imposed on all components of the metric , or boundary conditions are based on an analytic exterior solution @xcite .",
    "one attraction of hyperbolic methods has been the possibility of basing boundary conditions on the eigenmodes of the characteristic matrix . however , it is clear from our planewave calculations that , particularly for the `` non - physical '' eigenmodes involving the non - transverse - traceless parts of the metric , making the amplitudes of the incoming eigenmodes at the boundaries zero can lead to serious violations of the energy and momentum constraints .",
    "furthermore , what constitutes an incoming eigenmode is dependent on the formulation of the equations as well as on gauge conditions . even imposing purely outgoing boundary conditions on the `` physical '' eigenmodes of the hyperbolic system",
    "is not strictly correct , as nonlinear coupling between the `` physical '' and `` non - physical '' eigenmodes in the source terms can generate a gauge - dependent admixture of outgoing and incoming `` physical '' eigenmodes .",
    "our boundary conditions are based on quadratic extrapolation of the variables from inside the grid to the first ghost cells on either side of the grid .",
    "the ghost cell values are then corrected to make sure the constraint equations are satisfied on the boundaries . for 1d plane waves , projection of the weyl tensor onto a null tetrad",
    "gives a gauge - independent measure of the left and right - going components of the gravitational radiation .",
    "our numerical solutions for colliding plane waves show that as the wave packets leave the grid , the incoming components of the weyl tensor are in fact zero even though there are non - zero incoming `` physical '' eigenmodes of the characteristic matrix .",
    "our focus in applying hyperbolic methods to the einstein equations is on achieving second order accuracy for smooth solutions , when the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the system are a function of position .",
    "finite difference methods such as maccormack , lax - wendroff , and staggered leapfrog @xcite , which are often used in numerical relativity , give good second order accuracy for smooth solutions , but standard wave propagation algorithms for hyperbolic systems as presented by leveque @xcite are not second order accurate when the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are spatially varying .",
    "leveque suggested a new wave propagation method @xcite for variable coefficient flux problems which we develop and apply to our 1d nonlinear gravitational planewave calculations .",
    "we show in the appendix that the new methods are formally second order accurate even with varying eigenvectors and eigenvalues , and verify second order convergence in our numerical results .",
    "the most general spatial metric for a nonlinear 1d plane wave traveling in the @xmath18-direction is @xmath19 in which @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are functions of @xmath18 alone .",
    "we will restrict our discussion to a diagonal metric in this paper .",
    "the standard adm evolution equations are first order in time and second order in space .",
    "most hyperbolic formalisms are first order in space and time , and incorporate first derivatives of the spatial metric as additional variables .",
    "the derivative variables as defined by bm are @xmath24 in our applications with a diagonal metric , we find that switching to the `` mixed '' variables @xmath25 from the `` lowered '' variables , @xmath26 and @xmath3 , improves accuracy significantly without other complications .",
    "however , with a non - diagonal metric , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not symmetric in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the evolution equations for @xmath27 acquire complicated source terms .",
    "below , we present the first order evolution equations for 1d plane waves travelling along the @xmath18-direction and described by a diagonal spatial metric , using our mixed variables . the equations with @xmath26 and @xmath3 as variables are given in the bm papers @xcite .",
    "a few points need to be made about notation .",
    "first , since our 1d problem involves derivatives only in the @xmath18-direction , we simplify our notation @xmath31 .",
    "second , a prime indicates a spatial derivative with respect to @xmath18 .",

    "the eigenvectors can be constructed explicitly .    using the mixed coordinate components @xmath27 and @xmath28 as variables when the metric is not diagonal gives complicated source terms in the @xmath27 evolution equations , because the @xmath27 are no longer pure derivatives .",
    "another possibility is to take as the variables the components of an orthonormal triad and the projection of the extrinsic curvature onto the triad ( or the ashtekar variables @xcite ) .",
    "the triad formalism , because the extrinsic curvature tensor projected on the triad is symmetric , has fewer variables than the mixed coordinate component formalism . in neither case",
    "would the variables be simply related to the eigenvectors of the characteristic matrix when the metric is non - diagonal or the triad vectors are not along the coordinate directions ; thus , there is no obvious advantage to trying to generalize our mixed variables in 1d to generic 2d and 3d calculations .",
    "however , we plan to explore these questions further .    our approach to dynamic gauge conditions , namely , implementing a simple hyperbolic evolution during each time step , then resetting the lapse and the shift between time steps , is general .",
    "a hyperbolic evolution during each time step allows the use of flux - based wave decomposition numerical methods .",
    "a long - term strictly hyperbolic evolution , however , is destroyed in all our hyperbolic formulations when we reset the lapse and shift . despite this , resetting the gauge can be used to increase the accuracy and stability of our 1d calculations .",
    "achieving the same goal in 2d or 3d calculations will be more difficult .",
    "there is no one longitudinal direction , and there is not enough gauge freedom to control the longitudinal components of the metric and extrinsic curvature for all directions .",
    "what gauge resetting conditions are most effective in 2d and 3d remains an open question .",
    "our boundary condition results indicate that simple outgoing wave boundary conditions based on the eigenmodes of the characteristic matrix are not valid in general and are inconsistent with the constraint equations .",
    "on the other hand , extrapolation ( in particular , quadratic extrapolation ) is a numerically dangerous procedure .",
    "although one can use constraint extrapolation to constrain certain linear combinations of the variables , this technique is likely to be less effective in higher dimensions than in 1d because the number of variables increases more rapidly than the number of constraints . using an outgoing wave boundary condition based on the weyl tensor to further constrain the variables",
    "is problematic in the general case . while the peeling theorem @xcite in an asymptotically flat spacetime does show that the incoming wave projection of the weyl tensor falls off much more rapidly than the outgoing wave projection in the wave zone",
    ", one can not assume that the outgoing wave dominates in 3d numerical relativity calculations , which typically have to be truncated at best in the inner part of the wave zone .",
    "the ingoing part of the weyl tensor contains non - radiative quasi - static quadrupole moment contributions which can not be assumed to vanish .    the flux - based wave decomposition numerical methods we have presented for hyperbolic formulations of the einstein equations are completely generalizable , and should prove useful for calculations in black hole and brill wave spacetimes where the eigenvectors and eigenvalues have significant spatial variation .",
    "we hope to extend our exploration of hyperbolic methods to include the use of limiters and upwind differencing .",
    "limiters will be used to suppress short wavelength numerical instabilities . with upwind differencing",
    ", one does not need ghost cells at the apparent horizon boundary of an excised black hole , where the eigenmodes are purely ingoing .    in conclusion",
    ", we have developed basic methodologies for hyperbolic formulations of the einstein equations , which improve accuracy and stability in 1d , and which we think merit further exploration in the context of numerical relativity calculations of more substantial physical interest .",
