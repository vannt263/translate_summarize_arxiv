    "a _ partition _ of a number @xmath4 is a sequence @xmath5 such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 . to indicate that @xmath8 is a partition of @xmath2 we write @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the number of partitions of  @xmath2 . by our definition",
    ", @xmath10 is the unique partition of @xmath11 .",
    "the problem of finding asymptotic estimates for @xmath1 was introduced , and one might reasonably say , solved , by the famous paper of hardy ",
    "ramanujan  @xcite . as well as",
    "their exact formula for  @xmath1 , proved as the original application of the circle - method , their paper also contains several weaker results proved using less sophisticated analytic methods ; for example , that @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the only time they refer to using combinatorial arguments to obtain lower and upper bounds for  @xmath1 is in a footnote in   2.1 , which suggests the strongest such bounds they could prove were of the form @xmath14    our first aim is this paper is to improve on this . in  2 we introduce g.  d.  james abacus notation for partitions and use it to establish an important bijection on partitions ( see  2.2 ) . in ",
    "3 we use this bijection to show that for every @xmath15 there exists a constant @xmath16 such that @xmath17    despite the appearance of an ` @xmath18 ' in this inequality , the proof of is almost entirely combinatorial .",
    "the closest competing result in the literature is due to erds , who gives at the start of @xcite a short elementary proof that @xmath19 where , as before , @xmath13 .",
    "erds result is of course significantly sharper than  , but this improvement comes at the cost of a greater contribution from analysis . for instance , the reader may already have correctly guessed that the identity @xmath20 is needed .    in this context",
    ", we mention that peter neumann ( oxford algebra kinderseminar , january 2003 ) has asked whether there is a combinatorial proof that there exists a constant @xmath21 such that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 . while comes tantalisingly close , the ideas behind it do not appear quite powerful enough to solve his problem .",
    "our second aim is to show that the partition bijection given in  2.2 may be used to solve several other problems in the enumeration of partitions . in our first application",
    "we give a very short proof of an identity originally due to gauss ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* end of  3 ) ) : @xmath24    our main application concerns a result of erds . in the main part of  @xcite , erds uses the same underlying idea as he used to prove , and some more lengthy ( but still elementary ) analysis , to prove that there exists a constant  @xmath25 such that @xmath26 it was already known from the work of hardy and ramanujan @xcite that , but erds methods were not sufficiently powerful to prove this .",
    "later however , newman @xcite gave an elementary proof that if holds for _ some _ constant @xmath27 , then necessarily @xmath28 . in ",
    "4 we use our bijection to give an alternative proof of this result . in length it is comparable with newman s , but it requires considerably less knowledge of analysis , and the motivation is perhaps more apparent .    in  5",
    "we conclude by showing how the abacus may be applied to give exact asymptotic estimates for two other classes of partitions , namely self - conjugate partitions , and partitions with distinct parts .",
    "let @xmath8 be a partition of @xmath2 . a @xmath29-_hook _ in @xmath8 consists of two adjacent nodes in the young diagram of @xmath8 whose removal leaves the diagram of a partition of @xmath30 .",
    "by repeatedly removing @xmath29-hooks from @xmath8 one obtains the _ @xmath29-core _ of  @xmath8 . for example , the @xmath29-core of @xmath31 is @xmath32 , obtained after removing the five  @xmath29-hooks indicated in the diagram below .",
    "[ 0.5]-core of @xmath31.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this diagram , two of the three @xmath29-hooks of the original partition are shown by bold lines .",
    "the remaining lines are @xmath29-hooks of partitions obtained _ en route _ to the @xmath29-core .",
    "it is not obvious that the @xmath29-core of a partition is independent of the manner in which one removes its @xmath29-hooks .",
    "this , and much else besides , can be seen very clearly if we represent partitions using g.  d.  james abacus ( see ( * ? ? ? * ch .  2 , 2627 ) ) . to make this",
    "article self - contained we briefly recall how to operate this piece of apparatus .",
    "( we describe only the ` binary ' @xmath29-runner abacus . )",
    "[ [ section ] ]    let @xmath8 be a partition of @xmath2 . starting in the southwest corner of the young diagram of @xmath8 walk along its rim , heading towards the northeast corner . for each step",
    "right , put a space , indicated  @xmath33 , and for each step up , put a bead , indicated  @xmath34 .",
    "for example , the partition @xmath31 shown above has the sequence @xmath33@xmath34@xmath33@xmath33@xmath34@xmath34@xmath33@xmath33@xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "it will be seen shortly that it is useful to allow such a sequence to begin with any number of beads , and to finish with any number of spaces  these must be stripped off before the partition is recovered .",
    "one then arranges the sequence in two columns , known as the _ runners _ of the abacus . for instance @xmath31",
    "is represented by @xmath35    we call this an _ abacus _ display for the partition @xmath8 .",
    "one sees that @xmath29-hooks in  @xmath8 correspond to beads with a space above them , and that an abacus display for the partition obtained by removing a given @xmath29-hook is obtained by sliding the corresponding bead one space up its runner .",
    "( it is at this point that our convention about initial beads and final spaces is needed . )",
    "the @xmath29-core of @xmath8 is obtained by pushing all the beads up as far as they will go .    to reconstruct the partition @xmath8 from an abacus display for its @xmath29-core we need to know the number of positions down each bead",
    "must be moved .",
    "for example , given the abacus display @xmath36 for the @xmath29-core of @xmath31 , we recover the original partition by moving the bead on the first runner down by  @xmath29 positions , and on the second runner moving the lowest bead down by  @xmath29 positions and the next lowest down by  @xmath37 position .",
    "we record this information in a pair of partitions , @xmath38 , known as the @xmath29-_quotient _ of @xmath8 ; here @xmath39 has @xmath29-quotient @xmath40 .",
    "note that the total number of nodes in @xmath41 and @xmath42 is equal to the total number of @xmath29-hooks removed , so @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath29-core of @xmath8 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    given a partition @xmath8 we may , by adding a bead at the start if necessary , choose an abacus display for @xmath8 so that the @xmath29-core of @xmath8 has at least as many beads on the second runner as the first . with this convention to fix the order of the partitions in the @xmath29-quotient of @xmath8",
    ", the correspondence just described between partitions and pairs @xmath45 of @xmath29-cores and @xmath29-quotients is bijective .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that any @xmath29-core is of the form @xmath46 for some @xmath47 .",
    "therefore we have shown that , if @xmath48 is the number of pairs @xmath38 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are partitions with @xmath49 , then @xmath50 where the sum is over all the non - negative integers @xmath51 such that @xmath52 is a non - negative even integer .",
    "for example , @xmath53 as it is easy to calculate @xmath48 given @xmath54 for @xmath55 using the formula @xmath56 , gives us a recurrence relation for the values of the partition function .",
    "we exploit this recurrence in  3 and  4 below .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    we now prove gauss identity .",
    "let @xmath57 be the ordinary generating function for @xmath58 , @xmath59 since each node in the @xmath29-quotient of a partition contributes two nodes to the original partition , our bijection shows that @xmath60 by , this is equivalent to gauss identity .",
    "it should be said that this is not the first combinatorial proof of gauss identity . in @xcite",
    ", andrews gives a bijective proof ( in the style of franklin s proof of euler s pentagonal number theorem ) that : @xmath61 replacing @xmath62 with @xmath63 gives .",
    "another strategy is to first give a combinatorial proof of jacobi s triple product identity , as done for example in ; from jacobi s identity , it only takes a simple specialisation to get  .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    we conclude this section by remarking that the bijection we have described may be thought as being between the set of all partitions , and the set of all oriented binary trees with vertices labelled by members of @xmath64 , with the property that if two leaves are connected to the same node , they are not both labelled by 0 . for example , the @xmath29-core and @xmath29-quotient of @xmath31 may be represented by the diagram below .    here",
    "the upper ` @xmath29 ' records the number of rows ( or columns ) in the @xmath29-core of @xmath31 . iterating the process , we find that @xmath31 is represented by the oriented binary tree shown below .",
    "the corresponding formulation of gauss identity is the attractive @xmath65",
    "by counting only partitions of @xmath66 with @xmath29-core @xmath10 and @xmath29-quotient @xmath67 where both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are partitions of @xmath68 , we obtain the inequality @xmath69 .",
    "an immediate consequence is that @xmath70 given @xmath71 , we may choose a power of @xmath72 , say @xmath73 , such that @xmath74 . since @xmath58 is an increasing function , @xmath75 , and",
    "so @xmath76 it seems striking that such a simple argument gives a lower bound which , while far from optimal , is still of the right asymptotic form .",
    "marti ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.1 ) ) has shown that , with a little more analysis , and the use of a computer to check small cases , one can obtain the significantly stronger lower bound @xmath77    the next lemma shows how our bijection may be applied to give an upper bound .",

    "hence @xmath86 which completes the inductive step .",
    "the reader will see that we have been very crude in taking @xmath2 as an upper bound for the number of summands in  there appears to be no advantage in being any more precise at this point",
