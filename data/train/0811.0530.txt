    "the modified hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) has been proposed in studies of structural instabilities of two - dimensional systems .",
    "the singlet - triplet gap ( `` spin gap '' ) has been studied by various methods :    * nonlinear @xmath14 model as a low energy effective theory ( ) , ( ) * modified spin wave theory ( ) , ( ) * cluster expansion up to fourth order starting from @xmath15 , i.e. isolated plaquettes ( )    in the spin-@xmath10 case , the model ( [ h0 ] ) is expected ( ) to have a quantum phase transition at a critical value @xmath16 is related to the parameter @xmath17 introduced in ( ) by @xmath18 , which is signalled by a vanishing singlet - triplet gap for @xmath19 .",
    "the results of these works are :    * no phase transition for the spin @xmath10 case in the nonlinear @xmath14 model ( ) for any @xmath20 .",
    "* @xmath21 for the modified spin wave theory [ versus @xmath22 in linear spin wave theory ( ) ] . * @xmath23 for the cluster expansion . * a value @xmath24 was obtained by means of ising series expansions ( ) .",

    "( ) start from singlet ( @xmath29 ) and triplet ( @xmath30 ) plaquette states .",
    "excited states @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are absolutely necessary to generate interactions , since singlets alone can not interact due to total spin conservation .    in a recent paper ( ) , we have studied how interactions on the 4 plaquette compound - depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] - are created by single plaquette excitations .",
    "the conservation of total spin at each interaction point is implemented by means of the wigner - eckart theorem for the transition matrix elements @xmath34 they can be expressed in terms of a clebsch - gordan coefficient and one reduced matrix element @xmath35 .",
    "the latter only depends on the initial and final plaquette spin @xmath36 and the triplet operator @xmath37 at site @xmath38 .",
    "the phase @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) results from the transformation properties of the spin operator @xmath37 under the group @xmath42 . the interaction between neighbouring plaquettes can be traced back to the product of reduced matrix elements at sites @xmath38 and @xmath43 ( fig . [ fig_2 ] )        @xmath44    quintuplet excitations ( @xmath45 ) have not been considered in ref .",
    "we want to stress here that triplet - quintuplet transitions are large - comparable with singlet - triplet transitions .",
    "it is shown in ( ) that the gaps ( singlet - triplet and triplet - quintuplet ) decrease in the renormalization process .",
    "we will see in this paper that the inclusion of quintuplet excitations will move the critical value @xmath16 substantially to a lower value .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ sec2 ] we summarize the details of the real space renormalization group approach in @xmath7 models .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we evaluate the renormalization group flow for various couplings and gaps .    in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the deconfinement of the ground state wavefunction for @xmath46 .",
    "in section [ sec5 ] we present a finite size analysis of the singlet - triplet gap in both regimes : @xmath47 ( confined ) , @xmath48 ( deconfined ) .",
    "section [ sec6 ] is devoted to the staggered magnetization .",
    "in ( ) we first studied the interaction matrices @xmath49 of the four plaquette system ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) in the sectors with total spin @xmath50 .",
    "the elements of the interaction matrices are fixed on one hand by the clebsch - gordan coefficients , which arise in the construction of eigenstates with total spin @xmath50 ( on the 4-plaquette system ) and the evaluation of the wigner - eckart theorem ( [ wet ] ) for the transition matrix elements . on the other hand @xmath49 only depends on the following couplings @xmath51 and gaps @xmath52 we have factored out from the couplings ( [ coupl2])-([coupl4 ] ) the `` fundamental '' interaction @xmath53 which is induced by the singlet - triplet transitions on the plaquette . in appendix",
    "( ) one can find the explicit form of the interaction matrices @xmath54 ( for @xmath12 ! ) @xmath32 under the premise that on the four plaquettes only rotational symmetric configurations with singlets , triplets and at most one quintuplet contribute . in this case",
    "the dimensions @xmath55 of the interaction matrices @xmath54 turn out to be @xmath56 the factor @xmath0 in ( [ h0 ] ) is taken into account in the interaction matrices @xmath57 by a rescaling of the normalized gaps ( [ scgap1 ] ) , ( [ scgap2 ] ) whereas the couplings ( [ coupl2])-([coupl4 ] ) remain unchanged .",
    "having constructed in this way the interaction matrices @xmath58 on an @xmath59 cluster ( @xmath4 ) from the ground states on an @xmath60 cluster , we turned to the question , whether it is possible in general to construct the interaction matrix @xmath61 , @xmath32 from the corresponding quantities of a @xmath62 cluster .",
    "this is indeed possible under the assumption that the low energy states on the ( @xmath63)-cluster can be built up again solely from singlet , triplet , quintuplet ground states on @xmath3-clusters .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence only appears in a renormalization of the couplings ( [ coupl2])-([coupl4 ] ) and energy differences ( [ scgap2 ] ) , ( [ scgap2 ] )    here , we refer to ( ) @xmath64eqns .",

    "note , that @xmath0 does not appear in the first group of equations , whereas the remaining two ( scaled energy differences ) are linear in @xmath0 .",
    "each step @xmath66 in the renormalization procedure demands the diagonalization of the interaction matrices @xmath61 , @xmath32 : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 with the largest eigenvalues @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 enter in the quantities @xmath73 according to the bilinear forms : @xmath74 the contraction @xmath75 , etc .",

    "we start with the singlet - triplet gap @xmath79 , which yields the signature for long range order : from fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] we see , that there are two different regimes :    * @xmath80 + here the singlet - triplet gap approaches zero with increasing system size .",
    "for @xmath12 we are close to zero already on small systems for @xmath81 .",
    "for decreasing @xmath0 , @xmath82 increases and seems to diverge for @xmath83 . * below this critical value ( @xmath46 ) the singlet - triplet gap @xmath79 does not converge to zero anymore .",
    "note also that there is a change in the curvature of @xmath79 with @xmath3 , which is for large @xmath3 convex if @xmath84 but concave if @xmath85 .",
    "this allows for a very precise determination of @xmath86    let us next turn to the coupling ratio @xmath87 [ ( 6.1 ) in ( ) ] . as function of @xmath3 this quantity",

    "it was pointed out in section [ sec2 ] , that the renormalization group procedure demands in each step @xmath66 the diagonalization ( [ d0])-([d2 ] ) of the interaction matrices .",
    "we only keep those eigenvectors ( @xmath94 ) with largest eigenvalue ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we want to discuss now the physical meaning of the eigenvector components : @xmath95 in the orthonormal basis @xmath96 in the singlet sector - defined in table ii of ref .",

    "[ fig_7 ] .",
    "@xmath103 decreases with @xmath46 and defines the largest cluster size ( @xmath104 ) which is still confined .    in summary we can say : in the two - dimensional system of interacting plaquettes defined in ( [ h0 ] ) we observed two phases .",
    "* for @xmath80 , there is a confined phase , where the ground state does not factorize into finite @xmath3-clusters ( @xmath4 ) but forms one infinite cluster in the thermodynamical limit @xmath105 .",
    "the vanishing of the singlet - triplet gap is the characteristic signature of this phase .",
    "* in the deconfined phase @xmath106 the ground state factorizes into finite clusters @xmath107 where @xmath103 defines the maximal size of clusters and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] .",

    "[ fig_8 ] .    in the confined regime",
    "@xmath80 all the curves approach a common limit @xmath115 which leads to a universal exponent ( [ universal_exp ] ) @xmath116    in the deconfined regime @xmath48 we find a nonvanishing singlet - triplet gap : @xmath117 with a finite - size correction @xmath118 which follows from the difference @xmath119 of the largest eigenvalues @xmath71 , @xmath70 in the triplet and singlet sector and the fundamental coupling @xmath120 ( [ int_a ] ) , which can be extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] .",

    "we find spectacular differences in the confinement ( @xmath136 ) and deconfinement ( @xmath46 ) regime , which allows - for a given truncation scheme - for an extremely precise determination of the critical coupling @xmath16 in all these quantities .",
    "this means , that the interaction matrices @xmath61 , @xmath32 ( [ d0])-([d2 ] ) and thereby the renormalization group equations [ ( 6.2)-(6.6 ) in ( ) ] depend on @xmath0 in an extremely sensitive way .",
    "the reason is a feedback between the scaled energy differences @xmath137 - which enter in the diagonals of @xmath61 - and the largest eigenvalues @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( [ d0])-([d2 ] ) .",
    "this feedback also leads to a dramatic change in the eigenstates @xmath94 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 . e.g. the square of the first component @xmath64([sigma_i ] ) for @xmath138 $ ] @xmath97 in the singlet eigenvector @xmath94 changes completely if we go from the confined ( @xmath80 ) to the deconfined ( @xmath46 ) regime . in the deconfined regime @xmath97 is almost one , which means , that the ground state factorizes into 4 noninteracting singlets . in the confined phase @xmath97",

    "excitations of cluster spins are necessary to induce cluster - cluster interactions .",
    "the vanishing of the singlet - triplet gap - as it is observed in the confinement regime @xmath80 - is a consequence of the cluster - cluster interactions induced by cluster excitations ( triplet and quintuplet ) .",

    "therefore , the difference in the two values ( [ jc_neu ] ) reflects the effect of rotational symmetric excited states on the 4 plaquette cluster with one quintuplet .",
