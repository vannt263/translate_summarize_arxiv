    "neutron capture cross sections are one of the essential nuclear inputs for studies of r - process nucleosynthesis . as this astrophysical process , which produces about half of the heavy elements in the universe , runs through nuclei with extreme neutron excesses ,",
    "most of the needed cross sections are not experimentally known and have to be modelled .",
    "such estimates are usually done on the basis of the statistical hauser - feshbach @xcite model and require , as one of the important ingredients , the modelling of the electromagnetic transition strength from nuclear states above the neutron threshold .",
    "often dipole transitions contribute dominantly to the cross sections . in the absence of experimental data ,",
    "these dipole strength distributions for neutron - rich nuclei have been conventionally described by lorentzians with an energy- or temperature - dependent width @xcite and parameters derived from data for stable nuclei .",
    "obviously deviations from the parametrized lorentzian at energies around the neutron threshold can lead to significant modifications of the neutron capture cross sections . as noted first by goriely @xcite",
    ", such effects can arise from the so - called pygmy resonance which leads to an enhancement of the low - lying e1 strength , potentially in the astrophysically important energy range .",
    "in fact , an enhancement of the e1 strength at excitation energies @xmath1 below 10  mev has been experimentally observed for neutron - rich nuclei relative to the one for stable nuclei .",
    "prominent examples are the tin isotopes where the neutron - rich nuclei @xmath2sn exhibit a noticeable portion of the total e1 strength at @xmath3  mev , in contrast to the stable isotopes @xmath4sn @xcite . theoretically these tendencies are well reproduced by calculations based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) on top of the hartree - fock plus bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( hf - bcs ) @xcite or of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite approaches and by the relativistic qrpa ( rqrpa ) calculations @xcite and are usually explained as so - called pygmy resonances in which the excess neutrons oscillate against the isospin - saturated core .",
    "significant progress has been achieved very recently by extending the rqrpa by the quasiparticle - phonon coupling model using the relativistic quasiparticle time blocking approximation ( rqtba ) . as it has been demonstrated in @xcite",
    ", this extended approach reproduces the experimental e1 strength distributions in general very well , inluding the observed low - lying strength it has been also found that isotopic dependence of the excitation energy and the integrated strength of the pygmy dipole resonance agrees well with previous theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that once the theoretical strength distributions are corrected for the experimental detector response and in particular for the fact that coulomb dissociation experiments can only access strength above the neutron threshold , the data for @xmath5sn and @xmath6sn  @xcite are nicely reproduced .",
    "this motivates us to use this model to calculate the e1 strength distributions for the chains of tin and nickel isotopes , including nuclei close and on the r - process path for which data do not exist , yet .",
    "the focus of our studies is on the effect of enhanced low - lying dipole strength on neutron capture cross sections , in particular for neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "our calculations are based on the statistical model which we briefly describe in the next section . in section 3",
    "we present the rqtba dipole strength functions and compare them with standard lorentzian parametrizations  @xcite and with the qrpa calculations of ref .",

    "both multipolarities usually dominate for neutron capture reactions at astrophysical energies .    in general",
    ", the strength function depends on the initial and final states .",
    "however , in practical applications , one usually adopts the brink - axel hypothesis which assumes that the strength function is independent of the detailed structure of the initial state and consequently depends only on @xmath36 and not on @xmath16  @xcite . assuming that the photoabsorption process does not depend on the spin of the final state , it is possible to relate the cross section , @xmath37 , to the @xmath32-strength function :    @xmath38    according to eq .",

    "[ fe1 ] shows the dipole @xmath32 strength functions for the four different models and selected tin isotopes .",
    "we note that models a and d reproduce the known photoabsorption cross section data for tin isotopes quite well @xcite . while the parametrized strength function of ref .",
    "@xcite agrees nicely with the microscopic @xmath65sn strength functions , it predicts a centroid energy which is somewhat higher for the neutron - rich tin isotope @xmath6sn than obtained in the other models .    comparing the various model predictions",
    "it is most striking that the microscopic model predicts quite noticeable nuclear structure effects which result in a rather strong fragmentation of the strength function .",
    "this is mainly due to the quasiparticle - phonon coupling explicitly considered in the rqtba approach  @xcite . comparing the microscopic strength functions ( model a ) with the lorentzian approximation of model b",
    ", we note that for most nuclei the parametrization overestimates the microscopic strength function at low energies , say @xmath66  mev .",
    "this indicates that the empirical energy - dependence of the width parameter @xcite is not supported by the microscopic model .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the qrpa results which are generally slightly smaller than the rqtba results at the lowest energies .",
    "the standard parametrization utilized in @xcite agrees quite well with the model b parametrization . however , with increasing neutron excess this model predicts the centroid at higher energies than the other models .",
    "consequently , the @xmath32 strength function for @xmath67sn in model c is smaller at low energies than in the other models .    as the rqtba model includes phonon couplings which are absent in the qrpa model it resolves more nuclear structure details",
    "this can lead to fluctuations in the @xmath32 strength function around the neutron threshold and below .",
    "an example is given by the nucleus @xmath65sn ( see fig .",
    "[ fe1 ] ) where the rqtba model predicts a mild enhancement of the strength just at the neutron threshold which is absent in the qrpa model and , of course , in the parametrizations of models b and c. as the neutron separation energies move to lower energies with increasing neutron excess within a chain of isotopes , low - lying e1 strength as observed experimentally for the tin isotopes @xmath0sn and found within our microscopic rqtba approach for neutron - rich nuclei can influence the @xmath32 strength function around the neutron threshold significantly .",
    "a prominent example is @xmath6sn where the rqtba approach predicts a strong enhancement of the e1 strength around the neutron separation energy of @xmath68  mev .",
    "such an increased strength is not predicted by the other models used in this paper ( the relativistic qrpa calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite predict also additional strength at low energies ) and , as we will see below , has a noticeable effect on the neutron capture cross sections . for @xmath67sn",
    "the rqtba model also predicts a strong fragmentation of the @xmath32 strength at low energies @xmath69  mev with enhanced strength compared to the strengths of the other models .",
    "however , for this nucleus the neutron threshold is already quite low ( @xmath70  mev ) and this enhancement will only have modest effect on the cross sections .    -reactions on various tin isotopes based on e1 strength functions as derived in different models , see fig .",
    "[ fe1 ] and text.[sn - cs ] ]    by inserting the @xmath32 strength functions into eqs .",

    "[ sn - cs ] for neutron energies of up to 20 mev ( note that the maximum neutron energies reached in the r - process discussed below are of the order of @xmath72 kev ) . in order to understand the impact of various magnitudes of @xmath32 strengths it is necessary to realize what the relevant @xmath32-ray energies are .",
    "it is well known that capture reactions proceeding via the compound reaction mechanism result in a @xmath32-ray cascade with a dominant contribution coming from @xmath32 rays with only a few mev , below the neutron separation energy @xmath73 .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming the validity of the brink - axel hypothesis and a lorentzian parametrization of the dipole strength , has shown that this also holds for neutron - rich targets with dominant e1 strength leading to levels at 3 - 4 mev below @xmath73 unless the density of levels accessible by e1 transition is low . in the latter case ,",
    "@xmath32 transitions with the maximally possible energy of @xmath74 may dominate .",
    "this nicely explains the dependences we find in our calculations .",
    "for the cases of neutron captures on @xmath75sn and @xmath76sn the dominating @xmath32 transitions display an energy of @xmath77 mev with dominant e1 transition endpoints at @xmath78 mev below @xmath79 .",
    "scanning through @xmath80 , we can nicely see in figs .",
    "[ fe1],[sn - cs ] how the larger strength functions of the two parametrized descriptions ( models b and c ) result in larger cross sections than those obtained with the microscopic approaches rqtba and qrpa ( models a and d ) , until the predictions converge close to @xmath73 .",
    "the rqtba model predicts a strong fragmentation of the dipole strength at low energies .",
    "however , this is not seen in the cross sections because the relevant range of available @xmath32 energies averages and smoothes the impact of the fluctuations .",
    "the small kink appearing in the @xmath76sn cross section at @xmath81 mev is due to the opening of the @xmath82 channel .",
    "consistent with  @xcite , we find a different behavior in the cross sections of @xmath83sn .",
    "the low level density of the doubly magic compound ( and final ) nucleus @xmath6sn causes the dominance of @xmath32 transitions directly to the ground state , with @xmath84 .",
    "up to @xmath85  mev the influence of the rqtba pygmy peak explains why the rqtba yields the by far largest cross sections up to that energy . above that energy ,",
    "the rqtba @xmath32 strength drops below the strengths predicted by the other models and consequently the resulting cross section becomes the smallest . after another @xmath86 mev ( note that fig .",
    "1 uses a linear and fig .",
    "2 a logarithmic energy scale ) , the rqtba predicts a larger @xmath32 strength again and consequently its respective cross section becomes the largest again .",
    "interestingly , a second effect is overlaid on top of the general strength function behavior and giving rise to the decrease in cross sections found for all models around 2 mev neutron energy .",
    "the level density description  @xcite predicts a relatively low density of negative parity states at excitation energies around 9 mev in @xmath6sn . in consequence ,",
    "magnetic dipole transitions to the low - lying positive parity states dominate ( not shown in fig .",
    "this is an example for the importance of the complete inclusion of parity - dependent level densities .    except for the parity effect ,",
    "the behavior of the @xmath87sn@xmath88 ) cross section can be explained similarly to the one of @xmath83sn .",
    "the level density below @xmath73 is very low for such a neutron - rich nucleus and therefore the relevant @xmath32 energies are @xmath84 .",
    "the strong pygmy peak predicted by the rqtba is also clearly seen in the cross section .",
    "smaller fluctuations are dampened and the general strong decrease in the cross section at the high energy end is typical for hauser - feshbach cross sections , as in the other reactions considered here .",
    "in addition , for @xmath87sn we find that the m1 contribution to the capture cross section exceeds the dipole part at low neutron energies ( say @xmath89 kev ) .",
    "thus , at these energies the total cross sections are less affected by the differences in the dipole strength functions . however , our statistical model code uses a rather simple description of m1 transitions based on a single particle treatment  @xcite . a more appropriate treatment , which includes the concentration of the m1 strength around @xmath9010  mev due to spin excitations and in addition considers the pronounced orbital contribution seen in deformed nuclei ( scissors mode  @xcite ) is called for .",
    "k for tin isotopes as calculated within models b , c , and d relative to those obtained in model a ( rqtba ) .",
    "all the calculations consider only e1 gamma transitions . for descriptions of the models , see text.[sn - ratios ] ]    the classical r - process operates at a typical stellar temperature of order @xmath91  k  @xcite . to estimate which impact the enhanced low - energy dipole strength could have on neutron capture rates under astrophysical conditions",
    ", we have calculated the stellar neutron capture rate @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the neutron capture cross section , @xmath94 is the relative velocity of the fusing nuclei in the initial channel and the symbol @xmath95 indicates proper averaging over the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distributions of the two nuclei at the stellar temperature and accounting for the thermal population of excited states . in fig .",
    "[ sn - ratios ] we compare ratios of neutron capture rates as obtained in the four different models at a temperature of @xmath96 k. the capture rates have been computed neglecting m1 transitions due to their rather simple treatment in our statistical code ( see paragraph above ) .",
    "we observe that rates calculated with the parametrized e1 strengths are usually larger than our rqtba results with the noticeable exception for the isotopes @xmath0sn ( capturing the neutron on @xmath97sn ) . with the additional observation that the other microscopically calculated strength functions ( qrpa , model d ) generally predicts smaller rates than the parametrization models one might conclude that the parametrization of the dipole strength functions with the energy dependence as defined above seems to predict too large strength at low gamma energies ( except for the most neutron - rich tin isotope , @xmath67sn , considered in this work ) and hence overestimates the rates , compared to microscopic models .",
    "interestingly , we do not observe by comparison of the four models that the low - lying strength is more important in neutron - rich nuclei as , for example , the parametrized strength of model b exceeds the rqtba results by about the same amount in the neutron deficient and stable tin isotopes as it does in the very neutron - rich ones ( @xmath98sn ) .",
    "k for nickel isotopes as calculated within models b , c , and d relative to those obtained in model a ( rqtba ) .",
    "all the calculations consider only e1 gamma transitions . for descriptions of the models , see text.[ni - ratios ] ]    we have also performed calculations of dipole strength functions , cross sections and neutron capture rates at @xmath99 k for the even neutron - rich nickel isotopes @xmath100ni .",
    "a comparison of the rates obtained in our four different models is shown in fig .",
    "[ ni - ratios ] .",
    "the findings are quite similar to those for the tin isotopes .",
    "for all isotopes the rates calculated with the parametrized dipole strength ( models b and c ) exceeds those obtained on the basis of the rqtba strength functions , again pointing to a non - adequate description of the low - lying strength by the energy dependent width parameter as chosen in  @xcite . except for the capture on @xmath101ni ,",
    "the agreement between the two microscopic approaches ( models a and d ) is quite satisfactory .",
    "the lorentzian parametrization slightly overestimates the microscopic rates .",
    "we note , however , that for the heaviest nickel nuclei the parametrization used within ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the centroid of the giant dipole resonance at slightly higher energies . if corrected , the downwards shift in energy would result in somewhat larger rates .    in general , our calculations for the capture",
    "rates on tin and nickel isotopes show a rather close agreement between the models suggesting that the enhanced low - lying dipole strength predicted by theoretical models and experimentally observed for selected nuclei has only modest influence on the neutron capture rates .",
    "the largest effect we find for the capture on the tin isotopes @xmath97sn ( caused by low - lying dipole strength in @xmath0sn ) where our microscopic rqtba model predicts noticeable enhanced strength just around the energies of the neutron threshold , leading to an increase in the capture rate by factors 25 compared to the other models considered here .",
    "the coincidence that the enhanced e1 strength lies around the neutron threshold in @xmath6sn and a large portion of the transitions goes to the daughter ground state ( due to suppression of excited states at modest excitation energies in this double - magic nucleus ) results in a large enhancement of the reaction rate in the rqtba model compared to the other models . as the rqtba strength function for @xmath6sn nicely agrees with data ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this change in the capture rate should be adopted in future r - process simulations .",
    "we have obtained e1 strength functions for nickel and tin isotopes based on the microscopic rqtba approach which has been proven previously to give a good description of data , including those for the neutron - rich tin isotopes @xmath0sn .",
    "these data show e1 strengths at energies around the neutron threshold which are enhanced compared to the expectations from a lorentzian parametrization of the giant resonance .",
    "as it has been pointed out before that such enhanced dipole strengths could have noticeable effects on neutron capture rates for r - process nuclei , we have calculated the respective capture cross sections for the relevant nickel and tin isotopes ( @xmath102ni and @xmath103sn ) and have compared the rqtba results with rates obtained either within the non - relativistic qrpa on the basis of hartree - fock plus bcs calculations or by empirical parametrizations . usually we find rather good agreement between the two microscopic models .",
    "noticeable exceptions are @xmath97sn , and in particular the capture rates to @xmath6sn are noticeably larger within the rqtba model than in all other models , which is caused by the enhanced dipole strength in this nucleus at energies above the neutron threshold .",
    "we note , however , that our calculation of the capture rates are based on the brink - axel hypothesis , which is common in statistical model evaluations of neutron capture rates for r - process applications . within this hypothesis",
    "an enhanced dipole strength around the neutron threshold translates to enhanced neutron capture cross sections only if transitions to the ground state dominate .",
    "if the capture leads to excited states instead the strength function at appropriate lower energies is relevant .",
    "however , the transition strength for excited states could be different than for the ground state at the moderate energies relevant to neutron capture , invalidating the brink - axel hypothesis .",
    "consequently , tests of this hypothesis for dipole transitions , similar to those performed for gamow - teller transitions in ref .",
    "@xcite are welcome .",
    "two final remarks are in order . at first , the rqtba model predicts fragmentation and low - lying strengths also in the neutron - rich isotopes , however , not at the low energies close to the neutron threshold . whether further correlations beyond the rqtba model will further push strength to lower energies and hence might enhance the dipole cross sections at low neutron energies is an open question and",
    "must wait until appropriate nuclear models can be applied to such nuclei .",
    "secondly , we have also calculated the contributions of other multipoles to the neutron capture rate and find that for the tin isotopes beyond @xmath6sn , which have quite low neutron thresholds , m1 transitions dominate in our calculations making the observed differences in the dipole cross sections unimportant for the total cross sections due to our use of parity - dependent level densities  @xcite .",
    "however , we note that our statistical model code describes m1 transitions in the so - called single - particle treatment . the calculation of the m1 transitions should generally be improved by using m1 strength functions which resemble the experimentally observed energy distribution with strong spin contributions around excitation energies of order 710  mev and orbital contributions at low energies , including the pronounced scissors mode  @xcite in deformed nuclei at excitation energies of @xmath1043  mev , i.e. around neutron threshold energies in very neutron - rich nuclei .",
