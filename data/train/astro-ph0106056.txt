    "properly accounting for the effects of dust upon light from galaxies is crucial to our understanding of galaxy evolution , of the interplay between stars and interstellar medium within galaxies , of the most distant galaxies ( whose uv radiation is mostly self - absorbed ) , and of the cumulative absorption from foreground galaxies which may affect the observability of high - redshift qsos .",
    "galaxy superpositions have recently been exploited to directly measure the dust content and distribution within galaxies , free of many of the assumptions about internal structure required by techniques that use only a galaxy s own light .",
    "we have pursued this approach in a series of papers , successively refining its scope for mapping dust within galaxies .",
    "white & keel ( 1992 ) used ground - based imaging of am1316 - 241 to map the extinction in and around a prominent spiral arm , showing that interarm extinction can be small . using a larger sample of 12 suitable backlit spirals , white , keel , & conselice ( 2000 ; wkc ) found this to be representative behavior ; arms and resonance rings can have substantial opacities ( @xmath4 ) at any radius , while interarm extinction shows a roughly exponential radial distribution and reaches @xmath5 only within about @xmath6 .",
    "these results also showed extinction curves greyer than the galactic mean , indicative of unresolved dust structure .",
    "this was borne out by hst imaging of am0500 - 620 and am1316 - 241 ( keel & white 2001 ) , for which the extinction behavior is much like the milky way s when measured at resolutions of 30 pc .",
    "similar behavior was found for dust lanes in the outer disk of ngc 2207 projected in front of its ocular companion ic 2163 ( elmegreen et al .",
    "combining dust masses estimated from optical absorption in backlit spirals with iso and jcmt infrared data to estimate thermal - emission masses , domingue et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that these estimates are in good agreement , limiting the role of very cold dust or small dense clumps .",
    "domingue et al .",
    "( 2000 ) added to the sample of workable galaxies for these studies by using spectroscopy to split the light from overlapping pairs of spirals , based on their redshift differences , finding concordance with results from spiral - elliptical pairs .",
    "while it violates some of our precepts for a full analysis using the partial overlap technique , the unique galaxy superposition ngc 3314 allows us to probe extinction closer to the nucleus of a spiral galaxy than in any other nearby galaxy pair .",
    "it also allows us to abandon the symmetry contraints that make grand - design spirals the most amenable to our earlier partial overlap analyses , since ngc 3314a has its spiral pattern outlined as much by the dust pattern as by bright stellar associations ( as noted by sandage 1961 for ngc 253 ) .",
    "ngc 3314 , located in the direction of the hydra i cluster ( abell 1060 ) , consists of an sc galaxy ( ngc3314a ) in front of an earlier - type sb system ( ngc 3314b ) , with their nuclei separated by only @xmath7 .",
    "the line - of - sight separation is poorly known , since both galaxies have redshifts within the range of the velocity dispersion of abell 1060 .",
    "we derive heliocentric central values of @xmath82834 and 4665 km s@xmath9 for ngc 3314a and ngc 3314b respectively , in good agreement with the values found from slit spectroscopy by schweizer & thonnard ( 1985 ) .",
    "there are additional galaxies , including the giant spiral ngc 3312 , at redshifts very close to ngc 3314a , and some evidence for h i tails indicates that these galaxies form a distinct , weakly interacting group in the foreground of abell 1060 ( mcmahon et al .",
    "if so , this group s redshift distance would place it at about 35 mpc , while the mean redshift of 3400 km s@xmath9 for abell 1060 puts its core at 42 mpc ( we take h@xmath10 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 throughout ) .",
    "the core radius of abell 1060 is much smaller than this difference of 7 mpc , so that essentially any separation ranging from small values to 7 mpc is possible .",
    "the lack of substantial distortion in the outer isophotes of ngc 3314b suggests that the two systems are separated by at least the sum of their radii to detectable surface - brightness levels .",
    "this matters mostly in evaluating the possible contribution of scattered background light to what we measure , as outlined in the appendix of wkc .",
    "the velocity field in h@xmath0 will allow us to place limits on the role of scattering in the light reaching us from ngc 3314b .",
    "the dust in ngc 3314a has been examined previously , using ground - based imaging , by keel ( 1983 ) and wkc , and via spectroscopy to look for excess balmer decrement by james & puxley ( 1993 ) .",
    "the improvement in structure discrimination , and more accurate recovery of the extinction curve , shown by comparing ground - based and hst observations of spirals backlit by ellipticals ( keel & white 2001 ) suggested that similarly spectacular gains could be realized for the entire dust pattern in ngc 3314a .",
    "we describe here the results of multicolor hst wfpc2 imaging of ngc 3314 , supplemented by ground - based @xmath11 imaging and spectroscopic mapping , which not only show the reddening curve of material in the sc foreground galaxy , but let us derive the extinction within half a kiloparsec of its nucleus .",
    "radial locations of features have been derived with a geometrical model based on the new h@xmath0 velocity fields , which gives parameters for ngc 3314a intermediate between the results from optical rotation curves by schweizer & thonnard ( 1985 ) and the h i velocity field by mcmahon et al .",
    "we take an inclination of @xmath12 to the line of sight , and a major axis position angle of @xmath13 ( as set out in section 2.3 ) . for conversion to linear radius within ngc 3314a , we adopt a distance of 36 mpc , or a scale of 172 pc / arcsecond .",
    "we obtained f450w ( @xmath14 ) and f814w ( @xmath15 ) images of ngc 3314 under go program 6438 , using wfpc2 on 5 april 1999 , with total exposure times 2600 and 2400 seconds respectively , split into halves for cosmic - ray rejection .",
    "these filters were selected , as in keel & white ( 2001 ) , to give a long wavelength baseline with high quantum efficiency and without including strong emission lines .",
    "the orientation ( u3 position angle 84.9@xmath16 ) was specified so as to place a bright star , superimposed on the northwest end of ngc 3314b , on another ccd so that charge bleeding or scattered starlight would not compromise the galaxies image .",
    "we deal here with data from the wf3 ccd , including the whole region of dust backlighting .",
    "the b image was supplemented with data from the hubble heritage observations obtained on 10 march 2000 , adding 1400 seconds of exposure in a cosmic - ray split pair .",
    "the orientation was set to be identical for this second observation , and indeed no rotation was needed to combine the images .",
    "an offset of 0.2 pixel in each coordinate was handled by interpolation of the shorter heritage f450w exposure , introducing a small smoothing which has no consequence to our analysis ( since the psf is significantly larger in f814w ) .",
    "1 shows a color composite from both data sets , including as well f555w and f675w images taken for the heritage project ( mapped as green together ) .",
    "we use a @xmath11-band image obtained with the nsfcam imager at the 3-m nasa infrared telescope facility on mauna kea .",
    "the camera was set to deliver @xmath17 pixels for a @xmath18 field , with nearby blank sky used as a flat - field reference and the final mosaic constructed from @xmath19 dither patterns with @xmath20 spacing between pointings .",
    "the total exposure on ngc 3314 was 18 minutes .",
    "photometric calibration was based on ukirt faint standard stars fs21 and fs27 observed before and after ngc 3314 .",
    "star images show a resolution of @xmath21 fwhm for the final image stack .",
    "the final processed image is shown in fig .",
    "2 . with the much better penetration of @xmath22 photons , the background nucleus and",
    "both spirals patterns become evident .      the spectral region including h@xmath0 , [ n ii ] @xmath23 , and [ s ii ] @xmath24 was mapped using the densepak fiber array ( barden , sawyer , & honeycutt 1998 ) at the 3.5 m wiyn telescope during two nights in december 2000 .",
    "the array has fibers with @xmath25 aperture diameter , arranged in a @xmath26 configuration , nominally in hexagonal packing on a @xmath27 triangular grid .",
    "sky subtraction uses four outlying fibers , located about @xmath28 from the array center in diagonal directions with respect to the rectangular array outline .",
    "the major axis of the array was set north - south .",
    "the full spectral range covered was 6010 - 7410    at 0.69    per pixel , sampling an effective resolution of 2.0 pixels or 1.4    fwhm .",
    "seven pointings were obtained .",
    "one set of four 30-minute exposures ( with the last truncated at 20 because of twilight ) was taken in a trapezoidal pattern , parallel to the array packing to fill the fiber gaps .",
    "in addition , a set of 45-minute exposures were obtained centered on the nucleus and at positions offset @xmath20 in each coordinate to the northwest and southeast , roughly along the major axis of ngc 3314b , to complete the kinematic coverage of the system .",
    "reduction included extraction of the fiber spectra to one - dimensional form , with s / n ratio optimized by variance weighting perpendicular to the dispersion , and cosmic - ray rejection based on the ccd noise parameters .",
    "the spectra were rebinned to a common linear wavelength scale to allow sky subtraction .",
    "line wavelengths were measured for each fiber position via the iraf splot task , by gaussian fitting .",
    "two - dimensional maps of emission - line wavelength and intensity were constructed from the fiber measurements , by averaging data from all overlapping positions on a subpixel numerical grid averaged to a pixel spacing of @xmath29 .",
    "velocity fields for the two galaxies separately are shown in fig . 3 for ngc 3314a and fig . 4 for ngc 3314b .",
    "each set of fiber observations began with a pointing visually centered on the nucleus of ngc 3314a in a selected fiber aperture , using a tv view with the fibers back - illuminated .",
    "this introduces about @xmath29 uncertainty in the positioning of the two nights data against each other and with respect to the images .",
    "the various pointings were registered by requiring minimal discontinuities in the velocity field near the center , where the highest - amplitude structure is found .",
    "registration against the hst images assumes that the peak brightness of the nucleus of ngc 3314a occurs when a fiber is geometrically centered on it .",
    "we have derived kinematic estimates for the inclination and orientation of each disk from these data . using the gridded velocity maps",
    ", we applied the approach of warner , wright , & baldwin ( 1973 ) as implemented in code provided by r. buta , in which the geometric parameters ( disk inclination , major - axis orientation , central velocity , and center location ) are varied iteratively to minimize the scatter in the implied ( deprojected ) rotation curve . for ngc 3314a",
    ", we derive an inclination of @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is edge - on ) , major axis position angle @xmath32 , and central velocity @xmath33 km s@xmath9 as observed ( 2834 corrected to heliocentric ) .",
    "the rotation curves are shown in fig .",
    "5 . for the background system ngc 3314b",
    ", we derive an inclination of @xmath34 , position angle of @xmath35 , and observed central velocity @xmath36 km s@xmath9 ( 4665 heliocentric ) .",
    "the best - fitting kinematic center is significantly offset from the near - ir nucleus , lying @xmath29 west and @xmath37 south of the nucleus of ngc 3314a .",
    "part of this offset may result from a bias in the distribution of fitted points , which fill the area to the south more fully and may be affected in particular by the strong extinction right at the foreground nucleus .",
    "adopting these orientations , we extract the individual rotation curves as shown in fig .",
    "they are close matches for the slices shown by schweizer & thonnard 1985 , with the proviso that the central regions in our data will be affected by the limited spatial resolution afforded by @xmath25 fibers and by patchy sampling in ngc3314b .",
    "the small scatter for points in the derived rotation curve of ngc 3314b , away from the nucleus so that patchy sampling or exact centering are not problems , indicates that scattering is not a problem in measuring extinction .",
    "scattered light , presumably strongly variable in intensity as the dust column density changes , would introduce both point - to - point scatter and an overall broadening of the h@xmath0 profile , as light from various parts of ngc 3314b would contribute to the observed spectrum at each point .",
    "we apply four techniques to measure the extinction through ngc 3314a in various regimes . while independent of many of the model assumptions used to measure extinction within a single galaxy , each of these does have certain built - in geometric assumptions , which we summarize as follows .",
    "extinction in the prominent * dust lanes * can be measured with respect to their immediate surroundings ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "this uses interpolation of the background light across the dust lane and a correction for foreground light , derived from appropriate parts of the relevant spiral pattern as seen against empty space .",
    "the only major assumptions here are that background structures are not fortuitously correlated with foreground dust features , and that foreground light is not so distributed as to mask true extinction ( and in a way not seen in `` clean '' foreground arms ) .",
    "the * interlane extinction * can be measured in the outer disk of ngc 3314a , where we see structure in the background disk and thus can be confident that the region is of low extinction . for these , we use the @xmath38 color after correcting for the estimated foreground light , and apply the same slope of the reddening law as found for the discrete dust lanes .",
    "the assumptions going into these measurements are that the interarm dust is not very different from that in the dust lanes ( so we can convert @xmath38 excess into @xmath39 ) , and that the foreground arms seen without backlight are fair samples of their behavior at intermediate , backlit points .",
    "we use h@xmath0 emission from the background system to estimate the effective transmission in the * inner disk*. this can be done only roughly , using the typical correlation between scale lengths in h@xmath0 and the far - red continuum , as noted by ryder & dopita ( 1994 ) .",
    "this gives net transmissions averaged over the @xmath25 scale of our spectroscopic mapping , and the errors will be larger than for the other methods because h@xmath0 will exhibit fine structure that we have no independent way to recover from these data .",
    "given the rather surprising prevalence of detected background h@xmath0 emission , this technique could be substantially improved by mapping in one of the near - ir recombination features such as pa@xmath0 or br@xmath40 .",
    "the reddening toward the * nucleus * of ngc 3314b can be estimated from its color excess in @xmath2 , based on other spirals of similar hubble type .",
    "this assumes , of course , that the color behavior is reasonably well - behaved for various galaxies , which is true for colors this red , and that we can accurately measure both @xmath15 and @xmath11 fluxes in the presence of large and very patchy extinction",
    ".    one important goal of these observations is to combine these techniques to give a nearly complete radial profile of the extinction , both in and between the dusty arms .",
    "our direct extinction measurements will in general be greater than the face - on extinction through the disk ( by a factor of 1.33 for our adopted geometry , the secant of the inclination to the line of sight ) .",
    "the detailed distribution of the dust affects this factor somewhat ; a uniform , vertically stratified layer will obey it exactly , while a collection of isolated clouds sparsely filling the disk volume will follow this behavior in covering factor rather than extinction .",
    "lacking a direct comparison of superimposed and clear views of the two galaxies , we must use more indirect means to estimate extinction in the interlane regions ( where we use  interlane \" to indicate that we are looking between the dust lanes , not necessarily between optically bright spiral features ) .",
    "such regions can be identified in the outer part of ngc 3314a s disk because background spiral structure can be seen through them , except for a small area northwest of its nucleus where the directions of both patterns coincide .",
    "since the dust in the dark lanes follows the milky way reddening law closely ( section 4 ) , we will not be far off in taking this form to derive the ( much smaller ) interarm extinction from color excess .",
    "we look for a color gradient in interlane regions , which are identified from visibility of background structure and lack of dust lanes following the foreground spiral pattern . assuming the background disk to have constant color with radius should give an upper limit on foreground reddening ( hence extinction ) since very few sb galaxies become bluer at smaller radii within the disk .",
    "our best estimate is derived from the slopes of typical color gradients in sb systems , over the @xmath38 baseline which corresponds closely to the wfpc2 filters we used .",
    "we incorporate gradient data from 14 sb galaxies ( excluding strongly barred systems ) from cunow ( 1998 ) and aguerri et al .",
    "we measure the color gradients across the radial range relevant for ngc 3314a , in the range 0.30.6@xmath41 ( where @xmath41 is the radius to the @xmath42 mag arcsec@xmath43 isophote used for the usual @xmath44 diameter measurement ) .",
    "with @xmath41 for each system as the unit of length , the gradients range from @xmath45 for ngc 6970 to + 1.53 for ngc 7753 ( where a positive gradient means the central regions are redder ) . assuming flat color behavior",
    "will then give an upper limit to the color excess in ngc 3314a , while we can rule out the stronger gradients from the observed colors themselves .",
    "the regions selected for interlane measurements are shown in fig 6 .",
    "we attempted to find sets of regions that follow obvious color structure in the disk of ngc 3314b , avoiding its dust lanes , so the color comparison among interlane regions would be more accurate .",
    "foreground intensity corrections use measurements of the spiral features in ngc 3314a seen off the background disk , as close as possible to the position of the interlane regions we measure and interpolated along the arm pattern to account for their changing brightness with distance from the foreground nucleus .",
    "the interlane regions specifically excluded bright clusters in ngc 3314b , to avoid the possibility of bias toward unusually bright and blue regions , which means that we always require the regions to show background structure over areas more than @xmath29 in size .",
    "we track errors based on the fluctuations seen in the off - disk foreground regions and the amount of interpolation needed between these regions to estimate the foreground light at each interlane position .",
    "we measured mean values of @xmath46 count rate ratio in tailored polygonal regions for each , converted into color excess @xmath47 by comparison with the ratio from the outer unobscured disk on ngc 3314b .",
    "these results are listed , with computed galactocentric distances for each region r(fg ) and r(bg ) for foreground and background systems , in table 1 . here and in table 2 ,",
    "the regions are listed with coordinate offsets from the nucleus of ngc 3314a , which has a position in the gsc reference frame ( 2000 ) 10@xmath48 37@xmath49 12@xmath50.900 -27@xmath16 41@xmath51 01@xmath52.33 .",
    "since the orientations of the two disks are different , we could in principle solve simultaneously for a background color gradient and foreground reddening gradient .",
    "however , given the distribution of the interlane regions we could identify , projected radii in both disks are strongly coupled for the whole sample .",
    "they range from 1.74.1 kpc in the foreground disk and 2.55.5 kpc in the background system .",
    "however , since we expect a genuine color gradient in ngc 3314b to be monotonic , a limit on such a gradient can be set from the majority of @xmath53 values which form a systematic trend after rejecting the three highest values ( which do not occur among the three points at the smallest radii , as shown in fig .",
    "this suggests a gradient of @xmath54 mag @xmath9 , reddening inwards , corresponding to about @xmath55 over @xmath41 .",
    "this places ngc 3314b among the spirals of similar hubble type with the flattest disk color behavior .",
    "we can use this estimate ( formally an upper limit ) of the background color gradient to interpret the color data in the interarm regions , which is important not only for the interlane extinction itself but as a zero level for the differential extinction in the prominent dust lanes .",
    "a rough fit to the run of @xmath53 versus projected radius in ngc 3314a ( fig .",
    "7 ) gives a slope of 0.12 mag kpc@xmath9 , flattening to essentially zero for radii greater than 4 kpc .",
    "since this color behavior is strongly affected by how we interpret the outer interlane region at 3.8 kpc , we can estimate a mean extinction from the h i column density reported by mcmahon et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which is about @xmath56 cm@xmath43 at these location at a resolution of @xmath58 \" delivered by their hybrid vla configuration . a typical galactic ratio of extinction to h i column density would predict a value @xmath59 from this average , consistent with out extrapolation .",
    "there is substantial scatter in the radial color behavior , much of which is surely driven by the errors in assessing the correction for foreground light in each region as well as genuine scatter among various parts of the disk . since the dust in the strong lanes has a reddening curve close to the milky way mean , we will not err much in assigning a similar slope @xmath60 to the milder interarm extinction .",
    "for extinctions small enough to keep the effective filter wavelengths constant , this means @xmath61 , giving an interarm extinction behavior over the range @xmath62 kpc rising by @xmath63 mag kpc@xmath9 going inward , starting from zero outside of @xmath64 kpc .",
    "this is in reasonable accord with the ground - based results of wkc , and for this first time lets us evaluate interlane dust in a more flocculent spiral system than could be analyzed before .      for dust lanes",
    "@xmath65 kpc or more from the center of ngc 3314a , the effects of interlane extinction and foreground structure are small enough that we can measure extinction in the dust lanes differentially with respect to their surroundings .",
    "this was done for nine discrete dust features surrounded by interlane regions , as identified in fig . 6 and listed in table 2 .",
    "we construct local models of the background light by interpolation along the pitch angle of the background spiral structure , and divide the data by these models to get maps of transmitted intensity at each wavelength , b and i. this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "8 for a typical dust lane .",
    "we do this with two extreme values for correction to account for light from the foreground disk in the dust lanes - zero as a lower limit , and assuming that the diffuse bright regions of the same arms when seen off the background disk are representative .",
    "the latter is an upper limit , since the dust lanes are also seen against ngc 3314a s own light when not backlit , and we can not do a more targeted correction ( incorporating lane / interlane distinctions in the pure background ares , for example ) without to some extent presuming the answer , since there is not a clear way to make the same kind of distinctions in different illuminated dust regions .",
    "this largest correction in fact leads to unphysical results ( negative intensities over large areas ) for dust lanes found 1.71.8 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "histograms of the derived transmissions @xmath66 in b for these dust lanes are shown in fig .",
    "9 , superimposed over two - color transmission plots for individual pixels in @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in the zero - correction case .",
    "these point - by - point data are fitted to derive the slope @xmath67 of the extinction curve ( section 4 ) .",
    "we do not see a strong trend in arm / interarm extinction contrast with galactocentric radius manifested in these distributions .",
    "the uncorrected histograms in fig . 9 show no connection between extinction and position within the disk , while the maximally corrected ones are more opaque within 2 kpc .",
    "however , these lanes are the ones in which the foreground - light correction is large and uncertain , so it is not clear whether the arm / interarm contrast changes with radius .",
    "spiral arms can include dust clouds on 15-pc scales with optical depths up to @xmath68 at any radius within the disk .",
    "there are several dust patches far from the nucleus of ngc 3314a whose allegiance is not obvious from the broad - band images , but for which association with h@xmath0 emission at its redshift makes it clear that they are part of the foreground disk ( examples are circled features 1 , 7 , and 8 in fig .",
    "the fiber - array spectra show a remarkably number of detections of h@xmath0 and [ n ii ] emission from the background system all throughout the region behind ngc3314a . even at the modest resolution of our synthesized h@xmath0 maps",
    ", there is a local anticorrelation between foreground and background h@xmath0 intensity , directly showing the connection between dusty regions and star formation .",
    "furthermore , at a given radius , the foreground h@xmath0 intensity correlates with dust lanes in absorption , supporting the same point .",
    "we can use the intensity of h@xmath0 from the background system to obtain crude values for the area - weighted transmission of light in these areas .",
    "ryder & dopita ( 1994 ) found that , using azimuthally averaged surface - brightness measures , typical spirals have nearly the same surface - brightness slopes for h@xmath0 and the @xmath15 continuum .",
    "most of the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter is in the normalization of the two , rather than slope differences , so we can apply this by normalizing the ratio in the outer , unobscured parts of ngc 3314b .",
    "the different inclinations of the two galaxies mean that irregularities in the ratio ( fluctuations in h@xmath0 equivalent width with radius ) will have their effect damped by contributions from other regions at a range of radius in the background system but similar radii in the foreground disk . since the relation is derived for the mean h@xmath0 surface brightness in a disk annulus , bright structures will not in themselves introduce a bias .",
    "the mean slope of their relation is given by @xmath69 for surface brightnesses @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath15 disk light from ngc 3314b was modeled as an exponential disk , with slope taken from the regions which are seen free of significant obscuration ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "depending on how the elliptical measurement annuli are weighted , a range of scale lengths @xmath72 is found , which gives an intensity difference of a factor 1.6 if both laws are normalized from @xmath73 and extrapolated inward to the nucleus .",
    "the h@xmath0 deficit in each radial bin with respect to this model was estimated by generating synthetic disks matching the expected profiles based on the @xmath15 disk models , and dividing the observed h@xmath0 points by these models after convolving with a @xmath25 flat - topped filter to account for the fiber aperture size .",
    "then the resulting h@xmath0 point - by - point transmission estimates were transformed into a coordinate system in the plane of ngc 3314a and radially averaged .",
    "this averaging ignored points without detected h@xmath0 , a point which somewhat biases the results to areas of low extinction , though the h@xmath0 detections span the entire radial extent of ngc 3314a .",
    "these data may be thought of as mostly an interarm measurement , since the transmission measures are dominated by the clearest areas , although the filling factor of these areas enters as well .",
    "the derived transmission values at the wavelength of h@xmath0 are listed in table 3 , ranging from 0.7 in the outer disk to 0.2 in the inner few arcseconds . here , the errors are dominated by uncertainties in the background model , specifically the allowed range of @xmath15 surface brightness in the inner disk predicted by the allowed fits in the outer portions .",
    "this uncertainty dominates that from scatter in each annular averaging region and the scatter in the typical @xmath15-h@xmath0 relation from ryder & dopita .",
    "the background nucleus of ngc 3314b is detected at @xmath11 and @xmath15 ( the latter is particularly obvious in a color - composite display or @xmath38 color map ) .",
    "we estimate the extinction in this direction ( 400 pc from the nucleus of ngc 3314a in its disk plane ) by measuring the excess flux from the nucleus over its surroundings ( removing disk light from ngc 3314a ) and adopting typical @xmath2 colors for sb nuclei . in the @xmath15 image (",
    "expanded about the nucleus in fig .",
    "10 ) , transmitted light from the background nucleus can be seen between several discrete , filamentary dust lanes .",
    "tracing along these relatively transparent regions gives a surface brightness for transmitted light there .",
    "the extinction we derive is large enough to be significant even at @xmath11 , so we make the mild assumption that the long - wavelength reddening curve goes as @xmath74 so that @xmath75 and adopt a simple two - component model for the extinction .",
    "we assume that the `` transparent '' regions have constant extinction and that the arm regions are completely opaque , using the @xmath15 image to give the fractional areas of each kind within the seeing disk of the @xmath11 measurements at the nucleus of ngc 3314b",
    ". then the ratio of intensities at @xmath15 and @xmath11 can give the extinction for the `` transparent '' regions .",
    "the `` opaque '' regions allow less than one third of the transmission of the `` transparent '' ones , since the background nuclear light is not clearly detected through them .",
    "an extremely red , near point - source object appears through one of the deep dust lanes , at about the right position to be a central intensity spike at the exact nucleus of ngc 3314b . this contributes less than 10% of the @xmath15 light from the background nucleus ( which we operationally take as light within a radius of @xmath76 ) , and is unlikely to have such extreme colors as to seriously affect the @xmath11 flux and bias the color measurement .",
    "the @xmath2 colors of galaxy nuclei should be robust , since the color evolution of stellar populations is muted at these long wavelengths . using an old ( 15 gyr )",
    "burst model from the bruzual & charlot calculations and the effective wavelengths of the f814w and @xmath11 filters gives an unreddened color index @xmath77 . within a radius @xmath76 of the ngc 3314b nucleus , chosen to encompass the seeing disk of the @xmath11 image",
    ", we derive a color for transmitted background light of @xmath78 for a reddening @xmath79 and extinctions @xmath80 .",
    "the larger extinctions in the dust lanes crossing this region mean that light transmitted through them can be ignored , even at @xmath11 , at our levels of accuracy .",
    "our color could be in error at the 0.3 magnitude level due to the complex structure and very different resolutions of the two images .",
    "for reference , a typical galactic extinction curve with this @xmath15 extinction has @xmath81 , depending in any particular case on the filter shape and background spectrum , since the reddening function is so steep . in this case",
    ", extinction can not be ignored near the nucleus even at 2.2@xmath70 .",
    "we summarize the results in this section by transforming the various extinction measurements to inferred transmission at @xmath14 , taking a representative slope for the extinction curve as given by @xmath60 to transform data at other wavelengths .",
    "11 shows all these data in plots of @xmath14 transmission ( linear and logarithmic ) versus radius within the disk of ngc 3314a , including dust - lane and interlane measurements .",
    "this gives an extinction picture of the spiral free of model assumptions as to its own internal structure .",
    "more arm regions clearly exist inside of 1.8 kpc with extinctions at least as large , which we could not measure because of the lack of obvious interarm regions from which to derive background properties .",
    "the overall agreement between disparate techniques gives some confidence in the general form of this plot , though the scatter near the nucleus appears large in the logarithm ( since the transmission is small , but just how small depends on the spatial resolution and exact region sampled ) .",
    "the smaller h@xmath0 extinction near the nucleus may also reflect the 3@xmath52 aperture size of the h@xmath0 observations , which may smear out the structure within this distance from the center .",
    "as in keel & white ( 2001 ) , we examine the extinction curve by considering the relation between transmissions measured at @xmath14 and @xmath15 for sets of points , with each slope ( parameterized as is customary via @xmath82 ) giving a different curve in a family . the expected relation between transmissions in these passbands , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , was calculated by taking a model photon - rate spectrum for the background disk ( an old population with constant star - formation rate ) , folding this through the response functions of the filters and wfpc2 ccds , applying a reddening of known amount with each value of @xmath67 , and deriving the transmission values for each set of @xmath85 and @xmath67 .",
    "for each of the dust lanes in table 2 , we derive the best - fitting value of @xmath67 in a @xmath86 sense , with the typical error derived from scatter in the upper region of each dust lane s data .",
    "reference curves for the galactic mean @xmath60 are shown for each dust feature in fig .",
    "we also considered two `` control '' regions outside the obvious extent of ngc 3314a , to show the effect of background structures on derived extinctions after our interpolation procedure .",
    "the amount of interlane extinction , with respect to which the differential dust lane values are measured , will not affect the measured slope of the reddening law as long as there is not a systematic change in dust properties between arm and interarm regions , and any such change will have its effects muted since our estimates for interlane extinctions are much less than we see in the arm dust lanes .",
    "extinction curves with a variety of @xmath67 values ( @xmath87 ) were fit to the @xmath15 and @xmath14 transmission data for each region .",
    "errors for the individual pixel values were estimated by determining the standard deviation about the mean in a slice through the @xmath15 data for a narrow range of @xmath14 transmission around @xmath88 .",
    "these errors were used in subsequent @xmath86 fits to the distributions of @xmath15 versus @xmath14 , both with no correction and with maximal correction for foreground galaxy light ( as in section 3.2 ) .",
    "table 4 lists the best fit @xmath67 value for each region , as well as @xmath89 , the @xmath86 per degree of freedom . in almost all cases ,",
    "the errors are large enough , and the @xmath86 distribution among fitted @xmath67 values so shallow , that the full range of fitted @xmath67 values are consistent ( at the 90% confidence level ) with the minimum .",
    "however , it is interesting that the scatter in fitted values is less than this would suggest ; in the uncorrected instance , they satisfy @xmath90 and in the maximum - correction case , @xmath91 ( where the error in each case is the standard deviation of the individual regions , larger by a factor 2.2 - 3 than the standard deviation of the mean ) . three regions could not be fit in the maximum - correction data , as the scatter in @xmath14 transmission from low - s / n pixels produced enormous scatter in one axis for large @xmath15 transmissions . since the form of the reddening trajectory is tightly constrained and can not follow most kinds of scatter , the true errors may be smaller than quoted .",
    "nevertheless , the most we can state is that the reddening law in ngc 3314 is broadly consistent with the milky way slope , and that there is no strong trend in @xmath67 with radius in ngc 3314a .",
    "this kind of analysis is limited to regions more than about 2 kpc from the foreground nucleus .",
    "the combination of increasing extinction and brighter foreground structure means that background features rapidly cease to be identifiable inside this radius , although the h@xmath0 results in section 3.3 show that significant light is still transmitted in some areas .",
    "several large dust complexes in ngc 3314a are seen partially silhouetted by the disk of ngc 3314b , providing an opportunity to test for the signature of a thick dust lane .",
    "numerous dust features in edge - on spirals extend vertically beyond most of the disk stars ( e.g. , howk & savage 1999,2000 ) , and the relative @xmath92-heights of dust and stars are important in radiative - transfer models for galaxies .",
    "our basic test is to compare the colors of the dust lane when seen against the background galaxy with those when it is seen by transmitted light from within ngc 3314a itself .",
    "a physically thick dust layer will have nearly the same color whether backlit by its own galaxy or another as well , while a thin one will appear substantially less red when not backlit externally .",
    "the use of color behavior to distinguish the height of dust clouds from the plane ( and implicitly their thickness , as a population at any rate ) was considered by elmegreen ( 1980 ) , who presents calculations including @xmath38 change or various mixes of cloud height and extinction . to first order ,",
    "cloud height and thickness are degenerate in the observed color , especially for large opacity . in a simple model of well - mixed starlight and a geometrically thin dust layer ,",
    "the relative light deficit in a dust lane seen from the foreground galaxy by itself will be half that of the same dust seen against the background system as well , while the reddening will be twice as large for a given light deficit .",
    "since we deal with relative amounts of  missing \" light , a strictly local comparison independent of the amount of background intensity will suffice as long as we consider regions where the background intensity is much higher than the level of foreground light .",
    "we tested for dust height using the large set of dust clouds seen on and off the background disk including dust lane 4 from fig .",
    "6 and the features seen to its north against only the light from the foreground spiral arm . for spatially confined dust , we used a median - windowed version of the @xmath15 image ( specifically the result of dividing the image by a median - filtered image with a 5.0@xmath52 window ) to derive the relative intensity of light received at each point , and compared these values to the @xmath38 colors pixel by pixel .",
    "histograms of the relative @xmath15 intensity showed the backlit dust to have many pixels with values as low as 0.3 , while the non - backlit dust lanes have no values below 0.75 , as predicted for a thin dust lane .",
    "comparable covering fractions are reached at , for example , 0.4 for the backlit case and 0.65 for the non - backlit areas .",
    "similarly , the relative intensity - color slope is much steeper for the non - backlit lane , such that the changes in @xmath38 at transmission 0.75 are 0.08 and 0.20 magnitude for the backlit and non - backlit regions , respectively . at least in the regions amenable to this test",
    ", most of the dust must be well - concentrated to the disk midplane .",
    "we have used several techniques to measure the extinction in ngc 3314a , using the backlighting provided by ngc 3314b .",
    "such results should be more robust than those from modelling a galaxy s extinction of its own radiation , and certainly incorporate very different assumptions and sources of error .",
    "combining results from differential extinction measures in dust lanes , color excess in interlane regions , h@xmath0 surface brightness of transmitted disk light , and the @xmath2 color of light from the background nucleus , we see a consistent picture of dust extinction in this spiral . converted to @xmath39 for convenience , and not making a correction for disk inclination , the extinction is essentially zero outside 0.7 @xmath41 , except for isolated and well - defined dust clumps whose densest resolved regions reach @xmath93 . within this radius ,",
    "the interarm extinction rises by about @xmath94 per kpc , and interspersed dusty arms can include regions of high opacity @xmath95 . in the innermost few hundred pc ,",
    "even the most transparent regions between dust lanes show @xmath96 and there are dusty arms with @xmath97 .",
    "these values correspond to lines of sight all the way through the disk , and are thus at least twice the effective extinction toward any particular component of the galaxy as expressed in its own escaping light . for calculations such as probabilities of absorption of qso light ,",
    "a good approximation is that the transmission rises linearly with radius from the center , reaching unity at about 0.7@xmath41 in blue light .",
    "the dust in distinct arms shows a reddening behavior broadly consistent with galactic dust , perhaps to be expected for reasonably luminous spirals .",
    "fits by @xmath86 to two - color reddening trajectories give values for the @xmath67 parameter 2.95.1 , with a grand average from both data corrected for maximal foreground light and uncorrected of @xmath1 using the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "one spiral arm shows comparable dust complexes in both backlit and non - backlit regions .",
    "the color - intensity behavior in these regions suggests that the dust is more strongly concentrated to the disk plane than is the starlight , as found in the milky way and several external edge - on spirals .",
    "we are grateful for the efforts and cooperation of the hubble heritage team , especially lisa frattare , in generating a data set of considerable scientific as well as aesthetic value , partucularly in matching the pointing and orientation of the two data sets so precisely .",
