    "there has been a lot of recent interest in the chaotic dynamics of nonlinear systems that possess invariant subspaces ; a number of quite subtle dynamical effects come to light in examining the interaction of attractors with the invariant subspaces .",
    "moreover a good understanding of these effects is essential in interpreting and predicting dynamics of simulations and experiments where the presence of discrete spatial symmetries implies the existence of invariant subspaces .",
    "a fundamental bifurcation in such a setting is the blowout bifurcation where a chaotic attractor within an invariant subspace loses stability to perturbations transverse to the invariant subspace . in doing so , can either create a nearby ` branch ' of chaotic attractors or lose stability altogether .",
    "in contrast with this , the presence of invariant subspaces can lead to the existence of what have been called robust heteroclinic cycles between equilibria , that is , heteroclinic cycles that are persistent under small perturbations that preserve the symmetry .",
    "these cycles may or may not be attracting @xcite .",
    "recently it has been recognised that cycles to more complicated invariant sets can also occur robustly in symmetric systems , in particular to chaotic invariant sets ; this behaviour was named ` cycling chaos ' in a recent paper by dellnitz _",
    "_   and has been further investigated by field @xcite and ashwin @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we find there is a connection between these dynamical properties ; we show a scenario where a blowout bifurcation creates an attracting ` cycling chaotic ' state in a bifurcation that is analogous to a saddle - node homoclinic bifurcation with equilibria replaced by chaotic invariant sets .",
    "we also investigate how the attracting cycling chaotic state that is created in the blowout bifurcation loses stability at a resonance of liapunov exponents .",
    "( a _ resonance bifurcation _ in its simplest form occurs when a homoclinic cycle to an equilibrium loses attractiveness ; this occurs when the real parts of eigenvalues of the linearisation become equal in magnitude . ) in spite of the system being neither a skew product nor being a homoclinic cycle to a chaotic set as in @xcite we see similar behaviour and can predict the loss of stability by looking at a rational combination of liapunov exponents .",
    "we find this scenario of a blowout bifurcation to cycling chaos is a mechanism for transition from stable two - dimensional to fully three - dimensional magnetoconvection .",
    "the model we study is a galerkin truncation for magnetoconvection in a region with square plan , subject to periodic boundary conditions on vertical boundaries and idealised boundary conditions on horizontal boundaries .",
    "phenomenologically speaking we see a change from a chaotically varying two - dimensional flow ( with trivial dependence on the third coordinate , and which comes arbitrarily close to a trivial conduction state ) to an attracting state where trajectories spend increasingly long times near one of two symmetrically related two - dimensional flows interspersed with short transients .",
    "we explain and investigate this transition in terms of a blowout bifurcation of a chaotic attractor in an invariant subspace .    in the paper of ott and sommerer that coined the phrase ` blowout bifurcation ' ,",
    "two scenarios are identified .",
    "either the blowout was _ supercritical _ in which case it leads to an _ on - off intermittent _ state , or it is _ subcritical _ and there is no nearby attractor after the bifurcation .",
    "we find an additional robust possibility for bifurcation at blowout .    near this transition",
    "the three - dimensional flow patterns show characteristics of intermittent cycling between two symmetrically related ` laminar ' states corresponding to two - dimensional flows , but the time spent near the laminar state is , on average , infinite .",
    "this suggests that the blowout is supercritical , but in a weaker sense which we make precise .",
    "namely , we say a blowout is _ set supercritical _",
    "if there is a branch of chaotic attractors after the blowout whose limit contains the attractor in the invariant subspaces before the blowout .",
    "in particular there may be other invariant sets contained in this limit and so any natural measures on the bifurcating branch of attractors ( if they exist ) need not limit to the natural measure of the system on the invariant subspace .",
    "we also show that the attractors corresponding to two - dimensional flows are not liapunov stable , but are milnor attractors near the transition to three dimensions , and so in particular we expect the presence of noise to destabilise two - dimensional attractors near blowout by a _ bubbling _ type of mechanism @xcite .",
    "we find in our example that the state of cycling chaos is attracting once it has been created : trajectories cycle between neighbourhoods of the chaotic sets within the invariant subspaces , and the time between switches from one neighbourhood to the next increases geometrically as trajectories get closer and closer to the invariant subspaces . by estimating the rate of increase of switching times , we are able to show that cycling chaos ceases to be attracting in a resonance bifurcation .",
    "one remarkable aspect of this study is that we are able to predict the parameter values at which the blowout bifurcation and the resonance occur , requiring only a single numerical average over the chaotic set within the invariant subspace .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ secmodel ] we introduce the ode model for magnetoconvection , discuss its symmetries and corresponding invariant subspaces .",
    "this is followed by a description of the creation , persistence and loss of stability of the cycling chaos on varying a parameter in numerical simulations in section  [ secnumerics ] .",
    "section  [ secmap ] shows how one can , under certain assumptions , derive a map model of the dynamics of the ode that has the same dynamical behaviour . section  [ secblowout ] is a theoretical analysis of the blowout bifurcation that creates the cycling chaotic attractor and is followed in section  [ secresonance ] by a theoretical analysis of its loss of stability .",
    "finally , section  [ secdiscuss ] discusses some of the implications of this work on the chaotic dynamics of symmetric systems .",
    "the model we study is an ode on @xmath1 described by the following equations @xmath2 these odes have been derived as an asymptotic limit of a model of three - dimensional incompressible convection in a plane layer , with an imposed vertical magnetic field ; for further details and details of its derivation , see @xcite . in the context of this model , @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the amplitudes of convective rolls with their axes aligned in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( horizontal ) directions respectively , @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent modes that cause the rolls to tilt , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent shear across the layer in the @xmath6 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "the modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the horizontal component of the magnetic field in the @xmath6 and @xmath5 directions , and @xmath13 represents the horizontally averaged temperature .",
    "the model has are five primary parameters : @xmath14  is proportional to the imposed temperature difference across the layer , with @xmath15 at the initial bifurcation to convection ; @xmath16  is related to the horizontal spatial periodicity length , but is an arbitrary small parameter in the model of @xcite ; @xmath17  and @xmath18 are dimensionless viscous and magnetic diffusion coefficients ; and @xmath19  is proportional to the square of the imposed magnetic field .",

    "[ figphaseportraits ] we show a typical example of timeseries when there is attracting cycling chaos ( with @xmath60 ) .",
    "the system starts with @xmath3 oscillating chaotically while @xmath4 is quiescent , switches to a state where @xmath4 oscillates chaotically while @xmath3 is quiescent , and so on .",
    "a more careful examination reveals that after a switch the trajectory remains close to a fixed point in @xmath42 or @xmath43 for an increasing length of time .",
    "physically , this corresponds to chaotic two - dimensional convection that switches between rolls aligned in the @xmath6 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "figure  [ figphaseportraits](c ) shows the chaotic trajectories projected onto the @xmath61 plane , while ( d ) illustrates switching between @xmath39 ( the ` horizontal ' plane ) and @xmath40 ( the ` vertical ' plane ) .",
    "note how the chaotic behaviour in figure  [ figphaseportraits](a ) and ( b ) repeats : trajectories spend longer and longer near the unstable manifolds of the @xmath6-roll and @xmath5-roll equilibrium points and take longer and longer between each switch .",
    "this is illustrated further in figure  [ figslowingdown ] , which shows intersections of a trajectory with the poincar surface @xmath62 close to the trivial solution .",
    "there are two phases evident in the cycle : the order one chaotic behaviour of @xmath3 near @xmath39 ( while @xmath4 grows exponentially ) , and the exponential growth of @xmath63 as the trajectory moves away from @xmath40 ( while @xmath4 behaves chaotically ) .",
    "the time between switches increases monotonically and the rate of increase varies with  @xmath16 , the normal parameter . in these numerical simulations ,",
    "the switching time saturates when certain components of the solution come close to the machine accuracy of the computations ( about @xmath64 for double precision ) .",
    "we argue that this is evidence for attracting cycling chaos : trajectories approach a structurally stable heteroclinic cycle between chaotic sets . in figure",
    "[ figcycle ] we show a schematic picture of the heteroclinic cycle .",
    "we recall that the fixed point spaces @xmath42 and @xmath43 are 2 dimensional , @xmath41 is 3 dimensional , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are 5 dimensional and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are 6 dimensional invariant subspaces in the 9 dimensional phase space .",
    "the system starts near the @xmath6-roll equilibrium point in  @xmath42 , which is unstable to shear ( @xmath9 ) ; the parameters are such that the unstable manifold of @xmath6-rolls comes close to the trivial solution and returns to a neighbourhood of @xmath6-rolls .",
    "this global near - connection within @xmath39 is the source of the chaotic behaviour .",
    "we refer to the chaotic sets in @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively ; these contain the relevant roll equilibrium points and they both contain the trivial solution , so there are structurally stable connections from the trivial solution to the roll equilibrium points and from those to @xmath65 and @xmath66 . within @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath65  is unstable to cross - rolls ( @xmath4 ) since the trivial solution is equally unstable in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions .",
    "eventually @xmath4 grows large enough that there is a switch to the @xmath5-roll equilibrium point in  @xmath43 , at which point @xmath10 starts to grow .",
    "thus the cycle connects invariant sets in the following fixed point subspaces : @xmath67 between the equilibrium points in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 within @xmath39 and  @xmath40 , with the structurally stable connections needed to complete the cycle from @xmath65 and @xmath66 to the @xmath5-roll and @xmath6-roll equilibrium points lying within @xmath37 and  @xmath38 .",
    "note that our scenario is certainly a simplification of the full set of heteroclinic connections ; there are other fixed points contained in the closure of the smallest attracting invariant set , in particular the origin is contained within the cycle .",
    "we turn now to the question of how the cycling chaos is created . with @xmath68",
    "we find attracting two - dimensional chaos ( figure  [ figblowout]a ,  b ) , which loses stability around @xmath69  ( c ) in a blowout bifurcation , and for @xmath70  ( d ) , there is exponential growth away from  @xmath39 into  @xmath37 . within @xmath37 ,",
    "the @xmath5-roll equilibrium points are sinks , establishing the structurally stable connection from the chaos in @xmath39 to the equilibrium point in  @xmath43 , and hence the creation of cycling chaos .      as illustrated in figures  [ figslowingdown ] , as @xmath16 decreases towards  @xmath71",
    ", trajectories spend progressively longer in each visit to @xmath39 and @xmath40 before switching to the conjugate chaotic invariant set . eventually , trajectories come arbitrarily close to the invariant subspaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( limited only by machine accuracy in the numerical simulations )",
    ". figure  [ figresonance ] shows how the time intervals between switches between @xmath65 and @xmath66 increases as the system approaches this heteroclinic cycle , and how the rate of approach to the heteroclinic cycle decreases as @xmath16 approaches  @xmath72 .",
    "the intervals between switches grow by a factor of about @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 per switch for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath71 . by @xmath82 ,",
    "the heteroclinic cycle is no longer attracting , and for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the system settles down to periodic behaviour that is bounded away from @xmath39 and @xmath40 , though the periodic orbits are actually quite close to these invariant subspaces . for these calculations , we imposed a cut - off of  @xmath85 : the calculation ceased once any variable became smaller than this .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive a map that allows us to compute longer trajectories more accurately , and we demonstrate cycling chaos , its creation in a blowout bifurcation and its loss of attractiveness using this map .",
    "we analyse the blowout bifurcation in section  [ secblowout ] , and argue in section  [ secresonance ] that the cycling chaos created in that bifurcation ceases to be attractive at a resonance .",
    "in this section , we discuss a map that models the behaviour of the odes in the parameter regime described above , and that helps clarify what happens near blowout bifurcation and the resonance of the cycling chaos .",
    "we rely on a map derived for the two - dimensional dynamics by breaking up the flow into pieces near and between equilibrium points  @xcite . within the @xmath39 subspace , the leading stable eigendirection of the origin ( that is , the eigendirection with negative eigenvalue closest to zero ) is in the @xmath86 plane , and the unstable direction of the origin is along the @xmath3  axis .",
    "all trajectories leaving the origin in that direction follow the structurally stable connection within @xmath42 to one or other of the @xmath6-roll equilibrium points .",
    "the one - dimensional unstable manifold of @xmath6-rolls lies within @xmath39 , and the chaotic attractor is associated with a global bifurcation at which that unstable manifold collides with the origin . near this global bifurcation ,",
    "the dynamics within @xmath39 is modelled by an augmented lorenz map : @xmath87 defined as a map from the surface of section @xmath88 to itself .",
    "details of the derivation are given in  @xcite , but briefly , @xmath32 is a parameter related to @xmath14 in the odes , with @xmath89 at the global bifurcation ; @xmath90  is a small positive constant that we scale to one ; @xmath91 if @xmath92 and @xmath93 if @xmath94 ; @xmath95 depends on the ratio of various stable and unstable eigenvalues at the origin and the @xmath6-roll equilibrium points ( with @xmath96 ) ; and @xmath97 is a ( negative ) constant .",
    "it is a straightforward matter to include the effect of a small perturbation in the @xmath4 and @xmath10 directions . near the @xmath39 subspace , @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath10 will grow linearly at a rate that depends on  @xmath3 .",
    "this means that we get a mapping of the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are constants and the exponents @xmath101 and @xmath102 again depend on ratios of eigenvalues , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the exponent @xmath101 is negative since a small value of @xmath3 implies that the trajectory spends longer near the origin , so @xmath4 has a longer time to grow .",
    "similarly , near  @xmath40 we get the mapping @xmath105 as long as @xmath3 is much smaller than  @xmath4 .",
    "these maps are valid provided that the trajectory remains close to the @xmath39 or @xmath40 subspaces .",
    "we model the switch from behaviour near @xmath39 to near @xmath40 by assuming that ( [ eqnearpx ] ) holds provided that @xmath106 ; otherwise , the trajectory leaves the neighbourhood of the origin along the @xmath4-axis , visits a @xmath5-roll equilibrium point and returns to the surface of section @xmath107 near the origin : @xmath108 where , as above , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are constants and @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are ratios of eigenvalues .",

    "cycling chaos is found after the blowout bifurcation ( figure  [ figmaptwo]a ) : the system switches between chaos in @xmath39 and chaos in @xmath40 , getting closer and closer to the invariant subspaces after each switch and spending longer between switches ( figure  [ figmaptwo]b ) .",
    "the rate of increase of the intervals between switches depends on  @xmath16 , and is about a factor of 1.01 per switch for @xmath134 . decreasing  @xmath16 to @xmath135 ( figure  [ figmaptwo]c , d ) results in growth away from cycling chaos and saturation to a periodic orbit .    these calculations required formulating the map ( [ eqnearpx][eqswitchpypx ] ) in terms of the logarithms of the variables in order to cope with the large ( @xmath136 ) dynamic range .",

    "minimal milnor attractor _ if there are no proper compact invariant subsets @xmath147 with @xmath148 @xcite .    as shown in , milnor attractors can occur in a robust manner if the attractor lies within an invariant subspace .",

    "it is possible to show ( under certain additional hypotheses ) that @xmath138 as an attractor in the full system if and only if @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the most positive liapunov exponent for @xmath14 in a direction transverse to @xmath149 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . if we have access to a normal parameter @xcite such that we can vary the normal dynamics without changing the dynamics in  @xmath149 , we can vary @xmath151 through zero and observe loss of attractiveness of @xmath138 at what ott and sommerer have termed a _ blowout bifurcation _ .",
    "ott and sommerer identify two possible scenarios at blowout . at a _ supercritical blowout _ the attractor bifurcates to a family of attractors displaying on - off intermittency , with trajectories that come arbitrarily close to @xmath138 and",
    "thus linger near @xmath138 for long times ( but with a well - defined mean length of lingering or ` laminar phase ' ) . at _ subcritical blowout _ there are no nearby attractors after loss of stability of @xmath138 .",
    "note that @xcite discusses the question of how to distinguish these cases .",
    "however , what we see in this paper is that there is at least one other possibility at blowout bifurcation that is also robust to normal perturbations , namely a bifurcation to a cycling state or a robust heteroclinic cycle between chaotic invariant sets .",
    "this can be seen to be set supercritical but not supercritical , in the following sense .    by reparametrising",
    "if necessary we can assume that we have a normal parameter @xmath152 so @xmath138 undergoes a blowout bifurcation at @xmath153 . by the argument above , @xmath138 is an attractor only if @xmath154 .",
    "if there is a family of minimal milnor attractors @xmath155 , @xmath156 such that for all @xmath157 @xmath158 then we say that the blowout is _",
    "set supercritical_. note that as discussed in and implied by the very word ` blowout ' , we can not typically expect the limit of the attractors to just be the set @xmath138 .",
    "if in addition @xmath155 supports a family of natural ergodic invariant measures @xmath159 ( @xmath156 ) and @xmath160 as @xmath161 then we say the blowout is _ measure supercritical _ or just _ supercritical_. ( convergence is the in the @xmath162 topology on probability measures . )",
    "this definition of criticality was used in @xcite .",
    "if the blowout is not set supercritical then we say the blowout is _",
    "subcritical_.    it seems that one will often get bifurcations in symmetric systems that are set supercritical but not supercritical .",
    "for example one can generically get a blowout from a group orbit of attractors ( under a finite group ) which yields a single attractor that limits onto the whole group orbit .",
    "moreover , in the cycling chaos studied here , the attractor after blowout includes not only the chaotic invariant sets , but also fixed points involved in the heteroclinic cycle . as it is a cycle",
    ", it does not possess a natural ergodic invariant measure @xcite and averages of observables from the system in this state will typically not converge but continue to oscillate more and more slowly .    the blowout scenario described above holds only for variation of normal parameters",
    "; in general the variation of a parameter will affect both the normal dynamics and the dynamics within the invariant subspace .",
    "if the dynamics in the invariant subspace is chaotic , we can expect to see a large number of bifurcations happening within the invariant subspace and these will cause the blowout to be spread over an interval of parameter values ; there is no reason why @xmath163 should vary continuously with a parameter that varies @xmath164 in a very discontinuous manner .",
    "nevertheless , for the numerical results presented in section  [ secnumerics ] the dynamics in the invariant subspace vary in quite regular way .",
    "this is because in our system the parameter @xmath16 is a normal parameter for the attractor @xmath65 ; for more discussion of normal parameters , see .      by mechanisms described in @xcite the pure @xmath6 and @xmath5 chaotic dynamics corresponding to dynamics within @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "respectively can become chaotic by means of a symmetric global bifurcation that generates lorenz - like attractors approaching the equilibrium solution with full symmetry and @xmath6-roll or @xmath5-roll equilibrium solutions in @xmath42 or  @xmath43 .",
    "now suppose there exist chaotic attractors @xmath65 and @xmath66 contained in @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( on average they have more symmetry ) , from here on we will mostly discuss @xmath65 but note that as @xmath66 is a conjugate attractor , the same will hold for  @xmath66 .",
    "these attractors contain a saddle equilibrium @xmath165 in @xmath46 ( the trivial solution ) and so in particular they can not be liapunov stable attractors .",
    "this is because @xmath166 must be non - trivial manifold ( otherwise @xmath165 is an attractor ; thus @xmath167 is also non - trivial as @xmath168 is conjugate to @xmath169 .",
    "therefore @xmath170 and so @xmath65 can not be liapunov stable .",
    "however it is possible that @xmath65 is an attractor in the sense of milnor ; this will imply that the basin will be locally riddled in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are minimal milnor attractors containing @xmath165 .",
    "we also assume that they have natural ergodic invariant measures @xmath164 and @xmath171 supported on them .",
    "we now concentrate on @xmath65 . whether @xmath65 is an attractor depends on its the spectrum of normal liapunov exponents .",
    "note that the zero liapunov exponent corresponding to time translation always corresponds to a perturbation tangential to the invariant subspace .",
    "if @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the most positive normal liapunov exponent for the measure  @xmath14 , it is possible to show that @xmath65 satisfies  ( [ eqmattr ] ) @xcite , and hence that @xmath65 is a milnor attractor .",
    "it is comparatively easy to compute @xmath163 in that case , as the largest transverse liapunov exponent of @xmath65 in the parameter regime discussed corresponds to directions in the @xmath37 direction , where linearised perturbations are described by @xmath174 thus we can see that @xmath175 where @xmath176 . from the equation for @xmath177 it is possible to show that @xmath178 along bounded trajectories of the ode . for the given parameter values it is possible to approximate @xmath179 and so @xmath180 .",
    "thus @xmath181 implying that the blowout bifurcation occurs at approximately @xmath69 , which is in good agreement with the simulations ( figure  [ figblowout]b ) .",
    "note that whenever @xmath165 is hyperbolic and within the attractor @xmath65 there exists at least one ergodic invariant measure @xmath182 ( in particular that one supported on  @xmath165 ) such that @xmath183 .",
    "in particular , this means that the basins of the attractors @xmath65 and @xmath66 are riddled for all parameter values in our problem !    likewise ,",
    "in the map  ( [ eqnearpx ] ) near  @xmath39 , the logarithm of  @xmath4 obeys @xmath184 where @xmath101 is a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the most positive normal liapunov exponent in this case is then @xmath185 where the average is taken over the lorenz attractor . averaging over @xmath186 iterates of  ( [ eqlorenz ] ) yields @xmath187 and , solving ( [ eqlambdae ] ) for @xmath16",
    ", we obtain @xmath188 at the blowout bifurcation , in agreement with the data in figure  [ figmapone](b ) .",
    "as @xmath163 passes through @xmath189 , @xmath65 loses stability and becomes a chaotic saddle , and in doing so it creates a continuum of connections from @xmath65 to the fixed point ( @xmath5-rolls ) in @xmath43 .",
    "these connections are robust to @xmath34-equivariant perturbations , as @xmath5-rolls are sinks within @xmath37 , and so there is a robust cycle alternating between the equilibrium points in @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the chaotic sets in @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we observed in sections  [ secnumerics ] and [ secmap ] that this cycling chaos is attractive once it is created ; we turn to the stability of cycling chaos in the next section .",
    "it is clear from figures  [ figslowingdown ] , [ figresonance ] and [ figmaptwo ] that the key to understanding the loss of stability of cycling chaos lies in obtaining the rate at which trajectories approach that state .",
    "it is possible to estimate this rate for the map , and we use information gained in this calculation to carry out the same estimate in the odes , and thus are able to obtain the values of  @xmath16 at which the loss of stability occurs , in the map and in the odes .",
    "what is remarkable is that , once a single average over  @xmath65 has been computed numerically , the value of @xmath16 at the bifurcation point can be obtained analytically .",
    "we suppose that ( in the map ) the system arrives near  @xmath39 with given values of @xmath190 , iterates using  ( [ eqnearpx ] ) @xmath191  times ( @xmath192 ) , ending up in a state @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "there follows one iterate of  ( [ eqswitchpxpy ] ) , leaving the system near  @xmath40 in a state @xmath195 ( we are ignoring changes of sign of the variables ) .",
    "we need to establish an estimate of @xmath196 , a measure of the distance from  @xmath40 , given that @xmath197 were small when the system started close to  @xmath39 .",
    "properly , the value of @xmath198 after @xmath191 iterates will depend on the values of @xmath3 over those @xmath191 iterates , but if @xmath191 is large , we approximate the detailed history of @xmath3 by its average and obtain @xmath199 where @xmath200 are liapunov exponents in the expanding and contracting directions around  @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath201  is precisely the liapunov exponent that went through zero at the blowout bifurcation in  ( [ eqlambdae ] ) .",
    "note that we have effectively approximated the chaotic set @xmath65 by an equilibrium point .",
    "the trajectory escapes from the neighbourhood of @xmath39 once @xmath194 ; since @xmath3 is typically of order one ( compared to the tiny initial value of  @xmath4 ) , we assume that the escape takes place when @xmath202 , so obtaining @xmath203 with @xmath204 and @xmath198 both of order one",
    ".    one iterate of  ( [ eqswitchpxpy ] ) now yields @xmath205 these expressions will be dominated by @xmath206 once the trajectory is very close to the heteroclinic cycle , so , neglecting terms of order one , we obtain @xmath207   \\left(\\matrix{\\log|y_0|\\cr                 \\log|y_2|\\cr}\\right ) + { \\cal o}(1)\\ ] ] for large negative values of @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "a conjugate map will describe the return from @xmath40 to @xmath39 .",
    "one eigenvalue of the matrix is zero because of the way we approximated the behaviour near the chaotic set ; the other eigenvalue is @xmath210 which we refer to as the _ stability index_.",
    "the zero eigenvalue forces @xmath211 , so after one iterate of the composite map  ( [ eqlinearisedmap ] ) , the dynamics will obey @xmath212 clearly if @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath208 will tend to @xmath215 and the trajectory will asymptote to attracting cycling chaos .",
    "conversely , if @xmath216 , cycling chaos is unstable and trajectories will leave the domain of validity of the approximations we have made .",
    "we can also deduce from  ( [ eqnumberits ] ) that the number of iterates between each switch will increase by a factor of  @xmath30 per switch .    at the point at which cycling chaos is created ( as @xmath201 increases through zero )",
    ", we see that @xmath30 is much greater than one , provided that @xmath217 is negative and @xmath112 is positive , both of which are true in the examples we have discussed .",
    "we deduce that cycling chaos is attracting near to its creation at the blowout bifurcation .      from the condition that @xmath218 at the loss of stability of the chaotic cycle , we determine that this bifurcation occurs in the map at @xmath219 , in agreement with the data in figure  [ figmaptwo ] .",
    "returning to the odes , we observe that in ( [ eqrhomap ] ) @xmath112 and @xmath113 are ratios of eigenvalues of @xmath6-rolls ( proportional to decay rates of @xmath4 and  @xmath10 ) , while @xmath201 and @xmath217 are the growth rate of @xmath4 and the decay rate of @xmath10 near the chaotic set  @xmath65 . in the odes , the linearisation of  ( [ eqode ] ) about  @xmath65 yields @xmath119 for the decay rate of  @xmath10 , while the growth rate of  @xmath4 is given by  ( [ eqlambdae ] ) .",
    "hence we have the stability index @xmath220 for the odes , where @xmath201 is given by  ( [ eqlambdae ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath112 and @xmath201 are both functions of  @xmath16 .",
    "the condition @xmath218 is readily solved for @xmath16 , and has solution @xmath221 . at @xmath221 the odes are still approaching cycling chaos , with switching times increasing by a factor of above 1.02 per switch ( see figure  [ figresonance ] ) .",
    "however , the odes have not yet reached their asymptotic rate of slowing down , resolving this small discrepancy .    on decreasing @xmath16 below @xmath71 , the stability index  @xmath30 increases above unity and the cycling chaos will no longer be attracting .",
    "this loss of stability can broadly be classed as a resonance of liapunov exponents .",
    "observe that the resonance will be located at different @xmath16 for different invariant measures supported on @xmath222 and so we expect the presence of riddling and associated phenomena found in @xcite at a resonance of a simpler model displaying cycling chaos .",
    "we observe that for @xmath16 below the resonance bifurcation , the system exhibits behaviour that is numerically indistinguishable from periodic : there appear to be a large number of coexisting apparently periodic orbits .",
    "we hypothesize that the resonance creates a branch of ` approximately periodic attractors ' , i.e. , attractors that have a well - defined finite mean period of passage around the cycle , going to infinity at the resonance @xcite .",
    "these might lock onto long periodic orbits for progressively smaller @xmath16 , as found in the numerical simulations .",
    "for this example , the approximately periodic attractor branches set supercritically from the cycling chaos ; however one presumes that subcritical branching is also possible .",
    "research is presently in progress on understanding the more detailed branching behaviour at this bifurcation .",
    "this study has shown that one possible , apparently generic scenario for loss of stability of a chaotic attractor in an invariant subspace on varying a normal parameter is as follows : there is a blowout bifurcation that creates an attracting , robust heteroclinic cycle between chaotic invariant sets ( cycling chaos ) .",
    "the bifurcation is set supercritical but not supercritical , i.e. , the bifurcated attractors contain the attractor for the system in the invariant subspace , but unlike in a supercritical bifurcation ( to an on - off intermittent state ) the length of laminar phases increases unboundedly along a single trajectory even at a finite distance from the blowout .",
    "this cycling chaotic state can be modelled well by the network shown in figure  [ figcycle ] although in reality the network is complicated by the facts that ( a ) there are other fixed points contained in the closure of unstable manifolds and ( b ) the fixed points in @xmath223 and @xmath224 are actually contained in the chaotic sets @xmath65 and @xmath66 rather than being isolated .",
    "we suspect this may have the consequence that there is no poincar section to the flow and so the cycle is ` dirty ' in the terminology of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the normal liapunov spectrum of the invariant chaotic set seems to determine the attraction or not of the cycle .",
    "the attracting cycling chaos is observed to lose stability via a mechanism that resembles a resonance of eigenvalues in an orbit heteroclinic to equilibria .",
    "such a resonance has been seen to occur in special classes of systems with skew product structure @xcite , in analogy to the branching of periodic orbits at a homoclinic resonance investigated by .    throughout this investigation",
    ", it has been necessary to monitor carefully several numerical effects . in particular , for trajectories that display asymptotic slowing down characteristic of cycling chaos there will be a point at which rounding errors cause the dynamics either to transfer to the invariant subspace , or keep the dynamics a finite distance from the invariant subspace . in the context of physical systems",
    "there will always be imperfections in the system and noise that will destroy the invariant subspaces .",
    "nevertheless the perfect symmetry model will be very useful in describing what one expects to see in such imperfect situations .    it still remains to prove",
    "rigorously that the observed scenario is generic and so of interest to other , less specific models and in particular pde models of which this is a truncation .",
    "we could like to emphasise that the behaviour we see occurs for a reasonably large region of physically relevant parameters in the ode model and moreover we are unaware of any other classification which explains and predicts the observed dynamics to the degree that we have done here . in principal cycling chaos can be seen in ode models down to dimension 4 , though not smaller than this ; thus this dynamics should be seen as something that will not be created at a generic bifurcation from a trivial state , but rather in a more complicated dynamical regime far from primary bifurcation .",
    "we have discussed a possible route to cycling chaos through a blowout bifurcation , and how cycling chaos might cease to be attracting , both in general terms and in the context of a specific model .",
    "our general results ought to be applicable to a variety of other problems .",
    "in particular , behaviour that might be understood in terms of cycling chaos has been seen by knobloch _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in an ode model of the dipole  quadrupole interaction in the solar dynamo . in their model",
    ", there is a weakly broken symmetry between the dipole and quadrupole subspaces , and the system switches between the two subspaces , favouring one over the other since they are not equivalent .",
    "finally , one comment that deserves to be made is that the choice of @xmath16 as the parameter allows an important simplification because of this parameter is normal for dynamics within @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "one assumes that similar behaviour will be observed for non - normal parameters with the exception that the chaos in the invariant subspace will be fragile and destroyed by many arbitrarily small perturbations ; see .",
    "we acknowledge very interesting conversations with mike field , marty golubitsky and edgar knobloch concerning this work .",
