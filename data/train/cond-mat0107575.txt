    "<S> the accuracy of the most popular reflectance technique is limited by the reference problem ( the absolute value of the reflectivity , r , is required ) and by the need of a kramers - kronig analysis which involves extrapolation of r towards zero and infinite frequency . </S>",
    "<S> both problems become particularly important if r is close to unity such as for the fir in - plane response of htsc . in this manuscript we present experimental data of the in - plane dielectric response of a detwinned yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal which have been obtained by spectral ellipsometry . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has the advantage that it is self - normalizing and allows one to measure directly the complex dielectric function , @xmath4=@xmath5+i@xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the in - plane dielectric response contains a surprisingly large number of collective modes , some of which posses an unusually large spectral weight ( sw ) and exhibit pronounced anomalies at the sc transition . </S>",
    "<S> these modes thus seem to involve collective excitations of the charge carriers and of the sc condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the observed in - plane anisotropy of the electronic background and the collective modes can not be consistently explained in terms of a superposition of independent contributions from cuo@xmath0 planes and 1-d metallic cuo chains . </S>",
    "<S> our results rather suggest that the 1-d cuo chains enhance ( or possibly even induce ) a charge density modulation within the 2-d cuo@xmath0 planes .    </S>",
    "<S> the ellipsometric measurements were performed at the u4ir and u10a beamlines of the national synchrotron light source ( nsls ) in brookhaven , usa . we used a homebuilt setup attached to a conventional fourier spectrometer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high brilliance of the synchrotron allows us to study small crystals in grazing incidence geometry ( @xmath7=85@xmath8{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion \\pm 1% % tcimacro{\\unicode[m]{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] ) which is required for metallic samples with a brewster - angle close to 90@xmath8{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] @xcite . since the dielectric response of htsc is strongly anisotropic we performed measurements for different configurations of the principal axis ( a , b , and c ) with respect to the plane of incidence of the light . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor components of @xmath4 have then been obtained by standard numerical procedures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously shown by measurements on gold films that a meaningful determination of @xmath9 for millimeter size metallic samples requires to take diffraction effects into account @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of us ( j.h . ) has studied these effects theoretically for a sample with infinite conductivity and has developed an inversion procedure @xcite which we have successfully applied to data on small gold films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same procedure was used for the present data .    a y-123 single crystal of size 2.8@xmath104@xmath100.6 mm@xmath11 ( a@xmath10b@xmath10c ) was flux - grown in an y - stabilized zro@xmath0 crucible . </S>",
    "<S> it was annealed for one week in flowing oxygen at 420 @xmath8{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] c resulting in t@xmath3=91.5(@xmath120.8 ) k as determined by dc - squid magnetometry . </S>",
    "<S> one ab- and one ac - face were polished to optical grade before the crystal was mechanically detwinned as confirmed by inspection under a polarizing optical microscope . </S>",
    "<S> micro - raman measurements confirm the detwinning and the high quality of the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they also reveal a strong sc induced anomaly of the b@xmath13 mode at 340 @xmath14 which is characteristic for slightly overdoped y-123 @xcite .    figures 1(i ) and 1(ii ) display the real part of the a - axis optical conductivity , @xmath15(@xmath16 ) , and of the dielectric function , @xmath17(@xmath16 ) at 100 and 10 k ( thin and thick solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the broad electronic features are similar to those reported for reflectivity data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ns the conductivity consists of a drude - like peak at low frequencies that merges with a broad mir - band which extends beyond the displayed range . in the sc state </S>",
    "<S> a pronounced dip appears in @xmath15(@xmath16 ) with an onset around 950 @xmath14 and a sharp minimum around 320 @xmath14 . for @xmath161000 @xmath14 ( inset of fig 1(i ) ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath15 does not change between 100 and 10 k. this signals that the redistribution of electronic spectral weight ( sw ) associated with the formation of the sc condensate involves an energy scale of around 1000 @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> notably , a sizeable drude - like peak persists even in the sc state at 10 k. its signature was observed also in the reflection and absorption data @xcite , by microwave measurements @xcite and by mm - wave spectroscopy @xcite . evidently , </S>",
    "<S> a significant fraction of quasiparticles ( qp ) does not participate in the macroscopically coherent and thus loss - free response of the sc condensate which is represented in @xmath18 by a delta peak at zero frequency ( @xmath19*@xmath20(@xmath16 ) ) , and in @xmath5 by a term ( @xmath21/@xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the plasma frequency of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> two kinds of processes can be expected to contribute to a finite low - frequency conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , scattering of charge carriers on structural or magnetic defects leads to pair - breaking and thus gives rise to unpaired qp s . </S>",
    "<S> this process should be very efficient for the cuprate htsc with their d - wave sc order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , dephasing processes of the sc condensate can also give rise to a finite conductivity at non - zero frequency . </S>",
    "<S> they can arise for example due to a spatial variation of n@xmath24 such as has recently been proposed based on thz - spectroscopy measurements on bi-2212 @xcite .    in our ellipsometric spectra </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a number of well defined modes . </S>",
    "<S> our result for the sw , s=(@xmath25 , the resonance frequency ( rf ) , @xmath26 , and the half - width at half - maximum , @xmath27 , as obtained from fits with a lorentzian function , is listed in table i. the modes at 280 , 360 , and 600 @xmath14 have been previously identified @xcite and have been assigned to phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> the observation that these modes have a similar sw as in the insulating parent compound yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath28 @xcite has been interpreted in terms of a surprisingly poor screening by the charge carriers of the cuo@xmath0 planes which may be related to an inhomogeneous charge distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these phonons we observe two more modes at 230 and 190 @xmath14 which exhibit a remarkable behavior . </S>",
    "<S> their rf s are close to the ones of some in - plane polarized phonon modes in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath28 ( see table i ) . for both modes </S>",
    "<S> , however , the sw becomes extraordinarily large in the sc state ; at 10 k it exceeds the one of the pure phonon mode by more than an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the sw of a phonon mode is , s=(4@xmath29)@xmath30^{2}/[\\sum_{k}m_{k}\\cdot \\xi _ { k}^{2}\\cdot v_{o}^{2}],$ ] where v@xmath3 is the unit cell volume , e@xmath31 and m@xmath32 are the dynamic charge and the mass of the ion k and @xmath33 its relative direct displacement . </S>",
    "<S> if the two present modes were to be interpreted as pure phonons , their huge sw would imply that they involve dynamic charges far in excess of the ones of the bare ions . </S>",
    "<S> they can thus be rather ascribed to collective electronic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the drastic sw increase below t@xmath3 furthermore suggests that they correspond to excitations of the sc condensate . above t@xmath3 they are hardly detectable and </S>",
    "<S> possibly correspond to the pure phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvectors of the ir phonon modes in y-123 have been previously obtained from lattice dynamical calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one a - polarized mode near 200 @xmath14 involves the in - plane motion of o(2 ) and cu(2 ) against o(3 ) and thus will couple mainly to charge density oscillations within the cuo@xmath0 planes . </S>",
    "<S> the other relevant mode near 170 @xmath14 involves predominantly the motion of o(1 ) against cu(1 ) and therefore is sensitive to charge density oscillations within the cuo chains .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that our ellipsometric data provide sound evidence for the low - energy modes . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show the true dielectric function which is corrected for anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction corrections are smooth functions of d/@xmath34 where d is the sample dimension in the plane of incidence and @xmath34 is the wavelength @xcite and thus can not result in any sharp features . also </S>",
    "<S> , ellipsometry measures the real- and the imaginary parts of @xmath4 independently . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to check the kk - consistency of the spectral features and thus to distinguish them from structures related to noise or imperfections of the setup . </S>",
    "<S> it is also very unlikely that the kk - consistent modes are caused by a damaged surface layer . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is supported by our micro - raman data which are even more sensitive to the surface layer quality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of their large sw , the signature of these modes is rather weak in the normal incidence reflectivity , r , such as displayed in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , they seem to appear in some published spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they have been identified in an earlier absorptivity measurement @xcite .    figures 2(i ) and 2(ii ) display the spectra of @xmath35(@xmath36 ) and @xmath37(@xmath36 ) at 100 and 10 k ( thin and thick solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the broad electronic response again agrees fairly well with the previously reported one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a sizeable anisotropy is evident between the a- and the b - axis response with @xmath38/@xmath15(@xmath16 ) @xmath39 in the ns , and n@xmath40/n@xmath41=(@xmath42/@xmath43(1700 /1200 )@xmath44 in the sc state , with the sc magnetic penetration depth , @xmath45 , derived from @xmath46=lim@xmath47 ( spectra are not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced free carrier response along the b - axis direction was previously explained in terms of the fully oxygenated 1-d cuo chains which are thought to be metallic @xcite and to become sc due to proximity effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our spectra also reveal a large anisotropy of the energy scale of the sc condensation process , i.e. , of the range over which @xmath18(@xmath16 ) is reduced below its value at t@xmath3 . in the b - axis spectrum this energy scale is significantly larger ( it exceeds the measured range ) than in the a - axis one . </S>",
    "<S> a similar trend appears in some reflectivity data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a large anisotropy of the energy scale of the sc condensation process is hardly consistent with the scenario of a proximity induced sc state in the cuo chains which should lead to a decrease of the energy scale rather than to the apparent increase .    </S>",
    "<S> our b - axis spectra contain a surprisingly large number of collective modes . </S>",
    "<S> at least nine modes are resolved in the 10 k spectrum at 140 , 190 , 230 , 260 , 295 340 , 360 , 480 and 560 @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the modes at 230 , 290 and 480 @xmath14 exhibit a doublet structure . </S>",
    "<S> table ii lists the obtained values for s , @xmath48 , and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> only the modes at 360 and 560 @xmath49 have a sw consistent with the assignment to pure phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> the large sw of the modes at 140 , 190 , 230 , 260 , 295 , 340 and 480 @xmath14 suggests again that they involve electronic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these modes preserve a sizeable sw even in the ns , unlike the two a - axis ones which almost disappear above t@xmath3 . for orthorhombic yba@xmath50cu@xmath1o@xmath51 group theory predicts seven ir - active phonon modes for both a- and b - polarization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the multitude of the observed b - polarized modes thus is indicative of an enlarged unit cell or a reduced symmetry along the b - direction . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that 1-d metals are susceptible to structural and electronic instabilities , such as a transition to a dimerized state or a charge density wave state ( cdw ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , recent nqr- and stm measurements indicate that the cuo chains of yba@xmath50cu@xmath1o@xmath51 are in a cdw state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they furthermore suggest that the cuo chains interact with the cuo@xmath0 planes and enhance ( or possibly even induce ) a charge density modulation therein in the sc state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a scenario is consistent with our observation of a - axis electronic modes which develop in the sc  state and a large number of b - axis polarized ones which occur already in the ns . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario of a cdw state within the cuo chains , however , contradicts the explanation of the in - plane anisotropy of the electronic conductivity in terms of metallic cuo chains . </S>",
    "<S> a cdw  is easily pinned by impurities , the cuo chains consequently should be only poorly conductive . </S>",
    "<S> a broad hump around 250 @xmath14 which is very pronounced in the 10 k spectrum may well be associated with localized charge carriers of the cuo chains . </S>",
    "<S> a similar feature has previously been observed along the chain direction in y-123 @xcite and y-124 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent contradiction can be resolved if one associates the a - b - plane anisotropy of the free carrier response with the cuo@xmath0 planes themselves . </S>",
    "<S> given that charge density fluctuations are intrinsic to the cuo@xmath0 planes , the interaction with the cuo chains may indeed induce a strong anisotropy of the electronic response . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent example is the so - called stripe phase model which assumes a pattern of alternating hole rich and hole poor 1-d stripes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> within such a scenario it is feasible that the interaction with the cuo chains causes the stripes to become aligned along the b - direction , some experimental evidence is reported in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an arrangement could indeed account for the observed anisotropy of the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , it would lead to a reduced symmetry along the a - axis direction rather than along the b - axis one such as suggested by our experiments . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that one has to consider both effects , a cdw state within the cuo chains and charge fluctuations within the cuo@xmath0 planes that develop due to the interaction with the 1-d cuo chains . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it will be very interesting to learn whether similar collective modes and anisotropy effects can be observed in other high - t@xmath3 cuprates without 1-d cuo chains .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> by ellipsometry we studied the in - plane fir  dielectric response of detwinned yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a surprisingly large number of collective modes . some of them correspond to in - plane polarized phonons such as observed in undoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> others have an unusually large spectral weight ( sw ) and therefore seem to involve collective excitations of the charge carriers , possibly even of the superconducting condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the collective modes and the free carrier reponse exhibit a pronounced a - b anisotropy . </S>",
