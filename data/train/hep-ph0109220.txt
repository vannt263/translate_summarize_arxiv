    "in order to test the theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) it has long been common practice to confront experimental data with perturbative predictions and then extract fundamental parameters such as the strong coupling @xmath2 . a consistent extraction of @xmath2 from different experiments and different observables points at the correctness of assuming qcd as the underlying theory .",
    "since qcd is a theory where non - perturbative effects play a clear role one has to first question the feasibilty of such an approach and review the role of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . the fact that one can make perturbative predictions to any extent is indeed a blessing and in the case of many observables factorisation theorems allow the separation of pqcd from non - perturbative effects",
    ". simply stated a factorisation theorem implies for an observable @xmath3 @xmath4 in the above we indicate by @xmath5 any set of phase space variables on which the observable may depend and by @xmath6 the hard momentum scale .",
    "@xmath7 is typically a universal operator matrix element which contains non - perturbative information and whose value can be extracted from experiment and tabulated , for example a parton distribution measure . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are perturbative coefficients calculated by using feynman graphs to represent the hard process .",
    "the dots indicate the limitations of the perturbative approach .",
    "the dots in the brackets tell us that there are missing terms in the perturbative series since any perturbative predictions ( even resummed ones ) are missing higher order pieces which can not be easily computed . while this is just a technological limitation in the sense that higher order calculations become rapidly prohibitive computationally , it is a common misconception that given adequate computing power one could have a well defined perturbative answer that would be arbitrarily accurate .    that this belief is ill - founded",
    "can most easily be seen by examining a particular type of contribution ( renormalon graphs ) ( see for examples and further references @xcite ) which give that for large enough @xmath10 the coefficients @xmath11 diverge factorially .",
    "this does not mean that the concept of a perturbative expansion is useless .",
    "what it implies is that pqcd gives an asymptotic approximation to the observable @xmath3 .",
    "the error made in truncating the perturbative expansion is of the order of the first omitted term",
    ". therefore one should carry out the perturbative expansion till the smallest term is reached . the optimal error which is of",
    "the order of this smallest term is thus an unvoidable inherent ambiguity in the perturbative expansion and one finds @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend on the observable and @xmath15 represents the uncertainty of the perturbative estimate .",
    "the coefficient @xmath13 may contain dependence on one or more phase space variables on which @xmath3 depends .    also in eq .",
    "( 1 ) there are dots to indicate that the simple factorisation may not be correct at some level , e.g higher twist .",
    "these contributions are also typically power behaved and the expectation is that in order to obtain an unambigous answer the ambiguity of the perturbative ( pt ) part is cancelled by an ambiguity in the definition of the non - perturbative ( np ) higher twist operators . assuming",
    "further that the size of the ambiguity is proportional to value of np terms ( condensates ) one can use the ambiguity in the pt piece to model np effects which are of a power law type . in other words where there is a large power behaved ambiguity in the pt series it can be treated as a signal that np effects are damaging in proportion .",
    "this assumption is known as ultraviolet dominance of higher twist .",
    "having arrived at the notion that the ambiguity of the perturbative expansion is relevant to the study of power corrections , one is still faced with the task of computing it and comapring with experimental data .",
    "this is conveniently done in the framework of the dispersive approach we shall next discuss .",
    "this method was formulated by dokshitzer , marchesini and webber @xcite and relies on the assumption that the power correction to an observable is given by evaluating the perturbative renormalon graphs and estimating the ensuing ambiguity of the pt series . to investigate this method one",
    "observes that inserting renormalon bubbles on gluon lines in a lowest order feynman graph for a given observable @xmath3 results in the appearance of a running coupling constant .",
    "if this gluon is an internal line inserting renormalon bubbles gives for an observable @xmath3 @xmath16 with @xmath17 representing the gluon virtuality .",
    "the role of the renormalon bubbles is simply to give rise to the running coupling in the integrand above . strictly within a perturbative context",
    "the above integral gives a divergent result due to the divergence of @xmath2 at the landau pole .",
    "this is just the factorial renormalon behaviour discussed previously .    to generate power corrections from the above contribution",
    "the assumption one makes is that the qcd coupling @xmath2 instead of diverging is a well behaved universal function down to small scales , i.e infrared finite .",
    "further knowledge of the exact behaviour of the coupling is not required for us to proceed .",
    "this is certainly not an assumption that can be justified from first principles .",
    "however it leads to simple results that can be easily tested against a wealth of experimental data .",
    "this exercise has been carried out for different observables and so far it seems that experimental data are in support of this notion of a universal ir finite coupling .",
    "assuming that the coupling is analytic except a branch cut across the negative real axis which is a requirement of causality , it follows that one can write the formal dispersion relation @xmath18 where the spectral function @xmath19 represents the discontinuity across the cut , @xmath20    non - perturbative effects at long distances are expected to give rise to a modification in the strong coupling at low scales , @xmath21 , which generates a corresponding modification in the spectral function : @xmath22    from eqs .",
    "( [ master][deltas ] ) it follows that the non - perturbative contribution to @xmath3 , trigerred by a virtual gluon with renormalon insertions and an np modified coupling can be written as @xmath23\\ ] ] a similar equation holds for the real emission contribution and hence in what follws we shall remove the superscript and talk about the sum of real and virtual pieces .    the quantity @xmath24 represents the @xmath25 virtual calculation performed with a finite gluon mass @xmath26 .",
    "the gluon mass is just the dispersive variable in eq .",
    "[ alphas ] and does not imply that one works with a massive gluon field and spoils gauge invariance .",
    "after some further manipulation one gets the following non - perturbative contribution to @xmath3 @xmath27 where , setting @xmath28 , @xmath29 since @xmath30 is limited to low values of @xmath31 , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath32 at large @xmath6 is controlled by the behaviour of @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "[ gdef ] that no terms analytic at @xmath35 can contribute to @xmath32 . on the other hand for a square - root behaviour at small @xmath36 , @xmath37 where we defined the coupling moment",
    "@xmath38 we can express @xmath39 in terms of the average value of @xmath40 in the infrared region , as follows .",
    "we substitute for @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( m^2 ) ( m^2 ) - ( m^2 ) , where @xmath42 represents the expression for @xmath40 corresponding to the part already included in the perturbative prediction .",
    "if the perturbative calculation is carried out to second order in the  renormalization scheme , with renormalization scale @xmath43 , then we have ( m^2 ) = ( ^2 ) + [ b(^2/m^2)+k]^2(^2 ) where for @xmath44 active flavours ( @xmath45 ) b = , k= .",
    "the constant @xmath46 comes from a change of scheme from  to the more physical scheme @xcite in which @xmath40 is preferably defined at low scales . then above some infrared matching scale @xmath47",
    "we assume that @xmath48 and @xmath49 approximately coincide , so that [ a1exp ] _ 1 & & _",
    "0^ dm((m^2)- ( ^2 ) - [ b(^2/m^2)+k]^2(^2 ) ) + & = & ( 0()- ( ^2 ) - [ b(^2/^2)+k+2b]^2(^2 ) ) , where [ a0def ] 0 ( ) _ 0^(m^2)dm .",
    "studies of event shapes in @xmath50 annihilation suggest that @xmath51 for @xmath52 gev , which translates into a value of @xmath53 gev for @xmath54 gev .",
    "here we shall concentrate on the phenomenology of power corrections to event shape variables measured by the h1 and zeus collaborations .",
    "this study is carried out in the breit frame and the current hemisphere @xmath55 is used to define the variables , freeing us from contamination by the proton remnant jet .",
    "some of the observables studied are defined below    * current jet thrust this is constructed by summing the modulii of hadron components along the photon axis in the breit frame .",
    "two normalisations are possible , to @xmath56 on one hand and to the energy in the current hemisphere ( provided this exceeds a certain preset minimum ) .",
    "@xmath57 @xmath58 * current hemisphere jet mass [ rhodef ] = ( _ ah_cp_a)^2/q^2 .",
    "* @xmath59-parameter the @xmath59-parameter is [ cdef ] c=6_a , bh_c|p_a||p_b|^2_ab / q^2",
    ".    there are still other possible definitions and variables studied in addition to the ones mentioned above ( an important one being the jet broadening ) but for illustrative purposes it is enough to restrict the discussion to the variables mentioned .",
    "the power corrections for different event shape variables are given by following the dispersive recepie .",
    "one first computes the one - loop graphs with a finite gluon mass @xmath60 for all the variables mentioned above the leading non - analytic behaviour at small @xmath61 is a @xmath62 singularity .",
    "this leads to @xmath63 power corrections of the form of eq .",
    "[ deltaf1 ]    the coefficients @xmath64 differ from variable to variable and one gets @xmath65 the constant @xmath39 is expected to be approximately universal ( to about @xmath66)as observed in @xmath67 data and with similar values to those found there .",
    "one point that needs to be made in the dis context is that the leading power corrections to most event shapes are independent of the bjorken variable @xmath5 .",
    "this comes about since the @xmath63 effects in question are trigered by a soft gluon , the emission of which does not change the momentum fraction carried by the incoming projectile .",
    "an exception to this is the jet broadening variable where an interplay between this emitted soft gluon and @xmath5 dependent perturbative radiation gives rise to an @xmath5 dependent power correction .",
    "a complete estimate for the broadening power correction relies on a resummed perturbative calculation which shall be published shortly @xcite .",
    "another point that needed to be addressed was one first raised by nason and seymour @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that gluon decay can only be mimimcked by a massive gluon provided one can integrate inclusively over the gluon offspring .",
    "in other words the machinary of the dispersive approach should only strictly be applied to inclusive observables which do not register offspring gluons .",
    "event shapes are not such variables as the offspring gluon momenta affect the event shape .",
    "hence one needs an improved approach where one explicitly treats gluon decay properly .",
    "the two - loop calculations that take gluon decay into proper account were first performed for @xmath50 observables @xcite following this similar work was performed for dis observables @xmath68 .",
    "the conclusions could at first sight be described as surprising .",
    "taking two loop effects into account meant a simple rescaling of the old one - loop coefficients by a universal factor @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "hence the ratios of power corrections to different observables are still given by the ratios of the one - loop coefficents @xmath71 .",
    "this surprising result came about as a result of    * universality of soft gluon radiation . *",
    "common geometrical properties of event shapes they are all linear in the emitted transverse momenta .",
    "[ hum ]    [ mbell ]    another area of investigation at hera is the study of event shape differential distributions @xmath72 and power corrections . here",
    "while data has been available for a while there was a lack of theoretical estimates .",
    "although there are monte carlo programs to make fixed order estimates at @xmath73 this is not sufficient in the above case .",
    "the presence of large logarithms as big as @xmath74 at @xmath75 perturbative order means that a fixed order expansion is not very useful in the small @xmath3 region .    as in @xmath50 one needs to resum all orders till next - to  leading logarithmic accuracy to describe the data .",
    "this resummation program has been started @xcite and results for many variables are soon to be published @xcite .",
    "however a preliminary comparison to data has already begun .",
    "the power corrections to different event shape distributions result in simple shifts of the perturbative spectra , the amount of the shift is exactly equal to the @xmath63 correction to the corresponding mean values .",
    "@xmath76 where @xmath64 for the different variables are quoted .",
    "again the jet broadening is different and does not show a simple shift of the pt spectrum giving instead a variable dependent shift as in @xmath67 .",
    "the experimental results from h1 and zeus ( see figs .  1 and 2 ) have been available for quite some time for mean values whereas fits to distributions are on the way . for the mean values",
    "the fits are best summarised by plotting error ellipses in the @xmath77 plane where @xmath78 is the parameter introduced in eq .",
    "[ a1exp ] .",
    "some brief comments about the results are in order . in the h1 results one should note that the jet mass ellipse is shifted and falls in line with expectations from other variables provided one neglects hadron masses ( the relevant ellipse is labelled @xmath79 ) in keeping with the theoretical approximations made . for",
    "a fuller discussion of this point see @xcite . in the zeus plot one",
    "notices the effect of large systematic errors .",
    "zeus have also studied the @xmath5 dependence of power corrections and as noted before in this article the power correction to the jet broadening variable displays a clear @xmath5 dependence which comes from the anomalous dimension matrix @xcite .",
    "in addition one remarks that that the values of the @xmath80 parameter obtained from dis event shapes has similar values ( 0.40.5 ) as for @xmath67 variables and this seems to support the hypothesis of a universal infrared finite coupling .",
    "the spread in @xmath2 values however is still uncomfortably large and is a potential area for improvement .    finally turning to differential distributions one can use a nominal value of @xmath81 and @xmath82 and the resummation of @xcite .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "3 are produced by binning like the h1 data which is responsible for their non - smooth nature .",
