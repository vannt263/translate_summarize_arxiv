    "a polarization survey of diffuse galactic emission provides a direct image of the transverse magnetic field , if faraday rotation is negligible .",
    "the sino - german @xmath06  cm polarization survey of the galactic plane was set as the main task for the partner group of the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie ( mpifr ) at the national astronomical observatories of chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) , which was commissioned in 2001 .",
    "previously the effelsberg 100  m telescope was used to map the galactic polarized emission up to medium latitudes@xcite at 1.4  ghz with an angular resolution of @xmath4 .",
    "part of the data were used to compensate the missing large - scale structures in the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps)@xcite observed with the drao synthesis telescope at @xmath5 angular resolution . at 1.4  ghz ,",
    "mainly polarized emission from the local interstellar medium is observed @xcite .",
    "the polarization survey by the westerbork synthesis radio telescope at 350  mhz@xcite penetrates through an even shorter distance into the magneto - ionic medium .",
    "earlier 2.7  ghz galactic plane polarization surveys were made with the effelsberg 100  m telescope@xcite at @xmath6 resolution tracing more distant emission .",
    "the galactic plane in the southern sky was surveyed by the parkes telescope at 2.4  ghz@xcite , while sections of the galactic plane were observed with the australian telescope compact array at 1.4  ghz with a high angular resolution@xcite .",
    "the observing frequencies of previous polarization surveys are all lower than 3  ghz , which implies a small distance to the polarization horizon . in other words ,",
    "the results suffer significant depolarization for distant emission . to penetrate even deeper into the magneto - ionic medium ,",
    "observations at higher frequencies are required .    using the urumqi 25  m radio telescope ,",
    "the sino - german @xmath06  cm polarization survey covers the galactic plane from @xmath7 and @xmath8 with an angular resolution of @xmath9 , which enables us to see through the complex magneto - ionized structures even for a @xmath10 of several hundred rad  m@xmath11 . in the inner galaxy of @xmath12 ,",
    "the radio emission at this frequency comes from diffuse emission and individual objects of a few spiral arms@xcite . towards the direction of @xmath13 ,",
    "the line of sight is tangential to the local arm , and the large - scale magnetic fields run parallel to the line of sight .",
    "there are many objects and structures of different distances in this projected area , forming a radio complex . in the galactic anti - center region ( @xmath14 )",
    ", the emission comes from the perseus arm and maybe also a weaker outer arm , where the large - scale magnetic fields run almost perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the sino - german @xmath06  cm polarization survey of the galactic plane has been conducted using the urumqi 25  m telescope of xinjiang ( former urumqi ) astronomical observatory , chinese academy of sciences .",
    "the telescope is located about 70  km south of urumqi city at an altitude of 2029  m above sea level with the geographic longitude 87@xmath15e and latitude 43@xmath15n .",
    "the dual - channel @xmath06  cm receiver was designed by mr .",
    "otmar lochner and constructed at mpifr in germany , based on a receiver used at the effelsberg 100 m telescope .",
    "the new receiver has a higher stability and a lower 1/f - noise . in 2004 ,",
    "the receiver was installed at the secondary focus of the urumqi 25  m telescope .",
    "the @xmath06 cm system includes a corrugated feed horn and an orthogonal transducer to convert the signal into left - hand ( l ) and right - hand ( r ) polarization channels .",
    "the signal of the two channels is amplified by cooled hemt pre - amplifiers working below 15  k in a dewar and then mixed with the local oscillator signal .",
    "two splitters follow , which split one set of l and r channels into two sets , one used to directly detect the power of @xmath16=ll * and @xmath17=rr * for stokes @xmath18 , and the other one is feed into the if polarimeter for producing lr * and rl * for the stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the voltage - frequency converters in the focus cabin are used for converting the detected voltage signals to frequencies , which enables the long - distance transportation of the signals to a digital backend in the observatories control room .",
    "a mpifr pocket backend counts the frequency - coded signals from the four polarization channels ( rr * , ll * , rl * , lr * ) at a sampling rate of 32  msec .",
    "every 32  msec the frontend setting changes , so that either a calibration signal of 1.7  k @xmath21 is added to the antenna signal and/or the signal phase is shifted by @xmath22 . for two subsequent phases within a cycle , the calibration signal is switched on , so that any gain changes of the system can be monitored .",
    "the phase of the output signals is switched by @xmath22 alternatively for every phase , so that the quadratic terms of the polarimeter are canceled .",
    "in one whole cycle of 128 ms , four combinations of different settings of calibration and phase - switching are realized .",
    "survey parameters of the urumqi @xmath06  cm system +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the raw data are transfered to a linux pc via the tcp / ip protocol and stored on disk for further processing in the mbfits format developed for the effelsberg 100  m telescope . by using the toolbox - software package ,",
    "the raw data of the four backend channels ( rr * , ll * , rl * , lr * ) are converted from a time series into a tabulated format with a user specified spatial separation on the sky using a sinc - interpolation function .",
    "the calibration signals of each subscan ( row or column ) of a map are extracted and fitted to account for any gain drifting and also to control the phase stability of the if polarimeter .",
    "the tabulated maps are then transformed into nod2 maps@xcite with the polarization u and q - channels corrected for parallactic angles .",
    "the linux pc is also used to command the telescope control computer to move the telescope in a number of different astronomical coordinate systems ( ra / dec or @xmath23 ) and in the azimuth / elevation coordinate system of the telescope .",
    "test observations were made in august 2004 , and the relevant system and antenna parameters were determined ( see table 1 ) . by periodically injecting a known signal , we got the system temperature measured as 22  k  t@xmath24 when the @xmath06  cm receiver is pointing to the zenith of a clear sky . the strong radio source 3c  286",
    "is used to determine other parameters , such as the beam size , effective collecting area , main beam efficiency and gain .",
    "indian satellites which are known to emit strong in the @xmath06  cm band were observed to estimate the instrumental effects , e.g. the side lobes .",
    "the unpolarized radio source 3c  295 was used to calculate the leakage of the total intensity into the polarization channels , namely the instrumental polarization . from these tests",
    ", we found the @xmath06  cm beam is rather symmetric and the first side lobes , are less than 2% of the main beam .",
    "cross - scans were made in two orthogonal directions to the source 3c  286 , and showed that the pointing accuracy of the system is stable and the offset is negligible in comparison with the beam size .    during the test observations , we identified internal and external interferences .",
    "tthe observatory s pulsar filter - bank backend introduced the major internal interference , and was switched off during the @xmath06  cm observations .",
    "the external interferences came from the ground radiation and the indian satellites .",
    "the nanshan mountains around the site induce significant ground radiation picked up by the sidelobes of the telescope , which produce a non - flat baseline for scans of low elevations@xcite .",
    "for the required survey quality , observations must be done at elevations larger than 20@xmath15 , so that the baseline from the ground radiation can be well subtracted by a first - order or second - order polynomial fit .",
    "there are four locations of geostationary indian satellites , which emit strong signals in the @xmath06 cm band , were observed at the azimuths and elevations of ( 222.61@xmath15 , 30.34@xmath15 ) , ( 198.53@xmath15 , 38.19@xmath15 ) , ( 186.06@xmath15 , 39.7@xmath15 ) , and ( 170.85@xmath15 , 39.4@xmath15 ) , which emit strong signals up to 4810  mhz with a flux density of @xmath2560000  jy .",
    "our @xmath06  cm system suffers from their signals even tens of degrees away via telescope side lobes . in november 2005",
    ", the receiver was equipped with a switched bandpass filter . when it is switched on",
    ", the lower band is cut off , and the central observing frequency is shifted from 4800  mhz to 4963  mhz , and the bandwidth is cut from 600  mhz to 295  mhz .",
    "we have to use this narrow band to observe the southern parts of the galactic plane .",
    "the @xmath06  cm system is very sensitive recording , for instance , any vibration of the thin rf - transparent membrane of of the focus - cabin by wind or small temperature variations in the focus cabin , which was fixed .",
    "however , effects by a bird or clouds passing the telescope beam and , in particular , emission from the sun picked up by the telescope side lobes could not be fixed .",
    "therefore , the survey observations were always carried out in clear nights .",
    "the @xmath06  cm survey observations started in august 2004 , and finished in april 2009 .",
    "a very large section of the galactic plane of 2200 square degrees for @xmath26 and @xmath27 has been scanned in two orthogonal directions : along the galactic longitude for the @xmath28 map and along the galactic latitude for the @xmath29 map .",
    "considering the stability of the system and the variable ground radiation , scans must be done for a finite size in a given range of the sky . for a @xmath28 map ,",
    "the typical map size of @xmath30 is @xmath31 ; for a @xmath29 map it is @xmath32 .",
    "there is always a small overlap of the different patches . before and after observations for each map ,",
    "calibrators are observed .",
    "3c  286 served as our main calibrator .",
    "it has an integrated flux density of @xmath33  jy at @xmath06  cm , 11.3% polarization fraction , and a polarization angle of 33@xmath15 .",
    "3c  48 and 3c  138 were used as secondary calibrators . the unpolarized radio source",
    "3c  295 was also frequently observed for the cleaning of the instrumental polarization .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the original survey data were stored in a linux pc .",
    "we used the `` toolbox '' and `` mapax '' software originally developed at the mpifr for the data reduction of effelsberg continuum and polarization observations .",
    "there are several steps in data processing .",
    "the maps were first edited to remove spiky interference and obvious very bad scans due to interference .",
    "then we corrected baseline curvatures by polynomial fitting and suppressed scanning effects by applying an `` unsharp masking method''@xcite .",
    "all individual maps were therefore on a relative baselevel , where the two ends of each subscan were set to zero .",
    "the instrumental polarization , mainly the leakage of total power emission into the polarization channels , was determined by observations of the unpolarized calibrators 3c  295 and 3c  147 , and corrected using the  rebeam `` method@xcite .",
    "then the intensity calibrations was made to each map . finally , we weaved the processed @xmath28 maps and @xmath29 maps together by using the ' ' plait \" method@xcite , which further reduced remaining scanning effects , to form the stokes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 survey maps .",
    "the survey strategy together with the results from a test region of @xmath34 was published in the first survey paper@xcite .",
    "for every sky area , in general , we performed observations for more than one @xmath28 map and @xmath29 map . combining all observations together , we obtained the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 maps for the whole survey region .",
    "the r.m.s .- noise in the @xmath18 map is about 1.0  mk t@xmath35 , and in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 maps it is about 0.5  mk t@xmath35 .",
    "all survey data have been released at the end of 2010 .",
    "see fig .  1 for a section of survey maps .",
    "it is by far the highest frequency in a ground - based polarization galactic plane survey .",
    "the total intensity maps show much stronger diffuse emission towards the inner galaxy ( @xmath36 ) originating from spiral arms@xcite . for the mixed emission in the inner region of the galactic plane , by using the multi - frequency total power data together with our @xmath06  cm map",
    ", we separated the thermal bremsstrahlung emission component and the non - thermal synchrotron emission component@xcite , we found that the thermal emission is about 60% of the detected @xmath06  cm emission . in the outer galaxy@xcite ,",
    "the most outstanding region is the cygnus complex located at about @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where indistinguishable radio emission from hii regions and other objects accumulates in the tangential direction of the local arm@xcite . in the anti - centre region of @xmath39 , most prominent are large hii regions and supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the perseus arm@xcite .",
    "when eliminating the ground radiation with polynomial fits as stated above , polarized emission with spatial scale of the scan length of each small survey area is filtered out .",
    "absolute baselevels for @xmath19 and @xmath20 are important to calculate correct polarization angles and intensities .",
    "missing large - scale components leads to a misinterpretation of polarization data . for the @xmath06  cm survey , the ongoing c - band all - sky survey ( cbass ) might provide the missing large - scale emission",
    "however , cbass data are not yet available .",
    "the best we can do at present is to restore the large - scale @xmath19 and @xmath20 components at @xmath06  cm using the wmap k - band ( 22.8  ghz ) polarization data@xcite .",
    "the spectral index of the polarization intensity of the synchrotron emission in the plane varies from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 maps of high - latitude regions at 22.8  ghz were scaled to @xmath06  cm ( 4.8  ghz ) according to the spectral index @xmath42 to restore the baselevel of @xmath06  cm @xmath19 and @xmath20 maps , from which the @xmath43 and @xmath44 maps are obtained .    from the polarization map of the survey area",
    ", we found many polarization patches and depolarization structures of different scales@xcite .",
    "the prominent objects are again large hii regions because of their depolarization and snrs because of their polarized emission .",
    "there are also many polarized spurs and `` depolarized canals '' .",
    "a few large polarized patches with an angular size of a few degrees are probably discrete features within 1  kpc .",
    "we have studied the fluctuation properties in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath43 maps in the survey region of @xmath45 by a structure function analysis@xcite . although the indices of the structure functions are always close to about 0.5 , the fluctuation power is much lower for the anti - center region .",
    "more enhanced polarization structures on small scales give much more fluctuation power towards the inner galaxy@xcite .",
    "the @xmath06  cm polarization horizon in the inner galaxy is about 4  kpc@xcite , which means that the observed polarized radiation comes from the sagittarius and scutum arm .",
    "large hii regions are prominent radio sources in the @xmath06  cm total power map . in our polarization map",
    ", they often appear due to their depolarization and faraday rotation .    along the periphery of many large hii regions ( a few degrees in size ) , very clear depolarization has been found in our restored polarization map@xcite .",
    "this indicates either strong magnetic fields or large electron density towards the boundaries of hii regions .",
    "the regular magnetic fields in hii regions have been studied recently by using the rotation measure data@xcite .",
    "a detailed modelling is in progress .",
    "polarization angles in some regions of degrees in size significantly deviate from the surroundings@xcite , which are caused by foreground faraday screens .",
    "these screens have a very small electron density and therefore can not be detected in total intensity .",
    "our modeling shows that the line of sight component of the magnetic fields in the screens is up to tens of @xmath46 g , much stronger than the average interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "the nature of faraday screens remains unclear .",
    "because of the intermediate beam size of the @xmath06  cm observation system , we have advantage to map large snrs of several degrees in size , which is a very ambitious task for large radio telescopes with very small beams .    the first @xmath06  cm test observation@xcite was carried out to the large snr cygnus loop ( g74.0@xmath38.5 ) , with the apparent size of @xmath47 .",
    "we obtained a total intensity image , from which we derived the integrated flux density at @xmath06  cm and the radio spectrum from 408  mhz to 4.8  ghz when combined with the flux densities from the literature .",
    "the spectrum does not show any steepening .",
    "our new @xmath06  cm polarization image indicates a distinct magnetic field configuration for the northern and southern part of the snr , which may support the idea for the cygnus loop resulting from two smaller snrs@xcite .    in the survey test region@xcite of @xmath48 , we studied the snrs g126.2 + 1.6 and g127.1 + 0.5 . for the former we excluded the suggested spectral break @xcite at about 1  ghz .",
    "we have also studied 17 supernova remnants in the survey region which are larger than @xmath49 in the fifth survey paper @xcite and 50 smaller ones in the seventh survey paper@xcite . using the urumqi data , we determined the flux densities at @xmath06  cm . together with the flux density data at other frequencies from literature , we derived the radio spectra of these snrs .",
    "a number of the previously reported flux densities and spectral indices were corrected / improved by our new measurements .",
    "some large snrs are outside the survey region .",
    "we have also observed them and studied individually .",
    "besides the cygnus loop@xcite , the faintest snr in the galaxy , g156.2 + 5.7@xcite , was imaged in total intensity and polarization by urumqi @xmath06  cm and effelsberg",
    "@xmath011  cm observations .",
    "a highly polarized central patch is detected , and the toroidal magnetic field configuration is identified for the snr . for the large snr in the anti - center region of the galactic plane , s147 ,",
    "the high quality urumqi @xmath06  cm data confirm the spectral break@xcite of the snr at about 1.5  ghz@xcite .",
    "two populations of electrons with different energy spectral indices are responsible for the diffuse emission and the filamentary emission component . using the urumqi @xmath06  cm flux density data , together with effelsberg @xmath011  cm and @xmath021  cm data",
    "( see http : //www.mpifr.de /survey.html ) , we clarify that snr hb3 has a straight spectrum@xcite with a spectral index of @xmath50 between 1.4  ghz and 4.8  ghz , which is consistent with that at frequencies below 1  ghz@xcite and rejected the suggested spectral flattening above 1  ghz@xcite .",
    "for another faint snr g65.2 + 5.7 , we obtained the integrated radio spectral index from 83  mhz to 4.8  ghz@xcite and estimated the magnetic field strength in the southern filamentary shell using new @xmath06  cm and effelsberg @xmath011  cm polarization data . using the polarization maps of the urumqi @xmath06  cm and effelsberg @xmath011  cm observations , together with data in literature , the spectral index and its distribution as well as the magnetic fields of the shell and central branch of snr cta  1 were studied@xcite .",
    "a possible foreground faraday screen partly covering cta  1 was identified from the rotation measure distribution .    in summary , of all ( @xmath51 80 ) known snrs we investigated with the urumqi data , for 10% of them polarization",
    "was newly detected and 35% of them the integrated flux densities were measured for the first time at @xmath06  cm .",
    "the urumqi data are at the highest frequency for more than 50% of the snrs , which play an important role in determining their spectral indices . the survey gives the first ( complete ) polarization images for about 30% of the snrs , which is important to understand the magnetic field structure of the snrs .    using the high - quality data of the urumqi @xmath06  cm and effelsberg @xmath011  cm and @xmath021  cm data , we have disproved three objects , g192.8@xmath31.1@xcite , g166.2 + 2.5 ( oa184)@xcite , and g16.8@xmath31.1@xcite , as being snrs .",
    "their emission turns out to be thermal without any polarization , and hence they are very probably hii regions .",
    "sensitive surveys always lead to new discoveries , so does the urumqi @xmath06  cm survey .",
    "with the high sensitivity of the @xmath06  cm system , we were able to discover two new shell - type snrs : g178.2@xmath34.2 and g25.1@xmath32.3@xcite .",
    "g178.2@xmath34.2 has a size of @xmath52 with strongly polarized emission along its northern shell .",
