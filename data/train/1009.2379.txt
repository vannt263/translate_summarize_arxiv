    "irradiating liquid metal ( usually mercury ) with proton beams is up to now the best method to produce high - intensity , multi - purpose neutron beams .",
    "this method has been used in various existing facilities and it is planned to be used in the european spallation source , too . unfortunately upon adsorbing the high - intensity proton beam in the liquid ,",
    "the neutrons are not the only ones emitted ; an unavoidable heat and pressure wave will be emitted simulataneously from the adsorption region .",
    "the increase of the temperature and ( in the negative period of the pressure wave ) the decrease of the pressure can cause cavitation in the liquid .",
    "the metal vapor bubbles then will flow with the liquid and upon reaching high pressure and low temperature regions , they will collapse , causing severe damage in nearby solid structures .",
    "this phenomenon is known as cavitation erosion and one of the main factors which ( due to pitting and weight loss ) shorten the lifetime of structural materials significantly . therefore",
    "to avoid cavitation is one of the main challenges of the design of the spallation source target @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here , the along the methods to minimize cavitation itself , there are two other ways to minimize the damage .",
    "one of them are the various ways of surface treatments ( plasma nitriding , plasma carbonizing , etc . ) , which makes the surface more resistant to the damaging pressure wave emitted by the collapsing bubble @xcite .",
    "the other one is the addition of helium micro - bubbles , which is a proven way to soften up and to reduce the damage by absorbing the expansion of liquid mercury and mitigating the pressure waves @xcite . considering this method as a successful one to deal with the pressure - drop induced cavitation , in our paper",
    "we focused mainly on the temperature increase induced cavitation and allowed only small pressure changes to occur ( down to -5 bar ) .",
    "our main aim is to determine whether the conditions ( temperature and pressure changes ) are able to cause cavitation or not .",
    "we approached the problem in three steps . in the first step ( section  [ sec.2 ] ) , we calculated the phase equilibrium , stability limit and various other properties of mercury by using the equation of state proposed by morita et al . @xcite . in the next step ( section  [ sec.3 ] ) , we made some estimation for the magnitude of pressure and temperature changes by using single and repeated proton pulses on mercury . in the final step ( section  [ sec.4 ] )",
    ", we calculated the work of critical bubble formation in mercury as well as the rate of homogeneous nucleation in the pressure - temperature range defined according to the results of the previous section . the paper is completed by a summary and discussion ( section  [ sec.5 ] ) .",
    "for the description of mercury ( hg ) in both the liquid and gas phases , we will apply a slightly modified thermal equation of state as compared to the expression proposed by morita et al .",
    "( see @xcite , and , in particular , eq . ( 15 ) in @xcite ) .",

    ", we get the specific volume of the liquid phase ( @xmath35 ) , from the right branch of the binodal curve , we obtain the specific volume of the gas ( @xmath36 ) . for @xmath37 ,",
    "both solutions coincide in the critical point ( @xmath38 , again .",
    "consequently , in order to determine the specific volumes of the liquid and the gas at some given temperature in the range @xmath39 , we have to specify the location of the binodal curve .",

    "for the determination of the pressure and temperature change , a `` one dimensional six - equation two - fluid model '' was used , which is capable to describe transients like pressure waves , quick evaporation or condensation which is proportional to cavitation caused by energetic proton interaction in mercury target @xcite .",
    "the method was developed to describe the sudden and drastic steam condensation , called water hammer @xcite .",
    "the model contains six first - order partial - differential equations which describe one - dimensional surface - averaged mass , momentum and energy conservation laws for both phases .",
    "a special numerical procedure ensures that shock - waves can be described without any numerical dispersion . with two major modifications",
    "this model can be applied to investigate the thermo - hydraulic properties of the planned mercury target in the european spallation source ( ess ) .",
    "these modifications are the following : the equation of state namely the density and the internal energy of both mercury phases should be known in a broad range of pressure ( 1 pa to 100 mpa ) and temperature ( 273 k to 1000 k ) . as a second point",
    "the interaction of the high energy proton beam with mercury has to be included .",
    "this is a much simpler task because we may consider that about 50 % of the 300 kj / pulse beam energy is absorbed as a 2ms long heat shock square pulse , giving a new source terms in the energy equation of the liquid phase .",
    "the ess mercury target station is modeled as a 18 meter long closed loop which is in three dimension the pipe diameter 15 cm .",
    "we consider that 150 kj heat is absorbed in a 10 cm long pipe , this is approximately the width of the proton pulse .",
    "calculation shows that such a single pulse heats up the mercury with about 40 - 44 k , assuming that the initial temperature was between 293 - 373 k ( i.e. within the normal working range of the spallation source ) . in the calculations , low velocities 0.5 - 4 m / s , low initial pressure 1 - 4",
    "bar and low initial temperature ( below 374 k ) were assumed . to our knowledge",
    "the existing japanese spallation neutron source hg loop is about 15 m long , with a diameter of 15 cm , the flow velocity of hg is 0.7 m / s and the pressure is approximately equal to 1 bar .",
    "concerning the pressure change , the model is able to estimate the positive part , but at the negative region ( where most of the low temperature cavitation is expected to happen @xcite ) , a stability problem aroused .",
    "therefore we focused our calculation to the heat shock and , at present , neglected the pressure change .",
    "preliminary calculation yielded a few bar changes @xcite , in agreement with the results of ida @xcite , therefore the latter calculations were performed in the -5 to 10 bar range .",
    "we should mention here , that other models predicted much larger pressure changes ( even hundreds of bars ) @xcite both in the positive and negative pressure region .",
    "also the effects of repeated pulses were checked .",
    "the calculations were performed with a 2 ms square pulse train where the delay time was 20 ms which is similar to a 16hz repetition rate .",
    "we started with a flow system with initial p=4 bar , @xmath77 k and initial flow velocity v = 4 m / s .",
    "we found that the temperature jumps are more or less additive which means that after the beginning of the third pulse the temperature was about 430 k.",
    "let us assume , now , that the system is brought suddenly into a metastable state located between binodal curve and spinodal curve at the liquid branch of the equation of state .",
    "then , by nucleation and growth processes , bubbles may appear spontaneously in the liquid and a phase separation takes place @xcite . based on the relations outlined above",
    ", we will determine now the parameters of the critical clusters governing bubble nucleation in dependence on the state parameters , pressure and temperature .",

    "this relation holds generally provided - as we assume - the state of the ambient liquid phase remains unchanged by the formation of one bubble .",
    "for a one - component system ( as discussed here ) , this expression is reduced to @xmath81\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the independent variables , we select the size of the bubble , @xmath82 and the molar volume of the gas phase in the bubble . similarly to @xcite , we arrive then at @xmath83 where the following notations have been introduced : @xmath84@xmath85@xmath86the dependence of the scaling parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 on the reduced temperature is shown in fig .",

    "[ figure.10 ] . in fig .",
    "[ figure.11 ] , the dependence of the nucleation rates on temperature for the same values of pressure are shown ( a value of the pre - exponential factor of @xmath100s@xmath101m@xmath102 has been used for the calculations ) .",
    "one can see , that in such case homogeneous nucleation is possible only at very high temperatures , near @xmath103 .",
    "one can observed as well that concerning a 20 cm diameter sphere ( region of proton adsorption ) and 2 ms time span , one can expect 1 or more nucleation event above 1530.5 k. however , heterogeneous nucleation may occur also at lower temperatures .",
    "in spallation neutron sources , liquid mercury is the subject of big thermal and pressure shocks ( including negative part ) , upon adsorbing the proton beam . increased temperature and decreased pressure can cause instable bubbles which can cause cavitation erosion of the structural material , shortening the life - time of the equipment and contaminating the mercury with tiny steel pieces .",
    "therefore it is crucial to avoid or minimize bubble nucleation .",
    "while pressure shock can be softened by adding helium micro - bubbles to the mercury , there is no way to deal with the thermal shock ( i.e. local heating is not possible in the middle of the liquid mercury ) .",
    "therefore our calculation focused on to calculate the extent of the temperature increase , the work of critical cluster formation ( i.e. the nucleus of a macroscopic bubble ) and the nucleation rate .",
    "it has been shown that after repeated proton pulses the temperature can be increased with a few hundred k , but the nucleation rate is so low that the possibility of homogeneous nucleation ( i.e. bubble formation in the pure mercury ) is highly improbable , even when the pressure goes below the vapor pressure .",
