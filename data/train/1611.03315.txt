    "recent decades abound with research on the strongly correlated systems having instabilities of inner @xmath8-electron shells , mainly due to a wide range of fascinating phenomena discovered in those systems , such as  heavy - fermion ( hf ) superconductivity \" , kondo insulators , valence fluctuation ( vf ) , non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior , quantum criticality etc.@xcite moreover , long - range magnetic ordering in the system can be destabilized by tuning external or internal ( alloying ) pressure or by application of external magnetic field leading the system to the borderline between magnetically ordered and nonmagnetic ground states .",
    "the precarious point of instability between two stable phases of matter is called the ` quantum critical point ' ( qcp ) which is the playground of new interesting physics .",
    "in addition to that , valence instability which is prone to occur near the middle of the lanthanide series , is a key factor which governs the ground state and can also lead the system to qcp . while most experimental and theoretical efforts have been focused on the ce and yb",
    "elements,@xcite the eu compounds are relatively unexplored .",
    "similar to those of ce and yb based systems , one can tune the electronic ground state of eu compounds .",
    "however , the evolution of the valence @xmath9 of eu - based systems as a function of temperature @xmath10 and composition @xmath6 or pressure @xmath11 differs strongly from the phase diagrams for ce or yb systems . in ce or yb systems , increasing the hybridization results in a smooth and continuous evolution of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath11 or @xmath6 and the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath2 decreases continuously to zero value at a quantum critical point.@xcite on the other hand , for eu - based systems , increasing hybridization leads to a slight increase in @xmath2 rather than decreasing . at a critical value an abrupt transition to an almost trivalent",
    "eu ground state occurs .",
    "the characteristic phase diagram for eu systems was first established in the system eu(pd@xmath3au@xmath4)@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , and later was confirmed in eu(pt@xmath3ni@xmath4)@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "ni substitution for pt in eupt@xmath0si@xmath0 acts as a chemical pressure in the system and suppresses the antiferromagnetism ( afm ) completely .",
    "more recently , the substitution of si in eucu@xmath0ge@xmath0 was shown to be of particular interest because the rare - earth ion configuration changes from nearly integral valence eu@xmath12 in antiferromagnetic eucu@xmath0ge@xmath0 to a valence fluctuating state in eucu@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "a strong electron mass enhancements was reported in the compounds near the crossover from magnetic to non - magnetic state @xcite .",

    "one advantage of substituting ge for p instead of e.g. fe for ni is that both euni@xmath0p@xmath0 and euni@xmath0ge@xmath0 crystallize in the so called  collapsed structure \" , while substituting fe for ni results in a change from collapsed to non - collapsed structure , for which one can expect strong disorder effect .",
    "the compound euni@xmath0p@xmath0 exhibits valence fluctuating behavior and possess a gradual change of the eu valence with decreasing temperature.@xcite the temperature dependence of eu valence was also probed by mossbauer spectroscopy where isomer shift gradually moves with decreasing temperature from -6.4  mm / s at room temperature to -4.4mm / s at 4.2  k. @xcite photoemission spectroscopy study on high quality single crystals of euni@xmath0p@xmath0 revealed the presence of heavy bands in the compound @xcite . on the other hand , isostructural euni@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite exhibits a stable divalent eu state which orders antiferromagnetically at 30.8  k. anticipating the fact that ge substitution for p in euni@xmath0p@xmath0 may change the magnetic ground state of eu and the system may exhibit quantum critical behavior at the magnetic non - magnetic borderline , we have carried out a systematic study of euni@xmath0(p@xmath3ge@xmath4)@xmath0 system .",

    "the starting elements eu , ni , ( p@xmath3ge@xmath4 ) and sn were taken in the ratio of 2:1:1.2:5 and the mixture was placed in an alumina crucible and subsequently sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule .",
    "the sealed quartz ampoule was slowly heated to 1050@xmath13c and held at that temperature for 20 hours for proper mixing .",
    "it was then cooled down at a rate of 2@xmath13c / h down to 500@xmath13c and then rapidly brought down to room temperature in two hours .",
    "single crystals were removed by etching the sn flux using dilute hcl .",
    "we obtained plate - like single crystals with different sizes depending on the ge concentration varied from 4@xmath144@xmath140.2  mm@xmath15 to 2@xmath142@xmath140.1  mm@xmath15 .",
    "the samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction with cu-@xmath16 radiation to determine the phase purity and crystal structure .",
