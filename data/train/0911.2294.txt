    "it is well - known that mixing by an incompressible flow enhances diffusion in many contexts .",
    "this is demonstrated , for instance , by the fact that the effective diffusivity of a periodic incompressible flow is always larger than diffusion in the absence of a flow  @xcite , or that the principal eigenvalue @xmath8 of the problem @xmath9 is never smaller than the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath10 of with @xmath7 .",
    "classes of flows which are most effective in enhancing diffusion have been studied both on bounded and unbounded domains , and their characterizations have been provided in  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it was observed in  @xcite that an incompressible flow may actually slow down diffusion in the following sense .",
    "consider the explosion problem @xmath11 there exists @xmath12 such that this problem has a solution for all @xmath13 and no solution for @xmath14 ( see @xcite for @xmath7 and  @xcite for @xmath15 ) .",
    "surprisingly , it was shown _ numerically _ in  @xcite that in a long rectangle there are incompressible flows with @xmath16 .",
    "this means that addition of a flow ( which typically increases @xmath17 due to mixing ) can sometimes instead promote the creation of hotspots and inhibit their interaction with the cold boundary @xmath18 .",
    "the present paper is a step toward mathematical understanding of this diffusion slowdown effect of certain incompressible flows .",
    "we consider the problem @xmath19 on a smooth bounded domain @xmath20 , with @xmath21 an incompressible flow on @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) which is tangential to @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath23 on @xmath18 , with @xmath24 the outward normal to @xmath18 ) .",
    "physically , the solution @xmath25 is the expected exit time from @xmath3 of the random process @xmath26 modeling the motion of a diffusing particle advected by the flow @xmath5 . although one might think that the expected exit time is always decreased by the addition of an incompressible flow due to improved mixing , this need not be the case .",
    "our first result shows that in any bounded simply connected domain in @xmath27 which is not a disk , there are ( regular ) incompressible flows which _ increase _ the maximum of the expected exit time of @xmath28 from @xmath3 .",
    "[ thmworseonnondisk]let @xmath29 be a bounded simply connected domain with a @xmath30 boundary which is not a disk .",
    "then there exists a @xmath30 , divergence free vector field @xmath31 tangential to @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "_ we note that the incompressible flows are the natural class to study in this context .",
    "indeed , if one considers general @xmath34 ( not necessarily divergence free ) , then it is easy to show that @xmath35 can be made arbitrarily large by , for instance , taking @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 sufficiently large .    on a disk however , no ( incompressible ) stirring will increase this expected exit time beyond the one for @xmath7 .",
    "in fact we prove in any dimension that the @xmath39-norm of the expected exit time can never be larger than that from a disk of equal volume with @xmath7 .",

    "if @xmath3 is simply connected and @xmath61 has a single ( non - degenerate ) critical point ( in which case either @xmath68 or @xmath69 on @xmath3 , and we will assume without loss the former ) , then we have the explicit formula @xmath70 here and elsewhere we let @xmath71 , the @xmath72-super - level set of @xmath61 .",

    "we will start by considering only flows with the above property .",
    "that is , @xmath5 is @xmath58 and such that the stream function @xmath61 only has a single critical point in @xmath3 ( which is simply connected and @xmath68 on @xmath3 ) . in particular , all super - level sets of @xmath61 are simply connected and @xmath61 attains a single maximum @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , any @xmath75 is a regular value of @xmath61 and @xmath76 is a @xmath63 jordan curve .",

    "this together with ( [ aug182 ] ) implies that @xmath84 .",
    "that is , such solutions @xmath61 to the poisson problem solve the freidlin problem for themselves .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case @xmath85 , with @xmath86 solving @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "notice that then @xmath89 also solves @xmath90 for any @xmath91 and so @xmath92 .",
    "let us therefore assume , for now , that @xmath3 is such that @xmath89 has a single critical point .",
    "we now assume that for any incompressible flow @xmath5 on @xmath3 we have @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , @xmath94 for each @xmath5 whose stream function has a single critical point .",
    "we will now show that this is the case only when @xmath3 is a disc , thus proving theorem  [ thmworseonnondisk ] for all @xmath3 such that @xmath89 has a single critical point .",
    "the key ingredient of our proof is that for all `` infinite amplitude '' expected exit times @xmath67 , we have a variational principle which gives an explicit equation satisfied by the critical points ( and thus the maximiser ) of the functional @xmath95 ( with @xmath61 having a single critical point ) .",
    "we set up the variational principle as follows .",
    "let @xmath34 ( the `` direction '' of our variation ) be any @xmath63 vector field tangential to @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath96 be the flow ( in the dynamical systems sense ) given by @xmath97 given a stream function @xmath61 with a single critical point , we perturb it by composing it with the flow @xmath98 .",

    "so our aim is to prove that @xmath89 is not a critical point of @xmath105 unless @xmath3 is a disc ( assuming for now that @xmath89 has a single critical point ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the proof of this fact rests on obtaining an explicit equation for critical points of @xmath105 .",
    "we can now do this by a direct computation using the freidlin - wentzel theory  @xcite .",
    "[ ppncriticalpt]let @xmath108 be a bounded simply connected domain with a @xmath30 boundary and let @xmath68 be a @xmath63 stream function on @xmath3 with @xmath64 and a single critical point .",

    "one can also write down an explicit pde for the stream function @xmath61 .",
    "this pde , however , is somewhat more complicated , and we find it more convenient to work with   involving the reparametrization @xmath111 of @xmath61 .",
    "assume that a @xmath58 flow @xmath77 maximizes @xmath112 and @xmath78 has a single critical point .",
    "the argument following above then shows @xmath113 , so @xmath78 is a critical point of @xmath105 and solves .",
    "let now @xmath86 have a single critical point @xmath37 and assume that @xmath61 is a critical point of @xmath105 . recall that @xmath114 , so proposition  [ ppncriticalpt ] implies that @xmath61 solves  . since @xmath115",
    ", we obtain @xmath116 immediately showing that @xmath117 must be constant on the level sets of @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath61 solves the eikonal equation @xmath118 with @xmath119 equal zero at the maximum of @xmath61 and positive elsewhere .",
    "it is well known that a solution of such equation does not have interior singularities only if @xmath3 is a disk and @xmath61 is radial  @xcite . in our situation",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "after reparametrization we may assume that @xmath120 , and @xmath61 attains its maximum at @xmath121 .",
    "this introduces a singularity at @xmath121 so let us suppose that @xmath61 does not have other interior singularities . since the level sets of @xmath61 are connected , and the maximum is isolated , for any @xmath122 we can find a wavefront ( a level set of @xmath61 ) that is contained in a disc of radius @xmath122 centered at @xmath121 . by compactness , this wavefront is a positive distance @xmath123 away from @xmath121 .",
    "absence of singularities now implies that we can evolve this level set , and the spheres of radius @xmath124 and @xmath125 `` outward '' by the eikonal equation ( with @xmath126 ) . then each level set of @xmath61 obtained by this evolution lies entirely within distance @xmath127 from a circle . as @xmath122 is arbitrary",
    "we conclude that level sets of @xmath61 have to be circles .",
    "since @xmath128 , we have that @xmath3 is a disk and @xmath61 radial .",
    "thus we have proved that if @xmath89 has a single critical point , then it does not maximize @xmath105 when @xmath3 is not a disc .",
    "since the claim of theorem  [ thmworseonnondisk ] for a disc follows from theorem  [ t.1.1 ] ( which we will prove shortly ) , we are left with considering the case of @xmath3 such that @xmath89 has more than one critical point .",
    "we will use the following claim to reduce this to the previous case .    for",
    "any bounded simply connected @xmath108 with a @xmath30 boundary , the set of maxima of @xmath89 is discrete .",
    "let @xmath129 , let @xmath130 , and suppose @xmath131 is not discrete .",
    "since @xmath131 is positive distance from @xmath18 , it has an accumulation point @xmath121 inside @xmath3 .",
    "assume without loss of generality that a sequence @xmath132 converges to @xmath121 along the @xmath4-axis : @xmath133 .",
    "thus @xmath134 , so @xmath135 and the analytic implicit function theorem shows that there is a real analytic curve @xmath136 containing @xmath121 on which @xmath137 ( since @xmath89 is real analytic ) .",
    "it then follows that @xmath138 for all large @xmath139 , and real analyticity of @xmath140 now shows @xmath141 .",
    "so @xmath131 contains an analytic curve which can not end inside @xmath3 ( by the previous argument ) and must also stay away from @xmath32 ( by @xmath142 ) .",
    "this means that such a curve must be closed .",
    "but then @xmath143 inside the region enclosed by this curve ( which is a subset of @xmath3 ) , a contradiction .",
    "we now return to the proof of theorem  [ thmworseonnondisk ] for general @xmath89 and assume that the zero flow maximizes @xmath144 among all incompressible flows @xmath5 on @xmath3 .",
    "we will reduce the problem to the previous case by showing that then the same is true for a connected component of @xmath145 containing a maximum of @xmath89 , for all @xmath72 sufficiently close to @xmath146 .",
    "we introduce some notation and make this precise below .",
