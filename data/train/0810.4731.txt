    "the phenomena observed to date include multi - peaked probability distributions in bias current , rabi oscillations@xcite , ramsey fringes@xcite , spin - echo oscillations@xcite , and quantum tomography@xcite .",
    "in several recent investigations the authors of the present paper have contributed to an alternative interpretation of the basic types of experiments on josephson junctions .",
    "this interpretation relies on the well established phenomenology of the resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model @xcite and on nonlinear dynamics related to it .",
    "multi - peaked resonances were addressed in refs.[25 - 27 ] while references  [ 28,29 ] developed analytical expressions and presented computer simulations which described the relationships between classical rabi - type oscillations , driving amplitude and frequency , and systematic dissipation .",
    "the related phenomena of ramsey - fringes and spin - echo oscillations are depicted and described from a classical point of view in refs .  [ 30,31 ] .",
    "while this exemplifies the phenomena through current - biased single - junction circuits , we submit that a wide class of josephson systems exhibits same behavior when a system variable is trapped in a potential well jeff_thesis . this presentation will amplify this point .",
    "a few examples of multi - junction systems for which direct comparisons between classical theory and experimental results have been made in the low temperature regime , where quantum phenomena should be observed , include multi - peaked resonances in josephson interferometers , made of two junctions connected in parallel @xcite , and a more complex josephson interferometer - based device@xcite containing a double - squid , in which a butterfly catastrophe was observed at 10 mk . in both cases ,",
    "the standard classical rcsj model provided sufficient detail to understand the experimental observations .",
    "the observations from interferometer systems described in the last paragraph encouraged us @xcite to extend the classical ideas and implementations developed for the single junctions and two - junction interferometers to the more complex system of the flux - biased three - junction loop ilichev : rabi , kutsuzawa.takayanagi : ramsey , plourde.clarke : ramsey , mooij : qubit .",

    "our system is periodic under the application of the extrenal magnetic flux . in order to best describe the experimental reality the temperatures that we consider are in the tens of millikelvin range : we point out , however , that the kind of phenomena like those that we shall describe herein have been characterized in a temperature range spanning from few tens of mk up to 800 mk@xcite ; we believe that most of the phenomena herein described would display quite similar dependencies on temperature over the same range .",
    "to verify equation  ( [ eq : linresfreq ] ) , we conducted computer simulations of pulsed microwave spectroscopy for the three - junction loop described by equations ( [ eq : main ] ) ; naturally , the simulations are performed on the entire system of equations regardless of the analytical approximations .",
    "microwave spectroscopy , combined with thermal escape measurements has turned out to be a reliable tool for investing resonances[25 - 27 ] ; here we try to follow real experimental recipes@xcite ; we must bear in mind that for the thermal escape we simulate the whole system of eq.6 and that switches to voltage states are just detected across a parallel connection of two junctions which forces us to attribute a 50% equal probability of switching to the two junctions .",

    "the open circles indicate the simulation results and depict the minimum amplitude probe pulse @xmath61 for which the escape rate equals 50% .",

    "the minimum energy value in each well is marked with a boxed symbol to establish the correspondence with the potential energy plot .",
    "the dashed line indicates the symmetric relationship in linear resonance frequency ( about @xmath69 ) for a well placement convention which is opposite to that of the continuous curve : in other terms the continuous line we trace the resonance moving the lower energy well ( follow fig .",
    "2 ) from left to right while the dashed line would correspond to tracing the resonance moving the lower energy well from right to left .",
    "the data presented is based on 2500 - 7000 escape events ; the simulation results show close agreement with our theory although the agreement diminishes slightly for increasing values of @xmath29 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that as the flux bias is increased , the higher of the two wells becomes broader , allowing larger oscillations , which corresponds to a greater degree of anharmonic behavior .",
    "next we investigated whether the results obtained on the linear resonance frequency calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : linresfreq ] will generate features consistent with what one could expect from spectroscopic measurements on real josephson junction systems .",
    "thus we tuned the parameters of our simulations to generate rabi - type oscillations , ramsey - type fringes , and spin - echo - type oscillations@xcitejeff_thesis .",
    "the recipes for generating these oscillations follow closely the ones described in the previous publications for the single junction model and a summary of the signalling used for generating rabi - type oscillations , ramsey - type fringes , and spin - echo is shown in figure  4 together with the idealized phase responses in the two relevant cases of escape and no - escape from the potential well .",

    "4b of ref .",
    "[ 12 ] and with fig .",
    "4b of ref .",
    "we conclude that our numerical and analytical results are quite consistent with the experimental reality . as far as the ramsey - type fringes are concerned ,",
    "if we compare fig .",
    "5d in this presentation with the results reported in fig . 4d  of ref .",
    "[ 12 ] , we also find very good agreement in the ramsey - type fringe being represented by a unity - sloped v - shaped fringe frequency dependence on the microwave detuning from the oscillator resonance .",
    "we clearly see our v - shape following the dashed lines in fig .",
    "thus , just as it has been demonstrated for rabi oscillations , the classical system exhibits a signature similar , if not identical , to what one would expect from quantum theory .",
    "[ pt ]    fig5.eps    we note that our analytical approximations explain how the three - loop potential can be reduced to a single degree of freedom potential , however , it is clear from the results of the direct integration of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) shown in fig . 6 that the response of the loop is quite similar to that of a single junction @xcite .",
    "the classical result , leading to the ramsey fringe frequency being identical to the detuning between the applied microwave frequency @xmath4 and the intrinsic resonance @xmath70 of the oscillator , can be rationalized by considering the system behavior in the interval between the two @xmath71-pulses .",
    "the oscillator is , at the time of the conclusion of the first @xmath72-pulse , defined by a specific phase - relationship ( phase - locking ) to the phase of the @xmath73-pulse .",
    "this phase - relationship is free to detune in the ( ballistic ) interval @xmath74 between the two @xmath71-pulses , and the mutual phase detuning @xmath75 between the microwave field and the oscillator is therefore given by @xmath76where @xmath70 can be a ( weak ) function of time due to the anharmonicity of the potential energy ; i.e. , as the oscillation amplitude decreases , due to the intrinsic damping in the system , the natural resonance frequency of the oscillator increases .",
    "however , for a lightly damped system , where @xmath77 , the above time integration can be simplified , and the result for the ramsey fringe frequency @xmath78 becomes @xmath79which is exactly the detuning between the applied microwave frequency and the natural resonance frequency of the oscillator in the phase - locked state .",
    "thus , the observed ramsey fringe frequency dependence on the microwave detuning from resonance is easily understood classically for this system , and the intrinsic oscillator frequency @xmath80 is close to the microwave frequency that results in @xmath81 .",
    "we submit that this detuning is also causing the so - called spin - echo measurements , which are generated by maintaining a constant temporal separation between the two @xmath71-pulses from ramsey fringe measurements , and then inserting a @xmath73-pulse .",
    "the final phase - relationship between the oscillator and the external microwave signal is detected by the second @xmath72-pulse , but this phase - relationship is now subject to the phase - twisting caused by the inserted @xmath73-pulse , which in turn depends on the detuning at the time of @xmath73-pulse initiation .",
    "thus , while the rabi - frequency determines the magnitude and duration of the microwave pulses used in ramsey - fringe experiments , it is the ramsey - fringe frequency that determines the echo from the detuning at the time of the initiation of the @xmath73-pulse @xcite .",
    "[ pt ]    fig6.eps    in previous work , and here in fig .",
    "5b , we have considered rabi - type oscillations using the resonant frequency as the driving frequency : @xmath82 . however",
    ", this is not necessarily the case for all experiments . in fig .",
    "7 we show the effect of a lower - than - resonance ( @xmath83 ) driving signal on rabi - type frequency",
    ". one important aspect of these plots is that low - amplitude signals result in modulation frequencies which do not lie on the `` main sequence '' curve to which higher - amplitude responses conform .",
    "we assert that the reason for this is found in the multi - valued nature of the amplitude ( and energy ) response for off - resonant driving as shown in ref .",
    "[ 27 ] , fig .  1 .",
    "also notable is the fact that this effect ( an analytical result for the single junction ) is also seen in the three - junction loop .",
    "[ pt ]    fig7.eps",
    "the analysis we have developed reducing the three - junction loop to a single degree of freedom provides a significant reduction in the complexity of the system .",
    "the resulting equation provides direct agreement with our simulations when identifying the system resonances from experimentally relevant switching experiments .",
    "our studies of off - resonant driving of rabi - type oscillations reinforce earlier work concerning multi - valued functions in signal amplitude .",
    "although no distinct conclusions can be made with regard to a connection between off - resonant driving signals and linear relationships between rabi - type frequency and signal amplitude , we have shown evidence that driving the system near ( but not exactly at ) resonance does extract nearly linear behavior in the response for larger amplitudes .",
    "we emphasize that the simple model we are using may not completely account for all the details of the observed phenomena .",
    "consistently with our previous work , we have used the classical rcsj phenomenology to investigate various phenomena heretofore attributed to macroscopic quantum tunneling and  we have shown very good agreement with experimental results so far reported .",
    "we have shown that , with regard to rabi - type oscillations , ramsey - type fringes , and spin - echo - type oscillations , the three - junction loop differs little , qualitatively , from the single - junction circuit .",
    "this is easily attributed to the fact that the important dynamics of these systems is governed by resonant excitations in anharmonic potential wells followed by a read - out perturbation which makes the system escape from the well .",
    "thus , our developed analysis and intuition about the system response to applied microwave pulses translates easily from a simple single junction system to other systems with similar overall resonant excitations and escape from anharmonic wells .",
    "the main difference between the single junction system and other systems , such as the three loop system studied here , is that the experimental reality may be different .",
    "however , given the relative insensitivity to noise inherent in the three - junction loop , it is understandable that several research groups work with flux qubits rather than single junctions ( biased by dc bias current supplies ) .",
    "the work herein presented was developed on the background of the phd thesis@xcite of one of the authors ( jem ) which was submitted to the university of california at davis in the fall of 2006 . in the present paper we have chosen to keep the same terminolology ( rabi - type oscillations , ramsey - type fringes etc ) introduced in the thesis and in the papers which inspired it jensen : multi - peak_1,jensen : multi - peak_2,jensen : multi - peak_ljj , cirillo95 .",
    "other authors have recently reported on rcsj - based analysis of the three - junction josephson system presenting their own terms and analysisnori08 : in these papers , the pumping by an ac drive was used in order to generate low frequency modulations of phase and energy and the conclusions confirm a nonlinear phenomenon reported previously in simulations and experimentsjensen : multi - peak_1,jensen : multi - peak_2,jensen : multi - peak_ljj , cirillo95 , namely that it is possible to phase - lock josephson systems by superharmonic pumping .",
    "the quantum effects on the other hand should not be sensitive to the superharmonic drive and therefore this difference could constitute a discriminant between classical and quantum effects .",
    "two of us ( mc and ngj ) were co - authors in publications@xcite in which the superharmonic pumping of phase qubit was observed over a broad temperature range : we recall indeed that nonlinear rcsj dynamics can model a josephson system over broad parameter ranges and in particular at very low temperatures .",
    "recent observations @xcite indicate that this is indeed is the case down to 10mk where striking experimental observations of nonlinear effects are observed ; therefore it might not be easy to engineer a josephson system on which all the nonlinear effects are purged out .",
    "it is also worth noticing that it is not straightforward to draw conclusions from experiments with superharmonic pumping of a superconducting circuit due to the varying responses that both the system and the microwave apparatus may have at different frequencies .",
    "the possibility that the behavior of a physical system thought to demonstrate evidence of macroscopic quantum superposition can be interpreted with a different approach is not a unique characteristic the josephson effect .",
    "roughly three decades ago scientists were looking for macroscopic quantum effects in charge density - wave systems @xcite and it was found that the reported results could also be explained by alternative and more `` classical '' models @xcite .",
    "it was earlier speculated that these kind of arguments would not find space and motivation in josephson systems , but while our findings for resonant switching , rabi - oscillations , ramsey - fringes , and spin - echo do not preclude observations of quantum behavior in josephson systems , the evidence of recent years has shown that many observed phenomena in this class of systems can be attributed to the rcsj dynamics developed for josephson variables in a classical limitvanduzer.barone .",
