    "<S> @xcite the entanglement performs a fundamental resource for many protocols , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , and distributed quantum computation @xcite . in this context , entanglement swapping plays an important role in several protocols of quantum information transfer , in particular , it is arguably one of the most important ingredients for quantum repeaters and quantum relays @xcite , as well as in teleportation of entangled states . for the entanglement swapping protocol , two pairs of particles </S>",
    "<S> are usually used with each pair previously entangled , and a bell - state measurement made upon a particle of each pair leads the remaining particles to an entangled state , even if they have never interacted previously with each other .    due to the importance of entanglement swapping various experimental results have been presented recently @xcite . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors employed two pairs of polarized entangled photons and making a bell - state measurement upon the photon of each pair , they displayed an entanglement of freely propagating particles that have never interacted or dynamically coupled by any other means . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement swapping operations have been reported in @xcite via nuclear magnetic resonance quantum - information processing , over long distances in optical fibers @xcite , and unconditionally for continuous variables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement swapping for continuous - variable has been used to realize quantum teleportation beyond the no - cloning limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multistage entanglement swapping in photonic system @xcite , an ion - trap quantum processor through entanglement swapping @xcite , and the first experimental demonstration of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger entanglement swapping @xcite have also been reported .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , a lot of theoretical schemes have appeared in the recent literature @xcite generalizing the standard entanglement swapping for : multiparticle systems @xcite ; multi - qudit systems @xcite , where the authors have extended the scheme originally proposed for two pairs of qubits and an arbitrary number of systems composed by an arbitrary number of qudits ; d - level systems in a generalized cat state @xcite , useful for protocol of secret sharing . concerning with secret sharing in cavity qed @xcite , multiparty secret sharing of quantum information @xcite and classical information @xcite , secure multiparty quantum communication by bell states @xcite and by entangled qutrits @xcite based on entanglement swapping have also been proposed .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the list of entanglement swapping applications , the purification of entangled states by local actions , using a variant of entanglement swapping , was studied in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this issue was extended for continuous variables in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum key distribution schemes @xcite and teleportation of a two - particle entangled state @xcite employing entanglement swapping have been reported , as well as entanglement swapping without joint measurement @xcite . in the qed - cavity context , a scheme based on two atoms and two cavities initially prepared in two pairs of atom - photon nonmaximally entangled states , was considered in @xcite to create maximally entangled photon - photon and atom - photon states via entanglement swapping , with atomic states in either a three - level cascade or lambda configuration in @xcite , with resonant interaction of a two - mode cavity with a @xmath0-type three - level atom involving only a single measurement in @xcite and , in @xcite , an alternative scheme to implement the entanglement swapping . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , an entanglement swapping in the two - photon jaynes - cummings model was proposed in @xcite .    here , </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of the quantum regime of strong interactions between single atoms and photons present in a microtoroidal resonator @xcite , as employed in @xcite for quantum information processing , we propose an entanglement swapping of states of atoms confined in distant low qed cavities using photonic faraday rotations . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to make use of the faraday rotation produced by single - photon - pulse input and output process regarding low - q cavities @xcite . in view of our applications </S>",
    "<S> , we revisited the input - output relation for a cavity coherently interacting with a trapped two - level atom , recently considered in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a three - level atom interacting with a single mode of a low - q cavity pumped by photonic emission of a single photon source via optical fibers . </S>",

    "<S> [ f1 ] shows the atomic levels of the atom trapped inside the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> each transition is described by the jaynes - cummings model .    </S>",
    "<S> one can use the quantum langevin equation of the cavity mode @xmath1 driven by the corresponding cavity input operator @xmath2 and the atomic lowering operator are @xcite ,    @xmath3a(t)-g\\sigma _ { -}(t)-\\sqrt{\\kappa } a_{\\mathrm{in}}(t ) , \\label{eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath4\\sigma _ { -}(t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -&g\\sigma _ { z}(t)a(t)+\\sqrt{\\gamma } \\sigma _ { z}(t)b_{\\mathrm{in% } } ( t ) , \\label{eom2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively , where @xmath1 @xmath5 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity field with frequency @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are , respectively , inversion and raising ( lowering ) operators of the two - level atom with frequency difference @xmath10 between these two - levels . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the cavity damping rate and the atomic decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum input field @xmath13 felt by the two - level atom satisfies the commutation relation @xmath14=\\delta ( t - t^{\\prime } ) $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the input and output fields of the cavity are related by the intracavity field as @xmath15 @xcite .    in this way , considering a large enough @xmath16 to be sure that we have a weak excitation by the single - photon pulse on the atom initially prepared in the ground state , i.e. , keeping @xmath17 throughout our operation , as shown in @xcite one can adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode and arrive at the input - output relation of the cavity field,@xmath18[i(\\omega _ { 0}-\\omega _ { \\mathrm{p}})+\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}]+g^{2}}{% [ i(\\omega _ { c}-\\omega _ { \\mathrm{p}})+\\frac{\\kappa } { 2}][i(\\omega _ { 0}-\\omega _ { \\mathrm{p}})+\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}]+g^{2 } } ,   \\label{rela}\\]]where @xmath19 is the reflection coefficient of the atom - cavity system . </S>",
    "<S> now , considering the case of @xmath20 and an empty cavity we have @xcite @xmath21    according to @xcite the transitions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are due to the coupling to two degenerate cavity modes @xmath24 and @xmath25 with left ( ) and right ( ) circular polarization , respectively . for the atom initially prepared in @xmath26 , the only possible transition @xmath27 implies that only the circularly polarized single - photon pulse @xmath28 will work . </S>",
    "<S> hence eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rela ] ) leads the input pulse to the output one as @xmath29 with @xmath30 the corresponding phase shift being determined by the parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> note that an input circularly polarized single - photon pulse @xmath31 would only sense the empty cavity ; as a consequence the corresponding output governed by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ r0 ] ) is @xmath32 with @xmath33 a phase shift different from @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for an input linearly polarized photon pulse @xmath35 , the output pulse is @xmath36this also implies that the polarization direction of the reflected photon rotates an angle @xmath37 with respect to that of the input one , called faraday rotation @xcite . if the atom is initially prepared in @xmath38 , then only the @xmath39 circularly polarized photon could sense the atom , whereas the @xmath40 circularly polarized photon only interacts with the empty cavity . </S>",
    "<S> so we have , @xmath41 where the faraday rotation is @xmath42 .        </S>",
