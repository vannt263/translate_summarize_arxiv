    "in recent years the advent of deep wide - field sky surveys has heralded the discovery of a variety of new and unusual diffuse stellar systems in the local group .",
    "arguably the most significant of these are the ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) satellites of the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the existence of which may have important implications for the `` missing satellites '' problem of @xmath10cdm cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these objects have luminosities as low as @xmath11 , and , with characteristic radii commonly in the range @xmath12  pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , physical sizes that are substantially smaller than those of classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies and which in some cases approach the globular cluster ( gc ) regime .",
    "ufds have two key characteristics distinguishing them as galaxies .",
    "first , although analysis of their internal kinematics is fraught with complexity due to , for example , the presence of binary stars and the effects of external tidal forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radial velocity observations consistently imply mass - to - light ratios as high as a few thousand ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , their constituent stellar populations ( i ) are ancient , and very metal poor with @xmath13fe@xmath2h@xmath3 \\rangle\\la-2.2 $ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) frequently exhibit substantial internal dispersions in iron abundance of up to @xmath14 dex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( iii ) sometimes include extremely metal poor members with @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3<-3 $ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ufds apparently extend the metallicity - luminosity relation seen for classical milky way satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that they are not the stripped remnants of once - larger progenitors ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "a second recently - discovered class of diffuse stellar systems is that of the so - called `` extended clusters '' ( ecs ; * ? ? ?",
    "these provoked interest because the first luminous examples appeared isolated on the size - luminosity plane , encroaching upon the empty region separating gcs from dwarf galaxies .",
    "however subsequent work uncovered many fainter ecs in m31 @xcite and other local group galaxies @xcite , and these fill out a region on the plane with @xmath15 and @xmath16  pc that overlaps substantially with the most diffuse gcs seen in the milky way @xcite .",
    "along with refined structural measurements @xcite and resolved photometry precluding large internal spreads in @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 $ ] @xcite , this suggests that ecs most likely represent the upper tail of the globular cluster size distribution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it remains to be convincingly demonstrated kinematically that ecs need not contain any dark matter component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they nonetheless apparently stand clearly distinct from ufds despite their close proximity on the size - luminosity plane .",
    "m31 is an excellent location for studying a wide variety of stellar systems , as it possesses many more dwarf satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than does the milky way .",
    "recently we have conducted the _ pan - andromeda archaeological survey _ ( pandas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , imaging the m31 halo to a projected galactocentric distance of @xmath17  kpc with cfht / megacam and facilitating the first detailed characterization of this region and the star clusters and dwarf galaxies that inhabit it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing of our discoveries is pandas-48 ( pa-48 ) , at @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( j2000 ) , which we uncovered during our search for remote globular clusters in m31 ( huxor et al .",
    "2013 , in prep . ) .",
    "this is a very faint stellar system with @xmath20 lying at @xmath21  kpc .",
    "the pandas discovery images ( figure  [ f : images ] ) reveal a notably elongated object with a very diffuse structure . in this letter we present deep _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ follow - up imaging of pa-48 and show that , unusually , it possesses characteristics that do not allow it to be unambiguously classified as either an extended cluster or a faint dwarf galaxy .",
    "we observed pa-48 with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard _ hst _ on 2011 november 3 as part of program go 12515 ( pi : mackey ) .",
    "the object was imaged three times in both the f606w and f814w filters , with small dithers between exposures .",
    "integration times were @xmath22s for f606w frames and @xmath23s for f814w frames .",
    "we obtained the reduced data from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "the calacs pipeline now includes a pixel - based charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) correction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as improved corrections for effects introduced by the acs electronics . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ f : images ] we display the drizzled , cte - corrected f606w image of pa-48 .",
    "the object is fully resolved , and we confirm it as a faint , low surface brightness stellar system with an extended structure ; the apparently elongated morphology persists .",
    "we photometered our images using v2.0 of the dolphot photometry software @xcite .",
    "dolphot performs point - spread function ( psf ) fitting using model psfs especially tailored to the acs / wfc camera .",
    "the software provides a variety of photometric quality parameters for each detection .",
    "we selected those objects classified as stellar , with valid photometry in all six input images , a global sharpness parameter between @xmath24 in each filter , and a crowding parameter @xmath25 mag in each filter .",
    "our final photometry is on the calibrated vegamag scale of @xcite .",
    "we assessed the photometric uncertainties and detection completeness by performing artificial star tests . for each real star we randomly generated @xmath26 artificial stars of the same brightness but with positions uniformly distributed within a radius @xmath27 of its coordinates .",
    "dolphot adds a single artificial star at a time to the images and then attempts to measure it .",
    "we filtered the results according to the photometric quality parameters as described above , and for each real star ( i ) assigned a detection completeness by comparing the number of recovered objects with the number submitted ; and ( ii ) characterised the photometric uncertainties by examining the scatter in the differences between the input and measured magnitudes of the artificial stars .",
    "our @xmath28 completeness level is at @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where the uncertainties are typically @xmath24 mag in both filters .",
    "figure  [ f : cmds ] shows our color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for pa-48 . we observe a steep red giant branch ( rgb ) and a blue horizontal branch ( hb ) , characteristic of the ancient ( @xmath31  gyr old ) stellar populations seen in both gcs and low - luminosity dwarfs . at the top of the rgb",
    "there is the suggestion of a spread in color that is larger than the photometric uncertainties should allow ; we discuss this in more detail below .    to obtain a photometric metallicity estimate for pa-48 we aligned de - reddened globular cluster fiducials from @xcite , following the procedures described in @xcite",
    "briefly , we registered the fiducials using the observed level of the hb and the color of the rgb at the hb level .",
    "the metallicity sets the curvature of the upper rgb . because pa-48 is in the remote halo of m31",
    ", it may not lie at the same distance as the galaxy s center . for each fiducial we therefore tested distance moduli in a range @xmath32 mag about the usual @xmath33 for m31 .",
    "at given @xmath34 we calculated the foreground extinction necessary to align the hb levels of the cmd and the reference fiducial .",
    "this in turn allowed us to calculate the offset in color between the cmd and fiducial rgb sequences at the hb level .",
    "the best combination of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for a given fiducial was that which minimised this offset .",
    "we then examined how closely the shapes of the cmd and fiducial rgb sequences matched .        the most metal - poor cluster in the @xcite sample  m92 , with @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3\\approx-2.3 $ ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* update )  provides an excellent fit to the shape of the red side of the pa-48 rgb .",
    "this suggests that pa-48 is at least as metal - poor as m92 .",
    "the implied distance modulus and foreground reddening are @xmath4 and @xmath36 , where the uncertainties are calculated according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "our reddening estimate is in good agreement with that predicted by the @xcite maps , @xmath37 , while our distance modulus strongly suggests pa-48 is a member of the m31 system  it sits at @xmath38 kpc , implying a 3d galactocentric radius of @xmath5  kpc .",
    "the pa-48 hb does not extend bluewards as far as that of m92 .",
    "we measure a hb - index @xmath39 , which may indicate a mild second - parameter effect .",
    "the inset to figure  [ f : cmds ] highlights the fact that stars on the upper rgb of pa-48 span a range in color larger than would be expected if considering only the photometric uncertainties .",
    "the registered m92 fiducial suggests that this is driven predominantly by the bluest , and second brightest , of the three most luminous rgb stars ( hereafter star - b ) .",
    "given the potential importance of an rgb color spread , we consider several possibilities that might explain the observed position of star - b on the cmd :    _ 1 .",
    "non - member .",
    "_ local foreground contamination is moderate ",
    "we find @xmath40 stars further than @xmath41 from the pa-48 center that are at least as bright as its upper rgb ( @xmath42 ; figure  [ f : cmds ] ) .",
    "however , star - b lies well within the half - light radius of @xmath43 ( see below ) .",
    "the probability that a non - member should fall both within @xmath44 and close to the rgb is very small .",
    "the area within @xmath44 is @xmath45 of the wfc field - of - view , while the vicinity of the rgb is , generously , @xmath46 of the area of the cmd occupied by stars with @xmath42 . assuming field stars are uniformly distributed on the ccd and the cmd , the chance of one or more falling both within @xmath44 and close to the rgb from @xmath47 trials is just @xmath48 .",
    "hence it is very likely that star - b is a member of pa-48 .",
    "_ 2 . an internal dispersion in",
    "@xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 $ ] or age .",
    "_ in principle , an internal dispersion in @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 $ ] ought to translate into a color spread on the upper rgb , with star - b s blue @xmath49 magnitude indicating a lower abundance than for star - a and star - c .",
    "however , stellar evolution models generally indicate that at fixed luminosity the rgb temperature and , hence , broadband color will asymptote to a certain value with decreasing metallicity . to test the sensitivity of @xmath49 color at",
    "low @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 $ ] we use isochrones from the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite . in figure",
    "[ f : iso ] we plot models with @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3=-2.3 $ ]  and @xmath50 , and @xmath51fe@xmath3=+0.4 $ ] .",
    "there is a noticeable shift to the blue with decreasing abundance , but not sufficiently large to match star - b s color .",
    "we further computed dartmouth evolutionary tracks at @xmath52 and @xmath51fe@xmath3=+0.4 $ ] for @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3=-2.5 $ ] , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . on the upper rgb at a luminosity consistent with that of star - b these three models differ in f606w@xmath55f814w color by no more than @xmath56 mag .",
    "thus , under the assumption of constant @xmath51fe@xmath3 $ ] , it is unlikely that star - b s position on the cmd is due to it having a much lower @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 $ ] than the bulk of the other stars .",
    "however , the insensitivity of @xmath49 color to @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 $ ] at very low abundances also means that we can not rule out a moderate internal metallicity dispersion in general .",
    "a complicating factor is that our photometry does not reach the @xmath57 gyr main - sequence turn - off ; we can only exclude the presence of populations younger than @xmath58 gyr ( figure  [ f : iso ] ) . decreasing age at fixed composition moves the rgb to the blue ; @xmath59 gyr old stars might nearly match the position of star - b .",
    "mild chemical evolution with age could also be accommodated  as an example we plot a @xmath59 gyr model with @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3=-1.9 $ ] and @xmath51fe@xmath3=+0.2 $ ] .",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "_ the time a low - mass star spends ascending the agb ( i.e. , before the thermally - pulsating phase ) is @xmath60 of the time it spends in the core he - burning phase .",
    "thus we may expect to find roughly one agb star for every ten hb stars in the cmd .",
    "in pa-48 we observe @xmath61 hb stars , consistent with the possibility that star - b is an agb star .",
    "even so , this object is substantially bluer than all agb stars visible at comparable brightness in the well - populated cmds for metal - poor m31 ecs presented by @xcite , which tend to lie much closer to the rgb .",
    "it is hence difficult to conclusively assess the viability of this suggestion with only the presently - available data ; however , in our opinion it remains the most likely option .      to quantify the structure of pa-48 we utilised the maximum likelihood algorithm developed by @xcite to study low - luminosity stellar systems .",
    "this technique provides robust estimates and uncertainties for parameters such as the half - light radius and ellipticity of an object from resolved photometry .",
    "our results are displayed in figure  [ f : profile ] .",
    "the algorithm converges on a unique likelihood maximum , revealing that pa-48 is indeed a moderately elliptical extended object with @xmath8 and @xmath62  pc .",
    "the uncertainties represent @xmath63 confidence limits ; note there is an additional @xmath64  pc uncertaintiy in @xmath44 due to the error in our line - of - sight distance .",
    "huxor et al .",
    "( 2013 , in prep . )",
    "estimate @xmath20 for pa-48 from surface photometry of the discovery images . with our resolved measurements we are able to integrate to a larger radius and",
    "use a cmd filter to better remove contaminants .",
    "the completeness - corrected luminosity we obtain by adding all members down to @xmath65 and within @xmath66 of the center is @xmath67 .",
    "experimentation with population synthesis models suggests that for a @xcite mass function @xmath68 of the total luminosity of the system is included to our faint limit , implying @xmath69 . as per @xcite , uncertainties in the total luminosity for systems",
    "this faint are dominated by cmd shot noise at a level @xmath32  mag .",
    "pa-48 is an unusual m31 satellite that is not easily classified .",
    "structurally it is similar to the faint dwarf companions of the milky way as well as the ecs seen around some galaxies in the local group .",
    "intriguingly , however , a number of its other characteristics would make it an atypical example of either type of object . to illustrate this point , in figure  [ f : sizelum ] we plot a variety of stellar systems on the size - luminosity plane , color - coded by ellipticity .",
    "assessed purely in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath70 , pa-48 appears most akin to the lowest - luminosity local group ecs . although the faintest milky way ufds are of very similar size to pa-48 , dwarfs of comparable luminosity to pa-48 have scale radii typically @xmath71 times larger .",
    "that said , pa-48 appears substantially more elliptical than any galactic globular cluster measured to date , extended or otherwise , as well as almost all local group gcs for which reliable measurements are available ( figure  6 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , it lies comfortably within the range of ellipticities exhibited by faint dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , few of the low - luminosity diffuse milky way globular clusters have ellipticity measurements in the @xcite catalogue . to attempt a fairer comparison , we ran the @xcite software on our _ hst _  photometry of m31 ecs  three from @xcitehec4 due to heavy field contamination .",
    "] , and three from the present program , yet unpublished .",
    "these span luminosities @xmath72 and projected galactocentric radii @xmath73  kpc .",
    "our results are consistent with the assessment above .",
    "five of the six m31 ecs have @xmath74 with typical uncertainties of @xmath75 , while one ( pa-50 ) has @xmath76 , commensurate with the most highly flattened galactic gcs .",
    "if pa-48 is a cluster then it would also be among the most isolated such objects seen in the local group  just one gc of any kind ( mgc1 in m31 ) is known with a larger 3d radius .",
    "this appears at odds with its unusually high ellipticity .",
    "one might expect that a low - luminosity star cluster with high ellipticity is being tidally disturbed ; however we have strong evidence from mgc1 that tidal forces are exceedingly benign at such large galactocentric distances @xcite .",
    "it may be that pa-48 is on a highly eccentric orbit about m31 and so suffered a disruptive but non - fatal tidal shock some gyr ago .",
    "a radial velocity measurement and orbital modelling will be necessary to determine if this is a viable solution .    as noted above",
    ", if pa-48 is a low - luminosity dwarf then it is unusually small in terms of its spatial extent .",
    "comparable systems are observed ( willman 1 ; segue 1 & 2 ) but these are @xmath9  mag fainter than pa-48 .",
    "although the luminosities of such objects can fluctuate substantially with the evolution of their brightest few stars , it is very unlikely they could get as bright as pa-48 ( or vice versa , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , the distinction between these systems may not be as great as it appears on figure  [ f : sizelum ] .",
    "furthermore , only a handful of dwarf galaxies fainter than @xmath77 are known and it is easy to speculate that perhaps the size - luminosity plane is simply not yet sufficiently well sampled to accurately assess how unusual pa-48 would be in this regard . for dwarf galaxies with @xmath78 , where completeness is less of an issue , there is nearly an order of magnitude spread in @xmath44 at given luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a key alternative characteristic defining faint dwarfs is an internal spread in @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to constrain this possibility for pa-48 given its very metal - poor nature and our choice of broadband filters . @xcite have shown that ufds follow the same metallicity - luminosity relation as do the more massive galactic satellites ( their figure  3 ) .",
    "intriguingly , with @xmath79fe@xmath2h@xmath3\\rangle\\la-2.3 $ ] and @xmath80 , pa-48 fits closely with this relationship .",
    "if pa-48 is a dwarf galaxy then it would be the faintest known example outside the milky way",
    ". its isolation would reinforce the possibility that the faintest galactic ufds could well exist out to comparable distances , and not be shaped through their interactions with their host .",
    "finally , it is relevant that pa-48 lies within the thin plane of corotating m31 dwarf galaxies recently identified by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context , knowledge of its radial velocity would be helpful ",
    "if pa-48 is a true member of this plane of satellites ( pos ) then we expect its velocity to be more negative than the m31 systemic velocity .",
    "one might suspect that membership of the m31 pos would cement pa-48 s status as a dwarf galaxy , but this is not clear cut .",
    "we do not observe any evidence for m31 gcs being associated with the plane ; however , @xcite argue that outer halo milky way gcs _ are _ members of the galactic pos defined by , e.g. , @xcite .",
