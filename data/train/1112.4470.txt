    "one of the most debated issues in gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) concerns the existence of correlations among the spectral parameters of the prompt emission and its energetic and luminosity .",
    "three robust correlations have been identified .",
    "each of them involves the rest frame peak energy @xmath0  of the @xmath5 prompt spectrum .",
    "this quantity strongly correlates with ( i ) the isotropic energy @xmath1  ( amati relation , amati et al .",
    "2002 ) , ( ii ) the isotropic peak luminosity @xmath2   ( yonetoku relation , yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) and ( iii ) the collimation  corrected energy @xmath6 ( ghirlanda relation , ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004b ; see also liang & zhang 2005 ) .",
    "these correlations are valid for long grbs .",
    "there are indications that short bursts ( i.e. bursts with observed duration @xmath72 s ) obey the very same @xmath4  relation defined by long events but they are inconsistent with the @xmath3   correlation ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2009 ; amati 2010 ) .",
    "the spectral  energy correlations have relevant implications both for the theoretical understanding of the burst physics and for the application of grbs as cosmological tools ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004a ; ghirlanda et al . 2006 ) . while there is no consensus yet on the interpretation of these correlations ( e.g. eichler & levinson 2004 ; levinson & eichler 2005 ; rees & mszros 2005 ; thompson , mszros & rees 2007 ) , an interesting progress has been recently made by studying the comoving properties of grbs ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2012 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations have been discovered with a very small sample of 1216 grbs detected by _",
    "beppo_sax and/or batse ( amati et al . 2002 ; yonetoku et al . 2004 ) .",
    "they have been subsequently confirmed by adding bursts detected by other satellites ( e.g. _ hete ii _ , _",
    "konus_/wind , _ integral _ , _ swift _ and _ fermi _ ) . at present",
    "the sample of bursts defining the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations comprises more than 130 events , with only two well known ( very peculiar ) outliers ( but see ghisellini et al .",
    "2006 ) .    despite the considerably large number of bursts consistent with these correlations ,",
    "their physical origin is debated .",
    "some authors claim that they are the result of instrumental selection effects ( nakar & piran 2005 ; band & preece 2005 ; butler et al . 2007 ; shahmoradi & nemiroff 2011 ) .",
    "other studies ( ghirlanda et al . 2008 ; nava et al .",
    "2008 ) quantified the possible instrumental selection biases finding that , even if they do affect the sample , they can not be responsible for the existence of the spectral  energy correlations .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2010 ; 2011a ; 2011b ) added an important piece of information to this debate .",
    "they analysed the time ",
    "resolved spectra of both long and short bursts detected by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite .",
    "they found that the time ",
    "resolved @xmath0  correlates with the luminosity during the temporal evolution of the burst ( and for bursts without @xmath8 they derive a correlation between the time  resolved @xmath9  and the flux ) .",
    "this is a feature common to short and long grbs .",
    "the time  resolved correlations found within individual grbs are similar to each other and they are similar to the @xmath4  relation defined by the time  integrated spectral properties of different bursts ( i.e. the yonetoku relation ) .",
    "this is a strong argument in favour of the physical origin of the correlations because it is very unlikely that within a single burst the instrumental selection effects ( e.g. the detector threshold ) or possible effects related to the dependence of the peak energy , energetic and luminosity on the redshift can play any role .",
    "grbs added to the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations need to have their redshifts measured .",
    "this raised the suspect that these correlations might be biased by the high level of incompleteness in redshift of the samples of grbs so far used . in this paper",
    "we study , for the first time , the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations with a sample of grbs with a high level of completeness ( 90% ) .",
    "the sample is presented by salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and it comprises 58 events detected by _",
    "swift _ with a 1s peak photon flux @xmath10 ph s@xmath11@xmath12 ( integrated in the 15150 kev energy range ) .",
    "fifty  two out of 58 grbs have measured redshift @xmath8 , while in 3 cases an upper limit on @xmath8 can be set from the photometry of the afterglow or of the host galaxy .",
    "the completeness level then increases up to @xmath1395% by considering the redshift constraints imposed by the detection of the afterglow or host galaxy in some optical filters .",
    "the complete sample used in this work is particularly appropriate to study the possible evolution of the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations with redshift .",
    "li ( 2007 ) , considered a sample of 48 grbs ( from amati 2006 , 2007 ) and investigated if the @xmath3  correlation evolves with redshift , finding that it does , becoming steeper at higher redshifts .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2008 ) repeated the same test with a larger sample of 76 bursts and found no evidence of evolution with redshift .",
    "these results , however , were obtained by considering highly incomplete grb samples .",
    "our goals are ( i ) to study how @xmath0  is correlated to @xmath1  and @xmath2  within the complete sample of bursts and ( ii ) to study the possible evolution of these correlations with redshift through this unbiased sample . in @xmath142",
    "we present the spectral properties of the grbs composing the complete sample .",
    "we study the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations defined by this sample in @xmath15 and compare their properties with those defined by the ( incomplete ) larger sample of grbs with measured @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in @xmath16",
    "we discuss and summarise our conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a standard cosmology with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in order to study a relatively unbiased redshift distribution of grbs , jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) carefully selected a sample containing bursts which have ` observing conditions ' favourable for redshift determination ( see their web pagepja / grbsample.html ] for an updated compilation of the sample and an explanation of the selection criteria ) .",
    "this relatively ` clean ' sample has a redshift recovery rate of roughly 50% . in order to reach a higher level of completeness , salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2012 ) considered this sample and also required that the photon peak flux , measured by _",
    "swift_/bat in the 15150 kev energy band , is @xmath10 ph s@xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "up to may 2011 , 58 grbs match this selection criteria and are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "fifty - two of them have measured redshift so that our completeness level is 90% . of these 52 ,",
    "all but two ( namely grb 070521 and grb 080602 ) have spectroscopic confirmed redshift either from absorption lines over - imposed on the grb optical afterglow or from emission lines of the grb host galaxy .",
    "moreover , for 3 of the 6 bursts lacking measured @xmath8 the afterglow or the host galaxy have been detected in at least one optical filter , so that @xmath1395% of the bursts in this sample have a constrained redshift . while this sample represents only @xmath1310% of the full swift sample , it contains more than 30% of long grbs with known redshift .",
    "the bursts belonging to this sample ( updated to may 2011 ) are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we will refer to this sample as the ` complete ' one .    for all bursts in this sample , we collected from the literature the prompt emission spectral parameters and computed the rest frame peak energy @xmath0=@xmath9@xmath19 , the isotropic energy @xmath1  and the isotropic peak luminosity @xmath2 .",
    "the two latter quantities have been calculated in the rest frame energy range 1 kev10 mev .",
    "the narrow sensitivity range of the bat instrument allows to determine @xmath9  only when it falls approximately between @xmath20 kev and @xmath13150 kev .",
    "this condition is necessary but not sufficient : as demonstrated in the spectral simulation studies by sakamoto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , even when @xmath9  lies in the bat energy range , the value of @xmath9  can be determined only if the spectrum is characterized by a high signal - to - noise .",
    "similar conclusions were reached through numerical simulations by ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and nava et al .",
    "almost all grbs of the complete sample , however , have been detected also by other instruments with wider sensitivity ranges ( mainly _ konus_/wind and , for bursts after august 2008 , _ fermi _ ) .",
    "this allowed to estimate @xmath9  for a large fraction of events .",
    "we , therefore , obtained a sample of 46 bursts ( out of 58 ) with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2  and redshift @xmath8 , which are the quantities required to investigate the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations . for 6 grbs",
    "there is a good knowledge of the prompt spectral shape ( i.e. @xmath0  is well constrained ) , but the redshift is unknown ( in 3 cases it is possible to derive an upper limit on @xmath8 from the photometry of the afterglow or of the host galaxy ) . for the remaining 6 bursts the determination of @xmath9  is not possible : in 3 cases the spectrum",
    "is well described by a single power ",
    "law , while in the other 3 cases it is possible to set a lower limit to the observed value of @xmath9 . redshifts and spectral properties of the 58 grbs of the complete sample are reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "here we also report the spectral parameters of the prompt emission spectrum ( with their uncertainties ) and the fluence and peak flux ( with the energy ranges over which they are computed ) .",
    "these are the informations used to compute the rest frame isotropic energy and luminosities of the bursts in our samples .",
    "we also report for each burst the instrument used to derive the spectral parameters listed in the table . to summarize ,",
    "our sample is composed as follows :    * 46 grbs have measured @xmath8 and @xmath0  ( and consequently @xmath1  and @xmath2 ) ; * 3 grbs have measured @xmath0  but only an upper limit on @xmath8 ; * 3 grbs have measured @xmath0  but no redshift estimate ; * 3 grbs have measured @xmath8 but only a lower limit on @xmath9 ; * 3 grbs have measured @xmath8 but no @xmath9  estimate ;    it is interesting to compare the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations defined by the complete sample with the same correlations defined with a larger sample of grbs , comprising all bursts with measured redshifts and @xmath9   detected by different satellites .",
    "we updated also this sample ( called in the following the ` total ' sample ) to may 2011 .",
    "the total sample contains 136 bursts , for one of which the peak luminosity can not be derived , due to the lack of measured peak flux . for grbs detected by the gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm  meegan et al .",
    "2009 ) onboard _ fermi _ after march 2010 we retrieved the public data from the online catalog and we analysed their time ",
    "integrated spectra following the standard procedure described in nava et al .",
    "( 2011a ) .",
    "this sample is based on the one presented in ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to which we added four bursts ( grb 060306 , grb 061021 , grb 081007 , grb 081221 belonging also to the complete sample - see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we can thus compare the spectral  energy correlations defined by the complete and by the total samples . to point out possible differences we also consider the sample obtained from the total one by excluding the bursts of the complete sample ( we will refer to it as the ` complementary ' sample ) .",
    "we first test the @xmath3  and the @xmath4  correlations with the sample of 46 bursts ( included in the complete sample ) with firm estimates of the redshift and of the spectral properties .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "data points from the total sample are plotted for comparison as grey dots .",
    "red squares show the bursts of the complete sample .",
    "we estimate the spearman s rank correlation coefficient and the associated chance probability for the complete , total and complementary sample and report these numbers in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we model the distribution of the data points in the logarithmic plane of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with a linear function .",
    "we applied the ordinary least squares bisector method ( isobe et al .",
    "1990 ) for fitting the data .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that a priori there is no reason to assume either @xmath0  or @xmath1  ( or @xmath2 ) as the independent variable , and also by the large scatter of the data points . the errors on the slope and normalization are determined by fitting in the barycenter of data points , where they are uncorrelated .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the best fit lines are shown for each sample as follows : a solid black line for the total sample , a dashed red line for the complete sample and a dot  dashed black line for the complementary sample . the shaded region marks the 3@xmath21 of the scatter distribution of the data points around the best fit line for the total sample .",
    "the scatter estimated for the other two samples is also listed in table [ tab2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we also report the position of grb 980425 and grb 031203 ( blue filled stars ) , which are well known outliers of both the @xmath3  and the @xmath4  correlation .",
    "these two bursts have peculiar properties and they are generally considered as outliers to the confirmed relations .",
    "the behaviour of grb 061021 is very peculiar , since it lies at more than the 3@xmath21 from the amati and yonetoku correlations ( considering the scatter defined by the total sample  shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "twelve events belonging to the complete sample can not be directly used to test the correlations , since they have some unknown property : the redshift or the spectral peak energy ( see sec .",
    "2 ) . however",
    ", we can still test their consistency with the correlations ( results are shown in fig . [ fig2 ] ) . to check the consistency different methods",
    "are adopted for the following different cases :    * lower limit on @xmath9  and secure estimate of @xmath8 ( 3 cases ) : we derive the lower limit on the rest frame peak energy and on @xmath1  and @xmath2  ( right and up arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ; * no estimate of @xmath9  and secure estimate of @xmath8 ( 3 cases ) : we consider the energy range of sensitivity of the instrument and the photon index of the power ",
    "photon indices greater ( lower ) than 2 [ in the notation @xmath22 suggest peak energies greater ( lower ) than the upper ( bottom ) energy edge of the instrument . an upper or lower limit to @xmath0  ( and consequently on @xmath1  and @xmath2 )",
    "can be set ( empty triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ; * spectral properties well constrained but upper limit on @xmath8 ( 3 cases ) : @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath2  are estimated for a variable redshift ranging from 0.01 to its upper limit ( coloured continuous curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ; * spectral properties well constrained but no redshift estimate ( 3 cases ) : @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath2  are estimated for values of the redshift ranging from 0.01 to 10 ( coloured continuous curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the possibility that evolutionary effects play a role in the spectral  energy correlations still represents an open issue . to investigate if the slopes of the @xmath3  and @xmath4  correlations have a dependence on the redshift we repeat the same method used by li ( 2007 ) and ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and apply it to our complete sample .",
    "we exclude from the fit the burst which lies at more than 3@xmath21 of the amati and yonetoku relations .",
    "we define 4 sub  samples , with almost the same number of bursts , divided as follows : ( i ) @xmath23 ( 10 events , yellow empty circles in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , ( ii ) @xmath24 ( 11 events , filled purple stars ) , ( iii ) @xmath25 ( 12 events , filled green triangles ) and ( iv ) @xmath26 ( 12 events , empty red squares ) .",
    "bursts belonging to the total sample are not used for this test , since we want to take advantage of the completeness of our sample .",
    "the best fit slope of each sub  sample is reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , both for the amati ( left panel ) and yonetoku ( right panel ) correlation .",
    "the light blue horizontal stripe , shown in the inset , represents the two ",
    "sided 1@xmath21 interval of the slope derived by considering the whole complete sample and by excluding ( for consistency ) the two outliers .",
    "there is no evidence of a systematic evolution of the slope with @xmath8 .",
    "the slopes defined by individual bins of redshift are all consistent , within 1@xmath21 , with the slope defined by the entire complete sample . this result does not change by choosing a different number of bins .    bursts with the highest redshifts populate only the high  energy ( and high  luminosity ) region of the amati and yonetoku",
    "this is due to the fact that we selected relatively bright bursts , by requiring a minimum peak flux .",
    "the effect of this selection can be investigated as follows .",
    "we consider a series of spectra characterised by typical values @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we impose that the photon peak flux in the 15150 kev energy range is equal to our limiting flux ( @xmath29 ph s@xmath11@xmath12 ) . for different values of @xmath9",
    "we derive the corresponding limiting luminosity by considering two cases : ( i ) @xmath30 ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and ( ii ) @xmath31 ( dot  dashed curve ) .",
    "we consider these redshifts since they are representative of the two sub ",
    "samples at higher redshifts , which populate only the high  energy ( and high  luminosity ) part of the planes . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is clear that this effect is due to the use of a flux limited sample .    we may wonder if these limiting luminosities derived at different redshifts may affect our study on the redshift evolution .",
    "we identify two possible effects : at high redshift the range of available luminosities is smaller , i.e. the reduced leverage in luminosity might harden the estimate of the correlation slope and enlarge the associated uncertainty .",
    "moreover , since the introduced cutoff is nearly vertical in the @xmath0@xmath2  plane , we expect a possible steepening of the slopes toward high redshift .",
    "this effect has been investigated also by li ( 2007 ) . by performing simulations",
    ", he concludes that a spurious evolution of the slope with the redshift can be introduced , with high - redshift bins defining steeper relations .",
    "we do not find signs of this effect in our data ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , indicating that , even if at high redshift we are missing low - luminosity events , we are still able to recover the slope of the correlations which are consistent with those derived with low  z bins .    4.5pt    @lcccccccccccl@ grb & @xmath8 & @xmath32 [ @xmath33 & fluence & range & peak flux & range & mission & @xmath0  & @xmath1  & @xmath2   & ref .",

    "it might well be that the scatter is still not fully known and/or that it is not gaussian .",
    "the latter possibility seems to be suggested also by the log  normal distribution of the jet opening angles ( ghirlanda et al . 2005 ) if the source of the scatter of the @xmath3  correlation were , indeed , the jet opening angle .",
    "there are 12 bursts belonging to the complete sample that can not be used to directly test the correlations , due to the lack of measured redshift and/or @xmath9 .",
    "however , we can still check their consistency with the correlations ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we find that they are all consistent with both correlations .    by taking advantage of our complete sample , for both correlations",
    "we investigate the possible evolution with the redshift of the best fit slopes ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . to this aim",
    "we define 4 bins of redshift , chosen in order to have 4 sub ",
    "samples characterized by a similar number of objects .",
    "we find no relation between the slope of each sub  sample and the redshift .",
    "all slopes are consistent with the one defined by the whole complete sample and this is true both for the @xmath3  and the @xmath4  correlation .",
    "we also investigate possible differences ( in terms of distributions of the most fundamental quantities ) between bursts belonging to the complete sample and bursts that do not satisfy the complete sample selection criteria .",
    "our aim is to understand if the different instrumental biases present in the total sample affect in some way the distributions of the prompt emission properties .",
    "we find that for all the considered quantities ( @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath2 ) the distributions derived from the complete and from the complementary samples are consistent within 2@xmath21 .",
    "our results give support to the idea that spectral energy correlations arise because of a robust physical mechanism common to the vast majority of bursts .",
    "outliers exist , but they are a few .",
    "furthermore , the evidence that grbs do evolve in redshift ( salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ) , while there is no sign of evolution of the slopes of the correlations , also suggests that the spectral peak energy is closely linked to the luminosity / energetics of the burst , another sign that selection effects are not important .",
    "we thank the referee for comments that improved the manuscript . this work has been supported by asi grant i/004/11/0 and asi grant i/088/06/0 .",
    "this research has made use of the public fermi / gbm data and software obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
