    "the ads / cft correspondence is a powerful method to investigate the strongly coupled many body phenomena by relating certain interacting quantum field theories to classical gravity systems .",
    "an interesting application of such duality is the study of condensed matter physics from the remarkable connection in gravitational physics , for reviews see for examples @xcite .    stimulated by the ads / cft correspondence , the simplest realization to construct gravitational duals of the transition from normal state to superconducting state is to deal with einstein s gravitational theory with a negative cosmological constant coupled to a gauge field",
    "this idea caught some interesting properties of the realistic superconductor by discussing holography in the simplest charged ads black hole background .",
    "however , the rn - ads black hole contains nonzero entropy even at zero temperature .",
    "this situation was improved by changing the background bulk geometry to include a real scalar field , the dilaton , which allows zero entropy at zero temperature @xcite . at zero temperature",
    ", it was argued that states of matter can be holographically described by a spacetime with an asymptotically @xmath0 einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory , the quantum phase transitions between different phases were exhibited @xcite .",
    "more holographic properties disclosed in the dilaton black holes can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition to modifying the bulk gravitational backgrounds , recently there have been some attempts to modify the boundary conditions in describing the condensed matter system . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that one can implement the holographic non - relativistic fermionic fixed points by imposing lorentz breaking boundary conditions instead of the lorentz covariant one on the dirac spinor field , which can lead to the presence of an infinite flat band in the boundary field theory .",
    "further studies on the holographic non - relativistic fermionic fixed points have been reported in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the holographic non - relativistic fermionic fixed points were studied in the charged dilatonic black hole and black brane .    to capture more general features and phenomena relating to condensed matter physics , there have been a lot of investigations to consider a quantum field theory which contains fermions charged under a global u(1 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , many of these studies concentrated on the fermions minimally coupled to gravity and gauge fields . recently , introducing the coupling between the fermion and gauge field through a dipole interaction in the bulk charged ads black hole background , it was remarkably found that as the strength of the interaction is varied , spectral density is transferred and beyond the critical interaction strength a gap opens up@xcite . the existence of fermi surfaces as the varying of the dipole coupling was also disclosed@xcite .",
    "the extensions of the investigation on the dipole coupling to different bulk backgrounds were reported in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will extend the study of the dipole interaction to the charged dilatonic ads black hole background .",
    "considering that different from the charged ads black hole , the charged dilatonic ads black hole has vanishing entropy in the low temperature limit , it is a suitable bulk background to study the holographic fermi liquid .",
    "furthermore , the dilaton can couple directly not only to the gauge field but also to the charged scalar , which can help to further disclose the role played by the dipole coupling in the boundary theory of fermi liquid . in our study , instead of keeping lorentz invariance for the boundary theory , we will impose lorentz violating boundary terms for a spinor field following @xcite .",
    "we will investigate the holographic spectral function behaviors at the non - relativistic fermionic fixed points and compare with the situations at the relativistic fermonic fixed point@xcite .",
    "we will disclose how the effects of dilaton , the dipole coupling as well as the fermion charge modify the properties of fermi gap , fermi momentum etc . in the fermi system .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will derive the bulk dirac equations in 4-dimensional charged dilatonic ads black hole .",
    "then we will briefly discuss the holographic calculations of the retarded green functions of those fermionic operators for non - relativistic theory . in section iii",
    ", we will present our numerical results for the non - relativistic fixed point in different cases .",
    "finally , we will summarize our results in the last section .",
    "in this section , we will derive the dirac equations of the bulk fermion coupling to the gauge field through dipole interaction in the charged dilatonic ads black hole background .",
    "we will employ the lorentz violating boundary term for the spinor field and study the holographic fermionic systems through the perturbations on the non - relativistic fermionic fixed point .",
    "we consider the non - minimal coupling between the spin-1/2 fermions and the gauge field in the form of the dipole interaction described by the bulk action @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the mass of the fermion field and the dipole coupling parameter , respectively . in the action ,",

    "it is convenient to express @xmath26 into @xmath27 and choose the following basis for our gamma matrices@xcite @xmath28 the dirac equation can be rewritten into @xmath29 furthermore , to decouple the equation of motion , we take the decomposition @xmath30 with @xmath31 under such decomposition , the dirac equation ( [ diracef ] ) can be divided into @xmath32 @xmath33    it is straightforward to reduce the above two equations into the flow equation of @xmath34 @xmath35 + \\left [ v_{+ } - ( -1)^{i } k e^{-b }   \\right]\\xi_{i}^{2}~\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36\\pm p a_t^{'}$ ] .    near the ads boundary , from ( [ diracef ] )",
    "we see that the reduced dirac field behaves as @xmath37 then the value @xmath38 can be expressed in the form @xmath39 thus , we can read off @xmath40 by solving the flow equation ( [ diracef1 ] ) with the boundary conditions at the horizon@xcite @xmath41    it is worth indicating that from the flow equation ( [ diracef1 ] ) and the above boundary conditions , we can find @xmath40 with the following symmetries : @xmath42 especially , when @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 satisfy the relation @xmath46      most available works on the holographic fermionic systems focus on the perturbations on the relativistic fixed point by keeping the lorentz invariance for the boundary theory .",
    "in @xcite , the authors first considered the boundary term by dropping the lorentz invariance while still keeping the @xmath16 global symmetry @xmath47 , the rotational invariance as well as the scale invariance . in this spirit , the boundary term to the bulk action ( [ actionspinor ] ) reads @xmath48 this boundary term keeps the variational principle well - defined .    the variation of the on - shell action for the dirac spinor has the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we can extract two groups of fermionic source and the dual operator , which are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "we numerically integrate the flow equation ( [ diracef1 ] ) and read off the asymptotic values to compute the retarded green functions with the lorentz violating boundary term in the charged dilatonic ads black hole background .",
    "we will calculate the fermion spectral function and also the density of states .",
    "we will investigate the effects of the dipole coupling , the fermion charge and the dilaton field on the holographic fermionic system .      in this subsection",
    ", we will show our numerical results of the massless fermion in the limit of zero temperature . for convenience , we fix @xmath61 .",
    "the chemical potential reads @xmath62 .",
    "we choose @xmath63 in this subsection . in our computation",

    "clearly , we see that @xmath69 shows the flat band with the peculiar property of poles distributing continuously at a finite interval of momenta .",
    "this finite band is mildly dispersed at low momentum , but it presents strong peak at high momentum .",
    "this is because the high momentum modes sit outside the lightcone and ca nt decay .",
    "the peak tends sharper as can be checked by plotting a suitable cross section at fixed high @xmath70 .",
    "we now turn on the dipole coupling parameter @xmath3 and report the results in figs.[p2]-[p8 ] . at low momentum ,",
    "the flat band gets more dispersed and the band recovers flatness at higher momentum when the non - minimum fermion coupling becomes stronger . with the increase of the dipole coupling ,",
    "the frequency of the flat band is larger and the peak of the flat band becomes sharper at small momenta , which means that more energy is needed to excite the small momentum modes for larger @xmath3 .",
    "a finite gap opens up and enlarges when the dipole coupling becomes strong .",
    "the dipole coupling @xmath3 drives the dynamical formation of a gap , which mimics the role of interaction strength @xmath71 in the hubbard model , where the mott gap forms once @xmath71 exceeds a critical value . the further extreme behavior of the flat band shows the physics approaching a more strongly coupled corner when the dipole coupling becomes stronger .",
    "furthermore we observe that at large enough momentum the flat band always shifts to @xmath72 for all dipole coupling .",
    "this is because the frequency @xmath73 is measured relative to the chemical potential .",
    "the flat band corresponds to some zero modes in the minkowski vaccum , with the vanishing absolute energy of fermion characterized by @xmath74 in the dirac equation ( [ diraceinfourier ] ) on the boundary . from ( [ blackhole])([tmu ] ) , it is clear that @xmath75 at the boundary so that the frequency @xmath73 relates to the chemical potential at the boundary , which is independent of the dipole coupling .",
    "the appearance of the flat band for the non - relativistic fermions observed here is interesting , which has not been observed for the relativistic fermions in the charged dilatonic ads black hole background @xcite .",
    "the different properties between the non - relativistic and relativistic fermions observed here support the findings in @xcite by comparing with @xcite for the charged ads black hole background .     at @xmath76 for different dipole coupling .",

    ".the fermi momentum and fermi velocity for different dipole couplings when we choose @xmath64 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for different values of @xmath79 at zero temperature . ]",
    "now we will turn to investigate how the dilaton field influence the behavior of the spectral function . without loss of generality , we set @xmath80 in the discussion .",
    "when the dilaton field vanishes @xmath81 , the background ( [ blackhole ] ) goes back to the ads schwarzschild black hole . the spectral function for @xmath81",
    "is shown in fig.[figq1q0p ] .",
    "this background is not charged , so that it does not have fermi - like peak .    in the dilaton gravity ,",
    "the chemical potential is finite as described in ( [ tmu ] ) .",
    "this gives the possibility of fermionic excitation .",
    "the numerical results on the spectral function for nonzero values of @xmath79 are shown in fig.[densitydiffq ] .",
    "we observe the fermi - like peak and present the fermi momentum in table.[tablekfp2 ] .",
    "the fermi momentum increases but the peak becomes lower as the increase of the dilaton field @xmath79 . for larger @xmath79 , the flat band gets more dispersed in the low momentum and the peak of the band appears at higher momentum .",
    "this shows that the dilaton field has the effect on the shift of the flat band .    to see clearly the effect of the dilaton field on the gap , we plot the density of state by integrating @xmath69 over @xmath70 with strong dipole coupling @xmath82 in fig.[a - q ] .",
    "we observe that with the increase of @xmath79 , the gap becomes wider .",
    "this tells us that in the dilaton gravity the effect of the dipole coupling will be more explicit .     as a function of @xmath73 when @xmath63 at finite temperatures .",

    "it is of interest to examine this property for the non - relativistic situation by imposing lorentz breaking boundary conditions .",
    "we calculate the spectral function at the finite temperature .",
    "we set @xmath90 and @xmath82 in the following discussion . in the left panel of fig.[a - t1 ] , we show the density of state for different temperatures when the dilaton @xmath63 .",
    "we see that the gap becomes narrower and closes up when @xmath83 increases to the value @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , we show the width of the gap @xmath92 as a function of @xmath93 in the right panel of fig.[a - t1 ] . as the temperature increases to @xmath94 when the gap closes up",
    ", there is a transition from the insulator to conducting state . in our model",
    ", we find the ratio @xmath95 is around @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the width of the gap at zero temperature .",
    "this supports that the generated gap is temperature - dependent .",
    "we also calculate the spectral function for different dilaton charge , for example taking @xmath87 .",
    "the density of state for different temperature is shown in fig.[a - t2 ] .",
    "the property that gap becoming narrower for higher temperature holds as well . for bigger dilaton charge",
    ", we find that the value of @xmath95 is higher , where @xmath94 is the temperature to close up the gap . when @xmath87 , the value of @xmath95 is around @xmath98 .",
    "this ratio increases with the dilaton charge .",
    "note that in the charged ads black hole background , the ratio @xmath95 was found around @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that similar to the case of zero temperature , the gap becomes wider as we increase @xmath79 for fixed finite temperature , this is explicit by comparing fig.[a - t1 ] and fig.[a - t2 ] .",
    "in this paper , we have studied extensively the properties of the holographic non - relativistic fermionic spectral function in the presence of a bulk dipole coupling in the charged dilatonic black hole background .",
    "we generalized previous related studies @xcite by combining non - relativistic fermions , dipole coupling and a dilaton field and studied how all these ingredients affect together the properties of this fermionic system .",
    "firstly , we have further confirmed that the emergence of flat band is robust in the case of non - relativistic fermionic fixed point , independent of the black hole background and the coupling between the fermions and gauge field .",
    "secondly , we observed that the fermi momentum increases as the dipole coupling becomes stronger for some specific charge @xmath100 and small @xmath3 . by studying the dispersion relation for small @xmath3",
    ", we found that this fermionic system had the linear dispersion relation for these specific charge @xmath100 and @xmath3 .",
    "then , by studying the large dipole coupling effects , we found that for a fixed @xmath100 , the fermi sea disappeares and a gap opens up when the dipole coupling goes beyond a critical value , which indicated this fermionic system possesses the characteristic of the mott insulator .",
    "our calculations also showed to us that bigger charge make the gap opens easier .",
    "subsequently , we also investigated how the dilaton field influence the behavior of the spectral function .",
    "the results showed that the effect of the dipole coupling is more explicit in the dilaton gravity .",
    "finally , we found that this holographic non - relativistic fermionic system with dipole coupling also exhibits a phase transition from insulator to a conducting state as the temperature is increased .",
    "it implied that the gap emerged by the dipole coupling in this dilaton background possesses non - trivial temperature dynamics .",
    "the properties for the nonrelativistic fermion system disclosed here in the holographic study with the modification of the boundary term are interesting .",
    "it is of interest to further explore the holographic properties of the nonrelativistic fermion system , for example the backreaction of the bulk fermion on the background , the nature of the fermi surface and its relation to the phase transition etc . besides",
    ", it will be interesting to examine whether the model satisfies the luttinger s theorem@xcite .",
    "it is expected that the theoretical attempts in this direction can help to unlock more puzzles in the condense matter physics .",
