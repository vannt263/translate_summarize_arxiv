    "very recently the cdf collaboration has reported evidence for a top quark of mass @xmath6 in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the leading - order production processes are @xmath2 , and a statistically significant signal is seen in the channels @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . from the latter sample ,",
    "the top mass is reconstructed from the final - state lepton and jet momenta . a potential problem with this procedure",
    "arises when the final state contains an additional hadronic jet , since it is not known _ a priori _ whether this jet arises from initial - state radiation , in which case it should be ignored , or whether it originated ( say ) in bremsstrahlung off a @xmath4 quark , in which case it should be included in the @xmath3 reconstruction .",
    "we note that a substantial fraction of the candidate top events reported by cdf do indeed have an additional jet over and above the number associated with the leading - order production and decay process .",
    "in fact there is _ no _ meaningful separation of such jets into ` initial- ' and ` final - state ' radiation @xcite . in any part of phase space",
    ", the soft jet cross section contains contributions from radiation off the incoming @xmath10 , off the produced @xmath11 at the production stage , off the @xmath12 and @xmath4 quarks in the @xmath13 decay process , and from interferences between these . in specific regions ,",
    "however , we might expect certain types of radiation to be more important than others .",
    "for example , we would expect radiation close to the beam axis to be dominated by gluon emission off the incoming partons , while radiation close to a @xmath4 quark should be dominated by collinear gluon emission off that quark .",
    "but away from these special collinear regions , all particles ( including the top quarks ) emit gluons with approximately equal strength . in what follows",
    ", we will study the distribution of soft gluon radiation over all of phase space , to see to what extent our expectations about initial- and final - state radiation are valid .",
    "we will see that while the initial-/final - state radiation picture is too nave , a decomposition of the radiation pattern into contributions associated with @xmath11 production , decay , and their interference provides the information necessary for top mass reconstruction .",
    "our purpose in this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we wish to study the correct distributions , where @xmath14 is a typical energy scale of the subprocess . ] to determine where the gluons come from and where they go , in a way that is directly relevant to top momentum reconstruction and mass measurement .",
    "our second aim is to compare these results with simpler models which are characteristic of the way gluon radiation is implemented in monte carlo event generators , such as the initial-/final - state picture mentioned above .",
    "the difference between these approximations and the exact treatment could then provide an indication of the errors implicit in using certain monte carlos to generate extra soft jets in @xmath11 production .",
    "we start with the leading - order process @xmath15 where @xmath16 or @xmath17 , and the particles momenta are indicated in parentheses .",
    "naively , the invariant mass of each @xmath18 system is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "now suppose that the final state contains an extra gluon , with momentum @xmath19 . in terms of feynman diagrams , this gluon can be emitted off ( taking the @xmath20 process as an example ) either of the incoming light quarks , the @xmath21-channel gluon , off either of the top quarks before they decay weakly ( _ i.e. _ , on the timescale of the strong production process ) , off either of the top quarks on the timescale of their weak decay , or off either of the final - state @xmath4 quarks ( and also from the decay products of a hadronically decaying @xmath22 ) .",
    "all of these amplitudes can of course interfere .    because of the infra - red divergence associated with gluon emission , an extra jet in a @xmath11 event will usually be soft . in this case",
    ", one can analyze the radiation pattern in the soft gluon approximation , as was done in refs .",
    "one can write @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the differential cross section for the lowest - order process ( _ i.e. _ , with no gluon radiation ) , @xmath25 is the energy of the soft gluon , and @xmath26 is the strong coupling .",
    "the function @xmath27 is the sum of antenna patterns of the radiation from the different sources listed above .",
    "it can be written generically as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the contribution from emission at the @xmath11 production stage ( including initial - state radiation ) , @xmath30 is the contribution from emission off the @xmath31 and @xmath32 and their decay products at the weak decay stage , and @xmath33 refers to the interferences between these emissions .",
    "more specifically , @xmath33 contains contributions from the interference ( i ) between radiation in the @xmath31 decay and that in the @xmath34 decay and ( ii ) between radiation in @xmath11 production and radiation in either decay . corresponds to @xmath35 , @xmath30 to @xmath36 , and @xmath33 to @xmath37 + 2 { \\rm re}[a(b_2 - b_1)^*]$ ] . ]",
    "note that for soft gluons with @xmath38 , @xmath33 is sensitive to the top decay width , as discussed in ref .",
    "however , the observable soft jets that are relevant to the @xmath0 collider experiments have energies much larger than @xmath39 , and so in practice the interference terms are numerically small .    explicit expressions for @xmath27 for the @xmath40 and @xmath17 subprocesses have been presented in @xcite and are listed again here for completeness : @xmath41 + c_8 [ \\aqiiqii+ \\apiipii -2\\aqiipii ] \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we remind the reader that color antennae exhibit the ` string effect ' : radiation between the two momenta in an antenna is enhanced compared to that outside them ; see for example ref .",
    "we will see several instances below where this effect influences gluon distributions .    for purposes of top momentum reconstruction and mass measurement , this decomposition serves as a guide to what to do with additional soft jets from gluons .",
    "gluons from the production stage are emitted before the @xmath31 and @xmath34 quarks go on shell and should not be included in top momentum reconstruction .",
    "those from the decay stage _ are _ to be included along with the top decay products . for the interference contributions",
    "no such clear  cut assignment is possible ; however for the examples we consider here , the interference contribution is negligible .",

    ", this corresponds to @xmath75 for @xmath76 respectively .",
    "we will use ` isr ' to refer to this model .",
    "a more sophisticated approximation would also include final - state radiation by allowing the @xmath4 quarks to radiate , assuming that they were linked by a second color string , as for example for the process @xmath77 . in this case",

    "the isr and isr / fsr models are easily implemented and are characteristic of what appears in parton - shower monte carlos .",
    "a third possible model corresponds to the naive expectation that the top quarks do not radiate because of their short lifetime .",
    "( in our case , where the relevant gluon energies are larger than @xmath80 , the top quarks _ do _ radiate ; see @xcite for a discussion . )",
    "this model corresponds to taking @xmath81 ( and hence @xmath82 ) in eq .",

    "( [ general ] ) with those from the isr , isr / fsr , and bb models , corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ isronly ] ) , ( [ isrfsronly ] ) , and ( [ bb ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we have seen how the radiation pattern depends on the orientation of the final - state @xmath31 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "this obviously varies from event to event , and in our calculations we must therefore integrate over the full phase space for @xmath11 production and decay and weight by the appropriate parton distributions .",
    "this will then yield the correct radiation pattern in the laboratory frame .",
    "in particular , we will see important differences between the models discussed at the end of the previous section . to understand how and why these differences arise , it is helpful to first work in the parton subprocess center - of - mass , fixing the @xmath31 and @xmath4 momenta in ` typical ' configurations , as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in order to assess the typical final - state configurations , we first generate a sample of events corresponding to @xmath85 with @xmath86 in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 .",
    "figure   shows the resulting distributions in @xmath73 transverse momentum and pseudorapidity , and in the @xmath87 azimuthal angle difference .",
    "the majority of @xmath4 quarks are produced centrally ( _ i.e. _ , within @xmath88 ) and with @xmath89 .",
    "the distribution in azimuthal angle difference shows a slight preference for back - to - back production in the transverse plane .",
    "we note for future reference that the centrality of the @xmath4 s is due in large part to the fact that they receive a boost in the direction of their parent top quarks , which tend to be produced centrally ; this also accounts for their slight back - to - back preference .",
    "we note also that for @xmath90 , the cross section is dominated by the @xmath91 process , which is an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath92 contribution .      to investigate the radiation pattern of soft gluon emission , we choose a configuration with the following properties . for the moment we work in the @xmath11 center - of - mass frame , with subprocess energy @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are produced centrally ( @xmath94 ) and the @xmath4 quarks have @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with the direction of the @xmath4 defining @xmath97 . for purposes of illustration",
    ", we will consider the particular case @xmath98 , which corresponds to @xmath99 .",
    "the distribution of gluon radiation in the @xmath100 plane is then obtained from eq .",
    "( [ softsigma ] ) : @xmath101 at this stage we are only concerned with the general features of the radiation pattern , and so we ( somewhat arbitrarily ) set @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "figure   shows the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ legodist ] ) , for the choice @xmath104 .",
    "the two most obvious features are : ( i ) the strong enhancement of the radiation near the @xmath4 and @xmath105 directions , and ( ii ) the approximately constant ` pedestal ' distribution away from the @xmath4 quark directions and in particular at large positive and negative @xmath106 .",
    "closer inspection reveals another important feature  _",
    "the radiation has minima close to the original @xmath31-quark directions _ , in this case at @xmath107 .",
    "these represent the ` dead cones ' of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 quarks @xcite . in order to study the various individual contributions to the distribution , and to compare different approximations",
    ", it is more useful to consider particular slices through the two - dimensional plot . in fig .",
    "we show the same distribution as a function of @xmath106 for the particular values @xmath108 .",
    "the curves correspond to the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) : the long - dashed line is the production contribution , the short - dashed line is the decay contribution , the dotted line is the interference contribution , and the solid line is the total . for @xmath109 , we clearly see the dead cone of the @xmath4 quark ( in the decay contribution ) and the much broader dead cone of the @xmath31 quark ( in the production contribution ) .",
    "the interference contribution is small . away from the @xmath4-quark direction ,",
    "the production contribution dominates . at @xmath110 the effects of the final - state quarks on the radiation pattern are much reduced , and at @xmath111  which is exactly half - way between the @xmath4 and @xmath112 quarks  the production contribution dominates and the distribution is approximately uniform .",
    "figure   shows the total contribution of fig .",
    "( solid line ) compared to the distributions corresponding to the isr ( dashed line ) and isr / fsr ( dotted line ) models .",
    "the latter is approximately equal to the correct distribution close to the @xmath4-quark direction and at large forward and backward rapidities .",
    "however , it lacks the @xmath31-quark dead - cone effect , and overestimates the radiation in the region between the @xmath4 and @xmath105 quarks .",
    "the isr model gives a constant contribution , and is in strong disagreement with the correct distribution for @xmath113 .",
    "although figs .   and are useful are illustrating particular features of the various models , they correspond to idealized situations where the momenta of the @xmath31 and @xmath4 quarks are fixed . in the next section ,",
    "we present more realistic distributions corresponding to the fully integrated @xmath31- and @xmath4-quark cross sections .      here",
    "we obtain the full distribution of gluons expected in @xmath11 events at the tevatron , for the process @xmath114 , with gluons generated according to eq .",
    "( [ softsigma ] ) .",
    "we use mrs(h ) parton distributions @xcite .",
    "we neglect the @xmath52 process , whose contribution to the cross section is an order of magnitude smaller than that for the @xmath40 initial state .",
    "this simplifies the interpretation of the results because the color structure of the two processes is different @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed entirely at the parton level , and kinematic cuts are kept to a minimum .",
    "we require that the @xmath4 s are produced centrally and that the gluons fall within some typical detector pseudorapidity range .",
    "we also require that the gluons have sufficient transverse momentum to be detectable as soft jets but not so much as to invalidate the soft approximation . finally , we require some angular separation between the @xmath4 s and gluons so that their respective jets are distinguishable .",
    "these requirements are implemented through the following kinematic cuts : @xmath115 note that the @xmath106 cut eliminates the collinear singularities associated with initial - state radiation . with the exception of the cuts on @xmath116 and to some extent @xmath106 ,",
    "our results are not particularly sensitive to the exact values used .",
    "energy and transverse momentum distributions of the resulting gluons are shown as solid lines in figure ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "there are no surprises ; the figures display the expected fall - off with increasing energy and @xmath117 , and reflect the lower and upper cutoffs .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "are the individual contributions according to the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) , with contributions from production and decay appearing as dotted and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the interference contribution is negligible for the energies considered here and is not shown in this plot or any that follow .",
    "we see that the energy distribution from the production piece extends to higher energies than that from decay , and that the decay @xmath117 distribution is relatively flatter than that from production .",
    "the difference between the distributions of gluons produced in the production and decay stages is displayed more dramatically in the gluon pseudorapidity distribution , figure .",
    "we are most interested in angular distributions in any case because we want to know where the soft jets are likely to appear in detectors .",
    "figure shows the net @xmath106 distribution ( solid line ) along with the production ",
    "decay decompostion as in the previous figure .",
    "the decay contribution is peaked in the center and falls off quickly , whereas the production piece has a central dip and peaks in the forward direction .",
    "these results are easily understood when we consider the sources of the gluons ; _ cf . _",
    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "gluons from the decay contribution come from radiation off the top and bottom quark lines .",
    "radiation is largest near the quarks direction of motion , and the quarks are , for the most part , produced centrally .",
    "furthermore , we note that the string effect in the @xmath31@xmath4 and @xmath34@xmath84 antenna pieces ( the @xmath118 and @xmath119 terms in @xmath71 ) tends to enhance central radiation compared to that in the forward regions when the quarks are produced centrally . similarly",
    ", the production piece arises from radiation off initial - state quarks and the @xmath31 and @xmath34 , and we get enhancement in the forward direction .",
    "the net effect is a total distribution that is slightly peaked in the center and falls off sharply above @xmath120 or so .",
    "let us now compare these distributions with what we obtain using the simpler models described above .",
    "it seems plausible that the isr / fsr model ( initial - state and final - state radiation only , assuming color singlet initial and final states ) would give a reasonable approximation to the correct distribution , with isr corresponding to the production piece and fsr corresponding to decay .",
    "figure shows net @xmath106 distributions for the various models , with the solid line again indicating the correct distribution according to eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "we see that the isr model gives the flat rapidity distribution characteristic of initial - state radiation .",
    "comparison with the production contribution in fig .",
    "( note the difference in vertical scales ) shows that the isr model significantly overestimates the amount of radiation in the central region .",
    "adding to that radiation off the final @xmath4 s to obtain the isr / fsr distribution ( dashed lines ) leads to an even greater overestimate .",
    "hence the isr / fsr model is not a particularly good approximation to the full prediction : the overall normalization is too large and the total shape is wrong , being too strongly peaked in the center .",
    "the other simple model  the bb model , in which the radiation is treated as in the direct @xmath121 production process @xmath122  _ does _ in fact reproduce the net @xmath106 distribution reasonably well ; see the dot - dashed line in fig .  .",
    "despite the fact that , for the gluon energies of interest here , the top width @xmath80 can be considered to be small , the @xmath81 limit seems to yield a good approximation to the full prediction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the results seem to be independent of the @xmath43 and @xmath123 factors in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is related to the fact that radiation close to the @xmath4 quarks is universal , independent of the process ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) . but",
    "this result is deceptive for a number of reasons .",
    "first , depending as it does on radiation near the @xmath4 s , it is sensitive to our choice of @xmath116 cut ; if the gluons are restricted to be farther away from the @xmath4 s , the agreement deteriorates .",
    "more important , although the @xmath124 distribution seems to be well reproduced , the distribution in azimuthal angle is not , as we shall see below . finally ,",
    "because radiation off the @xmath31 quarks is ignored , there is no way to decompose the results into production and decay contributions .",
    "we now address the question ,  what should be done with extra soft jets in attempts to reconstruct the top quark four - momentum ? \"",
    "as stated above , the decomposition of the gluon distributions into contributions from gluons radiated in top production and those radiated in decay provides guidance .",
    "whether additional gluons in @xmath11 events should be combined with the @xmath4 and @xmath22 depends on what stage they are associated with : production gluons should not be combined , and decay gluons should . in principle there is also a contribution from interference terms which can not be definitely associate with either stage , but in practice , for gluons sufficiently energetic to be identified as soft jets , these interference terms are negligible .    with this in mind , we return to the decomposition of the gluon pseudorapidity distribution shown in fig .  .",
    "we saw that gluons in the forward region are much more likely to have come from the production than the decay stage .",
    "hence most forward gluons do not contribute to the top momentum , and based on these parton ",
    "level results it seems safe to conclude that soft jets with @xmath125 can be ignored without introducing large systematic errors into the mass measurement .",
    "( this assumes , of course , that such jets are correctly identified . )",
    "unfortunately the situation is less clear - cut in the central region . despite the central suppression of production - stage gluons , fig .",
    "shows that gluons in the central region are almost as likely to have come from production as from decay ; in fact , with a larger @xmath116 cut , central gluons would be dominated by production .",
    "note that the situation is even worse for the simpler models , since the isr @xmath106 distribution is flat , and the bb model allows for no decomposition at all .    in an attempt to identify a quantity that shows a clear excess in the decay contribution , we consider proximity to the @xmath4 or @xmath84 quark .",
    "it is certainly plausible to expect that soft jets near the @xmath4 s are likely to have come from decay",
    " stage gluons . figure ( a ) shows the gluon distribution as a function of the cosine of the angle between the @xmath4 and @xmath126 , with the usual decomposition into production and decay contributions ( dots and dashes , respectively ) , and total ( solid ) . the production piece is flat , as expected since there is no dependence on the @xmath4 direction in @xmath29 , and the decay piece increases as the gluon approaches the @xmath4 . at first sight",
    "this looks promising  there is an excess in the decay piece near the @xmath4 .",
    "however , this result should not be taken quite at face value because the amount of this excess is extremely sensitive to the cuts , especially that on @xmath116 between the gluon and @xmath4 .",
    "the excess can be reduced or even eliminated by reducing the gluon @xmath117 range or increasing the @xmath116 cut .",
    "this would be compounded in practice by fragmentation of the partons into hadrons .",
    "we can improve the situation by taking advantage of the difference in the production and decay pseudorapidity distributions and making a tighter @xmath106 cut to eliminate much of the production contribution while retaining almost all of that from decay .",
    "figure ( b ) shows that requiring @xmath127 does indeed enhance the latter  the excess in the region near the @xmath4 quark is now more pronounced .",
    "unfortunately , the same caveats about cuts and fragmentation apply here , and we can not safely quantify this excess or draw any firm conclusions .",
    "it is clear from what we have seen above that assignments of soft jets to the production or decay stages can not be made unambiguously on an event - by - event basis .",
    "however , we can minimize errors associated with soft jet ambiguities if we know what to expect from the correct gluon distribution and its decomposition and include it in our simulations .",
    "eventually we may hope to find additional discriminators that improve the chances of making correct assignments , leading ultimately to a useful prescription for dealing with soft jets .",
    "the results shown here represent a first step in that direction .",
    "we do not perform mass reconstruction simulations here , since we do not use exact kinematics in the soft gluon approximation . in future work",
    "we intend to dispense with the soft approximation and perform the exact calculation , which will allow us to investigate more specifically issues associated with mass reconstruction .",
    "we close this section by noting that the color structure of the process process @xmath114 can give rise to distinctive effects in the gluon radiation pattern that can be explored experimentally , at least in principle .",
    "in particular , a forward  backward asymmetry appears in the distribution of gluons for an appropriately chosen class of final - state configuations . while not directly relevant to top mass measurement , this asymmetry helps to illuminate further some of the physics involved , for example the fact that the top quarks themselves can radiate gluons .",
    "this asymmetry arises as a consequence of the string effects in the various antennae , that is , the enhancement of radiation between two quarks connected by a color string @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in @xmath51 the @xmath128 antenna produces more radiation in the region between the @xmath31 and @xmath129 than , say , between the @xmath31 and @xmath130 .",
    "this gives rise to a forward  backward asymmetry in the gluon radiation .",
    "this asymmetry is canceled in the net distribution by the @xmath131 antenna , of course . however , with suitably chosen cuts we can enhance one contribution ( from radiation off the @xmath31 , say ) while suppressing the other , thereby recovering the asymmetry .",
    "we do this by taking advantage of the fact that there is more radiation from a quark in the regions nearby than those far away .    guided also by the fact that the direction of the @xmath4 quarks momenta tend not to be too different from those of their parent @xmath31 s , we add to the event selection criteria of eq .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) the requirement that the separation in azimuthal angle between the @xmath4 and @xmath84 be greater than @xmath132 .",
    "this tends to select events in which the parent @xmath31 and @xmath34 have similar separation .",
    "we then preferentially select gluons associated with the @xmath31 ( as opposed to the @xmath34 ) by requiring that they lie within @xmath133 in azimuth of the @xmath4 quark .",
    "figure  ( a ) shows the resulting distribution as a solid line .",
    "a clear excess is visible in the forward direction , which is the direction of the initial quark s momentum .",
    "an equal and opposite asymmetry is obtained by considering gluons within @xmath133 of azimuth of the @xmath84 .    that the source of this asymmetry is indeed the terms involving the initial quark and the @xmath31 and @xmath34 ( _ cf . _ eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) ) can be seen from the decomposition shown in fig .",
    "( a ) , where , as in earlier figures , the production contribution is shown as the dotted line and the decay contribution is the dashed line .",
    "we see that the entire asymmetry comes from the production piece .",
    "the decay piece involves only the top and bottom momenta and there is no correlation with the initial quarks .",
    "finally , the asymmetry distribution reveals major discrepancies between the correct distribution and all three of the simpler models , as shown in figure ( b ) . in the isr ( dotted line ) and isr / fsr ( dashed line ) models ,",
    "in which there is no connection between radiation from the initial and final states , there can be no forward  backward asymmetry .",
    "in contrast , the bb model has a more pronounced asymmetry even than the correct distribution because , without radiation from the top quarks , the antennae connecting initial- and final - state quarks are enhanced .",
    "this difference between bb and the correct result shows that the bb model does not contain the correct azimuthal dependence , despite the fact that it appears to reproduce the correct total @xmath106 distribution in fig .  .",
    "the pattern of soft gluon radiation in @xmath134 production in hadronic collisions has a very rich structure .",
    "the initial - state partons , the @xmath31 and @xmath4 quarks can all radiate , and the gluon distribution in any part of phase space is a combination of what can be termed ` production ' , ` decay ' and ` interference ' contributions .",
    "apart from providing some interesting tests of the color structure of the events , there are important implications for top mass measurements from the invariant mass of the decay products . in this study",
    "we have attempted to illustrate the general features of the radiation pattern .",
    "we have quantified the idea that soft jets close to the @xmath4 quarks can be associated with gluon emission in the top decay process , while radiation at large rapidities can be associated with radiation at the @xmath135 production stage .",
    "we have compared the full qcd prediction with those of simpler models , which are characteristic of how radiation may be implemented in monte carlo event generators .",
    "it is not difficult to find regions of phase space where the models differ significantly from the full prediction .",
    "our conclusion is that the question of how to handle additional soft jets in @xmath135 events when reconstructing the top momentum is far from trivial . in a future study",
    "we intend to go beyond the soft gluon approximation to study the invariant mass distributions themselves .",
