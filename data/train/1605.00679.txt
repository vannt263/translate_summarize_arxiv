    "accordingly , an investigation of @xmath0 with a quasidynamical event generator hipse  @xcite was carried out .",
    "it reveals that the event selection based on multiplicity and the geometrical sharp - cut approximation is not a correct centrality selector .",
    "indeed , corroborating earlier findings  @xcite , we show that this selection approach strongly mixes events of different impact parameters over a rather broad span of @xmath61 values ; cf .",
    "when a properly weighted contribution of @xmath61 s involved in the high - multiplicity events is accounted for , the isotropy ratios calculated for the thus relaxed centrality requirement and those strictly central do not differ much .",
    "the thus extracted @xmath74 does not change much as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the derived @xmath75 values are based on a number of strong assumptions that allowed the link between the stopping ratio @xmath0 and the in - medium @xmath4 cross section  @xcite .",
    "hence , besides further experimental and theoretical considerations of the stopping observable @xmath0 intended to disentangle the remaining ambiguities a study of other related observables may shed some fresh light on the subject .",
    "in addition , the experimentally observed strong and rapid change of the effective in - medium residual @xmath4 cross section beyond the fermi energy urges for an _ ab initio _ theoretical analysis of this problem , the solution of which might lie in the way the exclusion principle is accounted for  @xcite and/or by incorporating the recent observation of short - range correlations in nuclei  @xcite .",
