    "to date , no molecules bearing the light elements phosphorus ( p ) and sulfur ( s ) have been detected in the atmosphere of titan by either remote sensing or in - situ methods .",
    "however , from cosmological considerations both p and s must have been present in the icy planetesimals that formed titan , and also delivered in trace quantities by later impacts .",
    "p in the form of ph@xmath0  is found in jupiter s atmosphere at approximately solar abundance , while on saturn its abundance is around 3@xmath3 solar @xcite .",
    "this enrichment is in line with core - accretion models , which predict that saturn had a larger ice - to - gas fraction in its formation compared to jupiter .",
    "sulfur is enriched on jupiter by 2.5@xmath3 solar @xcite ( and not yet detected on saturn ) , perhaps due to easy formation of h@xmath1s  clathrate hydrates @xcite .",
    "both p and s should therefore be present in titan s bulk composition at fractions greater than those on saturn , since the ice to gas ratio must have been much higher .",
    "@xcite considered a possible role for sulfur compounds in titan cryovolcanism , suggesting that ammonium sulfate could form a magma in titan s mantle .",
    "plumes of this magma could dissolve methane present in crustal clathrates , allowing explosive release to the surface .",
    "one prediction of this model is that ammonium or other sulfates should be detectable spectroscopically on titan s surface , as is the case on europa and ganymede .",
    "such a model would presumably also release trace amounts of sulfur into titan s atmosphere , especially in the wake of eruptions .",
    "@xcite focused on the role of phosphorus in titan , arguing that it could be delivered both endogenously and exogenously to the surface .",
    "phosphine is efficiently trapped in clathrate hydrates , and @xcite show that all clathrates that trap h@xmath1s  also trap at least as much ph@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , they show that ph@xmath0  is more soluble in organic liquids than in water , and therefore any phosphine released from melted clathrates could be dissolved in titan s hydrocarbon lakes , and would participate in the hydrocarbon meteorological cycle .",
    "we have therefore searched the infrared spectrum of titan for the signatures of the two most likely carriers of p and s : phosphine ( ph@xmath0 ) and hydrogen sulfide ( h@xmath1s ) .",
    "our data is from the composite infrared spectrometer ( cirs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , carried onboard the cassini spacecraft , which has been making close flybys of titan since attaining saturn orbit in mid-2004 .",
    "both gases have signatures in the 811 @xmath4 m  ( 1250900  @xmath5 ) range , which is largely free of the hydrocarbon emissions that dominate much of titan s infrared spectrum .",
    "we first model and subtract out the emissions of known species including methane ( ch@xmath6 ) , acetylene ( c@xmath1h@xmath1 ) , ethylene ( c@xmath1h@xmath6 ) and deuterated methane ( ch@xmath0d ) .",
    "we then add h@xmath1s  and ph@xmath0  incrementally to our spectral calculation using standard line lists from hitran @xcite , and compare the predictions to the remaining titan spectrum .    by comparing the model predictions to the instrument noise level at the 1 , 2 , and 3-@xmath2 levels ,",
    "we have derived the first numerical upper limits on the prevalence of h@xmath1s  and ph@xmath0  in titan s stratosphere .",
    "we follow a report of our results with a discussion of the implications for existing models , and finish with some conclusions about the prospects for future searches .",
    "the cassini cirs instrument is a dual design , comprising mid - infrared ( 1400600  @xmath5 ) and far - infrared ( 60010  @xmath5 ) spectrometers , both with a fwhm ( full - width to half - maximum ) spectral resolution variable from 0.515.5  @xmath5   after hamming apodization .",
    "the mid - ir michelson spectrometer employs two @xmath7 detector arrays : focal plane 3 ( fp3 , 6001100  @xmath5 ) and focal plane 4 ( fp4 , 11001400  @xmath5 ) .",
    "both arrays have square pixels with fields of view 0.3 mrad across .",
    "fp4 has the highest sensitivity ( lowest background noise ) and least instrumental interferences , and was consequently used in this study .",
    "the observations were described in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the spectra were acquired during the 55@xmath8 titan flyby ( t55 ) of cassini on may 22@xmath9 2009 , in a four - hour period when the spacecraft was at a range of 116,000177,000  km .",
    "the observation ( known as ` mirlmpair'-type ) was targeted at titan s limb , with the two arrays above and parallel to the horizon .",
    "fp4 was above fp3 , with the pixels centered at an altitude of 247 km ( 0.27 mbar ) and spanning approximately 44  km ( just under one scale height ) in the vertical direction at the mid - point of the observation . using cirs pair mode ,",
    "all ten detectors simultaneously recorded data , paired into five receiver channels . a total of 941 pair - mode spectra at 0.5  @xmath5  resolution were selected and then averaged to create a single , high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio spectrum .",
    "the cirs fp4 limb spectrum was then modeled to remove the signatures of known gas species .",
    "these included ch@xmath6  ( @xmath10 band at 1305  @xmath5 ) and ch@xmath0d  ( @xmath11 band at 1156  @xmath5 ) , plus some weaker contributions from the hydrocarbons c@xmath1h@xmath6  and c@xmath1h@xmath1 .",
    "the modeling closely follows that described in a recent paper @xcite , and is briefly summarized here .",
    "an initial vertical atmospheric model was created with 100 layers equally spaced in log pressure from 1.45 bar to 0.05 @xmath4bar , based on the temperature profile and major gas abundances ( n@xmath1 , ch@xmath6 , h@xmath1 ) determined by the huygens probe @xcite .",
    "other gas species ( c@xmath1h@xmath6 , c@xmath1h@xmath1 ) were included with constant vertical abundances in the stratosphere , at initial values taken from previous cirs measurements at low latitudes @xcite . similarly a uniformly mixed ( constant particles / g atmosphere ) stratospheric",
    "haze was included with optical properties from @xcite .",
    "the forward radiative transfer model was computed using the nemesis code @xcite applied to the model atmosphere and using the hitran gas line atlas @xcite , and then convolved with the fp4 detector spatial response shapes @xcite to generate a model spectrum .    at this point",
    "the model was iterated to arrive at an optimum fit to the measured spectrum , by adjusting the model temperature profile ( at each layer ) and uniform vertical gas abundances of c@xmath1h@xmath1  and c@xmath1h@xmath6 , to minimize a cost function similar to a @xmath12 figure of merit .",
    "this approach has been successfully used to fit the t55 limb spectrum of titan in previous work @xcite .",
    "fig  [ fig : fit ] ( a ) shows the best fit to the data . note that a weak band of propane ( @xmath13 at 1158  @xmath5 ) was not included in the model , as a line list for this band has yet to be produced , and shows clearly in the data - model residual ( fig  [ fig : fit ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the strong ch@xmath6  @xmath10 band is fitted reasonably well , but also shows some residual mismatch , which may be due to imperfect knowledge of the underlying haze ( continuum ) opacity and/or wavelength calibration uncertainties .      to search for ph@xmath0  and h@xmath1s , we avoided spectral regions that showed non - random ` noise ' residual : especially the c@xmath0h@xmath14  @xmath13 region ( 11401200  @xmath5 ) and the ch@xmath6  region ( @xmath15  @xmath5 )",
    ". this permitted us to search for the @xmath10 band of ph@xmath0  around 1120  @xmath5 , and for a portion of the weak h@xmath1s  @xmath16 band at 12001250  @xmath5  ( see fig  [ fig : fit ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the summed line strengths in these regions were @xmath17 cm molecule@xmath18 for 1121 lines of ph@xmath0  from 10801140  @xmath5 , and @xmath19 cm molecule@xmath18 for 130 lines of h@xmath1s  at 12001250  @xmath5 , using line data from hitran @xcite .",
    "note that the ph@xmath0  band intensity was almost @xmath20 that of h@xmath1s  in the spectral ranges considered , so we expect @xmath20 greater sensitivity to ph@xmath0  compared to h@xmath1s .",
    "these two gas species were added to the best - fit atmospheric model at fixed trial abundances of 1 ppb with other gases and temperature held constant at the previously retrieved values , and nemesis was allowed to retrieve a ` best fit ' abundance for the new species . in both cases , these retrievals resulted in no statistically significant improvement to the model @xmath12 , hereafter designated @xmath21 : the minimum @xmath12 .",
    "we then proceeded to calculate upper limits to the abundances , following the approach of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "starting with very low trial gas abundances in the model , these were increased incrementally , and at each value the forward spectral model was calculated , without optimized fitting or inversion , and the data - model @xmath12 computed . as the trial gas abundances increase",
    ", so too does the @xmath22 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : ulimits ] .",
    "following @xcite the 1 , 2 and 3-@xmath2 upper limits to the gas abundances occur at @xmath23 .",
    "table 1 shows our results .",
    "the derived 1 , 2 , 3-@xmath2 maximum abundances for ph@xmath0  are 0.3 , 1.1 , 2.2 ppb respectively , while the corresponding values for h@xmath1s  are 91 , 330 , 700 ppb .",
    "the h@xmath1s  upper limits are some two orders of magnitude higher than those of ph@xmath0  as expected , due to the much weaker band intensity in the spectral region considered , along with a higher 1-@xmath2 nesr ( noise equivalent spectral radiance ) level in the corresponding spectral interval ( 0.6 versus 0.3 nw  @xmath24sr@xmath18/@xmath5 ) .",
    "sulfur compounds have been suggested to play a role in titan cryovolcanism @xcite , and therefore be present in trace amounts in titan s atmosphere .",
    "phosphorus is also easily dissolved in organic solvents , and as such could be a component of titan s present - day methane - ethane lakes , and participate in the hydrocarbon cycle @xcite . a simple calculation tracing the saturation vapor pressure ( data from public nist and crc databases ) up through titan",
    "s troposphere using the huygens temperature profile , indicates that abundances of ph@xmath0  and h@xmath1s  that could reach the stratosphere are 6 and 0.035 ppb respectively .",
    "therefore , our 2-@xmath2 upper limit of 1 ppb for ph@xmath0  provides some constraint on tropospheric ph@xmath0 , while our h@xmath1s  limit of 330 ppb is four orders of magnitude greater than allowed in this scenario and is not constraining .    at the present time , the lack of detection of p or s - bearing species anywhere in titan s atmosphere has caused these elements to be omitted from present photochemical models , so we have no predictions for comparison . in future",
    ", it could be interesting for such models to allow for some injection of p and s molecules into the atmosphere through a putative eruption , and to investigate subsequent chemistry , for example , conversion of sulfates to sulfides .",
    "in this paper we have searched for simple compounds of phosphorus and sulfur in titan s infrared spectrum recorded by cassini cirs , placing the first upper limits on the abundance of ph@xmath0  and h@xmath1s . in the stratosphere at 247 km we find that no more than 1 ppb of ph@xmath0  and 330 ppb of h@xmath1s  can be present , at the 2-@xmath2 level of significance . some potential exists for improving on these upper limits using cirs , e.g. by future measurements at a lower limb altitude where the atmospheric density is greater .",
    "the peak sensitivity for weak trace gases is often near 10  mbar ( @xmath25100  km ) , at least at low latitudes , so a repeat measurement in the lower stratosphere may yield more stringent limits .",
    "searching in the far - ir spectrum may prove helpful in the case of h@xmath1s , which has rotational lines at 50150  @xmath5   that are some @xmath26 stronger than the @xmath16 considered here .",
    "however in this region the nesr of cirs fp1 is more than @xmath27 higher than that of the fp4 detectors used in this work , and suffers from systematic noise artifacts .",
    "nevertheless , the sub - mm range has already proved productive for molecular line searches by instruments such as herschel and ground - based sub - mm telescopes , resulting in the detections of ch@xmath0cn   @xcite and hnc @xcite , and will doubtless reveal further new species in due course .    19 natexlab#1#1url # 1`#1`urlprefix[2][]#2 [ 2]#2 , , , , , , , , , , , , , . .",
