    ", it appears evident that the set of operations characterizing a quantum computer is strictly larger than the operations possible in a classical hardware .",
    "this speculation is at the basis of quantum speedups that have been achieved for oracular and search problems @xcite .",
    "particularly significant is the exponential speed up achieved for the prime factorization of large numbers @xcite , a problem for which no efficient classical algorithm is currently known .",
    "another attractive area for quantum computers is quantum simulation @xcite where it has recently been shown that the dynamics of chemical reactions @xcite as well as molecular electronic structure  @xcite are attractive applications for quantum devices .",
    "for all these instances , the realization of a quantum computer would challenge the extended church - turing thesis ( ect ) , which claims that a turing machine can efficiently simulate any physically realizable system , and even disprove it if prime factorization was finally demonstrated to be not efficiently solvable on classical machines .        at the same time , the realization of a full - scale quantum computer is a very demanding technological challenge , even if it is not forbidden by fundamental physics .",
    "this fact motivated the search for intermediate quantum hardware that could efficiently solve specific computational problems , believed to be intractable with classical machines , without being capable of universal quantum computation .",
    "recently , aaronson and arkhipov found that sampling the distribution of photons at the output of a linear photonic network is expected ( modulo a few conjectures ) to be computationally inefficient for any classical computer since it would require the estimation of lots of matrix permanents @xcite . on the contrary , this task is naturally simulated by indistinguishable photons injected as input of a photonic network ( see the pictorial description of boson sampling in fig .  [",
    "fig : pictorial]*a * ) . while several groups have already realized small - scale versions of boson sampling @xcite , to challenge the ect one also has to demonstrate the scalability of the experimental architecture @xcite .",
    "while boson sampling is likely to play a major role in the debate around the ect , it also appears as a somewhat artificial problem in which we ask a classical computer to predict the behaviour of a quantum machine ( under certain working conditions ) and then compare its efficiency to the direct operation of the machine itself . in this work",
    ", we present a connection between boson sampling and the calculation of molecular vibronic ( vibrational and electronic ) spectra related to molecular processes such as absorption , emission , photoelectron and resonance raman ( see table  [ tab : bsvib ] ) @xcite .",
    "the proposed simulation scheme provides a second , chemically - relevant reason to realize boson sampling machines .",
    "the calculation of franck - condon ( fc ) factors with duschinsky mode mixing  @xcite represent a computationally difficult problem and various strategies have been developed to overcome the difficulties ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "we show that the quantum simulation , and hence the calculation of fc factors lying at the heart of linear spectroscopy , can be efficiently performed on a boson sampling machine simply by modifying the input state .",
    "this connection provides a scientific and industrially relevant problem with a physical and chemical meaning well separated from the simulation of linear quantum optical networks .",
    "a complementary approach for the quantum simulation of molecular vibrations in quantum optics using a time domain approach was recently introduced by laing _",

    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the boson sampling problem and the duschinsky relation in terms of unitary operators , then we compare the two physical problems and suggest how to obtain molecular vibronic spectra with a boson sampling device .",
    "we also provide examples concerning the photoelectron spectra of formic acid and thymine  @xcite .",
    "finally , we conclude with an outlook for the use of boson sampling devices in chemistry and molecular physics .",
    "boson sampling considers the input of @xmath4 photons into @xmath5 optical modes .",
    "this quantum space can be described through a fock basis that takes notice of the number of photons distributed in each mode : we denote such states by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 corresponds to the number of photons in the @xmath8-th mode and we have the constraint @xmath9 .",
    "these photons are sent through a linear optical network whose action is characterized by the unitary operation @xmath10 . in this way , any input state @xmath11 is related to the corresponding output state @xmath12 through the relation ,    @xmath13    given this setup , the problem is to compute the transition probability between input and output states in the fock basis expressed by the quantity , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the input state and @xmath16 the desired state in output . to facilitate the notation",
    ", we introduce the states , @xmath17 to explicitly label which states have passed through the boson sampling apparatus . as the total number of photons and the number of modes increase , the probability distribution of output states becomes hard to predict with classical computers , but it can be directly measured with linear optics devices . the computation of this distribution can be performed in a number of ways , but here , to facilitate the forthcoming connections , we follow a construction that is similar to those used in vibronic spectroscopy .",
    "the basis set expansion of the input state ( @xmath18 ) in the output fock states ( @xmath19 ) is given by ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the set of all possible @xmath22 having the total number of photons @xmath23 .",
    "coherent states can be expanded in terms of fock states and the overlap integrals @xmath24 can be obtained from the overlap integral of two coherent states ( @xmath25 ) , which are rotated with respect to each other in the phase space  @xcite . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath5-dimensional complex ( column ) vectors defining the coherent states @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the unitary rotation operator @xmath30 acts on a column vector of creation operators @xmath31 and to produce a vector of rotated creation operators @xmath32 defined as ,    @xmath33    where we use a shorthand notation  @xcite for the operator action on the column vector of the boson creation operators , _ i.e. _ @xmath34 it is straightforward to verify that the bosonic commutation relations @xmath35=\\delta_{kl}$ ] are satisfied also for the rotated operators ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath36=\\delta_{kl}$ ] .",
    "one can obtain the transition amplitude @xmath24 in two distinct ways : one way involves taking partial derivatives of @xmath37  @xcite :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , and the second approach involves computing matrix permanents ( per ) of submatrices of @xmath40  @xcite as described by @xmath41_{\\mathbf{n},\\mathbf{m}}\\right)\\right)^ { * } \\ , , \\label{eq : permanent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42_{\\mathbf{n},\\mathbf{m}}$ ] being a @xmath43 submatrix of @xmath40 obtained by repeating the @xmath44-th column of @xmath40 @xmath45 times and copying the @xmath46-th row of the column of the resulting matrix @xmath47 times  @xcite .",
    "the transition probability measured in boson sampling setups , which is proportional to @xmath48 , can be considered a calculation of the permanent of the matrix described above through the relation  @xcite , @xmath49_{\\mathbf{n},\\mathbf{m}}\\right)\\right\\vert^2      = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{m } n_{k } !",

    "the calculation of matrix permanents is a computationally hard problem for many classes of matrices belonging to the complexity class # p  @xcite , and this suggests that the same might be true for the computation of derivatives of the coherent states overlap integral for some coherent states .",
    "the partial derivative approach is commonly used in the computation of the overlap of vibrational states  @xcite , and it is easy to see that the space of @xmath4 photons in @xmath5 optical modes is isomorphic to the space of @xmath4 molecular vibrational quanta ( phonons ) in @xmath5 vibrational modes .",
    "this connection suggests that the dynamics of vibrational modes is computationally difficult , at least for some instances .",
    "however , a simple unitary transformation of the modes is not sufficient to reproduce vibronic spectra .",
    "additional effects need to be taken into account , as explained in the next subsection .",
    "molecular vibronic spectroscopies such as absorption , emission , photoelectron , and resonance raman are fundamental probes for molecular properties .",
    "the corresponding vibronic transitions involve two electronic states and one can extract the molecular structural and force field changes from the spectra .",

    "an electronic transition of a molecule induces nuclear structural and force changes at the new electronic state .",
    "this defines a new set of vibrational modes that are displaced , distorted  hence showing a frequency change , and rotated with respect to the vibrational modes of the ground electronic state ( see table  [ tab : bsvib ] first row and second column ) . within the harmonic approximation of the electronic energy surfaces and the assumption of coordinate - independent electronic transition moment ( the condon approximation ) ,",
    "the vibronic transition profiles can be obtained by the overlap integral of the two @xmath5-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) eigenstates ( fc integral ) , where @xmath51 for non - linear ( linear ) molecules with @xmath52 atoms .    in order to describe these effects and compute vibronic profiles ,",
    "duschinsky  @xcite proposed a linear relation between the initial ( mass - weighted ) normal coordinates ( @xmath53 ) and the final coordinates ( @xmath54 ) , which reads    @xmath55    where @xmath40 is the duschinsky rotation ( real ) matrix and @xmath56 is the displacement ( real ) vector .",

    "if all the phonon frequencies are identical and there is no displacement , the duschinsky relation ( eq .  ) can be directly reduced to the original boson sampling problem ( eq .  ) .",

    "one obtains an estimate of the fcp . by the central limit theorem , the number of samples required to reach a desired precision @xmath137 scales as @xmath151 . as the kronecker delta function is constrained to have a value of either @xmath81 or @xmath152 , the variance of @xmath153 in this case",
    "can be bounded by @xmath152 , and the number of expected samples to converge fcp for a given frequency may be bounded by a constant dictated by the fixed precision @xmath137 .",
    "we note also that this constant bound is an upper bound on the number of required samples , and some distributions and experiments will require far less samples . for example , distributions with a small number of peaks ( at the resolution determined by @xmath138 ) may converge extremely rapidly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : formicacid_mc ] , we simulate the results of what one would expect , accordingly , in a boson sampling simulation of formic acid .",
    "this is done by stochastic sampling ( eq .  ) on the known probability distributions for the output modes and analysed according to eq .  .",
    "the results from this simulation indicate relatively few samples are needed from the device to resolve the overall shape of the spectrum , supporting the experimental feasibility of the approach .",
