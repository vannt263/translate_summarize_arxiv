    "systems composed of two quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "many theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that the physical properties of such double quantum dots ( dqds ) are much richer than those of individual ones . on the one hand",
    ", this may pave the way to new applications , including long - time storage of quantum information @xcite , conditional optical control @xcite that may lead to an implementation of a two - qubit quantum gate @xcite , generation of entangled photons @xcite or coherent optical spin control and entangling @xcite . on the other hand , in order to take advantage of these extended possibilities ,",
    "the properties of dqds have to be understood and controlled .",
    "there are two major factors that determine the physical ( in particular , optical ) properties of dqds : the coupling between the dots and their interaction with the environment . in both these areas",
    "new features appear , as compared to the physics of individual dots .",
    "both problems have been in the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical work but many important questions remain open .",
    "coupling between the dots is essential for quantum conditional control , entanglement formation and implementation of two - qubit gates .",
    "it is therefore understandable that considerable experimental effort has been devoted to demonstrating its existence in double dot systems @xcite , while theoretical studies were aimed at characterizing its signatures in the optical response of dqds @xcite .",
    "coupling of dqds to their environment is affected by collective effects , which may lead to superradiance phenomena @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies on the dephasing ( in particular , decay of entanglement ) in double dot systems have shown that coherence properties strongly depend on whether the dots are coupled to a common reservoir or to separate reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the collective nature of the coupling to the environment allows one to construct arrays ( collective quantum bits ) which are more resistant to decoherence than individual systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , in any such array of two - level systems collectively coupled to their common reservoir , the dephasing of some states is slowed down , while other states decohere faster . in the case of radiative decay , an essential role",
    "is played by the transition energy mismatch between the systems forming the array @xcite .",
    "these subradiance and superradiance effects influence the optical response of dqds and can affect the coherence properties of dqd - based quantum devices .    since the paper by dicke @xcite ,",
    "coherent effects in the radiative decay of two or more atoms have been studied in numerous works .",
    "the emission from identical @xcite and non - identical @xcite two - level systems has been studied and methods suitable for the description of arrays of various shapes have been developed @xcite .",
    "systems formed by qds share many features with those made of natural atoms . in particular , qd samples may be modelled as ensembles of two - level systems with parallel transition dipoles , corresponding to the fundamental optical ( interband ) transition between the ground ( ` empty dot ' ) state and the confined exciton state ( electron - hole pair in the dot ) , although one should not expect the transition energies to be exactly matched in these artificial objects . nonetheless , these semiconductor structures are specific with some respects .",
    "the spacing between qds in intentionally manufactured dqd systems is typically of the order of nanometers , that is 23 orders of magnitude smaller than the wave length of the resonantly coupled radiation .",
    "this allows one to assume the dicke limit of the coupling and neglect the retardation effects , which were one of the major concerns in the general theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "small distance between the two dots precludes individual addressing of each system by the exciting field so that only certain initial states may be prepared .",
    "this means , in particular , that the two - excitation ( biexciton , i.e. , one electron - hole pair in each qd of the dqd structure ) states must be included in the description ( except for the weak excitation limit ) .",
    "( color online ) graphical representation of the energy levels ( basis states ) and couplings in the double quantum dot system.,width=55 ]    another important feature that distinguishes qds from atomic samples is the presence of two kinds of dipole couplings .",
    "one of them is the direct interaction between static dipole moments associated with the electron - hole charge distribution in the two - dots @xcite .",
    "this kind of coupling is obviously present only if the two dots are occupied by excitons and its effect is to shift the energy of the biexciton state ( denoted by @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the other coupling is related to the interband matrix elements of the electric dipole moment and is analogous to the frster coupling in molecular systems as well as to dipole couplings between atoms which appear in the description of superradiance phenomena in atomic samples .",
    "it couples the two single - exciton states of the system via a process that may be imagined as a recombination of the exciton in one of the dots with the subsequent transfer of energy to the other one ( via coulomb interaction ) , where the exciton is recreated ( this coupling is denoted by @xmath1 in fig .  [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "thus , this coupling has an `` excitation transfer '' character . in qds , this interaction is modified by the finite size of the charge distribution ( the qd size is comparable with the inter - dot distance ) and has a finite value in the formal limit of vanishing distance @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not a universal function of the distance . finally , apart from this dipole - dipole coupling , other kinds of interaction may be present ( e.g. , effective ` tunneling ' coupling accounting for a slight overlap of wave functions which may dominate over the frster coupling for closely spaced dots ) . for these reasons ,",
    "the strength of the coupling between the dots becomes an essentially independent parameter .",
    "all in all , there are three independent parameters governing the radiative properties of a double - dot system in the dicke limit , compared to two in the case of atoms .",
    "in this paper we study the interplay of all the factors affecting the optical response of a dqd : the coupling between the two dots forming the dqd , the mismatch between their transition energies and their collective interaction with the radiation environment ( vacuum ) . with the recent experimental progress @xcite , optical studies of a single , resonantly driven nanostructure have become feasible .",
    "therefore , we study the simplest optical property of the system , that is , the response to a single ultrafast pulse tuned to the fundamental interband transition of the system .",
    "the analysis includes the linear regime , where the spectral properties of the optical response yield the absorption spectrum of the system , as well as the higher order contributions which are affected by the exciton - biexciton dynamics .",
    "we show that both the time - resolved signal and its frequency spectrum can show clear signatures of collective coupling to the radiation reservoir .",
    "moreover , in the realistic case of non - identical dots , the striking features related to collective radiative relaxation appear only when the inter - dot coupling is strong enough and has the `` excitation transfer '' character ( as opposed to the occupation - preserving biexciton shift ) . in this way",
    ", our results provide a sensitive test for the appearance of a specific kind of coupling between the dots .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] , we describe the system under study and define its model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : evol ] , equations describing the evolution of the optical polarization are derived .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] contains the discussion of the results .",
    "summary and final remarks are contained in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the system under study is a dqd composed of two qds placed at a distance much smaller than the relevant photon wavelength .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the ground exciton states in the two dots . due to strong electron - hole coulomb attraction ,",
    "the ` spatially direct ' states ( electron - hole pairs confined in the same dot ) have much lower energy than the ` dissociated ' states ( we do not consider external electric fields which would change this picture @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we include only the ` spatially direct ' states in our model .",
    "we assume also that the polarization of the laser pulse corresponds to a polarization eigenstate of the excitons , which allows us to include only one out of the two bright states in each dot and to describe the dqd as a four level system , with the state @xmath2 representing empty dots , @xmath3 and @xmath4 denoting the single exciton states with an exciton localized in the first and in the second dot , respectively , and @xmath5 representing the `` molecular biexciton '' state , that is , the state with both dots occupied by an exciton .",
    "we denote the energies corresponding to the fundamental optical transition in the two dots by @xmath6 and allow for a coupling between the dots , whose amplitude is @xmath1",
    ". the latter may originate either from the interband dipole ( frster ) coupling between the dots @xcite or appear as an effective description of tunnel coupling if the carrier wave functions in the two dots overlap .",
    "in addition , excitons confined in the two dots interact via their static dipole moments , which shifts the energy of the biexciton state by @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the isolated dqd system is then @xmath7 the structure of energy levels is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "the two dots interact with their common radiative reservoir .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this interaction is @xmath8 with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are annihilation operators for an exciton in the first and second dot , respectively , @xmath12 is a photon wave vector , @xmath13 denotes polarizations , @xmath14 are photon annihilation and creation operators , @xmath15 is the interband dipole moment ( for simplicity equal for both qds ) , @xmath16 is a unit polarization vector , @xmath17 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath18 is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor , and @xmath19 is the normalization volume for the em modes .    finally , @xmath20 is the hamiltonian of the photon reservoir , where @xmath21 is the frequency of the photon with a wave vector @xmath12 .",
    "we will describe the evolution in a `` rotating basis '' defined by the unitary transformation @xmath22 the transformed hamiltonian is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "in this section we will describe the evolution of the dqd system after an instantaneous excitation with an ultrashort pulse .",
    "an analysis of both the time - resolved and spectrally - resolved response will be performed . in the linear response limit ,",
    "the latter provides the linear susceptibility from which the absorption spectrum can be derived .",
    "the source of the optical signal from the qd system is the electric dipole moment ( polarization ) related to the interband transition . assuming identical magnitude and orientation of the transition dipoles in both dots , the relevant ( interband ) part of the dipole moment operator can be written as @xmath26 the magnitude of the positive frequency part of the emitted coherent optical field , normalized to its initial value is , therefore , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density matrix of the four - level dqd system and @xmath29 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 are related to the coherences between the ground state and the single exciton states , hence are referred to as exciton polarizations .",
    "the other two matrix elements , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , correspond to the transition between the single exciton and biexciton states and are commonly called biexciton polarizations .",
    "an ultrafast pulse is assumed to be spectrally broad enough in order not to discriminate between the two dots in the structure . due to a small ( sub - wavelength ) distance between the dots",
    ", they can not be resolved spatially , either .",
    "therefore , the pulse induces optical polarizations symmetrically and independently in both dots . after the pulse ,",
    "the relevant elements of the density matrix have the values    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the pulse area .",
    "after this instantaneous initial excitation , the density matrix evolves according to the liouville ",

    "it can be noted that , from the formal point of view , the evolution equation ( [ lind ] ) is not unique .",
    "in fact , a standard microscopic derivation @xcite involves grouping the transitions into sets characterized by the values of the transition energies and , therefore , produces two different lindblad equations , depending on the arbitrary classification of the two radiating systems as `` identical '' or `` different '' .",
    "therefore , it does not provide any means for the study of the transition from the independent decay to the collective regime as the transition energy mismatch @xmath39 is varied from zero to a finite value . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ lind ] ) , composed of the unitary and dissipative parts , is compatible with the wigner - weisskopf description of the double qd system @xcite , where the markov approximation is performed without any arbitrariness ( assuming @xmath40 , so that the reservoir spectral density does not vary considerably over the relevant frequency range ) .",
    "note that the collective coupling of the two dots to the electromagnetic field , as described by eq .",
    "( [ liouv ] ) , results in the appearance of cross - terms of the form @xmath41 , @xmath42 , which are absent in the case of individual coupling to separate reservoirs ( see appendix ) .",
    "these terms correspond to the imaginary part of the coupling that appears in other approaches @xcite .",

    "become important only when the energy mismatch falls below the absorption line width .",
    "the decay of the polarization then evolves from damped oscillations ( beats ) for different dots to a superradiant exponential decay for identical dots . for very similar dots the corresponding absorption line",
    "is composed of two lorentzians superposed at the same transition frequency , with the same amplitude but different widths and opposite signs .",
    "coupling between the dots changes this picture considerably .",
    "now superradiance effects can be observed as long as the energy mismatch is smaller or comparable to the coupling strength .",
    "the envelope of the optical beats in this case decays with the usual rate for different dots and with the double ( superradiant ) rate when the coupling becomes much larger than the energy mismatch . in the intermediate range ,",
    "the decay is composed of two exponential components .",
    "these effects in the time - resolved optical response are reflected in the absorption spectrum , where the lines corresponding to the small and large components in the optical response loose or gain , respectively , their widths ( reflecting the sub- and superradiance property ) .",
    "this presents a clear difference with respect to the ( hypothetical ) case of dots emitting to different reservoirs where the lines loose or gain amplitude , while their widths remain constant .",
    "this essentially different form of absorption lines which , for sufficiently strongly coupled dots , can be observed even for a transition energy mismatch in the range of milli - electron - volts provides an experimentally accessible signature of coupling and collective decoherence in double quantum dots .",
