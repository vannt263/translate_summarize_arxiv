    "if two superconductors are weakly coupled and have a phase difference @xmath2 that is not @xmath3 or @xmath4 , a zero - voltage supercurrent flows from one to the other usually at a rate proportional to @xmath5 , as predicted by josephson @xcite in 1962 for the case of junction consisting of an insulating oxide layer between two identical superconductors .",
    "a dc supercurrent can flow through such junction in the absence of a voltage difference between both superconductors in such a way that @xmath6    after the discovery of the josephson effect , it became clear that , apart from an insulating tunnel structure ( sis ) , any sufficiently short localized weak link such as a very short constriction in the cross - section of a superconductor , a point contact between two superconductors , as well as two superconductors separated by a thin layer of normal metal , could be used as a josephson junction , obeying the current - phase relations , usually different from ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "this fact forced licharev @xcite and waldram @xcite to dwell upon a broad minded definition : a weak link is supposed to show a josephson behavior if the supercurrent - phase relation is a single - valued and analytical function , which can be represented as a fourier series @xmath7    the crossover between an ideal josephson behavior and an uniform superconducting flow was studied by solving exactly the usual ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equation for a 1-d superconductor in the presence of an effective @xmath8-function potential of arbitrary strength ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
