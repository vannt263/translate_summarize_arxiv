    "standard general relativity ( gr ) is trivial in two dimensions .",

    "the interest in 2d gravity is strongly supported by the fact that usual four - dimensional gr , in the case of spherical symmetry , is described by an effective 2d gravitational model of the dilaton type .",
    "such a dimensional reduction provides a technical tool for the study of long standing problems in black hole physics , including an understanding of the final state of a black hole with an account of the back reaction of the quantum evaporation process , see @xcite . on the other hand , lower  dimensional black hole physics",

    "the approaches @xcite-@xcite are attempts to construct string theories with a dynamical geometry @xcite-@xcite,@xcite . in this paper we present an overview of the black hole solutions in classical two  dimensional pgg . at the same time , 2d gravity is of interest in itself as a theoretical laboratory which offers a simple way to study difficult non - perturbative quantization problems @xcite .    in the studies of both , classical and quantized 2d models , it is of crucial importance to find exact solutions of the field equations .",
    "here we describe an elegant method developed in @xcite-@xcite with the help of which one can explicitly integrate the field equations of classical pgg with and without matter sources .",
    "the central point is to use a specific coframe built up from the one  form of the torsion trace and its hodge dual .",
    "the early proofs of the integrability of the _ quadratic _ pgg models in vacuum were based on the component approach and relied on specific gauge choices , like the conformal or the light - cone gauge @xcite-@xcite . the coupling to gauge , scalar , and spinor matter fields",
    "was shown to destroy the integrability in general .",
    "a peculiar but common feature of the _ standard _ matter sources ( gauge , scalar , and spinor fields ) in two dimensions is that for all of them the spin current vanishes .",
    "thus , quite generally , the lorentz connection is explicitly decoupled from 2d matter . hence the material energy ",
    "momentum current is symmetric and covariantly conserved with respect to the riemannian connection .",
