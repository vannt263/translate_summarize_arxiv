    "rayleigh  bnard convection is very rich in nature . it has been a source of inspiration in studies of universality in the route to turbulence @xcite . at the same time , there have been extensive researches both experimental and theoretical on turbulent states of convection @xcite .",
    "recently , convection turbulence has attracted attention as a good example of active scalar systems .",
    "one interesting observation is scaling behavior of structure functions of temperature , active scalar . in this context , a two - dimensional boussinesq convection model has been studied by direct numerical simulations ( dns ) in a doubly periodic square domain .",
    "the results indicate that the scaling exponents of the temperature structure functions saturate as the order goes to infinity @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that coherent structures like plumes or sharp interfaces ( shocks ) between hot and cold regions can play an important role in this behavior .",
    "moreover it is shown phenomenologically @xcite and numerically @xcite that the temperature variance ( entropy @xcite ) cascades from larger scales to smaller scales in the turbulent two - dimensional boussinesq system ( referred to as two - dimensional free convection , 2dfc ) when the turbulent state is maintained by a large scale temperature forcing . however , the relation between the entropy cascade and the dynamics of coherent structures , if any at all , is still far from understood .    in the three - dimensional navier - stokes ( 3dns )",
    "turbulence , vortical fine coherent structures , so - called worms , are observed .",
    "these worms are well known to be approximated locally by the burgers vortex tube . in this sense ,",
    "2dfc turbulence is quite similar to 3dns turbulence , although the former is more feasible than the latter .",
    "we expect that the understanding of the former may help us understand the latter and also elucidate the universal characteristics of turbulence .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to explain some properties of the long - lived coherent structures observed in dns in terms of a class of steady solutions of 2dfc . for this",
    "we search for steady solutions to the incompressible two - dimensional boussinesq approximation equations without mean temperature gradient ( 2dfc ) : @xmath3 here @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the molecular diffusivity , the mean density of the fluid ( we take @xmath5 to be unity for simplicity ) , the thermal expansion coefficient , the gravitational acceleration and the kinematic viscosity , respectively . the vector @xmath9 is the unit vector in the direction opposite to the gravity . in dns of free convection turbulence , to keep the system statistically stationary , a large - scale forcing term is added to eq.([e : temp0 ] ) , but the details are not mentioned here .    in the turbulent temperature field , long - lived sharp interfaces between hot and cold regions , i.e. shock fronts are often formed and regarded as coherent structures .",
    "thus coherent structures are highly elongated ; the typical length is the order of the integral scale and the typical width the order of ten times of kolmogorov dissipation length scale .",
    "we expect that steady solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ e : temp0])-([e : incomp0 ] ) have common properties with the coherent structures formed spontaneously in dns .    to deal with temperature shocks more directly ,",
    "we use the following vector quantity @xcite : @xmath10 we call @xmath11 t - vorticity .",
    "t - vorticity obeys the following evolution equation similar to the three - dimensional vorticity equation : @xmath12 thus t - vorticity is expected to play an essential role in turbulence like vorticity in 3dns .",
    "in contrast with t - vorticity , the governing equation for the vorticity @xmath13 in 2dfc can be written @xmath14 here @xmath15 denotes taking the @xmath16-component .",
    "note that because of the buoyancy term , i.e. the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([e : omega0 ] ) , vorticity is not a conservative quantity even for @xmath17 . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume @xmath18 , i.e. prandtl number @xmath19 here .    in the following sections , we look for steady solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ e : chi0 ] ) and ( [ e : omega0 ] ) , where the flow is decomposed into the external part given by a stream function @xmath0 and a response to it . in section ii , we deal with the case @xmath20 , i.e. a stagnation flow . in section iii ,",
    "extended stagnation flows , @xmath21 , are considered , where we show two examples of @xmath22 .",
    "the realizability of the extended external flow is discussed .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section  [ s : cr ] .",
    "we assume that the system ( [ e : chi0 ] ) and ( [ e : omega0 ] ) is exposed to a stagnation flow @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a positive constant so that we take the directions of contraction and expansion as @xmath25-axis and @xmath26-axis , respectively .",
    "the angle between @xmath25-axis and @xmath9 is also a parameter and denoted by @xmath27 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : coord ] .",
    "then the unit vector @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ e : temp0 ] ) is given in this coordinate as @xmath28 .",
    "we use this coordinate throughout this paper .",
    "65 10 coordinate setting    we further assume the following forms of the temperature and velocity fields : @xmath29 in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , t - vorticity and vorticity are expressed as @xmath32 consequently , eqs .",
    "( [ e : chi0 ] ) and ( [ e : omega0 ] ) are reduced to the following ordinary differential equations : @xmath33 after integrating once , eq.([e : steady_eq_chi ] ) can be written @xmath34 here @xmath35 is an integration constant .",
    "let us consider the general boundary conditions at the origin : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the derivatives of t - vorticity and vorticity respectively ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants .",
    "these conditions yield the relation @xmath41 . with @xmath42 the solutions to eqs.([e : steady_eq_chi ] ) and",

    "in contrast , when @xmath46 , the temperature corresponding to the solution ( [ e : gen_sol_chi ] ) diverges as @xmath47 .",
    "we then call this solution infinite temperature ( it ) type solution .",
    "we treat the two cases separately in the following subsections .",
    "let us consider the following boundary conditions : @xmath48 these conditions ( [ e : burg - bcchi ] ) and ( [ e : burg - bcomega ] ) are equivalent to @xmath44 and @xmath49 .",

    "since the temperature @xmath52 is a monotonic function , @xmath53 contains a single bump .",
    "we call this solution burgers t - vortex layer solution .    finite temperature ( ft ) solutions : the t - vorticity eq.([e : burg - sol - chi ] ) , the corresponding temperature @xmath52 and the vorticity eq .",
    "( [ e : burg - sol - omega ] ) .",
    "here we set the parameters as @xmath54 and @xmath55.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] 65 10 mono burg    now we make several remarks on the ft solutions ( [ e : burg - sol - chi ] ) and ( [ e : burg - sol - omega ] ) .",
    "first , we note that @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "that is , @xmath57 is independent of the direction of the gravity , but @xmath56 is not .",
    "this is because the former is maintained by the balance between the imposed strain and the diffusion of t - vorticity like the burgers vortex layer solution to the 3dns equations and the latter does by the balance between the diffusion of vorticity and the buoyancy induced by the temperature difference across the burgers t - vortex layer .",
    "therefore vorticity is maximized when the direction of the t - vortex layer coincides with that of the gravity .",
    "secondly , it is possible to estimate a characteristic time of the relaxation to the steady state ( [ e : burg - sol - chi ] ) after the temperature difference @xmath59 is fixed . under the stagnation flow ( [ e : burg - veldep ] ) , the time - dependent solution to eq .",

    ".   \\label{e : burg_time - dep - chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the characteristic time for the relaxation is thus estimated as @xmath61 .",
    "thirdly , the characteristic width of the bump of t - vorticity and vorticity is @xmath62 .",
    "this agrees with an observation about structures of a passive scalar advected by a two - dimensional synthetic random velocity field with a finite correlation time in ref .",
    "( of course , vorticity is not considered in that case . )",
    "although a passive scalar with non - zero mean gradient was considered , the solution ( [ e : burg - sol - chi ] ) may describe locally coherent structures of the passive scalar because of the following features : the width of those was found to scale well with @xmath63 , where @xmath64 was a root mean square of the rate of strain calculated from the low - path filtered velocity .",
    "they also showed a stagnation flow accompanied by a coherent structure in fig .",
    ".  @xcite .    finally , concerning the relevance of the ft solutions ( [ e : burg - sol - chi ] ) and ( [ e : burg - sol - omega ] ) to the coherent structures observed in dns of free convection turbulence , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite . here",
    "suffice it to say that the solutions ( [ e : burg - sol - chi ] ) and ( [ e : burg - sol - omega ] ) can give a good local approximation of the coherent structures in dns , where we compared @xmath24 with the ( positive ) eigen - value of the velocity - gradient tensor although the latter is defined only locally .    however , it is well - known that , in the limit of @xmath65 , the temperature dissipation rate per unit length along @xmath26-axis , @xmath66 , of the burgers ( ft type ) solution ( [ e : burg - sol - chi ] ) vanishes .",
    "that is , @xmath67 as @xmath65 .",
    "it suggests that this burgers layer type solution is irrelevant in this limit . in dns",
    ", however , the situation can be different because we have to consider feedback to @xmath24 ( the eigen - value of the velocity - gradient tensor ) from other ingredients of the flow .",
    "indeed , the probability distribution functions of @xmath68 obtained in dns of various @xmath4 s are observed to fall into a unique curve under a suitable normalization . in other words ,",
    "@xmath68 field may have some nontrivial dependency on @xmath4 .",
    "thus it is conjectured that the dissipation rate of the ft type solution ( [ e : burg - sol - chi ] ) , @xmath69 , would take non - zero value in the limit of vanishing diffusivity in real flows .",
    "therefore the relevance of the burgers vortex layer type solutions might not be ruled out .",
    "the detail of the observation on @xmath68 field in dns will be reported elsewhere .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the case where the temperature slowly diverges as @xmath70 , which we call infinite temperature type solutions . in terms of the boundary conditions at the origin",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath71 where @xmath46 .",
    "we set @xmath72 to examine an it type solution solely .",
    "the general solutions ( [ e : sol_chi_gen ] ) and ( [ e : sol_omega_gen ] ) then take the form : @xmath73 the boundary conditions for the vorticity ( [ e : itd_bc_omega ] ) and ( [ e : itd_bc_domega ] ) are chosen to involve only the buoyancy effect on vorticity since we focus on the vortical structure induced by the buoyancy .",
    "it should be noted that the homogeneous solutions of eq.([e : steady_eq_omega ] ) are neglected .",
    "we plot the it solutions : t - vorticity eq.([e : sol - dbs - chi ] ) , the corresponding temperature @xmath52 and vorticity eq.([e : sol - dbs - omega ] ) in fig .",
    "[ f : non - monoburg ] .",
    "65 10 nonmono - burg    it should be noted that unlike the burgers type solutions t - vorticity and vorticity of it type solutions take the same sign around @xmath74-bumps .",
    "this behavior seems to contradict physical intuition that hot fluid rises and then vorticity with the sign opposite to that of t - vorticity is induced .",
    "65 10 balance    however , vorticity is maintained by the balance between the buoyancy and not only the diffusion of vorticity but the vorticity transfer by a stagnation flow .",
    "in fact , if vorticity takes non - zero value with the same sign of t - vorticity , say positive , at infinity , vorticity flux @xmath75 through a region with the width @xmath76 centered at some point , e.g. @xmath77 , always increases vorticity in the region .",
    "the substantial increase in vorticity @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 where the first term in the r.h.s balances with the vorticity flux in @xmath26 and the second term does with @xmath80 if @xmath81 is negligible in eq.([e : steady_eq_omega ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : balance ] .",
    "that is , vorticity induced by the buoyancy cancels out the excess of the vorticity flux . on the other hand ,",
    "if the sign of vorticity around infinity is oppose to that of t - vorticity , the excess of the vorticity flux can not be canceled out by the vorticity induced by the buoyancy so that the vorticity is not kept steady .",
    "when vorticity is localized around the origin , i.e , vanishes rapidly as @xmath25 goes to infinity , the vorticity transfer is turned off and the vorticity induced by the buoyancy works as the vorticity input which balances with the diffusion of vorticity .",
    "this means that to keep the vorticity steady , @xmath82 should be null or take the same sign as that of the t - vorticity . even in the it case , using the homogeneous solution to eq.([e : steady_eq_omega ] ) , vorticity can be localized around the origin . in fig .",
    "[ f : non - monoburg ] with dash - dotted line , we show this localized vorticity , which consists of the buoyancy - induced vorticity ( [ e : sol - dbs - omega ] ) and the homogeneous solution , @xmath83 here the value for the parameter @xmath84 is chosen to cancel out the uniform vorticity of the solution ( [ e : sol - dbs - omega ] ) .",
    "the form of this localized response vorticity matches the intuition that hot fluid goes up and cold fluid down .",
    "such a localized vorticity structure associated with t - vorticity structure is one of the striking features of active scalar turbulence .    for any non - vanishing value of @xmath85 , @xmath53 is an odd function having a double bump and consequently the temperature @xmath86 forms a ridge .",
    "such temperature ridges are often observed in dns .",
    "however , far away from the origin , temperature diverges logarithmically .",
    "we think that the divergence at infinite distances is not necessarily pathological , since we are interested only in the local behavior of the structures ( around the origin ) .",
    "furthermore , this divergence prevents the strain of the external flow from squashing the temperature ridge . like the ft type",
    ", the typical width of the vorticity structure is estimated as @xmath87 .",
    "it is noted that this it solution ( [ e : sol - dbs - chi ] ) is also the burgers vortex layer solution to the three - dimensional barotoropic vorticity equation .",
    "( recall that the governing equation ( [ e : chi0 ] ) for @xmath11 is the same as that of three - dimensional barotropic vorticity . )",
    "in this section , we consider the following external flow : @xmath88 where @xmath22 is a function satisfying a condition mentioned later .",
    "when @xmath20 , this flow becomes a stagnation flow .",
    "a major difference from the @xmath2 cases is that the external flow ( [ e : ext1-psi ] ) has in general non - zero vorticity , @xmath89 thus @xmath90 should satisfy the vorticity equation .",
    "we will discuss the realizability of ( [ e : ext1-psi ] ) in detail later in this section .    under the extended stagnation flow ( [ e : ext1-psi ] )",
    ", we further assume functional forms of temperature and velocity as follows : @xmath91 then @xmath11 and the total vorticity @xmath92 are given by @xmath93 we call @xmath94 response vorticity . the velocity field eq .",

    "are easily obtained for any @xmath22 as follows : @xmath96 the last two terms of eq.([e : ext1-sol - tomega ] ) represent the vorticity induced by the buoyancy .",
    "now we discuss the realizability of the external flow ( [ e : ext1-psi ] ) . if we claim that eq .",
    "( [ e : ext1-omega ] ) is a steady solution of the barotropic two - dimensional vorticity equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "then the equation for @xmath22 is @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the @xmath101-th order derivative .",
    "equation ( [ e : ext1-eqf ] ) has been studied by many authors as a model of a flow near a rigid wall @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors , who were interested in the finite time blow - up of the solution , dealt with the time - dependent stream function @xmath102 in a bounded domain and discussed asymptotic behavior ( @xmath103 ) of the solution to the equation for @xmath104 , the proudman - johnson equation @xcite .",
    "they showed that every solution decays to zero as @xmath103 with homogeneous boundary conditions .    here instead of solving eq .",
    "( [ e : ext1-eqf ] ) , we examine the realizability of the external field ( [ e : ext1-psi ] ) .",
    "we do not think that the flow ( [ e : ext1-psi ] ) should be an exact solution of the vorticity equation ( [ e : eq - omega ] ) .",
    "rather , we assume that the flow ( [ e : ext1-psi ] ) is formed by a larger scale flow in the turbulence field .",
    "that is , from a practical point of view , a steady solution subjected to an external flow is no more than a local model of coherent structures in the turbulent field , so that the external flow need not satisfy eq.([e : eq - omega ] ) .",
    "thus it may be possible to add an forcing term describing an effect of the larger scale motions to eq.([e : eq - omega ] ) . denoting the forcing term by @xmath105 , the equation for @xmath90 ( or @xmath22 )",
