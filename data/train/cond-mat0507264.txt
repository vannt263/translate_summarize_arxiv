    "how can we experimentally determine the relevant energy levels and the tunneling rates involved in electronic transport through single molecule devices ? such questions are of fundamental interest for the development of molecular electronics .",
    "the conductance of single molecules has been investigated in several experiments where phenomena such as coulomb blockade and kondo effect @xcite , negative differential resistance @xcite and logic gates @xcite were pointed out .",
    "different techniques were used to address single or a few molecules .",
    "fixed contact arrangements such as nanopore systems @xcite and nanogaps fabricated by shadow evaporation or electromigration @xcite have been realized . alternatively ,",
    "scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) @xcite and break junction techniques @xcite offer tunable contacts to characterize molecules .",
    "break junctions offer an additional stability when compared to the stm , but the implementation of a third electrode remains delicate although recent work shows it can be done @xcite . adding a chemically controllable environment in break junctions experiments would provide an additional control of the anchoring of the molecule to the metallic constriction and allow _ in situ _ electrochemistry experiments . the excellent efficiency of a liquid gate bas been demonstrated previously on carbon nanotube field - effect transistors @xcite , and recently this effect has been studied for organic molecules using a stm  @xcite .",
    "buckminsterfullerenes and in particular c@xmath0 and its derivatives have attracted much attention @xcite and , due to their particular electronic properties , represent ideal model systems for molecular electronics @xcite . in this letter , we present electronic transport measurements through thiolated c@xmath0 derivatives in a two probe configuration provided by the tips of a break junction ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the single functional group serves as an anchor and , in the case where a single molecule junction is realized , permits to control the coupling of the c@xmath0 to a au electrode by mechanically adjusting the inter - electrode spacing @xmath1 . by performing the transport measurements in two distinct solvents , dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) and toluene",
    ", we could observe the strong influence of the environment on the molecular junctions .",
    "the synthesis of the fullerene derivative was carried out following well - established protocols @xcite .",
    "a thiolated c4 linker ensured that the c@xmath0 molecule would bind to the gold electrodes . to contact the molecules and perform transport measurements",
    ", we used a mechanically controllable break junction setup @xcite .",
    "a gold nanobridge was lithographically patterned on a phosphor bronze substrate . by bending the substrate via a vertically moving rod ,",
    "the gold bridge is elongated and finally breaks .",
    "the two resulting ends serve as electrodes for contacting the molecules .",
    "the setup includes a cell that allows working in different liquid environments and has been described previously @xcite .",
    "we first characterized the gold junctions via measurements of the conductance @xmath2 versus distance @xmath1 in air and in the solvents used subsequently for the c@xmath0 molecules , toluene and dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) .",
    "several sets of consecutive open - close cycles were recorded , with @xmath3 ranging typically between and a few @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the conductance quantum . to investigate the transport through c@xmath0 molecules , a c@xmath0 solution was added to the liquid cell while the junction was kept close .",
    "the junction was then opened widely to favor the self - assembly of the molecules .",
    "we also added molecules while keeping the junction open but no significant differences in the transport measurements were observed .",
    "sets of @xmath6 @xmath2 curves were recorded at time intervals of . during these cycles ,",
    "the junction was never fully closed , keeping its conductance below in order to limit mechanical rearrangements of the au tips .",
    "@xmath2-values obtained while closing the junction are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] for dmso ( a ) and toluene ( b ) at a bias voltage of .",
    "the open symbol curves show measurements in the pure solvent .",
    "the solid curves are five successive raw measurements performed after adding the c@xmath0 solution to the junction .",
    "we also attempted to measure current - voltage ( @xmath7 ) characteristics .",
    "however , these curves were not reproducible , displaying rather large uncontrolled hysteresis , which we assign to the dynamics of the liquid environment and the relatively weak tethering of the c@xmath0 with one single linker group only .    while the measurements of @xmath2 in the pure solvents show a clean exponential behavior @xcite , the curves for the c@xmath0 modified junctions exhibit a more complex structure .",
    "in previous break - junction work with molecules , the occurrence of a plateau in @xmath2 has been taken as the signature for the ` locking - in ' of a molecule  @xcite .",
    "we observe a plateau in about @xmath8 of the measured closing cycles .",
    "in addition to this observation , a pronounced peak can appear ( arrows in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "though , the peak appears less frequently in different samples , reproducible measurements ( visible in each closing curve within a cycle of @xmath9 curves at least ) could be acquired for both c@xmath0 in dmso and toluene . in dmso , the peak corresponds to a conductance maximum of and is followed by a plateau - like feature .",
    "when further closing the junction the conductance rises more rapidly , although less sharply than in the pure solvent .",
    "the shape of the conductance curves in toluene ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) is very different , showing more noise and a fully developed peak .",
    "after a small pre - peak ( not present in all curves ) , the conductance rises to a maximum value of @xmath10 at the peak and decays again to a very low conductance .",
    "while further closing the junction the conductance increases sharply , with a slope similar to that of the conductance in the pure solvent .",
    "the environment in which the junction is studied plays clearly an important role here .",
    "we note in particular that dmso is a rather poor solvent for neutral fullerenes whereas toluene is a good one ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to calibrate each junction , we measured the tunneling conductance between the two au electrodes in the pure solvent .",
    "let us denote the gap distance between the two au electrodes by @xmath11 .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the vertical displacement of the pushing rod and @xmath14 the reduction factor which depends on the geometry of the junction @xcite .",
    "it is the reduction factor @xmath14 which needs to be calibrated for each junction .",
    "the tunneling conductance @xmath15 measured in a pure solvent was fitted according to the expression @xmath16 $ ] with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( and @xmath19 ) represents the height of a square tunneling barrier of width @xmath11 and @xmath20 is the electron mass .",
    "the fits were adjusted by tuning @xmath14 in order to obtain values for @xmath18 in agreement with our previous work @xcite in which the apparent workfunctions in different solvents were calibrated with respect to measurements in vacuum .",
    "the reference inverse decay lengths @xmath19 , valid for the pure solvents , are and .",
    "this procedure provides the reduction factor @xmath14 for each junction measured .",
    "the particularity of our system lies in the single anchor group used to tether the molecule within the break junction .",
    "this configuration makes it possible to tune the coupling of the molecule to the electrode : while one tunneling rate ( @xmath21 ) is fixed , the second ( @xmath22 ) varies exponentially with the gap between the electrode ( electrode to the right in fig .  [ figure1 ] ) and the c@xmath0 molecule . the metal  molecule ",
    "metal junction forms a double - barrier junction . in this picture , the observed conductance peaks can be explained within a coherent resonant tunneling model , provided that one of the energy levels of the molecule lies not too far away from the fermi level of the electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]a ) .",
    "resonant tunneling through a single level @xmath23 results in a peak in the linear conductance @xmath3 when the level aligns with the fermi level @xmath24 of the leads , i.e. at @xmath25 .",
    "the occurrence of a peak in @xmath26 is a well known fact @xcite .",
    "however , a peak can also arise in @xmath27 , even if @xmath28 .",
    "resonant tunneling is described by the breit - wigner equation :    @xmath29    in our geometry , @xmath30 is fixed and defined by the molecular tether holding the molecule to the left electrode ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . @xmath31 depends exponentially on the distance @xmath1 between the c@xmath0 molecule and the right electrode with @xmath19 being the inverse decay length , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) as a function of @xmath31 has a maximum @xmath33 at @xmath34 . for @xmath35 we would have @xmath36 and consequently a peak conductance of @xmath37 . in the experiment , the peak conductance is however much smaller than @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 .",
    "it follows then that @xmath40 and @xmath41 . a respective plot in this limit ( @xmath42 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b .",
    "note , that we define @xmath43 , but the sign of @xmath23 is not determined , i.e. a sign change in @xmath23 does not affect the discussion .    using the breit - wigner equation",
    "we can obtain the ratio @xmath44 from the measured peak height without fitting .",
    "the measurements yield @xmath45 in dmso and @xmath46 in toluene , more than twice the dmso value . because we expect @xmath47 to be the same for both solvents ( after all it is the same linker )",
    ", this suggests that the level is lying closer to the fermi level of the electrodes in toluene as compared to dmso .    that we can measure directly the ratio @xmath44 is a very nice fact .",
    "but we would like to obtain both @xmath23 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is at first sight not possible , because eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) is scale - invariant .",
    "changing @xmath47 , @xmath31 , and @xmath23 by the same factor leaves the curve invariant . to our rescue",
    ", we emphasize that we did not measure the linear - response conductance , but @xmath3 at a bias of , much larger than @xmath48 at room temperature .",
    "the finite bias introduces an energy scale which allows a considerable narrowing down of the range of possible values .    integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) over the bias window , given by the applied voltage @xmath49 , yields : @xmath50\\ ] ] all parameters are now scaled to @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "there are two regimes : a ) @xmath54 and b ) @xmath55 , the latter corresponds to the breit - wigner equation . in both cases a peak develops in @xmath56 , but there is a pronounced crossover , which sets in sharply at @xmath57 .",
    "this crossover is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3]c for a selected value of @xmath58 . in the following",
    ", we will try to fit our measurements to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) in both the low and large @xmath23 limit .",
    "there are four fitting parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath47 , @xmath59 , and @xmath19 .",
    "note , that we always use the ansatz @xmath60 and that we define the zero of the distance axis @xmath1 to match with the peak position in the measurement .",
    "this is possible , as we have no means to determine the ` true ' zero , i.e. the point of contact of the right electrode with the c@xmath0 molecule .    in the first step ,",
    "we obtain @xmath19 by focussing on large @xmath1 where the junction is widely open and the conductance well below the conductance at the peak .",
    "in this simple tunneling regime , @xmath61 . from fits to the averaged conductance curves of the c@xmath0-modified junctions ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] insets ) , we extract the inverse decay lengths @xmath62@xmath63 and @xmath64@xmath63 .",
    "we emphasize that the value obtained for dmso is more reliable than the one for toluene , since the fit could be performed over a more extended range of conductance .",
    "this is due to the presence of a lower conductance peak in toluene ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) .",
    "the inverse decay lengths @xmath19 are slightly suppressed as compared to the values measured in the solvent alone @xcite .",
    "we next compare our data to conductance curves calculated in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "we fix the @xmath19 values to the ones determined for large @xmath1 and try to obtain a good match with the experiment by tuning both @xmath47 and @xmath59 . the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] show curves for @xmath65mev and @xmath66mev , and @xmath67mev , @xmath68mev . in both cases ,",
    "the adjusted curves present a substantially broader peak than the data , showing that the limit @xmath25 is inappropriate .",
    "we now relax the condition @xmath69 and try to find the _",
    "smallest _ possible @xmath23 for which a good match between the calculated and measured curve is obtained , again using the @xmath19 values determined for a large @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain @xmath70ev , @xmath71mev , @xmath72ev , and @xmath73ev , @xmath74mev , @xmath75mev .",
    "care has to be taken at this point , because is very close to the transition region between the breit - wigner and the @xmath25 case where the theoretical @xmath2 curves are quite sensitive to the temperature . when taking the finite temperature into account , @xmath76 slightly increases , so that is a good approximation for both dmso and toluene",
    "if we allow for larger values of @xmath23 we cross over to the breit - wigner equation .",
    "in this scale - invariant limit , we obtain convincing fits for both dmso and toluene with the parameters @xmath77 ( dmso ) and @xmath78 ( toluene ) , and @xmath79 as required ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) . hence ,",
    "at this stage we can say with confidence that for both dmso and toluene .",
    "as emphasized before , the breit - wigner formula can not provide an upper bound for @xmath23 .",
    "however , we can  on a physical ground ",
    "provide an upper bound on @xmath31 and therefore also on @xmath23 .",
    "the latter is obtained through the relation @xmath80 .",
    "the peak in @xmath27 appears at relatively large @xmath31 values , but @xmath31 can not grow to too high values , because otherwise _ higher _ molecular states of the c@xmath0 molecule will strongly hybridize with the states in the au electrode and the model will break down .",
    "moreover , a large @xmath31 at short distances corresponds to a large binding force of order @xmath81 between the molecule and the au electrode .",
    "in fact , we think that the crossover from the peak to the plateau in dmso is determined by this consideration .",
    "furthermore , the fully developed peak in toluene suggests that @xmath31 at the position of the peak ( @xmath59 ) is smaller in toluene than in dmso .    in order to fix the upper bound of @xmath31 we need to discuss the typical energy scales of the orbitals in c@xmath0 @xcite . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] we show the energy levels of c@xmath0 and c@xmath82 ( adapted from green _ et al . _",
    "the homo - lumo gap of c@xmath0 determined in solution is around @xcite whereas local density approximation calculations provide a value of for the free c@xmath0 molecule ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "experiments on c@xmath0 monolayers assembled on metallic surfaces showed values ranging from to @xcite .    due to its high electronegativity ,",
    "a c@xmath0 molecule in contact with a metal tends to gain charge from the metal .",
    "the ionization potential of au is and the electron affinity of c@xmath0 equals .",
    "the latter includes the coulomb energy of the singly charged c@xmath0 amounting to .",
    "if we assume that the coulomb energy is strongly screened in the gap between the au electrodes , c@xmath83c@xmath82 is favorable .",
    "photoemission studies of c@xmath0 on a au surface yield values for the electron charge on c@xmath0 of @xmath84 @xcite and @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "hence , it is very likely that c@xmath0 is singly charged also in our work . on acquiring an electron the threefold",
    "degenerate lumo state of c@xmath0 splits by a very small amount of ( not shown and also not resolvable in our experiment ) and the chemical potential @xmath24 is expected to align closely with this orbital ( dashed line ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath24 may lie above ( @xmath86 ) or below ( @xmath87 ) , depending on the exact charge state .    taking the homo - lumo gap of the c@xmath0 and the c@xmath0 anion as the proper energy scales , to avoid hybridization with higher lying orbitals . if we impose that this condition occurs in dmso at the transition from the peak to the observed plateau at ( see arrow in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) , we obtain . together with the previous consideration , @xmath23 is determined quite accurately to .",
    "similarly , if we pretend to describe the full peak in toluene up to ( arrow ) , we obtain .",
    "these rather small values for @xmath23 are inconsistent with the previous consideration . in order to obtain an upper bound for @xmath76 of at least",
    ", one would have to set the cut - off to as large a value as .",
    "this disagreement shows that the full decay of @xmath2 in toluene to approximately zero conductance beyond the peak must have another origin .",
    "this will be addressed in the following .",
    "we have assumed here that we are allowed the use the resonant tunneling model with an unperturbed level beyond the peak .",
    "however , a full understanding of the small @xmath1 regime would require the understanding of local rearrangement effects taking place when the electrodes and the molecules are reaching mechanical contact .",
    "in the case of toluene we observe that the conductance drops to a negligibly small value after the peak and then shows a pronounced increase , similarly to the behavior of the junction in the pure solvent ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) .",
    "we can presume that , upon closing of the junction to small values of @xmath1 , the molecules are pushed away from the inter - electrode space , resulting in conductance properties dominated by au - au tunneling .",
    "the shoulder observed in the case of dmso ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]a ) lets envision a different scenario in which the molecules remain within the junction and therefore continue to substantially affect the conductance of the junction at very short inter - electrode separations .",
    "additionally , large conductance fluctuations can be observed in toluene ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) while the curves are much smoother in dmso .",
    "we attribute these differences to the solubility of the fullerene derivative in the solvent considered .",
    "whereas toluene is a good solvent , the fullerenes tend to aggregate with time when suspended in dmso . in our view",
    ", the large conductance fluctuations observed in toluene reflect the tendency of the fullerene molecules to be re - solved if the cavity is getting to narrow .",
    "in contrast , the molecules rather stay within the junction if dmso is used due to the lower solvation energy .",
    "whether a single molecule picture really holds in such a system is an important question .",
    "the very good match between theory and experiment supports the single molecule approach . the analysis provides more than a qualitative agreement with the data and allows the extraction of narrowed range estimates for the lumo position and the tunneling rate @xmath47 of the molecular bridge between the au electrode and the c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the results are : , and .",
    "the above discussion is based on a non - interacting model , where the interaction energy has been absorbed in the level energy @xmath23 .",
    "when the coupling @xmath31 to the molecule changes , the average charge on the molecule is modified , thereby changing the interaction contribution to @xmath23 .",
    "however , we have numerically checked ( within a self - consistent mean field theory @xcite ) that this effect does not appreciably change the shape of the conductance versus distance curves , but only slightly scales the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath47 and @xmath59 .",
    "the presence of a much lower peak in some raw conductance curves in toluene ( about prior to the main peak , fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) might be a signature for a weaker tunneling process involving c@xmath0 molecules on both electrodes . if running experiments confirm this feature , an interpretation in terms of a triple - barrier system could further support this approach .",
    "we have performed transport measurements through c@xmath0 molecules tethered by a single anchor group in au break junctions operated in a liquid environment .",
    "the signature of the presence of the molecules within the junction appeared as a peak in conductance versus distance curves .",
    "the shape of this peak was strongly influenced by the solvent in which the junction was operated , thereby showing the importance of a proper environmental control in nanoscale junctions .",
    "the data can be understood in a resonant tunneling picture through a single level located close to the fermi energy @xmath24 .",
    "the particular geometry of the experiment combined with the environmental control allowed us to provide numbers for the electronic tunneling rates between a gold electrode and a fullerene derivative . by systematically varying the linker group ,",
    "our approach will allow to better understand the electronic coupling between molecules and electrodes in molecular devices .",
    "moreover , gating will allow the resonant level to be moved even closer to the fermi level .",
