    "all data were reduced using spextool version 3.3 @xcite using standard settings ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .    in order to assign an infrared spectral type to sdss 1416 + 13 , we calculated several spectral indices from the literature , shown in table  [ tab : irt ] .",
    "the resulting spectral types vary from l2 to l6 with a mean classification of l4@xmath01.5 .",
    "the variation is not surprising due to the peculiar colors of sdss 1416 + 13 , but the earlier near - infrared type compared to the optical classification is unusual , given that most blue l dwarfs are classified @xmath92 subtypes later in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : spex ] shows the comparison of the near - infrared spectrum of sdss 1416 + 13 to l4 and l5 spectral standards .",
    "while the region between 1.1 and 1.3 @xmath29 m ( na i and k i doublets ) shows a good match to the l4 standard , the overall spectral slope of sdss 1416 + 13 is too blue to match either of the spectral standards .",
    "some unusually blue l dwarfs have been resolved as l dwarf plus t dwarf binaries , the t dwarf component contributing weak absorption features and making the spectral slope bluer @xcite . in figure",

    "while the match of the spectral slope is better than for the l4 and l5 dwarfs , sdss 1416 + 13 does not show any evidence of ch@xmath30 in the @xmath31 band , which is typically present in composite l dwarf / t dwarf spectra .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the blue color is due to unresolved binarity , although high resolution imaging to test this conjecture is warranted .    the cross - dispersed spectrum of sdss 1416 + 13 is shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig : spex ] .",
    "equivalent widths of the k i doublets at @xmath32 1.175 @xmath29 m and @xmath32 1.245 @xmath29 m are given in table  [ tab : ew ] .",
    "the uncertainties were calculated by propagating the error in flux and the standard deviation of the continuum regions . sdss 1416 + 13 has strong alkali absorption , with ew that are comparable to typical values for l4/l5 dwarfs measured at comparable resolution @xcite .      to calculate the proper motion of sdss 1416 + 13 , we combined the sdss and 2mass coordinates with three positions from the supercosmos sky survey @xcite .",
    "a fit to the five epochs gives @xmath33 = 0.0880 @xmath0 0.0028 yr@xmath27 and @xmath34 = 0.1399 @xmath0 0.0013 yr@xmath27 with a total baseline of 49.07  years and uncertainties based on the scatter in the fit to right ascension and declination .",
    "the proper motion is remarkably small for an l dwarf within 10  pc of the sun , and explains why this object has not been found in proper motion surveys to recover nearby ultracool dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radial velocity of sdss 1416 + 13 was calculated by measuring the line centers of the atomic lines rb i ( 7802.41 and 7949.79  ) , na i ( 8185.51 and 8197.08  ) and cs i ( 8523.47 and 8945.93",
    " ) in the mage spectrum .",
    "the resulting line measurements were averaged to obtain a radial velocity of -42.2@xmath05.1 km s@xmath27 ( corrected to a solar frame of reference ) .",
    "the uncertainty reflects the scatter in the six line velocities .",
    "_ uvw _ velocities and uncertainties were calculated using the method outlined in @xcite and are given in table  [ tab : prop ] , corrected to the local standard of rest assuming @xmath35 = ( -10,5,7 ) km s@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we define positive @xmath36 as toward the galactic center .",
    "sdss 1416 + 13 meets the kinematic criteria for young - old disk membership , with @xmath37 velocities just outside the young disk ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "an integration of the orbit of sdss 1416 + 13 in the galactic potential ( after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that it is nearly circular , with the object traveling up to 500  pc above and below the plane of the galaxy during its orbital period .",
    "the kinematics of this source are consistent with its interpretation as a ( possibly older ) thin disk star , most likely with a stellar mass ( m @xmath6 0.077 m@xmath14 for age @xmath13 5 gyr ) , a large surface gravity and possibly subsolar metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : col ] shows the @xmath5 and _ j@xmath1k@xmath2 _ colors of sdss 1416 + 13 compared to the median colors of all known l dwarfs based on data from the dwarf archives and @xcite according to optical spectral type ; objects with only near - infrared spectral types were excluded .",
    "while sdss 1416 + 13 is blue in _ j@xmath1k@xmath2 _ color , its @xmath5 color is normal for its spectral type .",
    "this is typical of other blue l dwarfs , which are also shown in figure  [ fig : col ] .",
    "sdss 1416 + 13 lies blueward of previous 2mass color - color selection criteria .",
    "initially , @xcite selected for dwarfs with @xmath38 , in order to increase the sample of the latest l dwarfs . to construct the luminosity function from the 20  pc sample , @xcite and @xcite created a color criteria in the @xmath24 vs. @xmath39 color magnitude diagram that included fainter sources if they had red colors to balance the need to obtain a complete sample with the heavy contamination by late - m dwarfs .",
    "sdss 1416 + 13 falls far from both color cuts , and all blue l dwarfs fall to the blue side of the 2mass color criteria used to assemble large samples of l dwarfs .    at a distance of 8.0@xmath01.6  pc ,",
    "sdss 1416 + 13 will contribute to the 20  pc luminosity function @xcite .",
    "its inclusion increases the number of l5 dwarfs within 20  pc from 4 to 5  a 20% increase .",
    "in addition , with an absolute magnitude of m@xmath20=13.7@xmath00.1 , it increases the number of dwarfs in the 13.5 - 14 mag bin from 6 to 7 . while the inclusion of sdss 1416 + 13 does not significantly change the shape of the luminosity function , the possible exclusion of other nearby blue l dwarfs ( as yet undiscovered ) may result in a substantial underestimate of the l dwarf space density .",
    "current surveys do not sample the entire range of possible l dwarf colors and properties , but create a sample biased towards redder @xmath39 colors ( schmidt et al .",
    "2009 , submitted ) .",
    "the discovery of sdss 1416 + 13 reinforces the need to probe the solar neighborhood for additional dwarfs using spectroscopy in addition to both optical and near - infrared photometry to mitigate selection biases .",
