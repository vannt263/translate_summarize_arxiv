    "the derivation of thermodynamics from dynamics is still an open field of investigation @xcite .",
    "hereby we focus on a related but seemingly less ambitious purpose , the derivation of fluctuation - dissipation processes from deterministic dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been recently pointed out@xcite that a genuinely dynamic derivation of brownian motion would be essentially equivalent to a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics , thereby implying that also this avenue might be fraught by strong conceptual difficulties .",
    "it has been remarked@xcite that the dynamic foundation of brownian motion , as described by an ordinary fokker - planck equation , imply fluctuations with a finite correlation time @xmath0 , namely , rests on the existence of a finite _ microscopic time _ , or , equivalently , on the microscopic foundation of the linear response theory@xcite .",
    "however , the resulting transport equation can be identified with a _ bona fide _ fokker - planck equation only if@xcite the corresponding relaxation process is exactly , not approximately , exponential : a property in harsh conflict with both quantum @xcite and classical@xcite dynamics .",
    "this is the main reason why the problem of the dynamic foundation of the ordinary fokker - planck equation is not yet settled and further efforts must be made not excluding the possibility of either non - newtonian effects @xcite or spontaneous fluctuations @xcite , both implying a kind of generalization of ordinary classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "here we reverse the perspective and rather than imposing the markovian approximation , incompatible with the deterministic nature of the system under study , we discuss the consequence of explicitly rejecting the requirement of a finite microscopic time scale . to conduct this discussion , we adopt occam s principle , namely we study the simplest dynamical system with the essential features necessary to produce a fluctuation - dissipation process without using the requirement of a finite microscopic time scale .",
    "let us consider the liouville - like equation @xmath1\\ , \\rho_{t}(x,\\xi,{\\bf w},t ) .",
    "\\label{thewholeuniverse }         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that we study for simplicity a one - dimensional case .",
    "the one - dimensional variable of interest @xmath2 undergoes the influence of a  fluctuation `` , called @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath4 is driven by the operator @xmath5 which expresses concisely the action that a set of variables @xmath6 can exert on @xmath4 so as to render disordered its time evolution .",
    "thus , in principle , the ' ' stochastic \" dynamics of @xmath2 can be either provoked by nonlinearity or by the large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the unperturbed fluctuations @xmath4 are the source of diffusion of the variable @xmath2 . to undergo also dissipation , the second key ingredient of a fluctuation - dissipation process",
    ", the variable @xmath2 must also exert a feedback on the dynamics of @xmath4 .",
    "this important property is expressed by the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath7 , left unspecified . as we shall see",
    ", we shall assume a linear departure from the unperturbed condition @xmath8 given by @xmath9 .",
    "the operator @xmath10 drives the bath response to an external perturbation@xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 denotes the strength of the feedback and the minus sign alludes to the reaction nature of the effect .",
    "pursuing our program inspired to occam s criterion , we are forced to assume the variable @xmath4 to be dichotomous",
    ". it would be surprising if @xmath4 , and so the microscopic statistics , would be gaussian . in a sense",
    ", there would be no problem to solve at all .",
    "therefore we must adopt a non gaussian statistics .",
    "thus , we fix the statistics of @xmath4 to be dichotomous , since dichotomous statistics seem to be the simplest example of non - gaussian statistics .",
    "we plan to prove that a bath , described by the unperturbed operator @xmath8 with a diverging correlation time , @xmath12 , yields a form of equilibrium strongly departing from the ordinary canonical prescription .",
    "the proof is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive a generalized master equation .",
    "we make the basic assumption that the memory kernel of this master equation only depends on the unperturbed bath dynamics . using the additional assumption that the bath response is of the same kind as that studied in earlier publications , we derive the central theoretical result of this paper . in section iii",
    "we discuss the error associated with the basic assumption of section ii . in section",
    "iv we use the central theoretical result of this paper to predict the resulting , non - canonical , equilibrium . in section",
    "v we check numerically the effect of the error discussed in section ii .",
    "finally , in section vi we make a balance of the results obtained in this paper .",
    "in the case of no feedback , namely when @xmath13 , it is shown @xcite that an immediate benefit of the dichotomous choice is that the projection operator method @xcite allows us to express the dynamics of the variable of interest , x , in terms of an exact and simple diffusion - like equation of motion .",
    "when the feedback is included , unfortunately , the projection method does not produce a simple equation of motion , and delicate assumptions must be made if we want to keep the elegance and simplicity of the earlier treatment .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to discuss these delicate assumptions .",
    "the adoption of the projection method @xcite yields for the part of interest @xmath14 of the total distribution the following equation : @xmath15         \\exp[\\hat{q}\\hat{l}\\hat{q}(t - t^{\\prime})]\\cdot\\nonumber \\\\         & &   \\hat{q }         [ -\\xi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } + \\gamma(-\\delta^{2}x ) ]         \\hat{p}\\rho_{t}(x,\\xi,{\\bf w},t^\\prime)\\big\\}\\,dt^{\\prime}.         \\label{generalizedmasterequation }         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as usual , we assume the bath to have an equilibrium distribution satisfying the condition : @xmath16 this dictates the choice of the projection operator @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is obtained tracing the total distribution @xmath20 over the irrelevant degrees of freedom @xmath4 and @xmath21 . note that eq.([generalizedmasterequation ] ) is an exact equation provided that the initial condition is given by : @xmath22 for simplicity we assume that :    @xmath23    we carry out our calculations setting the condition : @xmath24 .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming a form of linear response to external perturbation in agreement with refs .",
    "we make now the assumption that , in spite of @xmath25 , the exponential operator @xmath26 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ generalizedmasterequation ] ) only depends on the unperturbed operator @xmath27 , a property that , as earlier pointed out , is valid only in the free diffusion case .",
    "we also use eq.([equilibriumdistribution ] ) . under all these approximations , we are allowed to rewrite eq.([generalizedmasterequation ] ) as @xmath28 where @xmath29   \\exp[\\hat{\\gamma}_{0}(t - t^{\\prime})]\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\   \\hat{q}[\\,\\xi\\ , ] \\hat{p } \\rho_{t}(x,\\xi,{\\bf   w},t^{\\prime})\\big\\ }         \\label{a }         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and    @xmath30   \\exp[\\hat{\\gamma}_{0}(t - t^{\\prime})]\\cdot\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hat{q}[\\,\\hat{\\gamma}_1\\ , ] \\hat{p } \\rho_{t}(x,\\xi,{\\bf   w},t^{\\prime})\\big\\}.\\nonumber \\\\",

    "there is no error associated with this assumption , since this is shown to be an exact consequence of the dichotomous nature of the variable @xmath4 .",
    "it is not so in the more general case of this paper .",
    "we shall devote section iii and the numerical treatment of section v to assessing the consequences of the error associated with this basic assumption .",
    "adopting the formalism of the response theory@xcite we rewrite eq.([addition ] ) in the form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 this result has been obtained by evaluating the diffusion term at the zero - th order in the feedback interaction , and considering , in agreement with the linear response criterion@xcite , the first non - vanishing contribution , proportional to the friction .",
    "it is worth remarking that the correlation function of eq.([correlationfunction ] ) affords the most convenient way of defining the microscopic time @xmath0 mentioned in section 1 .",
    "this is given by : @xmath34    we now have recourse to the second approximation on which our crucial theoretical results rests . this assumption will be referred to as _ assumption ( ii ) _ and can be expressed as follows :    _ assumption(ii)_. we assume that the function @xmath35 has a finite time scale .",
    "this assumption is dictated by the theoretical and numerical conclusion of the earlier work of refs.@xcite .",
    "this assumption can not be mislead as a property of ordinary statistical mechanics .",
    "actually , this assumption means a deviation from ordinary statistical mechanics , which , as shown in ref.@xcite , would imply @xmath36 in the case where the correlation function @xmath37 is not integrable and the correlation time of eq.([correlationtime ] ) diverges , the condition of eq.([ordinarystatisticalmechanics ] ) would imply a field of finite intensity to produce a current of infinite intensity@xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations show that this striking physical condition is not realized@xcite , thereby implying a violation of eq .",
    "( [ ordinarystatisticalmechanics ] ) .",
    "this violation , in turn , is due to the fact that the function @xmath35 has a finite time scale even when the function @xmath37 does not . note that under the assumption that the function @xmath35 has a finite time scale it is possible to define @xmath38 in conclusion , we obtain the following important equation :    @xmath39    this result rests on both assumption ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "however , it is evident that special attention must be devoted to the first assumption . in a sense the validity of assumption ( ii ) has already been assessed by the theoretical and numerical work of refs.@xcite .",
    "the validity of assumption ( i ) , on the contrary , requires further discussion .",
    "this will be done in sections iii and v.    before ending this section , we want to remark that in the special case where the condition of eq.([ordinarystatisticalmechanics ] ) applies , the important result of eq.([fundamentalequation ] ) becomes very similar to the fokker - planck type of equation recently found by the authors of ref.@xcite .",
    "these authors pointed out that an equation of this kind shows that anomalous diffusion can be compatible with boltzmann statistics .",
    "we note that this conclusion does not apply to the case of super - diffusion under study in this paper , because , as we have seen , eq.([ordinarystatisticalmechanics ] ) does not apply . in the subdiffusional case studied in ref.@xcite",
    ", however , there are no compelling reasons leading to the breakdown of eq.([ordinarystatisticalmechanics ] ) thereby leaving open the possibility that the subdiffusional condition is compatible with boltzmann statistics .",
    "to a first sight , one might be led to think that eq.([fundamentalequationwithordinaryfriction ] ) is equivalent to the langevin - like equation : @xmath40 supplemented , of course , by the set of equations necessary to determine the time evolution of the dichotomous variable @xmath41 . in this section we show that eq.([fundamentalequationwithordinaryfriction ] ) is not identical to the equation of motion for @xmath19 generated by eq.([langevinequation ] ) .",
    "this will help us to estimate the error affecting the main prediction of this paper about the condition of equilibrium established by the feedback on the generator of fluctuation without time scale .      in section iv we shall point out that eq.([langevinequation ] )",

    "some years ago , the findings of zhu and robinson@xcite have been criticized by keirstad and wilson@xcite with arguments which are a nice example of the conventional wisdom .",
    "let us see why .",
    "zhu and robinson @xcite had detected significant deviations from the canonical maxwell velocity distribution , in a physical condition characterized by a system of interest very fast compared to its thermal bath .",
    "this condition seems to be related to that considered in this paper where the dynamical system playing the role of bath is in fact so slow as to break the condition itself of time scale separation .",
    "the reaction of the scientific community , of which the authors of @xcite are a significant example , has been that the non canonical behavior detected numerically by zhu and robinson @xcite is an artefact of numerical inaccuracy and limited computation time .",
    "this paper shows , on the contrary , that the opposite condition might apply , namely , that ordinary rather that anomalous statistics might be the result of numerical inaccuracy .",
    "we know that the round - off errors are equivalent to the influence of fluctuations of a given intensity @xmath90 . the larger the computer accuracy , the smaller is the intensity of the equivalent fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "we know @xcite that the effect of these fluctuations is that of changing the correlation function of eq.([correlationfunction ] ) into the correlation function @xmath91 related to the original by @xmath92 with @xmath93 proportional to @xmath94 and @xmath95 being a positive coefficient , of the order of unity , determined by the microscopic dynamics under study@xcite .",
    "it is evident that at times @xmath96 the markov approximation is valid , and as an effect of it the non standard equation of ( [ fundamentalequation ] ) becomes identical to a conventional fokker - planck equation .",
    "the non conventional equilibrium of ( [ exact ] ) is a time asymptotic property , and at any given time @xmath97 we can produce a transition from the regime of non - ordinary statistics to a regime of canonical gaussian equilibrium by increasing the intensity of the parameter @xmath90 , so as to realize the condition @xmath98 .",
    "finally , we want to stress a problem worth of future investigation .",
    "this has to do with the increasing attention devoted to the non - extensive thermodynamics of tsallis@xcite .",
    "non - extensive thermodynamics means that the deviation from the canonical equilibrium distribution is not more perceived as a violation of statistical mechanics .",
    "this is a very valuable aspect of this research work@xcite .",
    "in fact , as a result of the interest that tsallis s non - extensive statistical mechanics is raising , a deviation from the ordinary prescription , of the kind earlier mentioned , would be judged these days as a possible manifestation of non - extensive thermodynamics triggered by the long - range correlations of the dynamical system under study , rather than a consequence of numerical inaccuracy .",
    "however , the arguments of this paper show that under the specific form here adopted to establish a fluctuation - dissipation process in a case of dynamics without time scale , the basin of attraction for equilibrium distribution is given by lvy statistics .",
    "it is interesting to point out that lvy statistics share with tsallis statistics the power law behavior of the distribution tails . however , the central part of the lvy distribution significantly depart from the generalized canonical distribution of tsallis . in an earlier",
    "paper@xcite it has been shown that the adoption of tsallis non - extensive thermodynamics naturally leads , via entropy maximisation under a proper constraint , to a transition probability with an inverse power law decay at large distances . by repeated application of this kind of transition , as a consequence of the lvy - gnedenko theorem@xcite the diffusion process is attracted by the basin of lvy statistics . in the case of extremely weak friction , equilibrium is reached as a result of a very large number of elementary transitions , and this is probably the main reason why eventually the resulting statistics is of lvy rather than tsallis kind ."
