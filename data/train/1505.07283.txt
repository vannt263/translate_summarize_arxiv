    "for broadcast channels , where receivers know some part of the transmitted messages a priori , is called _ index coding _ and is well - known for noiseless binary broadcast channels  @xcite . in the case of noisy binary broadcast , the index codes of  @xcite provide equal error correcting capability at all receivers and exploit the receiver side information to enhance the code rate , while the codes of  @xcite transform side information into improvements in error performance .",
    "the capacity of general index coding over gaussian broadcast channel is unknown , but information theoretic results are available for some special cases  @xcite .",
    "separation - based coding schemes using a ( noiseless ) index code and a broadcast channel code are , in general , sub - optimal , since the channel decoders do not utilize the receiver side information , and the channel coding rate is limited by the receiver with the worst signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this motivates schemes that perform index coding at the physical layer .",
    "lattice based codes were proposed in  @xcite for the special case of index coding over the gaussian broadcast channel where the transmitter has @xmath4 independent messages , each receiver knows some subset of the @xmath4 messages a priori , and every receiver demands all the messages at the source .",
    "these index codes are designed to convert receiver side information into apparent @xmath5 gains .",
    "the minimum distance of the effective code perceived by a receiver is a function of the index subset of the messages available at the receiver as side information .",
    "the _ side information gain _ of a code is a metric that measures the efficiency with which receiver side information is converted to actual coding gain  @xcite .",
    "the index codes of  @xcite provide large side information gains , and they can be concatenated with outer channel codes to improve coding gain against channel noise .",
    "these index codes , however , suffer from two practical drawbacks : _",
    "_  they do not encode all messages at equal rate , and _",
    "( ii ) _  they do not admit message sizes that are powers of @xmath6 .    in this letter ,",
    "we present the first class of index codes for this special case of gaussian broadcast channel that encode all the messages with equal rate ( section  [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "these new index codes allow messages of arbitrary sizes , including sizes that are powers of @xmath6 .",
    "the proposed index codes are multidimensional qam constellations whose points are labelled with message symbols using the framework of linear codes over the ring @xmath7 of integers modulo @xmath8 . using a computer search , we obtain qam index codes with large side information gains for message sizes @xmath1 , , and number of messages .",
    "we also present simulation results on the performance of a qam index code when used as a modulation scheme in a system employing an outer channel code ( section  [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "we observe that the new @xmath2-qam index modulation scheme for messages , when encoded with an off - the - shelf rate-@xmath9 ldpc code , performs @xmath3  db away from capacity in the gaussian broadcast channel at @xmath10 bit error rate .",
    "we consider a non - fading gaussian broadcast channel with single - antenna terminals , where every receiver demands @xmath4 independent messages from the transmitter , denoted by @xmath11 that assume values from @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the transmitter operates under an average power constraint , the receivers experience additive white gaussian noise ( with possibly different noise powers ) , and each receiver has prior knowledge of some subset of the @xmath4 messages as side information . an @xmath13dimensional _ index code _ @xmath14 for this gaussian broadcast channel consists of a channel code and an encoding function .",
    "the rate of transmission of the @xmath15 message is @xmath16 bits per dimension ( b / dim ) .",
    "a receiver that has the prior knowledge of the symbols , , and experiences a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "we are interested in codes that provide good error performance ( versus @xmath5 ) for every , or equivalently , for receivers , one corresponding to each @xmath18 .",

    "the minimum euclidean distance between any pair of points in @xmath21 determines the error performance at this receiver .",
    "a receiver with has prior knowledge of the value of the message vector @xmath22 .",
    "given the information , , written concisely as , this receiver generates a subcode by expurgating all codewords in @xmath21 with , and decodes @xmath20 to the closest point in @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the minimum euclidean distance of @xmath23 , and @xmath25 . the average error performance and coding gain at this receiver",
    "are determined by @xmath26 . the asymptotic additional @xmath5 gain due to the knowledge of @xmath22 is thus .",
    "this squared distance gain must be measured against the amount of side information in @xmath22 , or equivalently , against the _ side information rate _ . the _ side information gain _",
