    "when matter is subjected to sufficiently extreme temperature or density , both quantum and relativistic effects become important .",
    "such conditions arise in astrophysics and in cosmology and it may be possible to create them experimentally using heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a system at such an extreme temperature or density is most appropriately described by quantum field theory .",
    "the thermodynamic functions that describe the bulk equilibrium properties of such a system are given by the free energy density and its derivatives . if the temperature @xmath0 is high enough that all masses can be neglected , the free energy density depends only on @xmath0 and on the coupling constants of the field theory .",
    "in recent years , there have been significant advances in the perturbative calculation of the free energy for high temperature field theories .",
    "the free energy for a massless scalar field with a @xmath7 interaction was computed to order @xmath11 by frenkel , saa , and taylor  @xcite in 1992 , and the order-@xmath12 correction was recently calculated by parwani and singh @xcite .",
    "the free energy for high temperature qed was calculated to order @xmath13 by coriano and parwani  @xcite , and extended to order @xmath14 by parwani  @xcite .",
    "the free energy for a quark - gluon plasma in the high temperature limit was recently calculated to order @xmath11 by arnold and zhai  @xcite .",
    "the importance of these calculations goes far beyond simply determining one more term in the perturbation series .",
    "the leading term in the perturbation series is just the free energy of an ideal gas .",
    "the order-@xmath15 correction takes into account interactions between particles in the ideal gas . at order @xmath5",
    ", there is a qualitatively new contribution to the free energy .",
    "if the temperature is large compared to the masses of the particles , the force mediated by the exchange of a particle is long - range compared to the typical separation of the particles , which is of order @xmath16 .",
    "the system therefore behaves like a plasma , screening the long - range interaction beyond the scale @xmath17 .",
    "it is this screening that is responsible for the @xmath5 term in the free energy density . because of renormalization effects , the corrections of order @xmath11 and @xmath12 are also important .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath18 depends on an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting ambiguity in the leading nontrivial term in a perturbative expansion can only be reduced by a next - to - leading order calculation . while it may be clear on physical grounds that the scale @xmath19 should be of order @xmath0 , the difference between the choices @xmath4 and @xmath20 can be of great practical significance .",
    "thus a calculation to order @xmath11 is needed in order to determine the appropriate scale @xmath19 in the order-@xmath15 correction to the ideal gas term , while a calculation to order @xmath12 is required in order to determine the scale in the order-@xmath5 plasma term .    in the case of qcd",
    ", there is also a qualitatively new effect that arises at order @xmath21 . as pointed out by linde  @xcite in 1979 , the loop expansion for the free energy breaks down at this order in @xmath1 .",
    "up to order @xmath12 , the free energy can be calculated using a resummation of perturbation theory that takes into account the screening of the chromoelectric force at distances of order @xmath17 .",
    "however the chromomagnetic force is not screened at the scale @xmath3 , and this causes a breakdown in the resummed perturbation expansion at order @xmath21 .",
    "this breakdown has been widely interpreted as implying that nonperturbative effects enter in at this order , rendering the perturbation series meaningless beyond order @xmath12 .",
    "this longstanding problem was recently solved by constructing a sequence of two effective field theories that are equivalent to thermal qcd over successively longer length scales  @xcite .",
    "the first effective theory reproduces the static gauge - invariant correlators of thermal qcd at distances of order @xmath17 or larger , while the second effective theory reproduces the correlators at distances of order @xmath22 or larger . using this construction",
    ", the free energy can be separated into contributions from the momentum scales @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath23 , with well - defined weak coupling expansions that begin at order @xmath24 , @xmath5 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the contributions from the scales @xmath0 and @xmath3 can be computed using perturbative methods . for the contribution from the scale @xmath23",
    ", the coefficients in the weak - coupling expansion can be calculated using lattice simulations of pure - gauge qcd in 3 euclidean dimensions .",
    "this result demonstrates the power of the effective - field - theory approach .",
    "this power can also be brought to bear on other fundamental problems in thermal field theory .",
    "for example , it has also been used to determine the correct asymptotic behavior of the correlator of polyakov loop operators in high temperature qcd  @xcite .",
    "effective field theory provides an effective method for unravelling the effects of the various momentum scales that arise in field theory at high temperature .",
    "in addition to providing insight into the qualitative behavior of the theory , effective field theory can also be used to streamline perturbative calculations , such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use effective field theory to develop a practical method for calculating the thermodynamic functions of a field theory at high temperature @xmath0 and weak coupling @xmath1 . to illustrate the method",
    ", we apply it to a massless scalar field theory with a @xmath7 interaction . in section",
    "ii , we explain how the effective field theory that describes distance scales of order @xmath17 or larger is related to dimensional reduction to the bosonic zero - frequency modes . in section iii",
    ", we show how the parameters of the effective theory can be obtained by matching perturbative calculations in the effective theory and in the full theory . in section iv , we use the effective theory for the massless @xmath7 theory to calculate the free energy to order @xmath12 and the screening mass to order @xmath11 .",
    "the accuracy of these calculations is improved in section v to order @xmath8 for the free energy and to order @xmath9 for the screening mass by using renormalization group equations for the parameters of the effective theory .",
    "we conclude in section vi with a discussion of the application of our effective - field - theory approach to gauge theories and with a brief comparison with related work . in appendices",
    "a and b , we collect all the necessary formulas for sum - integrals in the full theory and for integrals in the 3-dimensional effective theory . in appendix c , we derive the renormalization group equations for the parameters of the effective theory .",
    "in the limit of high temperature @xmath0 , the static correlation functions of a field theory in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions can be reproduced at long distances @xmath25 by an effective field theory in 3 dimensions .",
    "this idea , which is called `` dimensional reduction '' , has a long history @xcite .",
    "it has provided insight into the qualitative behavior of the field theory at high temperature , but it has never been fully exploited for quantitative calculations .",
    "dimensional reduction is based on the fact that static correlation functions for a field theory in thermal equilibrium can be expressed in terms of euclidean functional integrals . the partition function @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hamiltonian operator and @xmath29 .",
    "the operator @xmath30 is the evolution operator that evolves a state from time @xmath31 to the imaginary time @xmath32 .",
    "it can be represented as a functional integral over fields @xmath33 defined on the time interval from 0 to @xmath34 .",
    "it is natural to change variables from @xmath35 to the imaginary time @xmath36 . the partition function ( [ zdef ] ) is then given by the euclidean functional integral @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the negative of the lagrangian density for the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional theory with the time @xmath35 analytically continued to @xmath39 .",
    "the trace in ( [ zdef ] ) is implemented by imposing boundary conditions on the fields : @xmath40 where the plus sign holds for bosonic fields and the minus sign for fermionic fields .",
    "the correlator of two operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 is obtained by averaging their product over fields @xmath43 with the exponential weighting factor in ( [ z ] ) .",
    "because of the periodicity conditions ( [ bc ] ) on the fields , they can be decomposed into fourier modes in @xmath44 , with matsubara frequencies @xmath45 for bosons and @xmath46 for fermions . the contribution to",
    "a correlator from the exchange of a fourier mode with frequency @xmath47 falls off at large @xmath48 like @xmath49 .",
    "thus the only modes whose contributions do not fall off exponentially at distances greater than @xmath16 are the @xmath50 modes of the bosons .",
    "this suggests the strategy of integrating out the fermionic modes and the nonzero modes of the bosons to get an effective theory for the bosonic zero modes .",
    "this process is called `` dimensional reduction '' .",
    "it results in a 3-dimensional euclidean field theory with bosonic fields only which reproduces the static correlators of the original theory at distances @xmath25 .",
    "constructing the dimensionally - reduced effective theory by actually integrating out degrees of freedom is cumbersome beyond leading order in the coupling constant .",
    "once the appropriate 3-dimensional fields and their symmetries have been identified , a better strategy is to use the methods of `` effective field theory '' @xcite .",
    "one writes down the most general lagrangian @xmath51 for the 3-dimensional fields that respects the symmetries .",
    "this effective lagrangian has infinitely many parameters , but they are not arbitrary . by computing static correlators in the full theory , computing the corresponding correlators in the effective theory , and demanding that they agree at distances @xmath25 , one can determine the parameters of @xmath51 in terms of @xmath0 and the parameters of the original theory .",
    "note that this matching procedure does not necessarily require the explicit determination of the relation between the fields in the effective theory and the fundamental fields .    the construction of the 3-dimensional effective theory is complicated by ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences associated with the original 4-dimensional theory are removed by the standard renormalization procedure .",
    "however the 3-dimensional effective theory also has ultraviolet divergences whose origin can be traced to integrating out the nonzero - frequency modes in the full theory .",
    "they must be regularized by introducing an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath52 .",
    "the parameters in @xmath51 must therefore depend on @xmath52 in such a way as to cancel the @xmath52-dependence of the regularized loop integrals in the effective theory .",
    "the natural scale for the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath52 is of order @xmath0 , since this is the scale at which the corresponding integrals are cut off by the nonzero modes in the full theory .",
    "it is useful , however , to keep the cutoff @xmath52 independent of @xmath0 , so that the only dependence on @xmath0 in the effective theory comes from the parameters in @xmath51 . from the point of view of the full theory , the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath52 of the effective theory plays the role of an arbitrary factorization scale that is introduced to separate the momentum scale @xmath0 from lower momentum scales , such as @xmath3 , which can be described within the effective theory .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences of the effective theory include power ultraviolet divergences of the form @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and logarithmic ultraviolet divergences of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a mass scale in the effective theory .",
    "the power divergences and the logarithmic divergences are quite different in character .",
    "the coefficients of the power divergences depend on the regularization procedure and are therefore simply regularization artifacts . in particular , the coefficient of @xmath53 in some observable calculated in the effective theory is independent of the coefficient of @xmath57 for that observable in the full theory",
    ". therefore power divergences of the form @xmath53 from loop integrals must be completely cancelled by terms proportional to @xmath53 in the parameters of @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast to the power divergences , logarithmic ultraviolet divergences have coefficients that are independent of the regularization procedure .",
    "the reason for this is that a logarithmic ultraviolet divergence of the form @xmath55 from a loop integral must match onto a @xmath58 term in one of the parameters of @xmath51 in order for the @xmath52-dependence to cancel .",
    "thus the logarithmic divergences in the effective theory are related to logarithms of @xmath0 in the full theory and therefore have real physical significance . because of the unphysical character of power ultraviolet divergences , it is convenient to use a regularization procedure for the effective theory in which power ultraviolet divergences are subtracted and the remaining logarithmically divergent integrals are cut off at the scale @xmath52 . with such a regularization procedure , only the logarithmic divergences need to be cancelled by the parameters of the effective theory . the subtraction of power divergences can be implemented with any cutoff procedure , including a momentum cutoff or lattice regularization . for perturbative calculations , a particularly convenient cutoff procedure is dimensional regularization , in which momentum integrals are analytically continued to @xmath59 spacial dimensions .",
    "power divergences are automatically subtracted with this method , because integrals without any momentum scale are 0 by definition in dimensional regularization .",
    "the remaining logarithmic ultraviolet divergences appear as poles in @xmath60 , and the renormalization procedure can be completed by subtracting these poles . if @xmath52 is the momentum scale introduced by dimensional regularization , then this `` minimal subtraction '' procedure is equivalent to cutting off the logarithmic ultraviolet divergences at a momentum scale of order @xmath52 .",
    "we turn now to the specific case of a massless scalar field with a @xmath7 interaction . in the partition function ( [ z ] ) , the euclidean lagrangian density is @xmath61 the 3-dimensional effective field theory obtained by dimensional reduction describes a scalar field @xmath62 that can be approximately identified with the zero - frequency mode of the field in the original theory : @xmath63 the symmetries of the effective theory are rotational symmetry and the discrete symmetry @xmath64 , which follows from the symmetry @xmath65 of the fundamental lagrangian ( [ l ] ) . the effective lagrangian has the general form @xmath66 where @xmath67 includes all other local terms that are consistent with the symmetries . the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 and the infinitely many parameters in ( [ leff ] ) depend on the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath52 , the temperature @xmath0 , and the coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "the partition function ( [ z ] ) can be expressed as a euclidean functional integral over the 3-dimensional field @xmath62 : @xmath70 the parameter @xmath71 in the exponential prefactor is the coefficient of the unit operator in the effective lagrangian , which was omitted from @xmath51 in ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "in addition to depending on @xmath15 and @xmath0 , it also depends on @xmath52 in such a way as to cancel the @xmath52-dependence of the functional integral in ( [ zeff ] ) .",
    "the correlator of operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the full theory can be calculated at long distances @xmath25 by identifying the corresponding operators in the effective theory and averaging their product over fields @xmath62 with the exponential weighting factor in ( [ zeff ] ) .",
    "renormalization theory implies that correlators at long distances @xmath25 can be reproduced to any desired accuracy by adding sufficiently many operators to the effective lagrangian and tuning their coefficients with sufficient accuracy as functions of @xmath15 , @xmath0 , and @xmath52 @xcite . with the three terms in the lagrangian that are given explicitly in ( [ leff ] ) , long - distance correlators can only be reproduced with limited accuracy .",
    "if we include the operator @xmath72 , the field theory becomes renormalizable , but this renormalizable theory is still only accurate up to a finite order in the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "this has been interpreted as a breakdown of dimensional reduction @xcite , but the correct interpretation is simply that nonrenormalizable operators must also be included in @xmath51 in order to extend the accuracy to higher order in @xmath1 . in general , one must include all operators that are invariant under rotations and under the symmetry @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting field theory is nonrenormalizable and has infinitely many parameters .",
    "these parameters , however , are not arbitrary , but are determined as functions of @xmath15 , @xmath0 , and @xmath52 by the condition that the effective theory reproduce the long distance behavior of the original theory .",
    "it is easy to determine the magnitude of the coefficient of a general operator in the effective lagrangian . from the kinetic term @xmath74 in ( [ leff ] ) , we see that the field @xmath75 should be assigned a scaling dimension of @xmath76 . the operators given explicitly in ( [ leff ] ) then have dimensions 3 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "if we use a renormalization procedure in which power ultraviolet divergences are subtracted , then by dimensional analysis , an operator of dimension @xmath77 in the effective lagrangian must have a coefficient that is proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "it remains only to determine its order in @xmath1 .",
    "the operator @xmath79 is generated at tree level from the @xmath80 term in the original lagrangian , and therefore has a coefficient proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "all other interaction terms in @xmath51 arise from loop diagrams in the effective theory .",
    "operators with @xmath81 powers of @xmath75 are generated by 1-loop diagrams with @xmath82 4-point interactions and therefore have coefficients of order @xmath83 .",
    "thus an operator with the schematic structure @xmath84 has dimension @xmath85 and will appear in @xmath51 with a coefficient of magnitude @xmath86 .",
    "the case @xmath87 is an exception , because the 1-loop diagram with two external lines is momentum - independent and therefore only the operator @xmath88 is generated at order @xmath15 .",
    "operators of dimension @xmath89 with the schematic structure @xmath90 have coefficients with magnitude @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "the only other exception is @xmath79 , which is generated at tree level and has a coefficient of magnitude @xmath23 .",
    "the coefficients of the operators in the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) must be tuned as functions of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath52 so that the effective theory reproduces the static correlation functions of the full theory at distances @xmath25 .",
    "the parameters can be determined by computing various static quantities in the full theory , computing the corresponding quantities in the effective theory , and demanding that they match . if the running coupling constant @xmath2 of the full theory is small at the scale @xmath0 , then it is convenient to carry out these calculation using perturbation theory in @xmath2 .",
    "a strict perturbation expansion in @xmath15 is afflicted with infrared divergences due to long - range forces mediated by massless particles .",
    "these divergences are screened at the scale @xmath3 , but this screening can only be taken into account by summing up infinite sets of higher - order diagrams .",
    "this breakdown of perturbation theory does not prevent its use as a device for determining the short - distance coefficients in the effective lagrangian .",
    "as long as we can carry out perturbative calculations in the effective theory that make the same incorrect assumptions about the long - distance behavior as perturbation theory in the full theory , we can match the results and determine the short - distance coefficients",
    ".    in the case of the @xmath7 theory , conventional perturbation theory in @xmath15 corresponds to decomposing the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 we will refer to the resulting perturbation theory as a `` strict '' perturbation expansion in @xmath15 .",
    "the free part of the lagrangian describes a massless scalar field .",
    "a mass will not be generated at any finite order in @xmath15 , and the absence of a mass will give rise to infrared divergences that become more and more severe as you go to higher and higher orders in @xmath15 .",
    "this behavior is physically incorrect",
    ". it will be clear from the effective theory that a mass @xmath56 of order @xmath3 is generated by higher loop diagrams and it provides the screening that cuts off the infrared divergences .",
    "one way of dealing with the infrared divergences in the full theory is to use a reorganization of perturbation theory that incorporates the effects of the mass @xmath56 in the free part of the lagrangian .",
    "the simplest possibility @xcite is to write the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) as @xmath93 , where @xmath95 both @xmath15 and @xmath96 in the interaction term are treated as perturbation parameters of the same order .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath96 must be of order @xmath97 in order to avoid large perturbative corrections that grow quadratically with @xmath0 in the high temperature limit .",
    "another possibility is to add the mass term to @xmath98 and subtract it from @xmath99 only for the zero - frequency mode of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "both of these approaches have the drawback that the resulting sums and integrals involve two momentum scales @xmath0 and @xmath56 , making calculations unnecessarily difficult .    a simpler approach is to calculate in both the full theory and the effective theory using ordinary perturbation theory in @xmath15 , but with an infrared cutoff to regularize the infrared divergences . in the full theory , this strict perturbation expansion in @xmath15",
    "is defined by the decomposition ( [ lpert ] ) . in the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) , the coefficients @xmath96 and @xmath100 are of order @xmath15 and all the coefficients in @xmath67 are of order @xmath11 or higher .",
    "thus , in the effective theory , the strict expansion in @xmath15 is defined by the decomposition @xmath101 , where @xmath102 the expansions in @xmath15 defined by ( [ lpert ] ) and ( [ leffpert1 ] ) both generate infrared divergences that become more and more severe in higher orders .",
    "but if the parameters in the effective lagrangian are tuned so that the two theories are equivalent at long distances , then the infrared divergences in their strict perturbative expansions will also match . thus , in spite of the fact that the strict expansion in @xmath15 gives a physically incorrect treatment of infrared effects , we can use it as a device for computing short - distance coefficients .      in this subsection , we calculate the parameter @xmath103 in ( [ zeff ] ) to next - to - next - to - leading order in @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath103 can be interpreted as the coefficient of the unit operator which has been omitted from the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "we will determine @xmath103 by matching calculations of @xmath104 in the full theory and in the effective theory .",
    "we first calculate @xmath105 to next - to - next - to - leading order in @xmath15 using the perturbation expansion for the full theory defined by the decomposition ( [ lpert ] ) .",
    "it is given by the sum of the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "1 : @xmath106 where the sum - integral notation is defined in appendix  a. we regularize both ultraviolet and infrared divergences using dimensional regularization in @xmath107 spatial dimensions , taking the momentum scale introduced by dimensional regularization to be @xmath52 . in ( [ logzint ] ) and below , we use the symbol `` @xmath108 '' for an equality that holds only in a strict perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath15 .",
    "such an equality does not properly take into account the screening of infrared divergences at the scale @xmath3 , but it can be used for determining short - distance coefficients .",
    "the sum - integrals appearing in ( [ logzint ] ) are given in appendix  a. to the order that is required , renormalization of the coupling constant in the @xmath109 scheme is accomplished by the substitution @xmath110 after this renormalization , the final result is @xmath111 \\left ( { g^2 \\over 16 \\pi^2 } \\right)^2 \\bigg\\ } , \\label{logz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is euler s constant and @xmath113 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the apparent dependence of the right side of ( [ logz ] ) on @xmath52 is illusory .",
    "the renormalization group equation for the coupling constant , @xmath114 implies that the explicit logarithmic dependence on @xmath52 in the @xmath11 term of ( [ logz ] ) is cancelled by the @xmath52-dependence of the coupling constant in the @xmath15 term .",
    "thus , up to corrections of order @xmath21 , we can replace @xmath52 on the right side of ( [ logz ] ) by an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath19 .",
    "we now consider @xmath105 in the effective theory : @xmath115 the partition function @xmath116 for the effective theory is the functional integral in ( [ zeff ] ) .",
    "in the diagrammatic expansion for @xmath117 , the leading terms are given by the diagrams in fig .  1 , plus additional diagrams involving mass insertions as in fig .  2 .",
    "to match with the strict expansion in @xmath15 for the full theory , we should calculate in the effective theory using the perturbation theory defined by the decomposition ( [ leffpert1 ] ) , again using dimensional regularization to regularize both ultraviolet and infrared divergences .",
    "this calculation is trivial , since massless loop diagrams with no external legs vanish in dimensional regularization due to a cancellation between ultraviolet poles in @xmath60 and infrared poles in @xmath60 .",
    "the result is therefore @xmath118 matching the results ( [ logz ] ) and ( [ logzeff2 ] ) , we obtain the coefficient @xmath103 to order @xmath11 : @xmath119 \\left ( { g^2 \\over 16 \\pi^2 } \\right)^2 \\bigg\\ } , \\label{f}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the coupling constant in the @xmath109 renormalization scheme at the scale @xmath19 .",
