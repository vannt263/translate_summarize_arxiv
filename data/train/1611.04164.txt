    "model predictive control ( mpc ) @xcite is a model - based control method which involves the solution at each sampling period of a finite horizon optimal control problem subject to the system dynamics and constraints .",
    "this form of mpc , whose control actions are obtained by an online optimization , is referred to as implicit mpc . to reduce the online computational complexity of such an optimal control problem ,",
    "two directions have been investigated . on the one hand ,",
    "more efficient optimization strategies have been proposed in the aforementioned implicit mpc context .",
    "these approaches try to exploit as far as possible the problem structure and the possibility to use hot starts in order to reduce the number of iterations needed to reach a good solution ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the so - called explicit mpc ( empc ) has been the subject of significant research efforts , where the control laws are available a priori , accordingly reducing an online optimization to a function evaluation .",
    "this contribution lies in this second direction with nonlinear systems as targeted domain of application .    for linear or hybrid systems ,",
    "the explicit control laws can be exactly solved offline via parametric programming @xcite @xcite . as for nonlinear systems , deriving the true optimal nonlinear mpc ( nmpc ) control law is generally not possible and hence approximate approaches have to be followed . following this direction ,",
    "several techniques have been devised where the mpc control laws are approximated using piecewise affine approximators @xcite , artificial neural networks @xcite @xcite and set memberships identification @xcite @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , piecewise affine approaches normally lead to an excessive number of regions needed to represent the approximate control law while standard nonlinear approximators offer universal capabilities at the price of non - convex optimization schemes .",
    "thus , approximating ( or learning ) the mpc control laws by piecewise nonlinear ( pwnl ) functions are recently of interest ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper suggests a practical computational methodology to empcs derived from learning data that incorporates implicit mpc solution and a problem - dependent regressor .",
    "in particular , each component of the control vector is identified independently as a pwnl map of the available regressor .",
    "a heuristic identification procedure to do so is proposed , which is an extension of the preliminary work @xcite . regarding complexity ,",
    "the pwnl representations of the identified empcs allows to reduce the number of regions with respect to the piecewise affine approaches , especially for constrained nmpcs .",
    "compared to the standard nonlinear structures , the methodology takes advantages of efficient computation of constrained linear ( or quadratic ) programming problems .",
    "the preliminary version of this paper has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the current work introduces additional details , including the improvement of algorithms , their numerical analysis as well as one more multivariable control application , namely , the constrained control of the compression station used in the cryogenic refrigerators .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : nl ] recalls the identification of a nonlinear map proposed in @xcite .",
    "the extension of this framework to the piecewise nonlinear maps is explained in section [ sec : pwnl ] where an identification methodology is developed with application to empcs .",
    "two real control design problems are used in section [ sec : apps ] to assess the ability of the proposed methodology to approximate the mpc control laws with rather small number of regions and the possibility to monitor the complexity as a function of the required precision . moreover , the resulting computation time is compared to the one obtained by the state - of - the - art solver acado @xcite , showing the potential benefit from the explicit representation to extend the applicability of the mpc framework .",
