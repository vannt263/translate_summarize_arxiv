    "before proceeding with the relevant background material , we briefly clarify the notations we use throughout the paper .",
    "when we use the notation @xmath5 , we are referring to either the point group @xmath5 , or to the @xmath0-fold rotation , the choice of which should be clear given the context .",
    "@xmath35 refers an operator in the hilbert space corresponding to the @xmath0-fold rotation .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the matrix representation of the operator @xmath35 in a basis , either the orbital basis or the occupied - band basis , which should be discernible given the context of its usage .",
    "similar definitions and distinctions apply to other operators , e.g. , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 refer to mirror symmetry @xmath40 , its operator in hilbert space , and a matrix representation of the operator , respectively .",
    "finally , when used as indices , the greek letters will always span the orbitals , while roman letters denote either the bands or spatial directions ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) . in all equations ,",
    "repeated indices are , unless otherwise noted , automatically summed for the following types of summations : summation over all sites in the system , summation over all sites in the subsystem on which the entanglement spectrum is calculated , summation over all orbitals , summation over all bands ( occupied and unoccupied ) .",
    "a point group is a group of all symmetry operations ( an atom , a molecule or a lattice ) that leave at least one point fixed in space . in nature",
    ", there exist an infinite number of point groups . on the other hand ,",
    "crystallographic point groups are point groups that are consistent with lattice translational symmetry .",
    "the crystallographic restriction theorem states that lattice translational symmetry dictates that @xmath43 for any @xmath0-fold rotation axis and effectively limits the total number of crystallographic point groups . in 2d",
    "there are 10 different point groups allowed which are comprised of five cyclic groups and five dihedral groups . a cyclic point group @xmath5 consists of all powers of an @xmath0-fold rotation while a dihedral point group @xmath44 contains @xmath5 as a subgroup and an additional two - fold in - plane rotation axis .",
    "in this paper we will focus on @xmath5 pgs .",
    "with the point groups defined , we now consider the representations of point groups in a single particle hilbert space . in the representation",
    ", every symmetry operation corresponds to an operator in the hilbert space . as we will discuss both _",
    "spinless _ and _ spinful _ fermions , it is necessary at this point to introduce double point groups , @xmath45 .",
    "mathematically speaking , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the identify operator and a rotation of angle @xmath49 about any axis in space , which satisfies @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "this enlarged group has physical meanings as one considers its representations , which are classified into two types : in the first type @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the identity matrix ; in the second type @xmath55 .",
    "representations of the first type are referred to as single - valued and representations of the second type are called double - valued .",
    "a degenerate subspace , in which every state has the same energy , of a single fermion must form a single - valued / double - valued representation of the underlying pgs of the hamiltonian if the particles are spinless / spinful , as we know that a spinful fermion takes an extra minus sign as it is rotated by @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath5 pgs , as one applies the general statement to hilbert space representation of @xmath5 pgs , one can obtain @xmath56 , and if in the orbital / band space representations , similarly , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) for spinless ( spinful ) fermions .    given the hilbert space representation @xmath60 of a point group operator @xmath61 , we now look at the sufficient and necessary conditions for a single particle tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath62 to be invariant under this operator .",
    "we assume that in one unit cell at @xmath63 there are @xmath64 orbitals at @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the offset vector of the atom from the nearest lattice point .",
    "note that we have ignored all unit cell structures , a simplification that spares us from discussing non - symmorphic space groups , which contain operations combined from member of a point group and translations by fractions of lattice vectors .",
    "now the pgs operator @xmath61 sends an electron at @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath61 is a symmetry , there must be another atom at @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 is also a lattice point .",
    "writing the above relation in second quantization , we have [ eq : realspacetransform]c_()^-1=__c_().in this equation , @xmath71 describes a possible rotation of an orbital under @xmath61 .",
    "for example , suppose we are considering @xmath72-orbitals under @xmath73 a four - fold rotation about @xmath74-axis , then obviously , @xmath75 is sent to @xmath76 , @xmath76 to @xmath77 and @xmath78 to @xmath78 .",
    "in this case we have in the basis of @xmath79 _ 4= (    ccc 0 & -1 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 +    ) .if we adopt the following definitions of fourier transform of @xmath80 c_(k)=_c_()(-ik),from eq.([eq : realspacetransform ] ) , we obtain :    [ eq : kspacetransform]c_(k)^-1&=&__c_()(-ik ) + & = & _ _",
    "c_( ) + & = & _ _",
    "c_( ) + & = & _ c_(rk)e^ik(-r ) + & & |_(k)c_(rk ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath81 is a unitary matrix using that @xmath60 is a unitary symmetry operation .",
    "a tight - binding model hamiltonian with translational symmetry @xmath82 transforms under @xmath60 as ^-1=_k(|(k)(k)|^-1(k))_c_(rk)c_(rk).if @xmath61 is a symmetry , we have @xmath83 therefore    @xmath84 , we have ( k)^-1=(rk)[eq : rconstraint].eq.([eq : rconstraint ] ) determines the sufficient and necessary conditions for a single - particle tight - binding hamiltonian to be invariant under a point group symmetry @xmath61 . for a @xmath5 invariant 2d system , the above equation simplifies to [ eq : cnconstraint]&&_n(k_x , k_y)_n^-1= + & & ( k_x()-k_y(),k_x()+k_y()),where @xmath36 is the transformation matrix in the orbital basis for the @xmath0-fold rotation about @xmath74-axis .      in this paper , we define a topological insulator as a system the many - body ground state of which can not be adiabatically deformed into the ground state in the atomic limit@xcite .",
    "the atomic limit is the limit of zero coupling between orbitals on different atoms but with all symmetries of the system preserved .",
    "every system in this limit is considered as a trivial insulator .",
    "clearly then , insulators that can not be continuously tuned to the atomic limit while preserving the gap and all symmetries are nontrivial topological insulators according to this definition .",
    "this definition enables us to use any quantized quantity depending on the wavefunction to differentiate topologically trivial and non - trivial insulators .",
    "this is because a quantized quantity only changes when gap is closed , thus if the value of this quantity in an insulator is different than that in its atomic limit , it must be a topologically non - trivial insulator , or simply , a topological insulator .",
    "such a quantity is called a topological index , the choice of which is determined completely by the dimensionality and the given symmetries of a hamiltonian .",
    "this definition comprises more types of non - trivial topologies than those that may be labeled by a non - zero @xmath13 or @xmath9 index .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that a good quantum number that denotes a topological state is not necessarily a physical observable such as hall conductance .",
    "such a case has been noted previously in non - trivial topological insulators possessing inversion symmetry .",
    "these systems have topologically protected in - gap states at exactly @xmath24 in the entanglement spectrum and thus they can not be removed by adiabatic deformations of the hamiltonian@xcite . nevertheless , while the number of in - gap states is a topological index , it is not related to any yet known experimental observable .",
    "we have defined the general single particle entanglement spectrum in eq.([eq : defentspec ] ) , and here we restrict the definition to the entanglement spectrum associated with a special type of subsystem : _ real space _ cuts . to begin , the correlation matrix for a real space cut is given by [ eq : cdef]c_i , j = c^_((i))c_((j)),where @xmath85 denotes a unit cell within a predefined subset of the system , called @xmath21 , and @xmath86 denote orbitals in a unit cell .",
    "suppose in the selected subset one has @xmath87 unit cells and each unit cell has @xmath88 orbitals , the entanglement is then given by a @xmath89 matrix , where @xmath87 is the number of sites in the real space cut @xmath21 .",
    "the set of eigenvalues of the matrix is defined as the single - particle entanglement spectrum or simply entanglement spectrum associated with subset @xmath21 .",
    "the definition is a special one as it confines the @xmath90-operators within a predefined set of sites in real space . in general , there are other types of cuts such as momentum cuts or orbital cuts@xcite , which confine the @xmath90-operators within a range of momentum or a set of orbitals ( e.g. , landau orbitals ) . from definition , it is easy to show that all eigenvalues of @xmath91 , i.e. , all ` energies ' in the spectrum , are within the range @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "a cut may be chosen as the whole system , @xmath22 , and one can prove that in this case the correlation matrix @xmath93 must be a projector matrix , whose eigenvalue is either zero or unity@xcite .",
    "the reason we are only interested in real space cuts in this paper is that we will focus on band insulators , whose constituent single particle wavefunctions are completely local in momentum space with @xmath14 as a good quantum number .",
    "therefore all eigenvalues in a momentum cut must be either zero or unity , a situation usually referred to as trivial .",
    "on the other hand , a real space cut has a potential to distinguish insulators that can be adiabatically tuned into the atomic limit and those that can not be . to better understand this point ,",
    "let us consider an insulator in the atomic limit .",
    "in this limit all single particle wavefunctions are localized , and therefore when a real space cut is made , a particle must be either totally inside or totally outside the subsystem defined by the cut .",
    "this forces the eigenvalue of the correlation matrix to be either @xmath94 if the particle is located within the cut or @xmath95 if the particle is outside of the cut .",
    "if an insulator _ can not _ be adiabatically tuned to the atomic limit , _ then within the entanglement spectrum there must be eigenvalues that are topologically prevented from approaching arbitrary vicinities of @xmath94 or @xmath95_. we may gain additional insight into the entanglement spectrum by considering a 2d iqh state , or a chern insulator , that has @xmath91 ( @xmath96chern number ) protected extended states and , when a real space cut is made , there must be at least the same number of states that are neither inside nor outside the subsystem defined by the cut .",
    "these extended topological states present themselves as protected ` in - gap ' , neither 0 nor 1 , states in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "this means that existence of protected in - gap states in the entanglement spectrum implies existence of intrinsically delocalized states .",
    "the single particle entanglement spectrum is closely related to the entanglement entropy@xcite by [ eq : entropy ] e_q=-_n[_n_n+(1-_n)(1-_n)],where @xmath97 is the @xmath0th eigenvalue in the spectrum .",
    "entanglement entropy is known to quantify non - trivial topology in insulators : if the entanglement entropy can not be adiabatically tuned to zero , the insulator is topologically non - trivial . when there are protected in - gap states in the entanglement spectrum , then from eq.([eq : entropy ] ) the entanglement entropy always remain finite .",
    "therefore , presence of protected in - gap states indicates non - trivial topology in an insulator .",
    "let us begin our study of the entanglement spectrum of point group symmetric topological insulators by examining the inversion invariant system@xcite in 1d .",
    "the system is assumed to have @xmath98 sites where @xmath98 is an _ even _ number .",
    "the inversion center is _ at the midway _ of the @xmath99-th site and @xmath100-th site . for",
    "now , we assume that the system is translationally invariant , hence from eq.([eq : rconstraint ] ) we have @xmath101=[\\mathcal{p},\\mathcal{h}(\\pi)]=0 $ ] , by which we can label all eigenstates at @xmath95 and @xmath102 with their eigenvalues under @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are called the invariant @xmath105-points under inversion , denoted by @xmath106 . for a reason",
    "that is detailed in appendix [ apndx : different_sewing ] , we now use , instead of eigenvalues of @xmath103 , eigenvalues of @xmath107 to label the eigenstates at @xmath108 . for inversion invariant system ,",
    "the symmetry fixed point is in the middle of two sites so @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "from this we have @xmath111 .",
    "now we separate the left - half of the system , from the @xmath94st to the @xmath99th site , as the subsystem @xmath21 and calculate the entanglement spectrum @xmath112 .",
    "there can be eigenvalues in the spectrum lying exactly at @xmath113 , and the number of these eigenvalues is given by n_1/2=|_k_inv(n^+(k_inv)-n^-(k_inv))|[eq:1d_in - gap],where @xmath114 and @xmath115 represent the number of _ occupied _ states with @xmath116 and @xmath117 eigenvalue of @xmath118 of the @xmath4th band , respectively .",
    "if there is an impurity potential , it will generally split the @xmath24-in - gap degeneracy ; however , if the impurity potential is also inversion symmetric , having equal magnitude at the @xmath119-th site and the @xmath120-th site , the mid - gap states are preserved .",
    "in fact , we desire to make the statement more general by showing that the same result holds for all ` inversion symmetric cuts ' , of which the above left - half cut is a special case .",
    "the subset which defines an inversion symmetric cut does not have to be the left or the right half , but should satisfy the following conditions : first , the subset @xmath21 has exactly @xmath99 sites , and second , if site @xmath119 is in @xmath21 , site @xmath121 must not be in @xmath21 .",
    "such a subset @xmath21 will be referred to as an inversion symmetric cut .",
    "a set containing all sites left to the inversion center is a symmetric cut , and several other possible symmetric cuts are plotted in fig.[fig : onedcut ] .",
    "below , we will use @xmath122 to denote the position of the @xmath119-th site in the cut for @xmath123 .",
    "when the sum is over @xmath119 , it means summing over @xmath122 ; when the sum is over @xmath124 , it means summing over all sites in @xmath22 .",
    "while the correlation matrix @xmath91 in eq.([eq : cdef ] ) is not a projector , if @xmath21 is an inversion symmetric cut in an inversion invariant insulator , @xmath91 can be expressed as the linear average of two projectors @xmath125 and @xmath126 . to show this , we define new operators:[eq : defofd]d_i&=&(c_(r_i)+c_(r_i))/ , +    @xmath127 is the orbital index ( including spin ) .",
    "these are the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the annihilation operators .",
    "the single particle entanglement matrix for subsystem @xmath21 is : c_i , j&=&c^_(r_i)c_(r_i ) + & = & ( d^_i+|d^_i)(d_j+|d_j).then we point out a simple fact:[eq : orthogonality]d^_i|d_j=|d^_id_j=0.to prove this one only needs to notice that the ground state wavefunction must be an eigenstate of @xmath128 , and that @xmath129 while @xmath130 . using eq.([eq : orthogonality ] ) , we havec_i , j=(d_i , j+|d_i , j),whered_i , j&=&d^_id_j , +     next we prove that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are projector matrices , i.e. , @xmath131 and @xmath132 . in an inversion invariant system , all single particle eigenstates can be divided into two subspaces with even and odd parity respectively .",
    "we use @xmath133 to denote the annihilation operator of an even parity eigenstate and @xmath134 to denote that of an odd parity eigenstate , i.e. , @xmath135 and @xmath136 . here",
    "@xmath0 is not a band label as before , because we do not have translational symmetry , but simply an index counting all single particle states . in a system with @xmath98 sites and @xmath88 orbitals per site",
    ", there are @xmath137 states with even and odd parity respectively , so @xmath0 ranges from 1 to @xmath137 in general .",
    "every creation / annihilation operator can be expressed in this basis and we have the unitary transformc_r = u_r , n_n+v_r , n|_n.then from eq.([eq : defofd ] ) we have @xmath138 . on the other hand we have _",
    "n&=&u^_n , rc_r , + _",
    "n&=&_n + & = & u^_n , rc_r + & = & u^_n , r_c_n+1-r.equating right hand sides of the last two equations , we have[eq : eq21]u_r , n=_u_n+1-r , n .    using these relations",
    "we can prove that @xmath125 is a projector by calculating @xmath139 directly . in fact,[eq",

    ".    care should be taken to note that @xmath140 ! this is because by summing @xmath141 we only sum half of the system . when inserting eq.([eq : eq21 ] ) we obtain : u^_m , r_ju_r_j , n&=&u^_m , n+1-r_j^__u_n+1-r_j , n + & = & u^_m , n+1-r_ju_n+1-r_j , nthis leads to [ eq : eq25]u^_m , r_ju_r_j , n = u^_m , ru_r , n=.substituting eq.([eq : eq25 ] ) into eq.([eq : eq23 ] ) , we see @xmath131 , or @xmath125 is a projector .    using eqs.([eq : eq22],[eq : eq25 ] ) , it is easy to see that every row in @xmath142 is an eigenvector of @xmath125 . if @xmath133 annihilates an occupied state , this vector has eigenvalue @xmath94 and if @xmath133 annihilates an unoccupied state , it has eigenvalue @xmath95 .",
    "so the dimension of @xmath125 , or the number of unity eigenvalues is : @xmath143 , or the number of occupied eigenstates with even parity .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that @xmath144 , or the number of occupied eigenstates with odd parity .",
    "if @xmath145 , there must be at least @xmath146 common eigenstates of @xmath125 and @xmath126 with unity and zero eigenvalues , respectively . these states are therefore eigenstates of @xmath91 with eigenvalue exactly at @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath24-in - gap states . and",
    "if @xmath147 , there must be @xmath148 @xmath24-in - gap states .",
    "in general , we have @xmath149 the two integers @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the numbers of occupied eigenstates with even and an equal number of states with odd parities , or in other words , they are eigenstates in the two 1d representations of the inversion point group . these two numbers , @xmath152 , give a @xmath29 classification of inversion invariant insulators .",
    "the sum of its two components @xmath153 is simply the total number of fermions , and their difference @xmath154 is exactly the number of protected in - gap states in the entanglement spectrum , i.e. , [ eq : z1z2]n_1/2=|z_1-z_2|.in a trivial insulator , one has @xmath155 , while any pair @xmath30 with @xmath156 denotes a topologically non - trivial inversion invariant insulator .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the proof presented here , up to this point , does not require translational symmetry .",
    "now we may proceed to calculate @xmath157 and @xmath158 by relating them to the inversion eigenvalues at high symmetry @xmath105-points @xmath95 and @xmath102 in presence of translational symmetry .",

    "due to inversion symmetry , the single particle states @xmath162 and @xmath163 , in which @xmath164 refers to the vacuum state and not the fermi sea , are the eigenstates of @xmath62 .",

    ", we must emphasize the following two points that give us insights for extending our work on inversion invariant insulators to @xmath5 invariant insulators .",
    "first , we want to choose a subsystem that is conjugal to its complementary subsystem with respect to the point group symmetry , because in this case , the correlation matrix decomposes into a linear average of projectors .",
    "second , we can define an integer for each 1d representation of the point group , which is the total number of occupied states that transform according to that representation .",

    "write the correlation matrix @xmath91 as the linear average of two projector matrices @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
