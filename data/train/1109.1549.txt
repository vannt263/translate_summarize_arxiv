    "we will set the spin to be equal to 1 or @xmath0 .",

    "let @xmath3 be a configuration of spins @xmath4 or @xmath0 .",
    "the energy of the configuration @xmath5 is given by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 means that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are neighbors in @xmath10 .",
    "the energy is , up to an additive constant , twice the number of disagreeing neighbors . following a fundamental principle of physics",
    ", the spin - configuration is sampled proportionally to its boltzmann weight : at an inverse - temperature @xmath11 , the probability @xmath12 of a configuration @xmath5 satisfies @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the so - called _ partition function _ defined in such a way that the sum of the weights over all possible configurations equals 1 . above a certain _ critical inverse - temperature _ @xmath15",
    ", the model has a _ spontaneous magnetization _ while below @xmath15 does not ( this phenomenon will be described in more detail in the next section ) .",
    "when @xmath15 lies strictly between 0 and @xmath16 , the ising model is said to undergo a phase transition between an _ ordered _ and a _ disordered _ phase .",
    "the fundamental question is to study the phase transition between the two regimes .",
    "ising configurations at @xmath17 , at @xmath18 , and @xmath19 respectively.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    lenz s student ising proved the absence of phase transition in dimension one ( meaning @xmath20 ) in his phd thesis @xcite , wrongly conjecturing the same picture in higher dimensions .",
    "this belief was widely shared , and motivated heisenberg to introduce his famous model @xcite . however , some years later peierls @xcite used estimates on the length of interfaces between spin clusters to disprove the conjecture , showing a phase transition in the two - dimensional case .",
    "later , kramers and wannier @xcite derived nonrigorously the value of the critical temperature .    in 1944 ,",
    "onsager @xcite computed the partition function of the model , followed by further computations with kaufman , see @xcite for instance . in the physical approach to statistical models ,",
    "the computation of the partition function is the first step towards a deep understanding of the model , enabling for instance the computation of the free energy .",
    "the formula provided by onsager led to an explosion in the number of results on the 2d ising model ( papers published on the ising model can now be counted in the thousands ) . among the most noteworthy results ,",
    "yang derived rigorously the spontaneous magnetization @xcite ( the result was derived nonrigorously by onsager himself ) .",
    "mccoy and wu @xcite computed many important quantities of the ising model , including several critical exponents , culminating with the derivation of two - point correlations between sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the whole plane .",
    "see the more recent book of palmer for an exposition of these and other results @xcite .",
    "the computation of the partition function was accomplished later by several other methods and the model became the most prominent example of an exactly solvable model .",
    "the most classical techniques include the transfer - matrices technique developed by lieb and baxter @xcite , the pfaffian method , initiated by fisher and kasteleyn , using a connection with dimer models @xcite , and the combinatorial approach to the ising model , initiated by kac and ward @xcite and then developed by sherman @xcite and vdovichenko @xcite ; see also the more recent @xcite .    despite the number of results that can be obtained using the partition function , the impossibility of computing it explicitly enough in finite volume made the geometric study of the model very hard to perform while using the classical methods .",
    "the lack of understanding of the geometric nature of the model remained mathematically unsatisfying for years .",
    "the arrival of the renormalization group formalism ( see @xcite for a historical exposition ) led to a better physical and geometrical understanding , albeit mostly non - rigorous .",
    "it suggests that the block - spin renormalization transformation ( coarse - graining , _",
    "e.g. _ replacing a block of neighboring sites by one site having a spin equal to the dominant spin in the block ) corresponds to appropriately changing the scale and the temperature of the model .",
    "the kramers - wannier critical point then arises as the fixed point of the renormalization transformations . in particular , under",
    "simple rescaling the ising model at the critical temperature should converge to a scaling limit , a continuous version of the originally discrete ising model , corresponding to a quantum field theory .",
    "this leads to the idea of universality : the ising models on different regular lattices or even more general planar graphs belong to the same renormalization space , with a unique critical point , and so at criticality the scaling limit and the scaling dimensions of the ising model should always be the same ( it should be independent of the lattice whereas the critical temperature depends on it ) .",
    "being unique , the scaling limit at the critical point must satisfy translation , rotation and scale invariance , which allows one to deduce some information about correlations @xcite . in seminal papers",
    "@xcite , belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov suggested a much stronger invariance of the model .",
    "since the scaling - limit quantum field theory is a local field , it should be invariant by any map which is locally a composition of translation , rotation and homothety .",
    "thus it becomes natural to postulate full conformal invariance ( under all conformal transformations of subregions ) .",
    "this prediction generated an explosion of activity in conformal field theory , allowing nonrigorous explanations of many phenomena ; see @xcite for a collection of the original papers of the subject .    to summarize",
    ", conformal field theory asserts that the ising model admits a scaling limit at criticality , and that this scaling limit is a conformally invariant object . from a mathematical perspective , this notion of conformal invariance of a model is ill - posed , since the meaning of scaling limit is not even clear .",
    "the following solution to this problem can be implemented : the scaling limit of the model could simply retain the information given by interfaces only .",
    "there is no reason why all the information of a model should be encoded into information on interfaces , yet one can hope that most of the relevant quantities can be recovered from it .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that there exists a mathematical setting for families of continuous curves .    in the ising model",
    ", there is a canonical way to isolate macroscopic interfaces .",
    "consider a simply - connected domain @xmath23 with two points @xmath24 and @xmath25 on the boundary and approximate it by a discrete graph @xmath26 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath27 determines two arcs @xmath28 and @xmath29 and we can fix the spins to be @xmath30 on the arc @xmath28 and @xmath0 on the arc @xmath29 ( this is called dobrushin boundary conditions ) . in this case , there exists an interface .",
    "] separating @xmath30 and @xmath0 going from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and the prediction of conformal field theory then translates into the following predictions for models : interfaces in @xmath27 converge when @xmath31 goes to 0 to a random continuous non - selfcrossing curve @xmath32 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath23 which is conformally invariant in the following way :     an interface between @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the ising model.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in 1999 , schramm proposed a natural candidate for the possible conformally invariant families of continuous non - selfcrossing curves .",
    "he noticed that interfaces of models further satisfy the _ domain markov property _ , which , together with the assumption of conformal invariance , determine the possible families of curves . in @xcite , he introduced the _ schramm - loewner evolution _",
    "( sle for short ) : for @xmath35 , the sle(@xmath36 ) is the random loewner evolution with driving process @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a standard brownian motion ( see beffara s course in this volume ) . in our case",
    ", it implies that the random continuous curve @xmath32 described previously should be an sle .",
    "proving convergence of interfaces to an sle is fundamental .",
    "indeed , sle processes are now well - understood and their path properties can be related to fractal properties of the critical phase .",
    "critical exponents can then be deduced from these properties via the so - called _ scaling relations_. these notes provide an ( almost ) self - contained proof of convergence to sle for the two - dimensional ising model and its random - cluster representation the fk - ising model ( see section  [ sec : fk - ising ] for a formal definition ) .",
    "* main result 1 * _ ( theorem  [ convergence spin interface ] ) the law of interfaces of the critical ising model converges in the scaling limit to a conformally invariant limit described by the schramm - loewner evolution of parameter @xmath39 .",
    "_    * main result 2 * _ ( theorem  [ convergence fk interface ] ) the law of interfaces of the critical fk - ising model converges in the scaling limit to a conformally invariant limit described by the schramm - loewner evolution of parameter @xmath40 .",
    "_    even though we now have a mathematical framework for conformal invariance , it remains difficult to prove convergence of interfaces to sles .",
    "observe that working with interfaces offers a further simplification : properties of these interfaces should also be conformally invariant .",
    "therefore , one could simply look at a discrete _ observable _ of the model and try to prove that it converges in the scaling limit to a conformally covariant object . of course , it is not clear that this observable would tell us anything about critical exponents , yet it already represents a significant step toward conformal invariance .    in 1994 , langlands , pouliot and saint - aubin @xcite published a number of numerical values in favor of conformal invariance ( in the scaling limit ) of crossing probabilities in the percolation model .",
    "more precisely , they checked that , taking different topological rectangles , the probability @xmath41 of having a path of adjacent open edges from @xmath42 to @xmath43 converges when @xmath31 goes to 0 towards a limit which is the same for @xmath44 and @xmath45 if they are images of each other by a conformal map .",
    "the paper @xcite , while only numerical , attracted many mathematicians to the domain . the same year",
    ", cardy @xcite proposed an explicit formula for the limit of percolation crossing probabilities . in 2001 , smirnov proved cardy s formula rigorously for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice @xcite , hence rigorously providing a concrete example of a conformally invariant property of the model .",
    "a somewhat incredible consequence of this theorem is that the mechanism can be reversed : even though cardy s formula seems much weaker than convergence to sle , they are actually equivalent . in other words ,",
    "conformal covariance of one well - chosen observable of the model can be sufficient to prove conformal invariance of interfaces .",
    "it is also possible to find an observable with this property in the ising case ( see definition  [ definition spin ising ] ) .",
    "this observable , called the _ fermionic observable _ , is defined in terms of the so - called high temperature expansion of the ising model .",
    "specific combinatorial properties of the ising model translate into local relations for the fermionic observable .",
    "in particular , the observable can be proved to converge when taking the scaling limit .",
    "this convergence result ( theorem  [ convergence spin observable ] ) is the main step in the proof of conformal invariance .",
    "similarly , a fermionic observable can be defined in the fk - ising case , and its convergence implies the convergence of interfaces .",
    "archetypical examples of conformally covariant objects are holomorphic solutions to boundary value problems such as dirichlet or riemann problems .",
    "it becomes natural to expect that discrete observables which are conformally covariant in the scaling limit are naturally preharmonic or preholomorphic functions , _",
    "i.e. _ relevant discretizations of harmonic and holomorphic functions .",
    "therefore , the proofs of conformal invariance harness _ discrete complex analysis _ in a substantial way .",
    "the use of discrete holomorphicity appeared first in the case of dimers @xcite and has been extended to several statistical physics models since then .",
    "other than being interesting in themselves , preholomorphic functions have found several applications in geometry , analysis , combinatorics , and probability .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the expositions by lovsz @xcite , stephenson @xcite , mercat @xcite , bobenko and suris @xcite .",
    "let us finish by mentioning that the previous discussion sheds a new light on both approaches described above : combinatorial properties of the discrete ising model allow us to prove the convergence of discrete observables to conformally covariant objects .",
    "in other words , exact integrability and conformal field theory are connected via the proof of the conformal invariance of the ising model .",
