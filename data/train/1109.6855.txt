    "vertical nonlinear charge transport in undoped , weakly coupled , photoexcited superlattices ( sls ) has many similarities to extended excitable or oscillatory media . in both cases ,",
    "traveling waves such as wave fronts , pulses , or wave trains play an important role in the dynamics of the system.@xcite in undoped sls , the formation and dynamics of electric field domains ( efds ) are the basic mechanisms behind more complex phenomena such as self - sustained oscillations of the current ( ssoc ) through voltage - biased sls , chaos , etc .",
    "interfaces separating efds are wave fronts or wave front - bound pulses , and pulses are the building blocks of wave trains",
    ". while there are at least two stable efds with an almost constant value of the electric field in the case of doped sls , there may be only one stable efd in the case of an undoped sl under high photoexcitation.@xcite this is similar to what happens in excitable media such as those described by the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) model for nerve conduction.@xcite for background information on this model and related models , see refs .",
    "the case of an oscillatory medium in which there is a single unstable spatially homogeneous state can also be realized in both the fhn model and a strongly photoexcited undoped sl.@xcite however , the electric field in a voltage - biased sl with a finite number of periods is constrained to have a fixed area underneath its spatial profile , and this constraint causes it to exhibit a more complex behavior.@xcite    the key ingredient to the complex dynamics of electron transport in photoexcited undoped sls is the introduction of an electron - hole recombination coefficient , which is a function of the electric field .",
    "nonlinear charge transport in weakly coupled undoped type - i superlattices ( sl ) under photoexcitation is well described by spatially discrete drift - diffusion systems ( ddds ) of equations.@xcite in earlier models , the electron - hole recombination was considered to be a constant , independent of the electric field.@xcite in this case , there are three stable states with spatially homogeneous field profiles , and the predicted nonlinear phenomena are then quite similar to the ones observed in the much better known case of doped sls ( in which the hole density is replaced by a constant doping density ) : the dynamics is organized by stable wave fronts that join the stable homogeneous states.@xcite introducing a field - dependent electron - hole recombination coefficient in the model has striking consequences.@xcite for high photoexcitation densities , it is possible to find only one stable efd , not two as in the case of a constant recombination coefficient.@xcite then , under a dc voltage bias , periodic or chaotic ssoc may appear .",
    "the field profile during self - oscillations may exhibit nucleation of dipole waves inside the sample , splitting of one wave in two , and motion of the resulting waves in opposite directions . despite the strong asymmetry induced by the drift terms in the equations ,",
    "these dipole waves resemble the pulses in the fhn model for nerve conduction@xcite and are quite different from field profiles for a field - independent recombination coefficient.@xcite    in this paper , we construct relevant stable solutions of the ddds of equations for dc - current - biased sl by means of asymptotic and numerical methods that extend and refine those used for the discrete fhn system.@xcite for an undoped sl that acts as an excitable medium ( only one stable efd ) , we find that electric field pulses moving downstream with the electron flux can be described using matched asymptotic expansions based on separating the sharp leading and trailing wave fronts of the pulse from smoother regions outside them .",
    "pulses moving upstream do so much more slowly and experience a saltatory motion , in which intervals of a slow change are separated by fast changes during which the pulse jumps to the previous sl period . for an undoped sl acting as an oscillatory medium ( a single unstable efd ) , we construct periodic wave trains consisting of an infinite succession of pulses .",
