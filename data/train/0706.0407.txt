    "in studying galactic dynamics , kinematic measurements over two spatial dimensions provide the necessary wealth of information .",
    "currently used methods for achieving such observations , have either limited angular resolution ( radio or submillimeter astronomy ) or cover a relatively small field of view ( integral field units ) .",
    "we use fabry - perot interferometry , which combined the high spatial sampling with large field of view , an ideal combination for studying extended objects such as galaxies .",
    "we aim to study a sample of 9 late - type spiral galaxies ( ngc  3049 , ngc  4294 , ngc  4519 , ngc  4654 , ngc  5371 , ngc  5921 , ngc  5964 , ngc  7479 , ngc  7741 ) , all observed with the fantomm fabry - perot interferometer ( hernandez et al . 2003 ) at the 3.6 meter canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "the observations yiel the ideal combination of the spatial coverage and resolution by covering a field of @xmath0 with angular resolution of 048/pixel .",
    "fantomm is optimized for targeting the 6562.8   h@xmath1 emission - line , which we use to study the dynamics of the star - forming gas .",
    "the data are reduced homogenously , both following the standard data reduction packages and the improved idl - based reduction package developed by daigle et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : n4519 ] , we illustrate the derived maps for one example in our sample of 9 galaxies ( ngc  4519 ) .",
    "the velocity fields are used to analyze the rotational components by means of tilted - ring and harmonic decomposition techniques ( e.g. , fathi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the rotation curve is in turn used to derive the angular frequencies and the effects of gravitational perturbations on the evolution of structures in the disk . in conjunction with hii region catalogues ,",
    "we are then able to extract and quantify the kinematic effects of individual hii regions , and to separate these from the role of the gravitational perturbations on the observed velocity fields .",
    "moreover , by averaging the velocity dispersion maps along elliptic annuli , we are able to derive the h@xmath1-emitting gas velocity dispersion profiles to study the effect of feedback and disk heating mechanisms as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "the data analysis methods have been applied on the nearby late - type spiral galaxy , m  74 , and the utility of the codes are presented in detail in fathi et al ."

    "<S> the latter , in turn , could help build a pseudo - bulge . in the second paper in this series , we will apply the kinematic analysis tools to a sample of 9 late - type spiral galaxies observed with the fantomm fabry - perot spectrometer at the canada - france - hawaii telescope . </S>"
