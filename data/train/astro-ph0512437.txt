    "the band - dropout method has proven an impressive means for discovering high redshift objects . pioneered by guhathakurta ( 1990 ) , bithell ( 1991 ) , and steidel & hamilton ( 1992 , 1993 ) , the method exploits the downward step in flux shortward of the lyman limit for discovering starburst galaxies .",
    "absorption by intervening hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) will similarly produce extremely red optical colours for objects at @xmath4 , a characteristic signature of a high redshift system ( bithell 1991 ; madau 1995 ) .",
    "following steidel & hamilton s discovery of a population of lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 , the method has evolved into a standard tool for identifying even higher redshift objects in recent very deep surveys like the hubble deep field and the ultra - deep field . while follow - up spectroscopy has demonstrated that most of the objects are galaxies , a few dozen reveal the emission line signatures of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( steidel 2002 ) , about half of which have the narrow lines characteristic of type  ii systems .",
    "these agn have made possible the first measurement of the faint end of the luminosity function of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) at @xmath5 ( hunt 2004 ) , critical for assessing the poorly constrained contribution of qsos to the uv ionizing background at this epoch ( meiksin 2005a ) .    since then , band - dropout objects have been discovered in a host of surveys , most recently pushing to @xmath6 ( stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; bouwens 2004 ; bunker 2004 ; yan & windhorst 2004 ; giavalisco 2004 ) .",
    "the objects have generally been modelled as young star - forming galaxies and used to infer the cosmic star formation rate of the universe and its evolution .",
    "they have also been used to assess the contribution of galaxies to the budget of ionizing photons required to re - ionize the universe , concluding their numbers are either too few ( bunker 2004 ) or easily adequate ( stiavelli 2004 ) , depending on model assumptions .    in this paper , it is suggested that a portion of the band - dropout objects may be type ii qsos .",
    "the prospects of detecting type ii qsos in deep surveys has not previously been explored .",
    "these objects have been of considerable recent interest because they are predicted in unification models of agn ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "discovering examples at higher redshifts would help to further elucidate their properties and their connection to type i qsos . as sources of energetic photons ,",
    "they are also candidate sources for high energy background radiations .",
    "obscured qsos have been postulated as sources of the hard x - ray background ( madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ) , and type ii qsos are natural candidates for such sources .",
    "while type i qsos may dominate the uv ionizing metagalactic background at @xmath7 , their numbers appear inadequate at higher redshifts ( eg , meiksin 2005a ) . although galaxies are possible sources , the abundance of high redshift type ii qsos is far too uncertain to rule out an ionizing background dominated by agn sources . if their numbers are sufficiently great at high redshifts , type ii qsos may also have contributed substantially to the re - ionization of the igm . indeed , if the igm were re - ionized at @xmath8 , consistency with measurements of the optical depth of the igm at @xmath9 favour hard ionizing sources like pop  iii stars and agn ( meiksin 2005a ) .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "has discovered nearly 300 type ii qsos over the redshift range @xmath10 , with the rest wavelengths of the measured spectra restricted to being longward of about 2100    ( zakamska 2003 ) .",
    "these elusive narrow - lined objects have proven even more difficult to discover at higher redshifts , and their uv spectral properties are consequently still poorly understood . to date , only four type ii qsos are known to exist at @xmath11 with optical spectra showing narrow emission lines , two discovered through observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( norman 2002 ; mainieri 2005 ) , one discovered as an optical band - dropout ( stern 2002 ) , and one discovered through optical spectroscopy ( jarvis 2005 ) .",
    "a fifth candidate was found by dawson et al ( 2001 ) , but with incomplete emission line results reported .",
    "the discovery of high redshift counterparts would add substantially to our knowledge of the nature and origin of these systems .",
    "to more clearly delineate the differences between the predicted colours of type ii qsos and other possible sources , the colours of starburst galaxies and type i qsos are also considered .",
    "stanway , mcmahon & bunker ( 2005 ) previously considered starbursts as the origin of their @xmath1-drops found in the hubble ultra - deep field ( udf ) , and found they were unable to match the colours of the bluest sources in @xmath12 , including a population of blue sources too dim to measure in @xmath13 but for which colours are inferred from image stacking .",
    "their results are confirmed and slightly extended here .",
    "bouwens discovered @xmath0-dropouts in the udf with similarly blue @xmath12 colours .",
    "the @xmath1-drops detected in the udf by bunker ( 2004 ) and yan & windhorst ( 2004 ) are also considered , as are the @xmath1-drops reported by stanway , bunker & mcmahon ( 2003 ) and eyles ( 2005 ) as part of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) .",
    "the starbursts models used here were generated using the starburst99 package of leitherer ( 1999 ) .",
    "continuous star formation is assumed with a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "nebular emission lines are included .",
    "solar metallicity is assumed , although the colour results below are not very sensitive to the metallicity .",
    "for instance , using a metallicity of 0.05 solar reduces @xmath14 for a 30  myr starburst at @xmath6 by less than 0.01  mag below the value for solar metallicity and @xmath12 by less than 0.1  mag .",
    "colours are presented in the figures below for ages of 30  myr and 600  myr , which is just under the age of the universe at @xmath15 for a cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the type i qso spectrum adopted is the median spectrum constructed by vanden berk ( 2001 ) from the sdss qso survey . it is a composite of over 2200 spectra homogeneously selected from the sdss qso survey covering the redshift range @xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum covers the rest wavelength range @xmath20   .",
    "while the colours of type i qsos will show a fairly wide spread , as investigated by chiu ( 2005 ) , the median composite is a good indicator of the locus of a type i qso in colour space .    since no flux - calibrated spectra of type ii qsos exist that clearly reveal the continuum over an extended wavelength range , a type ii prototype spectrum is constructed from measured broad band magnitudes and emission lines .",
    "in addition to having narrower emission lines , there is an indication in the literature that some type ii qsos differ from type i qsos in another fundamental aspect :  several of the emission lines appear often to have high equivalent widths comparable to the filter bandwidths .",
    "this will give them unusual colours , especially at high redshifts , since the emission lines will dominate the continuum light in a given passband .",
    "it is the observational consequences of this particular feature of some type ii qsos that is emphasized in this paper , although low equivalent width type ii qsos are also considered .    estimating the contribution of the emission lines to the type ii qso colours , however , has several uncertainties .",
    "the spectra and photometry are measured through different size apertures .",
    "this requires an aperture correction for which an arbitrary assumption must be made regarding any possible spatial variation of the light in the emitting regions .",
    "norman  show substantial corrections to the measured magnitudes of a type ii qso after removing the emission lines .",
    "unfortunately they do not indicate the size of the aperture correction they must have used .",
    "the weaknesses of the reported flux values of the emission lines compared with the broadband - integrated fluxes show , however , that an aperture correction of @xmath21 must have been applied , which seems rather high .",
    "the mainieri qso has low equivalent width emission lines , so that its spectrum will differ little from that of an agn - hosting ulirg like ngc  6240 when boosted to higher redshifts , which well matches the colours measured by mainieri the jarvis qso is at too low a redshift to detect ly@xmath22 .",

    "parameters with colons indicate uncertain measurements .",

    ", cxo  52 ( @xmath23 ) provides all the requirements for constructing a type ii qso spectrum in the uv with high equivalent width emission lines .",
    "the emission line properties they fit are shown in table  [ tab : emlines ] .",
    "it should be noted that the published table  2 in stern contains a misprint in the column heading for the equivalent widths , mistakenly indicating they are in the rest frame when in fact they are in the observer s frame ( d. stern personal communication ) .",
    "the emission lines were measured from a spectrum taken through a 1.5x 1.5   aperture .",
    "the magnitudes reported are for a 3   diameter aperture . without detailed surface brightness profiles of the continuum and emission line emitting regions",
    ", it is not possible to make an assumption - free comparison of the overall contribution of the emission lines to the broadband fluxes . in particular , the optical broadband flux densities in table 1 of stern indicate flux levels of about @xmath24 , while the optical spectrum in their figure 3 shows a continuum level of about @xmath25 .",
    "except possibly for ly@xmath22 , the quoted equivalent widths in their table 2 are too small for the emission lines to dominate the broadband optical magnitudes , so that the difference in the broadband and spectral continuum flux levels indicates that the continuum extends beyond the 1.5x 1.5   slit .",
    "it is consequently necessary to make some assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of the emission line and continuum emitting regions to infer the contribution of the emission lines to the broadband colours .",
    "the emitting region in figure 5 of stern clearly extends beyond the 1.5x 1.5   aperture .",
    "although the emission - line region may peak within the 1.5x 1.5   aperture , its surface brightness distribution is unknown .",
    "if shallow , it is still possible that the integrated flux of the emission - line region continues to increase substantially beyond the slit .",
    "the assumption adopted here is that the line - emitting region fills the 3   aperture used for the broadband magnitudes , and an aperture correction is applied assuming uniform surface brightness .",
    "the aperture - corrected emission line fluxes are then removed from the broadband magnitude measurements to infer the levels of the underlying continuum .",
    "the spectrum is then constructed by fitting power - laws between the values of the continuum at the effective wavelengths of each filter , adjusting the values to match the measured magnitudes after re - introducing the emission lines .",
    "because some of the magnitude measurements correspond to rest wavelengths shortward of ly@xmath22 , the spectrum is corrected for igm absorption using the values from meiksin ( 2005b ) .",
    "the shortest wavelengths are synthesized by extending the uv portion of the spectrum to the x - ray using the measured _ chandra _ flux in the @xmath26  kev band ( stern ) .",
    "the intrinsic and predicted magnitudes , including igm attenuation , are compared with those measured in figure  [ fig : mags ] .",
    "also shown are the continuum levels inferred from the measured fluxes and equivalent widths of the optical emission lines reported by stern the continuum levels are shown at the line centres and corrected to a 3  aperture .",
    "agreement with the continuum levels inferred from the emission - line subtracted broadband fluxes is good , although the emission line - inferred continuum levels are somewhat high near restframe @xmath27 m .    in terms of the relative contribution of the emission lines to the continuum",
    ", the above procedure is equivalent to assuming a constant surface brightness for the continuum , aperture - corrected downwards to the 1.5x 1.5   spectroscopic slit , although this would then require the corresponding correction be applied to the quoted total broadband magnitudes .",
    "it should be clear that the total magnitudes being presented here are based on apertures that are filled by the emission - line emitting regions .",
    "should the continuum extend well beyond the emission line regions , then magnitudes measured through apertures larger than the emission - line regions will be more weighted toward the continuum . as the apertures used for broadband optical magnitude measurements with _",
    "hst _ typically have diameters of 0.5- 1.0 , this is not generally expected to be a major complication , although it will obviously depend on the properties of each source .",
    "the and @xmath28 lines detected by stern lie within the @xmath29 band for the qso .",
    "these lines , after aperture - correcting , are , within the errors , able to account fully for the measured @xmath29 magnitude .",
    "it is consequently not possible to make a firm continuum estimate for the qso at these wavelengths , nor a reliable estimate for the aperture - corrected equivalent widths of these lines .",
    "although @xmath29 predictions are made below at higher redshifts , these predictions are quite uncertain for @xmath30 , being based almost entirely on the aperture - corrected fluxes of these three lines .",
    "since the longest wavelength near - infra - red continuum point that is firmly established is based on observations through the @xmath31 filter , the @xmath29 predictions are in fact fairly uncertain up to @xmath32 .",
    "the equivalent widths inferred for the emission lines in a 3   aperture are provided in table  [ tab : emlines ] .",
    "it should be noted that while the equivalent widths are similar to those reported by stern et al .",
    ", a few are larger",
    ". this may be a consequence of the aperture correction applied to the emission lines . under the alternative view of aperture correcting the broadband continuum magnitudes from the 3   diameter aperture to the 1.5x 1.5   slit",
    ", the equivalent widths would be expected to be the same .",
    "it is possible that the equivalent width errors quoted in table 2 of stern are underestimates , as they appear only to account for the errors in the measured emission line fluxes , not for the errors in the fit continuum levels .",
    "the spectrum shown in their figure 3 suggests the continuum is comparable to the noise level , so that the continuum error may be large . in any case , the purpose here is not to provide a definitive spectrum , but a plausible one consistent with the data .",
    "the effect of varying the strengths of the emission lines on the predicted colours will be considered below to allow for the uncertainty in their equivalent widths , as well as possible source metallicity variations .    as a contrast to cxo  52 , a spectrum for the type ii qso cdfs-263 at @xmath33 with low equivalent width emission lines discovered by mainieri is also synthesized , using exactly the same procedure as for cxo  52 .",

    "type ii qsos in the redshift range @xmath100 will appear unusually blue in @xmath96 , those in the redshift range @xmath101 will appear unusually red in @xmath96 , and those in the redshift range @xmath102 will appear unusually blue in @xmath96 and red in @xmath97 .",
    "those at @xmath37 will appear as @xmath103-dropouts that are unusually blue in @xmath97 , of which those with @xmath104 will appear unusually red in @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath99 colours also suggest lower redshift type ii qsos may be selected as unusually red for @xmath105 and unusually blue for @xmath106 ; however , as noted above , the @xmath107-band magnitude predictions are very uncertain for @xmath108 .",
    "spectra for type ii qsos are synthesized based on observed spectra and photometric measurements , and colours predicted at higher redshifts .",
    "the possibility that some type ii qsos have high equivalent widths suggests unusual colours may be expected for these objects , distinct from type i qsos and starbursts .",
    "it is shown that the colours of the @xmath0-dropouts discovered in the udf by bouwens are matched by type ii qsos , as are some of the @xmath1-drops found in the udf and goods . in the case of @xmath1-drops ,",
    "the large but measurable @xmath34 colour is achievable in only narrow redshift windows , one at @xmath109 when the objects abruptly become @xmath1-dropouts , and a second near @xmath55 for which @xmath49 .",
    "it may seem unlikely to find such objects given their rarity at lower redshifts .",
    "it should , however , be noted that even at low redshifts , type ii agn appear to be a factor of a few to as much as an order of magnitude more abundant than type i agns at low luminosities ( martnez - sansigre 2005 ; simpson 2005 ) .",
    "the luminosity function of low - luminosity type i qsos at high redshifts is unknown .",
    "an estimate is made by meiksin ( 2005a ) , under the assumptions of either pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) or pure density evolution ( pde ) , based on the low luminosity qso counts of hunt ( 2004 ) at @xmath5 and the bright qsos detected at high redshift ( @xmath110 ) by the sdss ( fan 2001 , 2004 ) . using the maximum likelihood ple model of meiksin ( 2005a ) ( as given in his table  1 )",
    ", the predicted number of type i qsos at @xmath111 in the @xmath112 of the udf with @xmath113 is about 0.07 ( 0.002 in the pde model , as the udf should probe well below the knee in the luminosity function in this model ) .",
    "thus the number of detectable type ii qsos in the udf is expected to lie in the range @xmath114 . within the @xmath115 of the goods - s acs field",
    ", the number of @xmath116 type i qsos at @xmath111 is predicted in the ple model to be 0.6 ( 0.03 in the pde model ) , and a number per unit redshift of @xmath117 for @xmath118 ( 0.1 in the pde model ) . thus detecting at least one type ii qso is possible ,",
    "although several may be unlikely .",
    "but this is one reason why searching for them is of such interest .",
    "for instance , if most galaxies went through an agn phase early in their histories , then , in agn unification scenarios , most would appear as dim type ii objects .",
    "if they went through the agn phase at @xmath109 , then their numbers may be larger than the above estimates , and a few to several may be detectable in the udf and goods fields , sufficient to provide a subtantial fraction of the photons required to re - ionize the igm ( meiksin 2005a ) .",
    "although the ukidss ultra deep survey is a somewhat shallower survey , the relatively large survey area of @xmath119 yields a detectable number of type i qsos :  about six are predicted at @xmath111 for @xmath120 by the ple model , and @xmath121 at @xmath118 .",
    "several type ii qsos may thus be detectable at these redshifts .",
    "while the predicted numbers of type i qsos are substantially reduced under the pde model , about 0.4 at @xmath111 and @xmath122 at @xmath118 , the ultra deep survey should prove an effective means for determining which of these models more closely describes the actual evolution of qsos .    without follow - up spectroscopy , it is difficult to distinguish a starburst from an agn .",
    "the images of the band - dropout objects tend to be compact ( eg , stanway 2004a ) , as would be expected for regions , but also for an agn , so images may not readily be used to distinguish starbursts from agns .",
    "extended emission would not necessary preclude an agn nature either , both because the emitting regions extend from scales of several to a few tens of kiloparsecs in size ( hines 1999 ) and because some may be embedded in starbursts and so have multiple bright emitting regions ; both agn and starbursts are generally believed to be triggered by merger activity . even with spectroscopy , high equivalent width type ii qsos at @xmath57 could still masquerade as starbursts , with emission being mistaken for at @xmath123 . strong emission , falling at @xmath74 , could also mimic the 4000   break of a starburst at @xmath123 .",
    "even if emission is correctly identified , the absence of emission does not preclude a type ii qso , as it would a type i qso , since the to ratio in type ii qsos is observed sometimes to be very large .",
    "the absence of x - ray emission also may not necessarily exclude an agn nature .",
    "the expected x - ray flux appears to cover a broad range for a given uv flux .",
    "the ratio of restframe 5.4  kev to 1915   fluxes ( @xmath124 ) is 0.45 for cxo  52 , and the ratio of restframe 25.7  kev to 1915   fluxes is 4.6 ( stern ) .",
    "the corresponding values for cdfs-263 are an order of magnitude lower , with a ratio of restframe 5.8  kev to 1957   fluxes of 0.05 and of restframe 27.9  kev to 1957   fluxes of 0.16 ( mainieri ) .",
    "the 2  ms deep exposure by _",
    "chandra _ has a lower flux limit for the detection of sources of @xmath125 in the @xmath26  kev ( soft ) band and @xmath126 in the @xmath127  kev ( hard ) band , depending on position ( alexander private communication as quoted in stanway 2004b ) . at @xmath6 ,",
    "this implies a source like cxo  52 would need to have an ab magnitude at 1.3  @xmath128 m ( observed ) of about @xmath129 to be detectable in the x - ray , while a source like cdfs-263 would need to be 2.5 or more magnitudes brighter .",
    "this is comparable to or somewhat brighter than the @xmath130- and @xmath131-band detection limits of the deep surveys used to detect the band - dropout objects .    although genuine high redshift band - dropout objects are almost certainly dominated by starbursts , the possibility that a few are agn can have major implications for the re - ionization of the igm .",
    "the potentially important role played by agns in re - ionizing the universe may be demonstrated by comparing the numbers of uv ionizing photons generated by black holes and by stars through the lifetime of the universe .",
    "the specific luminosity of an agn at the lyman edge is @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the bolometric luminosity of the agn and @xmath134 is the frequency of the lyman edge .",
    "the production rate of ionizing photons is then @xmath135 ( meiksin 2005a ) , where @xmath136 is the planck constant . assuming a conversion efficiency @xmath137 of mass into energy for accretion onto a black hole , the global comoving number density of ionizing photons produced by black hole accretion in the universe changes at the rate @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the rate at which the average comoving mass density of black holes in the universe increases with time ( assumed largely due to accretion ) .",
    "the efficiency of mass conversion is unknown , but phenomenological estimates are in the range @xmath140 ( eg , yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "the production rate of ionizing photons by stars is sensitive to the initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars and to their metallicities . for a salpeter imf with metallicity 20% of solar ,",
    "the results of smith , norris & crowther ( 2002 ) correspond to a production rate of ionizing photons per solar mass of stars formed of @xmath141 . for solar metallicity ,",
    "the production rate is a factor of 3 smaller , while it may be somewhat larger for pop  iii stars .",
    "the comoving number density of ionizing photons produced by stars then changes at the rate @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the rate at which the average comoving mass density of stars in the universe increases with time .",
    "the number of ionizing photons available to re - ionize the igm is reduced by internal absorption , both in an agn and in a star - forming galaxy . denoting the escape fractions from agn and galaxies by @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively",
    ", the ratio of the ionization rate of the igm by black holes to that by stars is @xmath146 here , the approximation is made that @xmath147 , averaged over the age of the universe , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the respective mass densities of qso black holes and in stars in the universe today .",
    "this seems a reasonable approximation to make since the inferred growth time of a central massive black hole in a galaxy is comparable to that of the stars in the bulge over a broad range of bulge masses , at least in the present - day universe ( heckman 2004 ) .",
    "estimates for the current mass densities in qso black holes and stars are @xmath150 ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) and @xmath151 ( baldry & glazebrook 2003 ) , both for @xmath18 .",
    "the escape fraction of ionizing photons from agn is unknown , but their spectra suggest at least half escape , so @xmath152 is assumed .",
    "the observational upper limit on the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies is @xmath153 ( fernandez - soto , lanzetta & chen 2002 ) .",
    "this then gives for the ratio of igm ionizing photons produced by black holes to that produced by stars @xmath154 despite the low number of black holes compared with stars , their higher mass - to - energy conversion efficiency compared with stellar nuclear fusion and the larger escape fraction from agn compared with galaxies make black holes competitive with stars as candidate sources for the photons which re - ionized the igm .",
    "the relative ionization rates may be related to the relative fractions of objects detected in deep surveys as follows .",
    "defining @xmath155 and @xmath156 to be the fraction of band - dropout objects that are agns and starbursts , respectively , @xmath157 the intrinsic ratio of flux densities at the lyman edge and a fiducial frequency @xmath158 normalising the counts of objects , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 the respective effective spectral indices of agn and starbursts shortward of the lyman edge , then the ratio of ionizing photon rates of agn to starbursts injected into the igm is @xmath161 here , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the respective escape fractions of ionizing photons from the observed agn and starbursts .",
    "the mean observed agn escape fraction in particular is expected to be much smaller than the mean black hole escape fraction above because the contribution from type ii agn is expected to be very small .",
    "the only ionizing photons that may be observed from type ii agn are those re - emitted from the emission line gas illuminated by the central engine :  the direct ionizing photons will be obscured .",
    "if only type i agn are counted in eq .",
    "[ eq : ndotratio_obs ] , then @xmath164 may be taken to refer only to these objects , so that @xmath165 , although it should be noted that the amount of re - radiated ionizing photons from type ii agn is unknown and may not be completely negligible .",
    "it will also be assumed that @xmath166 . for pop  iii stars and hard spectra agn ,",
    "@xmath167 is expected , while for pop  ii stars , @xmath168 is expected ( meiksin 2005a ) , while soft spectra agn may have @xmath169 .",
    "further uncertainty arises from the ratio of the flux @xmath170 at the lyman limit to the flux @xmath171 measured most near the lyman limit . but these likely combine to an uncertainty of a factor of only a few .",
    "the dominant uncertainty is @xmath172 . for escape fractions of @xmath152 and @xmath173 , only about one object in a dozen , with an uncertainty of a factor of at least a few , need by an agn for agn to compete with starbursts as the dominant source of ionizing photons .",
    "a further implication of a substantial agn contribution to the re - ionization of the igm is that the post - reionization temperature will be substantially boosted if the agn are sufficiently hard to ionize to as well , which current agn number counts suggest they may be able to do by @xmath174 ( meiksin 2005a ) .    ultimately , combining _",
    "hst _ observations of @xmath0-dropouts with future follow - up _ jwst _ imaging to detect high redshift type ii agn may be the best means of settling the question of how prevalent type ii qsos are at high redshifts .",
