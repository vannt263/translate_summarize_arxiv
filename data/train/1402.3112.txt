    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , triple and quartic interactions of the gauge bosons have not been determined with great accuracy .",
    "the possible deviation of gauge boson self - interactions from the sm predictions will be an important sign of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "assuming that the energy scale associated with the new physics is sufficiently high compared to the masses of the gauge bosons , we are motivated to use effective lagrangian method @xcite , which is model independent and can converge to the sm at lower energy scale .",
    "the aqgcs are parameterized by effective operators which do not induce new trilinear gauge couplings .",
    "therefore , we consider that aqgcs can be examined independently from the effects induced by trilinear gauge couplings .    in the literature ,",
    "the aqgc operators have been described by either linear or non - linear effective lagrangians .",
    "while non - linear effective lagrangians have dimension 6 , linear effective lagrangians have dimension 8 .",
    "however , the dimension 6 lagrangian only contains vertices with two photons . assuming that there is no higgs boson in the low energy spectrum we employ a nonlinear representation of the spontaneously broken @xmath14 gauge symmetry .",
    "c and p conserving non - linear effective lagrangian for @xmath4 aqgcs are given by @xcite    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is @xmath19 triplet , @xmath20 is the tensor for electromagnetic field strength , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the dimensionless .",
    "@xmath23 is a mass - dimension parameter associated with the energy scale of the new degrees of freedom which have been integrated out .",
    "in addition , the dimension 8 lagrangian induces quartic couplings among the neutral gauge bosons and it is obtained by using a linear representation of @xmath14 gauge symmetry that is broken by the conventional sm higgs mechanism . however , after the recent discovery of a new particle which is consistent with the sm higgs boson , it becomes important to examine aqgcs based on linear effective lagrangian . on the other hand , since many aqgc - related studies have been generally investigated using non - linear effective lagrangian , which we also choose in our aqgc study . in addition , our limits can compare with the results of the linear parameterizations which is published by cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the non - linear effective lagrangian can be expressed by the linear effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "therefore , aqgc parameters obtained from non - linear operators can be easily translated into parameters of linear operator .    in effective lagrangian approach ,",
    "the cross sections of aqgc processes increase with the coupling strength , and hence unitarity is violated for sufficiently high energy collisions . as stated by ref .",
    "@xcite , a plausible choice of form factor can really provide the unitarity requirement .",
    "form factor formalism is commonly described by the formula @xcite    @xmath24    where @xmath23 represents new physics scale . however , because of selection of form factor is arbitrary in the literature , we will examine aqgc parameters without using any form factor in this study .    in the presence of the effective lagrangian in eqs.(2 - 3 ) , the vertex functions for @xmath25",
    "are obtained respectively by    @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath4 aqgcs were examined in opal , d0 and cms experiments .",
    "the @xmath8 c. l. limits on aqgcs @xmath9 and @xmath10 through the processes @xmath5 and @xmath28 by the opal collaboration at lep2 collider are given by @xmath29 tev@xmath12 , @xmath30 tev@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "also , the current limits on aqgcs @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been provided through the processes @xmath31 by d0 collaboration at the tevatron @xcite and cms collaboration at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the aqgc limits obtained by d0 collaboration are @xmath32 @xmath33    the most restrictive limits on the parameters of @xmath4 aqgcs were determined by cms collaboration @xmath34 @xmath35    in the literature , @xmath4 aqgcs at the linear colliders were studied through the processes @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 @xcite , and @xmath39 @xcite , where @xmath40 or @xmath41 and @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , these couplings were examined at the lhc via the processes @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 @xcite , @xmath46 @xcite and @xmath47 @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we probe the @xmath4 aqgcs by analyzing three different processes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 at the clic",
    ".    the lhc may not be the best platform to investigate genuine quartic gauge couplings due to remnants of usual @xmath48 deep inelastic processes .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fundamental particles , lepton colliders can determine aqgc parameters with much higher precision measurements than hadron colliders .",
    "the clic , which has high energy and luminosity , is one of the foreseen linear colliders .",
    "it is designed to be running at three center - of - mass energy stages : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 tev @xcite .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the three energy stages are given in table i. in the clic s first energy stage , it provides good opportunities for the precise measurements of different observables and characteristics of the sm higgs boson , top quark and gauge bosons , etc .. the second phase will further open the window to the discovery of new physics beyond the sm . in addition , higgs boson properties such as the higgs self - coupling and rare higgs decay modes will be examined .",
    "the third phase , which has a maximum energy of @xmath3 tev , is considered to be able to make the most precise measurements of the sm , and to directly determine the pair - production of new heavy particles with masses up to @xmath2 tev @xcite .",
    "the linear @xmath0 collider also has @xmath51 and @xmath52 run modes to examine the new physics search . in @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "run modes , high energy real photons can be obtained by converting the incoming leptons beam into a photon beam via the compton backscattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "in addition , the linear collider allows us to study photon - induced @xmath53 and @xmath54 reactions arising from almost real photons . here",
    ", @xmath55 is emitted by any of the incoming lepton immediately after it collides with the other lepton .",
    "hence , it is possible to investigate @xmath53 and @xmath54 collisions at the clic .",
    "the photons in these processes have been described as a suitable framework by the weizsaecker - williams approximation ( wwa ) @xcite .",
    "wwa is used to define processes of electro - production in the case of very small angle of @xmath49 or @xmath49 scattering . in this instance , since the virtuality of photon emitted from incoming leptons in wwa is very low , it is assumed to be on the mass shell .",
    "it gives a possibility to reduce the process of electro - production to the photo - production one with an appropriate photon spectrum . as a result , @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 processes are produced in a natural way from the @xmath0 process itself .",
    "the diagrams defining these processes are presented in fig . @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in the literature ,",
    "photon - induced reactions through the wwa have been widely examined at the lep , tevatron , and lhc @xcite .",
    "the processes @xmath5 and the subprocesses @xmath58 , and @xmath59 at the clic are described by tree - level feynman diagrams in figs .",
    "we can see from these figures that only one of these diagrams involves anomalous @xmath4 vertex while the others show the contributions arising from the sm .",
    "we have used the comphep-4.5.1 program for numerical calculations in this study @xcite . in our study , only one aqgc coefficient is set to 0 at one time while the other one is set to non - zero .",
    "the total cross sections as functions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 aqgcs for these processes at the clic with @xmath61 and @xmath3 tev are given in figs .",
    "we observe from figs . @xmath62-@xmath63",
    "that the cross section values induced by non - zero @xmath9 are larger than the values of the @xmath10 coupling .",
    "hence , the obtained limits on the @xmath9 coupling are anticipated to be more restrictive than the limits on @xmath10 coupling .",
    "during statistical analysis , we determined @xmath8 c.l .",
    "limits on the aqgc parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 using a simple one - parameter @xmath64 analysis .",
    "the @xmath64 analysis is defined by the following formula    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the sm cross section , @xmath67 is the total cross section with aqgc , @xmath68 is the statistical error : @xmath69 is the number of events .",
    "first , the number of events for the process @xmath5 is given by    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the integrated luminosity and @xmath66 is the sm cross section . the @xmath72 boson is heavy enough to decay both hadronically and leptonically .",
    "it decays approximately @xmath73 of the time leptonically ( for electron or muon ) and @xmath74 of the time to hadrons @xcite .",
    "so we consider one of the @xmath72 bosons decays leptonically and the other hadronically for the signal .",
    "therefore , we consider that the branching ratio of the @xmath72 bosons pairs in the final state to be @xmath75 . in addition , we impose the acceptance cuts on the pseudorapidity @xmath76 and the transverse momentum @xmath77 gev for the final state photon . after applying these cuts ,",
    "the sm background cross sections in the process @xmath5 , we obtain as @xmath78 pb at @xmath79 tev , @xmath80 pb at @xmath81 tev , and @xmath82 pb at @xmath83 tev .    in table ii , we calculate limits on the aqgc parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 for various integrated luminosities and center - of - mass energies of the process @xmath5 .",
    "we observe from table ii that the obtained limits on the aqgcs via the process @xmath5 with @xmath79 tev are less restrictive than the best limits attained by the current experimental limits . on the other hand ,",
    "our limits at @xmath2 and @xmath3 tev of center - of - mass energies of the same process are , even with low integrated luminosities , more restrictive than the experimental limits .",
    "especially , we have found the limits of the @xmath9 aqgc as @xmath84 $ ] tev@xmath12 while the limits on @xmath10 aqgc as @xmath85 $ ] tev@xmath12 at the integrated luminosity of @xmath86 fb@xmath87 and center - of - mass energy of @xmath3 tev .    in the second analysis ,",
    "the number of events for the process @xmath6 is obtained as    @xmath88    here , the @xmath72 boson can decay leptonically , but in this case , it will introduce a great uncertainty due to the production of two neutrinos in the final state of our process . for this reason , we consider the hadronic decay of the @xmath72 boson . also , we apply the cuts @xmath77 gev and @xmath76 for the photon in the final state . therefore , we calculate the sm cross sections as @xmath89 pb at @xmath79 tev , @xmath90 pb at @xmath81 tev , and @xmath91 pb at @xmath83 tev . we show the limits on the @xmath9 and @xmath10 aqgcs for the process @xmath6 at various integrated luminosities and center - of - mass energies in table iii . as we can see from this table , the best limits obtained on @xmath9 and @xmath10 aqgcs through process @xmath6 are found to be @xmath92 $ ] tev@xmath12 and @xmath93 $ ] tev@xmath12 , respectively for @xmath94 fb@xmath87 and @xmath83 tev at the clic .",
    "finally , for the process @xmath7 , in order to get promising results the number of events is obtained as    @xmath95    here ,",
    "we find the sm cross sections to be @xmath96 pb for @xmath79 tev , @xmath97 pb for @xmath81 tev , and @xmath98 pb for @xmath83 tev . in table iv , we give the limits of the @xmath9 and @xmath9 aqgcs for @xmath7 at clic at @xmath99 and @xmath3 tev . as shown in all these tables , we realize that the sensitivities of @xmath9 and @xmath10 aqgcs are rapidly enhanced when the center - of - mass energy of the clic increases .",
    "in addition , the combined limits obtained on @xmath9 and @xmath10 aqgcs through three different processes with the integrated luminosity of @xmath94 fb@xmath87 at the clic with @xmath83 tev are calculated as @xmath100 $ ] tev@xmath12 and @xmath101 $ ] tev@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the combined limits are worse than the limits derived in the process @xmath5 since the other two processes have worse limits .",
    "the clic is a future linear collider at the planning stage .",
    "having it running with high energy and high luminosity is quite important new physics research beyond the sm .",
    "@xmath4 aqgcs are defined by dimension 6 effective lagrangians , which have very strong energy dependences .",
    "hence , @xmath4 cross section with anomalous couplings interactions has a higher momentum dependence than the sm cross section .",
    "we can easily understand that the contribution to the cross section of aqgcs quickly increases with center - of - mass energy .",
    "the analyzed processes that have very high energy and clean experimental environment such as clic , are anticipated to be more sensitive to aqgcs .",
    "therefore , we are motivated to study the the aqgc parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 through the processes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 at the clic .",
    "we have shown that the best limits obtained on aqgcs @xmath9 and @xmath10 in these processes are at the order of @xmath11 and @xmath13 tev@xmath12 , respectively . since our limits",
    "are derived based on the total cross section with only statistical uncertainty , they is significantly better than the limits derived in experimental studies .",
