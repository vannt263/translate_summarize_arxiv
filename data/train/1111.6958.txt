    "can be tied directly to tests of the cold dark matter paradigm and simulations of the formation and evolution of dark matter halos .",
    "much has been made of the scientific potential of this technique .",
    "five years ago , weak lensing was identified by the dark energy task force @xcite as the most promising tool for constraining cosmological models .",
    "several large ground - based and space - based survey proposals place a weak lensing measurement among their primary science drivers , including the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , the dark energy survey ( des ) , the hyper suprime - cam ( hsc , @xcite ) survey , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , euclid , and the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) .",
    "for all the promise , the technical challenges for these future experiments remain formidable . an order - unity distortion to background galaxy images",

    "the critical surface density is @xmath4g@xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "typical fluctuations in the matter density field projected over cosmological distances are a thousand times smaller than this , so order 10 mpc - scale density fluctuations in the universe will typically produce changes in galaxy ellipticities of order @xmath7 to @xmath8 in magnitude . in the shot - noise dominated regime ,",
    "the leading - order contribution to the variance in the correlation function of the ellipticity distortions is @xmath9    for a shallow ( @xmath10 ) galaxy survey with shape noise due to random galaxy ellipticities @xmath11 and 100 @xmath12 of sky coverage , reducing the shot noise contribution below the expected cosmological signal requires a surface density of usable source galaxies of at least a few per square arcminute .",
    "worse , for ground - based imaging surveys , the observed shape distortions arising from atmospheric turbulence and optical distortions from the telescope are typically of order several percent , with coherence over angular scales comparable to that of the lensing shape distortions .",
    "a competitive measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations requires suppressing or modeling these coherent spurious distortions to of order one part in @xmath13 , and future surveys will need to do a factor of several better .",
    "achieving both the statistical precision and control of systematic errors that is required for such a measurement has proved to be a challenge .",
    "the early detections showed the promise of the method and confirmed the existence of lensing by large - scale structure at roughly the expected level .",
    "however , they also highlighted some of the systematic errors : in particular , @xmath14-mode shear ( which can not be produced by lensing at linear order and is thus indicative of systematic effects ) was present at a sub - dominant but non - negligible level .",
    "since then , the weak lensing community has moved in the direction of both deep / narrow surveys with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and wide / shallow surveys on the ground .",
    "the cosmological evolution survey ( cosmos ) is the premier example of the former : in addition to 2-point statistics , it has also produced three - dimensional maps of the matter distribution @xcite and the lensing 3-point correlation function @xcite .",
    "excellent control of lensing systematics in cosmos was also achieved thanks to the small number of degrees of freedom controlling the psf ( mostly focus variation ; @xcite ) and detailed modeling of charge transfer inefficiency @xcite .",
    "however , cosmos covers only 1.6 deg@xmath15 , and the small field of view of _ hst _ instruments makes significantly larger surveys impractical .",
    "the principal recent ground - based cosmic shear programme has been the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) .",
    "there are now several cosmic shear results from different subsets of the cfhtls data , and the cfht lensing team is completing a reanalysis using recent advances in psf determination and galaxy shape measurement .    in light of the efforts shortly to be made by large , expensive surveys to measure cosmic shear , we consider it imperative to show that such a measurement can be performed accurately , without significant contaminating systematic errors , from a ground - based observatory .",
    "this goal includes doing a cosmic shear measurement with each of the wide - angle optical surveys that presently exist . to this end , we have re - coadded the repeat observations on the equatorial stripe ( stripe 82 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , using methodology that will optimise these new coadds for precision shear measurements . our goal is to reduce the systematic errors arising from uncorrected psf anisotropies below the statistical errors .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "weak lensing measurements on large scales are vulnerable to a variety of systematic measurement errors . in order to measure cosmic shear on the scales described above , we must first have a clear idea of what the possible sources of these systematic errors are , and to what level ( quantitatively ) they must be suppressed .",
    "this section describes in turn the most common generic sources of measurement error relevant for weak lensing , and lays out quantitative methods for detecting their presence in our final catalogue .",
    "the psf of the sdss survey exhibits significant spatial and temporal variations across the entire survey .",
    "we model these effects as a spatially - varying convolution kernel @xmath16 .",
    "the observed image @xmath17 at some position @xmath18 is related to the `` true '' image @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath16 is the convolution kernel appropriate to the region of sky under examination .",
    "one effect of a spatially - varying psf @xmath16 is to produce a spurious shear field determined by the atmosphere and telescope that is statistically independent of and superposed upon the undistorted galaxy shape pattern .",
    "point sources ( stars and completely unresolved galaxies  we have no need , at present , to distinguish these ) sample only the field sourced by @xmath16 , and so can be used to constrain a model for the systematics field . any uncorrected additive shear contribution due to",
    "the ellipticity of @xmath16 will produce a correlation between the measured galaxy and point - source shapes .",
    "this additive shear will be statistically uncorrelated with the true cosmic shear signal .",
    "the masking steps of the catalogue construction procedure can also produce a significant shape selection bias .",
    "for the photometric pipeline used here , masked regions are defined as sets of pixels ; a galaxy is rejected from the catalogue if the set of pixels making up a galaxy intersects the set of masked pixels . on the masked region boundary ,",
    "galaxies aligned across the mask boundary are more likely to be rejected from the catalogue than galaxies aligned along it producing a spurious shear .",
    "this will affect both stars and galaxies , but the effect on spurious galaxy ellipticities will be much larger than that on stars ( as the dispersion in measured stellar ellipticities is very small ) .",
    "this mask selection bias produces an additive shear , which will also be statistically uncorrelated with the true cosmic shear signal .",
    "these two effects enter together as an additive term in the shape clustering statistics , as @xmath21    the point - source and galaxy populations have different sensitivities to the ellipticity of the psf , to optical distortions , and to the geometry of the mask .",
    "if these are accounted for , a measurement of the point source - galaxy cross correlation provides a straightforward estimate of the spurious signal sourced by uncorrected psf variation deg@xmath15 . ] .",
    "we will require that the amplitude of this spurious correlation in our final shape catalogue be sub - dominant to the statistical errors  in particular , that the additive psf systematics amplitude be constrained to less than the statistical errors .",
    "the average ellipticity measured for the gravitationally sheared images of a population of galaxies is proportional to the applied shear ; the exact value of this calibration depends on the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies .",
    "we will address the shear calibration uncertainties in a companion paper .",

    "the footprint of one night s observing is six columns of imaging the width of one ccd ( 13.52 arcmin ) separated by slightly less than one ccd width ( 11.65 arcmin ) .",
    "imaging taken during a continuous period of time on one night is collectively termed a _ run _ ; each separate column of imaging is , sensibly , a _ camera column _ ( or `` camcol '' ) , and the imaging along each camera column is chopped for processing purposes into 8.98 arcmin long _ frames _ or _",
    "fields_. successive runs are interleaved , in order to fill in the gaps between camera columns .",
    "pairs of interleaved runs along the same great circle are _ stripes _ ( each of which has a north and a south _ strip _ ) .",
    "most of the sdss imaging data were acquired in the northern galactic cap , with galactic latitude @xmath22 . for commissioning , and during sidereal times when the primary survey region was unavailable , the telescope frequently imaged a 2.5 degree wide stripe of sky along the celestial equator with right ascension ( ra ) in the interval @xmath23 .",

    "any given location on the stripe , there are on average 120 contributing interleaved imaging runs , comprising in aggregate almost as much imaging data as exist in the remainder of the combined sdss - i and sdss - ii footprint .",
    "it is here that significant gains can be made from image coaddition .",
    "the raw imaging data is processed by the automated sdss photometric pipeline , photo @xcite .",
    "this pipeline has components to handle astrometric and photometric calibration as well as catalogue construction ; it also generates an array of data quality measurements describing the telescope point - spread function ( psf ) , the locations of unreliable pixels , and measurements of the photometric quality of individual frames .",

    "these are the images that are combined during the coaddition process below .",
    "photo also generates a bitmask ( an fpm file ) for each frame describing pixels that are known to be defective .",
    "pixels are marked in this bitmask as saturated , cosmic - ray contaminated , interpolated ( if a column or pixel is known to be saturated , or is _ a priori _ marked as unreliable , photo interpolates over that region ) .",

    "is constructed by allowing the first few kl components to vary up to second order in the image coordinates across the frame , with the coefficients of the variation being tied to the aforementioned bright stars .",

    "nevertheless , a serious error in the size of the psf will result in erroneous photometry , and spurious ellipticity could introduce colour / photo-@xmath43 or selection biases that depend on galaxy orientation , so some cuts must be applied .      it is a well - known fact in weak lensing that even if the psf in an image has been corrected to have perfectly circular concentric isophotes , it is possible to produce spurious ellipticity if there is anisotropic correlated noise . for example , if the psf is elongated in the @xmath81 direction and is `` fixed '' by smoothing in the @xmath82-direction , the resulting map has more correlations in the @xmath82 direction than @xmath81 .",
    "this can lead to ( 1 ) centroiding biases , in which the error on the galaxy centroid is larger in the @xmath82 than the @xmath81 direction , thus yielding more galaxies that appear aligned in the @xmath82 than @xmath81 direction ; and ( 2 ) biases in which noise fluctuations tend to be elongated in the @xmath82 direction , so that positive noise fluctuations on top of a galaxy ( which increase its likelihood of detection ) tend to make it aligned in the @xmath82 direction whereas negative fluctuations ( which decrease the likelihood of detection ) make the galaxy aligned in the @xmath81 direction . for a detailed description of noise - induced ellipticity biases , see @xcite or @xcite .",

    "our method of doing this is to add synthetic noise to each field so as to give the noise properties 4-fold rotational symmetry . to be precise ,",
    "we want the power spectrum of the total noise ( actual plus synthetic ) to satisfy : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a vector normal to the plane of the image ; the cross product operation @xmath85 rotates a vector by 90 degrees . even though it is not circularly symmetric , this is sufficient to guarantee zero mean ellipticity for a population of randomly oriented galaxies because ellipticity reverses sign under 90 degree rotations . , which is a subgroup of the full rotations @xmath86 .",

    "since the psf and hence @xmath28 varies across the field , @xmath96 must also vary ; its value is interpolated from the same @xmath69 grid of reference points as used for @xmath28 .",
    "the gaussian white noise was generated using numerical recipes gasdev modified to use the ran2 uniform deviate generator @xcite .",
    "the seed was chosen by a formula based on the run , camcol , field number , and filter to guarantee that the same seed was never used twice in the reductions , and that the same sequence will be generated if the software is re - run .",
    "for each field , a sequence of @xmath97 gaussian deviates is generated ; since there are 128 rows of overlap between successive fields , we fill in the last 128 rows of each field with the first @xmath98 deviates from the next field .",
    "it is also essential that the period of the generator be longer than the total number of pixels in the survey ( of order a few @xmath99 ) , a requirement which is _ not _ fulfilled by many generators , since otherwise the same synthetic `` noise '' pattern will repeat itself throughout the survey .",
    "the image @xmath70 after addition of the synthetic noise is a kimage .",
    "once the kernel - convolved , noise - added image ( kimage ) is constructed for each run that will contribute to the coadds at a given position , it is necessary to construct a mask before co - addition . the mask must remove the usual image defects as well as diffraction spikes .",
    "it is constructed as described in this section , and is termed the kmask .",
    "we begin by masking out all pixels in @xmath70 for which the convolution ( eq .  [ eq : f ] ) integrates over a bad pixel . since @xmath28 has compact support ",
    "it is nonzero only in a @xmath37 pixel region ",
    "this means that for each bad pixel in @xmath17 we mask out a @xmath37 block in @xmath70 .",
    "our definition of a `` bad pixel '' is one that is out of the field ; was interpolated by photo ( usually due to being in a bad column ) ; is saturated ; is potentially affected by ghosting ( via the fpm ghost flag ) ; was not checked for objects by photo ; is determined by photo to be affected by a cosmic ray ; or had a model subtracted from it .",
    "note that the first cut means that a 6-pixel region is rejected around the edge of the field .",
    "the second and more sophisticated mask is applied to remove diffraction spikes from stars .",
    "the secondary support structure responsible for the diffraction spikes is on an altitude - azimuth mount , so that the diffraction spikes appear at position angles of 45 , 135 , 225 , and 315 degrees in the altitude - azimuth coordinate system .",
    "therefore in the equatorial runs , the orientation of the diffraction spikes relative to equatorial coordinates changes depending on the hour angle of observation .",
    "if no correction for this is made , then after co - addition of many runs , even moderately bright stars have a hedgehog - like pattern of diffraction spikes at many position angles that can affect a significant fraction of the area .    our procedure for removing diffraction spikes is as follows .",
    "we first identify objects with a psf flux ( i.e. flux defined by a fit to the psf ) exceeding some threshold ( corresponding to @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 electrons in filters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath39 , @xmath43 , and @xmath40 respectively ) . around these objects",
    ", we mask a circle of radius 20 pixels ( 8 arcsec ) and four rectangles of width 8 pixels ( 3 arcsec ) and length 60 pixels ( 24 arcsec ) .",
    "the rectangles have the object centroid at the centre of their short side , and their long axis extends radially from the centroid in the direction of the expected diffraction spike .      in order to co - add images ,",
    "we must first resample them into a common pixelization .",
    "ideally we would like this pixelization to be both conformal ( no local shape distortion ) and equal - area ( convenient for total flux measurements ) .",
    "unfortunately because the sky is curved , it is impossible to achieve both of these conditions .",
    "however since our analysis uses a narrow range of declinations around the equator ( @xmath105 ) we can come very close by choosing a cylindrical projection ; the obvious choices are mercator ( perfectly conformal ) or lambert ( perfectly equal - area ) . in our case",
    "the mercator projection would result in the pixel scale being different by @xmath106 at the equator versus at @xmath107 .",
    "( the area error is twice this , or @xmath108 . )",
    "the lambert projection would preserve shapes at the equator but the coordinate system would have a shear of @xmath109 at @xmath107 .",
    "neither of these problems is particularly serious , since either could if necessary be corrected in the flux or shape measurements .",
    "we have chosen the mercator projection because the small cosmic shear signal means that we are much more sensitive to a given percentage error in shear than in flux . also , a flux error of @xmath110 is insignificant compared to the error in the flatfields , so there is no point in eliminating it at the expense of complicating the shear analysis",
    ".    the scale of the resampled pixels must be smaller than the native pixel scale on the ccd ( @xmath111 arcsec ) in order to preserve information .",
    "however it is desirable for it not to be too small , since this increases the data volume with no increase in information content .",
    "it should also not be nearly equal to the ccd scale in order to avoid production of a moir pattern with large - scale power .",
    "we have used 0.36 arcsec .",
    "the actual resampling step requires us to interpolate the image from the native pixelization onto the target mercator pixelization .",
    "this is done by 36-point second - order polynomial interpolation on the @xmath112 grid of native pixels surrounding the target pixel . ] .",
    "a target pixel is considered masked if any of the 36 surrounding pixels are masked .",
    "after resampling the images , the next step is to combine them to produce the co - add .",
    "the combination proceeds in three steps : comparison of images to reject `` bad '' regions that were not masked in earlier stages of the analysis ; relative sky estimation ; and stacking . note that bad regions must be explicitly rejected : `` robust '' algorithms such as the median are nonlinear and slightly biased , and result in a final co - added psf that depends on object flux and morphology , which is not acceptable for lensing studies .",
    "rejection of bad regions is critical because it is possible for some serious defects such as satellite trails to `` leak through '' earlier stages of the analysis and not be kmasked .",
    "rejection at this stage is also the best way to eliminate solar system objects , most of which will be known , but which are not easily identified in the single - epoch fpcs but of course will not show up at the same coordinates in successive runs .",
    "we first bin each input image into @xmath113 resampled pixels .",
    "we then compare the binned images and reject the brightest or faintest image if it differs by more than delta_sky_max1 from the mean .",
    "when this rejection is done , we actually mask a @xmath114 resampled pixel region around the affected area .",
    "( we found that without this padding region , satellite trails were often incompletely masked because they passed through the corners of some @xmath113 regions and did not sufficiently affect the mean flux . )",
    "next we compute the difference in sky level among all of the @xmath115 images .",
    "this difference must be determined and removed because otherwise a masked pixel in an image with below - average sky will appear as a bright spot in the co - added image .",
    "we compute the relative sky level  an often - neglected step in coaddition  as follows . for each pair @xmath116 of co - added images , we compute the difference map @xmath117 and take the median in @xmath118 resampled pixel blocks .",
    "this is taken as an estimate of the sky difference @xmath119 . from these differences",
    "we obtain the unweighted least - squares solution for the sky levels @xmath120 , up to an additive offset ( the absolute sky level can not be determined by this procedure ) .",
    "the mean of these levels is denoted by @xmath121 .",
    "we add to the @xmath42th image the quantity @xmath122 interpolated to a particular point @xmath18 by 4-point interpolation from the nearest block centres .",
    "an entire block is masked out if @xmath123delta_sky_max2 and if it is an extremal value ( either the highest or lowest sky value ) .",
    "the stacking of the images works by the usual formula @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the weights . because the noise is correlated ,",
    "the optimal weights are scale - dependent ; we have chosen the optimal weights in the limit of small @xmath46 , i.e. large scales .",
    "that is , @xmath127 where @xmath90 is the noise variance in image @xmath42 . for photometry of large objects",
    ", @xmath128 can be thought of as an inverse white noise variance , i.e. the mean square noise flux in a region of area @xmath129 is @xmath130 .",
    "however for small objects ( which are always our concern ) this is not the case and the error bars must be computed from the measured noise properties of the co - add .",
    "an example of a co - added image , and comparison to a single - epoch image , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlevscoadd ] .          before constructing the photometric catalogues , we zero all pixels contaminated by bright stars in the tycho catalogues , replacing them with random noise of appropriate amplitude .",
    "pixels masked in this manner have the ` interp ' bit set in the input fpm files , so that the downstream analysis can exclude objects that incorporate pixels from a masked region .",
    "pixels that are kmasked ( according to one of the above criteria ) also have ` interp ' bits set .",
    "this final step results in a catalogue with a complex geometry , which will be demonstrated explicitly in sec .",
    "[ sec : regauss ] .      once each coadded image is constructed , we detect objects using the catalogue - construction portion of the sdss photometric pipeline , photo - frames .",
    "the details of frames s catalogue construction and object measurement process are described more fully elsewhere ( @xcite ; lupton et  al .",
    ", _ in prep .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to review the important parts of the frames algorithms .",
    "photo - frames requires as input a set of long integer images , and a considerable array of inputs describing the properties of the telescope and the observing conditions .",
    "principal among these is a description of the telescope point - spread function",
    ". for single - epoch data , frames uses a principal - component decomposition of the variation of the psf across five adjacent fields .",
    "the components of this decomposition are allowed to vary as a polynomial ( typically quadratic ) in the image coordinates across each frame . as the coadded images have the same target psf in every image , this target psf is stored as the first principal component .",
    "for fast computation of object properties , the pipeline uses a double - gaussian fit to the psf ; as this is the exact form of the target psf resulting from the rounding kernel applied above , we simply use the target psf parameters .",
    "frames first smooths the image with the narrower of the two gaussian widths describing the psf .",
    "collections of connected pixels greater than 7 times the standard deviation of the sky noise are marked as objects .",
    "each object is grown by six pixels in each direction . for each object , the list of connected pixels is then culled of peaks less than three times the local standard deviation of the sky .    in order to avoid including objects that represent random noise fluctuations , catalogue galaxies are required to have statistically significant ( @xmath131 ) detections in both the _ r _ and _ i _ bands . note that this is a higher threshold than the @xmath132 cut used at this stage in the standard single - epoch sdss processing .",
    "this was necessitated by the fact that the pixel noise in the kimages is correlated by the convolution process .    in the standard sdss pipeline , frames",
    "then re - bins the image and repeats the search . we choose not to use objects found in this manner , as the shape measurements of these very low surface brightness galaxies would not be reliable .",
    "this detection algorithm is repeated in each filter separately .",
    "objects detected in multiple bands are merged to contain the union of the pixels in each band if they overlap on the sky .",
    "the list of peak positions in each band is preserved .",
    "the centre of the resulting single object is determined by the location of the highest peak in the _ r_-band .",
    "objects with multiple peaks are deblended : the deblending algorithm assigns image flux to each peak in the parent object .",
    "once a complete list of deblended peaks ( hereafter objects ) has been constructed , the properties of each peak are measured . for the purposes of this paper , the most important outputs are the modelflux and modelflux_ivar parameters , which are determined from the total flux in the best - fit ( psf - convolved ) galaxy profile in the @xmath41 band ( comparing the likelihoods for an exponential and a de vaucouleurs model ) , with the amplitude re - fit separately to each of the other bands .",
    "this flux measure approximates the true , total flux in the _ r_-band , and provides a robust colour measurement , which is crucial for photometric estimates of the object redshift distribution .",
    "the final crucial output of photo - frames , for lensing purposes , is a postage stamp image for every unique object detected in the catalogue , except for those objects for which the deblender algorithm failed .",
    "after photo - frames has constructed an object catalogue from the coadded images , we attempt to eliminate spurious detections , stars , and galaxies that are unsuitable for shape measurement .",
    "information from the input mask ( fpm ) files is propagated through to the catalogue , so that objects that incorporate bad pixels identified earlier in the pipeline can be excluded as needed . due to the nature of the kimages produced by the image coaddition ,",
    "many of the standard sdss flags will not be used ( e.g , by construction , there are no saturated pixels ) .",
    "as we describe above , masked regions of the kimages are marked as interpolated ; objects in the photometric catalogue outputs with these bits set are removed from the catalogue at this stage .",
    "any galaxies on which the deblending algorithm failed are also excluded , as photo - frames will not generate unique postage stamps for these objects .",

    "the galactic latitudes of the two deep2 fields are -54@xmath182 and -56@xmath182 , but the `` start '' of our stripe ( ra 310@xmath182 , dec 0@xmath182 ) is at @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "these low - ra fields are not only at lower galactic latitude , but also look inward toward the bulge . as a simple test for this",
    ", we compared the ratio of the @xmath185 star density to the source galaxy density in the deep2 fields ( 0.16 ) versus the stripe as a whole ( 0.46 ) .",
    "the ratio of these suggests that the deep2 field star abundances should be scaled up by a factor of 2.8 to be representative of stripe 82 as a whole.ra@xmath186 range . ]",
    "a potential issue in this method of rescaling is that the stars of different magnitude need not be distributed in the same way . to test for this",
    ", we repeated the above computation for stars at fainter magnitudes , with @xmath187 and found a rescaling factor of 1.4 .",
    "this suggests that the larger factor is conservative , but it is also possible that the stellar density is being homogenized by galaxy contamination of the stars .",
    "the true recalibration factor for deep2 is probably greater than unity , but not larger than 2.8 .",
    "the statistical error on this contamination is @xmath188 per cent ( poisson error ) ; the systematic uncertainty in how it applies to a real lensing analysis , given the strong variation in stellar density across the stripe , is far larger .",
    "we therefore address the issue of real corrections for a lensing analysis in paper ii .",
    "we have constructed deep , lensing - optimised , coadded imaging of the sdss equatorial stripe .",
    "the procedure is designed to enable the construction of a catalogue suitable for weak lensing measurements by suppressing the effects of psf anisotropy on the measured galaxy shapes below the level of statistical error achievable with a cosmic shear survey on this stripe .",
    "the galaxy density of @xmath189 per arcmin@xmath15 is relatively low for a cosmic shear survey .",
    "however , it makes sense given our depth limits and large psf of the sdss , even by ground - based standards . as a simple point of comparison ,",
    "the cmc is commonly used to forecast galaxy yields for dark energy investigations .",
    "the effective radius of the coadded psf is 0.67 arcsec ; for gaussians one would then expect that our cut on @xmath171 should correspond to a cut on effective radius of @xmath190 arcsec . using the 2011 august 15 update of the cmc , and imposing this cut as well as @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( observer frame at @xmath193 )",
    ", we forecast a galaxy density of @xmath194 arcmin@xmath44 and a mean source redshift @xmath195 , before any small - scale masking due to e.g. bright stars and bad columns",
    ". therefore the final galaxy yield is broadly consistent with the tools being used to design next - generation surveys .",
    "this procedure is successful if and only if it renders the psf shape distortions sufficiently small that they are negligible compared to the statistical errors expected for a cosmic shear signal in this survey . to estimate the amplitude and scale - dependence of the residual psf systematics , we have measured the star - galaxy and star - star ellipticity correlation functions in our catalogue .",
    "we now fit a power law of the form : @xmath196 to the average of the four measured star - galaxy cross - correlations , using the poisson errors output by the correlation function code .",
    "the best - fitting power law and average star - galaxy correlations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sg_avg ] , with @xmath197 .    , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 star - galaxy cross - correlation functions , and the best - fit power - law from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgpowlaw ] ) . ]",
    "we compare the ratio of this best - fitting power law to the shot - noise errors expected for a galaxy shape auto - correlation function for this survey . to estimate the shot noise , we follow to calculate the statistical errors expected due to shot noise for a @xmath201 square degree lensing survey with an effective source surface density of 2 galaxies per arcmin@xmath15 : @xmath202    the ratio of the systematics amplitude to the shot noise is shown as a function of scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : sys_ratio ] . from this",
    ", we can see that psf systematics for these data should be , on average , @xmath203 per cent of the size of the statistical error budget for a cosmic shear measurement with this catalogue ; on degree scales , this becomes comparable to the shot - noise errors .        as discussed above , this is an upper limit for three reasons : ( 1 ) imperfect star - galaxy separation at the level of several to ten per cent can produce a star - galaxy correlation signal in the absence of uncorrected psf effect ; ( 2 ) the response of a galaxy shape to a psf anisotropy is typically less than unity ; and ( 3 ) the poisson error estimate will underestimate the true variance of the signal on larger scales , where cosmic variance becomes important .",
    "in addition , masks defined as sets of pixels can introduce a shape selection bias .",
    "we tested the effects of masking on the spurious shear statistics during the catalogue - making step by applying a strict cut to eliminate those regions of the coadd imaging with fewer than seven contributing single - epoch images . introducing this cut actually _ increased _ the spurious shear amplitude ; the star - galaxy correlations in the presence of this more aggressive masking step reach an amplitude of @xmath64 at degree scales .",
    "the relative contributions of mask selection and psf anisotropy biases can be ascertained from the relative amplitudes of the star - star and star - galaxy correlation functions .",
    "a psf anisotropy will produce a similar signal in both metrics .",
    "the stellar shape dispersion and typical stellar size is much smaller than that of the galaxies , so a selection bias will produce a much larger systematics signal in the star - galaxy correlation function than in the star - star correlation functions .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss - all ]  substantial evidence that mask selection bias will be a significant fraction of the systematic error budget .",
    "excluding objects near the boundaries of masked regions on the basis of their centroid positions could remove this effect ; however , as fig .",
    "[ fig : sys_ratio ] shows , the statistical errors should dominate for this catalogue , so reducing the catalogue further at this stage would not improve the quality of a final cosmic shear measurement .",
    "we also considered trying to simulate and subtract the masking bias .",
    "ultimately , however , we settled on a more empirical approach : as described in detail in paper ii , the galaxy shear autocorrelation function used in the final analysis determines and subtracts the mean @xmath144 in each declination bin .",
    "@xmath167{ss - r.ps } & \\includegraphics[width=3in , angle=0]{ss - i.ps } \\\\",
    "\\includegraphics[width=3in , angle=0]{ss - ri.ps } & \\includegraphics[width=3in , angle=0]{star_systematics_fraction.ps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    these results suggest that a cosmic shear analysis that is statistics - limited is possible with these data .",
    "we have shown that the effects of the point - spread function are small compared to the statistical errors .",
    "the mask selection bias is larger , but still on average significantly smaller than the expected statistical errors . a full analysis involving the source redshift distribution",
    ", shear calibration , and the cosmological implications of the two - point statistics of these data will follow in paper ii .",
    "the systematics floor for the rounding kernel method we have employed here is set by the sdss psf model .",
    "inaccuracies in this psf model are documented both here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : binnedstars ] ) and in other work @xcite .",
    "coherent variations in the psf model errors in both components across the camera columns are visible with a characteristic amplitude of @xmath204 .",
    "aside from the very striking and atypical effect seen in the @xmath41 band in camcol 2 , it is likely that the shortcomings of the polynomial interpolation method employed in photo play an important role here , as documented in @xcite for more general simulated ground - based data .",
    "as this is close to the level of residual psf systematics seen in our final lensing catalogue , it is very likely that an improvement in the underlying model construction would allow the rounding kernel method deployed here to achieve a greater level of systematics control .",
    "the masking problem that we have identified is not extensively treated in the literature ; to the knowledge of the authors , it has not been taken into account in existing studies . it is standard in modern photometric pipelines to define the survey mask and object rejection algorithms in terms of sets of pixels , rather than ( for example ) galaxy centroids , which is the ultimate source of the masking bias we see here .",
    "this effect will be important to take into account in the photometric pipeline construction in the next generation of lensing measurements .",
    "if possible , masking - related biases ( and more generally , survey uniformity ) should also be addressed at the observing strategy level . in this regard , the sdss stripe 82 technique of scanning the sky along the same guiding great circle many times , while appropriate for supernovae or transient searches , was highly non - optimal from the perspective of producing a uniform quality co - added image , since bad columns and other defects always occur at the same positions . even dithering successive runs in the cross - scan ( declination ) direction by of order 10",
    "arcsec would have helped this project enormously .    in paper ii",
    ", we will use the catalogue described here to measure cosmic shear . while this work was underway , we learned of a parallel effort by lin et al .",
    "these two efforts use different methods of coaddition and different sets of cuts for the input images and galaxies ; what they have in common is their use of sdss data ( not necessarily the same set of runs ) and their use of the sdss photo pipeline for the initial reduction of the single epoch data and the final reduction of the coadded data ( however , they use different versions of photo ) . using these different methods ,",
    "both groups have attempted to extract the cosmic shear signal and its cosmological interpretations .",
    "we have coordinated submission with them but have not consulted their results prior to this , so these two analysis efforts are completely independent , representing an extreme version of two independent pipelines .",
    "the psf correction method described here is suitable for deployment in the next generation of weak lensing surveys , or generally any survey with many fully sampled images of the same region .",
    "all of these surveys will include multi - epoch data over their full footprint .",
    "in many cases the image quality ( as measured by psf isotropy and size ) distribution may be fairly narrow , since the `` shape measurement '' bands will be acquired in the best seeing conditions . in these cases ,",
    "the rounding kernel method will result in little loss of information .",
