    "clusters of galaxies , the largest gravitationally - bound structures , are believed to form hierarchically in a sequence of cosmic structure formation where smaller groups of galaxies merge to form larger and richer systems ( geller & beers 1982 ; dressler & shectman 1988 ; girardi et al .",
    "1997 ; kriessler & beers 1997 ; jones & forman 1999 ; schuecker et al . 2001 ; burgett et al .",
    "the intra - group or intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of these clusters contains a hot ( t@xmath1k ) and tenuous ( n@xmath2 @xmath3 ) plasma which emits in x - rays mainly through bremsstrahlung and line emission ( kellogg et al .",
    "1972 ; mitchell et al .",
    "1979 ; also see reviews by sarazin 1988 ; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) .",
    "although many rich clusters show smooth x - ray surface - brightness distributions with a central peak , a large fraction ( at least , @xmath030% ( forman & jones 1990 ) or even up to @xmath040%-60% ( jones & forman 1992 , 1999 ; schuecker et al . 2001 ) ) shows double or multiple peaks in their x - ray surface brightness maps . as x - ray surface - brightness is more sensitive to density than temperature",
    "these observations effectively show peaks in the density distribution of the icm itself , which suggests the presence of subclusters or substructures which are possibly in the process of merging to form richer groups and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. nakamura et al .",
    "presence of large inhomogeneities in the x - ray temperature of the icm ( greater than a few kev ) on scales less than 0.5 mpc provides additional observational evidence of mergers ( roettiger et al .",
    "1996 ) . as dynamical evolution rapidly removes substructures , their existence proves that such clusters are dynamically young systems ( flin 2003 ) .    for studies of cosmology and the formation and evolution of large - scale structures , it is important to study the physical properties of clusters of galaxies containing sub - groups which are young and in the process of merging",
    ". mergers of subgroups can produce shocks , bulk gas flows and turbulence in the icm , and can disrupt cooling flows as has been seen in many clusters ( see fabian 1994 ; markevitch & vikhlinin 2007 ; owers et al .",
    "2011 ; maurogordato et al .",
    "mergers may also cause metal enrichment of the icm through enhanced ram - pressure stripping during mergers ( domainko et al .",
    "2005 ) , thereby affecting the evolution of the galaxies and the icm .",
    "subclustering information has also been used for estimating cosmological parameters such as the density parameter @xmath4 ( richstone et al .",
    "1992 ; kauffmann & white 1993 , angrick & bartelmann 2011 ) .    at radio wavelengths , besides the diffuse emission which may be in the form of halos and relics , the tailed radio sources associated with individual galaxies can provide further insights towards understanding these systems .",
    "for example , the wide angle tail ( wat ) galaxies are usually associated with the dominant galaxy in a group or a cluster , with the jets flaring into tails of emission which can extend to over a mpc in size ( e.g. roettiger et al .",
    "1996 ; douglass et al . 2008",
    "; mao et al . 2010 ) .",
    "their relatively high luminosity , close to the upper range of the fanaroff - riley i sources , and large sizes make these good tracers of galaxy clusters at moderate and high redshifts ( e.g. blanton et al .",
    "2003 ; douglass et al .",
    "2008 ) . since the dominant galaxies with which wats are associated are likely to have at most small peculiar velocities , their jets are unlikely to be bent by ram pressure caused by the motion of the galaxy ( burns 1981 ; eilek et al .",
    "1984 ; odonoghue et al . 1990 ) .",
    "cluster mergers where relative velocities between the systems can exceed @xmath01000 km s@xmath5 , causing significant bulk motion of the icm , have been invoked as the primary scenario for understanding the wat structures ( eilek et al .",
    "1984 ; burns et al .",
    "1994 ; roettiger et al . 1996 ) .",
    "x - ray observatories , particularly chandra and xmm - newton , have brought to light new information leading to a more detailed understanding and new insights into the physical processes occurring in galaxy clusters ( weratschnig 2010 ) .",
    "while chandra with its unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.5@xmath6 can study small - scale phenomena such as cold fronts , merger shocks and agn cavities , xmm - newton with its larger collecting area and sensitivity can study clusters to a much farther extent and can detect fainter x - ray signals . because of its large fov of @xmath7 and moderate resolution ( 6@xmath6 fwhm ) , xmm - newton can also study the nearby clusters very well .",
    "we have chosen a3395 for a detailed study of its merging environment since it is a well - known bimodal merging cluster ( henriksen & jones 1996 ; markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ; donnelly et al .",
    "2001 ; flin & krywult 2006 ) and it has been observed with xmm - newton , chandra and australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "a3395 has been observed previously in x - rays with the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) by henriksen & jones ( 1996 ) .",
    "they reported temperature of 2 to 4 kev for the cluster and calculated the cooling time for the cluster as @xmath19 gyr , which is much larger than the time predicted for the cluster to fully merge .",

    "we could not do the local background subtraction as the source fills almost the entire field of view of the detectors and it was impossible to find emission - free regions and therefore , using local background could have led to oversubtraction .",

    "a total of 258 point sources were thus detected .",
    "each of these detected sources was checked for each of the detectors and spurious sources ( sources that did not look like actual sources in the individual detector images ) were removed .",

    "we estimated the virial mass for each of the subclusters assuming that the galaxies included in each subcluster are bound and the velocity dispersions are isotropic .",

    "is that our area for including subcluster member galaxies in the ne region ( @xmath166mpc@xmath88 ) is @xmath025% larger than the area used by them ( @xmath167mpc@xmath88 ) , which leads to a larger velocity dispersion and harmonic mean distance between galaxy pairs .",
    "application of wavelet transform techniques to the positions of galaxies in a3395 by flin & krywult ( 2006 ) led to the detection of two subclusters which most probably correspond to the bimodal structure of the cluster at a scale of @xmath0527 kpc .",
    "it should be noted that if the w component is indeed a possible subcluster then its length scale is only @xmath0250 kpc . however , considering the velocity distribution of galaxies in the w region , the w component is most probably either a clump that has been stripped - off the sw subcluster by the ram pressure or a subcluster that has merged and relaxed into the sw subcluster ( also see  [ sec : disc_evid_fo_merg ] ) .      in this section",

    "thus , all three pairs of subclusters are most probably bound systems .      amongst the three regions ,",

    "the region a3395 w is connected to a3395 ne via a filamentary structure which is at an average temperature of @xmath174 kev .",
    "the 2-d thermodynamic maps show a high temperature of @xmath175 kev in a region between the ne and sw components along with a high entropy .",
    "as the surface brightness profiles of the ne and sw subclusters did not show any abrupt discontinuity , direct evidence for any shock heating could not be obtained .",
    "possibly , the high temperature is not due to shock heating but due to viscous dissipation , which has also been invoked as the possible reason for heating in the merging binary cluster a115 by gutierrez & krawczynski ( 2005 ) .",
    "the temperature map also shows high temperature regions in the w component .",
    "a part of the nw component just above the filament shows the highest temperature and entropy in the 2-d thermodynamic maps .",
    "also , from  [ sec : luminosity_estimates ] , we find indications of a possible heating of all the components of the cluster due to the ongoing mergers .",
    "taking into account the facts that non - detection of the shock front can also be due to projection effects and that some of the high temperature regions could also be fitted by purely non - thermal models , the possibility of x - ray emission in these regions being purely non - thermal from shock accelerated particles can not be ignored .",
    "two different merging scenarios for the cluster a3395 are possible .",
    "if the w region is indeed a separate subcluster , it is possible that the cluster is going through its first merger and sw and w subclusters are most probably falling and merging with the more massive and luminous ne subcluster .",
    "however , under this assumption , the origin of the filament joining the w to the ne subcluster can not be explained .",
    "another possibility is that the two main subclusters ne and sw have already gone through their first merger and the filament and the w region are likely results of two different phases of ram - pressure stripping from the sw subcluster .",
    "the observed strong gradient in the surface - brightness profile of the sw subcluster along the southeast direction is possibly due to an orbital motion of the sw subcluster around the ne subcluster . under this assumption ,",
    "the outer hot and diffuse layers of the sw subcluster were perhaps stripped off by the cooler and denser gas of the ne subcluster during the first phase of ram - pressure stripping , resulting in the formation of the filament and the w region was stripped off in a later ( more recent ) phase of ram - pressure stripping where a relatively colder clump of the sw subcluster was stripped off the main subcluster by the hotter surrounding gas .",

    "2008 ) have analyzed a similar merging scenario of the m86 galaxy with the icm of the virgo cluster in which a hotter tail and a colder plume were formed in two different phases of ram - pressure stripping .",
    "+ clusters hosting a wat with bent lobes are known to be the sites of ongoing mergers .",
    "thus , the bent lobes of the wat source in a3395 sw are consistent with its being a merging cluster .",
    "the wat sources in merging clusters have been known to show some additional interesting characteristics , viz . , the offset of the x - ray centroid from the position of the bright central galaxy hosting the wat ( sakelliou & merrifield , 2000 ) . in a3395",
    "sw , we have found an offset of about @xmath176 kpc ( @xmath016.5@xmath6 ) between the wat hosting bcg and the x - ray centroid .",
    "merging clusters hosting a wat also show an elongation of the icm distribution along the line that bisects the wat ( gmez et al .",
