    "we provide a derivation of the hamiltonian ( 7 ) that describes the dynamics at timescales larger than @xmath145 .",
    "the schrdinger picture hamiltonian of our setup reads @xmath146 in changing to the interaction - picture with respect to @xmath147 , we have to account for the mechanical nonlinearity and thus employ the decomposition of @xmath148 in energy eigenstates @xmath149 in a regime where @xmath150 , the effective hamiltonian is given by @xcite , @xmath151 for a large detuning @xmath14 , the optomechanical interaction can not efficiently populate the cavity .",
    "we thus assume an empty cavity mode and drop fast rotating terms @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which leads to @xmath154 where indices @xmath155 and @xmath16 label the resonators ( qubits ) and indices @xmath156 and @xmath157 label internal resonator levels .",

    "this separates @xmath144 into two noninteracting parts @xmath159 and @xmath106 , acting separately on gate and saved qubits . since @xmath160 for any qubits @xmath161 and for @xmath162 , we can furthermore separate the terms in @xmath144 that act the qubit subspace from the remainder . denoting @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 for @xmath166 as well as @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 for @xmath170",

    "therefore , the strength of optomechanical coupling is proportional to the polarizability @xmath173 of the nanotube . here , we make use of the fact , that at the scale of @xmath174 optical wavelength , the polarizability can be significantly enhanced due to the presence of excitonic resonances @xcite . near an excitonic resonance of frequency @xmath175 and linewidth @xmath176 ,",

    "<S> our approach is realizable with current or near future experimental technology . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the nanomechanical resonators in our approach show very promising scalability properties and are not vulnerable to fluctuations of background charges such as superconducting qubits . the performance of our scheme could be improved further with optimized laser and radio frequency control pulses . </S>",
    "<S> alternative platforms for an implementation could consist of stiff nanobeams with high optomechanical couplings such as photonic crystal nanobeam cavities in diamond @xcite . for building even larger scale devices our scheme could also be integrated into optomechanical networks of multiple cavities @xcite .    </S>",
