    "<S> we calculate the branching ratio and direct cp asymmetry in nonleptonic two body @xmath0 decays @xmath1 . it is shown that the tree diagram and gluon fusion mechanism via penguin diagram have comparable contributions to these decays which , as a result , could provide an interesting venue for investigating cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> our estimate shows that the direct cp asymmetry in the above decays could be as large as @xmath2 which along with a branching ratio @xmath3 should be accessible to experiment in the near future .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery by the cleo collaboration of a larger than expected branching ratio for fast @xmath4 production in hadronic @xmath0 decays@xcite has led to extensive theoretical work on investigating the underlying mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> one explanation which is based on the gluon - gluon-@xmath4 anomalous coupling , has been proposed by atwood and soni@xcite . in this mechanism , @xmath4 is produced by the fragmentation of the virtual gluon of the qcd @xmath5 penguin . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in order to formulate the inclusive @xmath6 and exclusive @xmath7 decays under the same mechanism , we proposed a nonspectator gluon fusion process using anomaly driven @xmath8 vertex@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exclusive branching ratio @xmath9 obtained this way is in good agreement with experimantal data .    in this paper , we focus on a different hadronic decay mode of @xmath0 mesons which may receive a significant contribution from the above mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if the anomalous @xmath8 vertex in conjunction with the qcd penguin is the underlying process for the fast @xmath4 production in @xmath0 meson decays , one could expect that the same mechanism also be an important part of the two body @xmath1 decay modes . the difference between these decay modes and @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> decay is in that , unlike the latter one , the former decays receive a comparable contribution from the tree diagrams . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , one could expect that the above decay modes provide a suitable avenue to investigate the direct cp asymmetry in charged @xmath0 meson decays . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the branching ratio and direct cp asymmetry in @xmath1 decays and point out a possible large cp asymmetry which should be accessible to experiment in the near future .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by repeating the derivation of the nonspectator contribution to @xmath7 matrix element from reference @xcite . using the dominant chromo - electric component of the qcd penguin , we obtain the following effective hamiltonian corresponding to figure 1 . </S>",

    "<S> , we can express the matrix element for @xmath7 decay as the following : @xmath23 leading to the exclusive decay rate @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the three momentum of the k meson @xmath27}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] and the energy transfer by the gluon emitted from the light quark in the b meson rest frame , respectively . inserting @xmath28 gev@xmath29 , @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 gev in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) results in the following exclusive branching ratio : @xmath32 which is in good agreement with the experimental data@xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that if @xmath8 anomalous coupling along with qcd @xmath5 penguin ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) is indeed the dominant underlying mechanism for @xmath33 decay , then one could expect that a similar process , with @xmath34 quark replacing the strange quark , to contribute significantly to @xmath35 decay mode . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case , unlike @xmath7 decay , the tree and penguin amplitudes receive a ckm suppression factor of the same order and therefore there is a good possibility for existence of a large direct cp asymmetry in @xmath1 decay modes . the nonspectator contribution to @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained from eq . </S>",

    "<S> the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 are correlated and their range have been determined from ckm unitarity fits@xcite . in order to show the dependence of the branching ratio and cp asymmetry on these parameters , we present our results for central values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and three different sets of @xmath62 values from the constrained range .    we note that different weak ( cp odd ) phases enter nonspectator ( penguin ) and tree amplitudes . also , an overall strong ( cp even ) phase @xmath63 for the nonspectator amplitude </S>",
    "<S> is assumed which in combination with the weak phases leads to cp asymmerty in @xmath1 decays . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one possible source of this strong phase could be the form factor which parametrizes the @xmath8 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the sigma model formulation of @xmath64 where this form factor is derived from a quark triangle loop ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> inserting @xmath71 ( @xmath72gev@xmath20 as mentioned before ) in eq . ( 11 ) and using the same input values for various parameters as in @xmath7 case , we obtain the following branching ratio for @xmath42 @xmath73\\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) is due to current - current operators ( tree ) while the second term is the contribution of the nonspectator gluon fusion process ( penguin ) and the last entry is the cross term . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio for the cp conjugate process @xmath74 is obtained from the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) by changing the sign of the weak angles @xmath75 and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the cp asymmetry which is defined as @xmath77 is proportional to @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in figure 4 </S>",
    "<S> , we illustrate the variation of @xmath80 and @xmath81 when @xmath63 takes on values in the range @xmath82 for three different sets of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite interesting that a large asymmetry is possible due to the comparable nonspectator and tree contributions to this process . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( i.e. @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 could be as large as @xmath2 and @xmath3 if @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> a larger branching ratio @xmath88 is possible for @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( i.e. @xmath91 ) however , the asymmetry is somewhat smaller around @xmath92 . on the other hand , for the preferred values @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( i.e. @xmath95 ) , the resulting branching ratio and asymmetry are @xmath96 for @xmath97 , which is the case if we assume that the absorptive part of the gluon - gluon-@xmath4 form factor @xmath16 is responsible for the strong phase .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we emphasize that a comparison between our results and other theoretical estimates@xcite indicates that @xmath98 and @xmath81 could receive a significant enhancement due to the inclusion of the nonspectator gluon fusion mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> these decay modes could be accessible to experiment in the near future and therefore , provide a clean testing ground for cp violation mechanism in the standard model . </S>"
