    "in the present paper we discuss reducibility and reduction for ordinary differential equations .",
    "our focus of interest is on ( explicit ) reducibility imparted by some map to a lower - dimensional system ( possibly defined on a submanifold of @xmath0-space ) . for equations of higher order , reduction is frequently understood as reduction of order , which will also be considered .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to consider various notions of reducibility , establish a general framework , and elucidate the relations between symmetry , generalizations such as @xmath1-symmetry , and reducibility .",
    "we clarify and extend notions , generalize results , and obtain new applications . in a related paper @xcite we present a more thorough discussion of higher order equations , including prolongation formulas .    for autonomous first order differential equations ( resp .",
    "the associated vector fields ) there are well - defined and well - established notions of symmetry ( sending parameterized solutions to parameterized solutions ) and orbital symmetry ( sending solution orbits to solution orbits , and consequently invariant sets to invariant sets ) . a canonical notion of reducibility ( which includes symmetry reduction ) was introduced and discussed in @xcite , and we extend this by introducing the notion of orbital reducibility .",
    "the latter turns out to correspond to a generalization of @xmath1-symmetries ( muriel and romero ; in particular @xcite ) . due to a relation between ( orbital ) reducibility and ( orbital ) symmetry",
    "there is a canonical construction of ( orbitally ) reducible systems from ( orbitally ) symmetric ones , and in some cases it can be shown that all ( orbitally ) reducible systems are obtained in this manner . for vector fields the notions of `` reducibility via some map '' discussed in this paper seem to be comprehensive",
    "moreover , all notions of reducibility for non - autonomous systems or for equations of higher order can be traced back to the case of first order autonomous systems , just as non - autonomous systems or systems of higher order can be written as first - order autonomous systems .",
    "reducibility for a non - autonomous first - order system ( via a map sending solutions to solutions of some lower dimensional system ) amounts to orbital reducibility of an associated autonomous system .",
    "this general framework for reduction comprises the main focus of the paper .",
    "reducibility of a higher - order equation ( in the sense of reducing order ) is equivalent to reducibility of the canonically associated first - order system ( in the sense of reducing dimension ) . in the course of proving this , we note that every ( non - autonomous ) @xmath2-dimensional system of order one with nontrivial right - hand side may be rewritten as a single equation of order @xmath3 , reverting the usual procedure .",
    "the problem to explicitly determine a reducing ( or orbitally reducing ) map for a given autonomous equation of first order seems to be just as hard ( and as algorithmically inaccessible ) as the problem of finding a symmetry ( or orbital symmetry ) .",
    "this is essentially due to the straightening theorem and the implicit function theorem , which are not , or not completely , constructive .",
    "but the inverse problem to determine all vector fields reducible by a given map is easier to access in some relevant cases .",
    "in particular we transfer the approach from olver and rosenau @xcite to the ordinary differential equation setting , and determine all differential equations which admit reduction by invariants of a given compact and connected group .",
    "moreover we construct reducible higher - order equations from equations admitting symmetries , in particular lie point symmetries . in this way",
    "we extend the class of reducible equations obtained from lambda - symmetric systems , and provide a different perspective for the latter .    throughout this paper",
    "we restrict attention to analytic functions and vector fields ; many of the results can , with some care , be extended to the smooth case . in order to give a self - contained discussion , and to make the paper accessible to readers with different backgrounds , we include a review ( and sometimes rephrasing ) of some facts and methods .",
    "we first fix some notation .",
    "let an ( analytic ) autonomous ordinary differential equation @xmath4 be given on the open and connected subset @xmath5 of @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 standing for @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the corresponding lie derivative which acts on analytic functions via @xmath11 and recall that @xmath12 is called a first integral of if @xmath13 .",
    "we distinguish between solutions ( including parameterization ) and solution orbits ( trajectories ) .",
    "if one is primarily interested in orbits , then it is appropriate to consider an equivalence class of differential equations , rather than the single equation in case @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the zero set of @xmath16 . then",
    "a differential equation defined on the open set @xmath17 has the same solution orbits on @xmath18 if and only if it has the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 analytic and without zeros .",
    "( the non - obvious direction holds because a suitable reparameterization of a solution of will produce a solution of @xmath21 . )",
    "thus one has the notion of local orbital equivalence for vector fields that are defined on some open and dense subset of @xmath5 .",
    "[ orbfi ] _ two equations are locally orbit - equivalent if and only if they admit the same first integrals near any non - stationary point",
    ". stated in a different way , two equations are locally orbit - equivalent if and only if they admit the same local invariant sets near any non - stationary point._@xmath22    [ autonon ] _ for a non - autonomous equation @xmath23 one may define the",

    "thus non - autonomous equations in dimension @xmath0 and ( local ) orbital equivalence classes of autonomous equations in dimension @xmath29 stand in correspondence._@xmath22      a symmetry of the autonomous differential equation is a ( locally invertible ) map sending parameterized solutions to parameterized solutions .",
    "an orbital symmetry of is a ( locally invertible ) transformation mapping solution orbits to solution orbits , hence sending to an orbit - equivalent equation @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath23 the usual definition of a symmetry is that of a locally invertible map defined on some open subset of @xmath34 ( thus transforming both @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) such that solutions are mapped to solutions , see e.g. olver @xcite .",
    "equivalently , by the above proposition and remarks [ orbfi ] and [ autonon ] , such a map is an orbital symmetry for any autonomized system .",
    "thus , necessary and sufficient conditions defining an infinitesimal symmetry of a non - autonomous first - order equation are known .",
    "the intent underlying any notion of `` reducibility by some map '' for equation is rather obvious , as noted in the introduction .",
    "but details have to be specified .",
    "the following particular form was introduced in @xcite .",
    "[ redudef ] we call the equation if there exist a number @xmath2 , @xmath37 , a positive integer @xmath38 , an analytic map @xmath39 , and a differential equation @xmath40 defined on an open neighborhood @xmath41 of @xmath42 such that @xmath43 maps parameterized solutions of @xmath31 to parameterized solutions of @xmath44 , and the derivative @xmath45 has rank @xmath46 on @xmath5 , with rank @xmath47 at some point",
    ".    the solution - preserving property is equivalent to the identity @xmath48 moreover , due to our assumptions the derivative @xmath45 has maximal rank @xmath2 on an open - dense subset of @xmath5 .",
    "this definition of reducibility is designed to include interesting cases , like reduction by group invariants , which do not a priori provide a map to a vector space of smaller dimension .",
    "but locally near any maximal rank point , one has reduction to @xmath49 , and the structure of reducible vector fields is quite simple . in this sense , the problem can be locally  trivialized  .",

    "moreover , up to this coordinate transformation one has @xmath56 where the asterisks symbolize functions of all variables @xmath57 .",
    "we may assume by the implicit function theorem and the rank condition that @xmath54 . since the matrix @xmath58 has rank @xmath2 , the functions @xmath59 depend on @xmath60 only .",
    "then by the reducing property @xmath61 can depend on @xmath60 only , and all assertions follow .    _",
    "( a ) this result can be refined . according e.g. to @xcite , prop .",
    "3.4 every set @xmath62 is invariant for @xmath63 and locally a submanifold of @xmath5 .",
    "restriction to such sets thus suggests , and in principle allows , a case - by - case approach to reduction .",
    "+ ( b ) the problem of reducibility can be `` trivialized '' in yet another way : by the straightening theorem , @xmath16 may be transformed to a constant vector field near any non - stationary point , for which reducibility ( to any dimension @xmath64 ) is obvious .",
    "this observation shows that the set @xmath5 in definition [ redudef ] may play an important role .",
    "furthermore , explicit determination of a reducing map for a given equation ( or explicit determination of all vector fields reducible by a given map ) is a different matter , and reducibility is a nontrivial property near stationary points ( see also @xcite).@xmath22 _    the above trivialization results are of little practical relevance , due to their reliance on non - constructive theorems .",
    "their principal value lies in providing insight into the local structure of reducing maps and reducible vector fields .",
    "we next rephrase and generalize some results of @xcite , section 2 , about the correspondence between reducing maps and involution systems .",
