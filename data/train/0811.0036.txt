    "we recently discovered  @xcite that a result of mader  @xcite leads to a proof of a conjecture of sachs : a graph on @xmath4 vertices with at least @xmath5 edges is intrinsically knotted . in the current paper , we will give evidence in support of a similar bound @xmath6 that ensures knotting of bipartite graphs .",
    "recall that a graph is intrinsically knotted ( ik ) if every tame embedding of the graph in @xmath7 contains a non - trivially knotted cycle .",
    "since knotless embedding is preserved under edge contraction  @xcite , work of robertson and seymour  @xcite shows that this property is determined by a finite list of minor minimal ik graphs .",
    "however , determining this list remains difficult .",
    "it is known  @xcite that @xmath8 and @xmath9 along with any graph obtained from these two by triangle - y exchanges is minor minimal with respect to intrinsic knotting .",
    "foisy  @xcite has shown the existence of several additional minor minimal ik graphs .    as",
    "a complete characterization of ik graphs remains out of reach for the moment , we propose instead a sufficient condition for intrinsic knotting that is easy to test . for a graph @xmath10 ,",

    "if @xmath14 then @xmath10 is intrinsically knotted .    note that if a bipartite graph has four or fewer vertices in one part , then it is not ik  @xcite .",
    "also , any graph can be made bipartite without affecting its topology by adding degree two vertices in the middle of selected edges .",
    "so , even for graphs that are not bipartite , the proposed bound may be more useful in some instances than the bound @xmath15 that applies to all graphs of seven or more vertices .",
    "the conjecture was proved for graphs with exactly five vertices in one part by  @xcite .",
    "we build on their work to show    [ thm56]let @xmath10 be a bipartite graph with exactly five or exactly six vertices in one part and at least five vertices in the other . if @xmath14 then @xmath10 is ik .",
