    "since the 1950 s , elastic electron scattering has been utilized to obtain accurate information on the size and shape of nuclei @xcite .",
    "because electrons and nucleons interact essentially through the electromagnetic force , the nucleus remains rather unperturbed during the scattering process and the analysis of the data is not hampered by uncertainties associated with the strong interaction .",
    "thus , electron scattering is able to provide very clean information about the charge distribution of atomic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "low - energy nuclear physics is nowadays moving very fast towards the domain of exotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is due to the development of successive generations of radioactive - isotope beam ( rib ) facilities @xcite , such as fair and spiral2 in europe , frib in north america , and hirfl - csr , rarf or ribf in asia , which will allow studying the properties of nuclei beyond the stability valley .",
    "many interesting effects have already been discovered in exotic nuclei , such as neutron and proton halos , neutron skins , and new magic numbers .",
    "these effects may be related to the structure of the nucleon distributions far from stability . as with stable nuclei ,",
    "one way of exploring the structure of exotic nuclei is through the electromagnetic interaction . for this purpose ,",
    "a new generation of electron - rib colliders using storage rings is under construction by riken ( japan ) @xcite and at gsi ( germany ) @xcite .",
    "it is expected that in the near future the scrit project in japan @xcite and the elise experiment at fair in germany @xcite will offer the opportunity of studying the structure of unstable exotic nuclei by means of electron scattering .    on the theoretical side",
    ", much work has been devoted to the study of charge distributions of exotic nuclei through calculations of both electron scattering ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) and proton scattering ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "suda @xcite pointed out that in electron scattering off unstable nuclei the maxima and the minima of the charge form factor are very sensitive to the size and the diffuseness of the charge density .",
    "this fact has been confirmed by different works that have analyzed the behavior of the charge form factor along isotopic @xcite and isotonic @xcite chains .    to probe the charge distribution in nuclei",
    ", the electron beam energy needs to be of the order of a few hundred mev .",
    "as one deals with relativistic electrons , it is mandatory to solve the elastic scattering problem of dirac particles in the potential generated by the nuclear charge density .",
    "the simplest approach is the plane - wave born approximation ( pwba ) where the initial and final states of the electron are described by dirac plane waves .",
    "the pwba accounts for many features of electron scattering but it can not provide an accurate description of the electric charge form factor , in particular near the dips .",
    "the most elaborated calculations of electron - nucleus scattering are obtained by the exact phase - shift analysis of the dirac equation .",
    "this calculation scheme is known as distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite .",
    "the dwba has been used to analyze different aspects of the scattering of electrons by nuclei , see e.g.  refs.@xcite and references therein . in the present work",
    "we employ the dwba to study elastic electron scattering in isotones .",
    "it may be mentioned that the eikonal approximation has been applied in some studies of elastic electron scattering off proton - rich and neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "the charge density of the target nucleus is one of the basic ingredients of the electron - nucleus scattering problem . for medium and heavy nuclei ,",
    "the theoretical charge densities can be calculated in the mean - field approximation using non - relativistic nuclear forces or relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models .",
    "it is known that the overall trends of the elastic scattering of electrons by stable medium and heavy nuclei , are well reproduced by the mean - field charge densities computed with nuclear models that have been calibrated to describe the ground - state properties ( in particular the charge radii ) of some selected nuclei . however , different nuclear models differ in the fine details and describe with different quality the experimental scattering data .",

    "@xcite we studied elastic electron scattering along the ca and sn isotopic chains in dwba . in that work we reported several correlations among scattering observables and some properties of the nuclear charge density along the isotopic chains @xcite",
    "in the present work , we investigate what information on nuclear structure can be gained from the study of elastic electron scattering in the @xmath0 , 50 , and 14 isotonic chains .",
    "we aim at extracting general trends , according to current mean - field theories , about the behavior of some observables that may be measured in experiments performed with unstable nuclei in the low - momentum transfer region .",
    "our choice of the @xmath0 , 50 , and 14 isotonic chains among other possible @xmath3 values , is mainly motivated by the fact that they cover different regions of the mass table and by the following reasons .",
    "on the one hand , there is a certain interest in the structure of unstable nuclei belonging to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 shell closures because some of these nuclei may correspond to waiting points in the astrophysical @xmath4-processes of nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 isotones below @xmath5sn are believed to be in close relation with the peak of the solar @xmath4-process abundance distribution observed around the mass number @xmath6 @xcite , whereas the @xmath1 isotones near @xmath7ni are thought to be responsible for producing the pronounced abundance peak observed around @xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "scattering data for light nuclei , such as e.g.those of @xmath2 , are likely to be obtained in future electron scattering facilities such as scrit @xcite and elise @xcite .",
    "the study of elastic electron scattering along isotopic and isotonic chains explores different aspects of the nuclear charge density .",
    "the electric charge form factor along an isotopic chain gives information about the effect of the different number of neutrons on the charge density , which becomes more and more dilute and extends to larger distances as the neutron number increases @xcite . in an isotonic chain",
    ", the changes in the charge form factor primarily inform about the effect of the outer proton single - particle orbitals that are being filled as the atomic number increases in the chain .",
    "thus , our previous @xcite and present study together provide a survey of the evolution of the charge form factor with the neutron and proton numbers in different mass regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we summarize the method employed in our study of electron scattering in isotonic chains . as the basic methodology follows that of ref .",
    "@xcite , we address the reader to that work and references therein for more details about the relativistic nuclear mean - field theory and about the dirac partial - wave analysis , which we perform using the elsepa code @xcite adapted to the nuclear problem . we devote section iii to the presentation and analysis of our numerical results for elastic electron - nucleus scattering in the @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 chains . finally , our conclusions are laid in section iv .",
    "to investigate electron scattering in isotonic chains we follow the method developed in ref .  @xcite . for completeness , we summarize here the main aspects of this method .",
    "the electron beam energy in our investigation is fixed at 500 mev , which is a typical energy in electron - nucleus scattering experiments . indeed , rather than discussing directly the differential cross section ( dcs ) , we study the dwba electric charge form factor because it is almost independent of the electron beam energy in the low - momentum transfer regime , as it can be seen from fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite and from fig .",
    "[ dcs - ff82].b below .",
    "we compute the electric charge form factor as follows @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dcs of the extended nucleus and of the point nucleus , respectively , calculated in dwba .",
    "we denote the form factor ( [ fdwba ] ) by @xmath14 hereinafter .",
    "it is to be mentioned that here we are using the dwba point - nucleus dcs rather than the usual mott cross section @xcite : @xmath15 in order to extract the effect of the finite size of the nucleus it seems reasonable to consider the two cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ fdwba ] ) calculated within the same approximation .",
    "the point - nucleus dcs calculated within the dwba was also used in analyses of the form factor of elastic electron scattering data ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and discussions in ref .",
    "we make a comparison of the results of the two approaches in section iii below .",
    "it is found that the choice is not critical for our study in the low - momentum transfer regime .",
    "we calculate the charge densities with the relativistic mean - field parametrization g2 @xcite , which we also employed in ref .",
    "this nuclear model was constructed as an effective hadronic lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the nucleon density distributions are obtained self - consistently at the mean - field level by numerical solution of the corresponding variational equations .",
    "in contrast to most of the nuclear mean - field models that assume point densities , the g2 lagrangian incorporates the low - energy electromagnetic structure of the nucleon through vector - meson dominance @xcite .",
    "this implies that the charge density is obtained directly from the self - consistent solution of the mean - field equations without any extra folding with external single - nucleon form factors .",
    "we have verified that the charge density distribution provided by g2 agrees very well with the charge density that can be obtained from the point proton and point neutron density distributions of g2 folded with experimental single - nucleon charge form factors .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the g2 relativistic mean - field interaction is a reliable parameter set both for calculations of ground - state properties of nuclei and for predictions of the nuclear equation of state up to supra - normal densities , as well as for predictions of some properties of neutron stars .",
    "first calculations of the charge form factor in pwba with g2 were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our calculations",
    "we assume spherical symmetry although some of the nuclei considered in this study may be deformed , particularly in the case of the @xmath2 isotones @xcite .",
    "pairing correlations are important for describing open - shell nuclei .",
    "we take pairing into account through a modified bcs approach that simulates the continuum ( needed for nuclei at the drip lines ) through quasi - bound levels which are retained by their centrifugal barrier ( neutron levels ) or by their centrifugal - plus - coulomb barrier ( proton levels ) @xcite .",
    "the pairing interaction in this approach is described by means of a constant matrix element fitted to reproduce the experimental binding energies of some selected isotopic and isotonic chains as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is to be mentioned that a mean - field treatment is not expected to be sufficient for light exotic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 isotonic chain studied below ( with nuclei from @xmath16o to @xmath17ca ) corresponds to a somewhat limiting case , and the mean - field results should be taken as semiquantitative .",
    "the calculations with the g2 model predict a relatively magic character of the neutron numbers @xmath2 and @xmath18 .",
    "these neutron numbers have attracted some attention in recent theoretical and experimental studies as possible new magic numbers in exotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the use of modeled charge densities and electric charge form factors in the experimental analysis of scattering data has been extensive in the past , and continues to date .",
    "this is because in many cases the parameters of the modeled charge densities are directly related with the size of the bulk and surface regions of the nucleus under study . in this way ,",
    "the modeled densities help to provide a clear physical interpretation of the electron scattering data .",
    "this is the case of the so - called helm model @xcite that we used for some calculations in our previous study of isotopic chains @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the helm model are fitted to the electric charge form factor in the low - momentum transfer regime . here",
    ", the calculations with the helm model will be helpful to gain some insight about the variation of the position and width of the surface of the charge density distribution along the isotonic chains .",
    "we briefly summarize the fitting procedure of the parameters of the helm model in the next subsection .",
    "the original version of the helm model @xcite has been extended in various ways for a more accurate description of the experimental charge densities @xcite . in the simplest version of the model @xcite",
    ", the charge density is obtained from the convolution of a constant density @xmath19 in a hard sphere of radius @xmath20 with a gaussian distribution having variance @xmath21 . by construction",
    ", @xmath20 gives the effective location of the position of the nuclear surface , and hence characterizes the size of the density profile , whereas the parameter @xmath22 is a measure of the thickness of the surface region of the density distribution .",
    "the helm charge density is then given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 the two parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , of the helm model determine the charge density as well as the electric charge form factor within the pwba : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spherical bessel function .",
    "note that we use natural units throughout the present paper .",
    "we proceed as suggested originally in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the helm parameters associated to a given nucleus from the pwba electric charge form factor of that nucleus .",
    "first , we require that the first zero of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) coincides with the first zero of the mean - field pwba charge form factor ( fourier transform of the charge density obtained with the g2 model ) .",
    "we will refer to this charge form factor as @xmath27 hereinafter .",
    "therefore , the radius of the equivalent helm density reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the first zero of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the momentum transfer corresponding to the first zero of @xmath27 .",
    "second , we determine the variance @xmath21 of the gaussian distribution such that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the momentum transfer corresponding to the second maximum of @xmath34 ( the first maximum appears always at @xmath35 @xmath36 ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) , one easily obtains @xmath37",
    "we start with the discussion of the results for the @xmath0 isotonic chain where the different aspects of our study are described in detail .",
    "after that , we extend our study to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 isotonic chains .      we first analyze the charge densities along the @xmath0 chain . the ordering and the energy of the different proton single - particle levels , mainly the levels closest to the fermi level , are quite important for the present study . this is because the corresponding single - particle wave functions determine , to a large extent , the shape of the charge density at the surface region as well as the electric charge form factor in the low - momentum transfer region .",
    "[ spln82 ] displays the energy of the proton single - particle levels of some selected nuclei of the @xmath0 isotopic chain .",

    "the 1@xmath49 level shows energy gaps of about 2 and 4 mev with respect to the @xmath45 and @xmath44 levels , respectively , and a gap of about 9 mev with respect to the deeper 1@xmath50 level .",
    "this large energy gap is due to the magicity of the proton number @xmath51 . with increasing mass number these relevant levels",
    "are shifted up in energy , roughly as a whole , retaining the same ordering and approximately the same energy gaps . as a consequence of this level scheme , in going from the nucleus @xmath39zr to @xmath40ce the charge densities differ basically by the effects of filling up the @xmath43 and @xmath44 shells , and in going from @xmath40ce to @xmath41gd the charge densities differ by the occupancy the @xmath45 shell . in these proton - rich isotones with mass number above @xmath52 , the pairing correlations play a non - negligible role and therefore the charge densities also get contributions from the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 orbitals .",

    "second , in the case of the sn isotopes ( see fig .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath21 displays local minima for @xmath5sn and @xmath56sn , pointing out the magicity of the @xmath0 and @xmath57 neutron numbers which makes the charge densities of these isotopes more compact .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath0 isotonic chain , the kinks shown by @xmath21 are rather related with the filling of the different proton single - particle orbitals belonging to the major shell between @xmath51 and @xmath58 . in particular , when the @xmath43 and @xmath44 shells are being filled , i.e. , between @xmath39zr and @xmath40ce , @xmath21 decreases almost linearly .",
    "the local minimum of @xmath21 for @xmath40ce points to some magic character of this nucleus .",
    "the fact that the @xmath22 parameter takes the smaller values in the region around @xmath40ce , indicates that the surface of the equivalent charge density is more abrupt at and around this nucleus .",
    "when the @xmath45 level starts to be appreciably occupied , @xmath21 increases again nearly linearly till @xmath41gd , where a new kink appears . from @xmath41gd to the proton drip line ( @xmath42hf ) , the value of @xmath21 continues to increase , but now with a smaller slope as a consequence of the higher occupancy of the @xmath46 , @xmath59 , and @xmath48 levels .",
