    "understanding matter under extremely intense magnetic fields is one of the most interesting topics in modern physics due to its relevance for studies involving compact objects like magnetars @xcite , measurements in heavy ion collisions at very high energies @xcite or the first phases of the universe @xcite .",
    "the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a long - standing theoretical issue since the discovery of the asymptotic freedom of qcd .",
    "the structure of the qcd phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field has been the subject of several studies @xcite , in particular , at zero chemical potential @xmath0 ( the @xmath1 plane ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .    at zero chemical potential , almost all low - energy effective models , including the njl - type models , as well as some lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations @xcite , found an enhancement of the condensate due to the magnetic field ( magnetic catalysis ) independently of the temperature .",
    "however , a recent lqcd study @xcite , for @xmath2 flavors with physical quarks and pion masses , shows a different behavior in the transition temperature region , in particular , the suppression of the light condensates by the magnetic field , an effect known as inverse magnetic catalysis @xcite .",
    "the reaction of the gluon sector to the presence of an external magnetic field should be incorporated into effective models in order to describe the inverse magnetic catalysis @xcite .",
    "one way to take it into account is to choose a magnetic field dependent @xmath3 of the polyakov potential @xcite .",
    "the polyakov - loop extended nambu  jona - lasinio model ( pnjl ) @xcite has been generalized to include an effective four - quark vertex interaction depending on the polyakov loop , the entanglement interaction @xcite . this extension is known as the entanglement extended pnjl model ( epnjl ) . the entanglement interaction generates the correlation between the chiral restoration and deconfinement transition needed to be consistent with lqcd results at imaginary isospin quark - number chemical potential and real and imaginary chemical potentials .",
    "an equation of state was constructed and the phase diagram in su(2 ) were studied in @xcite using the epnjl model .",
    "the theta - vacuum effects on the qcd phase diagram was studied in @xcite using the su(3 ) epnjl model .",
    "the three - flavor phase diagram for zero and imaginary quark - number chemical potential using epnjl was performed in @xcite with the entanglement interaction being parametrized in order to reproduce qualitatively the su(3 ) lqcd results at zero and imaginary chemical potentials @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the phase diagram of qcd in an external magnetic field was studied using the su(2 ) epnjl model with and without 8-quark interaction @xcite .",
    "our aim is to extend the study of the @xmath1 plane using the ( @xmath4)-flavor ( e)pnjl models including the t hooft determinant that reproduces @xmath5 anomaly , responsible for the mechanism of flavor mixing .",
    "in particular , we want to determine how the entanglement interaction is affected by the magnetic field and its consequences in the model predictions .",
    "the effect of external magnetic fields on deconfinement and chiral pseudocritical temperatures has been discussed in @xcite using both the su(2 ) pnjl and epnjl models . as in almost all other low - energy qcd models",
    ", these two models predict that the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration increases with the increase of an external magnetic field strength .",
    "it was also shown that within the epnjl the splitting between the chiral and deconfinement transition temperatures is smaller than the splitting predicted by the pnjl model @xcite , and at @xmath6 it is not larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the phase diagram of 2 + 1 flavor pnjl model with charge asymmetry under an external magnetic field was also investigated in @xcite , while the effects of an external magnetic field on the fluctuations of quark number , fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges was studied in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath152 parametrization has the lowest @xmath196 peak at @xmath114 , but the highest at @xmath193 , showing that the parametrization keep the @xmath146 gap close to zero at any magnetic field strength ( see middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , and with increasing @xmath151 the first - order phase transitions become closer . at last , for the @xmath127 parametrization , the maximum value of @xmath196 increases slightly with @xmath151 . looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we see that at @xmath193 we have @xmath203 ; that is , we are in the crossover region for magnetic fields up to @xmath161 .",
    "in this work we have studied the three - flavor quark matter under the influence of an external magnetic field using the epnjl model .",
    "the pseudocritical temperatures have been calculated as a function of the magnetic field strength and the range of possible parametrizations of the entanglement interaction analyzed .",
    "the main result obtained is the conclusion that the coincidence or not of the deconfinement and chiral pseudocritical temperatures , also including the effect of the magnetic field , depends on the parametrization chosen .",
    "the pnjl model predicts different critical temperatures for both phase transitions and their difference increases as the magnetic field strength grows . within the pnjl model ,",
    "the temperature of the deconfinement transition is almost insensitive to the magnetic field when compared with the chiral transition temperature .    in a lqcd study @xcite",
    ", it was found that the transition temperature increases slightly with the magnetic field ( this study shows no inverse magnetic catalysis ) and no evidence for a disentanglement of both phase transitions was found , at least for magnetic fields up to @xmath204 gev@xmath158 . it was also observed that the transition becomes a sharper crossover and a first - order phase transition might appear . therefore , as pointed out in @xcite , the parametrization of the entanglement interaction can be used to reproduce this behavior . however , in order to reproduce the inverse magnetic catalysis , as some recent lqcd results @xcite show , the model must be modified once the entanglement interactions between the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate are not able to describe the inverse magnetic catalysis . a way to modify the model",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where a magnetic field dependent @xmath3 allows us to mimic the reaction of the gluon sector to the presence of an external magnetic field in order to reproduce the correct behavior of transition temperatures given by lattice qcd .",
    "nevertheless , this same mechanism also can give rise to a first - order phase transition at quite low magnetic fields .",
    "finally , as expected , the entanglement interaction also affects the thermodynamic properties .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the dependence on temperature of the heat capacity and sound velocity are sensitive to the entanglement interaction .",
    "both quantities reflect the smaller or larger coincidence between chiral and deconfinement transitions , and the proximity of a first - order phase transition .    :",
