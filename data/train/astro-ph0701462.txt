    "3d null points are thought to be present in abundance in the solar corona .",
    "a myriad of magnetic flux concentrations penetrate the solar surface , and it is predicted that for every 100 photospheric flux concentrations , there should be present between approximately 7 and 15 coronal null points @xcite . furthermore , there is observational evidence that reconnection involving a 3d null point may be at work in some solar flares @xcite and solar eruptions @xcite . closer to home , there has been a recent in situ observation @xcite by the cluster spacecraft of a 3d magnetic null , which is proposed to play an important role in the observed signatures of reconnection within the earth s magnetotail . in addition , current growth at 3d nulls has been observed in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "while the relationship between reconnection at a separator ( defined by a null - null line ) and reconnection at a single 3d null point is not well understood , it is clear that the two should be linked in some way .",
    "kinematic models anticipate that null points and separators are both locations where current singularities may form in ideal mhd @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also expected that 3d nulls @xcite and separators @xcite may each collapse to singularity in response to external motions .",

    "we observe that our models may point towards 3d nulls as a possible site where turbluent reconnection might take place .",
    "finally in section [ conc ] we give a summary .",
    "the evolution of a magnetic field is said to be ideal if @xmath0 can be viewed as being frozen into some ideal flow , i.e.  there exists some @xmath7 which satisfies @xmath8 or equivalently @xmath9 everywhere . in order for the evolution to be ideal , @xmath7 should be continuous and smooth , such that it is equivalent to a real plasma flow . examining the component of eq .",

    "( [ idealohm ] ) .",
    "these configurations may contain isolated null points , or pairs of null points connected by separators @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate in what follows on the case where isolated null points are present .",

    "( [ idealind ] ) if the non - ideal region is embedded in an ideal region ( i.e.  is spatially localised in all three dimensions ) , as this imposes a ` boundary condition ' on @xmath11 within the ( non - ideal ) domain .",
    "if field lines link different points ( say @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) on the boundary between the ideal and non - ideal region , then this imposes a constraint on allowable solutions for @xmath11 within the non - ideal region , since they must be consistent with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it has recently been claimed by boozer @xcite that the evolution of the magnetic field in the vicinity of an isolated 3d null point can always be viewed as ideal .",
    "however , we will demonstrate in the following section that in fact certain evolutions of a 3d null are prohibited under ideal mhd , and must therefore be facilitated by non - ideal processes .",
    "furthermore , in subsequent sections we will show that such evolutions are a natural consequence of typical perturbations of a 3d null .",
    "the argument has been proposed @xcite that for generic 3d nulls @xmath15 at the null point , where @xmath16 is the position of the null , which can always be solved for @xmath17 so long as the matrix @xmath18 is invertible . for a ` generic ' 3d null with @xmath19",

    "( [ idealind ] ) ( when expanded using the appropriate identity ) when considering the behaviour of the flow around the null .",

    ", the vicinity of the null moves like a ` solid body'which seems to preclude any field evolution .",
    "thus , the equation simply states that the field null remains , supposing no bifurcations occur  it shows that the null point can not disappear , but does not describe the flux velocity in any finite volume around the null .",
    "this argument  that the velocity of the null and the value of the flux - transporting velocity at the null need not necessarily be the same  has been made regarding 2d x - points by greene @xcite .",

    "as will be shown in what follows , in certain situations , it is not possible to find a function @xmath11 which is ( or in particular whose gradient @xmath24 is ) well - behaved at the null point ( smooth and continuous ) .",
    "this is demonstrated below by analysing the properties of the function @xmath11 with respect to _ any _ arbitrary boundary conditions away from the null point itself . by beginning at the null point and extrapolating @xmath11 outwards",
    ", it may indeed be possible to choose @xmath11 to be well - behaved at the null , but this @xmath11 must not be consistent with any physical ( i.e.  smooth ) boundary conditions on physical quantities such as the plasma flow .",
    "in fact , it has been proven by hornig and schindler @xcite that no smooth ` flux velocity ' or velocity of ` ideal evolution ' exists satisfying eq .",
    "( [ idealind ] ) if the ratios of the null point eigenvalues change in time .",
    "they have shown that under an ideal evolution , the eigenvectors ( @xmath25 ) and eigenvalues ( @xmath26 ) of the null evolve according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant . from the second equation it is straightforward to show that the ratio of any two of the eigenvalues must be constant in time .",
    "note finally that the assumption that @xmath19 rules out the possibility of bifurcation of null points .",
    "while it is non - generic for @xmath29 to persist for a finite period of time , when multiple null points are created or annihilated in a bifurcation process , a higher order null point is present right at the point of bifurcation , and @xmath30 passes through zero .",
    "such bifurcation processes are naturally occurring , and clearly require a reconnection - like process to take place .",

[ wnonsmooth](a ) ) . examining the expression for @xmath35 ,",
    "it is apparent that the problematic terms are those in @xmath91 ( since @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) . in order to cancel out all of these terms",

    "this is simply equivalent to transferring the non - smoothness to the vicinity of the spine instead of the fan .",
    "thus , there is no choice of boundary conditions which can possibly render the evolution ` ideal ' .",
    "the example discussed above demonstrates that in an ideal plasma , it is not possible for a 3d null point to evolve in the way described , with the spine and fan opening / closing towards one another .",
    "therefore , if such an evolution is to occur , non - ideal processes must become important .",

    "the change in time of the eigenvalues [ see fig .  [ eigangle](b ) ] , and their ratios , is linked to that of the eigenvectors .",
    "the eigenvalues stay constant in time during the early evolution , but then begin to change , although they each follow the same pattern ( i.e.  they maintain their ratios , between approximately @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) .",

    "further indications that non - ideal processes are important at the null are given by the presence of a component of @xmath90 parallel to @xmath0 ( @xmath146 ) which develops there .",
    "the presence of a current sheet at the null , together with a parallel electric field , is a strong indication that reconnection is taking place in the vicinity of the null ( we actually expect that field lines change their connectivity everywhere within the volume defined by the current sheet ( the ` diffusion region ' ) , not only at the null itself @xcite , which is special only in that the footpoint mapping is discontinuous there ) .    it can be shown @xcite that @xmath168 provides a measure of the reconnection rate at the null .",
    "this quantity gives an exact measure of the rate of flux transfer across the fan surface when the non - ideal region is localised around the null point .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath146 within the domain when it reaches its temporal maximum is closely focused around the @xmath69-axis ( see fig .  [ isoepar ] ) .",

    "provide an indication of the nature of the sheet .",
    "firstly we consider the scaling of the current sheet with the magnitude of the boundary driving velocity .",
    "in particular , we look at the maximum current density which is attained ( which invariably occurs at the null ) , the maximum reconnection rate ( calculated as the integrated parallel electric field along the fan field line coincident with the @xmath69-axis , as described previously ) , and also the current sheet dimensions @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( taken to be the full width at half maximum in each coordinate direction ) .",

    "the extent of the current sheet in @xmath80 ( @xmath180 ) increases linearly with @xmath124 , which is a signature of the increased collapse of the null .",
    "by contrast , @xmath181 decreases with increased driving velocity .",
    "this is rather curious and seems counter - intuitive .",
    "it appears that the current sheet is more intense and more strongly focused at the null for stronger driving .",
    "in addition though , it is a result of the fact that an increasing amount of the current is able to be taken up in a straight spine - fan spanning current sheet , rather than spreading in the fan plane .",
    "likewise the scaling of @xmath182 is also curious ",
    "the current sheet is more intense and strongly focused at the null for stronger driving .",
    "the above scaling analysis has also been performed for the case where the spine is displaced by the same amount each time , but at different rates .",
    "that is , as @xmath124 is increased , @xmath125 is decreased to compensate .",
    "in fact the scaling results are very similar to those above , but just with a slightly weaker dependence on @xmath124 .",

    "we focus on whether the current sheet continues to grow when it is continually driven , or whether it reaches a fixed length due to some self - limiting mechanism . as before ,",
    "one of the major issues we run into between different simulation runs which use different parameters is in the geometry of the current sheet . for simplicity here we consider a case with sufficiently strong driving that the current sheet is approximately straight , spanning the spine and fan , as in fig .  [ jsheetstrongdr](a ) .",
    "there are many problems which make it hard to determine the time evolution of the current sheet length . during the initial stage of the sheet formation",

    "there is no sign though of any evidence which points to a halting of this growth .",
    "similarly , examining the evolution of @xmath182 , it seems to continue increasing for as long as we can run the simulations .",

    "[ sheetlent](c ) ) , there is again no sign of them reaching a saturated value .",
    "the slowing of the current sheet growth ( dimensions and modulus ) is undoubtedly down to the diffusion and reconnection which occurs in the current sheet .    in summary",
    ", it is difficult to be definitive that the current sheet will grow to system - size under continuous driving , due to the computational difficulties of running for a long time .",
    "however , there is no indication that the dimensions of the current sheet are limited by any self - regulating process .",
    "rather , the dimensions are determined by the boundary conditions ( i.e.  the degree of shear imposed from the driving boundaries at a given time ) .",
    "thus , if it were computationally possible to continue the shearing indefinitely , it appears that the sheet would continue to grow in size and intensity .",
    "if the system size is large and the resistivity is low , it is possible that the extended current sheet may break up into secondary islands , which lie beyond the scope of the present simulations .",
    "a crucial aspect of any reconnection model which hopes to explain fast energy release is the scaling of the reconnection rate with the dissipation parameter .",
    "mechanisms for turbulent reconnection have been put forward which predict reconnection rates which are completely independent of the resistivity @xcite .",
    "recent work by eyink and aluie @xcite , who obtain conditions under which alfv ' en s `` frozen flux '' theorem may be violated in ideal plasmas , has placed rigourous constraints on models of turbulent reconnection .",
    "the breakdown of alfv ' en s theorem occurs over some length scale defined by the turbulence , which may be much larger than typical dissipative length scales .",
    "eyink and aluie demonstrate that in such a turbulent plasma , a necessary condition for such a breakdown to occur is that current and vortex sheets intersect one another .",
    "this is a rather strong condition on the nonlinear dynamics underlying a turbulent mhd plasma .",
    "( note that in order to correspond to any type of reconnection geometry , more than two current / vortex sheets should intersect , or equivalently they should each have multiple ` branches ' , as in fig .  [ curvort ] , say along the separatrices .",
    "this ensures a non - zero electric field at the intersection point , unlike in the simplified example of eyink and aluie . )    one possible viewpoint of how such a situation might occur is that these current sheets and vortex sheets are generated by the turbulent mechanism itself .",
    "alternatively , one might imagine another situation in which the result might be applicable is in a configuration where macro - scale current sheets and vortex sheets are present in the laminar solution , which may then be modulated by the presence of turbulence .",
    "the results discussed in the previous sections point towards 3d null points as sites where this might occur .",
    "firstly , examining the vorticity ( @xmath194 ) profile in the simulations , we find that in fact a highly localised region of strong vorticity is indeed present .",
    "furthermore , this region intersects with the region of high current density ( see fig .",
    "[ curvort ] ) and is focused at the null ( and possibly spread along the fan surface as described above , depending on the choice of parameters ) .",
    "plane through the null , at the time of peak current , for parameters as in sec .",
    "[ v0scale ] , with @xmath155 . ]",
    "it also appears from the figure that in fact the vorticity profile forms in narrower layers than the current ( in the @xmath185-plane ) , one focused along the spine , with a much stronger layer in the fan ( while the current sheet spans the spine and fan ) , so that rather than being completely coincident , the @xmath195 and @xmath194 sheets really do ` intersect ' .",
    "the rates at which @xmath195 and @xmath194 fall off in @xmath69 away from the null are also very similar .",
    "moreover , we have seen in sec .",
    "[ kinex ] that in order for a null point to evolve in certain ways , non - ideal processes are required . when the ideal system is supposed to evolve in such a way , a non - smooth velocity profile results , which typically shows up along either the spine or fan of the null , or both , depending on the boundary conditions .",
    "this non - smooth velocity corresponds to a singular vortex sheet .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that in non - laminar magnetic fields , 3d nulls are expected to cluster together , creating ` bunches ' of nulls @xcite , thus providing the possibility that multiple coincident current and vortex sheets might be closely concentrated .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the mhd evolution , and current sheet formation , at 3d magnetic nulls . in complex 3d fields ,",
    "isolated nulls are often considered less important sites of energetic phenomena than separator lines , due to the viewpoint that ideal mhd singularities in kinematic analyses are a result of the choice of boundary conditions . however , as demonstrated here ( and proven in ref .",
    "[ ] ) , certain evolutions of a 3d null are prohibited under ideal mhd , specifically those which correspond to a time dependence in the eigenvalue ratios of the null .",
    "we presented a particular example which demonstrates this , for the case where the angle between the spine and fan changes in time .",
    "the flow which advects the magnetic flux in the chosen example is shown to be non - smooth at the spine and/or fan for _ any _ choice of external boundary conditions .",
    "for typical boundary conditions ( as required by say a line - tied boundary such as the solar photosphere , or at another null in the system ) the flow will be singular .",
    "thus non - ideal processes are always required to facilitate such an evolution .",
    "we presented the results of resistive mhd simulations which demonstrated that this evolution is a generic one .",
    "we went on to investigate the process of current sheet formation at such a 3d null in the simulations .",
    "the null was driven by shearing motions at the spine boundary , and a strong current concentration was found to result , focused at the null . the spine and fan of the null close up on one another , from their initial orthogonal configuration .",
    "depending on the strength of the driving , the current sheet may be either spread along the fan of the null , or almost entirely contained in a spine - fan spanning sheet ( for stronger driving ) .",
    "the structure of the sheet is of exactly anti - parallel field lines in the shear plane at the null , with the intensity of @xmath195 falling off in the perpendicular direction due to the linearly increasing field component in that direction , which is continuous across the current sheet . repeating our simulations but driving at the fan footpoints instead of the spine , a very similar evolution is observed .",
    "the current is still inclined to spread along the fan rather than the spine for weaker driving , consistent with relaxation simulation results @xcite .",
    "this is natural due to the shear driving , and the disparity in the structures of the spine and fan .",
    "the spine is a single line to which field lines converge , and the natural way to form a current sheet there is to have those field lines spiral tightly around the spine line .",
    "this field structure however is synonymous with a current directed parallel to the spine , and is known to be induced by rotational motions , rather than shearing ones @xcite .",
    "in addition to the current sheet at the null , indications that non - ideal processes and reconnection should take place there are given by the presence of a localised parallel electric field .",
    "the maxima of this parallel electric field occur along the axis perpendicular to the shear ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the integral of @xmath146 along the field line which is coincident with this axis ( by symmetry ) gives the reconnection rate @xcite , which grows to a peak value in time before falling off after the driving is switched off .",
    "field lines are reconnected both across the fan and around the spine as the null collapses .    as to the quantitative properties of the current sheet , its intensity and dimensions are linearly dependent on the modulus of the boundary driving .",
    "in addition , under continual driving , we find no indications which suggest that the sheet does not continue to grow ( in intensity and length ) in time .",
    "that is , its length does not appear to be controlled by any self - regulating mechanism . rather , its dimensions at a given time are dependent on the boundary conditions ( the degree of shearing ) .",
    "finally , with respect to a recent theorem of eyink and aluie @xcite , our results suggest 3d nulls as a possible site of turbulent reconnection .",
    "their theorem states that turbulent reconnection may occur at a rate independent of the resistivity only where current sheets and vortex sheets intersect one another .",
    "we find that strong vorticity concentrations are in fact present in our simulations , and are localised at the null and clearly intersect the current sheet .",
    "moreover , in the ideal limit , our kinematic model demonstrates that as the spine and fan collapse towards one another , the vorticity at the fan ( or spine , or both ) must be singular ( due to the non - smooth transport velocity ) .",
