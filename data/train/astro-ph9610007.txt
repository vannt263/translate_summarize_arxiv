    "the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ is sensitive in the energy range 30 mev to 30 gev ( thompson  1993 ) .",
    "it has detected @xmath750 agn ( montigny  1995 , thompson  1995 , mattox  1996a ) in the blazar class ( by which we mean the ensemble of bl lac objects , high polarization quasars ( hpq ) , and optical violently variable ( ovv ) quasars ) .",
    "the absence of pair - production absorption in the egret spectra and the fact that only sources which show parsec scale radio jet structure have been identified as egret sources indicate that the hard @xmath8-rays are emitted in a relativistic jet directed toward us .",
    "most models feature inverse compton scattering as the  emission mechanism , but there is not a consensus as to the origin of the low energy photons which are scattered . it has been suggested that they might originate within the jet as synchrotron emission ( maraschi ghisellini & celotti 1992 ; bloom & marscher 1993 ) .",
    "this is designated as the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process .",
    "another possibility is that the low energy photons come from outside of the jet .",
    "this is designated as the external compton scattering ( ecs ) process .",
    "dermer , schlickeiser , & mastichiadis ( 1992 ) suggested that they come directly from an accretion disk around a blackhole at the base of the jet .",
    "it was subsequently proposed that the dominant source of the low energy photons for scattering could be re - processing of disk emission by broad emission line clouds ( sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ; blandford & levinson 1995 , levinson & blandford 1995 ; levinson 1996 ) .",
    "ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) suggest that the dominant source of low energy photons for scattering is broad - line - region re - processing of jet synchrotron emission .",
    "hartman  ( 1996 ) find that the multiwavelength spectra of 3c 279 can be adequately fit with either a ssc model or an ecs model in both the high and low states .",
    "the correlation of multiwavelength variability promises a means to distinguish the ssc and the ecs models .",
    "however , this is difficult because the sensitivity of egret is insufficient to resolve variation on time scales shorter than @xmath71 week when blazars are faint , and intense @xmath8-ray  flares are infrequent .",
    "because of this , we proposed that a `` quick look analysis '' of egret data be done to detect a  flare in progress .",
    "this lead to our observation of pks1622@xmath0297 .",
    "pks1622@xmath0297 has not received much attention previously ( being located in the galactic center region , l=348.82 , b=13.32 ) .",
    "it is not cataloged by hewitt & burbidge ( 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "no optical polarization measurement , nor search for rapid optical variability has been previously reported .",
    "however , the radio properties indicate that it belongs to the blazar class .",
    "a 5 ghz flux density of 1.92jy and a spectral index of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) were reported by khr  ( 1981 ) .",
    "steppe  ( 1993 ) report 90ghz flux densities at three epochs of 1.5 , 1.8 , and 2.0 jy ; and one 230ghz observation at a flux density of 1.0 jy .",
    "preston  ( 1985 ) report a vlbi correlated flux density at 2.29ghz of 0.29jy , 13% of the total .",
    "impey & tapia ( 1990 ) report a 5 ghz radio polarization of 4.6% .",
    "it was optically identified by torres & wroblewski ( 1984 ) at 21 mag , and by saikia  ( 1987 ) at 20.5 mag .",
    "a red shift of @xmath11  is reported in the pks catalog ( wright & otrupcek 1990 ) .",
    "pks1622@xmath0297 was detected by rosat during the sky survey at a flux of 3.2@xmath120.8 erg @xmath2s@xmath3 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy band ( voges 1996 ) .",
    "pks 1622@xmath0297 has been deeply exposed previously by egret . a likelihood analysis ( mattox  1996b ) of the sum of egret exposure for the first half of the mission ( 4/22/91  10/04/94 , a total exposure of 1.49 @xmath13 s ) yields a 95% confidence upper limit of @xmath14@xmath2s@xmath3 ( e @xmath4 100 mev ) .",
    "it was much brighter during our cycle 4 observation .",
    "the exposure is given in table 1 for each cycle 4 viewing period ( vp ) .    .",
    "gro exposure for pks 1622@xmath0297 during cycle 4 .",
    "egret exposure is for the energy selection e  @xmath4  100 mev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the position determined by likelihood analysis ( mattox  1996b ) with the egret data ( e@xmath4100 mev , vp 421.0  423.5 ) is j2000 ra = 246.49 , dec=@xmath029.95 .",
    "the region of position uncertainty is nearly circular with a radius of 15  at 95% confidence .",
    "the significance of the detection is 25@xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath8-ray position estimate is consistent with pks1622@xmath0297 , differing by 6 .",
    "we use the method of mattox  ( 1996a ) to assess the reliability of this identification .",
    "this method uses the number density of potentially confusing sources which are as flat as pks1622@xmath0297 and as bright at 5 ghz , the fraction of @xmath71  jy sources detected by egret , and considers where pks1622@xmath0297 is located in the egret position error ellipse .",
    "because flat - spectrum sources with a flux density of at least 1.9 jy are rare ( 1 per 500 square degrees ) , the identification is good . assuming a prior probability of 5.4% that pks1622@xmath0297 is a  source ( this is the fraction of blazars of this radio flux which egret detects , mattox  1996a ) , the formal confidence of a correct identification is 99.6% . we show below that the @xmath8-ray source exhibits dramatic variability .",
    "the only type of identified egret source which shows this type of variability is the blazar type of agn . because pks1622@xmath0297 is the only bright radio source with blazar properties near the egret position , the identification is even more secure than the formal confidence given above .",
    "the observations shown in table 1 have been analyzed to obtain an egret light curve for the event energy selection e @xmath4 100 mev .",
    "the exposure was binned according to the quality of the egret sensitivity and the strength of the emission to obtain as much time resolution as possible given the statistical limitations imposed by the very sparse egret data . the egret sensitivity to pks 1622@xmath0297",
    "was limited because it was observed at a substantial off - axis angle ( except during vp 423.5 ) and the response of egret at the time was about half of what it originally was ( sreekumar  1996 indicate a response in vp 423 of 42% of the original response for e @xmath4 100 mev ) due primarily to degradation of the spark - chamber gas .    maps of counts and exposure were constructed for adjoining time intervals",
    ". a likelihood analysis ( mattox  1996b ) of these maps was done to obtain flux estimates .",
    "the substantial flux of pks 1622@xmath0253 ( egret team publication , in preparation ) was simultaneously fit in order to include it in a background model .",
    "we have also looked carefully at nearby  source 2eg j1631 - 2845 during our observation .",
    "it is not significantly detected in the sum of vp 421.0 thru 423.5 .",
    "the 95% confidence flux upper limit is @xmath16@xmath2s@xmath3 ( e @xmath4 100 mev ) .",
    "a search for a short timescale flare of 2eg j1631 - 2845 found only the expected indication of variability due to nearby pks 1622@xmath0297 .",
    "the result for pks 1622@xmath0297 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the flux is observed to vary dramatically during this observation .",
    "a major flare occurred at mjd 49894 ( mjd @xmath17 jd @xmath0 2400000.5 ) .",
    "the maximum flux was @xmath18@xmath2s@xmath3 ) for the 0.14 day bin centered on mjd 49892.77 .",
    "this small bin was chosen after the analysis of cumulative counts described below .",
    "it is expected that this maximum flux is somewhat enhanced by selection .",
    "the cumulative counts analysis described below indicates that the apparent decrease in flux between this bin and the subsequent bin has a 1.5% probability of being statistical . a more conservative estimate of the maximum flux of @xmath1@xmath2s@xmath3 ( e @xmath4 100 mev ) results from an analysis of the combination of these two bins and the following bin ( mjd 49892.7  49893.7 ) .",
    "the determination of the minimum time scale of variability of the high - energy @xmath8-ray  flux of blazars is not straight forward because of the sparse egret statistics .",
    "the average flux of pks 1622@xmath0297 in cycle 4 divided by the average egret sensitivity is a count rate of @xmath71/hour .",
    "however , the flare at mjd 49894 to a flux @xmath75 times this average potentially provides the statistics to detect variability on a short time scale .",
    "therefore , the data has been examined in detail .",
    "the available information is summarized in the time history of cumulative counts shown in figure 2 .",
    "this figure indicates that the onset of the mjd 49894 flare was rapid .",
    "there were 5 counts detected in the orbit at mjd 49892.72 and 7 counts in the next orbit .",
    "in all eight preceding orbits , only 3 counts were detected .",
    "unfortunately , the last of these eight orbits had only a small amount of exposure due to limited availability of tdrss satellites for telemetry downlink .",
    "this increases the difficulty of determining the time and time scale of the flare onset ( intensifying the problem caused by sparse statistics ) .",
    "we will begin by finding a time scale for which the significance of a flux increase is beyond dispute .",
    "the significance of variability is assessed by a comparison of the observed cumulative counts and those expected for an invariant flux .",
    "the standard kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test uses the maximum of the absolute value of the difference between observed and expected cumulative counts .",
    "kuiper s variant of this test ( press  1992 ) uses the sum of the maximum positive difference and the absolute value of the maximum negative difference . for figure 2 ,",
    "the maximum positive and negative differences are 18.0 and 31.5 counts respectively .",
    "confirming what is obvious by glancing at figure 1 , the significance of variation using kuiper s variant of the ks test is for the interval mjd 49889.5  49897.5 .",
    "now that variability has been established , we may confidently seek variability in shorter intervals .",
    "we apply the standard ks test to the ten orbit interval described above , mjd 49892.192 thru 49892.812 .",
    "the maximum deviation of the observed counts from those expected for invariant flux is 8.5 counts at mjd 49892.68 ( where a cumulative 11.5 of 15 counts is expected for invariant flux ) .",
    "the corresponding significance of variability is 6 .",
    "the high significance reported above for flux variation in the 8 day interval allows us to obtain this result with not more than 10 trial intervals .",
    "now that we have established that a significant flux increase occurred at mjd 49892.7 , it is possible to examine the extent to which shorter time scale can be deduced .",
    "this can be done without substantial trials to dilute the significance of the result because we examine a very limited number of sub - intervals within the interval for which a significant flux increase has already been established .",
    "we apply the ks test to the five orbits ending with the two bright orbits ( mjd 49892.517  49892.812 ) .",
    "the expected time history of the invariant flux for this interval is shown with a short , thin line in figure 2 .",
    "the maximum deviation of the observed counts is 5.7 counts at mjd 49892.68 ( where a cumulative 6.7 of 13 counts is expected for invariant flux , and 1 is observed ) .",
    "the standard ks test indicates a flux increase with a significance of 9 .",
    "this implies a flux increase in less than 7.1 hours with 99% confidence .",
    "it is conventional to report the observed time for a doubling of the flux .",
    "however , it is not possible to measure a doubling time directly in this instance because of limited statistics .",
    "a likelihood analysis for the 3 day interval before the flare ( 9889.7  9892.7 ) yields a flux of @xmath19@xmath2s@xmath3 ( e @xmath4 100 mev ) .",
    "this flux uncertainty is the 1@xmath15 error .",
    "the conservative peak flux obtained above is @xmath20 .",
    "an integration of the probability distribution function for the factor by which the flux increases obtained from the ratio of these two gaussian distributions ( papoulis 1991 ) , @xmath21 indicates with 95% confidence that the flux increase is greater than a factor of 3.6 . assuming an exponential rise , the corresponding upper limit on the doubling time is 3.8 hours .    a rapid flux decrease is also noted .",
    "a ks test shows variability ( with 99.996% confidence ) for the interval mjd 49886.8  49888.6 .",
    "two brief intervals of high flux are apparent at mjd 49886.85 and 49887.61 .",
    "the second is apparent with a ks test at 99.91% confidence for the interval mjd 49887.593  49887.996 .",
    "the expected time history of the invariant flux for the latter interval is also shown with a short , thin line in figure 2 .",
    "this interval indicates a flux decrease in less than 9.7 hours from a flux of @xmath22 ( during mjd 49887.468  49887.624 ) to @xmath23@xmath2s@xmath3 , e @xmath4 100 mev ( during mjd 49887.660  49887.946 ) .",
    "it is possible that the time scale of the flux change is not resolved with egret , and is much faster .",
    "if so , the observations of the proposed glast satellite ( michelson  1996 ) will be of great interest with 10 times the effective area of egret .",
    "the possibility of a  flux change in less than 1 hour is very interesting .",
    "this would severely constrain the size ( or the doppler factor ) of the  emission region .",
    "the too pointing in vp 423.5 lead to an osse detection ( kurfess  1995 ) .",
    "osse observes in the 50 kev to 10 mev energy range .",
    "its small field of view limits its observations to one object at a time so that coordinated observations of specific egret targets must be planned in advance or arranged via a too .",
    "subsequent to the too pointing , osse was able to continue monitoring pks 1622@xmath0297 during vp 424 with the reduced sensitivity provided by two of the four detectors at an off - axis angle of 2.3 .",
    "we have obtained an osse / egret spectrum for vp 423.5 which is strictly simultaneous .",
    "the counts matrix and the response matrix for the standard egret spectral analysis ( nolan  1993 ) were converted to the xspec format .",
    "the xspec program was used to simultaneously analyze the egret and osse results .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the osse data alone are well represented ( reduced @xmath24 ) by a power law with a photon spectral index of @xmath25 .",
    "the best power - law fit to egret data alone has a photon spectral index of @xmath26 . with a reduced @xmath27 ,",
    "the egret fit is adequate but not compelling .",
    "it appears to break gradually to a steeper spectrum with increasing energy .",
    "similar convexity is apparent in the egret spectra of several other blazars ( see montigny  1995 ) , especially 1633 + 382 ( mattox  1993 ) .",
    "although these osse and egret spectra have the same index , the normalization of the egret spectrum is a factor of 5 larger than that for the osse spectrum at 10 mev . when the osse and egret data are fit together with a single power law , the result shown with the solid line in fig .",
    "3 is obtained .",
    "the photon spectral index is @xmath28 .",
    "the fit is not excellent , but acceptable with a reduced @xmath29 . for comparison ,",
    "the reduced @xmath30 for the total osse and egret data for the two separate power - law fits described above is 0.86 .",
    "the f test indicates that the separate fits do not offer a significant improvement ( with a 14% chance probability ) .",
    "it is clear that the break at a few mev to a harder x - ray spectrum which has been reported for 4 of the 5 blazars previously detected by both egret and osse ( mcnaron - brown  1996 , observations were simultaneous for one object , only contemporaneous for the others ) is not apparent for pks 1622@xmath0297 .",
    "we examined the egret data for evidence of spectral evolution during the flare .",
    "the result is shown in the scatter plot of fig .",
    "we have done a likelihood analysis of the flux for two  energy intervals : the 100  300 mev and e @xmath4 300 mev .",
    "we analyzed time intervals that were as short as possible to provide sensitivity to spectral evolution on the short timescales seen for flux changes .",
    "however , each interval had to be long enough to provide sufficient statistics .",
    "thus , we used shorter time intervals when the flux was large .",
    "the intervals were primarily formed by combining the time bins shown in figure 1 .",
    "however , the b and c intervals correspond to a single interval in figure 1 .",
    "this interval was split after an examination of a scatter plot of event energy verses time indicated that the emission appeared much harder during the first part of the interval .",
    "interval b corresponds to the interval of high flux apparent in figure 2 at mjd 49886.85 .",
    "the exact time intervals can be obtained from the caption of figure 4 .    assuming an invariant spectrum , the ratio of these fluxes is expected to be consistent with that found for an analysis of the total exposure . under this assumption",
    ", it is appropriate to assume the flux ratio observed in the total exposure and fit a single intensity parameter for each time interval . a @xmath30 statistic",
    "is then obtained by summing the deviation of both energy ranges for each time interval .",
    "the result for all 12 time intervals ( @xmath31 for 12 degrees of freedom ) indicates spectral variation with only 77% confidence .",
    "we have also done the analysis with 3 time bins ( 49876.2  49892.7 , 49892.7  49895.6 , 49895.6  49908.6 ) and see colors consistent with an invariant spectrum .",
    "it is interesting that all three intervals which are at a peak in fig.1 ( b , e , & j ) are harder than the average .",
    "this is consistent with the report of mukherjee ( 1996 ) of a marginally significant indication that the egret spectrum of pks 0528 + 134 was harder during an interval of high emission than it was during lower emission level intervals .",
    "the hardest interval is b for which @xmath32 ( for 1 degree of freedom ) .",
    "this corresponds to a 2.4@xmath15 deviation from an invariant spectrum .",
    "the most energetic pks1622@xmath0297 event ( 9.7@xmath121.7 gev ) occurred during this interval at mjd 49886.897 .",
    "we note that the spectrum appears to evolve from hard to soft ( clockwise in figure 4 ) for all 3 peaks .",
    "further observation is required to confirm this indication of spectral evolution of the  emission of blazars .",
    "the large flux of pks 1622@xmath0297 was apparent to the egret team during a routine `` quicklook '' analysis of the vp 421 data .",
    "the news of the detection was conveyed to us on 6/14/95 and triggered our too program .",
    "fortuitously , this followed the first week of a 5 week observation of the galactic center region which included pks 1622@xmath0297 , and this source was opposite the sun .",
    "the detection was announced in an iau circular ( mattox  1995 ) .",
    "we also notified directly a group of multiwavelength observers who had been previously enlisted .",
    "unfortunately , the nearly anti - solar position of pks1622@xmath0297 at the time prevented x - ray observation by either rosat or asca , and the _ rossi _ xte satellite had not yet been launched .",
    "detailed multiwavelength results including multiwavelength spectra will be published latter ( mattox in preparation ) .",
    "we will also report subsequently on possible batse and comptel detections and a possible correlation between the egret and osse flux in vp 423.5 .",
    "extensively optical monitoring of pks 1622@xmath0297 commenced when we learned of the egret detection .",
    "we found that pks 1622@xmath0297 was 3 magnitudes brighter than its quiescent state , and that the brightness was observed to vary by as much as 150% in less than 24 hours .",
    "thus , pks1622@xmath0297 displays optical idv ( intra - day variability ) as do all other blazars detected by egret which have been observed frequently enough for idv to be detected ( wagner 1996 ) .",
    "several radio observations in the mm band occurred which showed a flux density significantly higher than previously observed .",
    "it was also detected by iue ( bonnell  1995 ) during observations on july 1 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and found to be variable . in collaboration with alan marscher , a vlba observation of pks 1622@xmath0297 was made on 7/25/95 .",
    "subsequent observations will be used to search for a new radio component corresponding to the  flare .",
    "the maximum egret flux observed from pks1622@xmath0297 @xmath33@xmath2s@xmath3 , e @xmath4 100 mev ) was a factor of 2 larger than that of the vela pulsar which is normally the brightest egret source .",
    "it is a factor of 4 larger than the flux of 3c 279 at the peak of the 1991 flare ( kniffen  1993 ) .",
    "a peak energy flux of 1.6 ergs @xmath2s@xmath3 for the observed energy range 30 mev to 10 gev is obtained for pks1622@xmath0297 assuming a power law spectrum with photon index of @xmath01.9 .",
    "the corresponding isotropic luminosity is 2.9  erg / s assuming a friedmann universe with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for this luminosity to be less than the standard eddington limit",
    ", the central black hole mass must exceed 2 m@xmath36 .",
    "however the standard eddington limit does not pertain to the  luminosity because the compton scattering cross section in the klein - nishina regime is much smaller than the thomson cross section ( dermer & gehrels 1995 , pohl  1995 ) . using the expression of dermer & gehrels ( 1995 ) for the cross section in the klein - nishina regime for an egret flux of @xmath37@xmath2s@xmath3 ( e @xmath4 30 mev ) , the lower limit for the mass of the pks1622@xmath0297 black hole",
    "is 8 m@xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding limit on the schwarzschild radius is @xmath38 cm .",
    "we apply the `` elliot - shapiro argument '' ( elliot & shapiro 1974 ; dermer & gehrels 1995 ; pohl ; dondi & ghisellini 1995 , we note that they err in assuming the thomson cross section for compton scattering in the klein - nishina regime ) to establish that the  emission must occur in a relativistic jet by showing that a contradiction follows otherwise . under the assumption that the  emission is unbeamed",
    ", the observed upper limit on the doubling time of @xmath39 hours implies that the extent of the emission region is less than @xmath40  cm . the fact that this upper limit is less than lower limit for @xmath41 suggests that the  emission occurs in a medium which is moving relativistically with a lateral extent less than @xmath42(@xmath43 )  cm , and an extent along the jet of less than @xmath44@xmath45  cm , where @xmath46 is the relativistic doppler factor",
    ", @xmath47 is the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the bulk velocity in units of the speed of light .",
    "this argument assumes that the accretion of optically thin material is the immediate source of power for the s. this may not be the case .",
    "accretion energy could be stored in the rotation of a black hole , or in magnetic fields to power the  flare ; or the  flare could result from the accretion of a star . also , for a kerr blackhole , emission could occur as close as @xmath50 .",
    "another argument for  emission in a relativistic jet can be made from the lack of @xmath51 absorption in the  spectrum .",
    "if the emission does not take place in a relativistic jet , the  emission would be absorbed by /x - ray pair production .",
    "mattox  ( 1993 ) derived the expected optical depth under the assumption that the x - rays are produced co - spatially with the s. their expression was in error due a misunderstanding of the definition of luminosity distance .",
    "the corrected expression ( assuming a friedmann universe with @xmath34 ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the time scale of variation in units of @xmath54 seconds , @xmath55 is the observed x - ray flux at a kev , @xmath56 is the x - ray energy spectral index , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the  energy , and @xmath59 .",
    "the luminosity distance error of mattox  ( 1993 ) also affected their expression for the lower limit of the doppler factor .",

    "the lower limit for the doppler factor from equation ( 2 ) ( for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 gev ) is @xmath67 .",
    "we note that the x - ray observation was not simultaneous .",
    "if it were a factor of 3 lower during the  flare , the lower limit on @xmath68 would decrease to 6.6 .",
    "we report the brightest , most luminous  blazar ever detected .",
    "it shows the most rapid  flux change yet seen for any blazar , with a flux doubling time of less than 3.6 hours .",
    "this is the first observation of  idv for a blazar .",
    "we show that the elliot - shapiro argument and the lack of @xmath51 absorption of s indicate that the emission occurred in a relativistic jet .",
    "our results are not inconsistent with the prediction of ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) of an invariant  spectrum throughout the flare .",
    "if their model of compton scattering of synchrotron photons reprocessed in the broad - line region pertains , the lightcurve shown in fig .",
    "1 might indicate the radial profile near the jet of the density of the broad - line region .",
    "romanova and lovelace ( 1996 ) have also developed a model for blazar flares which is consistent with our data . in their model , flares occur when electrons are accelerated by a shock in the jet .",
    "our results do not demonstrate the soft to hard spectral evolution expected for a  emitting jet component emerging from a  photosphere ( blandford & levinson 1995 , levinson & blandford 1995 ; levinson 1996 ) .",
    "however , a comparison of a detailed calculation based on their model to these data must be done before quantitative limits can be placed on their model .",
    "although the statistics of this exposure are not sufficient to establish this beyond doubt , the high - energy  spectrum appears to evolve from hard to soft as a flare progresses , the opposite of the prediction of this model .",

    "<S> this inconsistency suggests that the  emission is beamed . </S>",
    "<S> a minimum doppler factor of 8.1 is implied by the observed lack of pair - production opacity ( assuming x - rays are emitted co - spatially with the s ) . simultaneous observation by egret and osse finds a spectrum adequately fit by a power law with photon index of @xmath01.9 . </S>",
