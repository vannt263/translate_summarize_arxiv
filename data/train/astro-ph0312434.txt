    "rapid energy diffusion in nearly periodic , oscillating potentials is an important phenomenon arising in a variety of physical settings , including collective relaxation in many - body systems interacting via long - range forces .",
    "one example is ` violent relaxation '  @xcite , the process whereby a galaxy involved in a collision or close encounter with another galaxy evolves towards a ( quasi- ) equilibrium .",
    "another is halo formation in an accelerator beam  @xcite , where particles in an initially concentrated bunch are ejected to relatively large distances from the center .",
    "this efficient energy diffusion can often be attributed to parametric resonances between the frequency of the periodic driving and the natural frequencies of the orbits ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) which , for appropriate driving frequencies , tend to make many otherwise regular orbits strongly chaotic  @xcite . however , not all chaotic orbits exhibit systematic energy diffusion . in at least some time - dependent",
    "spherically symmetric systems chaotic orbit segments divide empirically into two types  @xcite .    on the one hand , there are ` sticky ' chaotic segments which are ` locked ' to harmonics of the driving frequency and hence , albeit chaotic with positive finite time lyapunov exponents , do not exhibit systematic drifts in energy . on the other , there are ` wildly ' chaotic segments which are not so locked and , as such , can and do drift in such a fashion as to exhibit large - scale energy diffusion .",
    "however , this distinction between ` sticky ' and ` wildly ' chaotic is not absolute . if , _ e.g. , _ a sticky orbit is integrated long enough , it can become unstuck and start behaving as a wildly chaotic orbit",
    "nevertheless , the time required for such a transition can be quite long , hundreds of orbital times @xmath5 or more .",
    "this transitional behavior appears analogous , at least qualitatively , to diffusion through cantori in two - degree - of - freedom hamiltonian system .",
    "cantori act as ` entropy barriers ' which impede , but do not prevent , phase space transport  @xcite .",
    "however , barrier penetration in such systems can be dramatically accelerated by allowing for noise  @xcite@xcite which , by wiggling the orbits , helps them to ` find ' suitable holes .    in this setting noise too acts via a resonant coupling @xcite .",
    "white noise , which has zero autocorrelation time and power at all frequencies , tends to be comparatively efficient as a source of accelerated phase space transport .",
    "by contrast , colored noise , with a finite autocorrelation time , tends to be efficient only if the autocorrelation time is less than or comparable to the orbital time scale , so that the noise has substantial power at frequencies for which the orbits have power .    an obvious question ,",
    "therefore , is whether transitions between sticky and wildly chaotic orbits in time - dependent hamiltonian systems can also be accelerated by noisy perturbations .",
    "here there are ( at least ) two different types of ` noise ' to consider .",
    "there is of course the possibility of ` ordinary ' noise , either intrinsic or extrinsic ( see , _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) , incorporated simply as an extra term in the equations of motion , just as for a time - independent hamiltonian system .",
    "however , there is also the possibility of allowing for a ` noisy ' driving frequency , _",
    "i.e. , _ allowing the frequency to vary in a ( near-)random fashion . even a modest ` wiggling ' of the frequency might weaken the resonant couplings , thus decreasing the effects of periodic driving .    in all this",
    ", one is interested primarily in the effects of low - amplitude perturbations .",
    "after all , it is obvious that , for sufficiently large perturbations , solutions to the perturbed problem will be very different from solutions to the unperturbed problem .",
    "the real question is _ whether relatively small perturbations , which act in ` real ' systems but which one might naively exclude in physical modeling , are sufficiently important that they can not be safely ignored_. for example , even relatively low amplitude oscillations in the bulk potential associated with a charge - particle beam can prove important by facilitating the ejection of charges to an extended outer halo ; and allowing for modest frequency variations can actually make the effect more pronounced  @xcite .    section ii focuses on the empirical distinctions between sticky and wildly chaotic orbits in a strictly periodic potential , addressing , in particular , the issue of robustness .",
    "earlier work established that these distinctions exist in spherically symmetric potentials .",
    "however , the situation is less clear for more complex potentials .",
    "what happens if , for instance , chaotic orbits exist even in the absence of the periodic driving ? could this tend to decrease the relative measure of sticky orbit segments or , perhaps , eliminate them altogether ?",
    "section iii focuses on the role of ` ordinary ' noise , modeled as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process ; and section iv considers the role of random variations in the driving frequency .",
    "section v summarizes the principal conclusions and then comments on potential implications .",
    "the objective here is to show that absolute distinctions between regular and chaotic orbits and short - time distinctions between ` sticky ' and ` wildly ' chaotic orbit segments , observed  @xcite in time - dependent one - dimensional , _",
    "e.g. , _ spherically symmetric , potentials persist in more realistic time - dependent three - dimensional potentials ; and to investigate for several examples how the relative measures of different orbit types depend on properties of the potential .",
    "attention focuses on time - dependences of the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 an unperturbed time - independent potential .",
    "two classes of potentials @xmath7 were considered , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 each with @xmath10 for spherical systems , with @xmath11 , these reduce to integrable potentials well known from galactic astronomy .",
    "the former corresponds via the poisson equation to a so - called plummer density distribution with a smooth central core ( see , _",
    "@xcite ) ; the latter yields a @xmath12 cuspy dehnen  @xcite density distribution similar to that observed in many galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the nonspherical generalizations of the plummer potential tend not to admit many chaotic orbits but , for appropriate choices of axis ratios , the nonspherical dehnen potentials do admit significant measures of chaotic orbits . for the intermediate energies @xmath13 used for the numerical experiments described in this paper , a typical orbital time scale @xmath14",
    ".    ensembles of @xmath15 initial conditions were generated by uniformly sampling an ( unperturbed ) constant energy hypersurface , and these initial conditions were then evolved for a time @xmath16 , allowing for a driving frequency @xmath17 so chosen as to trigger parametric resonance .",
    "the integrations also solved simultaneously for the evolution of a linearized perturbation , thus facilitating an estimate of the largest finite time lyapunov exponent @xmath18 .",
    "orbital data recorded at fixed intervals were fourier - transformed and the resulting data analyzed to establish correlations between the value of the largest lyapunov exponent and the frequencies for which the @xmath19- , @xmath20- , and @xmath21-coordinates of the orbits have the most power .",
    "for all the models that were tested , involving pulsations of both integrable and nonintegrable potentials @xmath7 , the orbits divide naturally into two distinct types , namely regular and chaotic , between which transitions appear impossible .",
    "estimates of the largest lyapunov exponent for the regular orbits decay towards zero in the usual way ( see , _",
    "@xcite ) ; for chaotic orbits they remain strictly positive  @xcite .",
    "moreover , regular orbits appear multiply periodic , whereas the fourier spectra of chaotic orbits are broader band .",
    "it also appears that chaotic orbit segments subdivide into ` sticky ' and ` wildly ' chaotic .",
    "sticky chaotic segments are clearly chaotic in the sense that they have positive finite time lyapunov exponents and more complex fourier spectra than do regular orbits .",
    "however , the spectra do exhibit striking regularities .",
    "in particular , the frequencies for which the transforms of the spatial coordinates have the most power are almost exactly equal to a harmonic of the driving frequency @xmath17 . in many cases almost all the power is at that special frequency ; in others there is substantial power at nearby , mostly lower , frequencies but the driving frequency is still clearly dominant . that the orbits appear ` locked ' to a harmonic might suggest that their energies can not change significantly , a prediction which is readily confirmed .",
    "plots of @xmath22 for sticky orbit segments often look nearly periodic visually , and the associated fourier spectra @xmath23 tend to be very sharply peaked ( although there is always some ` scruff ' indicating that the energy is not _",
    "exactly _ periodic ) .",
    "wildly chaotic orbits have substantially more complex spectra , and they are not obviously locked to any harmonic of the driving frequency .",
    "rather , as viewed in configuration or energy space , or as characterized by their evolving spectral distributions , it is evident that these wildly chaotic orbits can , and often do , diffuse more or less freely through phase space .",
    "unlike the distinction between regularity and chaos , the distinction between sticky and wildly chaotic is not absolute . if an initially sticky chaotic orbit segment is evolved for a sufficiently long period , it will eventually transform itself into a wildly chaotic orbit .",
    "as discussed elsewhere  @xcite , this suggests that , in the presence of the driving , the chaotic phase space regions are partitioned by ` entropy barriers ' , corresponding , _",
    "e.g. , _ to small holes through which chaotic orbits eventually effuse .",
    "examples of these different types of orbits are exhibited in fig .  1",
    ". here the top row corresponds to a regular orbit , the middle two rows to sticky chaotic segments , and the bottom two to wildly chaotic segments .",
    "one of these wildly chaotic segments remains bound energetically ( @xmath24 ) for the duration of the integration .",
    "the other becomes unbound energetically before @xmath25 . in each case",
    ", the leftmost column exhibits the trajectory of the orbit as viewed in terms of the phase space coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath26 , each recorded at intervals @xmath27 .",
    "the second column exhibits the mean drift in energy , @xmath28 , as a function of time , and the third exhibits the fourier transform of the resulting time series .",
    "the fourth column exhibits estimates of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath18 , computed for times @xmath29 , and the last column exhibits the power spectrum @xmath30 .        as noted already",
    ", the type of orbit correlates not only with the overall shape of the fourier spectrum , but with the value of the peak frequencies for which quantities like @xmath30 or @xmath31 have the most power .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 , which exhibits scatter plots of @xmath18 , the largest finite time lyapunov exponent , and @xmath32 , the frequency for which @xmath30 has the most power .",
    "each panel was generated from the same set of @xmath33 initial conditions .",
    "the four columns from left to right correspond to increasing amplitudes @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the driving frequency @xmath38 , and the orbital structure is dominated by a @xmath39 resonance . in particular , for sticky orbits @xmath30 peaks at @xmath40 .",

    "alternatively , orbit segments with @xmath43 correspond to wildly chaotic orbits .     for regular ( @xmath44 ) , sticky ( @xmath45 ) , and wildly chaotic ( @xmath46 ) orbits , generated from a microcanonical sampling of 800 initial conditions with energy @xmath47 , evolved in a triaxial plummer potential with @xmath48 and driving frequency @xmath49 , integrated for times @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with amplitudes : ( a)-(f ) @xmath55 , ( g)-(l ) @xmath56 , ( m)-(r ) @xmath57 , ( s)-(x ) @xmath58 .",
    ", width=288 ]    for lower amplitude driving , the relative measure of chaotic  as opposed to regular  orbits and the typical size of the largest finite time lyapunov exponents for the chaotic orbits both tend to be smaller .",
    "in particular , for energies and potentials which admit no chaos in the absence of periodic driving , there appears to exist a minimum threshold amplitude , @xmath59 , for the onset of appreciable amounts of chaos . for lower amplitudes , the relative measure of sticky chaotic segments ",
    "as opposed to wildly chaotic segments  also tends to be higher and , as will be discussed later , in some cases the time required for transitions from sticky to wildly chaotic tends to be longer .    of especial interest is the case of potentials which , in the absence of periodic driving , admit large measures of both regular and chaotic orbits . as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , in this case weak driving tends to make some , albeit typically not all , the otherwise regular orbits chaotic ; and the already chaotic orbits tend to remain chaotic .",
    "few if any otherwise chaotic orbits are converted to regular .",
    "however , it is not true that the driving necessarily increases the values of the largest finite time lyapunov exponents for all the otherwise chaotic orbits .",
    "indeed , for sufficiently small @xmath1 the driving is comparably likely to increase or decrease the value of @xmath18 .",
    "significantly , though , as @xmath1 is increased the degree of chaos always appears to increase , at least initially . for sufficiently large values of @xmath1",
    "all the otherwise regular orbits become chaotic and , for the otherwise chaotic orbits , there is a systematic increase in the values of the largest @xmath18 .",
    "however , there will still be a few otherwise chaotic orbits which become less chaotic in the presence of driving .",
    "one other obvious trend evident from fig .",
    "3 is the systematic decrease in the values of @xmath60 at late times .",
    "this decrease reflects the fact that the vast majority of the chaotic orbits have become wildly chaotic , and that many of these have drifted to less negative energies , where the orbital time @xmath5 , and hence the lyapunov time @xmath61 , is very long .",
    "initial conditions with @xmath47 in a triaxial dehnen potential with axis ratios @xmath62 @xmath63 and driving frequency @xmath64 at varying integration times @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath65 , and @xmath54 for : ( a ) - ( e ) @xmath57 , ( f ) - ( j ) @xmath58 and ( k ) - ( o ) @xmath66 . , width=288 ]    whether , in the presence of periodic driving , an initial condition results initially in sticky as opposed to wildly chaotic behavior does not appear to correlate strongly with its behavior in the absence of driving .",
    "for example , there is no obvious preferential tendency for otherwise regular initial conditions to yield sticky behavior . for a fixed potential , the likelihood that an initial condition yields a sticky , as opposed to wildly chaotic , orbit is determined more by the amplitude @xmath1 than by the regular or chaotic behavior exhibited by the initial condition in the absence of periodic driving .",
    "when @xmath1 is small , sticky orbits tend to be more common ; as @xmath1 increases , the relative measure of wildly chaotic segments increases",
    ".    the relative abundance of different orbit types does not appear to exhibit a simple , universal dependence on shape . in some cases , there is more chaos for parameter values where the equipotential surfaces are oblate and/or prolate , rather than spherical ; in others spherical potentials exhibit more chaos .",
    "the one trend that _ does _ emerge , at least for the models considered here , is that genuinely triaxial potentials with @xmath67 tend to exhibit more chaos than potentials with either spherical or spheroidal symmetry .    to quantify at least partially the transition rate between sticky and wildly chaotic behavior , one can , for an orbit ensemble of fixed initial energy , begin by identifying the initial conditions that correspond to chaotic orbits , then identifying the range of energies which , for these initial conditions , correspond to sticky behavior , and finally determining for each orbit generated from a chaotic initial condition the first time that it acquires an energy outside this range .",
    "the obvious quantity of interest is the fraction @xmath68 of those chaotic orbits which have not yet ` escaped ' within time @xmath69 .",
    "when , as for the example presented below , the orbital structure is dominated by a @xmath39 resonance , regular orbits can be rejected immediately as having @xmath70 .",
    "however , the computed fraction does depend somewhat on the precise choice of energy range , which is not completely obvious .",
    "fortunately , though , as discussed below , modest changes do not significantly alter the final results .",
    "examples of such an analysis , all generated for the same ensemble , are exhibited in fig .",
    "4 , each panel of which plots @xmath68 , the relative number of chaotic orbits which are sticky , as a function of time @xmath69 for different choices of amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "the top two panels are for oblate ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) and triaxial ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 ) plummer potentials which , in the absence of driving , admit few if any chaotic orbits .",
    "the lower panels are for oblate and triaxial dehnen potentials with the same axis ratios , which admit a considerable amount of chaos even in the absence of driving . from this figure",
    "two points are immediately evident .",
    "the first is that , in every case , after a very rapid initial decrease , @xmath75 decreases systematically in a fashion that is roughly linear in time .",
    "this implies that , at least in a first approximation , transitions from sticky to wildly chaotic can be viewed a poisson process , @xmath76 with @xmath77 the number of chaotic orbits which are initially sticky and @xmath78 the escape rate .",
    "this exponential decrease is the same behavior observed for diffusion through cantori in two - degree - of - freedom systems ( see , _",
    "@xcite ) , thus reinforcing again the notion that these transitions involve passage through an entropy barrier .     of chaotic orbits that remain",
    "` sticky ' after time @xmath69 , computed for ensembles of @xmath79 initial conditions with energy @xmath47 , evolved in an oblate plummer potential with axis ratio @xmath80 , pulsed with frequency @xmath38 and variable amplitude @xmath1 .",

    "( d ) the same for a triaxial dehnen potential with @xmath48 with @xmath47 and @xmath82 . , width=288 ]    the other striking point is that the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath1 is very different for the plummer and dehnen models . for the plummer models @xmath78 is rather nearly independent of driving amplitude ; but , for the dehnen models @xmath78 increases significantly as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this is an example of a more general result : if , in the absence of driving , the orbits are all regular , @xmath78 exhibits little if any dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "if , however , a significant fraction of the orbits are already chaotic in the absence of driving , @xmath78 is a strongly increasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "the degree of chaos exhibited by a model , as probed by the relative measure of chaotic orbits or the size of a typical finite time lyapunov exponent , need not correlate especially with the amount of chaos that is present in the absence of driving .",
    "however , the presence or absence of chaos in the unperturbed models _ does _ impact the transition rate between sticky and wildly chaotic behavior .",
    "but why do plots of @xmath83 show an initial much more rapid decrease , and how sensitive are these results to the energy range associated with sticky orbit segments ?",
    "the basic conclusion is that increasing the size of the sticky range slows the early time rapid decrease , but has only a minimal impact on the computed transition rate @xmath78 .",
    "the results exhibited in fig .  4 were computed assuming a range @xmath84 , with @xmath85 the initial unperturbed energy and @xmath1 the amplitude of the perturbation , but , in most cases , the best fit @xmath78 changes only by @xmath86 or so if @xmath87 is increased to @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "the validity of this criterion was also tested by comparing the number of orbits that this prescription classifies as sticky at time @xmath89 with the number of orbits which still appear locked to the driving frequency with @xmath90 .",
    "the obvious interpretation is that the initial rapid decrease reflects wildly chaotic orbits which require a finite time to escape from the sticky range : if the range is made larger , the time required for escape becomes longer .",
    "this suggests in turn that the most accurate estimate of the number of sticky orbits involves assuming the smallest range which clearly includes all sticky orbits , the criterion used to justify a value @xmath91 .",
    "given such a choice , one also appears justified in interpreting @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) as the relative fraction of the chaotic orbits which are sticky at or near @xmath92 .    given this interpretation of @xmath77 ,",
    "one can easily estimate the relative abundance of regular , sticky , and wildly chaotic orbits at time @xmath92 .",
    "the results for the ensembles used to construct fig .  4 are exhibited in fig .",
    "it is evident that , in each case , the relative number of chaotic orbits is an increasing function of @xmath1 , but the relative number of initially sticky orbits can vary significantly . for the plummer potentials , the relative measure of sticky orbits tends to be very small irrespective of the magnitude of @xmath1 . for the dehnen potentials ,",
    "however , sticky orbits are comparatively common , especially for smaller amplitude driving .",
    "in particular , for @xmath93 there are more sticky than wildly chaotic orbits for the oblate dehnen potential .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that the relative measure of sticky versus wildly chaotic model need not increase monotonically as a potential is made less symmetric .",
    "for example , ensembles evolved in a spherical plummer potential perturbed with the same amplitude @xmath1 tend to exhibit substantially larger relative measures of sticky orbits .    , plotted as a function of @xmath1 , for the ensembles in fig .  4 , as predicted by the best linear fits . , width=288 ]",
    "assuming that these conclusions are robust , they have obvious implications for chaotic phase mixing in systems subjected to periodic perturbations .",
    "_ relatively low amplitude periodic driving can suffice to trigger large measures of chaotic orbits_. however , these chaotic orbits are apt to be primarily sticky and , as such , unlikely to exhibit large - scale secular changes in energy . in the context of charged - particle beams",
    ", this would suggest that periodic driving could facilitate a comparatively rapid loss of coherence , but that it would not necessarily trigger the formation of a halo . if , however , the amplitude of the driving is increased , a larger measure of the orbits will be wildly chaotic ; and a substantial fraction of these could drift to higher energy states associated with an extended halo .",
    "this expectation is consistent with real experiments involving charged - particle beams ( _ e.g. , _  @xcite ) , which indicate that particle bunches which undergo larger amplitude oscillations ( larger initial ` mismatch ' ) tend to form more extended halos .",
    "the objective now is to describe how distinctions amongst regular , sticky chaotic , and wildly chaotic behavior and , especially , the rate of transitions between sticky and wildly chaotic behavior , are impacted by the introduction of weak perturbations , modeled as friction and/or gaussian noise .",
    "the conclusions derive from an analysis of orbits generated as solutions to the perturbed evolution equation @xmath94 here @xmath95 represents a dynamical friction and @xmath96 is a gaussian - distributed random force which , for specificity , is assumed to sample an ornstein - uhlenbeck process",
    ".    in the context of a galaxy or charged - particle beam , random perturbations associated with an external environment could correspond  @xcite to extrinsic noise , for which @xmath97 .",
    "alternatively , effects associated with graininess or internal substructures could correspond to intrinsic noise , with a nonzero @xmath98 related to the moments of @xmath96 by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",

    "this prescription obviates the necessity of deciding how to relate concrete realizations of a stochastic process at two nearby phase space points .",

    "but how are such data to be interpreted ?",
    "it follows immediately from the langevin equation ( 3.1 ) that , allowing only for periodic driving and additive white noise , the mean energy @xmath129 associated with some ensemble will satisfy @xmath130 where @xmath131 represents an average computed along the orbits .",
    "the noise leads directly to a linear increase in energy at a constant rate @xmath132 , independent of the form of the driving ; the driving occasions an additional increase which will in general depend on the form of the perturbed orbits .",
    "given the mean value @xmath127 computed for orbits that are subjected to both noise and periodic driving , it is thus natural to subtract off the linear increase @xmath133 directly attributable and to compare the residual with the mean @xmath127 computed in the absence of noise .",
    "to the extent that the former quantity is larger , one can infer that noise enhances the energy diffusion associated with periodic driving in the sense that the mean change in energy is larger than what would obtain allowing only for the separate effects of driving and noise .",
    "the results of such an analysis are exhibited in fig .",
    "8 , each panel of which plots the quantity @xmath134 derived for the same set of initial conditions , evolved in the same potential with the same amplitude @xmath1 and same @xmath17 but in the presence of additive white noise with different amplitudes @xmath98 .",
    "for both the plummer and dehnen potentials , it is evident that , at least for low amplitudes @xmath1 , increasing @xmath98 tends to increase @xmath135 , _",
    "i.e. , _ that the noise and driving reinforce one another in a superadditive fashion . however , for higher amplitudes @xmath1 , more variability is observed , the one uniform feature being that the relative degree of reinforcement is less . in this sense",
    ", one can say that _ noise is more important as a source of energy diffusion in systems subjected to relatively low amplitude driving_.    , as defined in [ deltav ] , computed for @xmath79 orbits with initial energy @xmath47 evolved in a pulsating triaxial plummer potential with axis ratio @xmath136 , @xmath38 , and variable amplitude ( a ) @xmath57 and ( b ) @xmath58 .",

    "orbits in three - dimensional potentials subjected to periodic driving , @xmath0 , divide into two distinct types , between which transitions are seemingly impossible : regular orbits , which are strictly periodic and have vanishing lyapunov exponents , and chaotic orbits , which are aperiodic and have at least one positive lyapunov exponent",

    "increasing the amplitude also tends to increase the transition rate between sticky and wildly chaotic behavior , which suggests that the ` holes ' associated with the entropy barriers become larger as @xmath1 increases .",

    "the largest effects arise in the white noise limit of vanishing autocorrelation time @xmath2 and decrease systematically with increasing @xmath2 .",

    "it also acts to accelerate transitions between sticky and wildly chaotic behavior , thus facilitating more efficient energy diffusion .",
    "the effects of noise in frequencies of pulsations have more complex effects .",
    "white noise suppresses the effects of periodic driving by decreasing transitions between sticky and wildly chaotic behavior . colored noise fluctuations , at least for autocorrelation times on the order of the dynamical time , enhances the effects of periodic driving .",
    "these effects gradually turn off in the adiabatic @xmath178 limit .",
    "ordinary noise appears to act by enhancing the effects of the resonances associated with the periodic driving .",
    "wiggling orbital trajectories can allow an otherwise regular orbit to be impacted by a resonance which it might not otherwise ` feel ' , thus causing it to become chaotic . and",
    "similarly , the accelerated rate of transitions between sticky and wildly chaotic behavior can be attributed to the fact that such wiggling helps already chaotic orbits ` find ' holes in the entropy barrier .",
    "indeed , the effect of noise in enhancing such transitions is very similar qualitatively to the effect of noise as a source of accelerated diffusion through cantori in time - independent two - degree - of - freedom hamiltonian systems  @xcite .",
    "random white noise variations in the driving frequency appear to weaken the resonances .",
    "making the frequency ` stutter ' by adding even a very low amplitude , high frequency component to the driving significantly alters the fourier spectra of orbits , suppressing structure which , in the absence of the perturbation , indicates the importance of the resonances .",
