    "there has been a growing interest towards polarons over the last years also in view of the technological potential of polymers and organic molecules @xcite in which polaronic properties have been envisaged .",
    "theoretical investigations on polarons generally start from the holstein hamiltonian @xcite originally proposed for a diatomic molecular chain along which hopping of electrons , linearly coupled to the vibrational quanta , takes place according to a tight - binding description . if the local",
    "_ e - ph _ coupling is sufficiently strong the induced lattice deformation may dress the electron and transform it into a polaronic charge carrier @xcite .",
    "the conditions for polaron formation and its mobility properties may however depend also on the adiabaticity ratio , on dimensionality , on peculiarities and anharmonicities of the lattice structure @xcite . as the holstein hamiltonian can be identically applied to states made of excitons @xcite and phonons it also provides a useful tool in optical spectra analysis and transport properties of organic materials @xcite with large scale applications .",
    "while the physical properties of polaronic systems change @xcite according to the size of the polaronic quasiparticle , a number of theoretical tools @xcite has been applied to clarify nature and width of the crossover between a large ( with respect to the lattice constant ) polaron at weak _ e - ph _ coupling and a small polaron at strong coupling for a given value of the adiabatic parameter .",
    "provided that a phase transition is ruled out in the holstein hamiltonian with dispersive optical phonons @xcite being the ground state energy analytic in the _ e - ph _ coupling , such a crossover may still appear as a smooth transition in the antiadiabatic regime or rather as a sudden ( but continuous ) event in the adiabatic regime @xcite . while the narrowing of the polaron band signals the onset of the crossover it is certainly from the behavior of the effective mass that the self - trapping event can be accurately located in the intermediate region of _ e - ph _",
    "couplings @xcite .",
    "although precisely in the latter region perturbative studies traditionally reveal their shortcomings an analytical method , the modified lang - firsov ( mlf ) transformation , @xcite has been developed to overcome the limitations of the standard lang - firsov ( lf ) @xcite approach on which strong coupling perturbation theory is based . as an enhancement of the polaron mass should be accompanied by a reduction in the polaron size , the electron - phonon correlation function offers an independent tool to analyse the crossover through the measure of the spread of the lattice deformation .",
    "since the notion of self - trapping transition has often assumed different meanings in the literature we emphasize that our view of a _ self - trapped polaron _ is not that of a localized and immobile object but , rather , of a small quasiparticle whose different ground state properties have undergone a transition , driven by the _",
    "e - ph _ coupling , at distinct although closely related points in the polaron parameter space @xcite . among these properties we study in this paper , using the mlf transformation @xcite , the polaron mass and the correlation function as obtained from a holstein hamiltonian in which the _ dispersion _ of the optical phonon branches is fully accounted for in any dimensionality .",
    "besides depicting a model more appropriate to physical systems , dispersive phonons represent a relevant feature of the holstein model itself as previously shown by one of us @xcite .",
    "the role of the intermolecular forces in the crossover of the mlf polarons at different dimensionalities is a main focus of our investigation .",
    "the generalities of the model are given in section ii while the results are presented in section iii both for the polaron mass and for the static correlation function .",
    "section iv contains some final remarks .",
    "we consider the dimension dependent holstein hamiltonian consisting of one electron hopping term , an interaction which couples the electronic density and the ionic displacements at a given site and dispersive harmonic optical phonons as :    @xmath2    the first sum is over @xmath3 nearest neighbors , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the real space electron creation and annihilation operators , @xmath6 is the number operator , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the phonons creation and annihilation operators .",
    "@xmath9 is the fourier transform of @xmath7 and @xmath10 is the frequency of the phonon with vector momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the standard practice in dealing with the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is to apply the lf transformation where a phonon basis of fixed displacements ( at the electron residing site ) is used .",
    "such a choice of phonon basis diagonalizes the hamiltonian in absence of hopping .",
    "the hopping term is then treated as a perturbation .",
    "however the lf approach under simple approximations , @xmath12 within zero - phonon averaging or zeroth order of perturbation , can not describe the retardation between the electron and the lattice deformations produced by the electron .",
    "this retardation induces a spread in the size of the polaron and becomes very important for weak and intermediate @xmath13-ph coupling .",
    "the mlf phonon basis , where the displacements of the oscillators at different sites around an electron are treated variationally , can describe the retardation and a large to small polaron crossover even within simple approximations @xcite .",
    "recently the convergence of the perturbation series within the lf and the mlf methods has been studied in a two - site holstein model for the ground state @xcite as well as for the first excited state @xcite .",
    "it was found that : ( i ) within the mlf method the perturbation corrections are much smaller than those corresponding to the lf method in the range from weak to intermediate @xmath13-ph coupling , ( ii ) the convergence of the perturbation series within the mlf is also much better in that range , ( iii ) in the strong coupling limit the mlf phonon basis reduces to the lf basis and the lf pertubation method works very well in this limit .",
    "the above studies have clearly pointed out that the mlf perturbation method works much better than the lf method when the entire range of the @xmath13-ph coupling is considered .",
    "the mlf perturbation method has also been applied to a many - site holstein model with dispersionless phonons in 1d and the supremacy of the mlf method over the lf method in predicting the ground state energy and dispersion of the polaron has been observed @xcite . for the present case of dispersive phonon",
    "we apply the mlf transformation to the dimension dependent hamiltonian ( 1 ) :    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    and @xmath16s are the variational parameters which represent the shifts of the equilibrium positions of the oscillators ( quantized ion vibrations ) with momentum @xmath11 . for conventional lang - firsov transformation @xmath17 .",

    "as unperturbed hamiltonian we choose @xmath22 as    @xmath23    the remaining part of the hamiltonian ( @xmath24 ) in the mlf basis is considered as the perturbation part .",
    "the energy eigenstates of @xmath22 are given by    @xmath25    where , @xmath26 is the electron site and @xmath27 are the phonon occupation numbers in the phonon momentum states @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the lowest energy eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian has no phonon excitations , @xmath29 for all @xmath11 .",
    "the ground state has an energy @xmath30 and is @xmath31-fold degenerate , where @xmath31 is the number of sites in the system .",
    "the perturbation lifts the degeneracy and to first order in @xmath32 the ground state energy of the 3d- polaron with momentum @xmath33 is given by    @xmath34    and the corresponding eigenstate is @xmath35 .    the second order correction to the ground - state energy of the polaron with momentum @xmath33",
    "is given by    @xmath36    it is evident that the second order correction has contributions from intermediate states having all possible phonon numbers , @xmath37 each @xmath38 in eq .",

    "then , the one phonon excitation process yields no contribution to the second order correction for the mlf ground state energy .",

    "the static correlation function involving the electron charge at _ i - th _ site and the lattice deformation at the _",

    "@xmath46 is the electron number operator and @xmath47= 1/n for the 1-electron system .",
    "while @xmath5 and @xmath8 are the bare electron and phonon annihilation operators in the undisplaced oscillator basis respectively , the corresponding operators in the mlf basis are the annihilation operators for the polaron and that of the phonon in the variationally displaced oscillator basis .",
    "the correlation function is calculated in the mlf basis within zero phonon averaging .",
    "previous investigations have pointed out that the holstein model with a dispersionless spectrum ( @xmath48 ) or with weak intermolecular forces ( @xmath49 ) would predict _ larger polaron bandwidths in lower dimensionality _ against physical expectations @xcite . moreover , as pointed out by holstein in his original papers @xcite , dispersionless phonons would lead to an unphysical _ divergent site jump probability _ for the polaronic quasiparticle @xcite . hence ,",
    "intermolecular forces are a _ key ingredient _ of the holstein model",
    ".    numerical analysis @xcite has shown that the bandwidths @xmath50 grow faster versus the intermolecular energy @xmath51 in higher dimensionality @xmath52 thus providing a criterion to fix the minimum @xmath51 which ensures the validity of the holstein model . imposing the inequalities criterion @xmath53 we set the _ threshold value _",
    "@xmath54 which turns out to be a function of the breathing mode energy @xmath55 and of the @xmath56independent _ e - ph _ coupling @xmath57 ( @xmath58 scales @xmath59 ) : thus , at intermediate @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , in units of @xmath55 ) @xmath54 is @xmath62 , while at strong @xmath60 ( @xmath63 ) @xmath54 should be at least @xmath64 in order to ensure the correct bandwidths trend .",
    "on the other hand , the intermolecular energies encounter the upper bound @xmath65 given by the value of the coupling energy between the two atoms in the basic unit of the molecular solid .",
    "moreover , too large @xmath51 may invalidate strong coupling perturbative treatments of the holstein model for three dimensional systems in fully adiabatic regimes @xcite .    with this caveat",
    "we study the polaron mass both in the lang - firsov and in the modified lang - firsov scheme taking a lattice model in which first neighbors molecular sites interact through a force constants pair potential .",
    "then , the @xmath56 dependent optical phonon spectrum is given by    @xmath66    where the intra - molecular force constant @xmath67 and the inter - molecular first neighbors force constant @xmath68 are related to @xmath55 and @xmath51 by @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "@xmath71 is the reduced molecular mass . in terms of @xmath55 ,",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath72 defines the adiabatic ( @xmath73 ) and the antiadiabatic ( @xmath74 ) regime .",
    "second order perturbative theory introduces the polaron mass @xmath75 dependence on the hopping integral @xmath32 , hence on the adiabatic parameter , which would be absent in the first order lang - firsov theory .",
    "generally , @xmath75 can vary with @xmath76 in two ways : @xmath75 becomes lighter either by increasing @xmath55 at fixed @xmath32 or , by increasing @xmath32 at fixed @xmath55 .",
    "as the mass variation due to @xmath55 is much stronger than that due to @xmath32 , for a given adiabatic parameter , we may get different mass values according to the absolute values of @xmath55 and @xmath32 . however , for sufficiently strong _ e - ph _ couplings which make the perturbative method applicable , the lf mass changes only slightly with @xmath32 and second order corrections are small unless the intramolecular phonon energies are low ( @xmath77 ) @xcite .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath78 and select the adiabatic parameter by tuning @xmath32 .",
    "in figs.1 , we plot the ratio of the one dimensional polaron mass to the bare band mass against the _ e - ph _ coupling calculated both in the lang - firsov scheme and in the modified lang - firsov expression .",
    "an intermediate regime @xmath79 is assumed in fig.1(a ) while the intermolecular energy spans a range of weak to strong values .",
    "the striking different behavior between the lf and the mlf mass occurs for intermediate @xmath58 while at very strong couplings the mlf plots converge , as expected , towards the lf predictions .",
    "the lf method overestimates the polaron mass for @xmath80 $ ] ( according to the value of @xmath51 ) and mostly , it does not capture the rapid mass increase found instead in the mlf description .",
    "note that , around the crossover , the mlf polaron mass is of order ten times the bare band mass in the case @xmath81 .",
    "large intermolecular energies enhance the phonon spectrum thus reducing the effective masses in both figures . in the mlf method , large @xmath51 tend also to smooth the mass behavior in the crossover region .",
    "going to a fully adiabatic regime ( see fig.1(b ) ) the discrepancies between lf and mlf plots are even more pronounced and the range of _ e - ph _ couplings in which the two methods converge shrinks considerably .",
    "there is scarce renormalization in the mlf curves up to the crossover which is clearly signalled by a sudden _ although continuous _ mass enhancement whose abruptness is significantly smoothed for the largest values of intermolecular energies .",
    "in the antiadiabatic case shown in fig.1(c ) , the picture changes drastically and we recover a nearly coincident mass behavior in the lf and mlf methods throughout the whole range of couplings .",
    "the convergence is favoured at large @xmath51 . as above mentioned",
    "the lf plots show a strong resemblance in going from fig.1(a ) to fig.1(c ) : infact , the lf method slightly depends on the hopping integral in 1d systems with large intramolecular energy .",
    "the results we have displayed so far induce to reconsider the concept of _ self - trapping _ traditionally indicating an abrupt , but continuous , transition between an infinite size states at weak _ e - ph _ couplings and a finite ( small ) size polaron at strong _ e - ph _ couplings . according to the adiabatic polaron theory @xcite",
    "there is no self - trapping event in one dimension as the polaron solution is always the ground state of the system . instead",
    ", in higher dimensionality a minimum coupling strength is required to form finite size polarons , hence self - trapped polarons can exist at couplings larger than that minimum . as a shrinking of the polaron size yields a weight increase , the polaron mass behavior is accepted to be the most reliable indicator of the self - trapping transition .",
    "the latter appears to us as a crossover essentially dependent on the degree of adiabaticity of the system and crucially shaped by the internal structure of the phonon cloud which we have modelled by tuning the intermolecular forces .",
    "we are then led to relocate the self trapping event in the parameter space of 1d systems admitting that also finite size polarons can self - trap if a sudden change in their effective mass occurs for some values of the _ e - ph _ couplings in some portions of the adiabatic regime . as fluctuations in the lattice distortions around the electron site",
    "are included in our variational wave function discontinuities in the polaron mass should not appear at the onset of the transition @xcite .",
    "mathematically we select the crossover points through the simultaneous occurence of a maximum in the first logarithmic derivative and a zero in the second logarithmic derivative of the mlf polaron mass with respect to the coupling parameter : such inflection points , corresponding to the points of most rapid increase for @xmath75 , are reported on in figures 2 , where the mass ratios are plotted for a wide choice of antiadiabatic to adiabatic regimes and a sizeable value of @xmath51 both in one , two and three dimensions",
    ".    some well known features of the antiadiabatic polaron landscape are confirmed by our analytical variational model in all dimensionalities : i ) antiadiabatic polarons are generally heavier than adiabatic ones although , at very strong couplings , the mass values converge at the lang - firsov results and ii ) there is no self - trapping in the fully antiadiabatic regime as the electron and the dragged phonon cloud form a compact unit , a small polaron , also at intermediate _",
    "e - ph _ couplings .",
    "then , the mass increase is smooth in the antiadiabatic regime . instead ,",
    "in the more controversial @xcite antiadiabatic to adiabatic transition region we start to detect the signatures of the crossover which persist in the fully adiabatic regime and form a line of self - trapping events whose features however change considerably versus dimensionality . in 1d ( fig.2(a ) ) , the crossover occurs for @xmath58 values between @xmath82 and the corresponding self trapped masses are of order @xmath83 times the bare band mass thus suggesting that relatively light small polarons can exist in 1d molecular solids with high phonon spectrum .",
    "the self - trapped mass values grow versus @xmath58 by increasing the degree of adiabaticity and the incipience of the self - trapping line is set at the intermediate value @xmath84 .",
    "we note that these findings are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with refined variational results supporting the existence of self - trapped polarons also in 1d .",
    "although in the deep adiabatic regime we find a quasi step - like increase , the 1d polaron mass is a continuous and derivable function of the _ e - ph _ coupling @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional lattice introduces some significant novelties in the mlf mass behavior as shown in fig.2(b ) : i ) at a given _ e - ph _ coupling and adiabaticity ratio , the 2d mass is lighter than the 1d mass and the 2d lf limit is attained at a value which is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than in 1d ; ii ) the crossover region is shifted upwards along the @xmath58 axis with the self trapping events taking place in the range , @xmath58 @xmath85 and the corresponding masses are of order @xmath86 times the bare band mass ; iii ) the curve connecting the self trapping points is parabolic with an extended descending branch starting at the intermediate value @xmath87 ; iv ) in the deep adiabatic regime , the lattice dimensionality smoothens the mass increase versus @xmath58 .",
    "the latter effect is even more evident in 3d , see fig.2(c ) , as there are no signs of abrupt mass increase even for the largest values of the adiabatic parameter . at the crossover ,",
    "3d masses are of order @xmath86 times the bare band mass with the self trapping points lying in the range , @xmath58 @xmath88 . at large couplings",
    "the _ effective mass over bare band mass _ ratio becomes independent of the @xmath32 value and converges towards the lf value . in this region ( and for the choice @xmath81 )",
    "the 3d lang - firsov mass is one order of magnitude smaller than the 2d mass . as the coordination number grows versus dimensionality ,",
    "large intermolecular forces are more effective in hardening the 3d phonon spectrum thus leading to lighter 3d polaron masses than 2d ones .    in figures 3",
    "we plot the correlation functions @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 in 1d ( a ) and 2d ( b ) respectively , as obtained by ( 13 ) for the adiabatic regime @xmath92 with @xmath78 .",
    "two values , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , have been chosen to point out the role of the intermolecular forces in the transition between a large polaron at weak couplings and a small polaron at strong couplings .",
    "for sufficiently strong @xmath58 values the lf limit is obtained , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath89 becomes 1 while @xmath90 and @xmath91 become zero implying that the resulting polaron is an on site small polaron .",
    "the small to large polaron cross - over is manifested by a strong reduction of @xmath89 alongwith an enhancement in the values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . by increasing @xmath51 , the crossover is slightly smoothed and shifted upwards along the @xmath58 axis .",
    "accordingly , @xmath90 and ( to a lesser extent ) @xmath91 acquire some weight throughout a larger portion of _ e - ph _ coupling values . as a main feature",
    "we note that the crossovers indicated by the correlation functions of the one dimensional system , for the two selected cases , occur at @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "these values match the corresponding crossover points extracted by the polaron mass slopes . in two dimensions ,",
    "the self - trapping transition takes place at larger ( than in 1d ) @xmath58 values and non local _ e - ph _ correlations persist in the adiabatic polaron up to @xmath97 .",
    "the crossover is generally smooth and the softening effect of the intermolecular forces is more pronounced than in the one dimensional system .",
    "we have developed a variational analytical method to study the holstein polaron problem versus dimensionality in the entire range of ( anti)adiabatic parameters characterizing the molecular system .",
    "the essential role of the phonon dispersion in the holstein model has been accounted for including the intermolecular interactions by means of a force constant approach . unlike the traditional lang - firsov scheme the modified lang - firsov method permits to describe the fact that , in the intermediate and adiabatic regimes , the lattice deformation does not follow instantaneously the electron motion thus leading to a spreading in the quasiparticle size . under these circumstances",
    "we have examined the behavior of the polaron mass as a function of the strength of the _ e - ph _ coupling and critically analysed the occurence of the self - trapping event signalling a shrinking of the polaron size in the real space .",
    "this crossover has been also monitored through the computation of the static _ e - ph _ correlation functions which provide a complementary tool corroborating our conclusions .",
    "varying the adiabatic parameter and selecting the points of most rapid increase for the effective mass we have found a set of self - trapping points originating , in 1d and 2d , in the intermediate regime ( @xmath98 ) and continuing in the fully adiabatic regime . in 3d , the self - trapping events occur at @xmath99 . while , in one dimension , the curve connecting the inflection points in the adiabatic regime is a monotonic growing function of the _ e - ph _ coupling , in two and three dimensions we find distinctive parabola - like curves whose minima ( of order @xmath100 times the bare band mass ) are located at larger @xmath58 in higher @xmath52 .",
    "hence small polaron formation is favoured in low @xmath52 whereas very large _ e - ph _ couplings are required to shrink the size of adiabatic polarons in 3d .",
    "as intermolecular forces play a stronger role in more closely packed structures , lattice dimensionality is expected to shape the polaron behavior .",
    "infact , our results show that the crossover from large to small polarons is , in 2d and even more in 3d , smoother than in the case of the 1d adiabatic polaron at a fixed value of intermolecular energy",
    ". pointed out the quantitative differences in the polaron mass according to the dimensionality one should however notice a qualitative similarity in all dimensions regarding the occurence of the self - trapping event .",
    "finally we observe that , although polaron masses become generally lighter in higher @xmath52 , also in 1d the _ effective mass over bare band mass _ ratio is @xmath100 at the crossover when phonons and electrons compete on the energy scale .",
    "small polarons having mobility properties may be therefore expected in low dimensional molecular systems with sufficiently strong intermolecular forces .",
