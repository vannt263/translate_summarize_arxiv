    "plasma is a ubiquitous form of matter in the universe , nearly always found to be magnetized and turbulent . in a wide variety of space and astrophysical plasmas ,",
    "the dissipation of turbulent fluctuations makes a significant contribution to the thermodynamic heating of the plasma , requiring an understanding of this behavior to interpret a large body of astronomical observations .",
    "recently , there has been much vigorous activity in the study of turbulent heating in a wide variety of systems , including galaxy clusters @xcite , the interstellar medium @xcite , accretion disks @xcite , molecular clouds @xcite , the solar corona @xcite , the solar wind @xcite , and the magnetospheres of the earth @xcite and of other planets @xcite .    for many of these plasma environments ,",
    "the dissipation of turbulent fluctuations occurs at length scales , in the direction parallel to the local mean magnetic field , that are small compared to the particle mean free paths .",
    "the resulting weakly collisional dynamics then requires a kinetic description @xcite , with the dissipation occurring via collisionless wave - particle interactions @xcite .",
    "these kinetic damping mechanisms generally transfer energy to the plasma ions and electrons at different rates .",
    "the time scale for the collisional equilibration of temperature between species is often long , allowing the plasma ions and electrons to maintain distinct heating rates and temperatures .",
    "the radiation emitted from the hot , magnetized plasma will often depend strongly on the nature of the turbulent plasma heating , exerting a dominant influence on the observational signature of the object .    until very recently ,",
    "the question of differential heating of the ions and electrons by plasma turbulence had not been widely considered , with the exception of a pioneering series of papers by quataert and gruzinov @xcite .",
    "the need for an accurate description of the turbulent plasma heating by kinetic mechanisms motivates the two primary aims of this letter : ( 1 ) to calculate the relative heating of ions and electrons due to the kinetic dissipation of plasma turbulence ; and ( 2 ) to provide a prescription for turbulent plasma heating that may be used as a sub - grid - scale model for heating in simulations of astrophysical plasma turbulence .",
    "the turbulent heating prescription determined in this letter is based on the @xcite model for the turbulent cascade of energy in a weakly collisional plasma . whereas that study focused on conditions relevant to turbulence in the near - earth solar wind , here we generalize to a more broad range of plasma parameters for general astrophysical applications .",
    "a brief description of the model and its underlying assumptions follows  more detailed discussion is found in @xcite .",
    "the cascade model makes three primary assumptions : ( 1 ) the kolmogorov hypothesis that the energy cascade is determined by local interactions @xcite ; ( 2 ) the turbulence maintains a state of critical balance at all scales @xcite ; and ( 3 ) the linear kinetic damping rates are applicable in the nonlinearly turbulent plasma .",
    "modern theories of mhd turbulence @xcite predict an anisotropic cascade of turbulent energy through wave vector space in a magnetized plasma . or @xmath0 are unlikely to yield significant differences in the turbulent heating ratios predicted by this model . ] the resulting state of critical balance",
    "is supported by numerical simulations @xcite and observations in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "a recent study of test particle heating in mhd turbulence supports the use of linear theory to estimate the damping and heating in a turbulent plasma @xcite .",
    "astrophysical turbulence typically supports a large inertial range at perpendicular scales larger than the ion larmor radius @xmath1 , leading to turbulent fluctuations at @xmath2 that are highly anisotropic with @xmath3 .",
    "such anisotropic fluctuations are optimally described by a low - frequency expansion of kinetic theory called gyrokinetics @xcite . in this limit",
    ", all collisionless dissipation occurs via the landau resonance , and the cyclotron resonance is negligible . limitations of the application of gyrokinetic theory in the solar wind are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "energy spectra from the first nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of alfvnic turbulence at the scale of ion larmor radius are modeled with striking agreement by the cascade model used in this letter @xcite .",
    "a key simplification of the physics in the gyrokinetic limit is that the normalized eigenfrequency of the linear , collisionless gyrokinetic dispersion relation @xcite is independent of @xmath4 , giving @xmath5 ; the same holds for the damping rate , @xmath6 .",
    "this enables the development of a one - dimensional model of the turbulent magnetic field energy ( in velocity units ) , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the energy density of the magnetic field fluctuations perpendicular to the mean field integrated over @xmath4 .",
    "the model assumes a fully ionized plasma of protons and electrons with maxwellian equilibrium velocity distributions of temperature @xmath9 ( in energy units ) .",
    "plasma thermal velocities are taken to be non - relativistic , @xmath10 .",
    "at the scales of dissipation ( of order the ion larmor radius ) , the mean magnetic field can be modeled as a straight , uniform field of magnitude @xmath11 .",
    "the turbulence is assumed to be sub - alfvnic , driven isotropically at a wave number @xmath12 with an amplitude satisfying the critical balance condition , and balanced ( equal alfvn wave energy fluxes in opposite directions along the magnetic field ) .",
    "the model follows the magnetic energy in the alfvnic cascade as it transitions from alfvn waves to kinetic alfvn waves at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the numerical algorithms used to calculate the linear gyrokinetic and vlasov - maxwell dispersion relations are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the continuity equation for the evolution of the magnetic energy versus perpendicular wavenumber is given by @xmath14 where the energy cascade rate is @xmath15 , the energy injection rate is @xmath16 ( non - zero only at the driving scale @xmath17 ) , and the linear kinetic damping rate is @xmath18 . assuming critical balance at all scales , the steady state solution for the energy cascade rate is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are order unity dimensionless kolmogorov constants and @xmath22 is the rate of energy input at @xmath12 .",
    "the solution of @xmath23 for parameters @xmath24 is then used , along with the linear gyrokinetic damping rates due to each species @xmath25 @xcite , to calculate the spectrum of heating by species @xmath26 . after integrating over @xmath27",
    ", we obtain the total ion - to - electron heating rate due to the kinetic dissipation of the turbulent cascade , @xmath28 , the primary scientific result of this letter . note that @xcite presented a similar model to estimate the fraction of electron heating for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but did not account for the transition to a kinetic alfvn wave cascade at the scale of the ion larmor radius @xmath31 .",
    "first , the cascade at weakly collisional scales with @xmath32 is assumed to consist entirely of alfvnic fluctuations with alfvn mach number less than unity .",
    "the energy in compressive modes , such as the collisionless manifestation of the mhd fast and slow magnetosonic waves , is neglected based on studies that demonstrate strong damping of these waves under weakly collisional conditions for some parameter regimes @xcite ; the applicability of this result over the entire range of parameters considered here merits further study , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "here we focus solely on the cascade of alfvn waves , which are incompressible to lowest order and remain undamped down to the scale of the ion larmor radius @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "if significant turbulent energy exists in the compressive wave modes , then its dissipation and the resulting plasma heating must be accounted for separately ; @xcite discusses this matter in more detail .",
    "second , the entropy increase required to achieve irreversible thermodynamic heating can only be accomplished through collisions @xcite .",
    "wave - particle interactions damp the electromagnetic fluctuations comprising the turbulence and deposit the associated energy into non - thermal features of the particle distribution function @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the action of collisions on the non - thermal distributions of a given species lead to heating of that plasma species .",
    "third , we do not explicitly account for the kinetic energy of the alfvnic fluctuations at @xmath33 .",
    "the restoring force of alfvn waves is magnetic tension , so the energy in an alfvn wave is transferred back and forth between magnetic energy and kinetic energy at the wave frequency ; for an ensemble of many alfvn waves , the turbulent fluctuation energy is shared equally between magnetic and kinetic forms .",
    "as the turbulence transitions to scales @xmath2 , the ions decouple from the turbulence , causing the kinetic energy to become subdominant .",
    "it is assumed that the rapid transfer between kinetic and magnetic energy at the alfvn wave frequency enables both the kinetic and magnetic energy at scales @xmath34 to be channeled into the dominantly magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic alfvn wave regime @xmath35 .",
    "nonlinear simulations of kinetic turbulence will provide a crucial tool to test this assumption .",
    "the key scientific result of this letter , the calculation of ion - to - electron heating due to the kinetic dissipation of the alfvnic turbulent cascade , @xmath28 , is presented in fig",
    ".  [ fig : qiqe ] as a logarithmic contour plot over the parameter range @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the values of the kolmogorov constants used in this calculation , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are derived from a fit of the cascade model predictions to nonlinear simulations of the transition from the alfvn to the kinetic alfvn wave cascade @xcite .",
    "a salient feature of this result is that the heating rate @xmath40 is primarily a monotonic function of @xmath41 and is nearly independent of @xmath42 . @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide an in - depth discussion of various kinetic damping mechanisms and their dependence on the plasma parameters ; here we present only the key concepts necessary to explain this behavior .",
    "the ion damping peaks at @xmath13 , while the electron damping peaks at @xmath43 unless @xmath44 , a condition unlikely to be relevant to astrophysical plasmas .",
    "therefore , any energy that passes through the peak of the ion damping at @xmath45 will lead to electron heating .",
    "the damping onto ions via the landau resonance is dominated by transit - time damping involving the interaction of the ion s magnetic moment with the longitudinal magnetic field perturbation @xmath46 ( the magnetic analog of landau damping by the parallel electric field ) @xcite . as the magnetic moment of the ions increases with increasing @xmath41 , so does the strength of the transit - time damping , leading to its dominant role in controlling the ion - to - electron heating @xmath40 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 controls the scale at which the electron damping occurs , but any energy passing through the range of ion damping will ultimately heat the electrons , leading to little effect on the ratio of total damping @xmath40 .    for values of @xmath47 , the slow magnetosonic mode , often called the ion acoustic wave in this limit , is no longer heavily damped . in this case , the energy in this compressive mode may no longer be neglected .",
    "further complicating matters is the fact that the slow wave and alfvn wave may nonlinearly exchange energy at the scale of the ion larmor radius @xcite , so the ratio of ion - to - electron heating may no longer be accurately estimated using the present model .",
    "nonlinear kinetic simulations of the turbulence at the scale of the ion larmor radius will yield valuable guidance to determine the turbulent heating ratio @xmath40 in this regime .    for the gyrokinetic treatment of @xmath40 presented here to be applicable",
    ", the turbulence must be dissipated kinetically ( via the landau resonance ) before the frequencies rise to the point that the cyclotron resonance alters the dynamics . since @xmath48 in the gyrokinetic limit",
    ", this constraint may be cast as a limitation on the maximum isotropic driving wavenumber @xmath49 @xcite : for turbulence driven at wavenumbers below @xmath49 , frequencies remain sufficiently low that the cyclotron resonance never contributes and the gyrokinetic treatment is valid .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is determined using the following procedure : ( 1 ) using the critical balance condition to give @xmath50 , the maximum value of @xmath51 is determined from the steady - state solution @xmath23 ; ( 2 ) from this point ( with fixed @xmath27 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ) , the eigenfrequency using the linear vlasov - maxwell dispersion relation is solved as @xmath4 is increased until cyclotron resonant effects lead to @xmath52^{1/2 } > 0.5 $ ] ; ( 3 ) the value of the parallel wavenumber @xmath53 at this point is used to compute the corresponding @xmath49 . a logarithmic contour plot of the value of the normalized maximum isotropic driving wavenumber @xmath54 over the @xmath24 plane , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : k0 ] , enables verification of the validity of the heating results for a turbulent astrophysical plasma with given values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to provide a prescription for the turbulent heating @xmath40 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : qiqe ] that may be used as a sub - grid - scale model for heating in simulations of astrophysical plasma turbulence .",
    "the heating prescription , found by fitting the results for @xmath40 in fig .  [ fig : qiqe ] , is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "a slightly better fit for @xmath61 occurs using the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result to eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite , @xmath64^{1/2 } e^{-1/\\beta_i}$ ] , which gives the predicted value of ion - to - electron heating by transit time damping in the limit @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , @xmath66 is plotted for @xmath67 for the three methods : the cascade model calculations ( dashed ) ; the heating prescription , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) ( dotted ) ; and eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite ( solid ) .",
    "one can see that , although the estimation by @xcite generally reproduces the behavior of @xmath40 , significant deviations at @xmath68 are predicted by the cascade model calculations , and the numerical results are much more accurately described by the heating prescription given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) .",
    "we consider here the application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) to studies of astrophysical accretion disks and to the interstellar medium .",
    "recent two - fluid studies of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in accretion disks using shearing box simulations by @xcite have shown that the development of pressure anisotropies , and their saturation via kinetic instabilities , leads to substantial viscous heating , representing a direct conversion of kinetic energy due to differential rotation into heat at large scales .",
    "about 50% of the heating in the simulations occurred via this mechanism , with the ratio of ion - to - electron viscous heating given approximately by @xmath69 .",
    "numerical grid - scale dissipation accounted for the remaining 50% of the turbulent energy loss ; this loss was not added to the plasma heating because it was unclear which species should receive this energy .",
    "by applying the predicted viscous electron heating to sgr a * using a 1d model for the radiative efficiency , the observed luminosity of @xmath70  ergs  s@xmath71 implied an accretion rate of @xmath72 to @xmath73  yr@xmath71 , well below the estimated bondi accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the 50% of the energy lost numerically in their simulations represents the energy transferred to small scales via turbulence , eventually to be damped by collisionless dissipation mechanisms .",
    "here we estimate the partitioning of this heating by species using the turbulent heating model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) .",
    "the mri drives turbulence on the scale height of the disk @xcite , so we take the isotropic driving wavenumber to be @xmath74  km for sgr a*. for an ion temperature of @xmath75  k , and a magnetic field strength of @xmath76  g , the ion larmor radius is approximately @xmath77  km @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we take the plasma @xmath78 and @xmath79 , so for a value of @xmath80 , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : k0 ] that we are well below the maximum value @xmath81 required for the validity of eq .",

    "[ fig : ad ] , we compare the turbulent heating ratio @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) for @xmath82 to the viscous heating @xmath83 from @xcite .",
    "the quite surprising result is that , for a @xmath84 plasma , the two distinct mechanisms yield a heating ratio that agrees within a factor of two over the entire range of @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , adding in the plasma heating due to the damping of the turbulence via kinetic mechanisms does not change the conclusions of @xcite regarding sgr  a * discussed above .",
    "note that , in addition to the turbulent heating prescription presented here , a complete sub - grid model for turbulence would also require prescriptions for the sub - grid reynolds and maxwell stresses .",
    "the relative insensitivity of the measured stresses to the numerical resolution in the simulations of @xcite , however , suggest that the unresolved fluctuations in those simulations do not contribute substantially to the stresses . in this case , the heating prescription alone may be sufficient to determine the fate of the turbulent energy lost numerically .",
    "turbulence in the interstellar medium can be probed by interpreting the electron density fluctuations as a passive tracer mixed by the ambient turbulence .",
    "interstellar scintillation measurements of these density fluctuations in the diffuse ism demonstrate an outer scale turbulent wavenumber @xmath85  km @xcite .",
    "although the ism is an inhomogeneous plasma characterized by several different phases , it is the warm ionized component of the ism that responds to the turbulent electromagnetic fluctuations . taking typical plasma parameters of @xmath86  @xmath87 , @xmath88  k , and @xmath89  g @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath90  km and @xmath91 . for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the driving wavenumber of @xmath94",
    "easily satisfies the constraint in fig .",
    "[ fig : k0 ] . applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) , we predict an ion - to - electron heating ratio of @xmath95 due to the dissipation of turbulence in the warm ionized component of the ism . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , the predicted heating ratio is a relatively strong function of @xmath41 , so for any particular volume of plasma , the heating may vary as @xmath41 varies , but it is clear from the plot that in the range around @xmath91 neither the ions nor the electrons are dominantly heated .",
    "although there is a substantial cold , weakly ionized component of the ism , collisional coupling with the warm ions is extremely weak at the dissipative scales , so it is unlikely to affect this prediction significantly .",
