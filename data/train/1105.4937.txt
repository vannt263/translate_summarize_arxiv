    "the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory produces a new state of matter which may exceed the critical temperature @xmath1 of the phase transition from the hadron phase to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase .",
    "many phenomenological studies and lattice computations suggest that the qgp is a strongly interacting plasma @xcite , for which we can not apply the early arguments based on the perturbative approach with a small coupling constant .",
    "furthermore , the recent pb - pb heavy - ion collision experiment at lhc has created qgp matter at even higher temperatures : this shows us an obvious jet - quenching event @xcite and a larger elliptic flow @xcite compared to the rhic s au - au collision .",
    "therefore , it is indispensable for us to explore the mechanism which drives such strong interactions using a nonperturbative first - principle approach in lattice simulations .",
    "one of the most important ideas to describe a strongly interacting qgp ( sqgp ) is to focus on an infrared singularity arising from magnetic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the magnetic component of the gluon propagator is fully inaccessible by the perturbative calculation , but its infrared divergence may cause an emergence of a nonperturbative magnetic mass that plays a cutoff role and can cure thermal qcd in the infrared region .",
    "the lattice simulations @xcite prove that the magnetic gluons have a nonvanishing mass at finite temperature . furthermore , it is well known that a spatial euclidean wilson loop ( which is not extended to the temporal dimension ) bears a confining potential above @xmath1 @xcite , while the correlators of a polyakov line  wrapped in the temporal direction  give a nonconfining screened potential of the debye type , with a finite electric mass @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , from the viewpoint of the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) confinement scenario @xcite , a color - coulomb instantaneous interaction between a quark and an antiquark provides  even in the nonconfined qgp phase  a confining potential which rises linearly as the function of the quark - antiquark separation  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the thermal string tensions obtained from the spatial - wilson and the color - coulomb potentials are nonzero .",
    "they depend on the temperature and obey a magnetic scaling law [ @xmath3 . extending this line of considerations",
    ", zwanziger has approximately reconstructed the equation of state of qgp using the gribov - type dispersion relation for the massive gluons  @xcite .",
    "these interesting aspects of the non - abelian gauge theory may be related to center ( magnetic ) vortices ",
    "i.e. , to the topological defects associated with the nontrivial homotopy group @xmath4\\sim { { \\mathbb{z}}}(n)$ ]  which are responsible for certain nonperturbative phenomena of qcd .",
    "one can identify the center vortices on the lattice using a numerical technique  @xcite and also remove these vortices from the original gauge fields @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the removal of the center vortices destroys the color confinement property and restores the chiral symmetry .",
    "moreover , the lattice center - vortex density exhibits a scaling consistent with the asymptotic freedom  @xcite .    in terms of the vortex degrees of freedom ,",
    "the qcd deconfinement phase transition can be considered as a depercolation transition of the vortex lines in the direction of the euclidean time  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we can naturally understand the survival of the spatial confinement above @xmath1 because the center vortices remain intact in the spatial space .",
    "moreover , a typical center - vortex configuration is located at the gribov horizon in the gauge space .",
    "thus , the removal of the center vortices results in the dilution of the lowest eigenvalues of the faddeev - popov operator . these eigenvalues  according to the gz confinement scenario  cause confinement of color  @xcite .",
    "recently , three of us have argued that the center - vortex mechanism is also important in the hot phase of the yang - mills theory because the center vortices carry information about the magnetic degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the center vortices are related to abelian magnetic monopoles , and the later are expected to explain some of the interesting properties of the quark - gluon plasma as well  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a connection between the center vortices and the infrared properties of the gluon propagators at finite temperature . to this end",
    "we study the behavior of the electric and magnetic components of the gluon propagators by removing the vortices from the original gauge configurations and comparing the result with the original one .",
    "we use the quenched @xmath0 lattice simulations in the landau and coulomb gauges . in sec .",
    "ii we define gluon propagators on the lattice . in sec .",
    "iii a numerical technique used to make a center projection is summarized .",
    "our numerical results are presented in the sec .",
    "iv , while the last section is devoted to the summary of this work .",
    "in this study , we work in the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "the gauge potential @xmath5 is expressed via the @xmath0 matrix link variable @xmath6 as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the correlation functions of the gauge fields  ( [ gf ] ) in momentum space are @xmath9 where @xmath10(@xmath11 ) is the three - dimensional volume and @xmath12 is the euclidean time difference .    in landau - gauge fixing",
    "we study the static correlators of gluon fields with @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lattice size in the euclidean temporal direction . in the coulomb gauge , it is more appropriate to investigate an equal - time gluon propagator in the following form : @xmath16 this propagator corresponds to the one in eq .",
    "( [ cinm ] ) at @xmath17 .",
    "note that there is no @xmath18 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ cinm ] ) and that the @xmath19 term is removed from the sum .",
    "an equal - time propagator reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dispersion relation .    in the finite - temperature system ,",
    "the electric and magnetic gluons have different effects due to breaking of the euclidean lorentz invariance .",
    "one can define the spatially transverse ( @xmath22 ) and spatially longitudinal ( @xmath23 ) projection operators as follows : @xmath24 with the properties @xmath25 both spatially transverse and spatially longitudinal projectors correspond to the transverse states in momentum space : @xmath26 using these relations , the gluon propagators at finite temperature in a landau - type gauge can be separated into two independent parts : @xmath27 the electric component of the gluon propagator is given by the spatially longitudinal projection , @xmath28 and the electric mass is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the spatially transverse projection gives us the magnetic propagator @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetic mass is expected to be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a running qcd coupling defined at the scale of temperature @xmath33 .",
    "we employ a direct maximal center projection ( mcp )  @xcite in order to identify the center vortices on the lattice .",
    "the corresponding gauge is defined by the condition @xmath34",

    "if the center plaquette is not equal to a trivial element ( unity ) then a center vortex goes through this plaquette .    in order to remove the center vortices from the gauge - field ensemble",
    ", we follow ref .",
    "@xcite by multiplying the original field @xmath36 by the center - projected field @xmath37 : @xmath38 so that the new links @xmath39 correspond to vortex - free ensembles .",
    "it is confirmed by lattice simulations that the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are both lost after the removal of the center vortices  @xcite .",
    "we would also like to note that the effect of the vortex removal on chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath40sb ) depends on the choice of the lattice quark action  @xcite , and thus chiral symmetry breaking should be treated with care . in our paper",
    "we address the problem of color confinement .",
    "we carry out quenched @xmath0 lattice simulations by generating gauge configurations .",
    "the convergence criterion of the mcp technique is set as @xmath41 , and the precision of an iterative gauge fixing algorithm @xcite is @xmath42 .",
    "we use the single geometry of the lattice , @xmath43 , and various temperatures @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 [ @xmath47mev for @xmath48 for the @xmath0 gauge group ] for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we used approximately @xmath52 to @xmath53 lattice configurations collected every 100 sweep steps .      in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ g1 ] we show the gluon propagators calculated in the landau gauge at @xmath54 .",
    "the removal of center vortices visibly affects the infrared behavior of the magnetic and electric gluons in the infrared region .",
    "however , the effect of the vortex removal is much more pronounced for the magnetic degrees of freedom compared to the effect on the electric correlators .",
    "the effect of the vortex removal on the electric component of the gluon propagator diminishes with an increase of temperature , as one can see from the plots of fig .",
    "[ g1 ] , corresponding to the higher temperatures @xmath55 and @xmath46 .",
    "however , the magnetic propagators are affected drastically by the center vortices in the infrared region for all studied temperatures .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied the effects of the center ( magnetic ) vortices on electric and magnetic components of the gluon propagators in the qgp phase using @xmath0 lattice simulations in the landau and coulomb gauges .",
    "we find that the gluon dynamics in the infrared region strongly couple to the magnetic vortices .",
    "thus , in the deconfinement phase the magnetic vortex degrees of freedom should be treated nonperturbatively .    at high temperatures",
    "the removal of the magnetic vortices reduces drastically the magnetic gluon propagators in the infrared region in both gauges .",
    "the effect is similar to the suppression of the infrared gluon propagators in the confinement phase , observed first in ref .",
    "the electric propagators are almost unaffected by this procedure in the landau gauge while in the coulomb gauge  in agreement with the gz mechanism",
