    "the superfluid ring in our experiments was a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath3 @xmath4na atoms in the @xmath5 state  @xcite , at a temperature of @xmath6 nk .",
    "the toroidal optical dipole trap for the atoms was created in the same manner as reported by us previously  @xcite , using a horizontally propagating `` sheet '' beam , and a vertically propagating laguerre - gauss ( lg@xmath7 ) `` ring '' beam generated using a phase hologram  @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of both beams was @xmath8 nm , far red - detuned from the @xmath4na @xmath9 resonance at @xmath10 nm .",
    "together , these two beams created an attractive dipole trap described ( in the harmonic approximation ) by @xmath11 , \\label{eq : trap}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the atomic mass , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the trap frequency in the vertical ( radial ) direction , and @xmath15 is the radius of the ring . in this experiment",
    "the trap parameters were measured to be @xmath16 = 134(6 ) hz , @xmath17 = 550(20 ) hz , and @xmath15 = 22.6(2.3 ) @xmath2 m .",
    "the measured thomas - fermi width of the condensate in the @xmath18 ( radial ) direction was 22(2 ) @xmath2 m . using the thomas - fermi approximation",
    "we calculate the chemical potential to be @xmath19 = 2.1(2 ) khz  @xcite . with this chemical potential and the measured vertical trap frequency",
    "we calculate that the maximum vertical thickness ( thomas - fermi ) of the ring should be 5.0(1)@xmath2 m .",
    "this is roughly consistent with what we observe , given the @xmath20 @xmath2 m resolution limit of the horizontal imaging system .",
    "the repulsive barrier potential used to `` stir '' the condensate was created by a blue - detuned ( @xmath21 nm ) laser beam focused to a circular spot 9(1 ) @xmath2 m in diameter ( fwhm ) , which is smaller than the width of the annulus .",
    "the intensity and position of the beam were controlled by a two - axis acousto - optic deflector ( aod ) .",
    "stirring beam powers of up to @xmath22 @xmath2w were used in the experiment , resulting in a peak barrier potential height of @xmath23 khz .",
    "the barrier height was calibrated by measuring the density depletion of the condensate _ in situ _ as a function of laser power and position .",
    "the stated 10% uncertainty in the barrier height reflects the uncertainty in measuring the density depletion of the condensate at the location of the barrier  @xcite .",
    "the height of the barrier also varied systematically with position around the ring by @xmath24 due to the angle - dependent diffraction efficiency of the aod and angle - dependent losses in the imaging system .",
    "because of the azimuthal variation of the barrier height and the variation in condensate density around the ring , the experiment was designed so that the barrier always made at least one full revolution around the ring during the one second stirring procedure .",
    "we expect that the creation of excitations primarily occurred at the weakest point , @xmath25 where the fractional height of the barrier was largest compared to the local maximum value of the interaction energy ( the 3 oclock position in fig .",
    "[ fig : trapgeom ] ) .",
    "the comparison of our experimental results to the theory in section [ sec : theory ] assumes that this is the case .",
    "prior to stirring the condensate , we ramped on the ( stationary ) barrier beam in 100 ms to a height sufficient to stop any spuriously formed persistent currents  @xcite , then ramped the intensity back to zero in another 100 ms . with the condensate in this non - circulating state , we then stirred it with the moving barrier at constant angular velocity @xmath26 for a total duration of one second .",
    "the barrier height was ramped up ( while rotating ) from zero to a value @xmath27 in 100 ms , held at that height for 800 ms , then ramped off in another 100 ms .",
    "after this stirring procedure , we detected the presence of excitations in the condensate using a time - of - flight ( tof ) imaging procedure .",
    "the evolution of the ring condensate after release is not trivial  @xcite , but can be used to determine the circulation state of the condensate prior to release  @xcite . in the absence of any circulation the expansion of the condensate causes the central hole to close , after which the density profile typically exhibits a central peak surrounded by a broad pedestal ( fig .  [ fig : tofresults][a , d ] ) when imaged along the ( vertical ) symmetry axis of the trap .",
    "in contrast , when a condensate with some form of circulation is released , the density profile after tof expansion shows one or more holes due to the presence of phase singularities ( vortices ) in the condensate wave function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tofresults][b , c , e , f ] ) .",
    "hz , while the lower row shows results for high speeds @xmath28 hz . for sufficiently small barrier height @xmath27 ( a , d )",
    ", the condensate remains in the non - circulating state , and the density profile is peaked in the center after tof expansion , with no evidence of vortices . for higher",
    "@xmath27 the ring can be excited to a persistent current state ( b , c , e , f ) , causing a central hole to appear in the tof density profile .",
    "the size of the central hole increases with the phase winding number @xmath29 : in ( b ) @xmath30 , in ( c ) @xmath31 , and in ( e ) @xmath32 . at high @xmath26 ,",
    "the stirring may produce of off - axis vortices , as seen in ( e , f ) . at high @xmath26 and sufficiently high @xmath27 ( f ) , many vortices appear and the central hole associated with the persistent current may be distorted .",
    "the stirring conditions ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) for each image are : ( a ) 1 hz , 1080 hz ( b ) 2 hz , 930 hz ( c ) 2 hz , 1010 hz ( d ) 30 hz , 40 hz ( e ) 8 hz , 370 hz ( f ) 25 hz , 60 hz.,width=302 ]    a central hole in the density profile after tof expansion signifies the presence of a persistent current flowing around the ring .",
    "the size of the central hole depends on the phase winding number of the persistent current and the velocity of the mean - field - driven inward expansion .",
    "if we release our ring condensate by suddenly and simultaneously turning off both of the trapping beams , the hole is too small to be resolved by our imaging system for experimentally accessible tofs ( @xmath35 15 ms ) . as in our previously reported work  @xcite , we make the signature of circulation visible earlier by first adiabatically reducing the ring beam intensity by 90% over 100 ms , then releasing the condensate suddenly into ballistic expansion .",
    "we used this procedure , followed by 10 ms tof and partial - transfer  @xcite absorption imaging , to detect excitation of the superfluid ring for all the data presented here .",
    "when we follow this procedure we find that the radius of the central hole in tof increases roughly linearly with the winding number of the persistent current  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the central hole , which signifies a persistent current , in some cases we also observed off - axis holes in the density profile after tof ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tofresults][e , f ] ) , indicating the presence of vortex excitations in the annulus . while we note that there was a higher probability of observing such off - axis excitations with a barrier moving at higher angular velocities , we did not separately analyze and quantify the probability of observing them . for this experiment ,",
    "the appearance of one or more `` holes '' in the density profile of the condensate after tof was construed as evidence that the threshold for creating excitations had been exceeded .    using this criterion",
    ", we determined the probability of excitation for 10 values of @xmath26 , with @xmath33 ranging from 1 to 30 hz . for each @xmath26 ,",
    "the probability of excitation was found for a wide range of @xmath27 by conducting the experiment repeatedly at each specific value of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , then varying @xmath27 until we had mapped out a range over which the probability of excitation changed from nearly zero to nearly unity , as shown in fig .",

    ", the excitations generally occur as simple phase slips from the non - circulating state to a persistent current state with a phase winding number @xmath30 , with no indication of vortices within the annulus [ fig  [ fig : tofresults](b ) ] .",
    "as we showed previously  @xcite , in this regime the weak link created by the rotating barrier can act like a josephson junction , in that it allows quantized jumps in the persistent current state of the superfluid in the ring . while we note that the widths of our fits to the data vary as a function of @xmath26 , we believe that more data sampling and better control of experimental conditions would be required to draw any detailed conclusions about these widths .    at higher @xmath26 the response of the condensate can become more complex .",
    "excitations appear for much smaller barrier heights , but in this case we more frequently observe vortices within the annulus [ fig .  [",

    "when phase slips to different persistent current states did occur , it was almost always to states with winding number @xmath29=1 or 2 , even when the angular velocity was much higher than the rotation rate associated with one quantum of circulation in the ring @xmath40 = 0.86 hz .",
    "transitions to higher circulation states ( @xmath41 ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tofresults](e ) ] typically only occurred when the barrier height was well above the critical barrier height .",
    "when the first excitation occurs , the fact that the system does not necessarily relax to the global state of lowest energy ( in the rotating frame ) , but instead typically settles into the first energy minimum where the flow velocity through the barrier is less than the critical velocity may indicate that the phase slip dynamics in this system are strongly damped  @xcite .",

    "we assume that in our experiment the temperature ( @xmath42 nk ) is close enough to zero that the condensate can be described accurately by the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the smallest features of the trapping potential in our experiment are large compared to the condensate healing length ( @xmath43 0.3 @xmath2 m ) , allowing us to make the local density approximation , and treat the condensate as locally homogeneous .",
    "the condensate in our experiments interacts with a smoothly varying ( not hard - walled ) optical dipole potential that we approximate as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is given by eq .  ,",

    "finally , the difference between the experiment and theory in this regime could also be due to the fact that we only detect long - lived topological excitations such as vortices and persistent currents , and are not sensitive to other dissipative excitations such as surface waves .",
    "complementary detection techniques such as temperature measurements after the stirring process  @xcite , or in - situ detection of surface waves and phononic excitations  @xcite may help to distinguish between the role of these different dynamical mechanisms .",

    "<S> this experiment was conducted by creating a ring - shaped condensate in a non - circulating state , then stirring it for one second with a small ( diameter less than the width of the annulus ) repulsive potential ( created by a focused blue - detuned laser beam ) moving azimuthally at a fixed angular velocity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trapgeom ] ) . repeating this procedure many times for various combinations of potential barrier height and angular velocity , </S>",
    "<S> we have determined how the threshold for creation of such long - lived excitations depends on these experimental parameters .    in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : expt ] of this paper , we describe the experiment in detail , and report our observations of the threshold for creating excitations in the ring . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : theory ] we present a 1d hydrodynamic model of our ring condensate , which incorporates elements from the work of watanabe et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and fedichev and shlyapnikov  @xcite . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : discussion ] we then compare our data to the model s prediction of the critical barrier height for a given barrier velocity . </S>"
