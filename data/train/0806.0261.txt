    "this mixed events invariant mass distribution is finally scaled to the background in the real events distribution outside the or peak , subtracted from this real event invariant mass distribution , and finally the peak is integrated .",
    "these raw yields are then corrected for different effects to obtain the physical particle spectra .",
