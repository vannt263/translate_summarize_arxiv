    "photonics is emerging as a popular practical platform for the exploration of parity - time ( pt)-symmetric systems characterized by balanced loss and gain and having a threshold point at which real eigenfrequencies of the system coalesce to become complex conjugates @xcite .",
    "the existence of this threshold point is essential to the unique properties of pt - structures , such as unidirectional invisibility and simultaneous lasing and absorption@xcite .",
    "this phenomena opens new avenues for the realization of practical devices such as lasers , optical memory , optical switches and logic - gates@xcite . to date",
    ", pt - symmetric structures based on bragg gratings and coupled optical systems have been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently , a pt - symmetric system based on two coupled microresonators and two fiber - taper waveguides has been experimentally demonstrated and shown to exhibit direction - dependent behavior at a record low power of 1@xmath1w @xcite .",
    "this is primarily attributed to strong field localization and build up of energy in the resonant whispering gallery modes@xcite , and has further strengthened the argument for using resonant structures rather than waveguides as building blocks of pt - symmetric systems .",
    "in contrast to pt symmetric coupled waveguide systems where the eigenmodes are purely real below the threshold point , the pt symmetric coupled microresonators have complex eigenfrequencies below the threshold point due to inherent radiation losses@xcite .    in this paper we investigate the fundamental properties of the pt resonant system based on two coupled whispering gallery resonators within the context of both realistic material properties and practical operating constraints .",
    "in particular we discuss how practical dispersive properties of material gain and loss that satisfy the kramers - kronig relationship affect the performance of microcavity - based pt resonant structures .",
    "our surprising conclusion is that accounting for large , yet realistic , levels of dispersion preserves the essential threshold - behaviour predicted by completely pt - symmetric dispersionless models , while more moderate levels of dispersion can completely change the character of the response of the system to increasing gain and loss .",
    "in particular , when there is moderate dispersion the gain and loss materials respond differently to frequency shifts in such a way that sharp threshold points give way to gradual changes over a range of parameters .",
    "when dispersion is increased further , the response reverts to threshold behaviour of the type seen in non - dispersive pt - symmetric systems , albeit with some breaking of detailed quantitative symmetry .",
    "our recent work on dispersive pt - bragg gratings has shown that material dispersion limits the unidirectional invisibility to a single frequency which is in stark contrast to previous results that assumed idealized gain / loss profile in order to demonstrate wideband unidirectional behavior@xcite . in this paper , the performance of the microresonator - based pt system is analyzed for practical scenarios involving : a ) frequency mismatch between the cavity resonant frequency and the gain pump frequency and , b ) imperfect balance of the gain and loss in the system .",
    "the analysis of the microresonator - based pt system is achieved using an exact representation of the problem based on boundary integral equations and explicit analytical results are given for a weakly coupled system using perturbation analysis@xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the weakly - coupled limit in our detailed calculations because that captures the essential properties of the threshold behavior of the pt - symmetry while allowing simple analytical calculations to be used .",
    "finally , real - time field evolution in a two microresonator pt - symmetric system is analyzed for different levels of dispersion using the numerical time domain transmission line modelling ( tlm ) method@xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the theoretical background of a pt - symmetric system based on two coupled microresonators .",

    "both resonators are assumed to be surrounded by air .     and",
    "@xmath10 , respectively . ]    the refractive index of dispersive materials is frequency dependent but must also satisfy the causality property between the real and imaginary parts of the material refractive index@xcite .",

    "we now provide an analysis of coupling between resonators based on boundary integral methods .",
    "this approach is particularly suited to perturbative approximation of the coupling strength in the weak coupling limit but also provides an efficient platform for exact calculation when coupling is strong .",
    "the calculation is based on an approach used in@xcite to describe coupling between fully bound states in coupled resonators and optical fibers , but adapted here to allow for radiation losses .",
    "it is also similar to methods used in@xcite .",
    "we assume resonators of radius @xmath2 , uniform refractive index and tm boundary conditions . then the mode taking the form @xmath22 inside the isolated lossy resonator is such that the solution and its normal derivative on the boundary of the resonator can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is the free - space wave number and @xmath26 and @xmath27 being defined similarly for the gain resonator .",

    "we have included an overall factor of @xmath63 in these equations to emphasise an approximate pt - symmetry that occurs when @xmath64 .",
    "then , in the limit of high-@xmath65 whispering gallery resonances for which we may approximate @xmath66 the matrices in ( [ sys2 ] ) satisfy the conditions @xmath67 which are a manifestation of pt symmetry of the system as a whole : deviation from these conditions is due to radiation losses .",
    "the system of equations ( [ sys2 ] ) can be used as the basis of an efficient numerical method for determining the resonances of the coupled system with arbitrary accuracy . in practice ,",
    "once the gap @xmath68 between the resonators is wavelength - sized or larger , a truncation of the full system to a relatively small number of modes suffices to describe the full solution .    in the limit of very weak coupling",
    "we may achieve an effective perturbative approximation by restricting our calculation to a single mode in each resonator .",
    "we consider in particular the case of near left - right symmetry in which @xmath69 pt symmetry is achieved by further imposing @xmath64 , but for now we allow for the effects of dispersion by not assuming that this is the case .",
    "we build the full solution around modes for which @xmath70 where @xmath26 and @xmath71 are the solutions of the isolated resonators described at the beginning of this section .",

    "in the paper the impact of material dispersion on pt - symmetric coupled microresonators has been analyzed .",
    "it has been shown that the practical case of high dispersion preserves the requirement for a pt structure .",
    "however our results shows that this is only the case when the material atomic frequency is aligned with the resonant frequency of the microresonator .",
    "this comes as a direct consequence of the kramers - kronig relationship which implies that changes in the imaginary part of the refrective index caused the real part of the refractive index to change too .",
    "in addition , we also demonstrate the principle of loss - induced lasing mechanism which is triggered by an early pt - symmetry breaking",
    ". real - time operation of pt - coupled microresonators verifies that the dispersion due to the kramers - kronig relationship limits the operation of pt - coupled microresonators to a single frequency and hence forbids multi - mode pt - symmetry breaking ."
