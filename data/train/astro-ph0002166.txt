    "the x - ray - bright 50 ms pulsar  was discovered in the n158a nebula of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and has long been compared to the crab pulsar ( seward , harnden , & helfand 1984 ) . based on its timing and spectral properties ,",
    "the two rotation powered pulsars are very similar with a spin period of 50 vs. 33 ms and a spin - down rate of @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 s / s for  and the crab , respectively . from these quantities , assuming the standard magnetic dipole pulsar model , one can infer a characteristic age ( 1.7 vs. 1.2 kyr ) , spin - down energy ( @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 ) , and surface magnetic field strength ( @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 g ) for  and the crab , respectively .",
    "this similarity suggests that  could be accompanied by a `` plerion '' , a pulsar driven wind nebula ( weiler & sramek 1988 ) , reminiscent of that seen for the crab .",
    "indeed , there are several lines of evidence indicating the presence of a plerion in the vicinity of .",
    "chanan , helfand , & reynolds ( 1984 ) detected a polarized optical nebula of half - power diameter @xmath7 around the pulsar .",
    "this apparent synchrotron nebula was also resolved ( though barely ) in a radio image presented by manchester et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and in a  high resolution imager observation by seward & harnden ( 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , the overall x - ray spectrum of  and its remnant ( ) is well characterized by a power law , as expected if the emission is predominantly non - thermal ( clark et al .",
    "1982 ; wang & gotthelf 1998a ) .",
    "the  observation also revealed a faint x - ray emitting shell , @xmath8  pc in size surrounding the pulsar .",
    "this shell contributes less than @xmath9 to the total luminosity of @xmath10 in the  0.1 - 2  kev band and is likely the snr associated with the pulsar ( seward & harden 1994 ) .",
    "however , no evidence has yet been found for a similar x - ray - emitting shell or a shell - like snr around the crab ( e.g. see discussion in jones et al . 1998 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we report new results on  based on a recent observation acquired with the  high resolution camera .",
    "this observation enables us for the first time to distinguish morphological details of the nebula around .",
    "we analyze phase dependent images and resolve the expected plerion - like nebula from the point - like pulsar emission .",
    "this allows us to identify features similar to those seen from the crab nebula ; we present morphological evidence for a torus of x - ray emission , which most likely represents shocked pulsar wind materials and a likely x - ray jet emanating from the pulsar .",
    "we discuss the implications of the results in the context of the pulsar - nebula system . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a distance of @xmath11  kpc for the lmc .",
    "the  observatory ( weisskopf et al . 1996 ) observed  on aug 31 1999 as part of the initial calibration of the high resolution camera ( hrc ; murray et al .",
    "a total of 19.4 ksec of data were collected during a portion of the orbit which avoided regions of high background contamination such as from bright earth and radiation belt passages .",
    "the remnant was centered on the on - axis position of the hrc where the point - spread function ( psf ) has a half power radius ( the radius enclosing 50% of total source counts ) of @xmath12 .",
    "time - tagged photons were acquired with 15.6 @xmath13s precision , and the arrival times were corrected to the solar system barycenter using a beta version of axbary available from the  x - ray center ftp site ( a. rots 1999 , private communication ) . while the detector is sensitive to x - rays over a @xmath14 kev range , there is essentially no energy information available .",
    "we analyzed event data calibrated by the initial processing and dated 1999 september 12 , which was made available through the  public archive .",
    "in addition to the standard processing , the event data was further filtered to reduce the instrumental background and to remove `` ghost image '' artifacts using a beta version of hrc_screen ( s. murray 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "we extracted @xmath15 pixel images centered on the pulsar rebinned by a factor of two from the native hrc pixel size of 013175 per side .",
    "a global view of n158a and its environment as seen by the hrc is shown in figure  @xmath16 ( contours ) and figure  @xmath17 ( greyscale ) .",
    "the large - scale x - ray enhancement on scales up to @xmath18 is the previously resolved shell - like emission ( seward & harnden 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , the x - ray and radio emission together outlines a nearly circular morphology around .",
    "clearly , the shell represents the blastwave of .",
    "the x - ray intensity distribution within the remnant appears rather patchy .",
    "while the southwest x - ray enhancement is a good tracer of the radio and optical emission peaks , there is no general correlation between fainter radio and x - ray features .",
    "the superb spatial resolution of the  observation further allows for a close - up of the immediate vicinity of  ( fig .",
    "@xmath19 ) .",
    "the presence of a diffuse plerion - like nebula around the pulsar is apparent .",
    "to decompose the nebula emission from the pulsar contribution , we conducted phase - resolved image analysis .",
    "this enables us to estimate the local psf based on the pulsed , point - like emission from the pulsar and to quantify the extended , unpulsed nebula radiation .",
    "first , we must determine the pulse period at the current epoch .",
    "we constructed a periodigram around a narrow range of periods centered on the expected period @xmath20 ms , sampled in increments of @xmath21 , were @xmath22 is the observation duration , and @xmath23 is the test period . for each trial period , we folded photons extracted from a 10 aperture centered on the bootstrapped pulsar position ( see below ) into 20 phase bins and computed the @xmath24 of the resultant profile .",
    "we find a highly significant signal ( @xmath25 ) at @xmath26 ms at epoch 51421.630741 mjd ; the uncertainty is estimated according to the method of leahy ( 1987 ) .",
    "we have assumed a period derivative of @xmath27 for the data epoch ( deeter et al .",
    "1999 ) . in figure",
    "@xmath28 we display the resultant light - curve folded at the peak period which , as expected , is roughly sinusoidal and modulated with a @xmath29 pulse fraction ( defined as the amplitude divided by the mean ) .",
    "next , we defined two regions in the phase space , on- and off - pulse , by selecting eight adjacent phase bins corresponding to the peak and trough of the pulse profile .",
    "the on - pulse image with the off - pulse image subtracted is presented in figure  @xmath30 .",
    "this image reproduced the expected psf with no evidence of asymmetric deviations , as might be caused by poor aspect reconstruction , like that typically found for  images .",
    "figure  @xmath31 presents average radial intensity distributions around the centroid of the point - like source .    by subtracting the normalized pulsar image ( fig .",
    "@xmath30 ) , we are able to construct an image of the nebula emission ( fig .",
    "@xmath32 ) alone .",
    "the subtracted image is scaled to compensated for both the relative phase coverage and for a 21% unpulsed emission contribution , estimated by minimize a pointlike contribution at the pulsar position of the nebula image . as shown in figure  @xmath32 ,",
    "the extended emission is distinctly different from the pointlike image of the pulsed emission from the pulsar .",
    "the primarily feature is the ne - sw elongated feature , which is morphologically symmetric relative to the pulsar and extends about @xmath33 on both sides of the pulsar .",
    "however , the observed emission on the sw side appears twice as strong compared to the ne side , with an average intensity of @xmath34 .",
    "because the central core of the distribution is significantly brighter than the extended features and the subtraction of the pulsar contribution is somewhat arbitrary , the exact intensity distribution is uncertain .    there is also marginal evidence for a jet - like feature emanating from the pulsar .",
    "this emission , most apparent in the nw and extending about @xmath35 , is nearly perpendicular to the ne - sw elongated nebula and is slightly bent toward north .",
    "the integrated emission of the jet - like feature is roughly @xmath36 .",
    "the configuration of the jet feature relative to the nebula is remarkably similar to that of the crab nebula as seen by rosat and which is now clearly resolved with chandra ( see chandra publicity photo ) .    in short",
    ", the x - ray emission can be decomposed into three major morphological components : a point - like source , the surrounding nebula which shows evidence for a jet feature , and a patchy supernova remnant shell .",
    "lcc pulsar@xmath37 & & pulsed & 0.14 & point - like unpulsed & 0.18 &  nebula & 0.8 & @xmath38 ne - sw jet & 0.03 & @xmath35 long se - nw snr shell & 0.2 & @xmath39 diameter",
    "a comparison between the x - ray - emitting nebula around and the crab nebula ( see chandra publicity photo ) is very informative .",
    "the crab nebula image shows a torus of x - ray - emitting loops , which most likely represents shocked pulsar wind materials consisting of magnetic waves and ultra - relativistic particles . also clear are the two jets of x - ray - emitting material emanating from the crab pulsar , in the direction perpendicular to the major axis of the torus .",
    "we speculate that the nebula around  has a similar structure .",
    "in fact , at the spatial resolution of chandra at the lmc , the size , morphology , and surface intensity of the two nebulae are all remarkably similar ( fig .",
    "@xmath19 ) .    assuming a power law spectrum for the x - ray emission from the  nebula of photon index 2.0 and n@xmath40 ( finley et al .",
    "1993 , wang & gotthelf 1998a ) , the conversion between the count rate and the energy flux in the standard 1.0 - 10  kev band is @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding total luminosity of the nebula is @xmath42 , which is 13% of the spin - down energy of .",
    "the fraction is again similar to that of the crab .",
    "n157b ( psr j0537@xmath436910 ) is the only other lmc snr with a detected pulsar ( 16  ms ) and also shows both an extended ( resolved by  hri ) , non - thermal nebula and a partial x - ray - emitting shell ( wang & gotthelf 1998a ; 1998b ) .",
    "the upcoming  observations will make a detailed comparison between these two young crab - like snrs possible .",

    "in particular we thank a. rots and s. murray for kindly making available their beta software .",
    "we thank u. hwang for pointing out an instrumental artifact ( `` ghost image '' ) in the original hrc image of snr b0540 - 69 .",
