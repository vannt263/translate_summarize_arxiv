    "the casimir effect is regarded as one of the most striking manifestation of vacuum fluctuations in quantum field theory .",

    "in particular , vacuum forces arise acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of these forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold and its dimensionality , the boundary geometries and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field .",
    "since the original work by casimir in 1948 @xcite many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many different approaches have been used : mode summation method with combination of the zeta function regularization technique , green function formalism , multiple scattering expansions , heat - kernel series , etc .",
    "the casimir effect can be viewed as a polarization of vacuum by boundary conditions .",
    "another type of vacuum polarization arises in the case of external gravitational fields @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have studied an example of a situation when both types of sources for the polarization are present .",
    "namely , we have investigated the vacuum expectation values of the square of a scalar field and energy - momentum tensor induced by a spherical shell in the spacetime of a point - like global monopole .",

    "we study the general case of robin boundary conditions with different coefficients for the inner and outer spheres .",
    "the robin boundary conditions are an extension of the ones imposed on perfectly conducting boundaries and may , in some geometries , be useful for depicting the finite penetration of the field into the boundary with the `` skin - depth '' parameter related to the robin coefficient @xcite .",

    "mixed boundary conditions naturally arise for scalar and fermion bulk fields in the randall - sundrum model @xcite . in this model",
    "the bulk geometry is a slice of anti - de sitter space and the corresponding robin coefficient is related to the curvature scale of this space . for scalars with general curvature coupling the essential point is the relation between the mode sum energy , evaluated as a renormalized sum of the zero - point energies for each normal mode of frequency , and the volume integral of the renormalized energy density . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that in the discussion of this question for the robin parallel plates it is necessary to include in the energy a surface term concentrated on the boundary ( see @xcite for similar issues in more complicated geometries and the discussion of the paper @xcite in @xcite ) .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive a formula for the wightman function in the region between two spheres .",
