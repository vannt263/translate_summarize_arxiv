    "the recently identified x - ray flashes ( kippen et al , 2002 ) have non thermal spectra with @xmath0 kev and weak gamma - ray fluxes ( @xmath1 ph.@xmath2.s@xmath3 in the 50  300 kev energy range ) .",
    "they were discovered by beppo - sax and are currently observed by hete 2 .",
    "they can be normal grbs at very high redshifts ( which however does not seem compatible with their duration distribution similar to that of long bursts ) or viewed off - axis ( yamasaki et al , 2002 ) but their soft spectra can also have an intrinsic origin .",
    "we have tested this possibility in the context of the internal shock model where it is supposed that a central engine generates a relativistic wind with a non uniform distribution of the lorentz factor .",
    "the evolution of this relativistic wind should be followed with a fully hydrodynamical calculation .",
    "this can be done ( daigne and mochkovitch , 2000 ) but requires large amounts of computing time which prevents to consider a large number of cases and fully explore the parameter space .",
    "these detailed calculations have however shown that a simplified approach where the wind is represented by many shells which interact by direct collisions only ( all pressure waves being neglected ) can also produce satisfactory results ( kobayashi , piran and sari , 1997 ; daigne and mochkovitch , 1998 ) .",
    "going a step further we have developed for this study a toy model where internal shocks are limited to the collision of two shells of equal mass @xmath4 .",
    "shell 2 ( lorentz factor @xmath5 ) is generated a time @xmath6 after shell 1 ( lorentz factor @xmath7 ) .",
    "the average power injected into the wind in this two shell approximation is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the average mass loss rate and lorentz factor .",
    "shell 2 will catch up with shell 1 at the shock radius @xmath11 .",
    "the two shells merge and the energy dissipated in the collision @xmath12 is radiated with a characteristic broken power law spectrum .",
    "if the synchrotron process is responsible for the emission , the peak energy ( maximum of @xmath13 ) is @xmath14 in the last term @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the typical density and dissipated energy ( per unit mass ) in the comoving frame of the shocked material .",
    "the standard equipartition assumptions correspond to @xmath17 and @xmath18 but we consider below the possibility that @xmath19 and @xmath20 can have different values .",
    "this may be for example the case if the equipartition parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 which fix the fraction of dissipated energy injected into the magnetic field and the relativistic electrons are not constant but depend on @xmath15 or / and @xmath16 .",
    "the physical properties of the shocked material @xmath23 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be directly related to the wind parameters @xmath6 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 so that eq.(2 ) can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an increasing function of @xmath29 for all reasonable values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in spite of the simplicity of the two shell approximation eq.(3 ) predicts a duration - hardness relation and a hardness - intensity correlation ( hic ) as observed in real bursts .",
    "another interesting ( and surprising ) consequence of eq.(3 ) is that @xmath30 is a decreasing function of @xmath31 as long as @xmath32 . .",
    "soft bursts are obtained with `` clean fireballs '' ( large @xmath33 ) while winds with larger baryon loads ( `` dirty fireballs '' ) lead to a harder spectrum because internal shocks occur closer to the source at a higher density .    from the values of @xmath12 , @xmath6 , @xmath34 and assuming a band spectrum with low and high energy indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 it is possible to estimate ( for a given redshift ) the average flux or count rate in any spectral band .",
    "the simplicity of the two shell approximation then allows to construct a large number of synthetic bursts to check if xrfs can be formed for some specific choice of the wind parameters .",
    "the redshift @xmath37 and the four wind parameters @xmath6 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath29 have been obtained in a statistical way for each synthetic burst .",
    "if long grbs ( and xrfs ) are related to the explosive death of some special class of massive stars their birth rate is directly proportional to the star formation rate @xmath38 and their distribution in redshift can be deduced from @xmath39 ( porciani and madau , 2001 ) .",
    "the distribution of the observed duration @xmath40 for long bursts is log - normal with a maximum at @xmath41 s. we therefore also take a log - normal distribution for @xmath6 ( with a maximum at @xmath42 s ) assuming an average burst redshift @xmath43 .",
    "the last three wind parameters @xmath44 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 are very poorly constrained and we adopt for them uniform distributions : between 50 and 53 for @xmath45 , 100 and 500 for @xmath33 , 0 and 1 for @xmath46 .",
    "we performed a first numerical experiment with @xmath47 synthetic bursts to obtain their @xmath30 distribution .",
    "the results are shown in fig.1 for two choices of @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath17 and @xmath18 i.e. synchrotron emission with standard equipartition assumptions and @xmath48 .",
    "this last case was already considered by daigne and mochkovitch ( 2003 ) who have shown that it leads to very good fits of the temporal and spectral properties of individual grb pulses .",
    "the dashed line in fig.1 represents the distribution of @xmath30 for all @xmath47 bursts while the full line corresponds to the sub - group of bursts which would have been detected by batse ( a threshold of 0.2 ph.@xmath2.s@xmath3 in the 50  300 kev energy band was assumed ) .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath17 and @xmath18 the distribution of @xmath30 is much too wide while the agreement with the observations is excellent for @xmath48 .",
    "figure 1 also shows that a large fraction of events with @xmath49 kev is not detected by batse but may contribute to the population of xrfs seen by beppo - sax and hete 2 .    to test this possibility",
    "we have generated ( assuming @xmath48 ) 1000 events for which we compute both @xmath30 and the photon flux in the 50  300 kev band .",
    "the results are compared to the batse + beppo - sax data ( kippen et al , 2002 ) in fig.2 .",
    "small dots represent batse bursts while large dots are events which are not detected by batse but have an x - ray flux ( 2  10 kev ) larger than 1 ph.@xmath2.s@xmath3 .",
    "the similarity between the two diagrams clearly shows that xrfs can be produced in the context of the internal shock model .",
    "we then obtained the distributions of @xmath37 , @xmath6 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath29 for synthetic xrfs .",
    "their redshift distribution is nearly identical to that of grbs and our simulation therefore confirms that xrfs are not grbs at very high redshifts .",
    "the duration and injected power distributions are also not very different between xrfs and grbs and it finally appears that a reduction of the contrast @xmath26 and an increase of the average lorentz factor @xmath25 are the most efficient ways to produce xrfs .",
    "the distribution of @xmath29 has a sharp maximum at about 1.5 in xrfs while it steadily increases ( and is negligible for @xmath50 ) in grbs .",
    "there are also five times more xrfs with @xmath51 than with @xmath52 .",
    "our simulations have shown that xrfs can be produced by internal shocks if the lorentz factor in the relativistic wind has variations of small amplitude only and a high average value .",
    "xrfs are not the result of a low injected power @xmath44 but are weak and soft mainly due to a small contrast of the lorentz factor which leads to a reduced efficiency of the dissipation in shocks .",
