    "@xcite , both the scalar and vector lq scenarios could explain the anomalies observed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays and , for each scenario , there exist two best - fit solutions for the operator coefficients , because the other two solutions for scalar lq are already excluded by the @xmath137 decay  @xcite . to further explore these two interesting scenarios , in this paper , we have studies their effects in the semi - leptonic @xmath2 decay , which is induced by the same quark - level transition as in @xmath0 decays . besides the branching fraction @xmath3 and the ratio @xmath41 , we have also discussed the @xmath29 distributions of these two observables , as well as the @xmath5 and @xmath6 longitudinal polarizations and the lepton - side forward - backward asymmetry , using the @xmath40 transition form factors from both the qcd sum rules and the latest lattice qcd calculations .    using the best - fit solutions for the operator coefficients allowed by the current data of mesonic decays",
    ", we have found that the two lq scenarios give the similar amounts of enhancements relative to the sm predictions for the branching fraction @xmath3 and the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "the two best - fit solutions in each of the two scenarios are still found to be indistinguishable from each other based only on these two observables . on the other hand , both of the two lq scenarios give nearly the same predictions as the sm for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 longitudinal polarizations , as well as the lepton - side forward - backward asymmetry . as a consequence , we conclude that , while the two lq scenarios could be distinguished from the sm , it is quite difficult to distinguish between them using the semi - leptonic @xmath2 decay .    with the large number of @xmath31 produced at the lhc , we expect that , with future measurements of the observables in @xmath2 decay at the lhcb , the two lq scenarios could be further tested , and even differentiated from the other np explanations to the @xmath7 anomalies .",

    "<S> it has been shown that the anomalies observed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays can be resolved by adding a single scalar or vector leptoquark to the standard model , while constraints from other precision measurements in the flavour sector can be satisfied without fine - tuning . to further explore these two interesting scenarios , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study their effects in the semi - leptonic @xmath2 decay . using the best - fit solutions for the operator coefficients allowed by the current data of mesonic decays </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ( i ) the two scenarios give the similar amounts of enhancements to the branching fraction @xmath3 and the ratio @xmath4 , ( ii ) the two best - fit solutions in each of the two scenarios are also indistinguishable from each other , ( iii ) both scenarios give nearly the same predictions as the standard model for the longitudinal polarizations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as the lepton - side forward - backward asymmetry . with future measurements of these observables in @xmath2 decay at the lhcb , the two leptoquark scenarios could be further tested , and even differentiated from the other np explanations to the @xmath7 anomalies . </S>"
