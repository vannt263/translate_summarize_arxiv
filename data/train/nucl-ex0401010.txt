    "secondary processes of the produced mesons can be neglected and , simultaneously , sufficiently high luminosities are obtained . for the @xmath6 and @xmath4 measurements at the anke and cosy-11 facilities a cluster - jet target  @xcite providing areal densities of up to @xmath15  @xmath16 has been used ( with h@xmath17 or d@xmath17 as target material ) . with proton beam intensities of a few @xmath18 luminosities of @xmath19 have been achieved .",
    "the anke spectrometer  @xcite comprises three dipole magnets d1d3 which separate forward - emitted charged reaction products from the circulating cosy beam and allow one to determine their emission angles and momenta . with a gap height of @xmath20  cm , the spectrometer dipole d2 provides a large angular acceptance of up to @xmath21 vertically and @xmath22 horizontally , which is particularly advantageous for correlation measurements with threshold kinematics .",
    "the layout of anke , including detectors and the daq system , has been optimized and used to study @xmath3-spectra from @xmath23 collisions at beam energies down to @xmath24  gev ( @xmath25  gev / c )  @xcite , thus far below the free nucleon - nucleon threshold at @xmath26  gev .",
    "this is a very challenging task because of the small @xmath3-production cross sections , _",

    "is being used with a size of typically a few mm@xmath35 .",
    "the diameter of the electron cooled and stochastically extracted beam can be less than 2  mm with a very small beam halo , while the momentum spread @xmath36 is less than @xmath37 .",
    "the small interaction region permits to install vertex counters very close to the interaction point for precise track reconstruction of charged ejectiles .",
    "the external experiment cosy - tof  @xcite is a wide angle , non magnetic spectrometer with various start and stop detector components for time - of - flight measurements , combining high efficiency and acceptance with a moderate energy and momentum resolution .",
    "the system allows one to completely reconstruct the 4-vectors of all final particles from @xmath1 events including the determination of the delayed decay vertices of @xmath38- and @xmath39- hyperons as well of the @xmath40 .",
    "associated strangeness production has been measured in the reactions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 at beam momenta between 2.5 and 3.3 gev / c ( sect .  [ sec : associated ] ) .",

    "@xcite are presently being developed .",
    "investigation of associated strangeness production close to threshold may provide insight into the dynamics of the production processes , _",
    "e.g. _ the role of @xmath48-resonances or the effect of hyperon - nucleon final - state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "total @xmath49 cross sections from cosy-11  @xcite and cosy - tof  @xcite at excitation energies @xmath50  mev have been described within various approaches , _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath14-@xmath51 exchange models of laget  @xcite and sibirtsev  @xcite as well as resonance - model calculations of dillig  @xcite , tsushima  @xcite and shyam  @xcite . in order to discriminate between these models precise data , covering full phase space ,",
    "are needed for different isospin channels .",
    "spin observables should also be measured , in particular the polarization of the hyperon , which can be extracted via its self - analyzing weak decay .",
    "dalitz plot analyses of data from cosy - tof are a powerful tool to investigate strangeness - production mechanisms .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tof_pklambda ] where the data  @xcite are compared with calculations performed with a model of sibirtsev  @xcite , in which contributions from non - resonant meson exchanges are included coherently with those from the @xmath48(1650 , 1710 , 1720)-resonances and the @xmath52-fsi .",
    "the strength of each effect can be adjusted separately to find the best agreement between data and model .",
    "whereas at 2.85 gev / c only the @xmath48(1650 ) is relevant ( not shown here ) , a significant contribution from the @xmath48(1710 ) is needed at 2.95 gev / c . at 3.20 gev",
    "/ c the amplitudes of both resonances are equal within the precision of the analysis , and at 3.30 gev / c the @xmath48(1710 ) becomes dominant .",
    "since the excitation of @xmath48-resonances can only follow an exchange of a non - strange meson , it can be concluded that there is no dominant kaon exchange contributing to the reaction .",
    "note that even at 3.30 gev / c the @xmath52-fsi has a significant influence on particular regions of the measured dalitz plots .    as a next step hyperon production in @xmath4-reactions will be studied at cosy - tof .",
    "first test measurements showed that events of the type @xmath53 can be identified ( first results from anke on the reaction @xmath54 are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : pn ] ) .",
    "moreover , the use of a polarized beam will allow one to extract polarization observables . in this context",
    "a special motivation comes from the disto experiment where in the reaction @xmath55 the polarization transfer coefficient @xmath56 has been measured to be strongly negative  @xcite , pointing at a @xmath14-exchange dominance  @xcite .",
    "cosy - tof allows one to study this quantity closer to threshold with full phase - space coverage .",
    "although of very high interest , at present little is known about the strength of the hyperon - nucleon interaction ( parameterized by the scattering length ) at small energies not to speak of its spin dependence .",
    "the problem is due to the fact that it is practically impossible to perform low energy scattering experiments with unstable particles .",
    "thus , in order to determine the scattering length of this reaction one has to rely on extrapolations from the data to threshold . a detailed analysis of the world data set for elastic @xmath57 scattering gave @xmath58 for the spin - singlet and spin - triplet scattering lengths , respectively , where the errors are strongly correlated  @xcite .",
    "an alternative are production experiments with a hyperon - nucleon pair in the final state .",
    "then , the scattering parameters are to be determined from the impact of their fsi on the invariant mass spectra . in ref .",
    "@xcite a method has been proposed that allows one to extract the scattering lengths from the production data directly . in particular ,",
    "an integral representation for the @xmath59 scattering lengths in terms of a differential cross section of reactions with large momentum transfer such as @xmath60 or @xmath61 has been derived .",
    "this formula should enable the determination of the scattering lengths to a theoretical uncertainty of about 0.3  fm .",
    "up to date , all experiments for @xmath59 production in @xmath6 collisions were performed unpolarized and thus contain contributions from both spin triplet as well as spin singlet final states with an unknown ratio .",
    "however , polarization measurements will allow one to disentangle the different spin states , as is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the corresponding experiments can be performed at cosy .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) has triggered an intensive investigation of exotic resonances ( _ i.e. _ non 3@xmath66 states ) .",
    "after the existence of @xmath7 seems to be confirmed experimentally its quantum numbers , like spin or parity , have to be determined .    at cosy",

    "an about 5@xmath76 signal in the @xmath77 invariant mass distribution has , in fact , been observed at a beam momentum of 2.95 gev / c .",
    "the very preliminary cross section estimate is of the order of a few hundred nb .",
    "the width of the peak is about 25 mev / c@xmath64 , corresponding to the experimental resolution  @xcite . at anke a proposal",
    "@xcite has been accepted to measure the reactions @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 at maximum cosy energy .",
    "these measurements will be carried out in spring 2004 .    in recent papers ,",
    "thomas _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and hanhart _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have emphasized that the parity of the @xmath7 can be determined from polarization observables of the reaction @xmath81 near the production threshold .",
    "in particular , the sign of the spin correlation coefficient @xmath82 yields the negative of the parity of the @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "such measurements can , in principle , be carried out at anke and cosy - tof .",
    "data on the @xmath3-production cross section from @xmath4 interactions in the close - to - threshold regime are not available yet .",
    "this quantity is , for example , crucial for the theoretical description of @xmath23 and @xmath83 data since it has to be used as an input parameter for corresponding model calculations .",
    "predictions for the ratio @xmath84 range from one to six , depending on the underlying model assumptions : pirou and smith  @xcite proposed that there is no difference between @xmath3 production on the neutron and proton , whereas the analysis by tsushima _",
    "et al . _  @xcite yields @xmath85 for the total production cross sections",
    "fldt and wilkin  @xcite draw an analogy between @xmath3- and @xmath86-meson production and give a ratio of six for the ratio between production on the neutron and proton .",
    "@xmath3-production in @xmath87d interactions has been measured with anke @xmath88 and 2.83 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : pd2k+x ] shows the @xmath3-momentum spectrum for the higher beam momentum . based on the assumption that the @xmath3-production cross section is governed by the sum of the elementary @xmath6 and the @xmath4",

    "@xcite ( dashed line labeled by `` @xmath90 '' ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( dash - dotted line , `` @xmath91 '' ) .",
    "the apparent difference between the calculated and measured cross sections can be due to the fact that the ratio @xmath92 differs from those given in refs .",
    "thus the simulations were also made keeping the relative weights of the individual @xmath6 and @xmath4 channels constant ( as given by ref .",
    "@xcite ) but treating the ratio of the sum of these two contributions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath93 , as a free parameter .",
    "the best agreement between data and calculations is obtained for @xmath94 at 2.60 gev / c and @xmath95 at 2.83 gev / c ( solid line in upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd2k+x ] ) .",
    "the resulting large value of @xmath93 from the inclusive spectra is supported by the analysis of missing - mass spectra from @xmath96 events collected during the same beam time .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath97 gev / c is also shown in fig.[fig : pd2k+x ] and is compared with the result of the monte - carlo simulations , again for different ratios @xmath93 . the best agreement between data and simulations",
    "is obtained for @xmath98 .",
    "a primary goal of hadronic physics is to understand the structure of mesons and baryons , their production and decays , in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the non - perturbative character of the underlying theory  quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd )  hinders straight forward calculations .",
    "qcd can be treated explicitly in the low momentum - transfer regime using lattice techniques  @xcite , which are , however , not yet in the position to make quantitative statements about light scalar states ( @xmath99 ) . alternatively , qcd inspired models , which use effective degrees of freedom , are to be used .",
    "the constituent quark model is one of the most successful in this respect ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "this approach treats the lightest scalar resonances @xmath100(980 ) as conventional @xmath101 states .",
    "however , they have also been identified with @xmath102 molecules  @xcite or compact @xmath103-@xmath104 states @xcite .",
    "it has even been suggested that at masses below 1.0 gev / c@xmath64 a full nonet of 4-quark states might exist @xcite .",
    "such possible deviations from the minimal quark model have a parallel in the baryon sector , where the above mentioned @xmath7 state requires at least five quarks .",
    "the existing data are insufficient to conclude on the structure of the light scalars and additional observables are urgently called for . in this context",
    "the charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing plays an exceptional role since it is sensitive to the overlap of the two wave functions .",
    "it should be stressed that , although predicted to be large long ago  @xcite , this mixing has not been identified unambiguously in corresponding experiments .",
    "an experimental program has been started at cosy which aims at exclusive data on @xmath100 production close to the @xmath102 threshold from @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath105  @xcite and @xmath106 @xcite interactions  i.e.  different isospin combinations in the initial state .",
    "the reactions @xmath107 and @xmath108 have been measured at cosy-11 @xcite and momo  @xcite , respectively , at excitation energies up to @xmath109  mev above the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "however , mainly due to the lack of precise angular distributions , the contribution of the @xmath100 to @xmath5 production remains unclear for these reactions .    at anke , the reaction @xmath110 has been measured exclusively ( by reconstructing the @xmath111 from the measured @xmath112 missing mass ) at beam momenta of @xmath113 and 3.65 gev / c ( @xmath114 and 103 mev ) .",
    "these measurements crucially depend on the high luminosities achievable with internal targets , the large acceptance of anke for close - to - threshold reactions , and the excellent kaon identification with the anke detectors .",
    "the obtained differential spectra for the lower beam momentum are shown in fig.[fig : pp2dkkbar ]  @xcite .",
    "the background of misidentified events in the spectra of fig.[fig : pp2dkkbar ] is less than 10% which is crucial for the partial - wave analysis .",
    "this analysis reveals that the @xmath115 pairs are mainly ( 83% ) produced in a relative @xmath116-wave ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2dkkbar ] ) , which has been interpreted in terms of dominant @xmath117-resonance production  @xcite .    data on the reaction @xmath118 have been obtained at anke in parallel to the kaon data .",
    "in contrast to the latter , where the spectra are almost background free , the @xmath119 signal is on top of a huge multi - pion background . this makes the analysis of this channel much more demanding and at present even model dependent  @xcite .",
    "a total cross section of @xmath120b has been extracted from the data with a resonant contribution of @xmath121b  @xcite .",
    "together with the cross section for the @xmath122 channel this yields a branching ratio of @xmath123 which is in reasonable agreement with model calculations @xmath124",
    "@xcite threshold strongly depends on the @xmath125 value of the reaction due to phase - space cuts at the upper edge of the mass distributions . ] for this beam momentum .",
    "this confirms the interpretation of dominant resonant @xmath126 production via the @xmath117 from above .",
    "the data at @xmath127  mev are still being analyzed .",
    "as the next step a measurement of the reaction @xmath128 at @xmath129 mev will be performed at anke in feb .",
    "the results of a similar experiment on the reaction @xmath130  demonstrating the feasibility of such measurements with a d@xmath17 target  are described in sect.[sec : pn ] . according to our cross - section estimates a measurement of the reaction",
    "@xmath131 should be feasible within few weeks of beam time and is foreseen for winter 2004/05  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results on @xmath117 production in @xmath6 interactions can also be regarded as a successful feasibility test for a long - term experimental program with the final goal to determine the charge - symmetry breaking @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing amplitude .",
    "these measurements will require the use of a photon detector which is not yet available at cosy .",
    "however , it is planned to relocate the wasa detector  @xcite from its current location at celsius / tsl to cosy in summer 2005 , which will then make these experiments feasible .",
    "both , the @xmath132- and the @xmath10-resonances can decay into @xmath133 and @xmath134 , whereas in the non - strange sector the decays are into different final states according to their isospin , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 or @xmath138 .",
    "thus , only the non - strange decay channels have defined isospin and allow one to discriminate between the two mesons .",
    "it is also only by measuring the non - strange decay channels that csb can be investigated .",
    "such measurements can be carried out with wasa at cosy for active @xmath139- or @xmath86-meson identification , while the strange decay channels @xmath140 should be measured in parallel .",
    "since it is possible to manipulate the initial isospin of purely hadronic reactions one can identify observables that vanish in the absence of csb  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the proposed experiments is the same as behind recent measurements of csb effects in the reactions @xmath141  @xcite and @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the signal from the scalar mesons is much simpler as compared to the pion case .",
    "since the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 are rather narrow overlapping resonances , the @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing in the final state is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude compared to csb in the production operator ( i.e.``direct '' csb violating @xmath143 production ) and should , e.g. , give the dominant contribution to the csb effect via the reaction chain @xmath144  @xcite .",
    "this reaction seems to be most promising for the extraction of csb effects , since the initial deuterons and the @xmath145 particle in the final state have isospin @xmath146 ( `` isospin filter '' ) .",
    "thus , any observation of @xmath147 production in this particular channel is a direct indication of csb and can give information about the @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing amplitude  @xcite .    in analogy with the measurement of csb effects in the reaction @xmath148",
    ", it has been predicted that the measurement of angular asymmetries ( i.e.  forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath149 c.m.s . ) can give information about the @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing @xcite .",
    "it was stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that  in contrast to the @xmath141 experiment where the forward - backward asymmetry was found to be as small as 0.17% @xcite  the reaction @xmath150 is subject to a kinematical enhancement . as a consequence , the effect is predicted to be significantly larger in the @xmath9/@xmath10 case .",
    "the numbers range from some 10%  @xcite to factors of a few @xcite and , thus , should easily be observable .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the analyzing power of the reaction @xmath151 also carries information about the @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing amplitude .",
    "this quantity can be measured at cosy as well .",
