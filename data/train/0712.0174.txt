    "therefore , at t@xmath6 under field cooled conditions , the diffuse scattering is reduced preferentially along directions perpendicular to the applied electric field .",
    "this feature was not obvious near @xmath15=(001 ) due to the fact that the measurements there were conducted closer to the bragg peak and therefore less sensitive to changes in the lineshape .",

    "one distinct difference between pmn and pzn is that in the latter , long range rhombohedral domains form with an external [ 111 ] field .",
    "therefore the memory effect of diffuse scattering measured in pzn and pzn-8%pt is more likely to be associated with ferroelectric domain formation and rotation .",
    "the electric field effects show that there is a direct relation between the polar correlations and the diffuse scattering .",
    "the fact that the diffuse scattering is only diminished below t@xmath6 and , in particular , very anisotropic ( being elongated strongly along one direction ) and exhibits no memory is suggestive that the diffuse scattering is directly related to the polar structure in the relaxor ferroelectrics as described in several models .",

    "the diffuse scattering is onset and is insensitive to the application of an electric field . presumably , in this temperature range",
    "the polar moments are isotropic and insensitive to the presence of a strong electric field which selects a particular direction .",

    "both the decreases in intensity and asymmetry are onset at t@xmath6 .",
    "this suggests a change in the universality class as the polar moments have a strong anisotropy implying that a discrete symmetry is dominating the ground state hamiltonian , as is the case for a cubic anisotropy term in the hamiltonian .",
    "given that the same hamiltonian must apply at all temperatures , these results show that t@xmath6 characterizes the cubic anisotropy in the hamiltonian , while t@xmath11 describes the continuous ( heisenberg ) component of the hamiltonian . therefore , pmn is a system where the energy scale of the continuous component of the hamiltonian dominates over the anisotropic component . the dominant term ( and hence the effective universality class )",

    "these results supports the claim that the distortion is limited to a small region near the surface and is not representative of the bulk properties and indicate that the near surface region is sensitive to the application of an electric field .",
    "this is in accord with previous x - ray measurements ( with a similar penetration depth to the experiments presented here ) on pmn which were conducted on 30 @xmath44 thick samples and comparable to the estimated thickness of the `` skin '' layer in our sample .",

    "@xcite    even though the presence of a surface skin having different critical properties is unusual in materials and condensed matter physics , the effect has been observed before in the case of model magnets in the presence of random fields .",

    "possible explanations of the two - length scales have been proposed and a review and discussion can be found elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting to speculate whether the presence of a skin is important ( and even necessary ) for the presence of a relaxor ground state . given the many results showing the presence of a distinct skin in relaxors , it maybe that the ferroelectric transition in these systems is driven by the surface boundary condition . whether this is the result of strain or chemical inhomogeneity at the surface is not clear and further investigation",
    "would be required to distinguish these two cases .",
    "it is interesting to note that even when the polar nanoregions are reduced by the field , a long - range ( rhombohedral ) ferroelectric phase has not been established in the bulk .",
    "however , as noted in the section discussing the diffuse scattering , the bragg peak intensity is enhanced at low temperatures as a function of field implying a more ordered structure .",
    "this occurs while the diffuse scattering is reduced under an electric field .",
    "we note that the absence of a long range ferroelectric ground state is supported by recent nmr results which show at least half of the sample remains in a disordered ground state under the application of an electric field as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we have presented a neutron and x - ray scattering study of the diffuse scattering in pmn under the application of a strong electric field .",
    "our results show that the diffuse scattering is directly associated with short - range polar order in the system .",
    "the balance between this short - range polar order and long- range atomic order in the bulk of the sample is reflected in a trade off of intensity between the diffuse and bragg scattering and is tuned with an electric field . however , for fields below 8 kv / cm , no long - ranged ferroelectric phase is formed .",
    "the absence of any hysteresis in the bulk suggests that the ground state of pmn is not a glassy state .",
    "instead , the presence of two temperature scales agrees with predictions of recent random field models proposed for relaxor systems .",

    "<S> neutron and x - ray diffraction techniques have been used to study the competing long and short - range polar order in the relaxor ferroelectric pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pmn ) under a [ 111 ] applied electric field . despite reports of a structural transition from a cubic phase to a rhombohedral phase for fields e @xmath3 1.7 kv / cm </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the bulk unit cell remains cubic ( within a sensitivity of 90@xmath4-@xmath5 = 0.03@xmath4)for fields up to 8 kv / cm . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe a structural transition confined to the near surface volume or ` skin ' of the crystal where the cubic cell is transformed to a rhombohedral unit cell at t@xmath6=210 k for e @xmath3 4 kv / cm , for which 90@xmath4-@xmath5=0.08 @xmath7 0.03@xmath4 below 50 k. while the bulk unit cell remains cubic , a suppression of the diffuse scattering and concomitant enhancement of the bragg peak intensity is observed below t@xmath6=210 k , indicating a more ordered structure with increasing electric field yet an absence of a long - range ferroelectric ground state in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the electric field strength has little effect on the diffuse scattering above t@xmath6 , however below t@xmath6 the diffuse scattering is reduced in intensity and adopts an asymmetric lineshape in reciprocal space . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of hysteresis in our neutron measurements ( on the bulk ) and the presence of two distinct temperature scales suggests that the ground state of pmn is not a frozen glassy phase as suggested by some theories but is better understood in terms of random fields introduced through the presence of structural disorder . </S>",
    "<S> based on these results , we also suggest that pmn represents an extreme example of the two - length scale problem , and that the presence of a distinct skin maybe necessary for a relaxor ground state . </S>"
