    "like cuprate superconductors , many of their iron - based cousins have an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase in the phase diagram near the superconducting phase  @xcite . as phonons are moreover not believed to be strong enough to explain the relatively high transition temperatures of pnictides  @xcite , the afm interactions have attracted large interest  @xcite .",
    "apart from the metallic character of the spin - density  wave ( sdw ) phase in pnictides  as opposed to the mott insulator in undoped cuprates  a second difference is that the sdw in pnictides breaks the four - fold symmetry of the iron - arsenic planes down to a two - fold symmetry .",
    "this breaking of the four - fold lattice symmetry is seen in the conductivity  @xcite and in angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite even at temperatures above the onset of magnetic long - range order . while there is a structural phase transition at slightly higher temperature and",
    "while the in - plane lattice constants thus break the rotational lattice symmetry  @xcite , the effects in experiments appear stronger than can be explained by slightly different lattice constants .",
    "additional symmetry - breaking of the electronic degrees of freedom has thus been suggested to be involved , especially ( i ) a breaking of the _ orbital _ symmetry , i.e. , a lifting of the degeneracy of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals  @xcite , and ( ii ) a _ nematic _ phase of the spin degree of freedom  @xcite . in the latter scenario , magnetic correlations already select the preferred ordering vector , e.g. , @xmath4 over the equivalent @xmath5 , but do not yet establish long - range magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "a related picture involves clusters with short - range magnetic order whose afm direction is pinned by the lattice anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "one problem in deciding between the scenarios is precisely that they all break the same symmetry , which implies that as soon as one of the breaks rotational symmetry , the symmetry in the other degrees of freedom will be broken as well .",
    "lattice  @xcite and orbital  @xcite degrees of freedom thus strongly interact with the spin .",
    "nevertheless , identifying the signatures of various modes of symmetry breaking may help to elucidate the most important effects .",
    "we calculate here the spectral density of the three - orbital model , see sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , where the four - fold rotational lattice symmetry is broken by ( i ) orbital order , ( ii ) anisotropic hoppings and ( iii ) short - range afm interactions . in order to be able to keep the magnetic interactions short - range and in order to include onsite coulomb interactions , we employ cluster - perturbation theory , extending an earlier study  @xcite of anisotropy driven by short - range afm and ferromagnetic ( fm ) interactions .",
    "anisotropic magnetic interactions can distort the spectral density in agreement with arpes both in otherwise noninteracting three- and four - band models and for a regime close to the sdw phase  @xcite , orbital order in the non - interacting model was discussed in  @xcite . here , we compare the two scenarios near the sdw in more detail and also compare them to symmetry breaking via anisotropic hoppings .",
    "while distortions induced by the latter can not even qualitatively be reconciled with arpes for the noninteracting model , we are going to see that results become more realistic near the sdw transition .",
    "as we want to use exact diagonalization to solve a fully interacting model on a small four - site cluster , we have to restrict the model to at most three bands .",
    "we use a variant  @xcite of the three - band model proposed in  @xcite that gives a better fit of the fermi surface .",
    "the unit cell of the fe - as plane contains two iron and two arsenic ions , however , an internal symmetry of this unit cell allows us to write the hamiltonian in terms of a one - iron unit cell  @xcite as long as we consider isolated planes , as is done here . in momentum space , the tight - binding hamiltonian can then be written in terms of a pseudo - crystal momentum @xmath6 , which is defined as @xmath7 for the @xmath2/@xmath3 orbitals and @xmath8 for the @xmath9 orbital and which is taken from the enlarged brillouin zone corresponding to a one - iron unit cell . when translating the spectral density @xmath10 from pseudo - crystal momentum @xmath6 to ` lab - space ' momentum @xmath11 , spectral weight of @xmath9 character",
    "is shifted by @xmath12 with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 weight  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-dependent hamiltonian in orbital space can then be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron with pseudo - crystal momentum @xmath6 and spin @xmath16 in orbital @xmath17 .",
    "the orbital indices @xmath18 refer to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 states of the iron @xmath19 manifold , respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 defining the hoppings are given by @xmath21 where a bar denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "hopping parameters are the same as in  @xcite : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath34 depends on the interaction terms and is chosen to fix the filling at 4 electrons per site , for non - interacting electrons , we find @xmath35 .",
    "all energies are given in ev .",
    "these bands are only an approximation and a three - band model may not be detailed enough to capture material - dependent properties .",
    "we also include the onsite coulomb interactions including hund s rule coupling and pair hopping  @xcite . while the couplings for the @xmath2/@xmath3 doublet can in principle differ from the ones involving the @xmath9 orbital , we choose them here to be the same and employ the symmetric relations @xmath36 for simplicity .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 denote the orbital and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the spin ( electronic density ) in orbital @xmath41 at site @xmath42 .",
    "the electron - spin operators are given as usual by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "we choose here @xmath45 and @xmath46 , because the system is then very close to the sdw transition .",
    "the interacting system has been found to be very susceptible to magnetic interactions breaking rotational symmetry  @xcite , and we thus concentrate on this regime .",
    "similar to the approach chosen in  @xcite , we explicitly break rotational symmetry by heisenberg couplings that act only locally within the small cluster directly solved with exact diagonalization ( see method below ) . extending the analysis in  @xcite",
    ", the coupling @xmath47 along the @xmath0-direction and @xmath48 along @xmath1 can have different magnitudes and the same or different signs : @xmath49 where @xmath34 , @xmath17 denote orbitals and @xmath50 nearest - neighbour ( nn ) bonds along the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the coupling is afm .",
    "we compare this magnetic symmetry breaking addressing the anisotropy of the magnetic state to a an orbital symmetry breaking addressing the symmetry between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the latter is implemented as a difference in onsite energy @xmath52 where @xmath53 favours occupation of the @xmath2 orbital , as proposed as an explanation of the anisotropic spectral density  @xcite . finally , as a third way to induce an anisotropy",
    ", we make hoppings along one lattice direction five to ten percent larger .",
    "following  @xcite , this hamiltonian is treated with the variational cluster approach .",
    "this method allows to include correlations within a small cluster ( 4 sites for the three - orbital model discussed here ) , which is solved almost exactly with lanczos exact diagonalization . hopping between the clusters",
    "is then included as a perturbation  @xcite .",
    "long - range order can be treated by optimizing the grand potential with respect to fictitious ordering fields  @xcite , the sdw state of a two - band model for pnictides has been studied with this approach  @xcite .",
    "in fact , all parameters of the one - particle part of the hamiltonian can in principle be optimized , we found here that optimizing an overall fictitious chemical potential is necessary near the sdw transition to obtain a stable solution .",
    "for onsite interactions near the sdw transition ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and a phenomenological field @xmath54 , see ( [ eq : oo ] ) , breaking the orbital @xmath2/@xmath3 symmetry and favouring the @xmath2 orbital .",
    "solid lines give the noninteracting bands in terms of the pseudo - crystal momentum @xmath55 ; shading gives the spectral weight of the interacting system for ` lab - space ' momentum @xmath11 , @xmath9 weight is thus shifted by @xmath12 with respect to @xmath55 . in the online colour figure , red ,",
    "blue and green shading illustrate spectral weight in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 orbitals respectively.[fig : akw_oo],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    it has been shown that both orbital ordering  @xcite and anisotropic magnetic correlations  @xcite can reproduce the band distortions in a manner broadly consistent with arpes , i.e. , the @xmath3 states at @xmath56 move to higher energies than the @xmath2 states at @xmath57 .",
    "differences between these two ways of breaking rotational lattice symmetry mostly affect states around @xmath58 , where an orbital energy splitting induces stronger distortions than the magnetic fluctuations in the absence of onsite interactions  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen by comparing figures  [ fig : akw_oo ] and  [ fig : akw_af_af ] , this remains true when onsite interactions push the system closer to the sdw transition .",
    "one may also note that despite the sizable onsite interactions , one still needs an orbital energy splitting @xmath54 to induce the band anisotropy between @xmath59 and @xmath60 as seen in figure  [ fig : akw_oo ] .",
    "the anisotropy in the final band structure is here not even extreme , with the @xmath3 states not quite reaching the fermi level , and @xmath61 of a similar order of magnitude induces comparable distortions in non - interacting bands  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to short - range magnetic couplings that become more effective at distorting the bands when onsite interactions are switched on  @xcite .",
    "onsite interactions thus enhance the tendency to short - range magnetic correlations but do not appear to strengthen tendencies to a direct orbital energy splitting in a comparable manner .",
    "we did not find spontaneous symmetry breaking between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals , which can be investigated in the variational cluster - perturbation theory  @xcite .    , but without orbital energy splitting .",
    "instead , there are anisotropic afm couplings , see ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) , acting within the directly solved four - site cluster , i.e. , on a very short distance only . @xmath62",
    "[ fig : akw_af_af],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    , but without orbital energy splitting . instead",
    ", there is a phenomenological difference in hopping parameter @xmath63 : it is @xmath64 larger along @xmath1-direction .",
    "[ fig : akw_t2],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    figure  [ fig : akw_t2 ] illustrates an alternative way to induce an anisotropy : the hopping parameter @xmath63 is chosen @xmath64 larger along the @xmath1-direction , a rather larger hopping anisotropy . for non - interacting electrons ( not shown ) , this simply increases the dispersion somewhat , but does not raise the states at @xmath60 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : akw_t2 ] , the interplay of the hopping anisotropy with onsite interactions , which favour a @xmath4 or @xmath5 sdw , distorts the bands : the @xmath3 band going from @xmath65 to @xmath59 has become very incoherent , and the only remaining coherent states at @xmath59 are above the fermi level . it should be noted that the effect of an anisotropy on various hopping parameters is not consistent : it is largest for @xmath63 , which is the larger nn hopping entering the kinetic energy of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals , see ( [ eq : ekin ] ) . @xmath64 anisotropy of the other nn hoppings @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 leads to far smaller effects ( not shown ) .    finally , we take a closer look at the short - range magnetic interactions that were shown to induce band anisotropies in  @xcite , where the strength of the afm ( along @xmath0 ) and fm ( along @xmath1 ) couplings were chosen with opposite sign , but of equal strength . by varying the two parameters independently",
    ", we found that it is not necessary to have one fm and one afm direction .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : akw_af_af ] shows a spectrum obtained for a case where both couplings are afm , but the one along @xmath0 is much stronger ( @xmath69 ) than the one along @xmath1 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the afm couplings act only within the directly solved cluster , i.e. , they favour afm bonds more along @xmath0 than along @xmath1 .",
    "the clusters are coupled within cluster - perturbation theory only via the kinetic energy , i.e. , there is no long - range magnetic order .",
    "the anisotropic signatures seen in the spectral density are comparable to those found for @xmath71  @xcite . as",
    "the order parameter for nematic order is of higher order , its spontaneous symmetry breaking can not be studied in cluster - perturbation theory .",
    "we investigated how various mechanisms of breaking the four - fold lattice symmetry of a three - orbital model for fe - as planes manifest themselves in the spectral density .",
    "onsite interactions bring the system here close to a sdw transition , where short - range magnetic couplings have previously been found to be more effective at breaking rotational symmetry than in the non - interacting system .",
    "we find that an orbital energy splitting and anisotropic hoppings can lead to qualitatively similar features in the interacting bands as short - range magnetic correlations : the states at @xmath59 can be found at higher energies than those at @xmath60 and can even move up to the fermi level , see also previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the band / orbital anisotropy near the fermi surface can be similarly pronounced both in cases with a strong total orbital polarization @xmath72 ( found for @xmath73 as in figure  [ fig : akw_oo ] ) and with nearly vanishing polarization @xmath74 ( found for the anisotropic afm couplings as in figure  [ fig : akw_af_af ] ) .",
    "a splitting of @xmath75 between the @xmath2 at @xmath60 and the @xmath3 states at @xmath59 , which moves the latter close to or just above the chemical potential , can be induced by ( i ) an orbital energy splitting of @xmath76 , ( ii ) @xmath64 anisotropy in the hopping parameter @xmath63 and ( iii ) a magnetic anisotropy of @xmath77 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions .",
    "there are differences in the results obtained in the three scenarios : in the case of an orbital splitting , the changes around @xmath58 are more pronounced than in either the magnetic scenario of the scenario with anisotropic hopping . in the latter case ,",
    "the spectra appear less coherent even near the fermi level , and the @xmath3 band going from @xmath65 to @xmath59 almost disappears except for states very close to @xmath59 that are above the fermi level . comparing to arpes  @xcite , this lack of coherence does not appear to be in good agreement .",
    "distinction between the other two scenarios is more difficult and has previously been discussed for an orbital energy difference in the non - interacting model  @xcite .",
    "the conclusions drawn there remain valid for the interacting model : arpes data look more consistent with slighter changes around @xmath65 than those arising from an orbital energy difference large enough to raise the states at @xmath59 to the fermi level",
    ". however , it has to be stressed that both our model ( including only the three most important orbitals ) and our method ( where the impact of onsite correlations is only treated exactly within a very small four - site cluster ) imply substantial approximations .",
    "the most robust conclusion to be drawn might thus be that a decision between the scenarios based on experimental arpes data remains difficult . finally , it is also thinkable that different mechanisms are driving the breaking of the fourfold lattice symmetry in various compounds of the pnictide family .",
