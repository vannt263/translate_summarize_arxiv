    "in the @xmath2 skyrme model @xcite , atomic nuclei of nucleon ( or baryon ) number @xmath3 can be identified with soliton solutions of conserved topological charge @xmath3 which are known as skyrmions . by numerically relaxing initial skyrme configurations created with the rational map ansatz @xcite and its multilayer versions @xcite ,",
    "minimal - energy skyrmion solutions have been constructed with various baryon numbers up to @xmath4 @xcite . in order to make contact with nuclear physics experiments",
    "it is necessary to semiclassically quantize these skyrmion solutions .",
    "traditionally this is done by treating skyrmions as rigid bodies that can rotate in both space and isospace .",
    "this means that one quantizes just the rotational and isorotational zero modes of each skyrmion solution of a given @xmath3 and then determines the spin and isospin quantum numbers @xcite which are compatible with the symmetries of the static , classical soliton .",
    "this approach neglects any deformations and symmetry changes due to centrifugal effects .",
    "this rigid - body - type approximation resulted in qualitative and encouraging quantitative agreement with experimental nuclear physics data : for even @xmath3 the allowed quantum states for each skyrmion often match the experimentally observed states of nuclei , and the energy spectra of a number of light nuclei have been reproduced to a quite good degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "however , nuclei of odd mass number are not well described by this approach . many spin and isospin states",
    "do not appear in the right order or are not even predicted by the rigid - body quantization of the skyrmion .",
    "one promising way to improve the agreement with experimental data is to allow skyrmion solutions to deform when they spin and isospin .",
    "this can change the symmetries of the solutions and might result in different allowed quantum states @xcite .    classically isospinning soliton solutions",
    "have been studied recently in the faddeev - skyrme @xcite and the baby skyrme model @xcite beyond the rigid - body approximation . in the case of the fully @xmath5-dimensional skyrme model a systematic , full numerical investigation of isospinning soliton solutions beyond the rigid - body approximation has not been performed yet .",
    "to our knowledge , numerical calculations of spinning skyrmion configurations that take into account deformations originating from the kinematical terms have been carried out exclusively for baryon numbers @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "@xcite for a related approach .",
    "it has been found that allowing for axial deformations drastically reduces the rotational energies and that in order to fit the energies of spinning skyrmions to the nucleon and delta masses , the pion mass parameter @xmath8 of the skyrme model has to be chosen much larger than its experimental value @xcite .",
    "however , all these studies impose spherical or axial symmetry on the spinning skyrme solitons to simplify the numerical computations .    in this article , we perform numerical full field simulations of isospinning skyrmion solutions with baryon numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , without imposing any spatial symmetries .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that the symmetries and energies of skyrmion solutions at a given angular frequency @xmath1 and for a given mass value @xmath11 can significantly differ from the ones of the static soliton solutions .",
    "classically isospinning skyrmion solutions can break the symmetries of the static solutions and even split apart into lower charge solutions as the angular frequency increases further",
    ". a detailed study of the extent to which the inclusion of these classical deformations can result in an improved solitonic description of nuclei is beyond the scope of the present article and will form part of a forthcoming publication .",

    "[ sec_spin_induced ] how the addition of classical isospin induces classical spin , consistent with the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints .",
