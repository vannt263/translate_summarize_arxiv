    "leptogenesis is one of the most attractive mechanisms to explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau )  @xcite .",
    "this is so because it arises naturally in simple extensions of the standard model ( sm ) which can also explain why the neutrino masses are so tiny . in this mechanism",
    "a lepton asymmetry is produced in the out of equilibrium decay of heavy majorana neutrinos , which is then partially converted into a baryon asymmetry by non - perturbative sphaleron processes ( see  @xcite for a complete review ) .",
    "in the most economical model ( type i seesaw ) the heavy neutrinos @xmath0 are sm singlets with majorana masses @xmath1 , which only interact with the lepton doublets @xmath2 and higgs field @xmath3 via yukawa interactions , @xmath4 .",
    "the number of new parameters associated to the type i seesaw with three singlets , one per each sm family , is 18 . however the baryon asymmetry @xmath5 produced via @xmath6-leptogenesis depends on a few combinations of them ( here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the baryon and entropy densities ) . when flavour effects  @xcite are not relevant the main parameters are @xmath9 , which determines the epoch of leptogenesis , @xmath10 , that gives a measure of the amount of cp violation per @xmath6-decay ( see below for a precise definition ) , and the effective mass , @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 the vev of the higgs field ) , which is an appropriate measure of the intensity of the yukawa interactions of @xmath6 . if the cp asymmetry @xmath10 is constant during leptogenesis ( which is usually a good approximation ) , the final baryon asymmetry , @xmath13 , is simply proportional to @xmath10 . in this case",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a numerical factor and @xmath16 is the so called efficiency , which carries the dynamical information and it is mainly a function of @xmath17 . by definition @xmath18 and the maximum efficiency is obtained when @xmath19  ev .",
    "this value is determined by the condition that the decay rate of @xmath6 equals the hubble expansion rate at a temperature @xmath20 , so that the yukawa interactions of @xmath6 are barely out of equilibrium at the time it becomes non - relativistic .",
    "this result is amazing given that the contribution of @xmath6 to the masses of the light neutrinos ( @xmath21 ) in the type i seesaw is expected to be of the same order as @xmath17 ( barring cancellations due to phases ) .",
    "in other words , an efficient leptogenesis mechanism suggests a scale for the light neutrino masses which is roughly of the correct order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the most simple models for leptogenesis require an interesting upper bound for the masses of the light neutrinos , @xmath22  ev in the one flavour approximation  @xcite and @xmath23  few ev when flavour effects are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the conditions described above provide a highly non - trivial connection between baryogenesis via leptogenesis and the low energy parameters @xmath24 .",
    "but this is not enough at all to probe leptogenesis .",
    "unfortunately in the most simple models no more generic relations can be established between leptogenesis and low energy parameters .",
    "in fact , for a very hierarchical spectrum of heavy singlet neutrinos @xmath25 , the @xmath26-violating cp asymmetry generated in the decay of the lightest singlet has an upper bound proportional to @xmath9 , the so - called davidson - ibarra ( di ) bound @xcite .",
    "this implies a lower bound @xmath27  gev for the mass of the sterile neutrinos in order for @xmath6-dominated leptogenesis to be successful .",
    "careful numerical studies show that the di bound can be evaded for moderate hierarchies , e.g. the lower bound on @xmath9 is relaxed by more than one order of magnitude with respect to the hierarchical limit one for @xmath28  @xcite . however to reach these low values of @xmath9 some unlikely cancellations are needed , which are not motivated by any underlying symmetry .",
    "flavour effects do not substantially change this result",
    ". therefore leptogenesis occurs at very high energies in these scenarios .",
    "in addition no generic relation can be made between low and high energy phases , i.e. leptogenesis can work for any value of the observable pmns phases  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "leptogenesis in the context of the type i seesaw with hierarchical heavy neutrinos provides a simple and natural explanation to the bau , but it will not be possible to test this scenario in foreseeable experiments .",
    "this has motivated research in different directions .",
    "for example in  @xcite some ways to falsify ( rather than probe ) leptogenesis at the lhc were investigated .",
    "also , one can avoid the di bound resorting to resonant leptogenesis , i.e. , a resonant enhancement of the cp asymmetry which occurs when there are at least two strongly degenerated heavy neutrinos , such that @xmath29 , being @xmath30 their decay width  @xcite . in this scenario , leptogenesis is feasible at much lower temperatures , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however it is not enough to have leptogenesis at the tev scale in order to probe it .",
    "this is so because the most crucial parameters for observing effects from the heavy neutrinos are the active - sterile neutrino mixings , which in the type i seesaw are roughly given by the ratio @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 ) , and hence are too small .",
    "therefore it is very interesting that there are well motivated seesaw models which not only yield a heavy neutrino quasi - degenerate spectrum but can also provide a large active - sterile neutrino mixing , namely those that have an approximately conserved @xmath34  @xcite ( with @xmath26 being conserved at the perturbative level ) . in these models the tiny neutrino masses are proportional to small lepton number - breaking parameters , which are technically natural since a larger symmetry",
    "is realized when they vanish .",
    "this implies that the heavy neutrinos can be much lighter than in the generic seesaw , within the energy reach of lhc .",
    "also , lepton flavour violating rare decays as well as non - unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix are present even in the limit of conserved @xmath34 , and therefore they are unsuppressed by the light neutrino masses @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", much attention has been devoted recently to this class of low scale seesaw models , since they have a rich phenomenology both at lhc @xcite and at low energy charged lepton rare decay experiments , such as @xmath35 , and also lead to successful resonant leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "it has also been noticed that even if the heavy neutrinos that generate the bau are not quasi dirac , or the mass splitting is outside the resonant regime , in seesaw models with almost conserved @xmath34 the scale of leptogenesis can be lower than in the standard seesaw @xcite , provided flavour effects are at work .",
    "this is so because there is a @xmath26-conserving part in the flavoured cp - asymmetries which escapes the di bound . in these notes",
    "we review and summarize the results of  @xcite on the possibility of having successful leptogenesis driven by the purely flavoured @xmath26-conserving contribution to the cp asymmetries , in the context of seesaw models with small violation of @xmath34 .",
    "in general there are at least two species of neutrinos involved in leptogenesis , one , called here @xmath6 , which is mainly responsible for the generation of the lepton asymmetry during its production and decay , and another one , @xmath36 , that makes the most important virtual contribution to the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 decays . if @xmath34 is only slightly violated , then each @xmath0 must satisfy one of the two following conditions :    * @xmath0 is a majorana neutrino with two degrees of freedom , whose yukawa interactions violate lepton number and therefore the couplings @xmath37 must be small . *",
    "the @xmath0 is a dirac or quasi - dirac neutrino with four degrees of freedom ; this means that there are two majorana neutrinos @xmath38 and @xmath39 with masses @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 measures the amount of @xmath34 violation , so that if @xmath34 is conserved , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a dirac fermion .",
    "the yukawa interactions can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath47 induce lepton number violation even when @xmath48 and hence they are similar in nature to the ones described in ( i ) .",
    "instead the @xmath49 can be large , because they do not vanish in the @xmath34 conserved limit : in the absence of @xmath50 and @xmath47 , a perturbatively conserved lepton number can be defined , by assigning @xmath51 to @xmath0 , and @xmath52 to the sm leptons .",
    "there are two cases that are relatively easy to analyze , * * ( iia ) @xmath53 ( dirac limit ) , and * * ( iib ) @xmath54 ( majorana limit ) .",
    "+ here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the decay widths of @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "a comprehensive research on leptogenesis in models with small violation of @xmath34 can be obtained considering the different possibilities ( i ) or ( ii ) for both @xmath6 and @xmath36 .",
    "since we have not considered the widely - studied case of a resonant contribution of @xmath36 to the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 decays , the optimum situation for generating a lepton asymmetry is when @xmath36 satisfies ( ii ) . in this way",
    "the cp asymmetries @xmath57 in the decays of @xmath6 into leptons of flavour @xmath58 , @xmath59 , being proportional to the yukawa couplings of @xmath36 , can be enhanced . in turn , for @xmath6 the simplest possibility is ( i ) .",
    "it can also satisfy ( iib ) , in which case @xmath60 and @xmath61 behave as two independent majorana neutrinos regarding the generation of the bau , that would roughly double with respect to case ( i ) .",
    "however if @xmath6 satisfies ( iia ) , then it is ( or effectively behaves as ) a dirac neutrino , i.e. lepton number is conserved in its decays , and therefore the only possibilities to end up with a non - zero bau is to have important washouts from the two majorana components of @xmath36 ( if @xmath62 ) or let the sphalerons freeze out during leptogenesis  @xcite .    motivated by the previous discussion we have considered a scenario for leptogenesis involving three fermion singlets @xmath63 ( each of them having two degrees of freedom ) , with respective masses @xmath64 and yukawa couplings given by the lagrangian @xmath65 the parameters @xmath66 violate lepton number and hence @xmath67 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite it is convenient to take @xmath68 in order to obtain the lowest energy scale for leptogenesis within this framework , which corresponds to the so called @xmath6-leptogenesis",
    ". then @xmath13 is proportional to the cp asymmetries @xmath57 , which have a @xmath26-violating part suppressed by the small @xmath26-violating parameter @xmath69 and an unsuppressed @xmath26-conserving piece , @xmath70 , whose contribution to the total cp asymmetry is null , i.e. @xmath71 . in order to have a large @xmath13 ( not suppressed by @xmath69 ) ,",
    "it is mandatory to have flavour effects so that there is a contribution to @xmath13 coming from @xmath70  @xcite . in turn , to have the appropriate flavour effects , it is crucial to demand that the couplings of @xmath6 and @xmath36 be small enough , such that the yukawa interactions of the @xmath72 are the strongest ones ( see  @xcite for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "when this happens the density matrix of leptons is diagonal in the orthogonal basis @xmath73 , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 being determined by the fastest interaction acting in the plane perpendicular to @xmath76 .",
    "something similar occurs in the antilepton sector .",
    "then , as a first approximation , the lepton asymmetries in the flavours @xmath77 , and @xmath75 evolve independently . in this case , although @xmath71 , @xmath13 can get contributions from the individual @xmath70 .",
    "this is so because the final amount of lepton asymmetry in a given flavour also depends on how much of the produced asymmetry was erased , and this can be different for each flavour .",
    "actually the evolutions of the different lepton flavour asymmetries are not completely independent . on one hand ,",
    "spectator processes  @xcite effectively couple the flavour asymmetries , nevertheless we have checked that their effect on @xmath13 is at most a few tens of percent .",
    "one the other hand , there are @xmath26-conserving but @xmath78-violating scatterings @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , hereafter called generically flavour changing interactions ( fci ) , which are inherent to models with an approximately conserved @xmath34 .",
    "the fci play a crucial role because they tend to equilibrate the different flavour asymmetries  @xcite , effectively diminishing flavour effects and consequently @xmath13 .",
    "the cross sections of the fci have been calculated in  @xcite , finding important differences with previous literature .    summarizing , in order to determine the bau generated in models for leptogenesis with small violation of @xmath34",
    ", it is very important to consider the fci and the adequate conditions for having flavour effects .",
    "the set of boltzmann equations ( be ) taking into account these elements can be read in  @xcite . for the case",
    "@xmath82 the be are like the ones typically found in the literature . instead ,",
    "if @xmath83 then @xmath84 and @xmath85 combine to form a dirac neutrino @xmath86 , and therefore there is an asymmetry generated among the degrees of freedom of @xmath36 which has to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters for leptogenesis are @xmath9 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , the projectors @xmath90 , and @xmath69 .",
    "we have determined the minimum value of @xmath9 compatible with successful leptogenesis as a function of @xmath87 , maximizing @xmath13 over the remaining parameters . to obtain the baryon asymmetry we have solved numerically the appropriate set of",
    "be   scatterings  @xcite .",
    "however we have checked that their inclusion modifies the results by at most a few tens of percent . ] , and to get successful leptogenesis we have required @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the result is represented with the thick continuous curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the red line corresponding to the case @xmath82 and the green one to @xmath83 .     yielding successful leptogenesis as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "the red curves are for the case @xmath82 and the green ones for @xmath83 .",
    "the thick continuous curves give the physically correct bound , while the thin dashed ones show the result that would be obtained if the yukawa couplings of @xmath36 were allowed to take values as large as 1 for all values of @xmath87 . ]",
    "as can be seen it is possible to have neutrino masses as low as @xmath92  gev , i.e. around three orders of magnitude below the lower bound for the standard case of type i seesaw with hierarchical heavy neutrinos .",
    "such lower bound on @xmath9 in turn yields a lower bound for the reheating temperature , @xmath93 , of the same order , since to thermally produce the neutrinos @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence is that the bound @xmath95  gev can be compatible with the upper bound on @xmath93 required to avoid the gravitino problem in sugra models  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 values around @xmath96  gev can be achieved for a wide range of @xmath36 masses and also for different values of the yukawa couplings ( see  @xcite for details on this point as well as on the relation between the parameters defined above and the light neutrino masses ) .",
    "an important issue for obtaining the bound on @xmath9 has been to determine how large the yukawa couplings of @xmath36 can be without violating the condition that the rates of processes involving @xmath36 be slower than the rates of the @xmath72-yukawa interactions . for comparison we have also plotted in fig .  [ fig:1 ] the -wrong- bound that would be obtained if @xmath89 were allowed to be as large as 1 .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath97 approaches @xmath9 the requirement of an upper bound for @xmath89 becomes very relevant .",
    "finally let us comment that for simplicity the results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] were obtained assuming that @xmath98 is perpendicular to the decay eigenstates of @xmath6 and @xmath36 , so that only two flavour asymmetries are generated .",
    "we have checked that in the more general three flavour case it is possible to lower the bound on @xmath9 by a factor up to almost 4 with respect to the two flavour case  @xcite .",
    "seesaw models with an almost conserved @xmath34 are an interesting alternative to explain the smallness of neutrino masses because they can lead , in principle , to large active - sterile neutrino mixings .",
    "we have found another merit of these models , namely that leptogenesis is possible for @xmath99  gev , i.e. around three orders of magnitude below the standard type i seesaw case , without resorting to the resonant enhancement of the cp asymmetry for strongly degenerate heavy neutrinos .",
    "however , it is also clear that such energy scale is too large to have both , successful non - resonant leptogenesis and active - sterile neutrino mixings large enough to produce observable effects .",
