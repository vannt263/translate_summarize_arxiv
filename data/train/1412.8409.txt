    "the notion of a heffter array @xmath0 was first defined by archdeacon in @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that a heffter array with a pair of special orderings can be used to construct an embedding of the complete graph @xmath15 on a surface .",
    "the connection is given in the following theorem .",
    "[ heffter1]@xcite given a heffter array @xmath0 with compatible orderings @xmath16 of the symbols in the rows of the array and @xmath17 on the symbols in the columns of the array , then there exists an embedding of @xmath15 such that every edge is on a face of size @xmath3 and a face of size @xmath4 .",

    "( in a subsequent paper ( see @xcite ) we will address the ordering problem in more detail . ) we refer the reader to @xcite for the definition of a simple ordering and the definition of compatible orderings .",
    "theorem [ heffter1 ] can be stated in design theoretic terms .",
    "a @xmath8cycle system on @xmath18 points is a decomposition of the edges of @xmath19 into @xmath8cycles .",
    "a @xmath8cycle system @xmath20 on @xmath19 is _ cyclic _ if there is a labeling of the vertex set of @xmath19 with the elements of @xmath21 such that the permutation @xmath22 preserves the cycles of @xmath20 .",
    "a biembedding of an @xmath7cycle system and a @xmath8cycle system is a face 2-colorable topological embedding of the complete graphs @xmath15 in which one color class is comprised of the cycles in the @xmath7cycle system and the other class contains the cycles in the @xmath8cycle system .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for general information on @xmath8cycle systems , to @xcite for cyclic @xmath8cycle systems and to @xcite for information about biembedings of cycle systems .",
    "while not using heffter arrays , @xcite and @xcite gives a related idea of embedding a single 2-fold triple system .",
    "the following proposition about cycle systems follows from theorem [ heffter1 ] .",
    "[ heffter - cycle ] assume there exists a heffter array @xmath0 with compatible orderings @xmath16 of the symbols in the rows of the array and @xmath17 on the symbols in the columns of the array such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both simple .",

    "each row and each column contains @xmath30 filled cells , 2 .   the symbols in every row and every column sum to 0 in @xmath11 , and 3 .   for every element @xmath31 either @xmath13 or @xmath14 appears in the array .    in @xcite the authors study the case where the heffter array has no empty cells . in that paper",

    "we extend the idea of shiftable to any array .",
    "an @xmath40 array @xmath41 of integers ( possibly with empty cells ) is _ shiftable _ if each row and each column contains the same number of positive and negative numbers .",

    "so if @xmath41 is shiftable with support @xmath23 and @xmath13 a nonnegative integer , then @xmath43 has the same row and column sums as @xmath41 and has support @xmath44 . in the case of a shiftable heffter array @xmath45 , the array @xmath46 will have row and column sums equal to zero and support @xmath47 .",
    "the following lemma gives necessary conditions for the existence of @xmath28 and @xmath45 .",
    "[ necessary ] if there exists an @xmath28 , then necessarily @xmath48 ( mod 4 ) .",
