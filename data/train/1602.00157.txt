    "quantum mechanics in its standard form deals with systems like free particle , simple harmonic oscillator , hydrogen atom etc . , all of which exhibit conservation of energy . even when we want to account for interaction with external fields like magnetic field or electric field the number of degrees of freedom that facilitate energy exchange is small and hence can be formulated using a hamiltonian with real eigen values .",
    "however , when it comes to the case of dissipative systems , the degrees of freedom responsible for system - environment interaction grow enormously @xcite and standard tools of quantum mechanics are not sufficient .",
    "this makes the problem of having a quantum mechanical description of dissipative systems extremely challenging and difficult @xcite .",
    "this has been an area of active study and several tools have been developed to describe various aspects of quantum systems in the presence of dissipative effects ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the damped harmonic oscillator provides a toy model to study dissipative systems .",
    "there have been several attempts to obtain a consistent quantum theory with the correct classical limit of this system .",
    "some of the approaches which have been notably successful include bateman s dual oscillator approach and the caldirola - kanai hamiltonian with time dependent mass",
    ". a review of the approaches with a comprehensive list of references can be found in @xcite .",
    "more recently , this system has been analyzed from quantum field theory perspective in @xcite and via feynman path integral in @xcite .",
    "some of the recent studies of the damped oscillator have been carried out in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "extensive work has been done to model dissipation by coupling system and environment using a system - environment coupling term in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "since dissipation involves energy being transferred out of the system into the environment , there have been efforts to try to describe such systems using hamiltonians which are non - hermitian .",
    "traditionally non - hermitian hamiltonians have been used to phenomenologically describe processes which lead to a non conservation on particle number , eg radioactive decay , scattering and transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "although , in most cases , non - hermitian hamiltonians are phenomenological which are introduced heuristically , they give a mathematical consistent formalism of describing a system coupled with a continuum of states @xcite .",
    "understanding such hamiltonians and their properties and applications is a current area of active research from both theoretical and experimental perspectives @xcite . in particular , they have been used to study damped oscillator systems @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that if we consider the system of interest and the environment together as a single system , then that system is not dissipative .",
    "however such a description , though complete , will not be of much use unless we manage to _ integrate out _ the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "that is not the path we take in this paper .",
    "here we try to build up tools which can provide an _ effective _ quantum description of only the dissipative system . we will provide a prescription for constructing quantum mechanical description of dissipative systems using non - hermitian hamiltonians similar to the path followed in @xcite although our motivation and approach is quite different .",
    "our goal is the following : given a classical ( dissipative ) system , we propose a quantum ( non - hermitian ) hamiltonian operator such that , for a given class of states , the expectation values of certain operators are peaked about their classical values .",
    "the operators we are concerned with are the ones corresponding to classical measurables .",
    "we use coherent states of the corresponding non - dissipative systems to calculate the expectation values .",
    "the justification for the correctness of this proposed construction is that the expectation values agrees with the ones calculated using other methods in literature .",
    "in addition to the simplicity of the procedure , another major advantage of our construction is that in the limit where the dissipation goes to zero , our results naturally goes over to the results of the conservative system .    in this paper",
    ", we will also deal with the leaky cavity which is another dissipative system that finds its application in some areas of experimental physics including laser physics and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "usually the quantity of interest in dealing with such systems is the radiation loss due to leakage .",
    "a lot of progress has been made in the study of quantization modes of leaky cavities ( see @xcite and references therein ) and it is not possible to summarize it in one paragraph . very briefly , one of the more popular approaches is using the gardiner - collett hamiltonian @xcite where the cavity field is described in terms of normal modes as if the cavity were perfect and closed",
    ". the leakage is modelled by introducing an ad - hoc coupling with a reservoir .",
    "finally the reservoir states are integrated out to obtain a master equation which contains information about the modes in the cavity .",
    "we are not really interested in the technical aspects of this problem but in this paper we show how our formalism for the damped oscillator can be directly mapped onto the problem of the leaky cavity which can then be solved in the same way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ sec : dissipat ] ) we start by reviewing a general quantum mechanical formalism for a complex hamiltonian systems . section ( [ sec : dho ] ) illustrates the application of formalism so developed to model damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) . our proposal , makes an improvement to the scheme suggested in @xcite which greatly simplifies the procedure of quantum - classical correspondence using ehrenfest s theorem . in section ( [ sec : leaky ] ) section we investigate the phenomenon of radiation leakage in cavity using complex hamiltonians .",
    "we postulate hamiltonian that allows for polarization dependent decay factors and then derive the time evolution of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this gives a novel treatment of the leaky cavity problem which has not appeared in literature before .",
    "we finally end with conclusions in section ( [ sec : conclude ] ) .",
    "in this section , we explore some of the features of a general non - hermitian hamiltonian . since most dissipative systems are modeled by adding a dissipative part to an initially conservative system , we will also assume that our hamiltonian has distinct conservative and dissipative pieces .",
    "we will be closely following the treatment given in @xcite .",
    "let us start with the following hamiltonian @xmath0 where , in anticipation we have added the subscript @xmath1 to stand for dissipative system .",
    "we further require the following conditions to be satisfied    * @xmath2 where , @xmath3 is hamiltonian of undamped system * @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is damping part of hamiltonian * @xmath6=0 $ ]    the third condition is to ensure the existence of simultaneous eigenkets for @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "this will also ensure that the hamiltonian ( [ dissiphamilt ] ) will have a complex eigenvalues .",
    "now , given a quantum system described by state @xmath7 its time evolution as governed by the time dependent schroedinger equation @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is now a non - unitary time evolution operator .    since , hamiltonian @xmath3 is time independent this implies that hamiltonians at different time commute .",
    "thus , we can find out finite time evolution of state @xmath7 for time @xmath10 as @xmath11 it is well known that probability is not conserved under evolution by a non unitary operator . to see that consider an initially normalized state @xmath7 @xmath12 where we have expanded the state @xmath7 in terms of the energy eigenstates of the undamped system @xmath13 .",
    "note that we are assuming that the energy eigenstates of the undamped system span the whole hilbert space . also note that since @xmath6=0 $ ] , the kets @xmath13 are simultaneous eigenkets of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .    under time evolution ( [ fintimevol ] ) we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the eigenvalues of @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "since , time evolution is non unitary in nature , the norm is no longer time independent and must evolve according to @xmath17 the time derivative of the norm is given by @xmath18 to obtain a consistent physical interpretation in such cases we will have to slightly modify the notion of time evolution of expectation values of any operator . given any observable @xmath19 , we define its expectation value at time @xmath10 with respect to state @xmath20 to be @xmath21 where we have defined the state , @xmath22 which is normalized for all times .    to find ( [ expectop ] ) we can use ( [ fintimevol ] ) to obtain @xmath23\\ket{\\psi , t}-i\\bra{\\psi , t}\\left\\{\\hat{\\gamma},\\hat{a}\\right\\}\\ket{\\psi , t } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath24:= \\hat{a}\\hat{h}-\\hat{h}\\hat{a}$ ] and @xmath25 .",
    "using ( [ derivnorm ] ) and ( [ expevol ] ) we find the time derivative of expectation value of operator @xmath19 as @xmath26\\ket{\\phi , t}-2i\\delta^2_{a\\gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath27 .",
    "note that , as expected , all the deviations from standard quantum mechanics involve only the non - hermitian term @xmath5 and its eigenvalues .",
    "when the dissipation goes to zero we get back our standard quantum mechanics .",
    "we further observe that the schroedinger equation ( [ diftimevol ] ) can be modified to account for time dependent normalization factor .",
    "the modified non - linear schroedinger equation can be written in terms of normalized states @xmath28 using ( [ derivnorm ] ) as @xmath29\\ket{\\phi , t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath30=\\hat{\\gamma}\\ket{\\phi , t}\\bra{\\phi , t}-\\ket{\\phi , t}\\bra{\\phi , t}\\hat{\\gamma}$ ] and @xmath31 is the projection operator on state @xmath32 .",
    "this is a brief overview of the modifications we obtain in the standard quantum mechanics , if we start with an explicit non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "so far , it is just a mathematical curiosity and we have not made any comments on the physical interpretation . in the subsequent sections we will use this formalism to explore some dissipative systems . in each of those contexts , the motivation and",
    "the interpretation of the additional @xmath33 term will become clear .",
    "the simplest dissipative system in classical theory is damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) whose classical equation of motion is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is damping coefficient while @xmath36 is the natural frequency . in our notation",
    "@xmath37 indicates derivative with respect to time @xmath10 .",
    "we will be dealing only with the under - damped case .",
    "the solution for the above equation of motion is given by @xmath38 where , @xmath39 .",
    "there have been multiple efforts to quantize this classical system ( see @xcite and references therein ) , each with its own strengths and weaknesses . in this section",
    "we will propose a quantization scheme , based on the formalism developed in the previous section , for the dho .",
    "we will postulate a non - hermitian hamiltonian for the dho and show that , for a certain class of states , we recover the classical equations of motion via ehrenfest theorem .",
    "another attractive feature of our quantum theory is that it naturally reduces to theory of simple harmonic oscillator(sho ) as damping coefficient @xmath40 .",
    "we propose the following hamiltonian operator for the dho @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number operator and @xmath35 has dimensions of @xmath43^{-1}$ ] .",
    "comparing with formalism of section ( [ sec : dissipat ] ) we can see that the dissipative part of hamiltonian is taken to be @xmath44 .    in an attempt to attain correct classical limit",
    "we shall use the coherent states of sho ( [ coherent ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of a coherent state can be easily calculated using ( [ fintimevol ] ) @xmath45 obviously the norm will not be preserved under time evolution . the time dependent norm",
    "will now be given by ( [ tdepnorm ] ) @xmath46 the states we are interested in are the normalized coherent state which we label as @xmath47 , are given by @xmath48 these are the states which are physically relevant .",
    "all the expectation values calculated subsequently in this section are with respect to these states . in particular , the time dependent normalization naturally ensures that as time progresses the probability of finding the system in higher excited state decreases and the probability of finding the oscillator in lower excited states simultaneously increases .",
    "this is exactly what we hope to model while studying a dissipative system .",
    "it is well known that coherent states are minimum uncertainty states for a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "we are using the same coherent states ( with an additional time dependent normalization ) to study the damped oscillator . to understand the nature of these states for our system",
    "let us calculate the expectation value of position and momentum operator @xmath49 since , @xmath50 in general is a complex number , its real and imaginary part essentially contains information about initial position @xmath51 and momentum @xmath52 respectively , i.e. @xmath53 we further observe that the variances of position and momentum operators are given by @xmath54e^{-2\\gamma t }   = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega_d } \\\\",

    "@xmath56 also note that this uncertainty is independent of time .",
    "thus , the normalized coherent states of sho ( [ coherent ] ) with an additional appropriate time dependent normalization form minimum uncertainty states for the dho .",
    "these states provide a good description of the damped system for all times .    to show that the energy of the damped system actually decays with time",
    "let us calculate the expectation value @xmath57 of hamiltonian corresponding to simple harmonic oscillator with respect to ( [ normalcoh ] ) .",

    "we can easily calculate the expectation value for the full dho hamiltonian ( [ dhohamilt ] ) as @xmath61 note that in the second step we have to divide by @xmath62 as the states considered in equation ( [ derivnorm ] ) are not normalized .",
    "the real part of expectation value of @xmath63 contains information about decay of energy and the imaginary part tells about change of norm with respect to time .    in order to establish connection with classical mechanics using ehrenfest s theorem",
    "let us use equation ( [ expectopevol ] ) for finding out the evolution of position and momentum operators .",

    "although the analysis done in this section is similar to the one in @xcite , the key difference lies in the choice of states .",
    "we do not use the coherent states @xmath66 for taking the expectation values but the states @xmath67 which include a time dependent normalization .",
    "the advantage of using our states is that the understanding of classical limit and time evolution of measurable quantities become greatly simplified .",
    "moreover the expectation values from quantum theory reproduces the correct classical equations of motion which remain valid for all times .    to recap , in this section we have used the formalism described in the previous section to obtain a quantum description of the damped oscillator system .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is non - hermitian ( [ dhohamilt ] ) .",
    "the states we chose to study the system are simply the coherent states of the simple harmonic oscillator multiplied by a time dependent normalization factor ( [ normalcoh ] ) . we show that these states have a very nice interpretation as minimum uncertainty states .",
    "if we view this system as a simple harmonic oscillator which loses energy due to some damping process , the energy loss by the dissipative process is demonstrated by the fact that the probability of finding the oscillator in the higher energy eigenstates decreases with time .",
    "we also demonstrate that we obtain the correct classical limit via the ehrenfest theorem .",
    "one major advantage of this formalism over some of the others @xcite is that the uncertainty principle is not violated even for @xmath60 and the fact that it is trivial to take the limit @xmath68 .",
    "this formalism for describing dissipative systems can be applied to more general settings as we shall show in the next section",
    "the ideal case of radiation inside a cavity problem is treated with cavity being made up of perfectly conducting boundaries @xcite . in reality however , cavity walls can have finite transmission coefficient , thus allowing for the radiation to decay or ` leak ' through . when considering the leaky cavity , we shall assume that thermal fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "we also assume that the decay time is much longer than the speed of electromagnetic radiation in the cavity . in that case",
    ", we can neglect the fact that the leakage loss is localized at the boundaries and assume that the loss changes the electromagnetic field inside the entire cavity @xcite . again",
    ", this analysis should not be taken as a realistic study of the leaky cavity problem but more as a demonstration of how non - hermitian hamiltonians can help tackle such problems in general .",
    "in this section we will map leaky cavity problem to that of a damped oscillator and show how it can be used to obtain how the electromagnetic fields change with time in that case .",
    "our derivation is in the same spirit as done in @xcite with slight modifications . after obtaining suitable hamiltonian",
    ", we will add a complex part and use the formalism developed in previous sections to derive expressions for electric and magnetic fields in presence of leakage .",
    "we will then give a physical interpretation of decay in terms of photon number .",
    "let us consider an ideal cuboidal cavity .",
    "the wave equation that vector potential @xmath69 has to obey inside the cavity in radiation gauge is given by @xmath70 where , @xmath71 is laplacian operator in 3-dimensions .",
    "the boundary conditions demand the fields to vanish at boundaries of the cavity .",
    "this means that @xmath69 can admit only standing wave solutions .",
    "the most general solution however , can be written as fourier expansion of standing waves of different wavelengths , @xmath72 where , @xmath73 are real constant vectors , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are components of wave vector @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the angular frequency of wave corresponding to wave vector @xmath77 and is given as @xmath79 .",
    "if the dimensions of cavity along @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 axis are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 respectively then boundary conditions demand @xmath86 where , @xmath87 as that there will be no fields corresponding to zero mode due to boundary conditions . expressing the sines and cosines in ( @xmath88 ) in terms of exponentials we have @xmath89 \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\sum_{\\textbf{k}=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left [ \\tilde{\\textbf{b}}_\\textbf{k}e^{i\\textbf{k}.\\textbf{r}}+ \\tilde{\\textbf{b}}^*_{\\bf{-k}}e^{i\\textbf{k}.\\textbf{r}}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath90 are now constant complex 3-dimensional vectors such that @xmath91 and @xmath92 . here , we have expressed ( [ solstanding ] ) in terms of standing wave solutions for each @xmath77 .",
    "this is done so as to create mapping between electromagnetic and simple harmonic oscillator system .",
    "we further notice that due to ( [ gaugeconda ] ) , fields have two independent direction of polarization for a given direction of propagation @xmath77 .",
    "let us denote these by @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",

    "we further observe that we can specialize our field expressions for the case of single mode cavity as studied in @xcite by taking @xmath139 where @xmath140 depends upon cavity dimensions and boundary reflectivity .",
    "this gives us the following expression for fields @xmath141 these results agree with the ones given in @xcite .",
    "the formalism developed here is novel and much simpler than the ones existing in literature .",
    "obviously the shape we have chosen for our cavity ( cuboid ) , makes the problem much simpler than the more realistic situations encountered in literature .",

    "another advantage of this formalism is that it can be easily generalized to study cavities whose walls allow only particular polarizations or particular frequencies in specific directions to leak through .",
    "it also allows the analysis of leakage of multiple modes in one go .",
    "we think that this procedure can be a powerful analytical tool to study leaky cavities .",
    "in this paper , we have made an improvement to the existing idea @xcite of describing dissipative systems via non hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "the main difference from existing treatments is our use of coherent states with time dependent normalization ( [ normalcoh ] ) . as we show in this paper , using these states",
    "greatly simplify the derivation of the classical limit .",
    "moreover , these states have a nice physical interpretation as they clearly show that in a dissipative system , owing to the loss of energy to the environment , the probability of finding the system in the higher energy states reduces with time .",
    "we demonstrate this procedure for two dissipative system , the standard damped harmonic oscillator example and the problem of radiation in a leaky cavity . for the leaky cavity problem",
    ", we show that if the cavity is cuboidal , the problem can be mapped on the damped oscillator system .",
    "although the geometry of the chosen cavity greatly simplified the problem , it is possible to apply the same formalism to cavities of any shape . that is a direction of future work .",
    "the damped oscillator spectrum can also be mapped on to several dissipative systems .",
    "one of such systems of particular interest is the mapping on to quasi - normal modes of a black hole @xcite .",
    "exploring our formalism in this and other general relativistic systems is one of the problems we are currently exploring .",
    "another possible direction of future work using this formalism is addressing the problem of quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "decoherence arises from the loss of information from the system to the surroundings consequently leading to non - unitary time evolution of the system .",
    "one of the ways of modelling decoherence is through adding interference terms linking the system and surrounding which ultimately drive the system to classicality @xcite .",
    "obviously non hermitian hamiltonians play a significant role in such processes . whether the states we use in this paper help us improve our understanding of decoherence is an interesting question for future research .",
    "for completeness , we give a brief pedagogical review of quantum treatment of simple harmonic oscillator and coherent states . for detailed description reader can consult standard texts on quantum mechanics ( see @xcite for details ) . the hamiltonian operator for sho is given as , @xmath142 where , @xmath143=i\\hbar$ ] is the canonical commutation relation ( ccr ) .",

    "@xmath155 in order to establish connection with classical mechanics we can use minimum uncertainty states called as coherent states .",
    "coherent state is defined to be the eigenstates of operator @xmath144 .",
    "it can be expressed as a superposition of energy eigenstates as @xmath156 note that since , the operator @xmath144 is non - hermitian the eigenvalue @xmath50 will in general be complex .",
