    "networks of oscillators play an important role in both biological ( neural systems , circadian rythms , population dynamics )  @xcite and physical contexts ( power grids , josephson junctions , cold atoms ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore comprehensible that many studies have been and are still devoted to understanding their dynamical properties .",
    "since the development of sufficiently powerful tools and the resulting discovery of general laws is an utterly difficult task , it is convenient to start from simple setups .    the first issue to consider is the oscillator model - structure",
    ". as phases are typically more sensitive than amplitudes to mutual coupling , they are likely to provide the most relevant contribution to the collective evolution  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , here we restrict our analysis to oscillators characterized by a single , phase - like , variable .",
    "this is tipically done by reducing the neuronal dynamics to the evolution of the membrane potential and introducing the corresponding _ velocity field _ which describes the single - neuron activity .",
    "equivalently , one can map the membrane potential onto a phase variable and simultaneously introduce a phase - response curve ( prc )  @xcite to take into account the dependence of the neuronal response on the current value of the membrane potential ( i.e. the phase ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt the first point of view , with a few exceptions , when the second one is mathematically more convenient .    as for the coupling , two mechanisms",
    "are typically invoked in the literature , diffusive and pulse - mediated . while the former mechanism is pretty well understood ( see e.g. the very many papers devoted to kuramoto - like models @xcite ) , the latter one , more appropriate in neural dynamics , involves a series of subtleties that have not yet been fully appreciated .",
    "this is why here we concentrate on pulse - coupled oscillators .",
    "finally , for what concerns the topology of the interactions , globally coupled identical oscillators provide a much simplified but already challenging test bed .",
    "the high symmetry of the corresponding evolution equations simplifies the identification of the stationary solutions and the analysis of their stability properties .",
    "the two most symmetric solutions are : ( i ) the fully synchronous state , where all oscillators follow exactly the same trajectory ; ( ii ) the splay state ( also known as  ponies on a merry - go - round \" , antiphase state or rotating waves )  @xcite , where the oscillators still follow the same periodic trajectory , but with different ( evenly distributed ) time shifts .",
    "the former solution is the simplest representative of the broad class of clustered states @xcite , where several oscillators behave in the same way , while the latter is the prototype of asynchronous states , characterized by a smooth distribution of phases @xcite .    in spite of the many restrictions on the mathematical setup , the stability of the synchronous and splay states still depend significantly on additional features such as the synaptic reponse - function , the velocity field , and the presence of delay in the pulse transmission . as a result",
    ", one can encounter splay states that are either strongly stable along all directions , or that present many almost - marginal directions , or , finally , that are marginally stable along various directions  @xcite .",
    "several analytic results have been obtained in specific cases , but a global picture is still missing : the goal of this paper is to recompose the puzzle , by exploring the role of the velocity field ( or , equivalently , of the phase response curve ) and of the shape of the transmitted post - synaptic potentials .    in pulse - coupled oscillators ,",
    "even the stability assessment of the fully synchronous regime is far from trivial : in fact , the pulse emission introduces a discontinuity which requires separating the evolution before and after such event .",
    "moreover , when many neurons spike at the same time , the length of some interspike intervals is virtually zero but can not be neglected in the mathematical analysis .",
    "in fact , the first study of this problem was restricted to excitatory coupling and @xmath0-pulses @xcite . in that context , the stability of the synchronous state follows from the fact that when the phases of two oscillators are sufficiently close to one another , they are instantaneously reset to the same value ( as a result of a non - physical lack of invertibility of the dynamics ) .",
    "the first , truly linear stability analyses have been performed later , first in the case of two oscillators @xcite and then considering @xmath0-pulses with continuous prcs  @xcite . here , we extend the analysis to generic pulse - shapes and discontinuous prcs ( such as for leaky integrate and fire ( lif ) neurons ) .    as for the splay states ,",
    "their stability can be assessed in two ways : ( i ) by assuming that the number of oscillators is infinite ( i.e. taking the so called thermodynamic limit ) and thereby studying the evolution of the distribution of the membrane potentials  this approach is somehow equivalent to dealing with ( macroscopic ) liouville - type equations in statistical mechanics ; ( ii ) by dealing with the ( microscopic ) equations of motion for a large but finite number @xmath1 of oscillators .",
    "as shown in some pioneering works @xcite , the former approach corresponds to develop a mean field theory .",
    "the resulting equations have been first solved in  @xcite for pulses composed of two exponential functions , in the limit of a small effective coupling  @xcite . here ,",
    "following  @xcite , we extend the analysis to generic pulse - shapes , finding that substantial differences exist among @xmath0 , exponential and the so - called @xmath2-pulses ( see the next section for a proper definition ) .",
    "direct numerical studies of the linear stability of finite networks suggest that the eigenfunctions of the ( floquet ) operator can be classified according to their wavelength @xmath3 ( where @xmath3 refers to the neuronal phase - see sec .",
    "[ sec:3:a ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "in finite systems , it is convenient to distinguish between long ( lw ) and short ( sw ) wavelengths . upon considering that @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , lw can be identified as those for which @xmath6 , while sw correspond to larger @xmath7 values .",
    "numerical simulations suggest also that the time scale of a lw perturbation typically increases upon increasing its wavelength , starting from a few milliseconds ( for small @xmath7 values ) up to much longer values ( when @xmath7 is on the order of the network size @xmath1 ) which depend on  details \" such as the continuity of the velocity field , or the pulse shape . on the other hand ,",
    "sw are characterized by a slow size - dependent dynamics .",
    "for instance , in lif neurons coupled via @xmath2-pulses , it has been found @xcite that the floquet exponents of lw decrease as @xmath8 ( for large @xmath3 ) , while the time scale of the sw component is on the order of @xmath9 . in practice",
    "the lw spectral component as determined from the finite @xmath1 analysis coincides with that one obtained with the mean field approach ( i.e. taking first the thermodynamic limit ) . as for the sw component , it can not be quantitatively determined by the mean - field approach , but it is nevertheless possible to infer the correct order of magnitude of this time scale .",
    "in fact , upon combining the @xmath8 decay ( predicted by the mean - field approach ) with the observation that the minimal wavelength is @xmath10 , it naturally follows that the sw time scale is @xmath9 , as analytically proved in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that the the two spectral components smoothly connect to each other and the predictions of the two theoretical approaches coincide in the crossover region .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate whether the same agreement extends to more generic pulse shapes and velocity fields .",
    "the finite-@xmath1 approach can , in principle , be generalized to arbitrary shapes , but the analytic calculations would be quite lengthy , due to the need of distinguishing between fast and slow scales and the need of accounting for higher order terms .",
    "for this reason , here we give a positive answer to this question only with the help of numerical studies .    the only , important , exception to this scenario",
    "is obtained for quasi @xmath0-like pulses @xcite , i.e. for pulses whose width is smaller than the average time sepration between any two consecutive spikes , in which case all the sw eigenvalues remain finite for increasing @xmath1 .    in sec .",

    "the evaporation exponent is determined for the synchronous state in lif neurons .",
    "the general setup considered in this paper is a network of @xmath1 identical pulse - coupled neurons ( rotators ) , whose evolution is described by the equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the membrane potential , @xmath14 is the coupling constant and @xmath15 is the _",
    "mean field_. when @xmath13 reaches the threshold value @xmath16 , it is reset to @xmath17 and a spike contributes to the mean field @xmath18 in a way that is described here below .",

    "@xcite , it is convenient to pass from a continuous to a discrete time evolution rule , by deriving the event - driven map which connects the network configuration at consecutive spike times . for the sake of simplicity , in the following part of this section we refer to @xmath2-pulses , but there is no conceptual limitation to extending the approach to @xmath38 .    by integrating eq .",

    "since all neurons follow the same first - order differential equation ( this is a mean - field model ) , the ordering of their membrane potentials is preserved ( neurons `` rotate '' around the circle @xmath43 $ ] without overtaking each other  @xcite ) .",
    "it is , therefore , convenient to order the potentials from the largest to the smallest one and to introduce a co - moving reference frame , i.e. to shift backward the label @xmath44 , each time a neuron reaches the threshold . by formally integrating eq .",

    "the computational difficulty amounts to finding the zero of a one dimensional function and , even though @xmath61 can , in most cases , be obtained only through numerical integration , the final error can be very well kept under control .",
    "the stability of a dynamical state can be assessed by either first taking the infinite time limit and then the thermodynamic limit , or vice versa . in general",
    "it is not obvious whether the two methods yield the same result and this is particularly crucial for the splay state , as many eigenvalues tend to 0 for @xmath63 . in this section",
    "we discuss the scenarios that have to be expected when the thermodynamic limit is taken first .",
    "we do that , by following abbott and van vreeswijk  @xcite .    as a first step ,",

    "the structure of the spectra depends on the smoothness of both the velocity field and the transmitted pulses .",

    "interestingly , the scaling behaviour of the eigenvalues carries over to that of the lyapunov exponents , when the network is periodically forced , suggesting that our results have a relevance that goes beyond the highly symmetric solutions studied in this paper .    finally , we derived an analytic expression for the floquet spectra for the fully synchronous state . in this case",
    "the exponents associated to the dynamics of the membrane potentials are all identical , as it happens for the diffusive coupling , but here the result is less trivial , due to the fact that one must take into account that arbitrarily close to the solution , the ordering of the neurons may be different .",

    "in fact , it turns out that the asynchronous regimes can be strongly stable along all directions only when @xmath251 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit ( and is possibly small ) .",
    "this includes the idealized case of @xmath0-like pulses , but also setups where the single pulses are so short that they can be resolved by the single neurons .",
