    "cyclic patterns of neuronal activity are ubiquitous in animal nervous systems , and partially responsible for generating and controlling rhythmic movements such as locomotion , respiration , swallowing and so on",
    ". neural networks that can produce cyclic patterned outputs without rhythmic sensory or central input are called central pattern generators ( cpgs ) .",
    "although in some lower level invertebrate animals the detailed connectivities among the identified cpg neurons have been both experimentally determined and reconstructed @xcite , both the anatomic structure and dynamics of the cpg networks in most higher vertebrate animals including human beings still remain largely unknown @xcite .",
    "while the experimental identification of the network connectivities is fundamental for fully understanding the cpg networks @xcite , recent experimental observations @xcite suggested that cpgs may be highly flexible , and some of them may even be temporarily formed only before the production of motor activity @xcite , making the experimental identification of the architecture of cpgs very difficult .",
    "observable movement features such as symmetry etc . have been used as indirect approaches to infer aspects of cpg structures @xcite . in @xcite , we started from admissible cycles ( the cycles that can be stored in a network with the pseudoinverse learning rule ) , and studied structural features of admissible cycles and how structural features determine topology of the networks constructed from admissible cycles . in this paper , following @xcite and @xcite , we continue to study how the structural features of admissible cycles determine the dynamics of the hopfield - type networks constructed from the admissible cycles with the pseudoinverse learning rule @xcite .",
    "hopfield - type networks with delayed couplings are asymmetric generalizations of the hopfield networks @xcite , and have been used as models for generating cyclic patterns @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the hopfield - type networks with discrete / distributed transmission delay(s ) has recently attracted considerable research interest from the dynamical systems theory community ( see for example @xcite etc . ) . due to its broad applications , ring networks , which are rings of unidirectionally or bidirectionally coupled neurons ,",
    "have been extensively investigated @xcite . in terms of the number of inhibitory connections ,",
    "unidirectional ring networks can be divided into even and odd networks in accordance to the parity of the number of inhibitory connections @xcite .",
    "it has been well known that odd networks are capable of generating sustained oscillations , and numerical simulations showed that although the theoretical results suggested eventual convergence of any solution trajectory in even networks @xcite , long lasting oscillations can be very easily observed @xcite .",
    "pakdaman et al .",
    "@xcite studied the asymptotic behavior of the system , and showed that the long lasting transient oscillations can not be explained by the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the network .",
    "horikawa et al and others @xcite studied different properties of the long lasting transient oscillations , such as the dependence of their durations on the number of neurons , effects of noise and variations on the durations of the long lasting transient oscillations in excitatory ring networks .",
    "campbell and collaborators @xcite studied the stability and bifurcations of both the trivial solution and the nontrivial synchronous and asynchronous periodic solutions bifurcating from the trivial solution in ring networks of bidirectionally coupled neurons . for the general continuous - time hopfield - type neural networks of @xmath2 neurons with different activation functions with and without delay ,",
    "cheng et al @xcite formulated the parameter conditions for the existence of the @xmath3 multiple stable stationary solutions , and estimated the basins of attraction of the coexisting multiple stable stationary solutions .",
    "in @xcite we studied the construction of a general class of the hopfield - type networks from arbitrarily preselected binary cyclic patterns representing phase - locked oscillations @xcite .",
    "we formulated and proved the admissibility condition for cycles under which a hopfield - type network can be constructed using the pseudoinverse learning rule @xcite . in terms of the structural features , we divided admissible cycles into three classes : simple cycles , separable and inseparable composite cycles , and showed that in terms of the structural features of admissible cycles , the topology of the networks constructed from them can be determined .",
    "networks constructed from separable cycles consist of isolated clusters , and each cluster corresponds to a simple cycle component .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of such networks is fully determined by that of the isolated clusters respectively .    in @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that due to the misalignment of the zeros of the membrane potentials of the neurons in most networks constructed from admissible cycles , most admissible cycles are retrieved as the ( delay - induced ) long - lasting transient oscillations .",
    "to discriminate between the cycles that can be retrieved as attracting limit cycles and those that can be retrieved as the long - lasting transient oscillations , we introduced the concepts of strong retrievability and weak retrievability . in networks with the parameters",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 , we proved that every admissible cycle with intermediate patterns satisfying its transition conditions is weakly retrievable @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the continuous - time hopfield - type networks that are constructed from admissible binary cyclic patterns using the pseudoinverse learning rule , and study the retrievability of admissible cycles , as well as the structures of the local bifurcations of the trivial solutions . while retrieval of static binary patterns in both continuous - time and discrete - time hopfield networks and their extensions have been extensively investigated ( e.g. @xcite ) , and studies involving storage and retrieval of oscillatory sequences in recurrent networks have been recently performed ( e.g. @xcite ) , no systematic investigation of retrievability of cyclic patterns in networks with delay(s ) have been done . in this paper , we follow @xcite to discuss retrievability of the admissible cycles in the networks with delayed couplings and more general parameter settings , i.e. @xmath6 but still large and @xmath7 . we analyze the linear stability of the trivial solution , and show how the structural features of the prescribed cycle determine structure of the possible local bifurcations of the trivial solution .",
    "accordingly , for each network constructed from an admissible cycle , the complete scenario of all possible local bifurcations of the trivial solution is obtained . with this scenario ,",
    "we study structures of local bifurcations of the trivial solution and the periodic solutions bifurcating from the trivial solution using the matlab packages matcont 3.1 and dde - biftool 2.03 .",
    "we demonstrate that the cyclic patterns prescribed in the corresponding networks are stored and retrieved as different mathematical objects . depending on their structural features ,",
    "cyclic patterns are respectively stored and retrieved as attracting limit cycles , unstable periodic solutions bifurcating from the trivial solution , and the long lasting transient oscillations @xcite , which are suggested to be the consequence of the interactions among the unstable periodic solutions and stable / unstable steady state solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , after a brief review the main results about admissibility of cycles , classification of admissible cycles , and network topology obtained in @xcite ; and _ misalignment length analysis _ ( mla ) method and the weak retrievability of a special class of admissible cycles presented in @xcite , we continue to prove that all admissible cycles satisfying the same transition conditions can be retrieved in the network constructed from the cycle imposing the transition condition and discuss retrievability of the admissible cycles in networks with more general parameter settings , i.e. @xmath1 finite but sufficiently large and @xmath8 . in section 3 , we first present a detailed discussion on the boundaries of the stability region of the trivial solution , which enable us to determine all the possible codimension one local bifurcations of the trivial solution . then with the numerical continuation and bifurcation analysis matlab package , matcont 3.1 and dde - biftool 2.03 , we continue to discuss structures of the local bifurcations of the trivial solution in networks constructed from admissible cycles with different structural features .",
    "we illustrate that admissible cycles are stored and retrieved in the networks with delay as different mathematical objects , attracting limit cycles , unstable periodic solutions and long lasting transient oscillations . in section 4",

    ". both other properties of the transient oscillations and bifurcation structures of the excitatory unidirectional ring networks were investigated by many others in the past few years too ( see for example @xcite etc . ) .    here",
    ", we may consider the networks investigated by pakdaman et al @xcite and others as a special case of our networks constructed from simple mc - cycles with @xmath401 , in which @xmath68 .",
    "we claim that the cycles retrieved in such networks corresponding to the prescribed cycles are transient oscillations described by pakdaman et al @xcite .",

    "thus , for networks constructed from simple mc - cycles , the situation is very similar to that pakdaman et al described in @xcite , and the unstable limit cycles bifurcating from the trivial equilbrium solution will stay in the boundary between the respective basins of attraction of the two non - trivial equilibrium points @xmath473 and @xmath474 , which has been proved to be a codimension one locally lipschitz manifold containing the unstable equilibrium point @xmath491 and its stable manifold @xcite .",
