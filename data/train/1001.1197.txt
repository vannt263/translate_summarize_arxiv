    "the goal of alice is to deliver messages to bob with low decoding probability while keeping eve from knowing much about the messages .",
    "the capacity of wiretap channels has been determined for discrete memoryless channels @xcite and for gaussian channels @xcite with a weaker notion of security .",
    "the capacity of the above wiretap channels are also determined with a stronger notion of security @xcite .",
    "the exponential decreasing rate of eavesdropped information is also evaluated in @xcite .",
    "shannon theoretic study of the wiretap channels is fairly advanced .",
    "on the other hand , there is still room for research in the actual construction of codes for the wiretap channels , which we call the wiretap codes .",

    "@xcite proposed an ldpc based construction for specific discrete memoryless channels , and klinc et  al .",
    "@xcite proposed another ldpc based construction for gaussian channels .",
    "hamada @xcite and hayashi @xcite proposed general linear code based construction for additive discrete memoryless channels .",
    "muramatsu and miyake proposed a construction based on the hashing property of ldpc matrices @xcite , whose decoding requires the high - complexity minimum entropy decoder .    in those constructions except @xcite , error correction and provision of secrecy are combined in the constructed coding scheme .",
    "this prevents us from using well - studied error - correcting codes for the error correction in the wiretap codes , and we need to adjust existing error - correcting codes or invent a new wiretap code .",
    "this inconvenience may not be necessary .",
    "in fact , in the quantum key distribution protocols , the error correction and the provision of secrecy can be separately studied and developed , see @xcite and references therein .    moreover , previous constructions for discrete memoryless channels do not cover all the discrete memoryless channels except @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to have a construction of wiretap codes that can be used for any discrete memoryless channels .    in this paper , we show two constructions of wiretap codes from encoder and decoder in an ordinary channel code .",
    "we do not modify the channel encoder nor decoder .",
    "we attach the two - universal hash function to the encoder and the decoder in order to realize secrecy from eve .",
    "we show that our construction can achieve the wiretap capacity in the _ strong _ security sense over discrete and gaussian memoryless channels , while some of previous constructions do not have proofs of the strong security .",
    "the key tools for our constructions are the new forms of the privacy amplification ( pa ) theorem @xcite .",
    "the original pa theorem @xcite does not achieve the optimal rate of pa , which is the conditional shannon entropy of alice s information conditioned on eve s information .",
    "renner @xcite improved it so that renner s version of the theorem can achieve the optimal rate .",
    "however , it does not enable us to construct the wiretap code using an existing channel code .",
    "the reason is that we can not numerically compute the necessay rate of hashing for a given channel code in order for eve s information on secret message to become sufficiently small .",
    "so we present two new forms of the pa theorem .",
    "one is already given in @xcite .",
    "however , it requires the random selection of a chennel encoder from the given family of channel codes .",
    "we shall provide another form of the pa theorem in theorem [ newresolvability ] , which enables us to construct a wiretap code from single channel encoder .",
