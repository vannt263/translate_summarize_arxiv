    "presently much effort is being expended to resolve the flavor of the incoming neutrino flux ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "one motivation for doing this is that the absolute sensitivity , or relative sensitivity compared with background , may be significantly greater for one neutrino species than for other species @xcite .",
    "another primary motivation for identifying the neutrino flavor is to test the hypothesis that neutrinos undergo flavor oscillation as they propagate from source to earth . because the non - oscillation production of @xmath0 is assumed to be negligible relative to @xmath1 and @xmath2 production , and the cascade @xmath0 produced by collisions of primary @xmath1 and @xmath2 flux with the relic cosmic neutrino background is orders of magnitude less than the primary @xmath1 and @xmath2 flux , any detected @xmath0 component from a source outside the solar system is currently expected to be indicative of oscillation . in this paper",
    ", we briefly report some results of our investigation into high energy @xmath0 production , presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we illustrate that the @xmath0 component at the high energy end in the hadronic decays is significantly higher than previously assumed and that this can have observational consequences .",
    "high energy neutrinos are expected to be produced by several cosmological and astrophysical sources , among others : active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite ; topological defects ( td ) such as superconducting , ordinary or vhs cosmic strings @xcite ; supermassive gauge and scalar particle ( x - particle ) decay or annihilation @xcite ; and hawking evaporation of primordial black holes ( pbh ) @xcite .",
    "also , neutrinos can originate from the decay of photoproduced hadrons on the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) . in all these scenarios",
    "the production of tau neutrinos has been assumed to be negligible compared to the production of electron and muon neutrinos .",
    "we focus our attention on those cases where , irrespective of the scenario , there are sufficiently energetic interactions that quarks and gluons which fragment into jets of hadrons are expected to be produced .",
    "the spectra of these hadrons should be very similar to those measured in @xmath3 _ hadrons _ events in colliders . as a consequence",
    ", the final state particle distributions in these scenarios are expected to be dominated by hadronic decays at the source . in these",
    "decays over 90% of the final state products will be @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , with the remainder mainly nucleons which decay into protons and antiprotons . on astrophysical timescales , the @xmath7 decay into @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the final cluster states ( pions and nucleons ) in qcd jets at accelerator energies can be loosely approximated by the hill , schramm , and walker ( hsw ) fragmentation function @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the total energy of the decaying jet @xcite .",
    "this distribution continues down to @xmath14 gev . when convolved with the @xmath7 decay , eq .",
    "( [ primdecay ] ) leads to a similarly dominant @xmath15 term in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra at @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "( for a full derivation of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra using fragmentation function ( [ primdecay ] ) see @xcite . )",
    "because @xmath0 production is suppressed compared with other species , it has been assumed in previous astrophysical and cosmological flux calculations that the @xmath0 spectrum from hadronic jets is orders of magnitude less than the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra at all @xmath19 .",
    "this is not so , once the energy of the jets surpasses the tau lepton and heavy quark masses .",
    "while indeed the total number of @xmath0 produced per jet is less than @xmath20 of the total number of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the high @xmath19 tau neutrinos are predominantly produced by the initial decays of the heavier quarks with shorter lifetimes ( the greatest contribution comes from the @xmath21 quark decay ) and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are produced by the final state cluster decays of the much lighter pions .",
    "this leads to significantly greater relative contribution from @xmath0 at high @xmath19 than previously assumed .",
    "the fragmentation distribution ( [ primdecay ] ) is no longer relevant for the tau neutrino .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the @xmath0 spectrum , together with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra , generated by the decay of 10 tev @xmath22 jets . to simulate these spectra we used the qcd event generator herwig @xcite and the process @xmath23 , @xmath24 = all @xmath25 flavors .",
    "consistent spectra are obtained with pythia / jetset ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the region @xmath26 , the tau neutrinos make up more than one tenth of the total neutrino contribution .",
    "note also that below @xmath16 , @xmath27 falls off with roughly an @xmath28 slope , and not the @xmath15 slope of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra .",
    "[ figure : nuspect ]    from our 300 gev tev simulations , we find that the @xmath0 spectrum generated by @xmath22 jet decay can be parametrized as @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] per jet .    here",
    "we apply our results to two scenarios ( for an expanded treatment see @xcite ) .",
    "the first one is the vhs cosmic string scenario . in the vhs scenario , 1 gev",
    "particle fluxes are generated by the decay of supermassive scalar and gauge particles emitted by the long strings over the age of the universe . in fig .",
    "2 we show the neutrino spectra expected at earth from vhs strings with a mass per unit length of @xmath30 @xcite . the partial @xmath0 component which is solely produced in the collisions of the primary @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the relic cosmic @xmath31 neutrino background @xcite is also shown in fig .",
    "this collision - produced @xmath0 component is the only one presented in previous cosmic string papers .",
    "as can be seen , our results give a significant increase in the expected @xmath0 signal at the highest energies .",
    "[ figure : fluxescasc ]    in the second scenario , the evaporation of pbhs , we calculate the neutrino flux from the hawking evaporation of a @xmath32 gev pbh using herwig and following the method of ref . @xcite . the instantaneous emission per degree of freedom prior to decay",
    "is given by @xmath33^{- 1 } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the absorption probability for species , @xmath35 is the spin , and @xmath36 is the black hole temperature . the neutrino flux from the evaporating pbh including hadronic decays is shown in fig .",
    "[ 100gevpbh ]",
    "previous work has assumed the @xmath0 component in tev hadronic decays to be negligible compared with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 components , at all neutrino energies .",
    "we find that this is not so once the decays are sufficiently energetic to include the heavier quarks .",
    "in particular , for neutrino energies in the decade below the energy of the initial decaying particle , the tau neutrino component is of similar magnitude to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 components .",
    "below these energies the @xmath0 spectrum exhibits a slope of slightly less than @xmath28 compared with the @xmath15 slope of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra .",
    "this analysis modifies the expected spectra in many astrophysical and cosmological high energy neutrino production scenarios . as a consequence , the observation of a significant @xmath0 to @xmath2 ratio at a given energy in high energy neutrino telescopes and detectors may be due to hadronic decay at the source and not @xmath37 oscillation in transit .",
