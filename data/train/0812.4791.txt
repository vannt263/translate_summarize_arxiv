    "the accurate determination of the zero point of the cepheid period - luminosity relation is an important step in the refinement of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "the combination of interferometric and spectroscopic data , as discussed by @xcite , is an approach to this task that is now feasible .",
    "the first demonstration of the combination of interferometric and spectroscopic data to determine both the mean diameter and distance of a cepheid was made by @xcite based on interferometric observations with the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) of @xmath4  gem .",
    "@xcite subsequently applied the technique to @xmath5  aql and , with additional data , to @xmath4  gem , again based on pti observations . @xcite",
    "have reported the measurement of the angular pulsations of seven galactic cepheids made with the european southern observatory s very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) and , in combination with spectroscopic data , have determined the distances to the cepheids .",
    "one of the prime programmes for which the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) @xcite was developed was the measurement of the mean diameters and angular pulsation amplitudes of cepheids but , in its initial configuration , it lacked the required sensitivity .",
    "the recent commissioning of a red beam - combination system in susi @xcite has resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity . in this paper",
    "we report susi measurements of the mean angular diameter and angular pulsation amplitude of @xmath0  car , one of the seven cepheids measured with the vlti by @xcite .",
    "a preliminary analysis was presented at a european southern observatory symposium in 2005 @xcite and @xcite has discussed the susi cepheid programme including an analysis of a subset of the @xmath0  car observations reported here .",
    "spectroscopic radial velocity measurements from the literature have been combined to produce a radial velocity versus pulsation phase curve and , after scaling with a fixed @xmath3-factor as discussed in section  [ sec : p - factor ] , this has been integrated to give the radial displacement of the cepheid surface as a function of pulsation phase . the radial displacement and limb - darkened angular diameter data have been combined to determine the distance and mean radius of @xmath0  car .    the resulting distance and mean radius are compared with values in the literature determined by the same technique and by the infrared surface brightness method and excellent agreement is found , particularly when all values are scaled to a common @xmath3-factor .",
    "although it might seem premature to discuss the pulsation phase prior to discussing the observations it is necessary to ensure that both interferometric and spectroscopic phases are synchronised since the epochs of the interferometric and spectroscopic observations do not overlap . a problem in the case of @xmath0  car is the fact that there is evidence that its period has undergone changes .",
    "@xcite reported that the period of @xmath0  car changed from 35.5318days prior to jd2440000 to 35.5513days .",
    "@xcite refined the szabados period , with additional photometry in 1990 , to 35.5443days and @xcite , based on photometry in 2002 , give a value of 35.5572days .",
    "@xcite have listed values back to 1901 and found in their own spectroscopic study of @xmath0  car from early 1991 to late 1996 that an increase in the period was evident although the uncertainties were large .",
    "the approach that we have adopted is as follows .",
    "since the largest body of radial velocity data available to us is the combined mount stromlo observatory ( mso ) and mount john university observatory ( mjuo ) observations analysed by @xcite and their phases are effectively based on the @xcite ephemeris , albeit with small adjustments to bring the early mjuo data into line with the mso data , we have adopted the @xcite ephemeris for the analysis of both interferometric and additional spectroscopic data .",
    "the adopted period is 35.5443@xmath10.0006days with 2447880.81@xmath10.10 the zero point of maximum light in heliocentric julian date .",
    "the phases of individual data points have been computed from the julian date of observation for both interferometric and spectroscopic data .    because of the variations in period it is found that there are small phase shifts between data sets taken at different epochs . the change in phase across",
    "any given data set as a result of adopting the shobbrook period rather than for example , that of @xcite , is negligible , and a small phase shift of the whole data set to bring it into alignment with the @xcite data is justified .",
    "details of the alignment of the different sets of data will be discussed when combining data and , in particular , spectroscopic data in section  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "measurements of the squared fringe visibility @xmath6 were made with susi @xcite using the red beam - combination system , which employs the fringe - scanning technique @xcite .",
    "this beam - combination system uses matched filters with a central wavelength of 700 nm and spectral bandwidth of 80 nm .",
    "the observations to determine the angular diameter of @xmath0  car were made with a baseline of 40 m with additional measurements at 5 m to enable the zero baseline value of @xmath6 to be checked .",
    "calibrators were selected as close in the sky as possible to @xmath0  car with the additional requirement of being minimally resolved .",
    "the limiting sensitivity of susi at 700 nm is @xmath7 + 5 which limited the choice of calibrators and compromise was necessary .",
    "the calibrators used are listed in table  [ tab : cals ] with their spectral types , adopted uniform - disk angular diameters , and angular distances from @xmath0  car .",
    "common calibrators were used throughout to eliminate the potential influence of calibrator diameters on the pulsation curve . the effective wavelength of observations of all three calibrators has been estimated to be 695.0@xmath12.0 nm following a similar analysis to that described by @xcite .",
    "the uniform - disk angular diameters have been determined from measurements made with the narrabri stellar intensity interferometer ( nsii ) @xcite and with the mark iii optical interferometer ( mark iii ) @xcite . in the case of @xmath8  car",
    "the value measured with the nsii has been adopted after correction from the limb - darkened angular diameter to the uniform - disk angular diameter using the appropriate correction factor for 695 nm interpolated from the tabulation of @xcite . in the absence of measured angular diameters for @xmath9 and s  car ,",
    "limb - darkened angular diameters have been determined by interpolation in a plot of nsii and mark iii limb - darkened angular diameters for unreddened visual magnitude @xmath10 versus ( @xmath11-@xmath12)@xmath13 for ( @xmath11-@xmath12)@xmath14 . the interpolated limb - darkened angular diameters have been corrected to the @xmath15 magnitudes of the stars and corrected for limb - darkening to give the uniform - disk angular diameters listed in table  [ tab : cals ] , again using appropriate correction factors interpolated from the tabulation of @xcite . the uncertainties in the uniform - disk angular diameters have been estimated from the scatter in the plot of limb - darkened angular diameters versus ( @xmath11-@xmath12)@xmath13 .",

    "have been combined quadratically .",
    "the value by @xcite using the be method , which succeeds the value by @xcite , has an unrealistic published uncertainty of @xmath14pc because systematic effects have not been taken into account .",
    "@xcite have shown that a systematic uncertainty of the order of @xmath13per cent should be taken into account for the surface brightness method and the uncertainty for the @xcite distance in table  [ tab : distance ] has been increased to include this additional uncertainty . it is noted that the values by @xcite using the ibw and irsb methods , and by @xcite by the irsb method , do not include an allowance for the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath3-factor adopted .",
    "the distance values in table  [ tab : distance ] that involve the @xmath3-factor have used different values to that adopted here and , while it is recognised that different values _ may _ be appropriate for different methods , a column has been added to the table with the distances scaled to a common value of @xmath3 = 1.30@xmath10.05 .",
    "the uncertainties associated with this column have been increased to combine quadratically the uncertainty in the @xmath3-factor with the published uncertainty where appropriate .",
    "the uncertainty in the value by @xcite has been increased further as @xcite included a smaller uncertainty in the @xmath3-factor ( @xmath12.5% ) in their evaluation of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "examination of the distances for the common @xmath3-factor show excellent agreement for all values .",
    "columns for the mean radius of @xmath0  car are included in table  [ tab : distance ] , one for the published values and one for a common @xmath3-factor , following the same approach as for the distance .",
    "the uncertainty in the limb - darkened angular diameter for the ibw determinations has been taken into account although it is negligible compared with the uncertainty in the distance . examination of the mean radii for the common @xmath3-factor also show excellent agreement for all values .    the mean total range in limb - darkened angular diameter has been taken from the curves fitted to limb - darkened angular diameter versus radial displacement for the two values of uniform - disk angular diameter for the calibrator @xmath9  car .",
    "it is 0.560@xmath10.018mas , which corresponds to 18.7@xmath19per cent of the mean stellar diameter .",
    "the measurement of the angular pulsations of cepheid variables and the combination with spectroscopically determined radial displacements of the stellar atmospheres was one of the key programmes for which susi was developed .",
    "only recently has adequate sensitivity been achieved for this programme to be undertaken and the first results are those for @xmath0  car presented here .    the angular pulsation of @xmath0  car has been measured with good cover in pulsation phase and careful attention has been paid to uncertainties in the measurements , in the adopted calibrator angular diameters , in the projected value of @xmath6 at zero baseline , and to systematic effects . a phase - dependent limb - darkening factor , to convert uniform - disk angular diameters to limb - darkened angular diameters ,",
    "was established based on kurucz model atmospheres and its use , rather than a fixed mean value for the limb - darkening factor , was justified for 696 nm .",
    "the resulting mean limb - darkened angular diameter is 2.990@xmath10.017mas ( i.e. @xmath10.6per cent ) with a maximum - to - minimum amplitude of 0.560@xmath10.018mas corresponding to 18.7@xmath10.6per cent in the mean stellar diameter .",
    "the projected value of @xmath6 at zero baseline shows no evidence at 696 nm of the circumstellar envelope observed in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands by @xcite .",
    "a radial displacement curve has been computed from carefully selected radial velocity measurements from the literature and this has been combined with the interferometric data to determine the mean radius and distance to @xmath0  car .",
    "the value for the distance is 525@xmath126pc and the mean radius is 169@xmath18@xmath2 .",
    "these values have been compared with values in the literature and excellent agreement is found , particularly when all values are reduced to a common @xmath3-factor .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath3-factor is a major contributor to the uncertainties in the distance and mean radius .",
    "the susi data may be useful in the future if @xmath0  car specific hydrodynamic spherical models are generated that consider the possibility of a phase - dependence of limb - darkening and the @xmath3-factor as discussed , for example , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to facilitate such possible applications the calibrated @xmath6 values may be obtained from the lead author ( jd ) .",
