    "the critical behavior of pure lattice gauge theories ( lgts ) at finite temperatures is well understood for non - abelian @xmath2 theories in various dimensions . in particular , the phase structure of a finite - temperature three - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) pure @xmath2 lgt with the standard wilson action is thoroughly investigated both for @xmath3 and for the large-@xmath4 limit ( see , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the transition is second order for @xmath3 and first order for @xmath5 . in the case of the @xmath6 gauge group ,",
    "most works agree that the transition is weakly first order .",
    "the deconfining transition in @xmath7 lgts belongs to the universality class of @xmath8 @xmath9 potts models .",
    "all these phase transitions are characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a @xmath10 global symmetry of the lattice action in the high - temperature deconfining phase .",
    "surprisingly , the situation is much less clear for the @xmath0 @xmath1 lgt .",
    "the present state of affairs can be briefly summarized as follows .",
    "@xmath0 theory was studied by parga using lagrangian formulation of the theory @xcite . at high temperatures",
    "the system becomes effectively two - dimensional , in particular the monopoles of the original @xmath1 gauge theory become vortices of the @xmath8 system .",
    "the partition function turns out to coincide ( in the leading order of the high - temperature expansion ) with the @xmath8 @xmath11 model in the villain representation .",
    "the @xmath11 model is known to have the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition of the infinite order @xcite . according to the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture",
    "the finite - temperature phase transition in the @xmath0 @xmath1 lgt should belong to the universality class of the @xmath8 xy model @xcite .",
    "this means , firstly that the global @xmath1 symmetry can not be broken spontaneously because of the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite and , consequently the local order parameter does not exist for this type of the phase transition .",
    "secondly , the correlation function of the polyakov loops ( which become spins of the @xmath11 model ) decreases with the power law at @xmath12 implying a logarithmic potential between heavy electrons @xmath13 where the @xmath14 is the distance between test charges .",
    "the critical index @xmath15 is known from the renormalization - group analysis of ref.@xcite and equals @xmath16 at the critical point of the bkt transition . for @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 one has @xmath19 \\ , \\label{pllowt}\\ ] ] where the correlation length @xmath20 and the critical index @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the critical indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 should be the same in the finite - temperature @xmath1 model if the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture holds in this case .",
    "the first numerical check of these predictions was performed on the lattices @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xcite .",
    "though authors of @xcite confirm the expected bkt nature of the phase transition , the reported critical index is almost three times larger of that predicted for the @xmath11 model , @xmath27 .",
    "more recent analytical and numerical studies of ref.@xcite indicate that at least on the anisotropic lattice in the limit of vanishing spatial coupling @xmath28 ( where space - like plaquettes are decoupled ) the @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge model exhibits the critical behavior similar to the @xmath11 spin model .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the isotropic model on the lattices up to @xmath29 and @xmath30 reveal that @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ still far from the @xmath11 value @xcite .",
    "thus , so far there is no numerical indications that critical indices of @xmath0 @xmath1 lgt coincide with those of the @xmath8 @xmath11 model and the question of the universality remains open if @xmath28 is non - vanishing .    on the analytical side",
    "one should mention a renormalization group ( rg ) study of refs.@xcite . in both cases a high - temperature and a dilute monopole gas approximations",
    "were used for the villain formulation which helped to derive an effective sine - gordon model .",
    "resulting rg equations were shown to converge rapidly with iterations to rg equations of the @xmath8 @xmath11 model .",
    "it gives a strong indication that , indeed the nature of the phase transitions in both models is the same .",
    "moreover , since the scaling of the lattice spacing coincides in both cases the critical index @xmath23 should also be the same ( this however was not proven ) .",
    "furthermore , neither critical points nor index @xmath22 has been determined in previous studies .    in this work",
    "we re - examine the critical behavior of the villain formulation of the @xmath0 @xmath1 lgt aiming to compute both critical indices @xmath23 and @xmath22 as well as to determine the location of the critical points . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we calculate the free energy of the model in the presence of a twist and express it like a function of a bare coupling , a monopole activity and adimensional ratio of the anisotropic couplings .",
    "varying the lattice cut - off one then finds the rg equations in a standard manner .",
    "we analyze the equations thus obtained for different values of @xmath32 . also , we present results for the correlation function of the polyakov loops which allow to extract the index @xmath22 at the critical point .",
    "we work on a periodic @xmath0 lattice @xmath33 with spatial extension @xmath34 and temporal extension @xmath32 .",
    "we introduce anisotropic dimensionless couplings as @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is lattice spacing in the time ( space ) direction , @xmath38 is the continuum coupling constant with dimension @xmath39 .",

    "perform duality transformations with the twisted partition function ; * replace the dual boltzmann weight with the villain formulation and calculate an effective monopole theory ; * sum up over monopole configurations in the dilute gas approximation .",
    "all these steps are well known in the context of the @xmath0 @xmath1 lgt and can be easily generalized for the anisotropic lattice in the presence of the twist . for the duality transformations we need an approach of ref .",

    "we find @xmath51 where the global summation over @xmath52 enforces the global bianchi constraint on the periodic system and @xmath53 is the dual partition function @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the modified bessel function and we have introduced sources @xmath56 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a set of links dual to twisted plaquettes ( this set forms a closed loop on the dual lattice ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the limit @xmath61 and in the absence of the twist the partition function ( [ dualpf_twist ] ) reduces to ( @xmath62 runs now over two - dimensional lattice @xmath63 ) @xmath64 in this limit the model becomes a generalized version of the @xmath11 model , and it was studied both analytically and by monte - carlo simulations in ref.@xcite .",
