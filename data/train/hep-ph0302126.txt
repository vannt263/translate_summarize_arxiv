    "the elastic neutrino - photon scattering process , @xmath0 , and the corresponding crossed channels have been the subject of numerous investigations related to astrophysical applications @xcite . when the center of mass energy @xmath2 is much less than the @xmath3-boson mass @xmath4 , the amplitudes for these processes have a relatively simple form .",
    "in particular , the forward helicity non - flip amplitudes for the elastic processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 with massless neutrinos can be expanded in powers of @xmath5 by making use of unitarity@xcite .",
    "the series are of leading order @xmath6 , and the inclusion of higher powers of @xmath7 , such as @xmath8 , enables us to use the forward elastic scattering amplitudes for @xmath0 and @xmath1 to study the optical activity of a sea of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "this property of a neutrino sea was recognized by nieves and pal @xcite and studied by mohanty , nieves , and pal @xcite in the case where the photons move in a plasma and therefore experience dispersion .",
    "dispersive effects give rise to mass dependent of terms of the form @xmath9 ( @xmath10 denoting the photon momentum and @xmath11 the electron mass ) , which vanish in the vacuum . here , we treat the vacuum case where @xmath10 satisfies @xmath12 , and find a rather different dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath11 @xcite .    in the next section , using the results of ref.@xcite , we write the forward helicity amplitudes for the elastic scattering @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we then present a calculation for the index of refraction and the rotary power for a sea of neutrinos and antineutrinos as a function of the energy of an incident photon , the temperature of the sea , and the neutrino degeneracy parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the chemical potential for neutrinos and @xmath15 is the temperature of the sea .",
    "using the eqs.(24)(26 ) of the ref.@xcite , the helicity non - flip amplitudes , @xmath16 , for the forward elastic scattering of a photon with helicity @xmath17 and an electron neutrino when @xmath18 , can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath21 is the weak mixing angle , @xmath22 is the fine structure constant , and we have neglected higher powers of @xmath23 and @xmath5 . using the eq.(12 ) of the ref.@xcite , the helicity non - flip amplitudes , @xmath24 , for forward elastic scattering of a photon of helicity @xmath17 and an antineutrino , can be expressed as @xmath25 which is a consequence of @xmath26 invariance .    to calculate the optical activity of a neutrino - antineutrino sea , we consider a photon of helicity @xmath17 and energy @xmath27 traversing a bath of neutrinos and antineutrinos that are in thermal equilibrium at the temperature @xmath15 . to give an order of magnitude estimate of the index of refraction @xmath28 of this sea",

    "these neutrino asymmetry parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined such that for @xmath50 they coincide with the customary definition of the neutrino asymmetry parameter @xmath51 @xcite for a sea of relic neutrino - antineutrino that decoupled from photons in the early universe @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the photon number density @xmath54 and the relation @xmath55 , which holds for the present day temperatures of the relic neutrinos and photons , is used .",

    "corresponds to a clockwise rotation ( dextrorotation ) of the plane of polarization of the linearly polarized incident photons , as viewed by an observer that is detecting the forward - scattered light .",
    "thus , the optical activity of a neutrino - antineutrino sea with @xmath94 is that of a dextrorotary medium .",

    "the size of specific rotary power in the dispersive case is independent of the frequency of the propagating photons and , apart from a dependence on the lepton asymmetry parameter @xmath111 shared by both expressions , is controlled by the electron number density @xmath109 .",
    "in addition , the non - dispersive case depends on frequency and temperature .",
