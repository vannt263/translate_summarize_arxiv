    "semiclassical approximations are of importance throughout physics in order to extract new effects or potentially observable phenomena in regimes in which quantum features are relevant but not dominant .",
    "all aspects of quantum gravity currently considered for potential tests fall in this class of situations . while deep quantum phases are crucial for several conceptual problems , the current developments remain so diverse that reliable conclusions are difficult to draw .",
    "semiclassical physics , on the other hand , is already useful for this class of theories in order to demonstrate their consistency with large - scale properties of the universe and to approach potential low - energy observations for instance via details of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "for this reason , the development of systematic semiclassical approximations is one of the major requirements in current quantum - gravity research , especially for approaches such as loop quantum gravity whose underlying principles do not make use of a continuum geometry and perturbations around it .    in loop quantum gravity and cosmology ,",
    "the main tool available at a dynamical level is that of effective equations which describe the evolution of expectation values in a dynamical state @xcite . as in most quantum systems ,",
    "especially interacting ones , quantum fluctuations , correlations and higher moments of the state then back - react on the evolution of expectation values , described in effective equations by coupling terms between classical and quantum degrees of freedom . with an infinite number of independent moments of a state ,",
    "there are infinitely many quantum degrees of freedom , making the general system of equations difficult to analyze . in semiclassical regimes",
    ", however , the infinite set of equations reduces to finite sets at any given order of the expansion by powers of @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", a systematic expansion arises that goes well beyond other examples such as the wkb approximation . to first order in @xmath0 and",
    "combined with a second - order adiabatic approximation , applied to anharmonic oscillators , equations equivalent to those of the low - energy effective action are produced when expanding around the ground state @xcite .",
    "( the more widely applied wkb approximation does not reproduce the low - energy effective action @xcite . ) for other systems and different states , on the other hand , the canonical methods developed in @xcite are more general and apply to quantum cosmology as well , even taking into account the totally constrained nature of these systems @xcite .",
    "one should thus expect that an application to quantum gravity allows comparisons with low - energy effective quantum gravity @xcite , but can also highlight new effects related to specific properties of quantum space - time structure as opposed to just graviton dynamics on a classical background .    compared with direct solution procedures of the partial differential equations that determine the dynamics of wave functions ,",
    "the procedure used here has the advantage of directly yielding expressions for expectation values and other , in principle observable quantities .",
    "the usual , but often numerically cost - intensive two - step procedure of first finding expressions for the wave function and then performing integrations to obtain expectation values is thus significantly reduced . in this context , the methods used and described are useful not just for quantum cosmology , the realm of our examples , but may find wider applicability . in quantum cosmology , or",
    "more generally constrained systems , other advantages include a possible extension to systems in which the dynamics is determined by a hamiltonian constraint , not a hamiltonian function @xcite , and a simplification of the problem of time in semiclassical regimes @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approximation allows one to consider most cases of interest in current quantum - gravity research , but they do not allow one to tackle all of them .",
    "for this reason it is of interest to analyze the system of equations obtained as more and more of the moments grow large and become relevant when a dynamical state turns more highly quantum . since such large numbers of variables coupled to each other by long evolution equations are difficult to handle analytically ( see the appendix for deterrence ) , the main aim of this article is to provide results of efficient computer - algebra codes designed to derive these equations automatically and quickly to high orders , which can then be fed into a numerical solver of the coupled differential equations . in this way",
    ", one can see how much high orders of the expansions matter and how higher moments can affect the evolution of expectation values as strong quantum regimes are approached .",
    "an interesting toy example for this is a spatially flat isotropic universe with a positive cosmological constant , filled with a homogeneous free and massless scalar field .",
    "the free scalar can play the role of a global internal time , allowing one to reformulate the constrained system as ordinary hamiltonian evolution . in the presence of a positive cosmological constant ,",
    "the value of the scalar field is bounded from above as a function of time ; thus , when using the scalar as internal time , infinite volume is reached at a finite time @xmath1 . as this point is approached , volume fluctuations and higher moments diverge even though the regime is supposed to be one of low - curvature nature ( see figure [ f : voldiverge ] ) .",
    "the non - semiclassical appearance is an artifact of the choice of time , highlighting the toy - nature of the model .",
    "physical conclusions derived from the model for a late - time universe with a positive cosmological constant can thus not be reliable , as interesting as they might be .",
    "but the model is ideal for a mathematical analysis of the possible roles of large moments . in the present article",
    ", we will use this example mainly to illustrate the usefulness of the numerical codes ; further analysis requires more sophisticated methods to handle the large parameter space of all moments .     for a cosmological constant @xmath2 and initial data to be presented in sec .",
    "[ s : highorder ] , together with the spread around this trajectory @xmath3 .",
    "this plot illustrates the growing dispersion of a state evolving to large volume .",
    "the range for @xmath4 shown , relative to the value @xmath1 at which the classical volume diverges , is the maximal one obtained with numerical stability to tenth order of moments of the evolving state . as the volume grows , the area swept out by the wave packet more and more aligns itself with the vertical axis , such that volume fluctuations ( as well as some other moments ) computed at a fixed value of @xmath4 diverge .",
    "this divergence would happen even if the state remained sharply peaked transversal to the direction in which it moves , and is thus not a failure of semiclassicality in this system but rather an artifact of the parametrization of evolution .",
    "physical implications are thus difficult to draw , but an interesting test case for back - reaction issues is obtained .",
    "[ f : voldiverge],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we begin with a brief review of the procedure of effective equations , followed by a correction of an important formula of @xcite and its accompanying proof .",
    "classically , the phase space of a system with one degree of freedom is completely described by the generalized position @xmath5 ( related to the volume in cosmological models ) and its conjugate momentum @xmath6 ( related to the hubble parameter ) . during the quantization process",
    "each classical phase - space function is promoted to an operator , and observable information is extracted via expectation values which can be seen as functionals on the algebra of operators that characterize states . since expectation values of products of operators in general differ from products of expectation values , the following infinitely many moments are needed to describe the system completely : @xmath7 where the subscript weyl stands for totally symmetric ordering .",
    "moments can not be chosen arbitrarily but are subject to additional conditions such as the uncertainty relation @xmath8 moreover , a set of moments satisfying all those conditions in general corresponds to a mixed rather than pure state . by considering moments to describe states , mixing ( which is important for generic descriptions of homogeneous quantum cosmology seen as an averaged description of microscopic physics , in particular inhomogeneities )",
    "is automatically included .",
    "the use of moments allows a very general definition of semiclassical states as those satisfying the @xmath0ierarchy @xmath9 , realized for gaussian states ( see below ) but also for a much wider class .",
    "this characterization of semiclassical states ( pure or mixed ) has two major advantages : ( i ) it is a general characterization , as unbiased as possible .",
    "( in more restrictive classes such as gaussians the specific form of the wave function may actually matter for physical effects . )",
    "( ii ) the infinitely many @xmath10 are decomposed in finite sets to order @xmath11 .",
    "this feature allows systematic approximations of semiclassical dynamics .",
    "the moments are pure quantum degrees of freedom ; they would all vanish in a classical limit . in a quantized interacting system they couple to the expectation values @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the state with respect to which these moments are taken is specified via values for all the quantum variables , which are all dynamical and satisfy equations of motion . in order to consider the evolution of expectation values",
    ", the evolution of all moments must be followed simultaneously . assuming the moments to be constant or to take specific values such as",
    ", for instance , those of a gaussian state at all times can not provide the correct dynamics .",
    "the dynamics is described by a quantum hamiltonian , the expectation value of the hamiltonian operator , which is state dependent and thus a function of expectation values and all the moments . by taylor expansion , one can write the quantum hamiltonian as @xmath14 with the classical hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "the quantum variables it contains provide crucial corrections to the classical dynamics in a state - dependent way .",
    "we note that expansions of this form ( as also the feynman or wkb expansions ) are expected to be asymptotic , not necessarily convergent . in the model discussed below",
    ", we will nevertheless observe strong convergence properties within a large range of orders .",
    "the evolution generated by the quantum hamiltonian @xmath16 , governed by the equations of motion @xmath17 for phase - space functions @xmath18 , is described with respect to a time parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this could be an absolute time parameter or , as in the example used below , an internal time variable chosen for a deparameterizable constrained system .",
    "( for the effective treatment of non - deparameterizable constrained systems , lacking a global internal time , see @xcite . )",
    "effective quantum evolution then provides an approximation scheme for time - dependent expectation values of operators , starting with some initial state specified by the initial expectation values and moments .",
    "it is straightforward to find moments corresponding to a wave - function representation of the initial state in a hilbert space , such as the schrdinger one .",
    "moments evolved by the quantum hamiltonian then correspond to the dynamical state , evolved in the schrdinger or heisenberg picture .",
    "we are thus guaranteed that at all times , as long as the evolved moments remain finite , there is still a corresponding wave function with those moments to within the order of approximation considered .",
    "it may be difficult to construct such a wave function explicitly , but this is not required because the information relevant for observations is already contained in the expectation values and moments .",
    "( when moments diverge , as in the example discussed below , the state moves out of the domain of definition of the operators considered . by our moment expansions we will only consider the approach to such a point of divergence , not the point itself . )    in order to obtain all hamiltonian equations of motion in the context of this effective approach , we will need to compute the poisson brackets between any two moments . if one defines the poisson bracket for expectation values of arbitrary operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 by the relation @xmath21\\rangle$ ] ( extended to arbitrary functions of expectation values using linearity and the leibniz rule ) , hamiltonian equations of motion generated by @xmath22 are equivalent to the schrdinger flow of states or the heisenberg flow of operators . by applying this relationship to all powers of the basic operators ,",
    "the poisson brackets between moments is obtained . since @xmath23=i\\hbar$ ] , in the particular case of the basic operators themselves , the poisson bracket reduces to the classical one , @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , one can easily show that moments have vanishing poisson brackets with the basic expectation values : @xmath25    the general case of poisson brackets between moments is more involved .",
    "we have the general formula @xmath26 where the sum over @xmath27 runs over all odd numbers from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , which makes the coefficients real in spite of the presence of the imaginary unit .",
    "we have also defined @xmath30 where the @xmath31-coefficients come from the weyl ordering ( see also sec .  [",
    "s : algimp ] ) and are defined as @xmath32 note that these coefficients have the permutation property @xmath33 . since the sum in ( [ ggbrackets ] ) is only over odd @xmath27 , this makes the antisymmetry of the poisson brackets transparent .",

    "this typo is corrected in ( [ ggbrackets ] ) , and since the formula plays an important role for the results of this article , we provide a detailed proof in the following subsection .      as in @xcite",

    "we then obtain the poisson bracket between our quantum variables . making the convenient substitutions",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , and combining the factorials into binomial coefficients the result reads , @xmath52 finally we make the replacement @xmath53 , noting that in the summation over @xmath54 the only non - zero terms occur when @xmath55 , which gives us ( [ ggbrackets ] ) .",
    "we have written two different codes in _ mathematica _ in order to obtain the poisson brackets between any two generic moments .",
    "the first code works iteratively , whereas the second one makes use of the general formula ( [ ggbrackets ] ) .",
    "the results agree for all orders checked ( up to 14th ) but the second code is much more efficient .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ timing ] , where we have plotted the timing of both codes to compute several poisson brackets .",
    "the timing of the recursive code increases exponentially with the order of the considered poisson bracket , whereas the general code allows us to obtain high - order results in a very short time .",

    "there are @xmath59 different moments with an order less or equal to @xmath27 , where the subtraction of 3 comes from the fact that the order 0 and 1 moments are trivial ; they can be combined into @xmath60 different poisson brackets . in the case of the recursive ( general ) code , the 33 ( 228 ) moments up to order seven ( 20 ) have been considered , and in the plot the timing for their corresponding 561 ( 26106 ) independent poisson brackets are drawn.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the following we briefly explain how the recursive code works .",
    "making use of the binomial identity , the expression for the moments can be written as , @xmath61 on the other hand , we also have found that the weyl ordering can be given as a linear combination of expectation values with a predefined order , for any operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64^d\\ , c_{kn}^{d}\\ , \\langle\\hat   a^{k - d } \\hat b^{n - d}\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath65 have been defined in ( [ c ] ) .",

    "in the approach to the divergence of @xmath5 , correction terms should become relevant one by one , depending on their moment order .",

    "one may conjecture that , with all quantum corrections from the complete series of moments , the divergence of @xmath5 would disappear .",

    "while subtle issues of self - adjoint extensions of operators usually do not play a large role in effective equations , provided that consistent truncations are possible , the point where @xmath5 diverges classically requires all moments to be taken into account . with infinitely many independent variables , coupling terms have to be arranged in a precise manner , which can reflect issues of self - adjoint extensions . when all moments are taken into account in a way corresponding to unitary evolution of the corresponding wave function , well - defined equations for expectation values and the moments may result .",
    "this supports the conjecture that the classical divergence might be removed by an interplay of all moments , but a verification in this highly coupled system is complicated .",
    "( it could , in fact , happen that wave functions evolve out of the domain of definition of the unbounded operator @xmath146 , and then directly re - enter .",
    "thus , it is not obvious that equations for expectation values @xmath147 must be well - defined at all times . another example which indicates caution against applying arguments of self - adjointness for the behavior of expectation values is the upside - down harmonic oscillator . its hamiltonian is not essentially self - adjoint and allows different self - adjoint extensions , depending on the boundary conditions at infinity where wave packets are reflected .",
    "however , the hamiltonian is also quadratic , and no quantum back - reaction results .",
    "effective equations are automatically truncated without implementing any approximation ; the evolution of moments to finite order just does not depend on what self - adjoint extension is used . )",
    "we will probe the divergence of @xmath5 further by the numerics of high - order moments .",
    "for now , conclusions one can draw already from the analysis presented so far are :    * quantum back - reaction is essential at large volume in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , even though one would expect it to be a semiclassical regime of small curvature if @xmath90 is small . * while a wave packet in a @xmath5-representation may not show large deviations from the classical trajectory , this is only because volume fluctuations grow and are larger than deviations from the classical trajectory .",
    "nevertheless , as volume fluctuations diverge , deviations from the classical trajectory can be large .",
    "equations including quantum back - reaction clearly show that correction terms can not be ignored .",
    "quantum back - reaction seems to strengthen the divergence of @xmath5 rather than triggering a recollapse .",
    "* corrections are more visible for curvature @xmath6 since its fluctuations approach zero while also here quantum back - reaction terms in the equations of motion are relevant .",
    "thus , deviations from the classical trajectory build up and , unlike for @xmath5 , are not covered by a broad wave function if a @xmath6-representation is used .",
    "* all state parameters matter for the spreading behavior and for the exact size of quantum corrections . a state may be assumed to be unsqueezed initially , setting @xmath148 , but correlations will build up over time .      at third or higher orders , the equations of motion not only become longer ; there is also a new feature in the poisson relations which we illustrate here .",
    "some examples of third - order moments are @xmath149 the poisson brackets of second - order with third - order moments are of third - order form , for instance : @xmath150 where only the ones needed for evolution in our cosmological system were written .",
    "two third - order moments in a poisson bracket , on the other hand , show a different behavior : they produce a term of higher order ( fourth ) as well as products of second - order moments , which are to be considered as being of fourth order in the @xmath0ierarchy .",
    "this behavior of the poisson structure has consequences for the truncation of equations of motion .",
    "unlike for second order , ( [ poissonsecond ] ) , there is a difference between expanding the hamiltonian to third order and then deriving equations of motion , and expanding the equations of motion ( obtained from an expanded hamiltonian or the whole series in @xmath0 ) to third order . in particular ,",
    "moments of third order in the hamiltonian produce moments of fourth order in the equations of motion for third order moments .",
    "this would result in a complete set if also equations of motion for fourth order moments are included .",
    "this problem does not arise if one first computes equations of motion and expands those to third ( or any ) order which is anyway more suitable because it is the equations of motion which we are primarily interested in .",
    "we illustrate this feature by the following evolution equations , computed from the third - order hamiltonian :    @xmath151    if we truncate the hamiltonian ( and hence the equations of motion ) to a given order , the equations of motion for quantum variables involve higher order moments , as shown in the following equations to third order in moments ,    @xmath152    for consistency of the approximation one should eliminate in this third - order approximation all terms of quartic order , i.e.fourth-order moments , producing a closed set of equations .",
    "( one may eliminate terms quadratic in second - order moments as well , but they are anyway subdominant when the @xmath0ierarchy is satisfied . ) truncating only the hamiltonian to third order is thus not enough because the general poisson bracket between two third - order moments produces terms of fourth order .",
    "( in general , the poisson bracket of two moments of order @xmath27 and @xmath153 , respectively , produces terms of order @xmath154 [ see eq .",
    "( [ ggbrackets ] ) ] . only for second order",
    "does this result in a closed poisson algebra . )",
    "consistently truncated equations of motion are produced if one truncates the hamiltonian as well as the poisson brackets to the order considered .",
    "an example to order five can be found in the appendix .      because of the complicated structure of the equations at higher orders , analyzing them by analytical meanings is very hard .",
    "hence we need to resort to numerical methods .",
    "in particular , in this subsection we will numerically solve the evolution equations , derived using computer algebra , up to 10th order .",
    "an important question is then what values to choose for all the 63 moments involved at initial time @xmath155 . here",
    "we will simply choose the initial state corresponding to an unsqueezed gaussian pulse in the volume , @xmath156 while this state is very special in the space of all semiclassical moments , it already serves well to demonstrate several features of quantum evolution .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the large parameter space will appear elsewhere .    using ( [ defg ] ) , the initial moments are then given by , @xmath157 where @xmath158 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "this integral can be performed and happens to be vanishing except in those cases for which both @xmath37 and @xmath159 are even numbers , @xmath160 this state saturates the uncertainty relation , and we have that @xmath161 , so the moments satisfy the semiclassical @xmath0ierarchy . in our simulations , however , we have used @xmath162 in order to make implications for the behavior of back - reaction more clearly visible .",
    "nevertheless , the features we point out have been verified also for smaller values of @xmath0 .    by this choice of initial values",
    ", the many - parameter family of all moments up to a given order is thus reduced to a 1-parameter family labeled by the volume spread @xmath163 . from this perspective , choosing a gaussian initial state seems rather special and arbitrary ; it is distinguished only by the simplicity of writing down a wave function .",
    "as the system evolves , the state will depart from gaussian behavior , a property which can easily be seen by following the behavior of the moments . before discussing the numerical results in this direction , we note that the choice of gaussian moments as initial values can sometimes be dangerous also for numerical purposes .",
    "a gaussian state saturates the uncertainty relations , and numerical errors may easily move the evolved moments to the wrong side of saturation . depending on the dynamical system , the saturation surface may be unstable such that uncertainty relations may be violated after some stretch of numerical evolution , which at that stage could no longer be trusted .",
    "( see also @xcite for a discussion of similar issues in small - volume regimes . ) in the numerical evolutions shown here , the fact that uncertainty relations are maintained has explicitly been tested by monitoring the relevant combinations of the second - order moments .",
    "in particular , the final time of each evolution has been chosen as the last time where the convergence tests are obeyed .    once an unsqueezed gaussian is chosen as initial state , the only choice left is the value of @xmath163 .",
    "the system under consideration has no ground state , and thus there is no preferred value for @xmath163 as for instance the harmonic oscillator would suggest . for small initial fluctuations , which are related to @xmath163 by @xmath164 , we just require that @xmath165 is satisfied for the initial values .",
    "specifically , in all evolutions presented in this paper we take @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "this does not represent a high restriction since we have also performed numerical simulations for different larger values of the width ( @xmath169 ) and the qualitative picture is not changed .",
    "even so , the behavior of the system for values of @xmath170 is completely different . in this case",
    "the corrections to the classical trajectories are very large from the very beginning and the approximation can not be regarded as valid .",
    "this happens because in the evolution equations ( [ dotv ] ) and ( [ dotp ] ) , the moments @xmath171 and @xmath172 appear . at the initial time",
    "@xmath97 the former is zero , whereas the latter is of the order @xmath173 for even @xmath27 and vanishing for odd @xmath27 .",
    "hence , for very small @xmath163 , the initial time derivatives of @xmath5 and @xmath6 increase much with the considered order .",
    "this entails a completely different trajectory for the classical objects at each order and thus the approximation breaks down .     at each order for @xmath2 .",
    "the lowest trajectory corresponds to the classical one .",
    "the values are increasing with the considered order in such a way that the largest trajectory is obtained at 10th order . for a more detailed analysis of the convergence ,",

    "[ 2ndorder ] , several questions about the evolution of states has been suggested by the second - order analysis , but could not be answered without more general information about the high - order system of quantum back - reaction . with the numerical results",
    ", we can now provide additional indications regarding quantum evolution , but also new properties become visible .    first , the strong increase of some of the moments already seen at second order is confirmed .",
    "the system is thus necessarily one of strong quantum back - reaction .",
    "results about self - adjoint extensions of quantum hamiltonians have suggested that the evolution can be continued through the classical divergence of the volume .",
    "the only intuitive semiclassical interpretation would be that quantum corrections become so strong that they can trigger a recollapse .",
    "our numerical results to the orders specified do not provide any indication for this ; they rather show that the divergence is enhanced by quantum corrections .",
    "the behavior of the moments confirms two expectations about state evolution .",
    "first , several moments grow and become dominant providing strong quantum back - reaction .",
    "secondly , the state rapidly departs from the initially chosen gaussian moments .",
    "while it is difficult to reconstruct a wave function from the moments , it is clear from several of their properties that the state can not remain gaussian . a gaussian state has vanishing moments of odd order , a property which is immediately violated once",
    "the state is evolved . as the rapid initial increase of the odd - order moments shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] shows , the evolution quickly adapts the state to one whose moments change less severely . to some degree ,",
    "even the special choice of a gaussian state may not be much of a restriction since the evolution soon leads to a more suitable dynamical state .",
    "however , for robust conclusions about quantum evolution from a fixed set of initial values one must analyze how the state settled down to depends on the initial moments .",
    "if different sets of initial moments still lead to adapted states , but ones that differ from the gaussian adapted state in a way sensitive to the initial set , the quantum behavior would be hard to predict without knowledge of what state may be preferred . here ,",
    "much more numerical analysis of the large parameter space involved is necessary .",
    "finally , we see from figures such as figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] that a hierarchy of the moments is maintained for a rather long time even throughout the phase of dynamically adapting the state .",
    "moments of different orders clearly fall into distinct classes as for their behavior of decay or increase",
    ". only when moments of different orders converge , which interestingly happens in a very narrow time frame for all orders shown , will the hierarchy be broken .",
    "at such a point , the state can no longer be considered semiclassical , and truncations of the infinite system of effective equations ( and the asymptotic expansion they represent ) become more difficult to justify in general terms . nevertheless , in our specific case ,",
    "even when the state is no longer of recognizably semiclassical form , the truncation is still justified by the convergence analysis we perform in app .",
    "[ convergence ] .",
    "we have also shown the evolution even after that time of accumulation because it indicates another feature .",
    "after the accumulation , the moments again separate into clearly demarcated sets , indicating that another hierarchy arises .",
    "however , since one has to evolve through an anhierarchical point , it is not clear whether this feature is one of the full system or an artifact of the truncation .",
    "finally and somewhat unexpectedly , the hierarchy is maintained longer for larger values of the cosmological constant , even though the deviation from the harmonic model is then stronger .",
    "the main contribution of this article is the introduction of a new computational method to analyze quantum back - reaction of quantum mechanical or quantum cosmological systems .",
    "we have shown that the use of efficient computer algebra tools in combination with the closed formula for the poisson brackets of two generic moments has been essential to push the feasibility of computations to very high order .",
    "in particular , the example we have studied of a spatially flat , isotropic universe with a positive cosmological constant and a free , massless scalar field already indicates the usefulness of these methods .",
    "our analysis has found several new properties of state evolution , some of which were quite unexpected .",
    "for example , the state rapidly deviates from the initial gaussian form ( in the volume ) , but then settles down to another shape obeying a hierarchy of the moments . in this range",
    ", truncations used to analyze effective equations remain justified . at some point ,",
    "the moments converge , interestingly at about the same time .",
    "several properties found here remain without an analytical explanation , stimulating further studies .",
    "for instance , somewhat counterintuitively , the moments happen to `` slow down '' their evolution as the value of the cosmological constant increases .",
    "that is , qualitatively they follow the same pattern , independently of @xmath90 , but everything happens later for large values of the cosmological constant .",
    "another interesting feature comes from the evolution of the initially non - vanishing moments @xmath179 : at late times they accumulate at a common value for each index @xmath194 .    on the other hand , we have also studied the convergence of this truncated system of equations with respect to the order ( see app . [ convergence ] ) by analyzing the relative error in the trajectory of the expectation value of the volume @xmath5 . remarkably , even though a priori we expect only asymptotic rather than convergent expansions , the results converge exponentially for all considered times within a large range of orders .",
    "this means that our results reliably reproduce the full quantum behavior of the system even quite near the divergence .",
    "finally , details of the numerics remain to be explored , most importantly those related to the large parameter space involved .",
    "for instance , it is not clear yet how strong the role of the choice of an initial state is .",
    "the shape of the state changes rapidly in a very brief initial phase , as shown by a large change in the moments , and then settles down to a form better conserved by the dynamics .",
    "this evolved state seems adapted to the dynamics , but it is not known at present whether differently chosen initial states will give rise to the same kind of dynamically evolving state , nor is it known whether the initial choice could influence the dynamics strongly . for such questions ,",
    "the parametrization by moments , rather than wave functions , is important because it gives full access to the state space .",
    "for instance , one could use a random number generator to construct the initial moments just by restricting to those sets that obey the schwartz inequalities .",
    "this will provide a systematic control to map the whole state space , which would not be achievable by specifying explicit wave functions .",
    "( of course , one could randomize the coefficients of wave functions in some basis , but the observable meaning of those variations would be much less clear than changes of moments . ) probing the large parameter space of the initial state is the main problem in this context which will benefit from further numerical support . the results of this paper thus show that quantum cosmology provides its own set of problems which are interesting from a numerical perspective , whose solution will then give feedback for the specific form of the dynamics realized .",

    "the existence of a @xmath0ierarchy on the moments define a semiclassical regime where the truncation of the system into a finite number of moments makes sense .",
    "but , since we have obtained the numerical solution of the system of equations at different orders , another method is at our hand to check whether the ignored moments are indeed negligible , namely to analyze if the difference between the expectation values at different order decreases sufficiently fast .    in order to do so",
    ", we define the relative error at order @xmath27 as , @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the expectation value at order @xmath27 .",
    "if this object is convergent sufficiently fast with @xmath27 , it gives an estimate of the total relative error ( @xmath236 ) committed when truncating the system at a given order @xmath27 .",
    "even though we did not write it explicitly , the object @xmath228 is time ( @xmath4 ) dependent and , in fact , we expect it to increase ( and eventually not to converge ) as we approach the regime of large moments .",
    "hence we have chosen three different times to perform the convergence tests : @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the final time of each numerical evolution and takes the value @xmath241 for @xmath175 , @xmath242 for @xmath176 , and @xmath243 for @xmath178 .",
    "these convergence tests are shown in fig .",
    "[ conv ] in a natural logarithmic scale .",
    "firstly , we note that the convergence is exponential in all the cases and for all considered times . therefore , we have performed linear regressions for all the data .",
    "as expected , the magnitude of the errors increases for later times in all cases .",
    "even so , surprisingly for the first two plots , the convergence is faster at those times .",
    "the numerical value of the errors is also increasing with the value of @xmath90 .",
    "for instance , the relative errors of the classical solutions ( @xmath244 ) are of the order @xmath245 for large @xmath2 , whereas for small @xmath175 they are only of order @xmath246 .",
    "this gives an idea of the magnitude of the back reaction in each case .",
    "on the other hand , we see that our result at @xmath247th order mimics very accurately the behavior of the whole quantum system , in the sense of an asymptotic expansion",
    ". in particular , the largest error we find corresponds to the large cosmological constant case at late times ( @xmath239 ) and it is of the order of @xmath248 .",
    "note that in the last plot of fig .",
    "[ conv ] ( and also in the second one , but less severe so ) even and odd orders show different convergence behaviors .",
    "this observation demonstrates that moments of odd orders continue to contribute less significantly to the volume expectation value than moments of even order , even after the state has evolved away from gaussian form for which odd - order moments vanish .",
    "[ for odd @xmath27 , the expectation values in the ratio @xmath249 in ( [ error ] ) differ by even - order moments , and the errors are seen to be enlarged in the plots . ]",
    "this analysis proves that our treatment provides a valid approximation at all considered times , a result which strengthens the motivation to study this general approach .",
