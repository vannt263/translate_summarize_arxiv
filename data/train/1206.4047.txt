    "the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies is a central topic to the study of galaxy evolution .",
    "it is generally agreed that the sfr density of the universe has declined by an order of magnitude since @xmath7 to the present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the exact epoch of the peak of the sfr history is not known precisely , although it appears to be constrained to be within @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at this redshift range ,",
    "the primary sfr indicators are based on infrared ( ir ) , optical , and extinction - corrected ultraviolet ( uv ) observations ; the resulting sfr estimates commonly disagree with each other by more than a factor of two ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of star formation at these redshifts is known to occur in optically extincted star - forming regions in ir luminous galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the uncertainties resulting from the extinction undermine our ability to understand the sfr history during this era . a better understanding of the sfr history will have important implications on the cosmic stellar mass build - up and metal production .",
    "for example , there is a significant discrepancy between the expected metal abundance derived from the sfr history and the observed abundance @xcite , with some studies indicating the difference to be nearly an order of magnitude , and as a result placing the peak of the sfr history as far back as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the situation necessitates more efforts into exploring the nature of optical extinction in high redshift galaxies using unbiased measures as well as studying the effect of extinction on various sfr indicators .",
    "extinction measurements based on optical emission lines could be biased in highly obscured environments because the indicator only probes the outer layer of the star - forming regions , where the extinction is relatively low .",
    "this effect is observed locally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but only because observations are available for longer wavelength ir recombination lines ( e.g. pa@xmath1 and br@xmath1 ) that are less affected by extinction . in this work",
    ", we extend this technique out to @xmath10 by comparing the strength of the h@xmath1 line with those of pa@xmath1 and br@xmath1 .",
    "since the latter are in wavelength regions with @xmath11 times less extinction than h@xmath1 , they provide a measurement of extinction through the entire star - forming region . with an unbiased estimate of extinction",
    ", we can address its effects on sfr indicators in this critical redshift range .    in this paper , we study a wide range of star formation diagnostics in seven gravitationally lensed star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 . we observed four of these galaxies spectroscopically with the lucifer1 near - ir imaging spectrograph on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) to measure the h@xmath1 line flux in the near - ir , and with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , @xmath12 @xmath5 ) on the _ spitzer _ space telescope to observe the wavelength regions covering pa@xmath1 and/or br@xmath1 lines as well as aromatic emission lines and emission complexes ( commonly attributed to , and hereafter , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or pah ) .",

    "our galaxies were also observed with the mips instrument @xcite on _ spitzer _ at 24 and 70 @xmath5 by @xcite , allowing us to combine the mips data with far - ir photometry from the literature to estimate sfr via  obtained by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) across the peak of the far - ir emission .",

    ", we have reproduced the /@xmath146(pa@xmath147 ) ratio measured by papovich et al . using our reduction technique for abell 2218a , log[/@xmath146(pa@xmath147 ) ] = @xmath151 , and also found that the ratio for abell 1835a and the 8 oclock arc are @xmath152 dex lower than the @xcite relationship .",
    "this is consistent with the result in table [ table_derivedqn ] that the @xcite single - band 24 @xmath5  indicator yields  values agreeing with the far - ir sed - fitted , which implies that these galaxies have extended star formation ( see section [ sec : result_lir ] for details of the indicator ) .",
    "that is , the local relationship of @xmath146(pa@xmath147 ) and  reported by @xcite could have limited applicability at high redshift because the pa@xmath1 line will systematically have lower extinction for a given  due to the extended structure of star formation .",
    "all the other indicators give consistent estimates , within the expected errors of @xmath153 dex .",
    "we found that the h@xmath1 +  indicator by @xcite tends toward a smaller value of sfr at large extinctions or large , particularly above @xmath154 , as observed in abell 1835a and the 8 oclock arc .",
    "the sfr estimates from the 6.2 @xmath5 pah emission do not show a systematic trend with , although the scatter is larger than with other indicators .",
    "the scatter for individual galaxies is @xmath6 0.2 dex , similar to the scatter of  values we have found in @xcite at redshifts where the 24 @xmath5 band probes the pah emissions . since these are high s",
    "/ n measurements of an individual ( i.e. relatively non - blended ) pah emission line , this result suggests that the @xcite sfr indicator has succeeded in correcting for the sed evolution .",
    "we observed four strongly gravitationally lensed star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 with _ spitzer_/irs and the lbt / lucifer to obtain the mid - ir and near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "these observations are targeted to cover ir recombination lines , including h@xmath1 in the near - ir and pa@xmath1 or br@xmath1 in the mid - ir .",

    "our sample spans the redshift range of @xmath155 and the  range of @xmath156  to @xmath157 .",
    "the ir recombination line ratios are used to measure extinction that can probe deep into the highly obscured star - forming regions and thus provide an unbiased measure of extinction under the foreground screen assumption .",
    "independently , we estimate the extinction by comparing the optical and ir sfrs , a method that does not make the foreground screen assumption .",
    "the results from the two methods are consistent in three out of four galaxies with good ir recombination line flux measurements , suggesting that the dust extinction in these galaxies is consistent with a foreground screen ( i.e. uniform dust distribution ) .",
    "however , in the fourth case , the extinction estimates from two methods disagree by 1.8 mag , indicating a deviation from the uniform dust screen assumption , which suggests an inhomogeneous dust mixture .",
    "the extinction range of our sample ( assuming a foreground screen ) is @xmath158 mag , which is a larger spread than previously known for intermediate and high redshift galaxies based on measurements with optical emission lines .",
    "these results suggest a large diversity in both the extinction levels and dust distribution scenarios at high redshift .",
    "we compare the performance of various sfr indicators over the extinction range and find that substantial extinction corrections are required for the h@xmath1-based sfr indicator .",
    "the remaining indicators ( 1 ) combined h@xmath1 and ; ( 2 ) ; and ( 3 ) pah ( 6.2 @xmath5 ) all give estimates consistent to within the expected uncertainties of @xmath159 dex .",
