    "inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) is a process of energy production obtained from the nuclear fusion reaction between deuterium ( d ) and tritium ( t ) ions .",
    "it is a promising and abundant energy source for future power plants .",
    "the fusion reactions @xmath1mev take place in a hot and dense plasma compressed and heated by intense laser radiation .",
    "the thermonuclear burn of the deuterium - tritium ( dt ) fuel is supported by energetic @xmath0-particles , which are created by fusion reactions at the energy 3.52mev .",
    "those suprathermal particles subsequently transfer their energy to the fresh fuel through coulomb collisions .    in the case of inertial confinement fusion @xcite",
    ", a spherical dt shell is compressed to densities of the order of a few hundred g / cc by the ablation pressure .",
    "fusion reactions start in a central zone characterized by a density @xmath2g.@xmath3 and a high  ignition `` temperature @xmath4kev .",
    "the surrounding shell is 10 times colder than the hot spot ( @xmath5kev ) .",
    "the density of the central ' ' hot spot  is such that the mean free path @xmath6 of fast @xmath0-particles is roughly equal to the hot spot radius @xmath7@xcite .",
    "this allows the self - heating of the hot spot fuel which serves as a spark that subsequently burns the surrounding colder and denser shell .",
    "the design of icf targets and the interpretation of icf experiments rely on numerical simulations based on hydrodynamic lagrangian codes where kinetic effects are only considered as corrections included in the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the fluid description is relevant if the mean free path of plasma particles , namely electrons and ions , is smaller than the characteristic length scale .",
    "although this condition is reasonably fulfilled during the implosion stage , it does not apply to fast particles , in particular to fusion products near the ignition threshold .",
    "thus , an accurate kinetic modeling is required .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to propose an ion - kinetic description of suprathermal fusion products , treated self - consistently with the ion - kinetic modeling of the thermal imploding plasma .",
    "the difficulty lies in the coupling of ion populations characterized by two different energy scales :    * thermal particles @xmath8,@xmath9 , which form the bulk of the imploding plasma and whose kinetic energy is in the kev range . *",
    "suprathermal @xmath0-particles , created at 3.52 mev by fusion reactions .",
    "such a strong disparity in energy scales makes it difficult to build viable kinetic models of fusion reactions .",
    "existing ion kinetic codes can describe the implosion of dt targets in sub - ignition conditions @xcite , but the energy release from the fusion reactions is not accounted for in a self - consistent manner . several simplified methods compatible with hydrodynamic codes have been developed .",
    "haldy and ligou @xcite apply the moment method to model ion energy deposition in a hot and dense homogeneous plasma , but only a stationary case has been considered . a variety of methods based on diffusion models applied to charged - particle transport problems have also been developed .",
    "those methods are of considerable interest , since results on energy deposition profiles can be obtained with a low computational effort .",
    "nevertheless , diffusion methods rely on the assumption that the fast particle mean free path is smaller than the characteristic scale length of the energy deposition zone .",
    "this hypothesis does not hold for a typical icf target near ignition .",
    "corman et al @xcite derive a multi - group diffusion model from the fokker - planck equation to describe fast ion transport in a fusion plasma .",
    "however , they introduce heuristically a flux limiter in order to prevent unphysical behavior when particle flux approaches the free - streaming limit . pomraning @xcite develops a more sophisticated flux limiter scheme based on the chapman - enskog expansion . however , the flux limited diffusion smoothes artificially energy deposition profiles , especially in situations where ion sources are localized @xcite .",
    "this may lead to significant errors in the calculation of ignition thresholds and energy gains .",
    "such diffusion models are employed in all major present - day fluid codes because of their compatibility with the underlying hydrodynamic module .",
    "several exact methods can be employed to solve the fokker - planck equation in a general way , but they are too much time consuming .",
    "monte carlo algorithms are applied to model charged particle transport in refs .",

    "distribution functions are represented by a sum of dirac measures .",
    "monte carlo particles are characterized by their numerical weight , their position and their velocity .",
    "those quantities evolve in time according to the vlasov - fokker - planck equation while the tracking of monte carlo particles is performed through the spatial mesh .",
    "the accuracy of monte carlo methods is proportional to @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the number of monte carlo particles , so that @xmath12 and variance reduction techniques are usually employed to reduce numerical noise .",
    "a significant deficiency of monte carlo methods for the investigation of kinetic effects is that the tails of the distribution functions are not described accurately .",
    "moreover , the coupling between suprathermal particles and the thermal bulk is usually treated in a rough manner , by removing the suprathermal particles that are slowed down below a given energy threshold and injecting the removed particles in the thermal bulk .",
    "therefore , the thermalization process is not described with a sufficient precision .",
    "@xmath13 methods are also used to solve the fokker - planck equation deterministically .",
    "they are based on the determination of the angular flux of suprathermal particles at a set of discrete directions , each one associated with a quadrature weight @xcite .",
    "although they are more accurate than diffusion methods and can be extended to highly anisotropic particle distribution functions , the weakly collisional limit is not described accurately and the thermalization process is treated approximately with the same strategy as in monte carlo methods .",

    "we develop a kinetic modeling of suprathermal fusion products in the thermal imploding plasma .",
    "we extend the existing code fpion @xcite so as to treat @xmath0-particles , for which _ two scales of energy _ are considered , namely a suprathermal and a thermal one .",
    "since the developments made to reach this goal have been substantial , they have actually lead to the creation of an entirely new kinetic code called fuse for _ fpion upgrade with two scales of energy_. this code is able to investigate kinetic effects related to fusion reaction products on the ignition of the hot spot and on the subsequent propagation of the thermonuclear burn wave through the dense fuel .",
    "we present here the numerical methods specially designed for the kinetic modeling of @xmath0-particles and their validation in several representative tests .",
    "simulations are preformed for a typical icf dt target , assuming a spherical symmetry in configuration space and axial symmetry in velocity space around the mean velocity .",
    "distribution functions thus depend on one space variable ( radius ) and two velocity components ( radial and azimuthal or perpendicular ) , depending on the chosen parametrization .",

    "once created by fusion reactions , suprathermal @xmath0-particles are transported through an inhomogeneous plasma and slowed down through coulomb collisions with electrons and thermal ions d and t. besides , pressure gradients give rise to an electrostatic field @xmath14 that may accelerate or decelerate @xmath0-particles . to give an accurate description of the particle transport , as well as the non - local energy and momentum exchange that occur between @xmath0-particles and the thermal bulk , a kinetic modeling based on the vlasov - fokker - planck equation is required .      the distribution function @xmath15 of @xmath0-particles characterized by a charge @xmath16 and a mass @xmath17",
    "is governed by the vlasov - fokker - planck equation : @xmath18 the first two terms at the right hand side of this equation describe the collisional relaxation of @xmath0-particles :    * @xmath19 stands for the collisions of @xmath0-particles with electrons , * @xmath20 describes the collisions of @xmath0-particles with thermal ion species . since thermal species densities are significantly higher than the fast @xmath0-particle density ( at least at the beginning of the ignition and burn processes ) , non - linear term corresponding to fast-@xmath0/fast-@xmath0 scattering is neglected .",
    "the coupling between the thermalized @xmath0 particles and the suprathermal ones is naturally included .",
    "we focus now on the collisional part of eq .. the vlasov part of the equation modeling the transport in space and the acceleration due to the electrostatic field is considered separately in sec.[sec4 ] . in a fully ionized plasma such as the one considered here , large angle scattering are much less likely than the net large - angle deflection due to a cumulative effect of many small - angle collisions that the projectile experiences along its path @xcite .",
    "each of the collision terms in right hand side of eq . can then be expressed as a fokker - planck operator in velocity space , which amounts essentially to an advection - diffusion form .",
    "more precisely , the slowing down of @xmath0-particles on a thermal ion species @xmath21 can be written as :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the so - called rosenbluth potentials @xcite associated to the target ions @xmath21 .",
    "they are defined by a set of poisson equations in velocity space : @xmath25 the coefficient @xmath26 is proportional to the coulomb logarithm @xmath27 ( for any species @xmath28 including electrons ) related to the coulomb potential screening and taking quantum effects into account : @xmath29 .",
    "the debye length @xmath30 depends on the temperature @xmath31 , which is expressed in energy units .",
    "@xmath31 is related to the thermal ion distribution function @xmath32 by the relation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the density of ion species @xmath35 and @xmath36 is their mean velocity .",

    "the coulomb logarithm is thus a particular function of hydrodynamic quantities .",
    "it is symmetric with the respect of particle species , @xmath42 , which is related to the energy and momentum conservation during the collision .",
    "the effect of electrons on the slowing down of @xmath0-particles is modeled by another fokker - planck term , in which the electron distribution function is approximated by a maxwellian characterized by a density @xmath43 , a mean velocity @xmath44 and a temperature @xmath45 :    @xmath46,\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is a characteristic @xmath48 collision time defined by : @xmath49 equation is obtained by a truncated expansion of the full ion - electron fokker - planck operator with respect to the small constant @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the last term in stands for the creation of @xmath0-particles by fusion reactions .",
    "the source term is supposed to be isotropic and is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52cm.s@xmath53 is the initial velocity of suprathermal @xmath0-particles whose initial energy is 3.52mev .",
    "@xmath54 is the fusion reaction rate expressed as a function of the distribution functions of d and t , respectively : @xmath55 the distribution functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are solutions of the vlasov - fokker - planck equation written on the deuterium and tritium species , respectively , and they are not necessarily maxwellian functions .",
    "integrals in eq . are taken over the three - dimensional velocity space .",
    "since the characteristic time of the considered problem is close to the ion - ion collision time @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the electron plasma frequency , and the characteristic length is of the order of the ion collisional mean free path @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the electron debye length , the quasi - neutrality assumption is relevant .",
    "we then have :    @xmath62    where the contribution of suprathermal @xmath0-particles is naturally included , @xmath63 being the density and mean velocity of fast @xmath0-particles respectively .",
    "besides , due to a very small ratio of the masses of electrons and ions , the electron equilibration time @xmath64 is significantly smaller than the mean ion - ion collision time @xmath65 . according , for example to @xcite , we have the following ordering of characteristic times : @xmath66 . as a consequence ,",
    "the electron kinetic equation reduces to a fluid equation .",
    "only an equation for the temperature ( or , equivalently , the energy density ) is actually needed since the electron density and velocity are known from the quasi - neutrality conditions ( [ eq : quasineut ] ) .    in the one - dimensional spherical problem considered here ,",
    "the electron energy density @xmath67 is governed by the following conservation equation  : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is spitzer s thermal conductivity @xcite in the presence of several ion species ( see also @xcite and appendix in @xcite ) , the collision time @xmath70 has been defined in eq . where @xmath0 is replaced by the considered ion species @xmath35 . the electron energy density @xmath67 and pressure @xmath71 are given by an equation of state taking into account fermi degeneracy @xcite .    the last term on the right hand side of accounts for the radiation losses of electrons .",
    "3.52 mev @xmath0-particles are created in fusion reactions isotropically , in the system of reference associated with the thermal bulk .",
    "then , they are slowed down through coulomb collisions with electrons , according to eq . , and with thermal ions , according to eq ..",
    "the relative importance of electrons and ions on the slowing down of @xmath0-particles can be estimated by retaining only the dynamical friction terms from the fokker - planck equations and .",
    "the ratio @xmath72 between the ion slowing down and the electron one can thus be approximated by : @xmath73 the ratio @xmath72 is thus defined by a characteristic threshold velocity : @xmath74    so that @xmath75 .",
    "the beginning of the slowing - down of @xmath0 particles is thus governed nearly exclusively by electrons .",
    "then , as @xmath76 , the effect of ions and electrons on the @xmath0 relaxation become comparable .",
    "eventually , the final stage of @xmath0-particle thermalization is essentially influenced by collisions with thermal ions .",
    "supposing @xmath77 , we have the following estimate @xmath78 , @xmath79 being the typical thermal velocity of d and t ions .",
    "the effect of thermal ions on the @xmath0 relaxation dominates when the @xmath0 velocity is below @xmath80 .",
    "we shall refer to such @xmath0-particles as  moderately suprathermal  .",
    "from the previous discussion , we know that 3.52 mev @xmath0-particles are firstly slowed down essentially by electrons .",
    "the first stage of the @xmath0 slowing down is thus described by : @xmath81.\\ ] ] when @xmath82 , the dynamic friction term ( first term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : fsure ] ) ) dominates so that the @xmath0 distribution evolves with respect to : @xmath83.\\ ] ] the stationary solution of ( [ eq : fsurebis ] ) behaves as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is suprathermal @xmath0-particle velocity .",
    "consequently , as long as fast @xmath0-particles remain far from the thermal velocity region , their distribution function varies smoothly over the whole suprathermal velocity region .",
    "the associated velocity scale @xmath86 , defined by : @xmath87 is in particular greater than the target thermal velocity @xmath79 .",
    "then , when slowed down @xmath0-particles get closer to the thermal region but still remain suprathermal , thermal ions tend to dominate the end of the relaxation process , which is then governed by the equation : @xmath88 where only the dynamical friction term is retained for the present discussion",
    ". we shall deal with the diffusion part separately .",
    "qualitatively , one can consider that the distribution function of the thermal target species @xmath21 appears highly localized in velocity space , from the suprathermal @xmath0-particle point of view .",
    "one thus can write : @xmath89 ( assuming that the mean velocity is zero ) .",
    "besides , the divergence with respect to velocity that appears on the right hand side of eq . can be expanded as follows : @xmath90 using the approximation @xmath91 , which is valid from the suprathermal @xmath0-particle point of view , the first rosenbluth potential associated to the target ions @xmath21 can be calculated explicitly : @xmath92 . then , by calculating its derivative , the slowing down of @xmath0 particles can be modeled by : @xmath93 the two terms on the right hand side of eq.([eq : modele_1dbis ] ) have a clear physical sense .",
    "the first term @xmath94 varies slowly and smoothly far from the thermal velocity region .",
    "it can be characterized by a suprathermal velocity scale @xmath95 , which is greater than the typical thermal ion velocity @xmath96 .",
    "actually , the term @xmath97 corresponds to a conservative convection towards @xmath98 .",
    "the associated convective rate @xmath99 increases as @xmath85 tends to @xmath100 so that the solution of : @xmath101\\ ] ] tends to a constant @xmath102 corresponding to the stationary state of ( [ eq : convec_mod ] ) . the part of the @xmath0 distribution driven by ( [ eq : convec_mod ] ) is then stretched and smoothed out as it approaches the thermal velocity region .    the second term @xmath103 appears highly localized in the thermal region of velocity space and behaves qualitatively as a @xmath104-function from the suprathermal @xmath0-particle point of view .",
    "this term actually leads to the formation of a condensate of width @xmath105 .",
    "this qualitative analysis shows intuitively how the _ two - component feature _ of the @xmath0 distribution function builds up .",
    "it is made of a superposition of two components evolving on two different velocity scales , namely :    * a suprathermal component , fed by fusion reactions and evolving on a large velocity scale , greater than the target thermal velocity . * a thermal component , corresponding to the thermalized part of the @xmath0 distribution function , evolving on the same velocity scale as the thermal bulk of the plasma .",
    "note that this component is not fully thermalized since the source term is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "there remains a final stage of collisional relaxation between the thermal components of d , t and @xmath0 ions respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : model1d ] illustrates schematically those processes . from this phenomenological discussion , we can draw a more formal and more rigorous description of the slowing - down which naturally leads to the building of a new multi - scale algorithm solving the initial problem given by eq ..      from the previous analysis , it seems natural to write the @xmath0 distribution function as follows : @xmath107 where : @xmath108 designates the suprathermal component .",
    "it is defined on a large velocity domain , spreading to the mev range .",
    "its typical velocity variation scale @xmath95 is greater than the thermal ion velocity @xmath79 ; @xmath109 is the thermal component .",
    "it is localized in the region of velocity space corresponding to target thermal ion distribution functions and vanishes in the suprathermal velocity domain .",
    "the component @xmath109 is designed to describe accurately the final stage of thermalization of the slowed down @xmath0-particles .",
    "this final relaxation occurrs on a velocity scale @xmath110 .",
    "let us emphasize that two components defined in eq",
    ". do exist in the whole velocity space , the relevant physical quantity being the full @xmath0 distribution function @xmath111 .",
    "the idea is then to deal with each component separately . the original fokker - planck operator given in eq .",
    "is then transformed into a _ system of two coupled equations _ governing the two components @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively : @xmath112    the above equations are written in the system of reference associated with the thermal ions .    system describes the coupling between the suprathermal component and the thermal one , the coupling function being @xmath113 , which is subtracted from the equation on the suprathermal component @xmath108 and appears as a source term in the equation governing the thermal component @xmath114 .",
    "the coupling function can actually be approximated for each of the components of the @xmath0 distribution function in two different ways , depending on the considered velocity scale :    * from the suprathermal component point of view , we have @xmath115 since thermal target ions appear highly localized .",
    "the first rosenbluth potential @xmath23 associated to thermal ions can then be approximated by its temperature - vanishing form .",
    "* from the point of view of the thermal component , we can consider @xmath116 since the suprathermal component is almost constant on the thermal velocity scale @xmath79 .",
    "the term @xmath117 appears as a source term for the thermal component .",
    "it corresponds to a feeding by the suprathermal component .    in eq .",
    ", we have disregarded the process corresponding to a feeding of the suprathermal component by the thermal one , which could be the case if we modeled large angle collisions , such as @xmath118 .",
    "such collisions would build up a suprathermal component for species @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this could be naturally included in the formalism that we describe here , but this is a process of second order since the probability of large angle scattering is @xmath119 times smaller than the pitch - angle collisions modeled by the fokker - planck operator .",
    "we study now the effect of the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "corresponding to a diffusion in velocity : @xmath120 @xmath24 is the second rosenbluth potential associated to the thermal target ions .",
    "the notation @xmath121 stands for the hessian @xmath122 .",
    "let us define the field @xmath123 , representing the slowing - down current of @xmath0-suprathermal particles : @xmath124 using the dirac - function approximation for the thermal target distribution functions , we can approximate @xmath24 by its temperature - vanishing form , @xmath125 . the approximation is relevant from the suprathermal component point of view .",
    "the hessian @xmath126 can then be calculated explicitly : @xmath127 by taking advantage of a polar representation of the velocity @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the polar local basis of velocity space , the hessian simplifies to : @xmath130 the slowing down current defined in eq . expresses the diffusion in velocity associated to the slowing - down process .",
    "it is essentially transverse , that is , perpendicular to the local velocity @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , one can write : @xmath132 the diffusive slowing - down current is thus highly anisotropic in velocity space and it intensifies as @xmath0-particles approaches the thermal bulk region of velocity space .",
    "qualitatively , the collisional relaxation of @xmath0-particles on thermal target ions is thus characterized by :    * a pure advection in velocity space at a constant rate , modeled by eq . , which tends to accumulate @xmath0-particles in the thermal ion velocity region .",
    "* an anisotropic diffusion in velocity space , expressed by eq . , which tends to make the distribution isotropic when slowed - down @xmath0-particles get closer to the final stage of thermalization",

    "firstly , we show how to deal with the two - component nature of the @xmath0 distribution function .",
    "we then develop a finite volume approach to discretize the equation on the @xmath0 suprathermal component .",
    "an efficient explicit algorithm is then applied to model the time evolution of the suprathermal component with relatively low computational time .",
    "we finally present how to simulate accurately the complete thermalization process of @xmath0-particles .",
    "the two - component nature of the @xmath0 distribution function naturally leads to the co - existence of two velocity grids , namely :    * a suprathermal grid , designed to represent the evolution of the suprathermal component of the @xmath0 distribution function @xmath108 .",
    "it covers a large domain in velocity , extending to the range @xmath133 cm / s , which is the velocity corresponding to the @xmath0 particles created by fusion reactions .",

    "this grid is designed to capture the final stage of collisional relaxation of the almost - thermalized component of the @xmath0 distribution on the other thermal ion species d and t. this process entails a velocity resolution much smaller than the local thermal velocity scale @xmath79 .",
