    "the problem of gravitational radiation in particle collisions has a long history and has been studied in a variety of approaches and approximations .",
    "the interested reader may find a long and rather comprehensive list of relevant references in @xcite , where the emitted gravitational energy , as well as its angular and frequency distributions in ultra - relativistic _ massive-_particle collisions were computed . the condition imposed in @xcite that the radiation field should be much smaller than the zeroth order flat metric restricted the region of validity of our approach to impact parameters @xmath3 much greater than the inverse mass of the colliding particles , and made our conclusions not applicable to the massless case .",
    "however , the problem of gravitational radiation in _",
    "massless-_particle collisions is worth studying in its own right and has attracted the interest of many authors in the past as well as very recently .",
    "apart from its obvious relevance in the context of tev - scale gravity models with large extra dimensions @xcite , it is very important in relation to the structure of string theory and the issue of black - hole formation in ultra - planckian collisions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , complete understanding of all facets of the problem is still lacking .",
    "the emission of radiation in the form of _ soft _ gravitons was computed in @xcite in the context of quantum field theory , but in that computation the contribution of the non - linear graviton self - couplings i.e. the stress part of the energy - momentum tensor , was argued to be negligible .",
    "the result of the quantum computation for low - frequency graviton emission was reproduced by a purely classical computation in @xcite , due entirely to the colliding particles and leaving out the contribution of the stress part of the energy - momentum tensor .    in the pioneering work @xcite or its recent generalization to arbitrary dimensions @xcite , the special case of collisions with vanishing impact parameter",
    "was studied , with emphasis on the contribution to the radiation of the stress part of the energy momentum tensor , leaving out the part related to the colliding particles themselves . in a more recent attempt @xcite the metric",
    "was computed to second order , but no computation of the radiation characteristics was presented , apart from an estimate of the emitted energy based essentially on dimensional analysis .",
    "more recently , a new approach was put forward for the computation of the characteristics of the emitted radiation @xcite , based on the fraunhofer approximation of radiation theory . however , this method can not be trusted at very low frequencies @xmath4 and , furthermore , it ignores the non - linear terms of the gravitational action , which are expected to be important in the high frequency regime .",
    "thus , we believe it is fair to conclude , that the issue of the frequency and angular characteristics as well as the efficiency of gravitational radiation in ultra - relativistic particle collisions is not completely settled yet .    the purpose of the present paper is to extend the method used in @xcite to the study of gravitational radiation in collisions of massless particles with center - of - mass energy @xmath5 and impact parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the formal limit @xmath6 ( or equivalently @xmath7 for the lorentz factor ) of the massive case leads to nonsensical answers for the radiation efficiency , i.e. the ratio @xmath8 of the radiated to the available energy , the characteristic radiation frequency @xmath9 , or the characteristic emission angle @xmath10 .",
    "the whole set - up of the computation in the massive case is special to that case and , consequently , does not allow to extract safe conclusions related to massless - particle collisions .",
    "in particular , the massive case computation was performed in the lab frame , the choice of polarization tensors was special to the lab frame , while , being interested in ultra - relativistic collisions , we organized the computation of the energy - momentum source in a power series of the lorentz factor @xmath11 . here",
    ", we shall deal directly with massless collisions in the center - of - mass frame and correct the above inadequacies of our previous results .",
    "we shall study classically the gravitational radiation in the collision of massless particles using the same perturbative approach as in @xcite .",
    "the scattered particles will be described by their classical trajectories , eliminating potential ambiguities in the separation of the radiation field from the field of the colliding particles , inherent in other approaches .",
    "furthermore , at the level of our approximation we shall take into account the contribution of the cubic terms of the gravitational action to the radiation source , which will be shown to be essential for the consistency of our approach .",
    "finally , the efficiency @xmath12 outside a narrow cone in the forward and backward directions will be obtained as a function of the only available dimensionless quantity @xmath13 , formed out of the four parameters @xmath14 , relevant to the problem at hand .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the model , our notation , the equations of motion and the perturbative scheme in our approach .",
    "this is followed by the computation in section 3 of the total radiation amplitude , i.e. the sum of the local and stress part .",
    "section 4 focuses on the study of the angular and frequency characteristics of the emitted radiation in the most important regimes of the emission - angle@xmath15frequency plane . .",
    "furthermore , in a separate subsection we compare the results of this paper to previous work and verify that they are compatible in their common regime of validity .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 , while in three appendices the interested reader may find the details of several steps of the computations and the proofs of basic formulae , used in the main text .",
    "the action describing the two massless particles and their gravitational interaction reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the einbein of the trajectory @xmath18 in terms of the corresponding affine parameter @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the summation is over the two particles .",
    "we will be using unprimed and primed symbols to denote quantities related to the two particles .",
    "variation of the einbeine gives for each particle the constraint @xmath21 using the @xmath22reparametrization invariance @xmath23 we can choose @xmath24 constant .",
    "furthermore , we can use the remaining freedom of @xmath19 rescalings to set @xmath25 on the particle trajectories . finally , we can shift the affine parameters to set @xmath26 at the positions of closest approach of the two particles . before the collision the particle positions are at negative @xmath19 and @xmath27 .",

    "the computation is characterized by , is performed in the center - of - mass frame , used the scattering angle @xmath2 as an angular integration cut - off , and used weinberg s results in regime i. so , before it is appropriate to compare with the massive case , we have to redo the latter following the same methodology and approximations .",

    "thus , the efficiency is finite in the above kinematical regime and agrees with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , to compare with the massless case we have to improve the massive case computation in two ways : ( i ) discard the weak - field condition as it is done here and more generally in the literature , e.g. @xcite , and ( ii ) use the scattering angle @xmath2 as a characteristic angle to cut - off angular integrations . as a consequence of ( i )",

    "* eqn.(2.13 ) ) in the expression for @xmath267 in the zero frequency limit with the corresponding result of weinberg .",
    "specifically , the non - sensical for @xmath7 formula @xmath310 gets modified to @xmath311 given in ( [ demd_ef1 ] ) .    finally , in regime v the direct amplitude and the stress are equally important , both for massive as well as massless colliding particles .",
    "this was important in deriving destructive interference , but on the other hand it does not allow us to replace the source amplitude with weinberg s formula for @xmath301 . to proceed along these lines , one has to  guess \" the correct corresponding modification of @xmath302 , consistent with the conservation requirements for the total energy momentum tensor .",
    "this problem is currently under investigation .",
    "thus , indeed , the results of the present paper can be obtained as the massless limit of the corresponding conclusions of the massive case in their common region of validity .",
    "using the same approach as in @xcite , based on standard gr , with the leading non - linear gravity effects taken into account , we studied collisions of massless particles and computed the gravitational energy of arbitrary frequency , which is emitted outside the cone of angle @xmath312 in the forward and backward directions .",
    "the value @xmath313 was obtained for the radiation efficiency , with characteristic frequency @xmath314 .",

    "is expected , since the _ non - linear _ stress contribution around @xmath317 is comparable to the contribution of the direct linearized emission from the colliding particles . however , as mentioned several times , our approach can not yet deal reliably with regime v , which according to @xcite gives dominant contribution in @xmath12 by an extra factor @xmath318 .",
