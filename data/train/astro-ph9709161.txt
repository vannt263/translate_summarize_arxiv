    "tidal forces are very important in stellar systems . they determine the dynamics of interactions between galaxies in clusters , between a dwarf satellite and a primary galaxy , and between a star cluster and its host galaxy .",
    "the most dramatic tidal perturbations occur in fast and close encounters . when the duration of the encounter is shorter than the characteristic dynamical time of the satellite , such an interaction is referred to as a _ tidal shock _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "many previous semi - analytic and numerical studies of tidal shocks considered the primary galaxy as a point - mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such an approximation is violated when a satellite is well within the limits of the galaxy or a globular cluster passes near the galactic nucleus .",
    "more recent work included the extended structure of the perturber ( king and de vaucouleurs models in @xcite 1985 , 1986 ; isothermal sphere potential in @xcite ; @xcite , 1995 ; and synthetic models in @xcite ; @xcite ) , but most results were obtained through numerical simulations . @xcite and @xcite ( 1997a - c ) used the linear perturbation theory and semi - analytical fokker - planck calculations in their study of globular clusters and elliptical galaxies .",
    "the latter work is complex and can not be easily used for quick estimates . in this paper",
    ", we obtain expressions for the tidal field of an arbitrary spherically - symmetric system and apply them to estimate the amount of heating of the satellite stars produced in the interaction .",
    "the resulting expressions are simple and ready - to - use .",
    "the paper is organized so that we move from the simplest and least accurate treatment to the more complex and more accurate one .",
    "we present analytical calculations of the tidal field and energy changes for straight - path orbits in  [ sec : straight ] and for eccentric orbits in  [ sec : eccentric ] .",
    "first , we use the impulse approximation and then relax it by allowing for the motion of stars during the perturbation .",
    "some tedious integrals are relegated to the appendix .",
    "then , in  [ sec : ngc ] , we apply our theory to calculate the heating of globular cluster ngc  6712  in the galaxy .",
    "we discuss and compare our method with previous work in  [ sec : discussion ] . in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results for semi - analytic studies of tidal interactions .",
    "consider an inertial reference frame with the origin at the galactic center .",
    "let @xmath1 be the trajectory of the center of the satellite , and @xmath2 the distance of a member star from the satellite center .",
    "then the radius - vector of a star is @xmath3 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath4 or @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the potentials of the satellite and the galaxy , respectively .",
    "we will drop the subscripts henceforth .",
    "the trajectory of the center of mass of the satellite is determined by the leading term , @xmath8 , so , in the tidal approximation , we have @xmath9 the potential of a spherically - symmetric system is @xmath10 which produces a tidal force per unit mass @xmath11 , \\label{eq : ftid}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the total mass of the galaxy , and @xmath13 is the normalized mass profile : @xmath14 and @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 the direction to the center of the satellite is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the treatment so far in this section is general .",
    "we will now temporarily restrict ourselves to the impulse approximation and straight line orbits for simplicity in the computation . in the impulse approximation",
    ", we neglect internal motions of the satellite stars during the encounter . the corresponding change in the star s velocity is the integral @xmath18 over the duration of the interaction .",
    "this time - varying perturbation leads to an increase of the random motion ( or heating ) of stars in the satellite . when the phase space is well mixed , the averaged energy change of stars with the initial energy @xmath19 is quadratic in perturbation : @xmath20 we have also neglected the self - consistent reaction of the satellite potential as it settles into a new post - shock equilibrium .",
    "effects of the potential readjustment are studied elsewhere ( @xcite 1998 ) .    to calculate the velocity kick , @xmath21",
    ", we need to specify satellite s orbit . since the tidal force is short - range ,",
    "only the part of the orbit within a few distances of the closest approach ( perigalacticon @xmath22 ) is important .",
    "therefore , the orbit is conventionally assumed to be a straight path , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the orbital velocity at perigalacticon . in  [ sec : eccentric ] , we consider eccentric orbits of the satellite .    integrating equation ( [ eq : dv ] ) from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , we find @xmath27 where    @xmath28    [ eq : int ]    notice also that @xmath29 averaging over an ensemble of stars in a spherically - symmetric satellite , we have @xmath30 .",
    "the heating term per unit mass is therefore @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eq : masscorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these results generalize the usual expressions for a point - mass ( e.g. @xcite 1987 ) to the case of an arbitrary spherical density profile . in particular , the function @xmath32 is the correction due to the extended mass distribution of the primary galaxy . if all galactic mass was concentrated at its center , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 everywhere , and we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the factor @xmath37 becomes unity in this case , as expected .",
    "the subscript `` st '' reminds us that this factor is valid only for the straight path approximation .",
    "the second order energy diffusion term to the lowest order in perturbation is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the position - velocity correlation function , which takes values from -0.25 to -0.57 ( see @xcite 1998 ) .",
    "this can be simply rewritten as @xmath40 higher order terms , @xmath41 , are negligible for tidal shocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , both @xmath42 and @xmath43 terms are quadratic in the perturbation energy , @xmath44",
    ". therefore , only the first two terms are important in the fokker - planck equation ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .      for illustration",
    ", we consider several examples of mass distributions , the hernquist model ( @xcite ) and power - law density profiles .",
    "the hernquist model closely resembles the @xmath45 law for spherical galaxies and gives simple analytical expressions for the potential - density pair : @xmath46 where @xmath12 is the total mass of the galaxy , and @xmath47 is the scale length .",
    "the normalized mass profile is @xmath48 the calculation of the integrals ( [ eq : int ] ) is given in appendix a. the results ( eq . [ [ eq : hint ] ] ) are plotted in figure [ fig : hint ] versus the dimensionless parameter @xmath49 .    for large impact parameters ( @xmath50 ) , both @xmath51 and @xmath52 approach constant values ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 decrease linearly with @xmath57 .",
    "as a result , the satellite is compressed in the vertical direction , stretched in the direction of the perigalacticon by the same amount , and unaffected in the perpendicular direction .",
    "all this is expected in the point - mass approximation . at very small impact parameters ( @xmath58 ) , when the satellite penetrates within a scale length of the center , all correction factors decline approximately as @xmath59 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is due to the mass of the model increasing quadratically with the radius at small @xmath2 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : chivel ] , we plot the absolute value of the components of the velocity change for the hernquist model :    @xmath60    [ eq : chivel ]    note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the velocity changes in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 directions relative to the point - mass approximation .",
    "the velocity change in the @xmath65 direction is negligible for any @xmath57 ; its typical value is @xmath66 . in the point - mass approximation , @xmath67 .",
    "also , we plot for comparison a naive approximation , which assumes the galactic mass inside the perigalacticon @xmath22 to be a point - mass .",
    "the correction factor in this case is @xmath68 .",
    "it underestimates the vertical compression , but overestimates the effect in the radial direction .",
    "next , we consider a general power - law distribution truncated at a limiting radius @xmath69 , @xmath70 here @xmath71 is a constant which determines the total mass of the model , @xmath72 .",
    "we assume that the perturbed satellite is well within the extent of the galaxy , so that truncation of the model does not affect our results .",
    "the normalized mass profile is @xmath73 the evaluation of the tidal integrals ( eqs . [",
    "[ eq : int ] ] ) is straightforward :    @xmath74    @xmath75    note that the integral @xmath51 converges only for @xmath76 . using the identity @xmath77",
    ", we find @xmath78 .",
    "the change of the stellar velocity is @xmath79 where the @xmath65-component vanishes because of the symmetry of the trajectory .",
    "the correction to the energy change is @xmath80 ^ 2 \\ , { \\pi \\ , ( n^2 - 4n+5 ) \\over 8}.\\ ] ] we remind the reader that this result holds for the power - law indices @xmath81 .",
    "notice the change in sign of @xmath82 as the index @xmath83 passes through the value @xmath84 .",
    "for the special case of an isothermal sphere ( @xmath84 ) , the @xmath63-component of the velocity change vanishes identically , and the only resulting change is compression in the vertical direction : @xmath85",
    "the straight - path orbit is a convenient approximation , but in real galaxies , satellites move on eccentric orbits .",
    "effects of tidal shocks are most prominent in the vicinity of the perigalacticon .",
    "the results obtained in the previous section should nevertheless give us insight into the actual heating of satellites on eccentric orbits .",
    "in this section , we determine the true orbits in our examples of galactic models and investigate how tidal heating depends on parameters of the orbit .    in a spherically - symmetric potential ,",
    "the orbit of a satellite is confined to a plane and can be characterized by two independent parameters .",
    "let us choose the perigalactic distance , @xmath22 , and eccentricity , @xmath86 , as such parameters .",
    "they in turn determine the energy and angular momentum of the orbit .",
    "we employ polar coordinates , in which the position angle @xmath87 can be used as a time variable .",
    "this angle is defined such that @xmath88 at @xmath89 . in the coordinate frame where the orbit is in the xy plane ,",
    "the position vector of the satellite is @xmath90 .    using the impulse approximation",
    ", we integrate the tidal force along the orbit to obtain the expected change in the stellar velocity : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the orbital period .    changing the variable of integration from time , @xmath93 , to angle , @xmath94 , using the identity @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the orbital angular momentum , we obtain @xmath97,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the parameter of the galactic model ( @xmath69 in case of the power - law models ) , and @xmath98 is the dimensionless angular momentum , defined by @xmath99 .",
    "the integration over the position angle extends to the maximum angle @xmath100 corresponding to the apogalactic point of the orbit .",
    "thus , the tidal force is integrated starting from the apogalacticon at @xmath101 , approaching the perigalacticon at @xmath88 , and going to the next apogalacticon at @xmath102 .",
    "the maximum value of the position angle ranges from @xmath103 in the keplerian potential to @xmath104 in the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "a very accurate procedure for calculating the orbits is described in appendix b.    rewriting the velocity change into components , we have @xmath105 where    @xmath106",
    "[ eq : b ]    the cross - terms ( @xmath107 ) vanish because of the symmetry of the orbit , @xmath108 .",
    "the energy changes of stars with the initial energy @xmath19 are @xmath109    we have now added adiabatic corrections , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which allow for the motion of stars during the perturbation .",
    "adiabatic corrections reduce the amount of heating as the result of the conservation of stellar adiabatic invariants .",
    "@xcite ( 1998 ) provide a detailed discussion of the adiabatic corrections in the case of disk shocking .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the change of the stellar energy inferred from the n - body modeling of tidal shocks is described to a good accuracy by the product of the impulsive value and the adiabatic correction of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 . here",
    "@xmath114 is the orbital frequency of stars in the satellite , and @xmath115 is the effective duration of the shock .",
    "the exponents @xmath116 depend on the shock duration relative to the half - mass dynamical time of the satellite , @xmath117 , and vary from ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) for @xmath120 to ( @xmath121 ) for @xmath122 .",
    "the adiabatic correction becomes increasingly small in the satellite core , conserving stellar actions and energy .",
    "the simulations were done for the king model of the satellite , with the concentration parameter @xmath123 .",
    "we have checked that expression ( [ eq : adcorr ] ) remains valid for most parts of the more concentrated model with @xmath124 . however , our adiabatic corrections slightly underestimate the energy change in the core .",
    "it is possible that equation ( [ eq : adcorr ] ) breaks for very concentrated satellites and thus should be applied with caution .",
    "see also @xcite ( 1994a - c ) for the direct application of the perturbation theory formalism .",
    "the adiabatic correction was calculated under the assumption that the perturbing force varies with time as a gaussian function , @xmath125 .",
    "this assumption does not strongly limit the applicability of the results since numerical simulations show that significant energy changes occur only close to the perigalacticon , where almost any tidal force has similar behavior . as an example , consider a keplerian orbit of eccentricity @xmath86 . near the perigalacticon , the angle @xmath126 and the vertical component of the tidal force varies in agreement with the gaussian : @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are some constants . see ",
    "[ sec : ngcorbit ] for more discussion of the temporal structure of the tidal force .",
    "the adiabatic correction depends not only on the stellar frequency , @xmath130 , but also on the orbital eccentricity of the satellite , through the parameter @xmath115 . on low eccentricity orbits ,",
    "the effective duration of the `` shock '' becomes so long that adiabatic corrections prohibit the changes of the stellar energy . on circular orbits ,",
    "the effects of tidal shocks are greatly reduced .",
    "we will return to adiabatic corrections in  [ sec : ngc ] , when we consider the evolution of globular cluster ngc  6712 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results for the satellites on eccentric orbits with those on the straight path . for the hernquist model ,",
    "we perform the integration of equations ( [ eq : b ] ) numerically for a grid of perigalactica and eccentricities .",
    "we now rewrite equation ( [ eq : deecc ] ) for @xmath131 similarly to equation ( [ eq : de ] ) , extracting the factor @xmath132 which is now a function of the two parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath86 . for clarity ,",
    "the factor @xmath133 does not include the adiabatic correction @xmath110 .",
    "figure [ fig : corr_h ] shows the ratio @xmath134 for the orbits with various eccentricities . for highly eccentric orbits , @xmath135 , the ratio varies slightly with @xmath57 , from @xmath136 for @xmath50 to @xmath137 for @xmath58 .",
    "the latter limit corresponds to the most eccentric keplerian orbit where both approaches must agree .",
    "however , as the eccentricity decreases , the ratio @xmath134 varies with @xmath57 much more strongly . while at @xmath50 , the ratio is highest for @xmath138 , the opposite is true for @xmath58 .",
    "the power - law models are scale - free and allow further simplification of equations ( [ eq : b ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and therefore @xmath141 the remaining integrals depend only on the eccentricity @xmath86 .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain    @xmath142    [ eq : c ]    note that in the harmonic oscillator potential ( @xmath143 ) , the first two integrals are identically zero : @xmath144 .",
    "the third one can be done using simple analytic orbits allowed in this potential ( eq . [ [ eq : a.oscorb ] ] ) : @xmath145 surprisingly enough , the change of the stellar energy depends neither on the location in the galaxy , @xmath57 , nor on the orbital eccentricity , @xmath86 .",
    "the satellite is equally compressed in all directions : @xmath146    in the isothermal sphere potential ( @xmath84 ) , the integrals are also done straightforwardly :    @xmath147    for the @xmath148 model , the integrals @xmath149 are done numerically . figure [ fig : power ] shows the factors @xmath132 for all three models . for comparison",
    ", we also plot @xmath37 for the isothermal sphere model . heating on eccentric orbits is larger than that on the straight path , except for @xmath150 , where the two are equal",
    ". however , the plot does not include adiabatic corrections , which would have effectively reduced heating on low - eccentricity orbits .",
