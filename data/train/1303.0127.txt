    "in quantum optics , the concept of phase for a single mode electromagnetic field has remained a somewhat controversial topic .",
    "alternative descriptions for phase observables have been developed , and hundreds of articles ( see , e.g. , the reference lists of @xcite ) and several monographs ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been written on the subject since dirac s famous paper @xcite published in 1927 .",
    "a major reason for this variety of phase theories is that in trying to define the phase of a quantum oscillator , one can clearly see the restrictions of the conventional approach which identifies observables with selfadjoint operators , or equivalently , their spectral measures .",
    "in fact , it is well known that no spectral measure satisfies all physically relevant conditions posed on phase observables ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and this problem has been overcome with the introduction of the more general concept of observables as ( normalized ) positive operator valued measures ( povms ) .",
    "a natural requirement for the description of a phase measurement is _ covariance _ with respect to phase shifts . in other words ,",
    "the application of a phase shifter on the field prior to the measurement should only shift the phase distribution without changing its shape .",
    "although there exist an infinite number of phase shift covariant povms , it is generally accepted that the canonical phase measurement for the single - mode radiation field is represented by the london phase distribution @xcite .",
    "hence , the canonical phase measurement is described by the canonical phase observable @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the number basis , and @xmath4 is the ( formal ) susskind - glogower phase state @xcite .",
    "we also recall that the canonical phase measurement arises as the limiting distribution of the pegg - barnett formalism @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 has been independently derived by helstrom @xcite and holevo @xcite in the more general context of quantum estimation theory .",
    "the canonical phase has a number of properties which makes it an optimal choice among other phase observables : for instance , @xmath0 is pure , i.e.  an extreme point of the convex set of all povms @xcite .",
    "any other covariant phase observable @xmath5 is connected to the canonical phase via a quantum channel @xmath6 as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the canonical phase is also ( essentially ) the only covariant phase observable which generates number shifts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 and the photon number @xmath8 are noncoexistent , probabilistically and value complementary observables @xcite .",
    "finally , the canonical phase distribution of coherent states @xmath9 , @xmath10 , tends to a dirac delta distribution in the classical limit @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a list of further properties of @xmath0 can be found , e.g. , in p.  51 of @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding a suitable realistic measurement model for the canonical phase observable is the last big open problem concerning the quantum description of the phase of an electromagnetic field . of course",
    ", @xmath0 ( or any observable of the field ) can be ` measured ' indirectly or ` sampled ' by first measuring some informationally complete observable ( e.g.  the  @xmath12-function or the collection of rotated quadratures ) and then constructing the canonical phase distribution .",
    "however , these approaches may hardly be regarded as direct measurements in the spirit of the quantum theory of measurement @xcite .",
    "some suggestions for direct measurements of @xmath0 can be found from literature , see e.g.  @xcite , but they have not led to experiments .",
    "it seems that from the experimental point of view , the most easily accessible phase observables are those arising as the angle margins of certain ( translation covariant ) phase space observables",
    ". such observables are often referred to as ( covariant ) phase space phase observables , the most familiar example being the angle margin of the husimi @xmath12-function of the field @xcite .",
    "a natural measurement setup for these phase space measurements is then the double homodyne detection scheme ( also known as eight - port homodyne detection ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which has also been demonstrated experimentally @xcite . even though the phase space phase observables seem like a natural choice for measuring the phase of the electromagnetic field , they suffer from certain drawbacks when compared with the canonical phase .",
    "for instance , the phase space phase observables are not pure @xcite , and the canonical phase @xmath0 gives smaller ( minimum ) variance in large amplitude coherent states than phase space phase observables @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take a step in the direction of obtaining a realistic measurement scheme for the canonical phase .",
    "first , we determine those measurement models of covariant phase observables which are minimal ( in a sense to be defined ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain as a special case the minimal measurement models of the canonical phase @xmath0 .",
    "since previous works indicate that the natural candidates for phase measurements are actually measurements of some phase space observables , which would then give the phase distribution after integration over the radial part , we then study joint measurements of arbitrary povms and the canonical phase .",
    "after that we focus on the so - called phase shift covariant phase space observables , where we also present some physically relevant examples .",
    "finally , we turn to the double homodyne detection scheme and show that , in principle , the canonical phase distribution of the signal state can be measured with the setup by adding an extra two - mode unitary coupling in front of the apparatus .",
    "throughout this paper we consider a single mode electromagnetic field as our physical system .",
    "the hilbert space of the system is therefore @xmath13 , and it is spanned by the orthonormal basis consisting of the number states @xmath14 , @xmath15 , which in the coordinate representation are identified with the hermite functions .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the creation , annihilation and number operators related to this basis .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 or briefly @xmath20 is the identity operator of @xmath21 .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the sets of bounded and trace class operators on @xmath21 .",
    "the states of the field are represented by positive trace class operators @xmath24 with unit trace ( i.e. ,  density operators ) , and the observables are represented by normalized positive operator valued measures ( povms ) @xmath25 on the borel @xmath26-algebra of the topological space @xmath27 of possible measurement outcomes .- algebra @xmath28 consisting of subsets of the measurement outcome set @xmath27 .",
    "] we say that an observable is sharp if it is projection valued , that is , a spectral measure .",
    "the measurement outcome probabilities are given by the probability measures @xmath29}$ ] .",
    "for our purposes , the relevant measurement outcome spaces are the torus @xmath30 , which is identified with @xmath31 with addition modulo @xmath32 , the space of nonnegative real numbers @xmath33 , and the phase space @xmath34 .",
    "while observables represent the statistical description of a measurement , they say nothing about the change in the system s state caused by the measurement .",
    "the effect of the measurement on the system is captured in the concept of an instrument @xcite .",
    "recall that a completely positive instrument is a map @xmath35 , @xmath36 such that each @xmath37 is completely positive , @xmath38 } = 1 $ ] for all states @xmath39 , and the map @xmath40 is @xmath26-additive for all states @xmath39 .",
    "each instrument determines the dual instrument @xmath41 by @xmath42}={\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { { { \\mathcal i}}_x(\\rho)b } \\right]}$ ] for @xmath43 , @xmath24 and @xmath44 , and the associated observable @xmath45 via @xmath46 } = { \\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { { \\mathcal{i}}_x(\\rho ) } \\right]}$ ] , or equivalently , as @xmath47 . in this case",
    "we say that the instrument ( or its dual ) is _ @xmath45-compatible_. it is well known that , for a given povm @xmath48 , there are infinitely many @xmath45-compatible instruments , that is , an observable can be measured in many ways .",
    "any completely positive instrument can also be dilated to a quantum measuring process @xcite , that is , any instrument can be realized as a unitary measurement model of the corresponding povm : for any instrument @xmath49 there exist a hilbert space @xmath50 associated with the probe system , an initial pure state @xmath51 of the probe , a unitary measurement interaction @xmath52 between the system and the probe , and a spectral measure @xmath53 of the probe , the pointer observable , which define the instrument @xmath49 uniquely via @xmath54\\ ] ] where @xmath55 $ ] denotes partial trace over the hilbert space of the probe . since for each povm @xmath48 , there exists an infinite number of instruments which are compatible with @xmath48 , and any instrument has infinitely many realizations , it is natural to ask which are the minimal measurement models of @xmath48 .",
    "in such a measurement model there would be no unnecessary degrees of freedom in the measuring process .",
    "this question was solved in @xcite .",
    "we may now turn our attention to the problem of covariant phase observables .",
    "as already mentioned before , covariance here is with respect to phase shifts which then reflects the requirement that any phase shift performed on the field prior to the measurement should cause a corresponding shift in the distribution of the measurement outcomes .",

    "we will now turn our attention to the double homodyne detector ( also called the eight - port homodyne detector ) , a well established method for measuring translation covariant phase space observables related to a single mode electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this scheme makes use of the fact that the usual single homodyne detector provides a measurement of an arbitrary field quadrature . indeed ,",
    "when the signal field under investigation is coupled to a strong auxiliary field in a coherent state @xmath399 using a @xmath400 beam splitter , and the scaled photon number difference @xmath401 of the two output modes is measured , then for a sufficiently large @xmath402 the measured observable is approximately the quadrature observable @xmath403 , where @xmath404 and @xmath405 , @xmath53 being the canonical spectral measure on the real line ( i.e. , the position observable ) ( for more details , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in double homodyne detection , the signal field is first coupled to a parameter field in some state @xmath26 via a @xmath400 beam splitter , after which a phase shift of @xmath406 is performed on one of the output modes ( see fig .  [ eightport ] ) .",

    "the measured observable is the phase space observable @xmath408 where the generating operator is connected to the state of the parameter field via the conjugation map @xmath409 as @xmath410 @xcite .",
    "in particular , if we want the observable to be phase shift covariant and thus give rise to a phase observable as the angle margin , we must use a parameter field which is diagonal in the number state representation , @xmath411 .",

    "beam splitter , after which a phase shift of @xmath413 is performed on one of the modes .",

    "the problem with using this measurement setup is of course caused by the fact that the canonical phase can not be obtained as the margin of any translation covariant phase space observable @xcite .",
    "thus , a modification of the setup is needed .",
    "we will next show that a suitable modification is obtained by adding a unitary coupling between the signal and parameter fields prior to the beam splitter .",
    "in other words , while in the usual double homodyne detection the signal and parameter fields are uncorrelated before entering the beam splitter , with this modification they will enter the beam splitter in an entangled state . with this method",
    ", it is in principle possible to measure also the observables @xmath414 encountered in example [ ex2 ] .    to this end",
    ", first notice that in the usual double homodyne detector , the overall unitary coupling consisting of the beam splitter and the phase shifter is given by @xmath415 , @xmath416 where @xmath417 consists of the input signal and parametric field modes and @xmath418 is the output space .",
    "the observable measured with the two homodyne detectors is then ( or rather may be chosen to be ) the canonical spectral measure @xmath419 . if @xmath39 and @xmath26 are the states of the signal and parameter fields , respectively , then a direct computation shows that @xmath420 } = { \\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { \\rho { \\mathsf{g}}^{\\sigma ' } ( z ) } \\right]}\\ ] ] for all @xmath421 .",
    "hence , by considering only the angle margin @xmath422 as the pointer observable , one can measure the angle margin @xmath423 .",
    "in particular , by preparing the parameter field in a state which is diagonal in the number basis , one can measure any phase space phase observable .",
    "now it is easily seen from the discussion in example [ ex2 ] that the total coupling needed for the measurement of @xmath414 is @xmath424 we want to exploit the fact that we already have at our disposal the unitary coupling of the usual double homodyne detector .",
    "therefore , we will look for a unitary operator @xmath425 such that @xmath426 , which would then amount to adding an extra component to the measurement setup prior to the beam splitter , see fig .",

    "such that @xmath427 , but this leads to a similar treatment . ]     is performed prior to the beam splitter . by choosing the parameter field to be in the vacuum state , on can obtain the canonical phase observable as the angle margin of the measured phase space observable . ]",
    "the action of the operator @xmath428 is now given by @xmath429 let us denote @xmath430 so that @xmath431 the above integral can be further calculated , but it seems that a simple closed expression does not exist .",
