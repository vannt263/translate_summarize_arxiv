    "simplest inflationary scenarios predict almost scale invariant , almost gaussian and almost adiabatic perturbations and the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies are in very good agreements with these predictions  @xcite .",

    "in particular a detection of non - gaussianity would exclude a large class of inflationary scenarios .",
    "there have been many attempts in the literature to generalize local features during inflation which may have non - trivial predictions on the power spectrum and bispectrum  @xcite .",

    "we provide a dynamical mechanism to generate local features in the power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "the model consists of a simple chaotic inflation potential , @xmath1 , coupled to a heavy field @xmath2 .",
    "after @xmath3 reaches a critical value @xmath4 , @xmath2 becomes tachyonic and a rapid waterfall phase transition takes place . in this sense",
    "the model is similar to hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "however , the key difference is that the potential is not vacuum dominated but the chaotic type inflaton potential is the main driving source of inflation .",

    "inflation may be divided into three stages . at the first stage @xmath5 ,",
    "inflation proceeds as in chaotic inflation .",
    "the second stage at which @xmath6 is fairly short , of the order of the hubble time , and @xmath2 becomes tachyonic and a waterfall phase transition takes place where @xmath2 settles to its global minimum .",
    "this causes a small change in the inflaton effective mass , @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "then the third stage proceeds as in chaotic inflation again . in order to bring the local feature into the observable windon of cmb",

    "see @xcite .",
    "due to the sharpness of the waterfall phase transition , the waterfall contribution in @xmath11 is narrowly localized around the modes which leave the horizon at the time of waterfall transition .",
    "furthermore , due to the intrinsically non - gaussian nature of the waterfall contribution , which is in the form of @xmath12 , a large spiky bispectrum is generated .",
    "we emphasize that this is a local dynamical effect intrinsic to the waterfall quantum fluctuations which are absent in other models , hence is an observationally testable feature genuinely specific to our model .",

    "we present our model and basic setup . in section [ sec : deltan ] we calculate @xmath13 using the @xmath14 formalism . in section [ sec : bispectrum ] we calculate the dynamical and intrinsic non - gaussianities in our scenario followed by conclusion and discussions in section [ sec : conclusion ] . technical details about the power spectrum of the waterfall quantum fluctuations and higher order @xmath14 perturbations are deferred to appendices .",
    "in this section we present our setup in modeling local features during inflation . in our picture , we consider the simplest inflationary model , the chaotic potential @xmath1 , where we assume the mass of inflaton undergoes a sudden dynamical change at @xmath15 .",
    "we would like to see how a sudden small change in the inflaton mass can be modeled in a consistent dynamical way and then look for its observational consequences in cmb .",
    "one of the best known dynamical mechanism for inducing local feature during inflation is the idea of waterfall phase transition . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the following setup : [ potential ] v= ^2 + ( ^2 - ) ^2 + ^2 ^2 , where @xmath3 is the inflaton field and @xmath2 is the waterfall field . formally potential ( [ potential ] ) is identical to hybrid inflation @xcite . however , as we mentioned above , in our picture inflation is mainly driven by the field @xmath3 so in our picture effectively inflation proceeds as in chaotic model with potential @xmath16 with some effective mass @xmath17 which undergoes a small but abrupt change at @xmath15 .",
    "the waterfall field @xmath2 is employed to induce this change in mass .    in this model , like in chaotic inflation , inflation starts at @xmath18 , with @xmath19 for @xmath20 being the newton constant , so one can obtain 60 @xmath10-folds or more to solve the horizon and flatness problems . the waterfall field is very heavy during the first stage of inflation so it remains at its instantaneous minimum @xmath21 .",
    "once the inflaton field reaches the critical value @xmath22 , the waterfall field @xmath2 becomes tachyonic and quickly rolls down to its global minimum @xmath23 .",
    "the final stage of inflation after @xmath24 proceeds as in chaotic inflation again but with the effective mass of the inflaton , @xmath25 , given by m_+^2 = m^2 + g^2 ^2 = m^2 ( 1 + c ) where c . in our model",
    ", we assume the change in inflaton mass is small , @xmath26 . in order to bring this local feature into the observable scale , we assume that the short waterfall stage which lasts for about an @xmath10-fold or so begins at around 55 @xmath10-folds before the end of inflation .",
    "it is instructive to look into different contributions to the potential before the phase transition where @xmath27 .",
    "we have @xmath28 .",
    "having @xmath26 in our model corresponds to the assumption that the inflationary potential is dominated by the @xmath1 term .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard hybrid inflation where the potential is vacuum dominated corresponding to @xmath29 .",
    "before we proceed further we pause to compare our scenario to the one studied in @xcite where the potential is still given by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "however , in @xcite they are interested in the limit where @xmath30 so inflation is mildly vacuum dominated .",
    "hence their model is effectively a single field model where the waterfall quantum fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper we pay careful attention to the dynamics of the waterfall phase transition and calculate rigorously the curvature perturbations induced from the waterfall quantum fluctuations .",
    "for this to happen , we require @xmath31 .    as usual the cosmological background is given by ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 d^2 , where @xmath32 is the scale factor .",
    "it is more convenient to change the clock from the cosmic time @xmath33 to the number of @xmath10-folds @xmath34 via @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hubble expansion rate . denoting the time when the waterfall phase transition takes place by @xmath37 , we further define @xmath38 .",
    "hence @xmath39 for the period before the phase transition and @xmath40 after the transition .",
    "we denote the end of the waterfall transition when @xmath2 has settled down to its global minimum by @xmath41 . with this notation , inflation in our model",

    "we set @xmath46 so that the waterfall transition falls into the observable range .",
    "we are interested in the limit where the waterfall phase transition is fairly sharp , corresponding to @xmath47 so the waterfall transition and symmetry breaking completion takes place in an @xmath10-fold or so .",
    "the key ingredient in our analysis is the dynamics of the waterfall quantum fluctuations during this short period and the curvature perturbations induced from them . to investigate this",
    "we will use the @xmath14 formalism  @xcite .    as mentioned before , we assume that the waterfall field is very heavy so it stays at @xmath21 and @xmath48 during the first and third stages .",
    "it is useful to introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 by [ alpha - beta ] , , where in the last approximate equalities in both expressions it is assumed that @xmath51 .",
    "the assumption that the slow - roll conditions hold during the first and third inflationary stages requires @xmath52 . demanding that @xmath53 for the waterfall field to be heavy , we require @xmath54 .",
    "on the other hand , from the cobe normalization we have @xmath55 so @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we assume the onset of the phase transition and the time of sudden change in the inflaton mass to occur about 55 @xmath10-folds before the end of inflation so that it falls within the cmb observational window . in order for inflation to proceed long enough after the phase transition as in the standard chaotic inflation we require",
