    "until now any precision test of bound state qed @xcite was always realized in the way that only a final theoretical figure could be compared with some experimental result and no term of any theoretical expression could be tested separately .",
    "any theoretical expression is a function of few parameters and one of them is the nuclear charge @xmath1 .",
    "however , there was no way to measure any function of @xmath1 .",
    "only very few particular values of @xmath1 were available for precision experiments of the lamb shift , fine and hyperfine structure .",
    "now this has been changed dramatically .",
    "recently a bound electron @xmath0 factor in the hydrogen - like carbon ion was measured very accurately by the mainz - gsi collaboration @xcite .",
    "we consider here this new opportunity to test bound state qed and to determine precisely some fundamental constants from the study of the bound electron @xmath0 factor .",
    "in contrast to the study of the lamb shift and hyperfine structure , it is possible to perform experiments on the @xmath0 factor of the bound electron in different hydrogen - like ions with about the same accuracy .",
    "the experiment [ 1 ] is now in progress and some other hydrogen - like ions can be measured soon .",
    "this provides a possibility to learn about the bound @xmath0 factor as a function of the nuclear charge @xmath1 and the nuclear mass number @xmath2 .",
    "the ions under study @xcite must have spinless nuclei and so they have the most simple level scheme .    the measured value is equal to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron mass , and @xmath5 is the nuclear mass .",
    "the latter is usually known accurately in atomic mass units .",
    "if we determine the bound electron @xmath0 factor from the theory , then the experiment leads to a new precision value of the electron mass in atomic units .",
    "the accuracy of the electron mass value is compatible with the one from a direct measurement @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the theory of the @xmath0 factor in the carbon ion is on about the same level as the experimental one .",
    "the theoretical precision can be improved if the berillium ion , where the only unknown correction @xmath6 is small and negligible , is studied .    another way to manage experimentally",
    "the problem of the unknown term is to use another kind of theory .",
    "the usual theory in the case of simple atoms ( we call it _ strong theory _ ) give us some values , while in case of the @xmath0 factor it must be useful even to fix a form of the theoretical expression ( we call this option _ weak theory _ ) .",
    "when one knows part of the theoretical terms and a form of other terms , it is possible try to measure the unknown coefficients .",
    "the only unknown term which is important for carbon and ions with @xmath1 around 6 is of order @xmath6 .",
    "one can take an advantage of the _ weak theory _ approach and measure the coefficient of this term by studying with the oxygen ion .",
    "an important feature of the study of the @xmath0 factor of a bound electron at @xmath7 is also the possibility to learn about higher - order two - loop corrections , which are one of the crucial problems of bound state qed theory .",
    "below we discuss in detail the present status of theory and experiment .",
    "we consider a new opportunity to precisely test bound state qed and to accurately determine two fundamental constants : the electron - to - proton mass ratio and the fine structure constant .    below",
    "we discuss in detail a number of problems arising due to the precision study of the bound electron @xmath0 factor .",
    "we follow the notation of our paper @xcite and present the @xmath0 factor of a bound electron in a hydrogen - like ion in the form @xmath8 where the bound electron anomalous magnetic moment at low @xmath1 is @xmath9 , while the free part of the anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath10 .",
    "it is useful to split the bound - state electron anomaly into three terms @xcite : @xmath11 where two first terms @xcite @xmath12 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & ( z\\alpha)^2\\left[-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m}{m}- \\frac{1+z}{2}\\left(\\frac{m}{m}\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{12}(z\\alpha)^2\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xcite @xmath13\\ ] ] are due to kinematic effects , while the last term is due to some non - trivial bound - states effects .",
    "the @xmath14 term starts from the order of @xmath15 and contains qed ( @xmath16 and higher ) @xcite , nuclear size ( @xmath17 and higher ) @xcite and recoil ( @xmath6 and higher ) corrections . in table 1",
    "we present the most accurate published values @xcite of different contributions to @xmath14 .",
    "the uncertainty was not specified there and we estimate it as half the value of the last digit .",
    "more precise calculations are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".some contributions to @xmath14 in units of @xmath18 due to vacuum polarization ( @xmath19 ) , self - energy ( @xmath20 ) and finite nuclear size ( @xmath21 ) .",
