    "however , the amplitude involves three powers of @xmath55 , so that @xmath58 this leads to an enhancement over the sm value by up to three orders of magnitude .",
    "this holds even in the flavour - universal mssm , where flavour changes occur in weak vertices only and come with the usual ckm elements @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the limit of infinite susy mass parameters the mssm contribution does not vanish , because the mssm approaches a general 2hdm with flavour - changing neutral higgs couplings in this limit .",
    "this feature and the resulting importance of @xmath27 physics to probe the large @xmath4 regime of the mssm was first emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric contributions enhancing @xmath54 will also affect the branching ratio and forward - backward asymmetry in the decay @xmath59 but these effects are small and strongly correlated with @xmath54 and will only be measurable , if @xmath54 is close to its experimental upper bound @xcite .    the first analysis of in the minimal supergravity scenario ( msugra ) revealed an interesting correlation of @xmath54 with the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath25 and the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xcite : if @xmath25 exceeds the sm prediction by @xmath60 ( which is the maximum allowed from bnl @xcite ) , @xmath61 is larger by a factor of 10100 than in the sm and within reach of run ii of the tevatron .",

    "a substantial enhancement of @xmath54 in anomaly - mediated susy breaking scenarios is impossible and also hard to accommodate with gauge - mediated susy - breaking .",

    "@xcite the authors used isajet 7.42 @xcite for the simulation of the signal . for the background they used pythia 6.115 @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "they used a combination of pythia and comhep @xcite for the wz background .",
    "instead , we use herwig6.4 @xcite to simulate the signal and a combination of herwig and comphep to simulate the background .",
    "this has a number of advantages due to recent improvements in herwig . while isajet7.42 uses matrix elements for the three body decays of the gauginos it performs the production and decay of the susy particles independently .",
    "herwig6.4 makes use of the method described in @xcite to perform the susy decays including all the momentum and spin correlations .",
    "one of the major advantages of our studies is that the spin correlation algorithm used in herwig can use the tauola decay package @xcite to give the correct helicity of the tau on an event - by - event basis , rather than averaging as was done in @xcite .",
    "isajet7.58 is used to calculate the susy spectrum and decay rates .    in our simulation",
    "we make use of the pgs @xcite detector simulation .",
    "this is a more recent version of the shw package .",
    "the default pgs parameters are used together with the following additions .    1 .   a requirement that the total transverse energy in a cone of size @xmath66 about the direction of a muon is less than 2  gev .",

    "the transverse energy @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the energy of a particle .",
    "3 .   a cut on the ratio of the electromagnetic , @xmath72 , to hadronic energy , @xmath73 , in a jet @xmath74 to avoid electrons being considered as jets .",

    "the shw simulation , which was the    predecessor to pgs , gives a reasonable simulation of fake tau    production @xcite , and we therefore rely on the monte carlo    simulation for fake tau production .",

    "@xcite to normalize the results .",
    "there is also a potential background from the production of @xmath76 followed by the semi - leptonic decay of the produced b - flavoured hadrons .",
    "however , this should be negligible after the isolation and cuts on the transverse momentum , @xmath77 , of the leptons .    in all cases we use herwig6.4 to simulate the signal .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which give the dominant contribution to the susy production , are normalized to the next - to - leading order cross section using the results of @xcite .",
    "the leading - order cross section from herwig is used for the remaining processes .",
    "the basic idea of the analysis is to take several different cuts , which should differentiate between the signal and the background , consider all possible combinations of the cuts at each point in parameter space and optimize the choice of cuts in order to maximize @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath27 are the number of signal and background events respectively .",
    "in addition to the requirement of @xmath82 all the contours shown also require that there at least five signal events .",
    "the cuts can be split into two types : channel - independent cuts and those which are specific to a given channel .",
    "the channel independent cuts we use are :    1 .   five possible cuts on the missing transverse energy , @xmath83  gev or no cut ; 2 .   an optional veto on the presence of qcd jets with @xmath84  gev in the event .",
    "3 .   a cut on the minimum invariant mass of any opposite sign same flavour electron or muon ( ossf ) pairs in the event @xmath85  gev , or no cut .",
    "4 .   a cut on the maximum invariant mass of any ossf pairs in the event , or a cut on the minimum difference between the mass of any ossf pair and the z mass @xmath86  gev , or no cut . 5 .   a cut removing any events which have an electron or muon with transverse mass @xmath87 .",
    "the transverse mass is given by , where @xmath88 is the transverse momentum of the lepton , @xmath89 is the missing transverse momentum and @xmath90 is the azimuthal angle between the lepton and the missing transverse momentum .",
    "the channel dependent cuts are :    1 .   for the trilepton and like - sign lepton signature we require a central electron or muon with @xmath91 and @xmath92  gev , or no requirement for a central lepton .",
    "2 .   for the lepton+ tau jet channel",
    "we require that the tau decay only has one prong and that the fraction of the tau jet s momentum carried by the charged track is greater than 80% , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "a cut on the transverse momenta of the leptons is also applied depending on the channel , the cuts for the various different channels are given in table  [ tab : ptcut ] .",

    "overall , we thus obtain a more promising trilepton search reach at run  ii of the tevatron than in previous studies .",
    "this is one of the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "although we present our analysis in terms of the fundamental parameters of msugra @xmath103 , there exist mass sum rules  @xcite relating these parameters to the physical masses .",

    "the 3l events dissappear for the reason we have already explained when discussing fig.1 . however , a large portion of the parameter space with @xmath142 is still accessible to   searches .",
    "the parameter space with @xmath4 values below 30 has to be covered by other searches , most probably higgs searches ( squarks and gluinos are too heavy to be directly discovered at tevatron in the msugra scenario  @xcite . ) the two cases @xmath143gev and @xmath144gev have to be considered respectively as the most `` promising '' and the `` nightmare '' benchmark scenarios for the tevatron run ii . in order to complete the discussion on @xmath135 plane we show in fig .",

    "apart from the trilepton ( 3l ) analysis , we also study the modes with like sign dileptons ( 2l ) , dilepton plus tau - jet ( 2l1 t ) , lepton plus two tau - jets ( 1l2 t ) , three tau - jets ( 3 t ) , like sign lepton plus tau - jet ( 1l1 t ) , and two like sign tau - jets ( 2 t ) in the final state .",
    "the idea is to identify alternative signatures in regions of the parameter space where the 3l signal is suppressed .",

    "2l events are only observable with @xmath150 for @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "the search reach we obtain for signatures involving more than one hadronic tau are worse than those obtained previously @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is that we started from the leading - order drell - yan production processes with additional jets generated by the parton - shower algorithm for w and z production , whereas @xcite started from the w / z+jets process .",
    "the study in @xcite was also at the parton - level rather than using fast detector simulation .",
    "this means we have a much larger background from w / z with fake taus .",
    "this agrees with the results of @xcite where the signals with at least two electrons / muons gave the largest reach .",
    "it should also be noted the we took no account of the problems of triggering on the multi - hadronic tau final states which will make the situation even worse .",
    "we have presented two complementary observables to study the parameter space of minimal supergravity at run - ii of the fermilab tevatron : the production of charginos or neutralinos decaying into trilepton ( or other than trilepton ) final states and the branching ratio of the rare decay .",
    "the simulation of the trilepton events has been improved over previous results in various respects . in particular",
    "next - to - leading qcd corrections have been incorporated where available and the full momentum and spin correlations between production and decay of the supersymmetric particles have been taken into account .",
    "we have also presented modified cuts . with these enhancements",
    "we find the tevatron reach for trilepton events increased .",
    "the two studied observables reveal very useful complementary information on the msugra parameter space , covering the regions of small and large @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "our results can be read directly from the figs.1,2 .",
    "for example , for @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 we find that a run - iib with 30 @xmath156 will probe values of @xmath0 in the range @xmath157 which decreases with @xmath55 . on the contrary , if the tevatron can measure @xmath54 down to @xmath158 ( which requires less than 30 @xmath156 of integrated luminosity ) , this will probe the region with @xmath159 and the range @xmath160 for the chosen values of @xmath1 , @xmath161 and @xmath15 .",
    "similar results can be drawn for other choices of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this work should be considered as a first attempt of relating `` direct '' susy searches such as the 3l events with an `` indirect '' rare b - decay , such as at the tevatron .",
