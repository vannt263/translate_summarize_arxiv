    "the renowned uncertainty principle is one of the distinctive features of quantum mechanics , which was introduced by heisenberg in the description of microscopic quantum behavior @xcite , somewhat similar to the concept of complementary raised by bohr @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty relation(ur ) is a mathematical expression for uncertainty principle , referring to the repulsive nature of incompatible operators and hence imposing a strong restriction on the outcomes of any joint measurement on those operators . since the ur has profound influence on various aspects of quantum information , e.g. quantum nonlocality @xcite , entanglement @xcite , and quantum cryptography @xcite , the study on it",
    "has never stopped .",
    "it is well - known that the most famous uncertainty relation , the heisenberg - robertson uncertainty relation @xcite , bounds the product of the variances of observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 through the expectation value of their commutator , i.e. , @xmath2 here , the state @xmath3 is arbitrary , @xmath4 is the square root of the variance of a given operator @xmath5 , and @xmath6 = 2ic$ ] is the commutator of operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note , the relation ( [ robertson - u ] ) is applicable to any pairs of operators , rather than only to conjugate observables .",
    "thought later improvement @xcite strengthened the uncertainty relation , the state - dependent feature of lower bound remains , which implies the null lower bound triviality @xcite .",
    "early attempts in searching the state - independent lower bounds led only to near - optimal results @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "this triviality problem was solved at length , by which the state - independent optimal trade - off relations for the variances of multiple observables are found to be obtainable , at least in principle is , see also @xcite for further development of uncertainty relations involving variances of multiple observables .",
    "it was noticed that the variance is inadequate in quantifying uncertainty , i.e. relabelling of the non - degenerate eigenvalues of an operator may alter the value of its variance @xcite . to overcome this problem , the concept of entropy was employed , and a typical uncertainty relation in entropy tells @xcite @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the shannon entroy , with @xmath9 the probability distribution of the eigenbasis @xmath10 of operator @xmath0 in measuring system , and similarly for @xmath11 .",
    "the bound @xmath12 is the maximum overlap of eigenbases of operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 and independent of the quantum state . to construct an optimal entropic uncertainty relation ,",
    "the key point is to find the best lower bound , which usually is a tough question for general observables @xcite and so far only the bounds for qubit system with shannon @xcite and collision entropies @xcite were obtained ( see also @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "the entropic uncertainty relation may in principle apply to multiple observables , of which in fact the state - independent lower bounds have been investigated for mutually unbiased bases @xcite , see ref.@xcite for a recent review .",
    "there are actually many types of entropies capable of characterizing the quantum uncertainty @xcite , e.g. , rnyi entropies @xmath13 with different indices of positive real numbers @xmath14 ( when @xmath15 it is shannon entropy ) .",
    "as there is no obvious reason why one type of entropy is superior to others in the context of uncertainty relation , a new characterization of uncertainty was introduced : the majorization of the probability distribution @xcite , which is closely related to the entropy .",
    "since both variance and entropy originate from the probability distribution of measurement , one may naturally ask : are these two types of uncertainty relations relavent or equivalent ? we find in this work that the answer is definite .    in the following",
    "we will present a general scheme on how to build quantitative relations between two prominent uncertainty measures , the variance and the entropy , which indicates that those two classes of uncertainty relations may actually be unified .",
    "the scheme can be sketched as follows : first construct a set of commutative operators for a given physical observable , then reconstruct the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes of the physical observable from the variances of operators in the set .",
    "based on the quantitative relation , we get various entropic uncertainty relations for qubit system from variance based uncertainty relations , which give optimal lower and upper bounds for arbitrary entropic measures and for multiple observables beyond mutually unbiased bases . moreover , new variance based uncertainty relations for high spin systems are also obtained from the entropic uncertainty relations .",
    "in quantum mechanics , a physical system can be generally described by density operator @xmath16 , which is a positive definite hermitian matrix ; and a physical observable is represented by a hermitian operator and may be expressed through the spectral decomposition latexmath:[$a = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\lambda_j    eigenvectors of @xmath0 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath18 .",
    "when measuring observable @xmath0 in a quantum system @xmath16 , only its eigenvalues @xmath18 are attainable with certain probability in every individual measurement . in @xmath16 ensemble , the probability of measuring @xmath18 reads @xmath19 .",
    "this statistical interpretation leads to two uncertainty measures , the variance and entropy , which are mathematically expressed as @xmath20 here , @xmath21 signifies variance defined as @xmath22-\\mathrm{tr}[\\rho a]^2 $ ] , and @xmath23 represents the rnyi entropy . notice that subtracting a constant from the operator does not change its variance and entropy , we are hence legitimate to treat the operators in following discussion to be traceless .",
    "following we exhibit an equivalence theorem , the main result of this work , which may quantitatively relate different uncertainty measures of discrete systems .    for a given physical observable @xmath0 in n - dimensional representation with eigenbases @xmath24 ,",
