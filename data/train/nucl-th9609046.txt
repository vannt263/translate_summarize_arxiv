    "large - basis no - core shell - model calculations have recently been performed @xcite . in these calculations",
    "all nucleons are active , which simplifies the effective interaction as no hole states are present . in the approach taken , the effective interaction is determined for a system of two nucleons only and subsequently used in the many - particle calculations . to take into account a part of the many - body effects a multi - valued effective interaction approach was introduced and applied in the no - core shell - model calculations @xcite and also tested in a model calculation @xcite .    in these shell - model calculations",
    "different approaches have been taken in deriving the two - nucleon effective interaction .",
    "all the methods employed , however , relied on the reference g - matrix method , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which leads to two - body matrix elements of a starting - energy - dependent g - matrix .",
    "to get rid of this unwanted dependence either a suitable parametrization was chosen @xcite or folded diagram effects were taken into account by calculating the derivatives of the g - matrix in an approximate way @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the lee - suzuki similarity - transformation approach @xcite to derive the two - body effective interaction .",
    "we try to avoid unnecessary approximations in performing the calculations .",
    "the harmonic - oscillator insertions are kept ; consequently , the effective interaction is @xmath4-dependent .",
    "also the hermitization of the effective interaction , which is , in general , non - hermitian , is done without approximations by a similarity transformation .",
    "we consider three possible ways of deriving the effective interaction .",
    "the first two are the standard iterative procedures , starting with the @xmath5-matrix calculation @xcite .",
    "we study the lee - suzuki vertex renormalization iteration , which makes use of the @xmath5-matrix derivatives . unlike most of the previous applications of this approach , we calculate these derivatives exactly employing the reference @xmath5-matrix derivatives .",
    "the other iterative procedure , usually refered to as krenciglowa - kuo technique , is carried out by diagonalizing the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian in subsequent iterations @xcite .",
    "this method has so far been applied only to model calculations .",
    "we also discuss its recent generalization @xcite . finally , we directly construct the effective interaction without calculating the @xmath5-matrix by employing the solutions of the two - body problem .",
    "when criteria necessary for convergence are the same for both iteration procedures , the resulting effective interactions obtained in all three methods are identical .",
    "the last method , however , has two advantages ; first , its simplicity , and second , the fact that it utilizes an explicit construction of the transformation operator .",
    "this transformation operator may then be used for the calculation of other effective operators .    to take partially into account the many - body effects neglected",
    "when using only a two - body effective interaction , we employ the recently introduced multi - vauled effective interaction approach @xcite .",
    "it was observed earlier @xcite that the two - body effective interaction derived by the vertex renormalization method is too attractive and leads to overbinding of the many - body system .",
    "we discuss this problem and believe that it is largely due to the uncompensated @xmath6 space part of the auxilliary harmonic - oscillator potential .",
    "we discuss possible treatment of this problem by modification of that part of the auxilliary potential .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss the shell model hamiltonian with the bound center - of - mass as well as the two - particle hamiltonian and the methods used to derive the starting - energy - independent effective interaction .",
    "results of the calculations for @xmath0h , @xmath1he , @xmath2he , @xmath3li , and @xmath3he are presented in section [ sec3 ] . in particular , we discuss the harmonic - oscillator frequency and the model - space - size dependences of the @xmath2he states .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in most shell model studies the one- and two - body hamiltonian for the a - nucleon system , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the nucleon mass and @xmath9 the nucleon - nucleon interaction , is modified by adding the center - of - mass harmonic oscillator potential @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    ". this potential does not influence intrinsic properties of the many - body system .",
    "it provides , however , a mean field felt by each nucleon and allows us to work with a convenient harmonic oscillator basis . for an alternative manipulation of the center - of - mass terms",

    "the intrinsic properties of the many - body system still do not depend on @xmath12 . from among the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ phamomega ] ) ,",

    "this can be achieved by projecting the center - of - mass eigenstates with energies greater than @xmath18 upwards in the energy spectrum .",

    "the removal of the spurious center - of - mass motion is exact .",
    "when going from eq.([phamomega ] ) to ( [ phamomegabeta ] ) , we added @xmath23 and subtracted @xmath24 , which has no effect on the intrinsic spectrum of states with the lowest center - of - mass configuration .",
    "the effective interaction should be determined from @xmath25 ( [ hamomega ] ) .",
    "calculation of the exact a - body effective interaction is , however , as difficult as finding the full space solution .",
    "usually , the effective interaction is approximated by a two - body effective interaction determined from a two - nucleon problem .",
    "the relevant two - nucleon hamiltonian obtained from ( [ hamomega ] ) is then @xmath26 this can be transformed to two - nucleon relative and center - of - mass parts by introducing the coordinates @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 yielding @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . while the center - of - mass part has the solution @xmath34 and the eigenvectors @xmath35 , the relative - coordinate part can be solved as a differential equation or , alternatively , can be diagonalized in a sufficiently large harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the latter possibility is , obviously , not applicable for hard - core potentials .",
    "the starting - energy - dependent effective interaction or g - matrix corresponding to a two - nucleon model space defined by the projector @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the interaction given by the last two terms on the rhs of eq.([hamomega2 ] ) . the g - matrix ( [ g ] ) can be constructed from the solutions of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) , by using the reference matrix method @xcite .",
    "the g - matrix can be expressed as    [ ggr]@xmath40    where @xmath41 is given by the first two terms on the rhs of eq.([hamomega2 ] ) and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath44 ( [ hamomega2 ] ) , respectively .    to obtain a starting - energy - independent effective interaction",
    ", one has to take into account the folded diagrams or , equivalently , to construct a similarity transformation that guarantees decoupling between the model space @xmath14 and the q - space .",
    "we employ the lee - suzuki @xcite similarity transformation method , which gives the effective interaction in the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 satisfying the equations @xmath47 and @xmath48 in this degenerate - model - space formulation two iterative solutions of the equation ( [ omega ] ) exist and lead to different expressions for the effective interaction .",
    "the first one , the krenciglowa - kuo ( kk ) iteration procedure @xcite , gives the for the n - th iteration formula @xmath49 in ( [ kkit ] ) the states @xmath50 are the right eigenvectors of @xmath51 belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath52 .",
    "the tilda states are the biorthogonal eigenvectors .",
    "when this procedure converges , it does so to the states which have the largest overlap with the model - space states .",
    "the resulting @xmath53 ( [ ls ] ) is independent of the starting energy @xmath54 .",
    "this method was recently generalized to a non - degenerate model space @xcite .",
    "the difference is in the starting iteration .",
    "when using ( [ kkit ] ) , the starting iteration is @xmath55 , while the non - degenerate model space version @xcite starts with @xmath56 here the @xmath57 are the unperturbed energies , in our case the two - nucleon harmonic - oscillator energies , and @xmath58 is the projector on the two - nucleon state @xmath59 . unlike in the original paper @xcite , we introduce a shift @xmath60 , as the g - matrix can not be evaluated for the energy @xmath57 , using the reference matrix method ( [ ggr ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ gdelta ] ) is the interaction used in the previous no - core shell - model studies @xcite with @xmath60 treated as a free parameter .",

    "this method , which relies on the g - matrix derivatives @xmath63 , was applied in shell - model calculations for the first time by poppelier and brussard @xcite . in that and most other applications different numerical approximations were used to evaluate the derivatives @xcite .",
    "in fact , these derivatives can be calculated exactly , because the reference matrix @xmath64 ( [ gr ] ) as well as the operator @xmath65 ( [ aeps ] ) can be differentiated to any order analytically , as can be seen when they are expressed in the two - nucleon harmonic - oscillator basis .",

    "then the @xmath66-th g - matrix derivative can be expressed as @xmath70 where the derivatives of the inverse matrix can be obtained from @xmath71 an alternative way of calculating g - matrix derivatives analytically was proposed in ref .",
    "when the convergence of ( [ verren ] ) is achieved , the effective interaction does not depend on the starting energy @xmath54 .",
    "the states reproduced in the model space are those lying closest to @xmath54 .    as our calculations start with exact solutions of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) , we are , in fact , in a position to construct the operator @xmath46 and , hence , the effective interaction directly from these solutions .",
    "let us denote the two - nucleon harmonic - oscillator states , which form the model space , as @xmath72 , and those which belong to the q - space , as @xmath73 .",
    "then the q - space components of the eigenvector @xmath43 of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) can be expressed as a combination of the p - space components with the help of the operator @xmath46 @xmath74 if the dimension of the model space is @xmath75 , we may choose a set @xmath76 of @xmath75 eigenevectors , for which the relation ( [ eigomega ] ) will be satisfied .",
    "under the condition that the @xmath77 matrix @xmath78 for @xmath79 is invertible , the operator @xmath46 can be determined from ( [ eigomega ] ) .",
    "note that in the present application the eigenvectors @xmath43 are direct products of the center - of - mass and the relative coordinate eigenvectors .",
    "the condition of invertibility is not satisfied for an arbitrary choice of the eigenvector set @xmath76 .",
    "once the operator @xmath46 is determined the effective hamiltonian can be constructed as follows from eq.([ls ] ) @xmath80 \\ ; .\\ ] ] it should be noted that @xmath81 for @xmath79 is a right eigenvector of ( [ effomega ] ) with the eigenvalue @xmath42 .    in the case",
    "when the iteration conditions are the same for both methods ( [ kkit ] ) and ( [ verren ] ) , and the set @xmath76 , for which eq.([eigomega ] ) is fulfilled , is chosen accordingly , all three methods lead to the identical effective hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian , when diagonalized in a model space basis , reproduces exactly the set @xmath76 of @xmath75 eigenvalues @xmath42 .",
    "note that the effective hamiltonian is , in general , non - hermitian , or more accurately quasi - hermitian .",
    "it can be hermitized by a similarity transformation . when the direct method ( [ eigomega],[effomega ] ) is used the similarity transformation",
    "is determined from the metric operator @xmath82 .",
    "the hermitian hamiltonian is then given by @xcite @xmath83^{\\frac{1}{2 } } h_{\\rm 2eff}\\left[p_2(1+\\omega^\\dagger\\omega ) p_2\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] when the iteration methods ( [ kkit ] ) or ( [ verren ] ) are employed , the @xmath46 operator is not determined . in previous applications",
    "@xcite , the hermitization was usually done by averaging the conjugate matrix elements .",

    "@xcite , if @xmath84 is a matrix , which diagonalizes @xmath85 , @xmath86 , then the metric operator can be expressed as @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , it follows that the hermitized @xmath88 is obtained from @xmath89^{\\frac{1}{2 } } h_{\\rm 2eff}\\left[s^\\dagger s\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }    \\ ; .\\ ] ] finally , the two - body effective interaction used in the shell - model calculation is determined from the two - nucleon effective hamiltonian as @xmath90 .",
    "in this section we apply the methods for calculating the two - body effective interaction outlined in section [ sec2 ] and , with the obtained interactions , we perform no - core shell - model calculations for nuclei with @xmath91 .",
    "we use a complete @xmath15 model space with , e.g. , @xmath92 for the positive - parity states of @xmath1he .",
    "this means that 9 major harmonic - oscillator shells may be occupied in this case .",
    "the two - nucleon model space is defined in our calculations by @xmath93 , e.g. , for an @xmath94 calculation for @xmath1he @xmath95 .",
    "the restriction of the harmonic - oscillator shell occupation is given by @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the same conditions hold for the relative @xmath99 , center - of - mass @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , quantum numbers .    in the present calculations we use the reid 93 nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite .",
    "for @xmath1he we make a comparison with the nijmegen ii potential @xcite with corrected @xmath102 wave @xcite .",
    "we work in the isospin formalism and do not include the coulomb interaction .",
    "the np channel interactions of reid 93 and nijmegen ii are used .",
    "first , let us compare the different methods for calculating the starting - energy - independent effective interaction .",
    "the kk method ( [ kkit ] ) works well for @xmath103 .",
    "then the convergence is achieved usually after less than 15 iterations and the model space eigenvalues differ from the full space eigenvalues , which are of the order of @xmath104 mev , by not more than @xmath105 mev .",
    "note that the reference g - matrix ( [ gr ] ) becomes singular for @xmath106 .",
    "consequently , exact eigenvalues can not be reproduced when the reference g - matrix method is applied for calculating the g - matrix .",
    "however , this singularity causes no problem when the iteration is stopped after achieving the above mentioned precision .",
    "when the starting iteration ( [ gdelta ] ) is used instead of @xmath55 , usually a few iteration steps are saved . as to the starting energy ,",
    "@xmath107 is a possible choice . in most calculations we used negative values for @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath60 a non - zero value must be chosen , we used typically about -5 mev .",
    "the resulting effective interaction is not dependent on these choices , and they also do not affect the number of iterations significantly . for @xmath108 divergence in some channels can be encountered and , moreover , the calculation becomes time consuming .",
    "the application of the vertex - renormalization method ( [ verren ] ) requires the g - matrix derivatives .",
    "the matrix elements of the g - matrix derivatives decrease rapidly but , on the other hand , they are multiplied by effective - interaction matrices of increasing powers .",
    "consequently , the overall convergence is rather slow for larger model spaces .",
    "also the rate of convergence differs for different states .",
    "when the starting energy is chosen below the ground state energy , the fastest convergence is achieved for the lowest states , which have the largest overlap with the model space .",
    "this is the same observation as found in the model calculations @xcite .",
    "the rate of convergence is very sensitive to the choice of the starting energy @xmath54 .",
    "the closer to the ground state , the faster the convergence . on the other hand ,",
    "serious numerical problems occur when a higher number of iterations is required .",
    "these problems are related to the above mentioned fact that we multiply very small numbers by very big numbers when calculating higher iterations . to achieve the same accuracy as with the previous method , often more than 30 iterations are needed , and to curb the numerical difficulties real*16 precision is neccessary .",
    "these facts make this method rather impractical .",
    "it is also difficult to apply this method for model spaces with @xmath109 .",
    "let us point out that new iteration methods were suggested recently , which combine some features of both methods studied here @xcite .",
    "these techniques are more involved from the computational point of view , and we did not try to use them .",
    "they may , however , remedy some of the difficulties found in our applications .",
    "the simplest and the most straightforward way to calculate the two - body effective interaction is accomplished by solving the equation ( [ eigomega ] ) and constructing the effective hamiltonian according to eq.([effomega ] ) .",
    "the easiest way to perform the calculations is in the center - of - mass and relative coordinate basis and afterwards to do the transformation to the two - nucleon harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "note that @xmath46 is diagonal in the center - of - mass quantum numbers @xmath110 as well as in @xmath111 .",
    "consequently , the sum in eq.([eigomega ] ) goes only over @xmath112 for the basis states classified by @xmath113 .",
    "an important point is the right choice of the eigenstates in the set @xmath76 . for each @xmath114",
    "we must choose as many relative coordinate eigenstates as the allowed number of @xmath115 combinations .",
    "these are determined from the condition @xmath116 .",
    "since the harmonic - oscillator basis is infinite , we make a truncation in the q - space by keeping only the states with @xmath117 .",
    "note that @xmath118 for the coupled channels and @xmath119 for the uncoupled channels .",
    "this method can be easily applied to calculate the effective interaction up to @xmath95 , as required in the present shell - model calculations .    to take partially into account the many - body effects neglected",
    "when using only a two - body effective interaction , we employ the recently introduced multi - valued effective interaction approach @xcite . in this approach",
    "different effective interactions are used for different @xmath120 excitations .",
    "the effective interactions then carry an additional index indicating the sum of the oscillator quanta for the spectators , @xmath121 , defined by @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final many - body states , respectively , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final two - nucleon states @xmath59 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "different sets of the effective interaction are determined for different model spaces characterized by @xmath121 and defined by projection operators    [ projop]@xmath128    this multi - valued effective - interaction approach is superior to the traditional single - valued effective interaction , as confirmed also in a model calculation @xcite .",
    "the shell - model diagonalization is performed by using the many - fermion - dynamics shell - model code @xcite .",
    "we present the results for @xmath91 nuclei in tables [ tab1]-[tab5 ] .",
    "it has been observed earlier @xcite and it is apparent in the present calculations as well that , when the effective interaction is derived using the lee - suzuki method , the interaction becomes too strong and leads to overbinding of nuclei .",
    "the problem is not in the calculational method but rather in the fact that the original two - nucleon hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) is flawed if @xmath129 .",
    "the difficulty is that while the relative - coordinate harmonic - oscillator auxiliary potential is exactly cancelled in the equation ( [ hamomega ] ) , it is not fully cancelled when the effective interaction is derived from the two - nucleon hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) .",
    "this can be seen , for example , when the nucleon - nucleon interaction is switched off .",
    "then from eq.([hamomega2 ] ) we obtain an effective interaction derived from the relative - coordinate harmonic - oscillator potential , which will be different from the model - space part of the harmonic - oscillator potential , appearing in eq.([phamomegabeta ] ) .",
    "clearly , the @xmath130-space part of the relative - coordinate harmonic - oscillator potential is responsible for this effect . in order to reduce this spurious effect of the auxiliary potential on the effective interaction ,",
    "we introduce an _ ad hoc _ modification of the relative - coordinate two - nucleon q - space part of the auxiliary potential as follows @xmath131 here we have introduced a constant @xmath132 ; for @xmath133 we get the original hamiltonian appearing in eq.([hamomega2r ] ) . moreover , for @xmath134 the harmonic - oscillator dependence vanishes and for @xmath135 the relative - coordinate part of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2r ] ) is recovered . in eq.([hamomega2rm ] ) the q - space harmonic - oscillator potential is made more shallow and is shifted .",
    "the shift is such that the p - space and the q - space potentials are equal for @xmath136 , with this mean value determined for the eigenstates of the relative - coordinate harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian appearing in eq .",
    "( [ hamomega2r ] ) . in this modified hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2rm ] ) , a quasi - particle scattered into the q - space feels a weaker auxiliary potential .",
    "note that an alternative method by krenciglowa _",
    "@xcite for deriving the g - matrix , as opposed to that we employ here @xcite , uses plane - wave - type intermediate q - space states , that is , no auxiliary potential at all . for a recent review of this approach see ref .",
    "our present modification , in fact , brings those two methods closer together .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2rm ] ) by diagonalization in a harmonic - oscillator basis characterized by @xmath137 with the radial quantum number @xmath138 .",
    "the error caused by this truncation of the harmonic - oscillator basis can be estimated for @xmath133 , when the system can be solved as a differential equation .",
    "we found that the low - lying eigenvalues obtained in the two calculations do not differ by more than @xmath139 mev and in most cases by much less .",
    "the lowest eigenvalues are typically of the order of @xmath140 mev .",
    "the diagonalization can not be used for hard - core nucleon - nucleon potentials , but for the soft - core reid 93 and nijmegen ii potentials the interaction matrix elements can be evaluated straightforwardly .",
    "note that the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2rm ] ) depends on @xmath93 and the projection operators .",
    "when the multi - valued effective interaction is calculated , solutions are found only for projectors and @xmath93 corresponding to @xmath141 .",
    "the value @xmath95 is used in most calculations . using these solutions , all required sets of effective interactions",
    "are constructed .",
    "the question arises if the modification we introduced in eq .",
    "( [ hamomega2rm ] ) may not cause center - of - mass spurious contamination of the physical states .",
    "we note that the modification is done only in the q - space part of the auxiliary potential and , most importantly , with regard to the two - nucleon relative coordinate . in conjuction with this",
    ", our choice of the two - nucleon model space as well as the complete @xmath15 model space for the many - nucleon states prevents the center - of - mass contamination of physical states .",
    "we have tested numerically for possible spurious center - of - mass contaminations by varying the parameter @xmath20 , introduced in eq.([phamomegabeta ] ) , in calculations for several systems and found that the physical states remain unchanged for different choices of @xmath20 , including @xmath142 , even if @xmath143 .",

    "the effective interaction for this calculation has been derived from eq.([hamomega2rm ] ) with the same @xmath147 but different @xmath155 .",
    "we observe large sensitivity for the higher excited states on changes in @xmath120 with the exception of @xmath156 .",
    "this state , dominated by the @xmath157 configuration , is a good candidate for the experimental @xmath158 state .",
    "note also the significant shifts of the excited states , again with the exception of @xmath156 and @xmath159 , downwards in energy , when the model space is enlarged .",
    "even if we can not draw a definitive conclusion , these facts indicate that excited states obtained in the calculation , but unobserved , may be states , which do not correspond to @xmath2he internal excitations .",
    "the calculated results for @xmath3li are presented in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "a 6@xmath120 calculation was performed for the positive - parity states using @xmath160 mev obtained from ( [ hbaromega ] ) . again",
    "the effective interaction , derived from the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) , is too strong and overbinds the system .",
    "the calculation with the modified hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2rm ] ) gives very reasonable agreement with experiment for all properties shown .",
    "in addition to the experimental states presented in the table [ tab4 ] , another @xmath161 state with the excitation energy 15.8 mev is known .",
    "the lowest @xmath161 2@xmath120 state obtained in our @xmath147 calculation has an energy of 13.840 mev , with a main configuration of @xmath162 .",
    "another candidate for this experimental state may be the calculated state with an excitation energy of 18.378 mev , dominated by the configurations @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "likely , the latter state may be more stable against model space and @xmath120 variations .",
    "we also performed a 5@xmath120 calculation for the negative - parity states of @xmath3li .",
    "the lowest calculated state is @xmath165 with an excitation energy 9.135 mev , followed by @xmath166 ( @xmath167=9.335 mev ) and @xmath168 ( @xmath167=11.372 mev ) .",
    "such states have not been observed experimentaly .    in table",
    "[ tab5 ] we present the @xmath3he characteristics .",
    "as isospin symmetry is not broken in the present calculations , the energies are the same as those for @xmath3li with @xmath169 .",
    "in addition , the proton and neutron radii are evaluated .",
    "reasonable agreement with the experimantal values is found .",
    "contrary to the previous no - core shell - model calculations @xcite , the effective interaction used in the present calculations does not contain a parameter @xmath60 adjusted for each nucleus in order to get a reasonable binding energy .",
    "besides the model - space size , the present calculations depend only on the harmonic - oscillator frequency @xmath120 and on the parameter @xmath146 , appearing in the relative coordinate two - nucleon hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2rm ] ) , which distinguishes the structure of the p - space from that of the q - space . for the results presented in tables [ tab1]-[tab5 ] , we chose @xmath120 according to formula ( [ hbaromega ] ) and @xmath146 was fixed to reproduce the result of the exact @xmath0h calculation . consequently , our calculations contain no variable parameters and meaningful comparisons can be made between our calculated binding energies and the quantities derived from them and the experimental values as well as the results of other calculations .    in this regard , we note the recent calculation of valence energies of @xmath3he and @xmath3li and the neutron separation energy of @xmath2he , using the two - frequency shell - model approach @xcite . for example , our calculation with @xmath147 and the reid 93 potential gives for the neutron separation energy of @xmath2he , @xmath170 mev to be compared with the experimental value of @xmath171 mev .",
    "similarly , the valence energy of @xmath3he is found to be @xmath172=-3.151\\ ; { \\rm mev}$ ] , compared with the experimental @xmath173 mev .",
    "furthermore , @xmath174=-6.845\\ ; { \\rm mev}$ ] , where we used @xmath175 mev from table [ tab3 ] , as the coulomb contributions , not taken into account in the calculations , more or less cancel . here",
    "the experimental value is @xmath176 mev .",
    "we observe good agreement of these quantities with the experimental values , in fact , better than that obtained in ref .",
    "apparently , the reason for these improved results is the size of the model space , which is much larger in our calculations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite concerns were raised about the stability of @xmath3li to the @xmath177 threshold in previous no - core calculations @xcite . from the present results we deduce that @xmath3li",
    "is bound against this threshold by 1.314 mev , compared with the experimental value of 1.474 mev .",
    "note that the deuteron is treated exactly in our formalism , @xmath178 mev .",
    "to arrive at the present number , we used the coulomb energy contributions to binding energy @xmath179 mev and @xmath180 mev .",
    "another issue raised in ref .",
    "@xcite was sign of the quadrupole moment of @xmath3li .",
    "as in the previous no - core calculations @xcite , we also get the sign correctly in our @xmath147 calculation . clearly , this is a consequence of a reasonable effective interaction and a large enough model space .",
    "in the present paper we have presented different ways of constructing a starting - energy - independent two - body effective interaction . in particular",
    ", we studied the lee - suzuki similarity transformation method and compared two different iteration schemes for obtaining a solution , the vertex renormalization method and the krenciglowa - kuo method . when applying the vertex renormalization method",
    ", we obtained the derivatives of the g - matrix exactly by using the derivatives of the reference g - matrix .",
    "a third approach involved a direct calculation of the transformation operator @xmath46 . when the convergence conditions of the iteration methods are satisfied , all three approaches lead to the same two - body effective interaction .",
    "our conclusion is that , for large model spaces that we employ , the only viable option is the direct calculation method . for large model spaces ( @xmath109 ) , the iteration methods either fail to converge or the calculations are time consuming or both .    unlike in most previous applications , where the non - hermitian effective interaction was hermitized by averaging the conjugate matrix elements , we hermitize the effective interaction exactly using a similarity transformation .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the averaging is a good approximation for the hermitian @xmath181 and @xmath182 effective interactions .",
    "we observe here , however , that for large model spaces , like those we employ , the non - hermiticity could be significant .",
    "it is certainly preferable to work with the exactly hermitized interaction .    employing the derived effective interaction ,",
    "we have performed shell - model calculations , in which up to 9 major harmonic - oscillator shells may be occupied . in order to take into account part of the many - body effects",
    ", we utilized the new multi - valued effective interaction approach @xcite .",
    "the results for no - core , full @xmath15 calculations are given for nuclei with @xmath91 .",
    "the effective interaction was derived from the reid 93 nucleon - nucleon potential , but calculations were also made with nijmegen ii potential for comparison . as observed earlier @xcite , when the lee - suzuki method is applied for a two - nucleon system with a harmonic - oscillator auxiliary potential , the resulting effective interaction is too strong and leads to overbinding of the many - body system .",
    "this problem is caused by incomplete cancellation of the relative coordinate part of the auxiliary potential . to mend this flaw",
    ", we introduced a modification of the q - space part of the relative - coordinate two - nucleon hamiltonian , from which the effective interaction is calculated . in effect",
    "this weakens the auxiliary potential in the q - space .    in the present calculations , besides the model space size , the only free parameters are the harmonic - oscillator frequency @xmath120 and the parameter modifing the two - nucleon hamiltonian , as discussed above .",
    "the latter parameter was fixed from the @xmath0h binding energy calculation ( fitted to the result of an exact @xmath0h calculation ) and @xmath120 was taken from the phenomenological formula ( [ hbaromega ] ) . hence , unlike previous no - core calculations , we are able to compare , for nuclei other than @xmath0h , quantities derived from binding energies , such as valence energies , with experiment .    for most calculated characteristics we found good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "in agreement with the previous observation @xcite , we found that the reid 93 and nijmegen ii potentials give very similar results .",
    "the question of low - lying positive - parity states in @xmath2he was also investigated .",
    "we observed that the calculated low - lying positive - parity states have not converged , regarding changes in the model - space size and variations in @xmath120 .",
    "this may indicate that they do not correspond to internal excitations of @xmath2he .",
    "however , we are not in a position to make a conclusive statement concerning this issue .    because we derive the transformation operator @xmath46 explicitly in our calculations , we are able to use it for calculating any effective operator , employing the approaches discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in a similar way as in our model calculations @xcite .",
    "besides calculating other effective operators , we also intend to extend the calculations to larger @xmath4 .",
