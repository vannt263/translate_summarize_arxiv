    "heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite , which lies at the heart of understanding quantum mechanics , provides a dramatic illustration of a qualitative distinction between quantum and classical physics .",
    "this principle states that there is general irreducible lower bound on the uncertainty in the result of simultaneous measurement of two conjugate quantum mechanical variables , such as position and momentum , and more precisely , the product of the uncertainties in such two measurements is at least of order @xmath1 , or equivalently , there is an upper bound on the accuracy with which the values of noncommunity observables can be simultaneously prepared .    due to the appearance of information theory , a more natural choice to measure uncertainty",
    "is based on entropy @xcite . for non - commuting observables",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 , deutsch @xcite has described the relation as [ u1 ] s_h(q)+s_h(r)-2 _ 2 ( 1+c ) , where @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote two hermitian operators representing physical observables in an @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8=1, ... ,@xmath5 ) the respective complete sets of normalized eigenvectors and @xmath9 . particularly , kraus @xcite suggested that this relation may be improved to s_h(q)+s_h(r)_2 .",
    "[ eur1 ] a distinct advantage of these relations , ( [ u1 ] ) and ( [ eur1 ] ) , over the standard deviations is that the right - hand side is independent of the state of the system when the two measurements @xmath2 and @xmath3 do not share any common eigenvector , i.e , it gives a fixed lower bound .",
    "so , they provide us a more general framework to quantify uncertainty",
    ".    however , using previously determined quantum information about the measured system , the above uncertainty bound could be violated . to overcome this defect , recently refs . @xcite",
    "have given a stronger entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) based on conditional entropy theoretically .",
    "furthermore , several experiments @xcite have been performed to confirm this eur . for an entangled quantum system consisting of interesting particle @xmath10 and its quantum memory @xmath0 , which is a device that might be available in the not - too - distant future and could store the information of the entanglement between particles @xcite , the conditional entropy eur is shown as s_v(q|a)+s_v(r|a)_2+s_v(b|a ) , [ eur2 ] where @xmath11 is the conditional von neumann entropy . in the extreme case , i.e. , @xmath0 and @xmath10",
    "are maximally entangled , it is able to predict the outcomes precisely . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath10 are not entangled , the bound in ( [ eur1 ] ) is recovered .",
    "the generalization of the eur ( [ eur2 ] ) to rnyi entropy has also been given @xcite .",
    "other studies from various views can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that every quantum system , whatever it is , in a realistic regime is inevitably in contact with environments . as a result",
    ", the considered quantum system has to suffer a decoherence or dissipation .",
    "so the nature of environment plays a key role in dominating the evolution of the quantum system , as well as the quantum - memory - assisted eur @xcite . besides the generally studied noisy channels , such as bit flip , noises resulting from the motions of observers or gravitational field are also a very important branch of quantum noisy channels .",
    "especially , such noises directly relate to the nature of spacetime , such as hawing effect , and allow us to incorporate the concepts of quantum information into relativistic settings .",
    "this combination has recently resulted in an entire novel field of physics , relativistic quantum information @xcite .",
    "its aim is to answer questions about the overlap of relativity and the manipulation of information stored in quantum system , provide us a more completely frame to understand quantum information theoretically , and more importantly be a guidance for future realistic quantum information assignments in curved spacetime .",
    "so such works are very meaningful .",
    "j. feng et al in recent work @xcite has studied how the unruh effect affects the eur , which is the first try to discuss how the motion of the observer affects the heisenberg s limit . however",
    ", their analysis is confined in the flat spacetime and the effects result only from the motion of observer .",
    "therefore , it remains interesting to see what happens to the eur if the quantum system is placed in a curved spacetime rather than a flat one .    in this paper , we will study the eur ( [ eur2 ] ) under the decoherence rooting in vacuum field fluctuation in the de sitter space .",
    "the reason for special attention to the de sitter space in recent years is that our current observations , together with the theory of inflation , suggest that our universe may approach the de sitter geometries in the far past and the far future . and",
    "a duality may exist between quantum gravity on the de sitter space and a conformal field theory living on the boundary identified with the timelike infinity of it @xcite .",
    "so , many fields , such as fields quantization @xcite , lamb shift @xcite and spontaneous excitation of atom @xcite , have been studied in this special curved spacetime , and it is necessary for us to focus on this spacetime to study eur .",
    "the model we will study is constructed like this : the quantum memory @xmath0 , which interacts with quantized conformally coupled massless scalar fields in the de sitter - invariant vacuum , freely falls or keeps static in spacetime .",
    "another particle @xmath10 , isolated from external field , denotes the system to be measured .",
    "they initially entangles with each other maximally .",
    "no matter which case , we find the quantum memory @xmath0 , due to the fluctuation of vacuum field , will suffer from the thermal effect of spacetime , which acts as a type of noise channel . under this noise",
    "channel the quantum information stored initially in @xmath0 would be decreased , thus , leading to an inevitably increase of the uncertainty on the outcome of measurements performed by observer . along with the evolution of the quantum state ,",
    "the uncertainty eventually achieve a finite maximal value .",
    "this phenomenon is essentially similar to that reported in @xcite where entanglement transfers between the quantum system and its environment .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : after briefly reviewing evolution of the quantum system and simply representing the entropic uncertainty relation in section [ section 2 ] , we calculate and discuss the entropic uncertainty with particle @xmath0 freely falling in the de sitter space in section [ section 3 ] and with particle @xmath0 keeping static in section [ section 4 ] .",
    "then , we will try to explain the possible mechanism in section v before summarizing our conclusions in section [ section 5 ] .",
    "we will discuss the evolution of quantum system and the entropic uncertainty .",
    "let s start with the hamiltonian of the system containing particle and external field , which can be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the hamiltonian of the particle and scalar field , respectively , and @xmath15 represents their interaction . for simplicity , we take a two - level particle with hamiltonian @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy level spacing , and @xmath18 is the pauli matrix . we suppose that the hamiltonian representing the interaction between particle and scalar field is @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is a coupling constant , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the rasing ( lowering ) operator , and @xmath23 corresponds to the scalar field operator , which is conformally coupled to de sitter space .",
    "although there are kinds of coupling ways , only the conformal coupling preserves the de sitter - invariant vacuum states , the others are those which break de sitter vacuum invariance @xcite .",
    "we assume that initially the two - level particle and field states are uncorrelated so that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the reduced density matrix of the two - level particle , and @xmath26 is the vacuum state of the field .",
    "for the total system , its equation of motion in schrodinger picture is @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the proper time of the two - level particle . in the limit of weak coupling",
    ", the evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath29 , after some calculations , can be written in the lindblad form @xcite @xmath30+\\sum^3_{j=1}\\left[2 l_j\\rho l_j^\\dagger-\\left\\{l_j^\\dagger l_j,\\rho\\right\\}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes an anticommutator , @xmath32 is the effective hamiltonian , and @xmath33 are the lindblad operators , which are given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    in our setup , we take two particles , keeping one of them particle @xmath10 isolated from external field while the other particle @xmath0 interacts with the environment .",
    "it is needed to note that this model is in structural similarity to a bipartite quantum system in quantum information theory , with one subsystem in interaction with external environment , and the other isolated from that . in this regard ,",
    "let s note that this model has been used to discuss the loss of spin entanglement for accelerated electrons in electric magnetic fields @xcite , and the entanglement of two qubits in a relativistic orbit @xcite . since @xmath38 spans a sixteen dimensional vector space and the direct product of pauli matrices including the identity , @xmath39 , form sixteen linearly independent vectors , we can expand the density matrix as @xmath40 a nice property about this choice of basis is that the expansion coefficients @xmath41 are real , which follows from the hermiticity of the pauli matrices and density operator . substituting ( [ eqn : arbintialdensity ] ) into eq .",

    "the reason why we select the @xmath47 to be measured is that they are the spin polarization components of the two - level atom , we can not simultaneously have complete information about both the observables @xmath48 and @xmath49 , i.e , they have met the conditions that eur ( 1.3 ) requires .",
    "moreover , the pauli operators are hermitian , so @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two positive operator valued measurements ( povms ) acting on particle @xmath10 .      since @xmath58 ,",
    "the associated entropy is binary @xmath59 , and @xmath60 denoted as the binary entropy . for a particular measurement of @xmath48 and @xmath49 by observer",

    "@xmath63 , where the sum of @xmath64 actually means the uncertainty about the outcomes of measurement @xmath48 and @xmath49 simultaneously given information stored in a quantum memory @xmath0 .",

    "are the ones that we actually need . for different evolutions , parameters",

    "we now consider particle @xmath0 freely falls and interacts with a quantized conformally coupled massless scalar field in the de sitter space .",
    "there are several different coordinate systems can be chosen to characterize the de sitter space @xcite . here",

    "the canonical quantization of scalar field with this metric has been done in @xcite , in the massless and conformal coupling limit , the wightman function for a freely - falling particle @xmath0 can be simplified to be @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath86 where the last term of @xmath32 represents the lamb shift @xcite in the de sitter space .",
    "then , we can get @xmath87 and @xmath71 for this case .    from eq .",

    "so what influence the temperature has on the entropic uncertainty , depicted in fig . 1 .     ( dashed line ) and @xmath71 ( solid line ) as a function of proper time , @xmath28 , in units of @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the spontaneous emission rate . the above two lines ( blue colour ) and the below two lines ( cyan colour ) correspond to @xmath93 ( which is assumed ) and @xmath90 , in units of @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "1 , for @xmath94 , namely , @xmath0 and @xmath10 remain being maximally entangled , @xmath95 , satisfying the eur ( [ eur2 ] ) , which means that one can predict the outcomes precisely . as time goes on ,",
    "the uncertainty bound @xmath71 is lifted , meanwhile the uncertainty @xmath61 is also changed , but they still meet the eur ( [ eur2 ] ) . finally , the uncertainty reaches a finite maxima value , about @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , we observe that with @xmath93 the measurement outcome is more uncertain than that frees from thermal effect during the whole evolution , so we can arrive at the conclusion that the thermal nature of the de sitter space surely increases the uncertainty .",
    "the possible mechanism behind this phenomenon will be studied in the following section .",
    "next we will discuss under the same spacetime background for static particle @xmath0 . on this occasion , we choose to work in the static coordinate system , and the line element is @xmath98 this metric possesses a event horizon at @xmath99 , generally named as cosmological horizon .",
    "note that the coordinates @xmath100 only cover part of the de sitter space , just like the rindler wedge in a flat spacetime .",
    "and the relation between the static and global coordinates system is @xmath101 obviously , the worldline @xmath102 in the static coordinate coincides with the worldline @xmath103 in the global coordinate , and an particle at rest with @xmath104 in the static coordinate will be accelerated relative to the observer at rest in the global coordinate with @xmath103 , which is described by @xmath105    similarly , in the static coordinates system by solving the field equation , one can find a set of complete eigenmodes @xcite . defining a de sitter - invariant vacuum , we can calculate the wightman function for the massless conformally coupled scalar field , for static @xmath0 , it is represented as @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 . then , we can easily acquire @xmath109 in this case , static @xmath0 feels a temperature @xmath110 in the de sitter space . however it is needed to note that there remain differences from what was obtained in the case of the freely failing @xmath0 @xmath111 , we can connect these two temperatures by @xmath112 in which the first term is the square of the gibbons - hawking temperature of the de sitter space , and the second term is related to the unruh temperature , which depends on proper acceleration described by eq.([proper acceleraion ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath113 varies with the rest position @xmath114 , so located at different positions , particle @xmath0 feels a different temperature @xmath113 , and the von neumann entropy will have a remarkable change .",
