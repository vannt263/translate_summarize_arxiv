    "the @xmath1be(@xmath7)@xmath8b reaction , at energies of approximately 20  kev , plays an important role in the production of solar neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the subsequent decay of the @xmath8b is the source of the high energy neutrinos to which many solar neutrino detectors are sensitive .",

    "the definition of the @xmath0  factor eliminates from it most of the energy dependence due to coulomb repulsion by factoring out the penetration to the origin of a particle in the coulomb potential of a point charge .",
    "however , it does not make the @xmath0  factor energy independent , as there are still energy dependences due to the structure of the final bound state , resonances and the attenuation of the barrier by the nuclear mean field . the reaction rate , obtained by folding the thermal distribution of nuclei in the stellar core with the cross section , peaks at approximately 20  kev . because the cross section diminishes exponentially at low energies ,",
    "the only method of obtaining information about the @xmath0 factor at energies of astrophysical interest is to extrapolate data taken at experimentally accessible energies ( @xmath14  kev ) . to do the extrapolation",

    "it has been established @xcite that this behavior stems from a pole in the @xmath0 factor when the photon energy , @xmath16 vanishes .",
    "we develop two key concepts for the description of the astrophysical @xmath0 factor : the pole where the photon energy vanishes and an effective hard sphere radius .",
    "these concepts will be developed and explored by modeling the complicated multi - dimensional many - body system with simple one - body models .",
    "the pole term describes and is dominated by coulomb physics .",
    "it depends on nuclear physics through the separation energy , the asymptotic normalization of the final state wave function and the spectroscopic factors .",

    "this will be determined by a fit to the @xmath0-factor data .",
    "an effective hard sphere repulsion is introduced to approximate how the nuclear physics influences the energy dependence , and is related primarily to the non - resonant phase shift of the initial scattering state .",
    "the effective hard - sphere radius is determined by comparing the hard - sphere model to more complete models such as potential models .",
    "elastic scattering data from protons on @xmath1be , if it existed , would help constrain the potential models and through them the effective hard shpere radius . as",
    "such data are presently unavailable , the constraints must come from the elastic scattering of neutrons from @xmath1li , the mirror system .",
    "the concepts of the pole and the hard sphere repulsion lead to a simple rational approximation for the energy dependence of the @xmath0 factor , which encompasses the dominant physics at low energy .",
    "this simple approach breaks down as the energy increases and the capture becomes more sensitive to the internal structure of the @xmath1be core .",
    "we explore the range of validity of the simple one - dimensional model by comparing it with more sophisticated potential , @xmath17matrix , and microscopic cluster models . in general",
    ", the simple approach agrees with the potential and @xmath17matrix models over a larger energy range .",

    "we present a brief overview of the model .",
    "the @xmath18 contribution to the @xmath0 factor for the @xmath1be(@xmath7)@xmath8b reaction may be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 in eq .",

    "the extra factor of @xmath26 in the integrand comes from the photon wave function .",
    "the final bound state wave function @xmath27 is normalized in the asymptotic region to @xmath28 while the initial wave function reduces to the regular coulomb wave function divided by @xmath29 .",
    "the unusual choice of normalizations is just to simplify the mathematics and generate integrals that are well - behaved at threshold .",
    "the initial state has both coulomb and nuclear distortions .",
    "the coulomb distortions are large and give the penetration factor included in the definition of the @xmath0 factor , eq .",
    "( [ eq - define ] ) .",
    "they are included in all calculations .",
    "the nuclear distortions are much smaller but they are important and introduce a significant model dependence into the calculations , as described in the next section .    the absolute magnitude of the @xmath0 factor is determined primarily by the spectroscopic factor and the asymptotic normalization ( see also ref .",
    "the spectroscopic factor contains many - body aspects of the problem and is calculable from standard shell model theory .",
    "the asymptotic normalization also depends on the many - body wave function , but is far more difficult to estimate from first principles : it requires detailed knowledge of how the 8-body wave function extends beyond the nuclear potential and its mapping to the whittaker function in this region .",
    "this may be estimated crudely by approximating that behavior by using a suitably chosen woods - saxon wave function for the weakly bound proton .",
    "instead we treat the overall factor , @xmath30 , as a free parameter , which is independent of energy , and determined by the @xmath0-factor data . for simplicity we will refer to this combination of asymptotic normalization and spectroscopic factor as the asymptotic strength .    to investigate the behavior of the integrals in eq .",

    "the @xmath4-wave integral then becomes @xmath33 the integral is smooth as @xmath25 passes through zero and diverges as @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "the whittaker function is proportional to @xmath36@xcite ( @xmath37 is independent of @xmath25 ) . above threshold",

    "both the leading and first correction terms are determined purely by the asymptotic behavior of the wave functions . the second correction term , of order @xmath46 ,",
    "is not determined purely by the asymptotic value of wave function alone but also depends on the wave function at finite @xmath26 .",
    "the presence of the pole suggests the @xmath0 factor may be parametrized as a laurent series : @xmath47 the coefficients of the first two terms , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are determined purely by the asymptotic forms of the wave functions while the third coefficient , @xmath50 , is also dependent on the short range properties of the wave functions .",
    "the validity of such an approximation is discussed below .",
    "the energy dependence in the @xmath0 factor enters through the @xmath4- and @xmath51-wave integrals , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the phase - space factor , @xmath54 . to investigate that behavior",

    "a woods - saxon potential model , denoted b1 , whose radius ( 2.39  fm ) and diffuseness ( 0.65  fm ) were taken from barker @xcite , was used to calculate the bound state and nuclear distortions .",
    "a potential depth of @xmath5546.6  mev was chosen to reproduce the binding energy of the final state .",
    "no spin - orbit force was included .",
    "the integrands are peaked at very large radii : 40  fm and 55  fm for the @xmath4- and @xmath51-wave integrands , respectively , and extend well beyond 100  fm . as this is well outside the range of the nuclear potential ( @xmath56  fm for @xmath1be @xcite ) ,",
    "the capture is purely coulombic . to ensure complete convergence in our calculations we integrated to 1000  fm .",
    "the small negative contribution and the node in the @xmath4-wave integral near 0  fm arise from the effects of the nuclear distortion .",
    "the distortion in the @xmath51-wave component is negligible .",
    "we show the integrands for a range of energies in fig .",
    "[ fig-1p5 ] .",
    "the peaks in the integrands , which are displayed by the solid lines , are outside the range of the nuclear force even at 1.5  mev .",
    "two other calculations , in which the nuclear distortion is varied , are also presented .",
    "the pure coulomb calculation , eq .",
    "( [ eq - coul ] ) , contains no nuclear distortions and is displayed by the dot - dashed line .",
    "the other curve ( dashed line ) matches the full calculation at large distances so it has the same nuclear phase shift at large radii but the initial wave function is integrated to small radii using just the coulomb potential . in the @xmath4-wave integrands the nuclear distortions play an important role , especially near the origin .",
    "these distortions produce a node in the scattering wave function and give a repulsive phase shift .",
    "the node is necessary to make the scattering wave function orthogonal to the bound @xmath57-shell protons in the @xmath1be core . that orthogonality is preserved only if the node in the scattering state is at a radius where the bound state wave function is still appreciable .",
    "hence the node will be close to but inside the nuclear radius .",
    "there are no bound @xmath58-shell protons in @xmath1be and hence no node in the @xmath51-wave integrand .",
    "consequently the @xmath51-wave phase shift is small and attractive .",
    "the integrals corresponding to the integrands plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig-1p5 ] are given in table  [ table-3 ] .",
    "the largest change in the @xmath4-wave integral comes from the nuclear phase shift at large radii , as is evident when partial nuclear distortion is introduced .",
    "the additional distortion coming from the short - range nuclear potential produces a smaller but still significant change in the integral .",
    "this is common to the integrals evaluated at 0.5 and 1.5  mev . in the case of the @xmath51-wave integral ,",
    "the total effect of nuclear distortions is quite small , at most 2% , even at 1.5  mev .",
    "since the @xmath0 factor is sensitive to the phase shift the potential should reproduce the nuclear phase shifts . unfortunately , there are no experimental data for the scattering of protons from @xmath1be from which the phase shifts may be determined .",
    "however , data are available for the scattering in the mirror system , @xmath1li@xmath59 , for which we follow barker s analysis @xcite to determine the potential depths . from the elastic scattering of thermal neutrons from @xmath1li ,",
    "the scattering lengths are @xmath60  fm and @xmath61  fm @xcite , where @xmath62 is the scattering length for the channel spin @xmath0 .",
    "the depths of the potentials are adjusted to fit these scattering lengths , giving @xmath63 mev and @xmath64 mev for the @xmath65 and 2 potentials , respectively .",
    "the @xmath65 potential depth is very similar to the one we have used for the first woods - saxon potential model but the @xmath66 potential is significantly stronger .",
    "these nuclear potentials are then used in the calculation of the @xmath0 factor for @xmath1be(@xmath7 ) .",
    "this assumes isospin symmetry for the nuclear mean field .",
    "the contributions for the two channel spins are combined using barker s spectroscopic factors @xcite .",
    "we refer to this potential model as b2 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig-1p5 ] , we see that the @xmath4-wave nuclear distortion is dominated by the node in the scattering state wave function .",
    "this suggests that we may construct a simple model , the hard sphere model discussed in the introduction , where the initial state wave function is zero inside some radius , @xmath67 , and a pure coulomb wave outside .",
    "we impose the boundary condition that the wave function be zero at @xmath67 .",
    "this generates a phase shift and is equivalent to having an infinitely repulsive potential with a radius @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath51-wave scattering state is taken to be an undistorted coulomb wave function .",
    "the bound state is assumed to be a pure coulomb state , described by a whittaker function , for all radii .",
    "we saw for the potential model that it was necessary to have different potential depths for different channel spins .",
    "for the hard - sphere model this would suggest that we use different cut - off radii for different channel spins .",
    "however the simple model does not justify such elaborations and we find that with just a single , suitably chosen , radius we can reproduce the low energy results from a given potential model .",
    "the use of a single radius does , however , weaken the connection between the hard - sphere radius and the elastic scattering phase shift .",
    "we make the connection only through the intermediary of the potential model .",
    "the @xmath0 factors from the hard - sphere model are compared to the @xmath0 factor of other one - body models in fig .",
    "[ fig - two ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig - two](a ) , the solid curve is the result of the hard sphere model , with @xmath68  fm while the dashed curve displays the result of the woods - saxon potential , b1 .",

    "there is remarkable agreement between the two results up to 1.5  mev suggesting that the hard sphere model encapsulates the physics of the woods - saxon potential model . in fig .",
    "[ fig - two](b ) we show the results of a hard sphere model calculation with radius , @xmath70  fm , the calculation with the b2 potential , and barker s @xmath17-matrix calculation with @xmath71  fm @xcite .",
    "that choice of @xmath72 is predicated on the result that , in the @xmath17-matrix formalism , the matching radius should be roughly the sum of the radius and diffuseness of the potential @xcite .",
    "the level of agreement is again quite good .",
    "one advantage of the hard sphere model is that it is possible to do an explicit taylor series expansion about @xmath73  mev and obtain directly the derivatives of @xmath0 at threshold .",
    "following williams and koonin@xcite we employ the bessel function expansion@xcite of the coulomb wave functions to generate the taylor series expansion .",

    "the rational approximation , eqs .",
    "( [ eq - padez ] ) or ( [ eq - pade ] ) , is very similar to a pad approximant .",
    "the pad approximant is a ratio of polynomials with all the parameters determined by fitting the derivatives at the expansion point .",

    "the coefficients in the rational approximation , eq .  ( [ eq - padez ] ) , are growing much more slowly than in the taylor series expansion , eq .",

    "this approximation is valid to better than 1% up to 400  kev . by comparison , the taylor - series expansion and the logarithmic derivative expansion break down below 100  kev as expected given the radius of convergence .",

    "( [ eq - pade ] ) are given in table  [ table - padeb ] for a variety of models .",
    "in the case of the hard sphere models , the pole and constant term are the same to within 0.5% while the linear term varies by a factor of almost six .",
    "this confirms that the constant and pole term are coupled in an almost model independent manner while the linear term is strongly dependent on initial - state nuclear distortions .",
    "the first and second logarithmic derivatives are also given in table  [ table - padeb ] for comparison with the results of williams and koonin@xcite .",

    "the derivatives from two such fits are shown in the last two rows of table  [ table - padeb ] .",

    "we can , however , qualitatively reproduce the numbers of barker and adelberger _ et al . _ for the derivatives from our models if we use their fit regions .",

    "the effect is much more dramatic for the @xmath51-waves ; the contribution from three of the @xmath51-wave channels goes to zero @xcite at approximately 1.5  mev .",
    "that behavior is inconsistent with the very small effects of nuclear distortion in the @xmath51-wave component observed in the one - body models .    outside the range of the nuclear force the wave functions , and hence the matrix element , are determined by the properties of the coulomb force , the asymptotic strength , and the phase shift .",
    "as the two calculations of cst have the same phase shift @xcite the only difference must be at short distances , less than @xmath100  fm . at 1.5  mev , the integrand peaks at 14.5  fm , as determined by the coulomb properties and the phase shift . therefore the antisymmetrization , being the only difference between the two- and eight - body models , must make the integrand very large at small radii . that is possible",
    "if there is a resonance and , in that case , the whole @xmath51-wave contribution may indeed vanish .",
    "this may be simulated in the woods - saxon model by increasing the depth of the potential .",
    "however , a resonance would have a very pronounced effect on the phase shift , and there is no indication of a resonance in the @xmath51-wave component .",
    "it is also inconsistent with the statement that the two calculations of cst have the same phase shift .",
    "we note that in the potential models antisymmetrization is not a problem .",
    "one can construct a fully anti - symmetric eight - body wave function for the @xmath1be @xmath101 system by taking a slater determinant of the bound states wave functions and the scattering wave function .",
    "orthogonality is assured between the wave functions when they are calculated with the same potential , and the slater determinant is trivially constructed . as the transition operator is one - body in our model only the incoming proton",
    "is involved in the interaction with the mean field defined by the @xmath1be nucleus as a whole .",
    "antisymmetrization then becomes a problem only when one ventures beyond the potential model and has wave functions that are not orthogonal by construction .",
    "the discussions in the previous sections have concentrated on theoretical aspects of the low energy behavior of @xmath0 factor .",
    "we now turn to the data to determine the normalization and a meaningful value of the @xmath0 factor at astrophysical energies . when discussing the @xmath1be(@xmath7)@xmath8b @xmath0-factor data , it is important to consider resonant capture . the main resonance in the reaction at low energies is the @xmath102 resonance at 0.637  mev for the capture to the 0.774  mev state in @xmath8b @xcite .",
    "there is another , much weaker and wider , resonance in the cross section at 2.183  mev corresponding to the 2.32  mev state in @xmath8b @xcite .",
    "we limit our comparisons to @xmath103  mev , to avoid the influence of this wider state , and assume the resonance at 0.637  mev to be of breit - wigner form .",
    "there have been seven measurements of the @xmath1be(@xmath7)@xmath8b @xmath0 factor .",
    "two of these@xcite have large error bars and points at only a limited number of energies , two and one respectively .",
    "this limits their usefulness and we will not consider them further .",
    "the remaining five measurements fall into two basic classes .",
    "the first is comprised of the data of kavanagh _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and of parker @xcite .",
    "those data are on average @xmath104% greater in magnitude than the data of filippone _ et al . _",

    "the areal density of the @xmath1be target is frequently determined by measuring the @xmath1li(@xmath105 ) cross section , @xmath106 , and normalizing the data to the known value .",
    "we follow the recommendation of @xcite and take @xmath107  mb for all the data sets .",

    "some of the errors are common between different data sets : for example the value of @xmath106 used in the normalization .",

    "this disagreement with the data must be understood before using this model to extrapolate the data to threshold .    in table",
    "[ table - chi ] we show the @xmath116 per degree of freedom for individual data sets for four different models .",

    "@xcite we fit only the 1996 data .",
    "the higher value of @xmath116 per degree of freedom for the data of kavanagh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is due to three points on the lower side of the resonance peak ; the fitting ignores any relative error in the energy calibration . for the other three data sets the @xmath116 per degree of freedom is of order one except for the c8b results for which it is consistently higher .",
    "this reflects the incorrect energy dependence of the c8b model noted in the previous paragraph .",
    "we may now discuss in more detail fig .",
    "[ fig - fits ] , where two extreme fits to the non - resonant part of the data are shown .",
    "the first is the naive straight - line fit while the other is the hard sphere model result with @xmath117  fm .",
    "these two results are compared to the db gcm calculation in fig  [ fig - csoto - sc ] .",
    "the resonant contribution has been removed from all the curves .",
    "all three results are in reasonable agreement with each other in most of the energy region where data exists , @xmath118  mev ; hence the equally good fits .",
    "however , only the db calculation contains the correct physics at low energy .",
    "the straight line fit does not contain any contribution from the pole term and hence no upturn , while the upturn in the @xmath119  fm hard sphere model calculation is far too severe .",
    "also , the curvature in that hard sphere model result is not seen in the gcm model calculations in the region of the data .",
    "we can improve on the straight line fit by replacing the constant term with @xmath120 from the rational approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq - pade ] ) . since the ratio of the pole to constant term is fixed in an almost model independent manner and the pole term , by itself , is poorly determined by the data it make little sense to fit these two terms separately .",
    "this leads to the form @xmath121 \\label{eq - pade - f}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath122 are fit parameters and @xmath74 is in mev . using this form and a breit - wigner resonance we fit the data up to 1.5  mev .",
    "the resulting fit [ @xmath123  evb and @xmath124  mev@xmath83 ] is as good as that with the straight line but the value of @xmath112 is now @xmath126  evb .",
    "this is in agreement with the db results when fit over the same energy range .",
    "the parameter @xmath122 , determined by the fit , is also close to that obtained from the b2 potential model and corresponds to a low value of @xmath67 ( see table  [ table - padeb ] ) .",
    "we have explored the energy dependence of the @xmath1be(@xmath7)@xmath8b reaction and have constructed a simple model to illustrate the dominant physics . for energies , @xmath127  mev , the @xmath0 factor is dominated by a pole arising from the influence of the sub - threshold @xmath8b ground state .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0 factor near threshold is determined by three parameters : the location and residue of the pole , and by the effective hard sphere radius .",
    "the location of the pole is set by the binding energy of the valence proton in @xmath8b , while the residue is proportional to the normalization of the @xmath0 factor .",
    "the hard sphere radius simulates the effect of the nuclear distortion , and changes the slope of the @xmath0 factor .",
    "the low energy behavior of the models considered in this paper can be reproduced with @xmath67 in the range 0 to 3  fm .",
    "if we restrict the comparison to models that fit the elastic scattering of neutrons from @xmath1li a value of 1  fm is preferred .",
    "the @xmath0-factor data do not distinguish between the results obtained with these values . while some models at low energy are consistent with a hard sphere model of @xmath98  fm , suggesting no nuclear distortion at threshold , this is not of major concern : the preferred value of 1  fm is suitably well inside the nucleus so that the influence of nuclear distortion for what is , in effect , a surface capture is minimal .",
    "the range of @xmath67 from 0 to 3  fm introduces an error of about 5% in the extrapolations even when only the data below 400  kev is used .",
    "restricting ourselves to models consistent with the elastic neutron @xmath1li scattering data reduces this uncertainty to about 1% .",
    "thus from fitting the energy range of 0 to 400  kev we have @xmath128  evb , or equivalently @xmath129  evb , where the first error is experimental and the second is from model dependences in the fit .",
    "as the energy increases beyond 400  kev the model dependencies and , hence , uncertainties also increase . yet even at the somewhat higher energy region @xmath130  mev the simple model gives indications of how large the model effects might be .",
    "for example , the effects of nuclear distortion in the @xmath51-wave component of the @xmath0 factor is at most 2% even for @xmath131  mev , as the scattering wave barely penetrates into the region where the nuclear forces are strong .",
    "together with the comparison with existing data , this casts doubt on the eight - body model result of cst .    of the models considered here the db and c2b gcm calculations have the least variation of the extracted @xmath112 with the energy range fit , suggesting",
    "they do have a more accurate description of the physics in the higher energy range .",
    "however the gcm calculations predict the magnitude of @xmath112 to be much higher than that we extract from the recent experimental data . as with the fit to the lower energy range",
    "we restrict ourselves to models that are consistent with the neutron @xmath1li elastic scattering data .",
    "elastic @xmath101-@xmath1be scattering data would be useful in confirming the conclusions drawn from the elastic @xmath59-@xmath1li scattering data .",
    "neither data nor theoretical considerations are sufficiently refined to completely rule out the woods - saxon models .",
    "the value of @xmath112 differs by 5% depending on whether the gcm or the woods - saxon model is used for the extrapolation . taking this as an indication of the error for the fit in the energy range @xmath132  mev",
    "we then obtain @xmath133  evb and @xmath134  evb .",
    "the second error comes from the uncertainty ( half the spread ) in the choice of model used in the extrapolation .",
    "as the theoretical error here is not well understood we prefer the values of the @xmath0 factor extracted from the more restricted energy range .",
    "phase shift information from proton @xmath1be scattering in the 1  mev region would reduce the theoretical uncertainty from the fit over the larger energy range .",
