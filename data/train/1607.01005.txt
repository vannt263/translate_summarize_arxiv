    "in  @xcite we introduced the cosmicfish code as a powerful tool to perform forecast on many different models with future cosmological experiments . + in this set of notes",
    "we show the validation pipeline that was used for the code .",
    "we compared the results obtained with the cosmicfish code to other results in literature .",
    "we find an overall good level of agreement . + together with these notes we release a cosmicfish package that contains the relevant code to produce all the results presented here .",
    "this package is going to be updated as new validation results become available .",
    "the cosmicfish code and its validation package are publicly available at  http://cosmicfish.github.io .",
    "the validation package contains forecasted results for the _ planck _ mission , obtained using _ planck _",
    "blue book specifications  @xcite , and for the proposed cmbpol satellite  @xcite .",
    "+ cosmicfish is used varying the standard 6 parameters ( @xmath0 ) , from now on dubbed as s6 , and the number of relativistic species @xmath1 .",
    "+ the results are compared with what is obtained in section iii.c of  @xcite ; even though these results were obtained with mcmc methods , cosmicfish bounds and degeneracies show a very good agreement ( see figure  [ fig : cmbfor ] and table  [ tab : cmbfor ] ) .",
