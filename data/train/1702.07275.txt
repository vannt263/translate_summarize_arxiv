    "<S> the @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomalies , recently observed by the lhcb collaboration in @xmath2 transitions , may indicate the existence of a new @xmath3 boson , which may arise from gauged @xmath4 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> flavor - changing neutral current @xmath3 couplings , such as @xmath5 , can be induced by the presence of extra vector - like quarks . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the lhc signatures of the induced right - handed @xmath5 coupling that is inspired by , but not directly linked to , the @xmath2 anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> the specific processes studied are @xmath6 and its conjugate process each followed by @xmath7 . by constructing an effective theory for the @xmath5 coupling , </S>",
    "<S> we first explore model - independently the discovery potential of such a @xmath3 at the 14 tev lhc with 300 and 3000 fb@xmath8 integrated luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we then reinterpret the model - independent results within the gauged @xmath4 model . in connection with @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , the model also implies the existence of a flavor - conserving @xmath9 coupling , which can drive the @xmath10 process . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that existing lhc results for dimuon resonance searches already constrain the @xmath9 coupling , and that the @xmath3 can be discovered in either or both of the @xmath6 and @xmath11 processes . </S>",
    "<S> we further discuss the sensitivity to the left - handed @xmath5 coupling and find that the coupling values favored by the @xmath2 anomalies lie slightly below the lhc discovery reach even with 3000 fb@xmath8 . </S>"
