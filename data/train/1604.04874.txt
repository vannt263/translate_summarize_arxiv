    "an established framework in queueing theory is to identify scaling limits of system dynamics , whereby one can describe the qualitative behaviour of processes such as queue length , workload and other performance measures . in this context , the classical skorokhod map ( sm ) introduced by skorokhod @xcite and its multi - dimensional analogs , have served as useful tools for establishing limit theorems . the classical skorokhod map , which in this paper we refer to as the sm on the half - line , acts on real - valued paths to produce a path that is constrained to be non - negative . by representing the queue - length process as the image , under a ( possibly multi - dimensional ) sm , of a simpler so - called `` netput '' process",
    ", one can often reduce the problem of establishing convergence of the sequence of queue - length processes to the simpler problem of establishing convergence of the corresponding sequence of netput processes . in recent years , the study of more complex networks has led to the use of measure - valued processes , which have proved powerful for analyzing both single - server and many - server systems , and specifically , establishing law of large numbers ( lln ) and central limit theorem ( clt ) results @xcite . in the context of single - server networks ,",
    "measure - valued processes have been particularly useful for studying scaling limits of models in which jobs are prioritized according to a continuous parameter , such as the deadline of the job or the job size . in this case , the measures for which the dynamics are specified correspond to the ( suitably normalized ) counting measure that keeps track of the number of jobs with deadlines and sizes , respectively , in any given interval . in this work ,",
    "we introduce a map acting on a subset of paths in the space of signed measures that can be viewed as a measure - valued analog of the classical sm , and which we refer to as the measure - valued skorokhod map ( mvsm ) .",
    "we show that the provides a unified framework for the study of the dynamics of queueing systems with continuous parameter priority scheduling policies .",
    "specifically , we use the map to formulate fluid models of several such queueing systems , as well as to prove lln results for these systems , both in time - homogeneous and time - varying settings .",
    "the map and its regularity properties may be of independent interest and could potentially also have applications in other fields .    to describe the mvsm , let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the spaces of finite non - negative measures and signed measures , respectively , on the non - negative real line .",
    "given @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an @xmath4-valued cdlg path and @xmath8 is a non - negative non - decreasing cdlg real - valued function on @xmath1 , the maps the @xmath5-valued path @xmath9 to an @xmath4-valued cdlg path in such a way that for each @xmath10 , the real - valued path @xmath11 - \\mu(t)$ ] is transformed under the classical sm on the half - line and the constraining terms for different @xmath12 are coupled in a specific fashion ( see definition [ defi-1 ] for a precise description ) .",
    "our key observation is that the serves as a generic model for priority .",
    "we demonstrate this point by applying the to study several queueing models employing a continuous parameter priority that have been previously treated by distinct tools , and to obtain new results for models that seem to fall outside the purview of existing methods .    among the several scheduling policies for which we argue that the is applicable , we treat three in detail : earliest - deadline - first ( edf ) , shortest - remaining - processing - time ( srpt ) and shortest - job - first ( sjf ) . in edf",
    ", jobs are prioritized according to their deadlines , which are declared upon arrival .",
    "we consider two versions of the policy , depending on whether the jobs are subject to `` soft '' or `` hard '' deadlines . if jobs continue to be served even after their deadlines have elapsed",
    ", then we refer to this as the `` soft edf '' policy , whereas with the `` hard edf '' policy , jobs that miss their deadlines either renege or are ejected from the system .",
    "the soft or hard edf policy is said to be preemptive if an arriving job with a more urgent deadline is allowed to interrupt a job in service , and non - preemptive otherwise . in the srpt and sjf policies",
    ", scheduling is prioritized according to the size of a job ( for a survey and motivation regarding these policies we refer to the introduction in @xcite ) . under srpt ,",
    "the arrival of a job whose size is smaller than the remaining service time of the one being currently processed will interrupt the service , whereas service is non - interruptible under sjf .",
    "in other words , srpt and sjf are , respectively , preemptive and non - preemptive versions of a common priority policy .",
    "to set our results in context , we first discuss prior work on the edf , srpt and sjf models .",
    "the edf model was first considered in @xcite as far as scaling limits are concerned , and further results appeared in @xcite . in both papers diffusion approximations in heavy traffic were established ; @xcite treats the preemptive soft edf model with general renewal arrivals and independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) service times ( the so - called @xmath13 setting ) , whereas @xcite analyzes the preemptive hard edf ( or @xmath14 ) version of the model , with both works considering jobs that have i.i.d .",
    "deadlines drawn from a general distribution . the analysis in @xcite",
    "is carried out by introducing a map ( see section 4.1.1 therein ) that transforms the space of cdlg @xmath4-valued paths to itself in such a way that it acts on the measure - valued state process of the preemptive soft edf model to obtain an approximation of the corresponding state process in the preemptive hard edf model , which becomes exact in the heavy - traffic limit .",
    "as elaborated in @xcite , this map can be viewed as a measure - valued generalization of the map on real - valued paths that takes the image of the sm on the half - line to the image of the so - called double - barrier sm on a bounded interval @xmath15 $ ] @xcite , and thus , is completely different from our mvsm . in terms of lln limits ,",
    "the non - preemptive hard edf model was studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former considered general deadline distributions but poisson arrivals and exponential service times ( the @xmath16 setting ) by analyzing the markov evolution of a measure - valued state process , whereas the latter considered the case of general arrivals and service times with general deadline distributions ( the @xmath17 setting ) that satisfy a certain monotonicity condition , and made key use of a certain skorokhod problem with a time - varying barrier .",
    "all the existing lln and clt results for the ( soft or hard ) edf policy mentioned above @xcite heavily rely on the assumption that the arrival and service rates are constant , and more specifically , crucially use the so - called _ frontier _ process , a concept that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the frontier at time @xmath18 is defined to be the maximum of the _ lead times _ of jobs present in the system at time @xmath18 that have ever been in service ( here , the lead time of a job is defined to be its deadline minus the current time ) .",
    "the results crucially rely on the fact that under suitable conditions , the asymptotic behavior is such that the frontier process separates the population of jobs into those that have been sent to service and those that have not .",
    "however , such a frontier process may not exist in general .",
    "in particular , as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] and supported by computer simulations , there is typically no such separation of populations when the arrival or service rate is time varying .    as for results on scaling limits of the srpt and sjf policies , clts for queues in heavy traffic working under the srpt policy",
    "have been established in @xcite , while lln results for the srpt and sjf policies have been established in @xcite and @xcite . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the limits under both policies agree . as in the prior work on edf",
    ", the works @xcite and @xcite also make use of an analogously defined frontier process , and assume constant arrival and service rates .    in this paper",
    "we apply the common framework of the mvsm to establish lln results for the edf , srpt and sjf policies , in particular allowing for time - inhomogeneous arrival and service rates .",
    "specifically , we establish the lln limit of a queue operating under the non - preemptive hard edf policy , in which jobs with i.i.d .",
    "deadlines from a general distribution arrive to a single - server queue and the cumulative arrival and service processes are modelled by general , possibly time - inhomogeneous non - decreasing stochastic processes ( the @xmath19 setting ) .",
    "the result we obtain is far more general than @xcite and @xcite as it allows variable arrival and service rates and also relaxes the assumption made in @xcite regarding strict monotonicity of the deadline distribution function .",
    "moreover , the treatment of the fluid model equations establishes a result that may be of independent interest , which shows that edf scheduling is optimal at the lln scale in terms of the reneging count .",
    "earlier results on this aspect include @xcite , where the optimality of edf , in terms of minimizing the total number of reneged jobs , is shown for the @xmath20 queue . in @xcite it is shown that the total amount of _ reneged work _ is optimized in a @xmath21 queue when the edf scheduling policy is applied .",
    "optimality properties of edf are also studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , our optimality result extends these results to quite a broad setting . for the sjf and srpt policies ,",
    "we generalize the results in @xcite to allow time - varying arrival and service rates , where again , the notion of a frontier becomes ineffective .",
    "also , our proof technique , which involves the application of the in conjunction with the continuous mapping theorem , substantially simplifies the analysis .",
    "although we consider the performance of priority policies at a single queue in this paper , we believe that a suitable extension of the mvsm approach could also be useful for the study of networks .",
    "past results regarding the soft edf policy in a network context are as follows .",
    "queueing networks with random routing under the soft edf policy without preemption were studied in @xcite ( referred to there as earliest - due - date - first - served ) , where it was shown that subcritical networks are stable by analyzing the associated fluid model .",
    "this result was extended in @xcite to the case of preemptive subcritical edf networks when customer routes are fixed by studying the fluid model and showing that it satisfies the fifo ( first - in - first - out ) fluid model equations .",
    "this work also established a stability theorem for a broader class of ( not necessary subcritical ) networks with reneging , but without recourse to fluid model equations .",
    "the main idea in @xcite is to show that the initial lead time distribution vanishes in the limit , and thus edf reduces to fifo .",
    "with a view to extending the general theory of heavy - traffic limits for multiclass queueing networks to a class of non - head - of - the - line scheduling policies , the paper @xcite also studies fluid limits of edf networks and characterizes its invariant states",
    ". the mvsm approach could potentially be useful for obtaining results for srpt and sjf networks , where there are not many existing results .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a completely different extension of the classical sm that acts on measure - valued paths ( or more general real - valued functions defined on a poset ) was considered in @xcite .",
    "however , while interesting on its own , when applied to our setting this extension provides a decomposition that is not useful for the applications considered here ( see remark [ rem - anakon ] ) .    to summarize our main contributions in this paper ,",
    "we have    * introduced and established regularity properties of a skorokhod - type map , the mvsm , that acts on a space of measure - valued paths ; * shown that this map serves as a natural tool for analyzing priority queueing models with continuous parameter , and used the map to formulate fluid models for ( both hard and soft ) edf , sjf and srpt ; * developed a unified method for establishing lln limits for the aforementioned policies , including in time - inhomogeneous situations in which the notion of a frontier , which was used in previous analyses , is ineffective .",
    "in addition to the time - inhomogeneous case being of intrinsic interest since it is often the generic situation in applications , another motivation for our analysis is that the is likely to also be pertinent for the study of ( even time - homogeneous ) many - server systems with general service and deadline distributions operating under the edf , srpt or sjf policies .",
    "moreover , we believe that this approach , and in particular the mvsm , will also be useful for the analysis of other queueing models in which there is prioritization with respect to a continuous parameter ( such as , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". furthermore , the mvsm , or its close relative , may potentially also be useful for the study of interacting particle systems arising in other fields .",
    "such applications will be explored in future work .",

    "<S> the skorokhod map on the half - line has proved to be a useful tool for studying processes with non - negativity constraints . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a measure - valued analog of this map that transforms each element @xmath0 of a certain class of cdlg paths that take values in the space of signed measures on @xmath1 to a cdlg path that takes values in the space of non - negative measures on @xmath1 in such a way that for each @xmath2 , the path @xmath3 $ ] is transformed via a skorokhod map on the half - line , and the regulating functions for different @xmath2 are coupled . </S>",
    "<S> we establish regularity properties of this map and show that the map provides a convenient tool for studying queueing systems in which tasks are prioritized according to a continuous parameter . </S>",
    "<S> three such well known models are the _ earliest - deadline - first _ , the _ shortest - job - first _ and the _ shortest - remaining - processing - time _ scheduling policies . for these applications , </S>",
    "<S> we show how the map provides a unified framework within which to form fluid model equations , prove uniqueness of solutions to these equations and establish convergence of scaled state processes to the fluid model . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> for these models , we obtain new convergence results in time - inhomogeneous settings , which appear to fall outside the purview of existing approaches .    </S>",
