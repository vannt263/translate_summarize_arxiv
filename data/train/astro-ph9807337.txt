    "mn hya ( rx j0929.12404 ) was discovered during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey and subsequently found to be an polar ( or am her ) type of cataclysmic variable ( sekiguchi , nakada & bassett 1994 and buckley et al 1998a ) .",
    "polars are interacting binary stars in which the white dwarf primary has a magnetic field strength sufficiently high to synchronise its spin period with the binary orbital period .",
    "further , the magnetic field prevents the formation of an accretion disc and the accretion stream impacts directly onto the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "mn hya is one of 9 currently known eclipsing am her systems .",
    "these are particularly important systems to study since parameters such as the masses of the component stars can , in principle , be accurately determined",
    ". of these systems , three ( including mn hya at @xmath3=3.39 hrs ) are above the upper edge of the ` period gap ' ( @xmath123 hrs ) .",
    "mn hya also shows two ` dips ' in soft x - rays where the accretion stream obscures emission from the hot post shock region above the white dwarf ( buckley et al 1998b ) .",
    "the deepest dip occurs at @xmath00.9 ( just before the eclipse of the white dwarf by the secondary star ) , while another less deep dip occurs at @xmath00.5 .",
    "these dips are not seen in the optical continuum ( sekiguchi , nakada & bassett 1994 ) .",
    "we have obtained low - medium resolution phase resolved optical spectroscopy of mn hya and determined the spectral type of the secondary star , its distance , the magnetic field strength of white dwarf and examine how the optical spectrum varies through the absorption dips .",
    "spectra were obtained using the eso 3.6 m telescope at la silla , chile on 1997 feb 7/8 & 8/9 .",
    "the conditions were photometric and the seeing was between 1.01.5@xmath4 . on the first night alternate images ( with exposures typically 300 sec ) were taken with the r300 ( 60009800  ) and b300 ( 38006800  ) grisms . with",
    "a slit of 1.5@xmath4 the resolution in both grisms was @xmath115 .",
    "on the second night , only the b300 grism was used and the exposures were 180 sec .",
    "wavelength calibration of the flat - fielded and bias - subtracted two - dimensional images was performed using a he - ar arc spectra taken at the start and end of the night ( flexure is negligible on eso 3.6 m telescope ) . the wavelength calibrated spectra were flux calibrated using the standard stars gd 108 and feige 67 .",
    "one method of determining the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf is from the spacing of cyclotron harmonics . for the field strengths seen in polars ( @xmath510200 mg ) cyclotron harmonics",
    "are seen as broad humps in optical / ir spectra .",
    "the cyclotron flux originates from electrons spiraling around the field lines in the post - shock region above the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "these humps vary in their intensity and ( to a lesser degree their wavelength ) as a function of our viewing angle to the post - shock region ( ie they vary over the orbital phase ) .",
    "there was no obvious sign of cyclotron features in our optical spectra . to make a more detailed search for such features we made a mean ` blue ' and ` red ' spectrum :",
    "the mean blue spectrum was made up of ` blue ' spectra ( 38006800  ) taken on the second night , while the mean red spectrum was made up of ` red ' spectra ( 60009800  ) taken on the first night ( on the second night no red spectra were obtained ) .",
    "we then averaged spectra to give spectra covering the phase range @xmath6=0.050.15 , 0.150.25 etc and then normalised these spectra by dividing by the appropriate mean spectrum ( we use the ephemeris of buckley et al 1998a which defines @xmath6=0.0 as the center of the eclipse of the white dwarf by the secondary ) .",
    "figure [ cychumps ] shows these normalised spectra over the binary orbit .",
    "there is no evidence for cyclotron features until the phase interval covering @xmath6=0.350.45 when humps are seen at @xmath1 5800 & 7200 .",
    "these continue to be seen until @xmath00.7 .",
    "this is confirmed if we divide the spectrum covering @xmath6=0.350.45 by the spectrum covering @xmath6=0.050.15 .",
    "( 8,22 ) ( -6,-2 . )    to determine the wavelength of cyclotron harmonics for a given magnetic field strength @xmath7 , we write @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the fundamental cyclotron frequency ) as @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 g ) .",
    "we then use equation ( 3 ) of cropper et al ( 1988 ) and put it in terms of @xmath12 :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is in units of kev , @xmath16 is the cyclotron harmonic number and @xmath17 is the viewing angle to the magnetic field angle .",
    "we can now rearrange the above as a function of @xmath12 :    @xmath18    where @xmath12 is in  .    to determine the magnetic field strength we searched a range of parameters which gave consecutive harmonics placed at @xmath1 5800 & 7200 . for lower values of @xmath17",
    "the harmonics are blue shifted by a small amount compared to higher values . for low magnetic fields ( @xmath515 mg ) the individual harmonics become indistinguishable and form a continuum . similarly for temperatures @xmath1915kev individual harmonics are not visible . by comparing the expected wavelength of the harmonics by eye to the observed spectrum , we found that @xmath7=42 mg , @xmath20=9kev and @xmath17=90@xmath21 gave the best ` fit ' . assuming that we have correctly identified harmonics at @xmath1 5800 & 7200",
    ", we estimate the error on @xmath7 to be @xmath112 mg based on our search of the variable parameters .",
    "the value of @xmath7=42 mg found here compares with @xmath520 mg estimated by buckley et al ( 1998a ) from a single spectrum of exposure 3000 sec .",
    "their spectrum was not flux - calibrated and they caution that the small - scale variations seen in their spectrum could have been due to other factors rather than cyclotron humps .",
    "we therefore consider that our estimate of @xmath7=42 mg to be more reliable .",
    "we will examine this in more detail in  [ daveb ] .",
    "we obtained a red spectrum of mn hya which was centred on the eclipse ( figure [ eclipse ] ) .",
    "although emission lines are visible , this may be due to some pre or post eclipse flux being recorded .",
    "absorption features due to the secondary star are visible at 7150  and 8450  .",
    "however , the low resolution of the spectrum did not permit a detailed analysis of these features .",
    "no secondary features are visible outwith the eclipse .    to determine the spectral type of the secondary star we compared its spectrum taken during the eclipse with late type spectra kindly supplied by dr robert c smith .",
    "these are overlaid in figure [ eclipse ] .",
    "the depth of the tio band at 8450  indicates that it is later than m1 , while the lack of a prominent na i feature at 81838194 suggests that it is earlier than @xmath1m6 .",
    "bearing in mind that some flux has been recorded which is not due to the secondary ( since we observe emission lines ) , the overall spectral shape is closest to m3.5 .    using the empirical mass - radius relationship of patterson ( 1984 )",
    ", the mass of the secondary is expected to be 0.31 @xmath22 for an orbital period of @xmath3=3.39 hrs . using the tables of spectral type against stellar mass in zombeck ( 1990 )",
    ", we find a spectral type of @xmath1m3 . within the uncertainties involved",
    "this is consistent with the spectral type determined from the eclipse spectrum .    using the photometry of sekiguchi , nakada & bassett ( 1994 ) , where they find @xmath23=18.5 at mid - eclipse , and the absolute magnitude of an m3 v star ( @xmath24=8.71 : bessell 1991 ) ,",
    "we obtain a distance of 910 pc if zero absorption is assumed .",
    "however , the x - ray data obtained using _ rosat _ show that the absorption to mn hya is @xmath25 @xmath26 ( buckley et al 1998b ) .",
    "this implies @xmath27=0.9 and a distance of 610 pc . for a m4 v star ( @xmath24=9.85 : bessell 1991 )",
    "we get distance of 360 and 540 pc assuming @xmath27=0.9 and @xmath27=0.0 respectively .",
    "we estimate that the distance to mn hya is between 300700pc .",
    "( 8,13 ) ( -1,-1 )",
    "in the previous sections we have concentrated on broad spectral features . here",
    "we examine individual line variations over the course of the orbital period .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature is the interval immediately before the eclipse ( @xmath00.90 ) which coincides with the most prominent dip seen in soft x - rays ( buckley et al 1998b ) .",
    "figure [ dip ] shows spectra starting at @xmath6=0.85 where the spectrum has strong balmer and he ii line emission and is typical of a polar .",
    "however , at @xmath6=0.87 the emission lines start to become less prominent , especially towards bluer wavelengths . at @xmath6=0.89",
    "only 5 emission lines are present ",
    "heii @xmath12 4100 , h@xmath28 , hei @xmath12 4388 , heii @xmath12 4686 , h@xmath29 and h@xmath2 .",
    "moving later in phase , at @xmath30 and 0.92 , we find that heii @xmath12 4686 is still in emission , while h@xmath2 and h@xmath29 appear in absorption _ and _ emission . at this phase",
    "the emission and absorbed components of the h@xmath2 line have red shifted radial velocities of @xmath1270 km s@xmath31 and @xmath1870 km s@xmath31 respectively .",
    "later in phase , at @xmath6=0.94 and 0.96 , very broad emission lines are seen shortwards of 5000  , although heii @xmath12 4686 is as narrow as before . in the spectrum taken immediately before eclipse ,",
    "hei @xmath12 5876 is back in absorption and all other lines apart from heii @xmath12 4686 are very weak .",
    "by @xmath00.05 , the narrow component of the lines has returned . in  6",
    "we discuss the interpretation of these dip spectra while in the next section we examine the line profile variations over the whole of the orbital period in more detail .",
    "( 8,10.5 ) ( -1.5,-2.5 )      we fitted the emission lines using a single gaussian profile for the helium lines and two gaussian profiles in the case of the hydrogen lines ( there were some spectra where an additional gaussian improved the fit to the he lines , but not in any consistent manner ) .",
    "the line - flux was determined by simply summing the flux under the gaussian(s ) .",
    "the line - flux variations of h@xmath2 , h@xmath29 , hei ( 5876 ) and heii ( 4686 ) are shown in the top panel of figure [ rvew ] .",
    "( we only show the results from the night of feb 8/9 since on the previous night the sampling was lower ) .",
    "the radial velocities and ew for the narrow and broad components of h@xmath2 , h@xmath29 , hei(5876 ) and heii(4686 ) are shown in figure [ rvew ] .",
    "the narrow and broad components were fitted with a sinusoidal function of the form :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 ) is the radial velocity at phase @xmath6 , @xmath34 is the component of the accretion streams velocity perpendicular to the orbital plane projected along the line of sight , @xmath35 is the velocity amplitude and @xmath36 is the phase at which the observed radial velocity equals the @xmath34 velocity when crossing from blue to red . to estimate the errors ,",
    "the velocity error was adjusted to normalise the reduced to 1.0 since it was not possible to derive meaningful errors to the gaussian fits .",
    "table [ rvparam ] shows the best fit parameters and the 90 per cent confidence interval while figure [ rvew ] shows the best fits along with the data .",
    "we now discuss the implications these results have on our view of the accretion stream .",
    ".the radial velocity parameters for the h@xmath2 and h@xmath29 lines fitted using two gaussian profiles .",
    "@xmath35 is the velocity amplitude and @xmath36 is the phase at which the observed radial velocity equals the @xmath34 velocity when crossing from blue to red .",

    "we have been able to distinguish two components in the hydrogen line profiles : a narrow and a broad component .",
    "the broad component is most probably due to emission originating from the accretion stream close to the white dwarf because of its high maximum radial velocity .",
    "since the stream initially has the rotational velocity of the secondary star , the broad component will be seen with maximum red shift before @xmath6=0.0  in this case at @xmath00.91 .",
    "the narrow component has a much lower radial velocity than the broad component : if the narrow component originated from the heated face of the secondary star we would expect to see it with maximum red shift at @xmath00.25 .",
    "the fact that we see it with maximum red shift at @xmath00.98 implies that the narrow component which we can distinguish is not a good marker of the secondary star . in non - eclipsing systems , where there is no extra information on the orbital phase of the secondary",
    ", it has often been assumed that the narrow component originates from the irradiated face of the secondary . in the case of mn hya",
    "we know that the maximum red - shift of the narrow component occurs close to the eclipse , so can not be emitted by the secondary .",
    "instead the accretion stream close to the secondary is the most likely candidate and this view is supported by the fact that the narrow component is eclipsed and with a duration longer than the white dwarf eclipse .",
    "we note that this may well be true for most / all systems , and that low - resolution spectroscopy is not a suitable method for detecting the motion of the secondary ( and thus measuring the mass ratio of the system ) .",
    "schwope , mantel & horne ( 1997 ) , for instance , show that with higher resolution spectroscopy , it is possible to separate the narrow components emitted by the stream and the secondary .",
    "there are a number of systems which show dips in soft x - rays which have been attributed to the accretion stream obscuring the hot post shock region above the white dwarf ( eg watson et al 1989 , buckley et al 1998b ) . however , there is only 1 other polar in which optical lines appear in absorption during a stream dip ( ef eri : verbunt et al 1980 , allen , ward & wright 1981 ) . in the case of ef eri , lines redder than 5500  appeared in absorption . in the case of mn hya",
    "we find that at @xmath00.90 the h@xmath2 and h@xmath29 lines are seen in both emission and absorption , both of which are red - shifted .",
    "the emission and absorption components of the h@xmath2 line have radial velocities of @xmath1270 km s@xmath31 and @xmath1870 km s@xmath31 respectively .",
    "since the stream is curved and we do not know where the emission and absorption components originate we can not determine the true velocities of these components .",
    "it is , however , likely that the absorption component originates closer to the white dwarf than the emission component . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact there are two accreting poles ( cf next section ) and hence two accretion streams once the stream attaches onto the magnetic field lines of the white dwarf , may complicate this interpretation .",
    "in  3 we presented phase resolved optical spectra of mn hya which show features which we interpret as cyclotron humps and estimate a magnetic field strength of the white dwarf to be @xmath7=42 mg from their spacing .",
    "this is higher than the @xmath520 mg estimated by buckley et al ( 1998a ) from an integrated non - flux calibrated spectrum .",
    "buckley et al then modeled their white light optical polarimetry using @xmath7=20 mg . to test",
    "if their same polarimetry data can be adequately modeled using a field strength of @xmath3742 mg and determine the location of the accretion regions on the surface of the white dwarf we measured the data points from fig .",
    "4 of buckley et al ( 1998a ) and fitted their data using the optimisation method of potter , hakala & cropper ( 1998 ) . up until now",
    "most polarimetry data , including that of buckley et al , have been modeled by constructing accretion regions on the surface of the white dwarf by hand and then a good fit to the data was achieved by trial and error .",
    "the method of potter , hakala & cropper finds the best fit in an objective manner . in our new fit",
    "we fixed the magnetic field strength at @xmath7=42 mg and the inclination at 75@xmath21 ( derived from the eclipse duration , buckley et al 1998a ) .",
    "the fits of buckley et al ( 1998a ) implied that two accretion regions are visible ( the main region being partially visible near the lower magnetic pole ) and that they are greatly extended in magnetic longitude ( the secondary region is 300@xmath21 in length and is near the upper pole ) . both accretion regions were offset from their respective magnetic poles by @xmath38 .",
    "our fits to the same polarimetric data are shown in figure [ steve ] .",
    "the fits to the intensity data ( white light ) and the circular polarimetry are good and better than the fit obtained by buckley et al ( 1998a ) .",
    "the level of linear polarisation is rather low and the peak in linear polarisation around the eclipse phase is almost certainly due to instrumental or sky background effects in the original data .",
    "the best fit to the data was obtained with the magnetic axis having a tilt of @xmath39 with respect to the spin axis of the white dwarf .",
    "further , our fit implies accretion regions which are less extended than found by buckley et al : the main region is extended by less than 60@xmath21 in magnetic longitude and is offset from the magnetic pole by 15@xmath21 and is visible on the limb of the white dwarf between @xmath40 .",
    "the secondary region ( which is much less bright than the primary region ) is roughly circular in shape and is visible between @xmath41 and comes almost face on at @xmath6=0.9 .",
    "the location of the primary accretion region is consistent with the detection of cyclotron humps in the optical spectra between @xmath42 .",
    "the fact that no cyclotron features are seen when the secondary accretion region is visible may simply be due to the features being too faint to detect or that the magnetic field at the secondary region is lower than the primary accretion region .",
    "buckley et al ( 1998b ) suggested that the latter may account for the higher soft to hard x - ray ratio over @xmath6=0.030.45 compared to @xmath6=0.450.87 .",
    "we conclude that our estimate of @xmath43 mg is consistent with the optical polarimetry and that at @xmath00.9 it is the secondary accretion region which is obscured by the accretion stream .",
