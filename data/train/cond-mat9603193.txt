    "many aspects of the behavior of polymers can be described by self - avoiding walks on a lattice .",
    "some polymers have interactions that depend on the spatial orientation of the polymer , for instance a - b polyester .",
    "such polymers are conveniently modeled by _ oriented _ self - avoiding walks ( osaw ) with two types of short - ranged interaction between edges depending on their relative orientation @xcite .",
    "the model of investigation in this paper consists of one osaw on a square lattice . besides self - avoidance ,",
    "the only interactions of the osaw with itself occur if two steps of the walk are one lattice spacing apart .",
    "if the two steps have the same orientation , they are said to form a _",
    "parallel contact _ , to which an energy gain of @xmath2 is attributed .",
    "if they have opposite orientation , they are said to form an _ anti - parallel contact _",
    ", with an energy gain of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 is the inverse temperature , and we define @xmath5 and @xmath6 , then the partition function of such an oriented self - avoiding walk is given by @xmath7 where the sum is over all allowed values of the number of parallel contacts , @xmath8 , and the number of anti - parallel contacts , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the number of configurations of length @xmath11 with @xmath8 parallel and @xmath9 anti - parallel contacts .",
    "the limiting reduced free energy per step is given by @xmath12\\;.\\ ] ]    the phase diagram of this model has been studied previously @xcite ; numerical results from exact series up to @xmath13 edges showed the existence of three phases : a free saw phase , a normal collapsed phase and a compact spiral phase .",
    "the transition from the free to the spiral phase was conjectured to be of first order .",
    "in this article we will concentrate on the case where there are only interactions between parallel contacts , i.e. @xmath14 . the earlier work @xcite rigorously proved that for this case the reduced limiting free energy is constant for @xmath15 with value @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the growth constant for saw @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    "the following rigorous bounds were proved : @xmath20 the above results prove the existence of a phase transition for @xmath21 .",
    "bennett - wood _ et al _ @xcite conjectured that the critical inverse temperature @xmath22 is near or equal the lower bound which , for @xmath23 , is @xmath24 . in section [ phasetrans ]",
    "we further investigate this phase transition by extending the exact enumeration data , by means of monte carlo results and combining them with some rigorous results on tight spirals .",
    "another interesting question concerning osaws is the mean number of contacts .",
    "one of us proved that the mean number of anti - parallel contacts @xmath25 in two or higher dimensions , where @xmath11 is the number of steps of the walk @xcite .",
    "the mean number of parallel contacts scales as @xmath26 in three or higher dimensions , but in two dimensions the behavior is still an open question .",
    "field theoretic work @xcite predicts that in two dimensions @xmath27 in the limit @xmath28 .",
    "however , monte carlo results for osaws with up to 3000 steps seem to indicate that @xmath29 tends to a constant @xmath30 @xcite . in section [ mp ]",
    "we present the results of large - scale monte carlo simulations with osaws of up to 5000 steps , and investigate these results in a way that allows extrapolations to even larger @xmath11 . based on these results we obtain an upper bound for @xmath29 in the limit @xmath28 .",
    "bennett - wood _ et al _ @xcite enumerated all configurations up to saws with a length of @xmath13 and ordered them according to their number of parallel and anti - parallel contacts .",
    "we extended the exact enumeration of the osaws with parallel contacts , and obtained all values for @xmath31 , the number of osaws consisting of @xmath11 steps and having @xmath8 parallel contacts , up to @xmath32 .    in our enumeration program ,",
    "we start with generating all osaws of length @xmath33 with a parallel contact between the first and the last step . for each walk",
    "@xmath34 , we determine the number of parallel contacts @xmath35 .",
    "we also determine @xmath36 , the number of extensions on the inside end of walk @xmath34 with length @xmath37 and @xmath38 parallel contacts with either itself or @xmath34 , and @xmath39 , the corresponding quantity for the extensions on the outside end .",
    "since the walk @xmath34 prevents contacts between the inside and outside extensions , the total number of osaws of length @xmath11 with @xmath8 parallel contacts is given by @xmath40 the prefactor in this equation corrects for the fact that there are @xmath8 different walks @xmath34 from which we can generate the same osaw with @xmath8 parallel contacts . exploiting rotational and mirror symmetry , we enumerated all osaws of length @xmath41 with one or more parallel contacts in a run of about two weeks on a four - processor dec alpha workstation .",
    "finally , the number of osaws without parallel contacts is obtained by subtraction from the total number of osaws ( from ref .",
    "the results are given in table [ enumtab ] , and plotted as the solid lines in figure [ exactenum ] , where @xmath42 is plotted as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the figure shows that up to @xmath32 , the number of configurations as a function of the number of parallel contacts first drops quickly with a factor @xmath43 , but then , over the whole range @xmath44 , falls off exponentially with the same exponent @xmath45 .",
    "the partition function @xmath46 is thus described well by @xmath47 where @xmath43 and @xmath45 are @xmath48dependent parameters .    to extend",
    "the graph presenting the partition function beyond @xmath32 by means of exact enumeration is very hard .",
    "however , the left part of this graph for much larger @xmath11 can be obtained statistically by means of monte carlo simulations : osaws are randomly generated with the pivot algorithm @xcite , and a histogram is made of the number of parallel contacts of these osaws .",
    "this gives us a direct measurement of @xmath49 for a small number of parallel contacts . in our monte carlo simulations",
    ", we thermalized over @xmath50 pivot moves , followed by @xmath51 moves to gather statistics ; statistical errors were obtained by repeating the whole procedure 10 times .",
    "the results are shown in table [ pntable ] ; the density of osaws with more than @xmath52 parallel contacts is so small that they will most likely never be generated , and we only obtain an upper bound for them .",
    "a good approximation for @xmath53 is known : @xmath54 where @xmath1 , @xmath55 @xcite , and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the factor of a fourth is due to the fact that we count osaws that are equivalent after rotation only once .",
    "the monte carlo results from table [ pntable ] for @xmath57 and 100 , multiplied by @xmath53 , are plotted as circles in the left side of figure [ exactenum ] .",
    "also the utmost right point of the graph can be obtained , as there the only relevant configurations are tight spirals .",
    "the corners of a tight spiral are reached after @xmath58 steps , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath59 or @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of steps in the same direction at the inner end of the tight spiral , and @xmath62 is a positive integer . each additional step of the tight spiral adds one parallel contact , except steps before and after a corner .",
    "thus , the number of parallel contacts @xmath63 for an osaw of length @xmath11 is given by @xmath64                    -\\left[\\sqrt{n+\\frac { k    ^2}{4}-1}-\\frac { k    } { 2}\\right]\\\\ \\label{tighteq } & &                 -\\left[\\sqrt{n+\\frac{(k-1)^2}{4 }   } -\\frac{(k-1)}{2}\\right ]                    -\\left[\\sqrt{n+\\frac{(k-1)^2}{4}-1}-\\frac{(k-1)}{2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where square brackets denote the entier function ( @xmath65 $ ] is the largest integer not larger than @xmath66 ) .",
    "the number of parallel contacts of a ` rectangular ' tight spiral ( with @xmath67 ) does never exceed that of the ` square ' tight spiral ( with @xmath68 ) , but can be equal , adding to the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "additional ground states can be generated by removing steps from the inside and adding them to the outside end , until the corner is reached .",
    "also , if the tight spiral ends at a corner or one or two steps further , additional groundstates arise by rearranging these last steps .",
    "we enumerated all osaws with @xmath63 parallel contacts and length up to @xmath69 , and confirmed that all groundstates can be generated with these operations . assuming that no new types of degenerate groundstates arise after @xmath69 , we calculated the degeneracy of the ground state for lengths up to a million steps , and observed that the degeneracy fluctuates between 4 ( for a complete ` square ' tight spiral ) and @xmath70 with @xmath71 , whereas the expected degeneracy grows as @xmath72 with @xmath73 . for @xmath57 and 100 , there are 140 , 40 , 16 , 4 , 16 , and 8 configurations with the maximum number of parallel contacts .",
    "we have added these results of the tight spirals in figure [ exactenum ] as squares .    for @xmath74",
    ", the monte carlo data in figure [ exactenum ] for small @xmath8 do not extrapolate to the exact results for tight spirals , but point below , which suggest that eq .",
    "( [ partfunc ] ) is an upper bound for @xmath75 .",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ exactenum ] represent these upper bounds .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that for @xmath74 the partition function initially stays below these dotted lines , then increases and crosses this dotted line for intermediate values of @xmath8 , and finally reaches the exact result for tight spirals ; however , we think that that scenario is unlikely , and the results concerning long osaws in the remainder of this section are based on the assumption that the dotted lines in figure [ exactenum ] represent upper bounds .    for @xmath76 we know @xmath77 and @xmath78 by exact enumeration , and for @xmath79 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 1000 and 2000 we know @xmath80 and @xmath81 accurately from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "this enables us to compute @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ partfunc ] ) for all these values of @xmath11 . for large @xmath11",
    ", @xmath43 converges to a constant value around 0.031 . to extract the specific heat and density of parallel contacts",
    ", we used a fit to @xmath43 which is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "we can obtain the values @xmath45 in eq .",
    "[ partfunc ] from equations ( [ totnum ] ) , ( [ tighteq ] ) , and ( [ pn ] ) , as @xmath84 for @xmath11=1000 and 2000 , this equation predicts that @xmath45=1.099 and 1.060 , respectively , whereas the monte carlo results in table [ pntable ] for @xmath85 indicate that the slope of @xmath42 corresponds to values of @xmath86 ; for larger values of @xmath11 the curves of @xmath42 versus @xmath8 initially point below the point corresponding to the tight - spiral configuration , and thus must bend upwards at larger @xmath8 .    for @xmath11 up to @xmath87 we plotted in figure [ specheat ] the specific heat , defined by @xmath88 , and in figure [ mpdens ] we plotted the density of parallel contacts @xmath89 , as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath4 . in both figures we added the graphs for @xmath69 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 and 10,000 , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ partfunc ] ) , as dotted lines . in figure [ specheat ] , the value of @xmath4 where the peak of the specific heat is located is moving backward to @xmath90 , as is the point where @xmath91 is increasing steeply in figure [ mpdens ] .",
    "the jump in the density of parallel contacts ( i.e. , the energy density ) is increasing with increasing @xmath11 , indicating a first order transition .",
    "in fact , assuming eq .",
    "( [ partfunc ] ) one can show analytically that in the limit @xmath28 the function @xmath92 approaches the heaviside stepfunction @xmath93 , and this still holds if eq .",
    "( [ partfunc ] ) is an upper bound rather than an exact expression in the regime between tight spirals and walks with few parallel contacts .",
    "both the specific heat and the density of parallel contacts are insensitive to the fact mentioned earlier , that the curve starts somewhat steeper at small @xmath8 and thus must bend up at larger @xmath8 . if anything , they will increase the peak value of the specific heat , and the steepness of the density curve .    another way to estimate",
    "the transition point is to look at the zeroes of the partition function @xcite .",
    "the partition function of an osaw of @xmath11 steps with @xmath8 parallel contacts is a polynomial of degree @xmath63 ( the maximum number of parallel contacts ) in the variable @xmath94 , hence it can be conveniently written in terms of its @xmath11 roots @xmath95 in the complex plane : @xmath96 and the free energy per steps @xmath97 the coefficients @xmath98 are real and non - negative , hence none of the roots lies on the real positive axis , but for @xmath28 they will cross it at some point @xmath99 , since we rigorously know the existence of a phase transition .",
    "we calculated the zeroes of the partition function corresponding to the exact data up to @xmath32 and they are plotted in figure [ zeroes]a . the roots seem to lie in nearly perfect circles for every @xmath11 , but the radius decreases with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath100 roots nearest to the real positive axis approach the real axis along a nearly straight line . in figure [ zeroes]b",
    ", we plotted the real part of the root nearest to the real axis for @xmath101 , against @xmath102 .",
    "again , the figures are consistent with a transition at @xmath103 .",
    "the second major topic of this paper is to investigate the behavior of the number of parallel contacts @xmath8 in the limit @xmath28 . in figure [ mpplot ]",
    "we have plotted the behavior of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath11 , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ partfunc ] ) , which we proposed to be an upper bound .",
    "the upper bound reaches asymptotically the value @xmath105 .",
    "clearly , the earlier mentioned fact that the curve has a somewhat steeper slope at large @xmath11 and small @xmath8 has impact on @xmath29 , as these configurations are dominant at @xmath104 .",
    "therefore we do not use eq .",
    "( [ partfunc ] ) in the remainder of this section . with monte carlo simulations",
    "we have determined the expected number of parallel contacts @xmath29 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the results are given in table [ mpexp ] and figure [ mpplot ] , and are in agreement with results published earlier by one of us @xcite , but extend to larger values of @xmath11 .",
    "the monte carlo results seem to converge to a value around 0.05 .",
    "to understand the underlying physics in the regime @xmath104 better , we took a closer look on _ where _ the parallel contacts are made , and relate this to other types of saws . consider an oriented osaw of length @xmath11 , with a parallel contact between the steps @xmath62 and @xmath106 of the walk .",
    "the sequence of steps from @xmath62 to @xmath106 constitute a polygon of length @xmath107 , if one of the two steps that form a contact is rotated 90 degrees to close the polygon .",
    "the remaining sequences of steps from @xmath108 to @xmath62 and from @xmath106 to @xmath11 are two self - avoiding walks of length @xmath62 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "these two saws can be combined into one self - avoiding two - legged star : a saw of length @xmath110 , on which one special point ( the origin of the two - legged star ) is marked .",
    "note that , since the two saws are separated by the loop , one being located on the inside of the loop and one on the outside , the two - legged star is always self - avoiding .",
    "the mapping of an osaw with one parallel contact into a rooted polygon plus a two - legged star is illustrated in figure [ twolegged ] .",
    "if an osaw has more than one parallel contacts , then we can map this osaw onto different combinations of a rooted polygon plus a two - legged star .",
    "in general , if the osaw has @xmath8 parallel contacts , there are @xmath8 such mappings into a rooted polygon plus a two - legged star .",
    "the reverse mapping , i.e. the combination of a two - legged star plus a rooted polygon into an osaw with a parallel contact , is not guaranteed to result in an osaw with a parallel contact , as they might cross .",
    "therefore , the total number of rooted polygons of length @xmath111 times the total number of two - legged stars of length @xmath110 , summed over all @xmath111 , is an upper bound to the number of osaws of length @xmath11 , multiplied by the expectation value of the number of parallel contacts for these walks .",
    "let us define @xmath112 as the probability that a two - legged star of length @xmath110 if combined with a rooted polygon of length @xmath111 , results in an osaw .",
    "then we can write @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the number of osaws , rooted polygons and two - legged stars of length @xmath11 , respectively .    we know that , for large @xmath11 : @xmath117    combining this with ( [ expm ] ) leads to :    @xmath118    we can obtain insight in the behavior of the function @xmath112 by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "osaws are sampled randomly , and for each parallel contact the loop length @xmath119 is determined , where @xmath62 and @xmath106 are the steps making the parallel contact .",
    "this procedure gives us @xmath120 , the expectation value of the number of parallel contacts with loop length @xmath111 .",
    "results for osaws with a length of @xmath121200 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , and 5000 are plotted in figure [ mploop ] .",
    "@xmath120 shows a power - law behavior , where the length @xmath11 of the osaw is an upper bound to the length @xmath111 of the loop .",
    "important however is that , besides this obvious dependence , the total length @xmath11 does not appear to have any influence on the behavior of @xmath120 , and this quantity is well described by a power - law : @xmath122 numerically , we find : @xmath123 to obtain the mean number of parallel contacts @xmath29 we sum over all possible ( even ) lengths @xmath111 of the rooted polygon : @xmath124 for @xmath125 the right hand side equals a constant times the function @xmath126 , which converges to a constant for @xmath127 .",
    "this implies again that @xmath29 tends to a constant in agreement with earlier monte carlo results of flesia @xcite .    the fact that @xmath29 is constant implies that the saw critical exponent @xmath128 is constant in the free and repulsive regime ( i.e. for @xmath129 ) , and presumably until the transition . for the exponent @xmath128 to change with @xmath4 ,",
    "the exponent @xmath130 should be @xmath131 , since this will cause the @xmath132 function to diverge , but this is not supported by our numerical results in fig .",
    "it is possible to put an upper limit to how far @xmath29 will still increase if @xmath11 is increased above 5000 : figure [ mploop ] shows that the contribution of loops with a length below 1000 certainly has converged for @xmath133 , thus @xmath134 .    a different approach which estimates both the number of parallel and anti - parallel contacts is to use the similarity between an osaw and a twin - tailed tadpole .",
    "consider an osaw with a contact between steps @xmath62 and @xmath106 of the walk . if we add a new edge between steps @xmath62 and @xmath106 we obtain an object which we will call a _ twin - tailed loop _",
    "( see figure 8) .",
    "a twin - tailed loop differs from a non - uniform twin - tailed tadpole only by one edge , and has the same asymptotic behavior .",
    "if the contact is parallel then the twin tailed loop has one tail inside the loop and the other outside ( see fig 8a ) , while if the contact is anti - parallel both tails are outside ( see fig 8b ) .",
    "this is of course only true in two dimensions .",
    "each osaw with @xmath135 contacts can be mapped into @xmath135 distinct twin - tailed loops .",
    "if @xmath136 is the total number of twin - tailed loops of total length @xmath11 then it follows that @xmath137 dividing both sides by @xmath114 , where @xmath114 is the partition function of saws , it follows that @xmath138 asymptotically , @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the exponent for saws .",
    "lookmann  @xcite proved that twin - tailed tadpoles have the same growth constant @xmath17 as saws and that the exponent @xmath128 is @xmath141 .",
    "the same kind of proof holds for twin - tailed loops . replacing these results in eq .",
    "( [ ttt ] ) implies the known result @xmath142 .",
    "consider now the parallel and the anti - parallel case separately .",
    "twin - tailed loops with both tails outside the loop are the dominant configurations , so they have the exponent @xmath128 of the total set , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath141 .",
    "this implies as previously that @xmath25 as was proven by one of us  @xcite .",
    "parallel contacts correspond to the subset @xmath143 of twin - tailed loops with one tail on the inside and one on the outside of the loop .",
    "the question is , what is the value of the exponent @xmath128 ( let us call this exponent @xmath144 ) for this subset @xmath143 ? simple tadpoles ( _ i.e. _ tadpoles with only one tail ) have the same @xmath128 as saws  @xcite .",
    "since one element of @xmath143 can be constructed from a simple tadpole by adding one edge inside the loop , it follows that @xmath145 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath143 is a subset of the set of twin - tailed loops , it follows that @xmath146 , and this inequality can be made strict by considering that @xmath147 , see bennett - wood _ et al._@xcite .",
    "we can gain insight in this matter by randomly generating osaws of length @xmath11 , and for each parallel contact determining the length @xmath148 of the inside tail .",
    "note that if a parallel contact is formed between steps @xmath62 and @xmath106 of the osaw , the steps from @xmath62 to @xmath106 form a loop , and ` inside ' and ` outside ' tails refer to inside or outside this loop .",
    "the results are plotted in figure 9 . extrapolating these results we estimate that the fraction of twin - tailed loops with length @xmath148 of the inside tail is decreasing as @xmath149 where @xmath150 .",
    "the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath151 are within each others statistical errors and are probably the same . as in eq .",
    "( [ inside ] ) the parameter @xmath151 exceeds 1 , @xmath152 will not be more than a constant times @xmath153 .",
    "this implies that @xmath143 asymptotically seems to behave as simple tadpoles which have the same @xmath128 as saws . if we assume , based on these numerical results and intuitive arguments , that the twin - tailed loops with one tail inside and one outside behave as simple tadpoles then @xmath154 , which would imply that @xmath29 approaches a constant .",
