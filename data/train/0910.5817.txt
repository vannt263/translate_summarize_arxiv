    "the large data samples accumulated at the @xmath11 factories allows us to study the properties of baryonic @xmath11 meson decays , which are less well understood than @xmath11 decays into mesons .",
    "an interesting hierarchy has been established experimentally in branching fractions of baryonic @xmath11 decays , namely @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the above decays proceed via @xmath13 tree diagrams .",
    "the corresponding hierarchy has not yet been confirmed in charmless baryonic @xmath11 decays , which presumably proceed via @xmath14 penguin or @xmath15 tree diagrams .",
    "so far , many three - body charmless baryonic @xmath11 decays have been observed but only very stringent upper limits have been set for quasi - two - body decays  @xcite .",
    "one intriguing experimental finding in charmless baryonic three - body decays is that all the baryon - antibaryon mass distributions peak near threshold .",
    "many theoretical investigations , using qcd counting rules  @xcite or pole models  @xcite in the factorization approach , have been carried out for charmless baryonic @xmath11 decays with @xmath5 in the final state .",
    "these theoretical results on the branching fractions and the shape of the baryon - antibaryon mass spectrum agree reasonably well with the experimental findings . however , the proton angular distribution of the threshold peak observed in @xmath16  @xcite seems to violate the short - distance @xmath14 picture and awaits a theoretical explanation .",
    "since the @xmath17 hyperon could be a useful tool to probe the @xmath14 process  @xcite and the related three - body decays can be used for a t - violation study  @xcite , it is of general interest to search for additional charmless baryonic decay modes .    in this paper , we present for the first time a study of the four - body charmless baryonic decay @xmath18  @xcite in order to test the multi - body hierarchy in the charmless case .",
    "to investigate the threshold enhancement effect found in three - body decays , we study partial branching fractions as a function of the baryon - antibaryon mass .",
    "we also search for possible intermediate three - body decays to the same @xmath19 final states , such as @xmath20 .",
    "the data sample used in this study corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 605 fb@xmath21 and contains 657 @xmath22 pairs collected with the belle detector on the @xmath3 resonance at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath23 ( 3.5  gev and 8  gev ) collider  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter composed of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath24 mesons and to identify muons .",
    "the belle detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria for the final state particles of @xmath18 are based on information obtained from the tracking system ( svd and cdc ) and the hadron identification system ( cdc , acc , and tof ) .",
    "we use the same requirements as those described in ref .",
    "candidate @xmath11 mesons are identified with the following two kinematic variables in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame : the beam - energy - constrained mass @xmath25 , and the energy difference @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the beam energy , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the momentum and energy , respectively , of the reconstructed @xmath11 meson .",
    "we define a candidate region as 5.20 gev/@xmath30 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath32 gev @xmath33 gev .",
    "the lower bound in @xmath34 is chosen to exclude all backgrounds due to baryonic @xmath11 decays with higher multiplicities . from a geant  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , the signal peaks in a signal box defined by the requirements 5.27 gev/@xmath35 gev/@xmath31 and @xmath36 gev .",
    "after the above selection requirements , the background in the candidate region arises predominantly from continuum @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) processes .",
    "we suppress jet - like continuum background relative to the more spherical @xmath39 signal using a fisher discriminant  @xcite that combines seventeen event shape variables as described in ref .",
    "we then optimize the coefficients separately in seven different missing - mass regions defined in ref .",
    "@xcite to improve the signal - to - background ratio",
    ". probability density functions ( pdfs ) for the fisher discriminant and the cosine of the angle between the @xmath11 flight direction and the beam direction in the @xmath3 rest frame are combined to form the signal ( background ) likelihood @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the signal pdfs are determined using signal mc simulation ; the background pdfs are obtained from the sideband region of the data : @xmath42 gev/@xmath31 @xmath43 gev/@xmath31 or @xmath44 gev .",
    "we require the likelihood ratio @xmath45 to be greater than 0.85 for all seven missing - mass regions .",
    "this value is determined by optimizing @xmath46 as a function of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the expected numbers of signal and background events in the signal box , respectively .",
    "we assume a signal branching fraction of @xmath50 to estimate @xmath48 and use the data sideband events to determine @xmath49 .    to ensure that the decay process is genuinely charmless",

    "this selection removed about 4.8% of candidate events .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath11 background component with @xmath60 has a @xmath34 distribution that is different from signal .. this is included in the systematic uncertainty from pdf modeling by comparing the fit results with and without this background component in the fit . if there are multiple @xmath11 candidates in a single event , we select the one with the best @xmath61 value for the @xmath62 vertex fit .",
    "the fraction of multiple @xmath11 candidate events is 18.8% .",
    "the systematic errors due to multiple @xmath11 candidates are described later .",
