    "<S> in high energy heavy ion collisions , the directed flow of particles is conventionally measured with respect to that of the projectile spectators , which is defined as positive @xmath0 direction . </S>",
    "<S> but it is not known if the spectators deflect in the `` outward '' direction or `` inward ''  toward the center line of the collision . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the measurements of the directed flow at mid - rapidity , especially in asymmetric collision such as cu+au , can be used to answer this question . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the existing data strongly favor the case that the spectators , in the ultrarelativistic collisions , on average deflect outwards .    in an ultrarelativistic nuclear collision </S>",
    "<S> only part of all nucleons from the colliding nuclei experience a truly inelastic collision . </S>",
    "<S> some of nucleons , called spectators , stay mostly intact ( or might experience a transition to an excited state ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , those nucleons do experience a nonzero momentum transfer and deflect from the original nucleus trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of such projectile nucleon ( `` spectator '' ) deflection is conventionally taken as a positive @xmath0 direction in the description of any anisotropic particle production ( anisotropic flow  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , while this direction has been measured experimentally at very low collision energies , nothing is known on which direction the spectators really deflect at high energies  toward the center of the collision , or outwards . </S>",
    "<S> note that this question is not of a pure `` academic '' interest , it is intimately related to understanding of the nucleon wave function in the nucleus , as well as momentum distribution of the nucleons confined in a nucleus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important for the interpretation of the anisotropic flow measurements . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the spectator flow is requited for determination of the direction of the magnetic field created in the collision as well as the system orbital momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , for example , is needed for the measurements of the so - called global polarization  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the only ( known to authors ) direct determination of the spectator nucleons deflection direction was performed at the energies @xmath1100  mev by measuring of the polarization of emitted photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was observed ( see also  @xcite ) that around this energy the direction of the deflection direction changes from the `` in - ward '' ( due to attractive potential at lower energies ) to the `` out - ward '' at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> no similar measurements was performed at higher collision energies . theoretically , this question is also not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> as recently has been shown in  @xcite , the direction of the spectator deflection is likely dependent on the nucleon transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations show that at relatively large transverse momentum ( more than @xmath2200  mev ) the nucleons are likely deflected inwards , while at low transverse momentum they might deflect outwards . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for the latter might be the coulomb interaction ( repulsion ) of the spectator protons .        in this article we show how the study of the charge particle directed flow at midrapidity measured relative to the spectator deflection direction ( directed flow ) can help to answer the question of which direction the spectators are deflected on average . </S>",
    "<S> we do not distinguish between low and high @xmath3 spectators in this study , though in principle this question can be studied experimentally .    the main idea of our approach is based on the observation that in the case of asymmetric initial density distribution in the system , the high(er ) transverse momentum particles on average are flowing / emitted in the direction of the largest density gradient , while the lower @xmath3 particles flow in the opposite direction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the mean transverse momentum of all particles is zero ( e.g at midrapidity region in symmetric collisions ) then the average , integrated over all transverse momenta , directed flow is in the same direction as that of low @xmath3 particles .    </S>",
    "<S> then the strategy in the establishing the direction of the spectator flow becomes straight - forward . </S>",
    "<S> first , one has to measure the directed flow of particles at midrapidity with respect to the spectator deflection . comparing that to the initial density gradients calculated relative to the position of spectators </S>",
    "<S> , one can determine the direction of spectator flow . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the highest density gradient in the system has to be determined with the help of a model , but this appears to be a very robust procedure , as this direction depends mostly on the distribution of the matter inside the nucleus . as we argue below , there is no real model dependence / ambiguity here . in asymmetric collisions , such as cu+au , the direction of the density gradient can be established unambiguously on average , over all events . in symmetric collisions , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. au+au at rhic or pb+pb at lhc , one has to account for the fluctuation nature of the density distribution and look for the density gradients relative to the position of the spectators .    to quantify the anisotropic flow we use a standard fourier decomposition of the azimuthal particle distribution with respect to the @xmath4-th harmonic symmetry planes  @xcite : @xmath5 \\!\\right ) ,   \\label{eqfourier}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the @xmath4-th harmonic flow coefficient and @xmath7 is the @xmath4-th harmonic symmetry plane determined by the initial geometry of the system ( as given by the participant nucleon distribution , see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to model calculations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) the event - by - event fluctuations in anisotropic flow closely follow the fluctuations in the corresponding eccentricities of the initial density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> following  @xcite , for the latter we use the definition , for @xmath8 : _ n , x=_n(n_n)=-/ + _ n , y=_n(n_n)=-/ and for @xmath9 ( most important for this study ) _ 13,x=_13(_13)=-/ + _ 13,y=_13(_13)=-/ where @xmath10 is the so - called _ participant _ eccentricity  @xcite . in our monte - carlo model , in calculations of the average quantities in eccentricity definitions we weight with the number of participating nucleons ( those undergoing inelastic collision ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the nucleon distribution in the nuclei we use the woods - saxon density distribution with standard parameters ( for the exact values see  @xcite ) ; the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section is taken to be 42  mb for calculations of at @xmath11  gev ( cu+au collisions discussed below ) and 64  mb for @xmath12  tev ( pb+pb collisions ) . in our model calculations we chose the positive `` x '' direction to point along the impact parameter vector , and assume that the spectators deflect in the `` outwards '' direction ( target spectators flow in the impact parameter vector direction , as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coll ] ) , and then check if this agrees with the experimental observations .    there exist several measurements of directed flow at midrapidity relative to the spectator nucleons in au+au and cu+cu collisions at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , all those measurements reported only rapidity odd component of the directed flow , that is not suitable for our discussion , as in symmetric collision this component is exactly zero at midrapidity . </S>",
    "<S> rapidity even component , not zero at midrapidity even in symmetric collisions due to fluctuations in initial density distribution , has been measured only in pb+pb collisions at lhc by alice collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will analyze these measurements below first , and then discuss less ambiguous directed flow measurements in asymmetric cu+au collisions at @xmath11  gev by phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite collaborations .     </S>",
    "<S> as function of the difference in number of target and projectile nucleon participants in pb+pb collision in the impact parameter range @xmath13  fm . ]    in symmetric nuclear collisions , such as pb+pb , the directed flow at midrapidity due to density fluctuations , if measured relative to the projectile spectator flow , can be non - zero only due to decorrelation in the flow directions of target and projectile spectators ( and corresponding geometry ) or fluctuations in the relative reaction plane resolutions due to fluctuations in the number of the spectators . </S>",
    "<S> we test the latter by calculating the directed flow at midrapidity , @xmath14 , as a function of the difference in the number of projectile and target participants . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such calculations for the impact parameter range @xmath13  fm is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : psi13npart ] . from that plot </S>",
    "<S> it follows that in the case of the smaller number of projectile participants @xmath15 and the average directed flow would be negative . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller number of participants corresponds to the larger number of spectators that have to lead to better event plane resolution and thus dominate the measurements . having in mind </S>",
    "<S> that the measurements  @xcite indicate _ negative _ rapidity even component of the directed flow one has to conclude that the flow of spectators must be `` outward '' ( as assumed in the model ) . </S>",
    "<S> this reasoning one can check with direct measurement of flow as a function of the difference in number of spectators ( e.g. as measured by zero degree calorimeters ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately at present there is no such results published .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the projectile and target spectator flow direction decorrelation , and the correlations of the corresponding directions with the direction of the density gradient at midrapidity , can be studied as follows . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the direction of the spectator flow is along the line between the center of the nucleus and the `` center of gravity '' of the projectile spectators in the transverse plane . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the corresponding angle @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the correlation of that angle with @xmath17 , indicative of the direction of the ( participant ) density gradients that determined directed flow at midrapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these calculations for pb+pb collision are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cospsi13 ] by open red markers . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see a positive correlations , which again would lead to a conclusion that an average the flow at midrapidity should be negative ( recall that on average the directed flow is in the opposite direction to @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> blue open points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cospsi13 ] show the results for @xmath19 and are consistent with zero as expected for symmetric nuclear collisions .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 as function of the impact parameter for pb+pb collisions at @xmath12  tev ( open markers ) and cu+au collisions at 200  gev ( filled markers ) . in cu+au collisions </S>",
    "<S> the au nucleus is defined as the projectile ; @xmath16 is calculated using au spectators . ]    while the discussion above about directed flow at midrapidity in symmetric collisions is based on rather subtle details of the treatment / modeling of the fluctuations in the initial density distributions , in the asymmetric collisions , such as cu+au , the direction of the density gradient practically is insensitive to the fluctuations . in this case , the line of arguments and the conclusion become totally unambiguous . in the calculations discussed below we treat au nucleus as the projectile , and au spectators are used in calculations of the angle @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : d2xy ] presents the nucleon participant distributing in cu+au collisions in the impact parameter range @xmath13  fm . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution looks rather symmetric , but a more detail study indicates that the density gradient is larger in the positive `` x '' direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cospsi13 ] ( filled blue points ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the density fluctuations and the corresponding correlations between the density gradients and the position of spectators ( shown by red points ) is rather insignificant in this case unless one considers very central collisions . in peripheral collision </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the red points are slightly below the blue points , which can be explained by the decorrelations of the direction of spectator flow relative to the reaction plane determined by the impact parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of directed flow at midrapidity in cu+au collisions  @xcite show that charge particles at midrapidity on average flow in the opposite direction to that of the projectile spectators . </S>",
    "<S> thus , once again , we are to conclude that on the average the spectators flow `` outward '' from the collision center . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the experimental values of the mean @xmath20 in cu+au collisions is about an order of magnitude larger than the values of even @xmath20 in pb+pb collisions ( while the magnitude of the odd @xmath20 component at lhc is only about 3 times smaller than that at top rhic energies ) - which is consistent with much stronger values of @xmath21 in cu+au collisions compared to pb+pb collisions as shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : cospsi13 ] .    fm . </S>",
    "<S> positive @xmath0 direction is toward the au nucleus . ]    in summary , we have analyzed the recent directed flow measurements at midrapidity in pb+pb collisions at lhc and cu+au collisions at rhic in order to determine the direction of flow of the spectator nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that all the measurements strongly supports the picture of spectators flowing `` outward '' from the collision center - line . </S>"
