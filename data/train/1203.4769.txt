    "the parity - violating ( pv ) hadronic processes in low - energy regions have been one of the most fundamental issues in nuclear and hadronic physics for long time ( see a recent review  @xcite for some historical and phenomenological background ) .",
    "however , the weak interactions of hadrons are yet poorly understood because of the strong interaction , compared to lepton - lepton or lepton - hadron weak processes .",
    "for example , the long - standing puzzle of the @xmath5 rule in strangeness - changing weak interactions indicates that the effect of the strong interaction in weak processes raises a non - trivial problem  @xcite .",
    "it is even more difficult to study parity - violating nuclear processes because of experimental feasibility and theoretical complication caused by the nonperturbative strong interaction of quarks and gluons .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) asserts that charged weak boson exchange induces flavor - changing weak interactions whereas the neutral current conserves the flavor .",
    "the basic ingredient to describe low - energy hadronic weak processes is the quark current - current interaction with @xmath6 and @xmath7 bosons .",
    "however , in order to describe low - energy phenomena below 1 gev , one has to scale down this interaction from the mass scale of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in the course of this scaling , the quark - gluon interactions are encoded in the wilson coefficients by the renormalization group equation  @xcite , which , however , explains only a perturbative part of the strong interaction .",
    "desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh )  @xcite suggested that hadronic and nuclear pv processes can be described by one - boson exchange such as @xmath8- , @xmath9- , and @xmath10-exchanges  @xcite  la the strong nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) potential .",
    "the main factors of the pv @xmath11 potential are the seven weak meson-@xmath11 coupling constants , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where superscripts denote the isospin difference @xmath18 . among these coupling constants ,",
    "it is of utmost importance to understand the pv @xmath0 coupling constant , because it governs the long - range part of the pv @xmath11 interaction , so that it plays the most signicant role in explaining the pv nuclear processes .",
    "the pv @xmath0 coupling constant can in principle be extracted from various pv reactions @xmath19",
    "@xcite , and @xmath20  @xcite but is fraught with large undertainties .",
    "we refer to a recent review  @xcite for the present status of hadronic pv experiments .",
    "it has been also calculated in various theoretical frameworks : the @xmath21 quark model  @xcite with the effective weak hamiltonian , the skyrme model  , and qcd sum rules  @xcite , and so on . even though a great amount of efforts was made on understanding @xmath1 experimentally as well as theoretically , its quantitative value is still elusive .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the pv @xmath0 coupling constant , @xmath1 , within the framework of the su(2 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath22qsm ) which is an effective chiral model for qcd in the low - energy region with constituent quarks and the pseudoscalar mesons as the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the model respects the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry and describes baryons fully relativistically .",
    "moreover , it is deeply related to the qcd vacuum based on instantons  @xcite and contains only a few free parameters .",
    "these parameters can mostly be fixed to the meson masses and meson decay constants in the mesonic sector .",
    "the only remaining free parameter is the constituent quark mass or dynamical quark mass that is also fixed by reproducing the electric properties of the proton .",
    "the @xmath22qsm was successful in describing lowest - lying baryon properties  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the renormalization scale for the @xmath22qsm is naturally given by the cut - off parameter for the regularization which is about @xmath23 .",
    "note that it is implicitly related to the inverse of the size of instantons ( @xmath24 )  @xcite .",
    "this renormalization scale is very important in general , because the essential feature of the pv hadronic interactions comes from the effective weak hamiltonian that has a specific scale dependence , as mentioned previously .",
    "thus , the matching of this scale consists of an essential part in investigatng any nonleptonic decays and pv hadronic processes .    while the @xmath22qsm provides a plausible framework to study the pv @xmath0 coupling constant ,",
    "there are at least two theoretical difficulties .",
    "firstly , the effective weak hamiltonian has two - body operators and one has to treat the four - point correlation functions in order to compute the pv @xmath0 coupling constant .",
    "secondly , since the momentum - dependent dynamical quark mass is known to play a significant role in describing @xmath25 nonleptonic decays  @xcite , one can expect that it would also contribute to @xmath1 substantially .",
    "this is in particular important , because a certain amount of non - perturbative effects is reflected in the momentum - dependent quark mass , which arises from the zero mode of instantons .",
    "however , it is very difficult to handle these problems in the self - consistent @xmath22qsm . in order to circumvent all technical difficulties in the self - consistent approach",
    ", we will use the gradient expansion to calculate @xmath1 , taking the limit of a large soliton size , so that valence quarks in a nucleon plunge into the dirac sea and the soliton emerges as a topological one  @xcite , which is quite similar to a skyrmion .",
    "equivalently , we can start directly from the @xmath2 effective weak chiral lagrangian derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and quantize the chiral soliton collectively .",
    "then , we introduce a physical pion through quantum fluctuations around the soliton field . this procedure will lead to the results for @xmath1 without fitting any parameter . in the present work",
    ", we will restrict ourselves the su(2 ) case for simplicity and will concentrate on how the low - energy constants ( lecs ) found in ref .",
    "@xcite feature the pv @xmath0 coupling constant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : lag ] , we describe briefly a general formalism for the derivation of the pv weak @xmath0 coupling constant . in section [ sec : res ]",
    "we present the numerical results for @xmath1 and discuss the role of the lecs of the @xmath2 effective weak chiral lagrangian .",
    "the last section is devoted to the summary and outlook of this work .",
    "in this section , we will show how to incorporate the @xmath2 effective weak hamiltonian into the effective chiral action .",
    "we employ the @xmath2 effective weak hamiltonian derived in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath26 , \\label{eq : heff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath27 is defined as a two - body operator @xmath28 in euclidean space , and @xmath29 denotes the generator of the color @xmath30 group , normalized as @xmath31 .",
    "the definitions of the matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath9 can be found in @xcite .",
    "these coefficients are the functions of the scale - dependent wilson coefficient @xmath37 defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the strong running coupling constant , @xmath40 stands for the renormalization point that specifies the energy scale , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the mass of the @xmath6 boson . the coefficient @xmath43 encodes the effect of the strong interaction from perturbative gluon exchanges .",
    "the four - quark operators are expressed generically by @xmath44 where @xmath45 labels each four - quark operator in the effective weak hamiltonian and @xmath46 consist of the dirac gamma and flavor matrices .",
    "thus , the effective weak hamiltonian can be rewritten as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath9 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) .    in order to derive @xmath4 in the @xmath22qsm",

    "it is , however , extremely complicated to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr2 ] ) numerically , since the pv @xmath0 coupling constant involves the two - body quark operators @xmath75 and the axial - vector one , which will lead to laborious triple sums in quark levels already at the leading order .",
    "moreover , the momentum - dependent quark mass , which is known to be of great significance in describing nonleptonic processes  @xcite , introduces in addition technical difficulties  @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid these complexities is to use a gradient expansion taking @xmath76  @xcite or equivalently is to start from the effective weak chiral lagrangian already derived in ref .",
    "note that though we did not carry out the derivative expansion to order @xmath77 , it is not difficult to estimate how large the corresponding lecs could be . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath78 effective weak chiral lagrangian to order @xmath77 was investigated in the case of the local chiral quark model .",
    "as one can see , all of the lecs are order - of - magnitude smaller than the @xmath79 lecs . in this sense , even though we go further beyond the leading order , the contribution from higher derivative terms will not enhance or suppress @xmath80 much .",
    "it will be at most below @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we will use the @xmath2 effective weak chiral lagrangian derived in ref .  @xcite as our starting point , instead of dealing with eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the present approach goes beyond the previous analyses in the skyrme model  @xcite , because the present scheme incorporates properly the effects of the perturbative quark - gluon strong interaction in the derivation of the pv @xmath0 coupling constant .",

    "we find out from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that @xmath4 is rather sensitive to the wilson coefficient @xmath43 and it decreases monotonically , as @xmath43 increases . we notice that its sign is even changed around @xmath190 .",

    "the solid curve draws the result of @xmath191 , dashed one depicts that of @xmath165 , and the short - dashed one does that of @xmath166 . ]",
    "since @xmath165 is the main contribution to @xmath4 , we want to examine it in detail . we can easily see that the first term of eq.([eq : n9 ] ) containing the quark condensate is much larger than the second one .",
    "moreover , since @xmath193 and @xmath194 are much smaller than the other two coefficients @xmath195 and @xmath196 , we can neglect them in @xmath165 .",
    "then , @xmath165 can be expressed as @xmath197 as shown in eq.([eq : heff ] ) , the coefficient @xmath195 comes from the original effective weak hamiltonian at the mass scale of the @xmath6 boson @xmath198 corresponding to @xmath199 . in this case , only @xmath195 survives in @xmath165 . however , when we start to scale the hamiltonian down to @xmath200 that corresponds to @xmath201 , the gluonic renormalization arising from gluon exchange parallel to @xmath7-boson exchange is turned on . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath202 term becomes as large as a half of the @xmath195 one  @xcite at this scale .",
    "if one goes further down to the scale at which @xmath203  , the correction of @xmath196 cancels out the contribution of @xmath195 , so that @xmath4 almost vanishes , as already shown in figs .  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .",
    "this cancellation implies that the effects of the gluon renormalization leads to the suppression of the pv @xmath0 coupling constant in the present approach of the su(2 ) @xmath22qsm .    since ref .",
    "@xcite derived the effective weak chiral lagrangian based on the @xmath2 effective weak hamiltonian , it is plausible to take the value @xmath204 for @xmath4 , which corresponds to the renormalization scale of the charm quark mass @xmath205 gev as done for the @xmath78 case  @xcite . thus , we obtain @xmath206 for @xmath204 . however , if one neglects all the renormalization effects , i.e. if one takes @xmath199 , we have @xmath207 , which is similar to that of the su(2 ) skyrme model with vector mesons ( @xmath208 )  @xcite in which the effective weak hamiltonian at @xmath209 or with @xmath199 was used .",

    "the wilson coefficient @xmath204 is used , which corresponds to @xmath205 gev . ]    very recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has reported the first result of lattice qcd : @xmath211 with the pion mass @xmath212 mev .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare the present result with the lattice one . in order to do that",
    ", we need to examine the dependence of @xmath4 on the pion mass @xmath176 .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] depicts the pv @xmath0 coupling constant as a function of @xmath176 .",
    "we employ here the physical profile function with @xmath204 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath4 starts to increase , as @xmath176 does . as a result",
    ", @xmath4 turns out to be around @xmath213 for @xmath214 mev .",
    "though it is still around five times less than that of the lattice calculation , we can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] that lattice results with the physical pion mass might be quite smaller than that of ref .",
    ". moreover , if one takes @xmath199 , @xmath4 with @xmath215 mev would become @xmath216 that is comparable to the lattice one , though the value @xmath199 does not seem tenable for @xmath4 as discussed previously .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that ref .",
    "@xcite has not performed the calculation of the full matrix element , since the quark - loop diagrams were omitted because of technical difficulties .",
    "a quantitative comparison with full lattice calculations is still being awaited .",
    "we have investigated the parity - violating pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath4 within the framework of the chiral quark - soliton model with the gradient expansion used . starting from the @xmath2 effective weak chiral lagrangian derived in the same framework , we have calculated the parity - violating @xmath0 coupling constant .",
    "it was found that it vanished at the leading order in the large @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath217 , which is of order @xmath218 , but it was finite to the next - to - leading order , i.e. @xmath219 .    employing three different profile functions , that is , the arctangent , physical , and linear ones , we calculated the parity - violating @xmath0 coupling constant to the next to the leading oder .",
    "it turns out that the values of @xmath4 depend sensitively on the values of the wilson coefficient @xmath43 and vanishes around @xmath203 .",
    "the reason can be found in the fact that the contribution of the gluonic renormalization constant @xmath196 cancels out that of the @xmath195 , which is the leading one .",
    "it indicates that the perturbative gluonic contribution supresses the parity - violating @xmath220 coupling constant .",
    "taking the scale of the charm quark mass , i.e. @xmath221 gev , we found @xmath222 , which is almost 40 times smaller than the `` best value '' of ref .",
    "if the @xmath209 is selected , the value of @xmath4 turns out to be similar to that from the skyrme model with vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "we also compared the present result with that of the lattice calculation .",
    "thus , we examined the dependence of the parity - violating @xmath0 coupling constant on the pion mass and found that @xmath4 increased as @xmath176 did .",
    "if one uses @xmath214 mev , the result turns out to be almost two times larger than that with the physical value @xmath223 mev but is still about five times smaller than the lattice one .",
    "however , we want to emphasize that neither the present result nor the lattice one is the final one .    in order to understand the parity - violating @xmath0 coupling constant @xmath4",
    "more completely and quantitatively , we have to consider the following important physics : since we have considered the su(2 ) case in the present work , the effects of strangeness were left out . as already mentioned in section  [ sec : lag ] , however , the strange quark operators may play a certain role in describing the parity - violating @xmath0 coupling constant . extending from su(2 ) to su(3 ) is lengthy but straightforward in the present framework .",
    "starting from eqs.([eq : pilag2 ] , [ eq : nlo ] ) , we employ the quantization with the embedding  ( [ eq : embed ] ) .",
    "in particular , the singlet current is distinguishable from the octet one in su(3 ) , so that this would make difference in predicting the parity - violating @xmath0 coupling constant .",
    "moreover , the fourth and fifth flavor components of the vector currents enter the next - to - leading order lagrangian , this would also contribute to @xmath4 .    as was seen in section  [ sec : res ] , the gluon renormalization plays a role of suppressing the parity - violating @xmath0 coupling constant .",
    "however , the effective weak hamiltonian at two - loop order was derived very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the qcd penguin diagrams were also considered .",
    "this hamiltonian is more complete than that from ref .",
    "thus , it is of great significance to investigate the @xmath2 effective weak chiral lagrangian based on this effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "it is also of great interest to see whether these penguin diagrams enhance the @xmath4 or not , since they give part of answers of explaining the @xmath224 rule in nonleptonic decays  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding investigations are under way .",
