    "a connection game is a kind of abstract strategy game in which players try to make a specific type of connection with their pieces  @xcite . in many connection games ,",
    "the goal is to connect two opposite sides of a board . in these games , players take turns placing or / and moving pieces until they connect the two sides of the board .",
    "hex , twixt , and slither are typical examples of this type of game .",
    "however , a connection game can also involve completing a loop ( havannah ) or connecting all the pieces of a color ( lines of action ) .",
    "a typical process in studying an abstract strategy game , and in particular a connection game , is to develop an artificial player for it by adapting standard techniques from the game search literature , in particular the classical alpha - beta algorithm  @xcite or the more recent monte carlo tree search paradigm  @xcite .",
    "these algorithms explore an exponentially large game tree are meaningful when optimal polynomial time algorithms are impossible or unlikely .",
    "for instance , tree search algorithms would not be used for nim and shannon s edge switching game which can be played optimally and solved in polynomial time  @xcite .",
    "the complexity class pspace comprizes those problems that can be solved on a turing machine using an amount of space polynomial in the size of the input .",
    "the prototypical example of a pspace - complete problem is the quantified boolean formula problem ( qbf ) which can be seen as a generalization of sat allowing for variables to be both existentially and universally quantified . proving that a game is pspace - hard shows that a variety of intricate problems can be encoded via positions of this game .",
    "additionally , it is widely believed in complexity theory that if a problem is pspace - hard , then it admits no polynomial time algorithms . for this reason , studying the computational complexity of games",
    "is a popular research topic .",
    "the complexity class of chess and go was determined shortly after the very definition of these classes and other popular games have been classified since then  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we studied the complexity of trick taking card games which notably include bridge , skat , tarot , and whist  @xcite .",
    "connection games have received less attention . besides even and tarjan s proof that shannon s vertex switching game is pspace - complete  @xcite and reisch s proof that hex is pspace - complete  @xcite , the only complexity results on connection games that we know of are the pspace - completeness of virtual connection detection  @xcite in hex , the np - completeness of dominated cell detection in shannon s vertex switching game  @xcite , as well as an unpublished note showing that a problem related to twixt is np - complete  @xcite .",
    "the two games that we study in this paper rank among the most notable connection games .",

    "the havannah board is large enough that the gadgets are far from the edges and the corners .",
    "additionally , the gadgets feature ring threats that are short enough that the bridges and forks winning conditions do not have any influence . before starting the reduction",
    ", we define threats and make two observations that will prove useful in the course of the reduction .",
    "a _ simple threat _ is defined as a move which threatens to realize a ring on the next move on a unique cell .",
    "there are only two kinds of answers to a simple threat : either win on the spot or defend by placing a stone in the cell creating this very threat .",
    "double threat _ is defined as a move which threatens to realize a ring on the next move on at least two different cells .",
    "we will use _ threat _ as a generic term to encompass both simple and double threats .",
    "a _ winning sequence of threats _ is defined as a sequence of simple threats ended by a double threat for one player such that the opponent s forced move never makes a threat .",
    "thus , when a player is not threatened and can initiate a winning sequence of threats , they do win . to be more concise , we will denote by @xmath0,@xmath1 ; @xmath2,@xmath3 ;  ;",
    "@xmath4(,@xmath5 ) the sequence of moves starting with white s move @xmath6 , black s answer @xmath1 , and so on .",

    "similarly , @xmath7,@xmath1 ; @xmath2,@xmath3 ;  ; @xmath4(,@xmath5 ) denotes the corresponding sequence of moves initiating by black .",
    "we will use the following lemmas multiple times :    [ lem : simple - threat ] if a player is not threatened , playing a simple threat forces the opponent to answer on the cell of the threat .",
    "otherwise , no matter what have played their opponent , placing a stone on the cell of the threat wins the game .",
    "[ lem : double - threat ] if a player is not threatened , playing a double threat is winning .    the player is not threatened , so their opponent can not win at their turn .",

    "the proof for twixt is a reduction from hex and applied to twixtpp .",
    "the proof for havannah is more involved and is based on the generalized georgraphy problem restricted to bipartite graphs of degree 3 .",
    "this havannah reduction only used the loop winning condition , but it is easy to show that havannah without the loop winning condition can simulate hex and is pspace - hard as well . for both reductions ,",
    "the size of the resulting game is only linearly larger than the size of the input instance .      in lines of action ,",
    "each player starts with two groups of pieces and tries to connect all their pieces by moving these pieces and possibly capturing opponent pieces  @xcite .",
    "while the goal of lines of action clearly makes it a connection game , the mechanics distinguishes it from more classical connection games as no pieces are added to the board and existing pieces can be moved or removed . as a result , it is not even clear that lines of action is in pspace .",
    "slither is closer to hex but each move actually consists of putting a new stone on the board and possibly moving another one . obtaining a pspace - hardness result for slither is not so easy since the rules allow a player to influence two different areas of the board in a single turn .",
