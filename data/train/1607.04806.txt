    "circularly polarized ( cp ) light possesses spin angular momentum ( sam ) with a helicity defined as its projection to linear momentum of propagating optical wave .",
    "in addition to sam , optical wave can be rendered to possess orbital angular momentum ( oam ) by constructing a vortex beam having helical wavefront.@xcite both sam and oam are utilized to carry informations in optical communication via polarization - division or oam - division multiplexing .",
    "differently from 2 modes of sam with spins of @xmath2 , the number of modes of oam is not restricted since the topological charge of vortex beam is determined by twisting number of the helical wavefront .",
    "owing to the availability of a large number of modes , vortex beams have been widely employed in applications to increase the signal channels for optical communications.@xcite in those applications it is necessary to be able to manipulate and control the intensity and phase distributions of vortex beam .",
    "anisotropic planar structures such as metasurface are important optical elements for such applications when sam is utilized for shaping vortex beam , since interaction of sam and oam with optical beam orbit is enhanced.@xcite    there are several well - known means to create vortex beams , for example , a pair of cylindrical lenses , spiral phase plate , fork - shaped grating , and spatial light modulator as well as photonic integrated devices.@xcite another important means to create vortex beams is to make use of geometric phase by constructing space - variant pancharatnam - berry phase optical elements including subwavelength diffraction grating@xcite and liquid crystal q - plates in spin - to - orbital am conversion ( soc ) process.@xcite related to metasurface , a high - efficiency soc has been demonstrated to generate vortex beams with high topological charges in the visible wavelength based on dielectric metasurfaces.@xcite generation of vortex beam by soc is an example of spin - controlled spatial beam profiling since an incident gaussian beam converts to a vortex beam with donut - shaped spatial beam profile by spin flip . in case of a rotational symmetric pancharatnam - berry phase optical element ,",
    "soc - generated vortex beams with opposite signs of topological charges are degenerate in spatial beam profiles , which results from conservation of angular momentum consisting of spin am and orbital am .",
    "in other words , the beam centers of gravity of vortex beams are the same at that of the incident gaussian beam .",
    "now we address the question how the degeneracy of spatial beam profiles of soc - generated vortex beams can be lifted in soc to provide spin - controlled spatial beam profiling such that the beam centers of gravity of vortex beams with opposite signs of topological charges are spatially separated by transverse - shifting in opposite directions .",
    "optical hall effect is one means to achieve spatial separation by use of spin - dependent transverse shift originating from sam- or oam - orbit interaction , which is also technically important when spatially demultiplexing oam - mode division multiplexed superposition states .    here",
    ", we introduce a cyclic group symmetric metasurface ( cgsm ) to generate vortex beam exhibiting a spin- and orbital - am dependent transverse shift by identifying soc in terms of geometric phase acquired by an optical beam in cross - polarization scattering from ring structure of nano - antennas . by designing cgsms belonging to the cyclic group @xmath3 , dynamical phase of cross - polarization scattered beam",
    "is altered according to the order @xmath1 of cyclic group while keeping geometric phase constant .",
    "when @xmath1-fold rotational symmetry of azimuthal dynamical phase gradient is an odd integer @xmath1 , there results a spin- and orbital - hall effect.@xcite",
    "intrinsic optical spin or orbital hall effect refers to spin - dependent or vortex - charge dependent transverse shift , a consequence of the coupling between sam or oam with optical beam orbit originating from transversality of electromagnetic wave.@xcite . in a general framework of physical description ,",
    "it is an effect of fast degree of freedom ( sam or oam ) on slow degree of freedom ( optical beam orbit ) , described by momentum - space lorentz equation of motion in the presence of a berry curvature of topological monopole .",
    "@xcite spin - dependent transverse shift of optical beam is also achieved by geometric pancharatnam - berry ( pb ) phase in a linear array of nano - antennas , called extrinsic optical spin hall effect , to distinguish from the transverse shift originating from topological monopole .",
    "the amount of shift is related to pb phase as shown in * fig .",

    "in fact , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where a constant @xmath18 leads to @xmath19-independent amplitude @xmath20 from the fact that each two neighboring nano - antennas provide an equal amount of pb phase during one full cycle , owing to rotational invariance of circular array of nano - antennas .    it has been reported that a spin - dependent transverse shift of vortex beam in soc is observed by lifting degeneracy in oam though rotational symmetry breaking without clarifying the underlying role of azimuthal phase gradient in giving rise to extrinsic spin- and orbital - hall effect.@xcite now we examine how the azimuthal phase gradient is closely related to the existence of extrinsic spin- and orbital - hall effect .    consider a circular array of nano - antennas with different sizes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 in the range of @xmath23 , as shown in * fig .",
