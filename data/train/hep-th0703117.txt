    "therefore , in the brane - induced gravity model , the evolution of eccentricity in the brane can also be used to explain the quadrupole problem of the cosmic microwave background .    in summary , we have considered a version of ellipsoidal universe in the brane world scenario . here , we emphasize that the ellipsoidal universe discussed above is undergoing a homogenous but anisotropic expansion .",
    "that is to say , before the onset of inflation , a typical region of the universe is homogeneous and isotropic but in some regions an asymmetric expansion driven by magnetic fields would have stretched out the regions and left with an imprint through the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "the ellipsoidal universe has been used to explain the suppression of quadrupole moment , but not all the low multipoles since in the ellipsoidal coordinate all the coefficients @xmath245 with @xmath246 vanish .",
    "this can be easily found by calculating the formula @xmath247 . in the above discussions",
    ", we have also investigated the ellipsoidal universe in the dgp model and used a large @xmath236 in obtaining the value of eccentricity .",
    "we notice that up to now the comparison between data and the dgp model based upon the expansion history of the universe is still contradictory .",
    "recent data of supernova and cmb suggested that the self - accelerating branch of the dgp model is somehow disfavored @xcite , while the most recent analysis of the new gold data set of supernovae @xcite and the cmb shift parameter suggested that a flat universe is completely consistent with the dgp model @xcite .",
    "however , as the density perturbations of the dgp model may differ from those of @xmath49cdm model , it is still unclear at present whether the dgp model is marginally or significantly disfavored or not @xcite .",
    "a full examination of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , but from eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) we can see that a large enough @xmath236 contributes little to the value of the eccentricity .",
