    "when a simple liquid or a binary mixture is confined in a porous material which has a very low density ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) of spatially fixed impurities , such as in an aerogel , the coexistence region in the phase diagram is substantially narrowed .",
    "this result has been obtained in a broad class of experimental studies , such as vapor  liquid coexistence of @xmath4he@xcite and nitrogen@xcite , binary mixtures of isobutyric acid  water@xcite and @xmath5he@xmath4he@xcite , etc . in all of these studies",
    ", the coexistence curve was shown to change dramatically when the system was confined in a low concentration silica aerogel .",
    "recent theoretical efforts have been aimed to understand the above mentioned behavior .",
    "these include mean  field type studies of the random field ising model@xcite , a liquid state approach using the ornstein ",
    "zernike equations@xcite and numerical simulations of a modified version of the blume  emery ",
    "griffiths model@xcite .",
    "a very successful approach was initiated by donley and liu@xcite . in this reference ,",
    "the authors introduce a free energy functional that takes into account the interactions that arise from the contact between the system molecules and the aerogel . by minimizing this free energy",
    "they obtain a coexistence curve which is in rough qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "moreover , the authors go beyond this mean field type approach by using a parametric form of the equation of state , combined with linear interpolation techniques .",
    "although this new approach yields better results than the previous mean field treatment , it is not conclusive since other parametric models may give different results .",
    "moreover , as the authors point out correctly , it is very important to study the role of the fluctuations .    in this paper",
    ", we go beyond the mean field approach and numerically determine the phase diagram of the model introduced in @xcite by using monte carlo methods . in this model ,",
    "one considers a scalar field @xmath6 and writes down a hamiltonian which includes bulk terms plus surface terms coming from the interaction with the aerogel : @xmath7 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\oint_{s } ds \\left [ -h_1 m({\\bf r } ) + \\frac \\g 2 m^2({\\bf r } ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bulk terms , the first volume integral , is the usual ginzburg  landau model for a scalar concentration field @xmath6 used in binary phase  transitions .",
    "the additional term given by the surface integral represents the superficial stress@xcite in the neighborhood of gel . here , the volume @xmath8 is the available volume for the fluid and the surface @xmath9 is the set of fluid points in contact with the gel .",
    "the parameters for this model are : @xmath10 , which is related to the temperature ; @xmath11 which sets the width of the coexistence curve ; the external field ( playing the role of the chemical potential ) @xmath12 ; the surface field @xmath13 ; and the surface enhancement parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we have performed monte ",
    "carlo simulations of the lattice version of the above hamiltonian in order to find its phase diagram .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions . in this lattice",
    ", we simulate the presence of the aerogel by considering that @xmath15 out of the @xmath16 lattice sites belong to a gel structure generated in a way to be explained in detail later .",
    "we call these sites  gel sites \" . in the remaining sites ( the  field sites \" )",
    "we consider the scalar variable @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) representing the fluid density field .",
    "the gradient term of eq.(1 ) is discretized in the usual way : @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for the set of right  nearest  neighbors sites to site @xmath21 . however , the presence of the gel has the effect that in this expression for the gradient : only those neighbor sites which are actually field sites contribute to the sum .",
    "accordingly , we introduce a set of indexes , @xmath22 defined to be equal to 1 , when the site @xmath23 is a field site , or 0 , when the site @xmath23 is a gel site .",
    "the gradient term becomes then : @xmath24 for the sake of clarity in notation we have ordered the @xmath25 field points such that , from @xmath2 to @xmath26 we have  pure bulk \" field sites ( i.e. those which are not in contact with the gel ) and from @xmath27 to @xmath25 we have @xmath28  surface \" field sites , ( i.e. those in contact with the gel , @xmath29 ) . with this convection in mind , the lattice version of the hamiltonian ( eq.(1 ) ) can be written as : @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i = n_b+1}^{n } \\left [ -h_1 m_i + g m_i^2 \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are parameters obtained by suitable rescaling of the continuum values @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the gel sites in this lattice form a periodic fractal structure generated by a diffusion  limited  cluster  aggregation ( dlca ) process@xcite , which mimics the aggregation process that form silica gels .",
    "the algorithm proceeds as follows@xcite :    let us consider the starting configuration of the gel as a collection of aggregates ( clusters ) containing one particle each , the total number of particles is @xmath15 . at a later time , one obtains a collection of @xmath36 aggregates , the @xmath21-th aggregate containing @xmath37 gel particles , so that @xmath38 the aggregates evolve in the following way : an aggregate @xmath21 is chosen at random according to a probability @xmath39 which depends on the number of particles @xmath37 that it contains , given by @xmath40 with @xmath41",
    ". then a space direction is chosen at random among the six possible directions and the cluster is moved by one lattice step in that direction ( we use periodic boundary conditions ) . if the cluster does not collide with any other cluster the algorithm continues by choosing again another cluster at random and moving it .",
    "if instead a collision occurs , the two colliding clusters merge into a new cluster formed by sticking together the colliding clusters .",
    "the process is repeated until a single cluster remains in the system .",
    "the resulting fractal dimension of the clusters is @xmath42 which is close to the expected value @xmath43 . in fig.([fig1 ] ) , we can see a picture of a fractal gel structure obtained using this dlca process .",
    "we use the average value of the field as the order parameter @xmath44 : @xmath45    where , for fixed gel structure , averages are performed with respect to the distribution @xmath46 . for a given gel structure representative configurations",
    "are obtained by the use of the monte ",
    "carlo method applied to the lattice hamiltonian ( [ hl ] ) .",
    "we have used the simple metropolis algorithm : a field value @xmath17 is proposed to change to a new value @xmath47 chosen randomly from a uniform distribution in @xmath48 for given @xmath49 .",
    "the new value @xmath47 is accepted with a probability given by @xmath50 $ ] , with @xmath51 is the change in the hamiltonian implied by the proposed change .",
    "the order parameter @xmath44 is computed as an average over different field configurations .",
    "an additional average has been performed with respect to 10 different gel structures .    to find the phase diagram , i.e. the dependence on the  temperature \" @xmath31 of the order parameter @xmath44 ,",
    "we take fixed values for the system parameters @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 , and vary the  temperature \" @xmath31 . for each value of the temperature",
    "@xmath31 we compute the hysteresis loop by using the monte  carlo method varying the external field @xmath33 from @xmath52 to @xmath53 and vice - versa .",
    "we first start at a sufficiently high value for @xmath54 ( see later ) and compute @xmath55 .",
    "next , by keeping the same final configuration for the density field , the external field is lowered by an amount @xmath56 to @xmath57 and compute the corresponding value for the order parameter @xmath58",
    ". then the field is changed to @xmath59 and so on until we arrive at @xmath53 .",
    "the process is reversed by increasing in a similar way the external field to reach again @xmath52 .    in order to determine accurately the hysteresis loop ,",
    "we do not take a constant value for @xmath60 but we take : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an additional scale control parameter .",
    "this means that we control the length along the hysteresis curve allowing us to have smooth hysteresis curves .",
    "two typical results for the hysteresis loops are shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) for the cases of no gel and a gel filling 4% of the lattice points . in the no  gel case ,",
    "the hysteresis loop is symmetrical around @xmath63 and one can read directly the equilibrium values for @xmath64 by taking the values at @xmath63 . when the gel is present , we determine the equilibrium values for @xmath44 by demanding that the gibbs free energy in the two phases is equal .",
    "the gibbs free energy can be obtained by integration of the general relation@xcite : @xmath65 by integrating along the upper curve of the hysteresis loop we obtain : @xmath66 whereas from the lower part of the hysteresis loop : @xmath67    the equilibrium values for @xmath44 are read from the hysteresis loop at the value of the external field @xmath33 such that @xmath68 . in order to compute those values for the free energy , according to ( [ gfe ] ) and ( [ gfei ] ) we need to know the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for this",
    ", we use a sufficiently large value for @xmath54 .",
    "for such a large external field , the mean field is a good approximation , in such a way that the gibbs free  energy can be replaced by just the internal energy @xmath71 .",
    "so we take @xmath72 .",
    "we have taken @xmath73 . in order to check the validity of mean field for this value of @xmath54",
    "we have compared the resulting average @xmath55 obtained in the simulation with the mean field value obtained from minimizing the hamiltonian @xmath71 for the same value for @xmath54 .",
    "both results agree within 1% .    in fig.([fig3 ] ) we plot the results of the numerical integrations ( [ gfe ] ) and ( [ gfei ] ) both for the no - gel case and for one gel configuration of porosity 96% for a value of the parameter @xmath74 . as expected , in the no gel case , @xmath75 and @xmath76 coincide for @xmath63 . in the gel case",
    ", we read from this curve the corresponding value for @xmath77 . using this value",
    ", we obtain from the upper and lower curves of the hysteresis loops , see fig.([fig2 ] ) , the corresponding values for @xmath44 .",
    "we have found that this method can be used efficiently far enough from the critical point . near the critical point ,",
    "the numerical errors produce a large uncertainty in the numerical integrations and it is difficult to accurately determine the required value of the external field . in those cases , we have taken simply an average of the lower and upper branches of the hysteresis loop as the values for @xmath44 . for temperatures above the critical one , there is no hysteresis loop .",
    "we present in this section the phase diagram as a function of the parameter @xmath31 for three different cases : ( i ) the no  gel situation , ( ii ) a gel case with a porosity of 88% and ( iii ) a gel case with a porosity of 96% .",
    "we use in all the cases a lattice with @xmath78 sites and the common hamiltonian parameter values @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for the factors controlling the step size for the variation of the external field we take @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the initial values for the hysteresis loop is @xmath73 . in the gel cases",
    ", we have taken averages with respect to 10 gel structures . by following the method described in the previous section ,",
    "we obtain for each temperature two values for the order parameter @xmath44 .",
    "these are plotted in fig.([fig4 ] ) and fig.([fig5 ] ) for a porosity of 88% and 96% , respectively . in these figures",
    ", we can see clearly the narrowing of the coexistence region when the gel is present . for smaller porosity ( larger fraction of the gel )",
    "the narrowing is more pronounced as observed in the experiments and in accordance with the results of mean field theory .",
    "although , as mentioned at the end of the previous section , numerical errors become large near the critical point , we conclude from the figures that the critical temperature is lowered when the gel is present .",
    "again , the reduction in the critical temperature is larger for smaller porosity .",
    "however , we note that in the simulations where the gel is present , we have found some steps in the lower curve of the hysteresis loop , as we can see for instance in fig.([fig2 ] ) , which could be interpreted as signaling a second transition . we have plotted in the phase diagram additional points corresponding to the steps in the hysteresis loops .",
    "the location of those points depends strongly on the particular realization of the dlca process to generate the fractal gel structure .",
    "this shows up in the large error bars for these points in the fig.([fig5 ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram obtained in this paper is qualitatively similar to that observed experimentally@xcite : the coexistence region in presence of gel is narrowed and shifted with respect to the non  gel situation .",
