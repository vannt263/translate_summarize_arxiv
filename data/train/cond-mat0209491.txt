    "the characteristic feature of ferroelectric nanomaterials ( e.g. the ceramics with nanosize grains or powder built by nanosize particles ) is known to be inhomogeneous polarization , dielectric susceptibility and other properties ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the properties inhomogeneity is related to the strong influence of the surface , where the properties differ from those in the bulk . because of this surface and correlation energy ( polarization gradient @xmath0 ) have to be included when calculating the nanomaterials properties . in phenomenological approach for ferroelectrics with perofskite structure",
    "the additional terms to free energy density have the form @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is polarization on the surface , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are material constants .",
    "the variation of free energy functional is usually performed to obtain equilibrium polarization .",
    "this leads to euler - lagrange equation for the polarization with boundary conditions , which include the extrapolation length @xmath4 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) as combined characteristic of surface energy and polarization gradient . moreover , the extrapolation length value reflects the degree of the polarization inhomogeneity .",
    "it is because the boundary condition has the form of tangent line to the polarization on the surface ( e.g. for spherical particle with radius @xmath6 the boundary condition is @xmath7 ) , so that the smaller homogeneity of polarization the larger the extrapolation length and vise versa . therefore it is important to calculate @xmath4 value rather than to consider it as phenomenological parameter .",
    "while parameter @xmath5 can be estimated via the material correlation radius nothing is known about @xmath4 value . on the other hand calculation of @xmath4 in ising model",
    "includes mainly the change of the average surface coordinate number ( see e.g. ref.@xcite , @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) that seems to be oversimplification for @xmath4 value estimation .",
    "another problem is related to contribution of depolarization field effect .",
    "the influence of this field that is able to destroy spontaneous polarization even in bulk materials can be decreased by such internal factors as free carriers and domain structure and it can be completely compensated under short circuit conditions .",
    "it was shown that inhomogeneous polarization in the ferroelectric films makes impossible to compensate the depolarization field in short circuited films made from single domain ferroelectric , that is perfect insulator @xcite .",
    "however in the majority of works the influence of depolarization field in nanomaterials has not been considered yet . in ref .",
    "@xcite the influence of depolarization field was considered in the model of the multidomain ferroelectric of finite size and space - charge layers on the surfaces .",
    "however the surface energy of the particles was not taken into account , which is known to play the decisive role in the physics of nanomaterials .",
    "the important role of the surface tension was demonstrated in @xcite , where observed size dependence of the phonon modes frequencies in nanocrystalline pbtio@xmath8 was shown to be attributed to the surface tension .    in the present work we propose the model for consideration of depolarization field effect .",
    "we present the surface energy via surface tension that made it possible to express the extrapolation length via surface tension coefficient .",
    "this coefficient has been shown to be dependent on temperature @xmath9 , that leads to extrapolation length dependence on @xmath10 and to appearance of some additional temperature dependence of the properties .",
    "the ferroelectric nanoparticles are supposed to be single domain ( e.g. polarization @xmath11 ) with space - charge layer on the surface .",
    "the solution of euler - lagrange equation for polarization both in paraelectric and ferroelectric phases has shown the possibility to obtain the nanomaterials properties from free energy expression in the form of power series of polarization like that in the bulk , but with renormalized coefficients .",
    "these coefficients depend on temperature and the particles sizes .",
    "although there is a distribution of these sizes in nanomaterials , so that the properties have to be averages with the sizes distribution function , we consider only the average radius @xmath6 of the particles . in many experimental works ( see e.g. ref.@xcite , @xcite ) the properties of nanomaterials were measured as a function of a particle average size .",
    "the average size can be determined from integrated width of diffraction peak using scherrer s formula or with the help of tem method .",
    "both results have been shown to be in a fairly good agreement with each other @xcite .",
    "surface energy is known to be the energy of surface tension on the boundary between two media ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it was included into thermodynamic potential written for ferroelectric nanomaterial in ref . @xcite both as a surface energy and as hydrostatic pressure , acting on nanoparticles .",
    "however these terms related to surface tension were not expressed via electric polarization ( order parameter of ferroelectrics ) , so that it appeared impossible to incorporate them directly into landau free energy that has the form of power series of polarization .",
    "this incorporation seems to be important to pour light on physical meaning of some parameters of thermodynamic theory approach to nanomaterial properties calculation .    in what follows",
    "we will amend this limitation of the previous consideration of surface tension contribution to the physical properties of nanomaterials .",
    "in general case the surface energy can be written in the form @xcite :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the surface tension coefficient and integration is performed over the surface .",
    "the small change of the surface area @xmath14 can be rewritten by the following way    @xmath15    here @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is a component of strain tensor , the normal to the surface is oriented along @xmath18 axis . keeping in mind that there is no inversion center near the material surface , the strain tensor component can be related to surface polarization @xmath19 via piezoelectric coefficients @xmath20 , namely @xmath21 .",
    "substitution of this relation into eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) yields :    @xmath22    note that eq . ( 3 ) can be used directly for ferroelectric thin films also .",
    "contrary to the films in nanomaterials there is another contribution from surface tension related to the uniform mechanical pressure @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the main curvature radiuses of the particle surface ( @xmath26 for the films ) . for ferroelectrics without inversion center",
    "this pressure induces polarization via piezoelectric coupling . for ferroelectrics with inversion center ( e.g. ferroelectrics with perofskite structure ) the contribution of the pressure",
    "can be expressed via electrostriction and included into free energy on the base of the procedure proposed in @xcite .",
    "therefore free energy ( with determined stress @xmath27 , expressed in terms of uniform pressure @xmath28 , polarization @xmath29 and strain @xmath30 as independent variables ) acquires the form : @xmath31 + e_{surf }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is ferroelectric transition temperature in a bulk material , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively electrostriction and elastic coefficients in voigt presentation , @xmath35 is the electric field . for spherical particles @xmath36 . when taking into account the particle spherical symmetry , we assume that the magnitude of oriented along @xmath18 axis polarization @xmath37 depends only upon the radial position @xmath38 .",
    "analogically to @xcite and taking into account the depolarization field energy , one can obtain the renormalized free energy in the form    @xmath39 + 8\\pi \\int \\mu d^{2}p^{2}rdr   \\eqnum{4b } \\\\",

    "hereinafter we will consider ferroelectrics with perofskite structure and nanoparticles of spherical form so we will use the eq . ( 4b ) .",
    "let us proceed to the consideration of surface tension coefficient temperature dependence related to phase transition from paraelectric to ferroelectric phase .",
    "critical temperature dependence of surface tension coefficient when approaching the transition from solid state to liquid state is well known @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "nobody considered influence of structural phase transition like paraelectric - ferroelectric on surface tension .",
    "we carried out the calculations in the following model .    in the solids",
    "the appearance of polarization manifests itself via the charges on the surface . in nanomaterials and in the films",
    "the charges can appear in some region near the surface where polarization is essentially inhomogeneous .",
    "it is known that these charges cause the depolarization field in ferroelectrics . in the considered case of single domain",
    "nanoparticles the only possibility of depolarization field compensation is the space - charge layer on the surface that has to include the charges of opposite sign to those related to polarization .",
    "the possible sources of space - charge layer including free carriers ( if any ) localized near the surface one can find in ref .",
    "the influence of the flat surface on the aforementioned charges @xmath43 can be considered by means of the interaction with image charges @xmath44 ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively the dielectric permittivity of the material of particle and surrounding media .",
    "all these charges cause the additional energy @xmath47 related to the surface @xcite , so that    @xmath48    here @xmath49 is the concentration of the charges related to inhomogeneous spontaneous polarization ( i.e. it is non - zero only in ferroelectric phase ) , the integration is performed over the volume of particle . taking into account coulomb interaction between the dipole with moment @xmath50 and its image ,",
    "one obtains the following expression    @xmath51    here @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively a lattice constant , minimal distance between positive and negative charges and the size of the region of inhomogeneous polarization .",
    "integration in eq .",
    "( 5 ) yields    @xmath55    this relation can be simplified in supposition @xmath56 , so that    @xmath57    it should be noted that the consideration we just have carried out can be applied both for flat surface and for the surfaces with the principal radii of curvature much larger than @xmath53 value .",
    "this statement follows from the derivation of @xmath58 for the case if spherical particle performed in appendix1 .",
    "it should be underlined that since for spherical particles @xmath59 the temperature dependence ( see below ) is the same for all the considered forms .",
    "moreover since approximately @xmath60 , it is possible to say that the expressions ( 6a ) and ( a1 - 6 ) coincide with each other .",
    "more generally it would be better to rewrite _  _",
    "@xmath61  in the following form _ : _",
    "@xmath62 where the value of the coefficient @xmath63 depends on particle shape , its value being @xmath64 .",
    "the surface tension coefficient in ferroelectric phase can represented as the sum of @xmath58 and that of paraelectric phase @xmath65 , i.e.    @xmath66    one can see , that while @xmath67 is temperature independent , @xmath68 depends on temperature mainly via @xmath69 . really in the considered cases of nanomaterials in the form of nanopowders or nanocrystalline ceramics the media surrounding nanoparticles",
    "may be considered as non - ferroelectric one .",
    "in such a case at phase transition temperature @xmath70 and so @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( see ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) ) .",
    "note , that in the case of two ferroelectric media ( e.g. batio@xmath8 particles dispersed in srtio@xmath8 or pbzr@xmath73ti@xmath74o@xmath8 media ) both @xmath75 and @xmath76 depend on @xmath10 .",

    "it is necessary to add the inequality @xmath81 to eq.(7 ) .",
    "hereinafter we consider only the case of nonferroelectric surrounding media .",
    "we will consider this effect in the model described in previous section .",
    "namely the charges localized in the thin surface layer , where polarization is the most inhomogeneous , create depolarization field inside the particle . this field can be compensated by space - charge layer on the surface ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the magnitude of depolarization field was calculated on the base of equation written in ref .",
    "@xcite for homogeneously polarized dielectric submerged in a medium with dielectric susceptibility @xmath82 . to take into account additional charges related to inhomogeneous polarization and those from space - charge layer we added the term @xmath83 . in the case of external field absence",

    "the @xmath92 will be considered as variational parameter to minimize the energy related to depolarization field .    with respect to eq .",

( 11 ) makes it possible to calculate the depolarization field for nanoparticles of different form for which depolarization factors @xmath86 are known .",
