    "the relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide an opportunity in laboratory to investigate qcd matter under extreme conditions of high temperature , high density , and strong electromagnetic field .",
    "data taken in experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite indicate the transient existence of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which then undergoes phase transitions and gradually merges into large number of hadrons .",
    "we are interested in the dynamical process of the phase transition , which is essentially needed , in order to have a complete physical picture of relativistic heavy - ion collisions and to understand phenomena found at rhic and lhc .",
    "in particular , the dynamical description of the phase transition could determine the contribution of gluons in the buildup of the collective flow of hadrons , which has not been intensively studied so far .",
    "in quark coalescence models @xcite , which have been employed to explain the quark number scaling behavior in the hadronic elliptic flows found at rhic @xcite , gluons are not explicitly considered .",
    "another motivation concerns the viscous effect during the phase transition . in viscous hydrodynamical calculations @xcite the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio ( @xmath0 ) of the parton - hadron mixture during the phase transition",
    "is set to be constant .",
    "however , this treatment is only an assumption , since there is no evidence for the equal @xmath0 of partons and hadrons at the phase transition .",
    "the dynamical description of the phase transition would determine the real viscous corrections to the thermal distribution functions of each hadron species @xcite and would examine the applicability of the cooper - frye prescription @xcite used in viscous hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "since the dynamical description for the phase transition from first principle is at present an unsolved problem , we have to content ourselves with modeling , which allows exploring related phenomena in an articulated way . in this article",
    "we will introduce a dynamical scheme for the confinement phase transition of first - order .",
    "the purpose of this article is conceptional .",
    "we consider , for simplicity , the transition from gluons to pions . here",
    "we do not discuss the transition from gluons to glueballs @xcite , which is a sharp first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "we _ assume _ that the hadronization from gluons to pions is a first - order phase transition .",
    "although this contradicts the fact that the qcd transition at zero baryon chemical potential is a crossover @xcite , the condition of phase equilibrium that keeps the temperature and chemical potential of gluonic and pionic phase equal and constant during the first - order phase transition will prove numerical implementations .",
    "simulating the crossover phase transition needs the correct implementation of the equation of state ( eos ) from the lattice qcd calculations and is a future project .",
    "the present work can be seen as an attempt to describe a first - order phase transition between two phases with different degrees of freedom .",
    "it is the first step towards a full scheme describing the first - order phase transition from quarks and gluons to mesons and baryons at a finite baryonic chemical potential .",
    "adding quarks and more hadron species into the scheme is more complicated , but in line with the present implementation , and will be shown in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the to be introduced numerical implementation of hadronization is a further extension of the existing parton cascade bamps ( boltzmann approach of multi parton scatterings ) @xcite , which describes the pre - equilibrium stage , the thermalization , and the hydrodynamical evolution of quarks and gluons produced in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the dynamical hadronization scheme will serve as an interface between bamps and hadronic transport model , which will be developed in the next .",
    "bamps is a numerical solver of the kinetic boltzmann equations for on - shell quarks and gluons by using test particles to represent phase space distribution functions of quarks and gluons .",
    "interactions of quarks and gluons are simulated by the stochastic interpretation of the transition rates of scattering processes .",
    "the numerical implementation of transitions from gluons to pions , which will be presented in this article , has the same means as used in bamps for interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "we will show that the effective probabilities of the microscopic processes for transitions from gluons to pions are entirely determined by the thermodynamical feature of the phase transition , the viscosity of the qcd matter and the velocity profile of the hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "our numerical implementation is different from the hadronization procedures used in transport models such as ampt @xcite , phsd @xcite , etc ..    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2:theory ] we derive the volume change of gluons and pions during the phase transition , based on the conditions of phase equilibrium at the first - order phase transition and hydrodynamical equations . with this",

    "we derive the time dependence of @xmath33 in a local region under the gibbs condition ( [ gibbs ] ) . in our dynamical scheme gluons hadronize smoothly into pions",
    ". we do not consider spinodal instabilities @xcite , which lead to fluctuations in the baryon density @xcite for instance .",
    "it would be possible to introduce spinodal instabilities when adding quarks and baryons in our scheme and incorporating the mean field into vlasov term of the boltzmann equation .    during a time step @xmath34",

    "thus , the temperature decreases too .    in order to hold the gibbs condition ( [ gibbs ] ) during the phase transition",
    ", there must be energy influxes into the gluonic and pionic phase , which compensate the energy loss of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the gluonic and pionic phase , respectively .",

    "equation ( [ dvg ] ) is indeed an important result , which shows quantitatively how the transition between gluons and pions proceeds and is a basic equation for establishing a microscopic transport scheme for the first - order phase transition .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ dvg ] ) has been derived for a transition from gluons to pions in an expanding volume element , it is also valid for a transition from pions to gluons in a contracting volume element , where @xmath62 and @xmath68 are negative . in this case",

    "the energy balance in eq .",
    "( [ energy2 ] ) can be reinterpreted that the sum of the energy from the transition @xmath69 and that from the surrounding medium @xmath70 and @xmath71 is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy of newly produced gluons @xmath72 and the released latent heat @xmath73 .    from eq .",
    "( [ dvg ] ) we see the viscous effect on the phase transition . for a perfect fluid , where @xmath74",

( [ shearpressure ] ) ] .",
    "the different behavior of @xmath75 in transitions from gluons to pions and backwards is due to the fact that the process of the phase transition with non - zero viscosity is irreversible .",
    "moreover , in an expanding system @xmath77 could be negative for large @xmath78 , so that @xmath38 would become positive , which can not describe the phase transition from gluons to pions , where @xmath38 should be negative .",
    "this indicates that for large dissipation the first - order phase transition can not occur .",
    "quantitative statements about an upper limit of the shear viscosity will be made elsewhere .",
    "we mention that it seems that there is no such upper limit of the shear viscosity for the phase transition from pions to gluons in a contracting system , since @xmath76 is positive .",
    "finally , a non - zero shear viscosity will increase the total entropy during the phase transition .",
    "this important feature will be realized in the to be introduced dynamical scheme of hadronization .",
    "before we proceed , the entropy density is given by @xmath79 where @xmath12 stands for @xmath13 or @xmath14 . during the phase transition",
    "the total entropy density is @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the entropy density of gluons and pions at the transition temperature @xmath29 .",
    "in the rest of the article we consider only the phase transition from gluons to pions in expanding systems .    using eq .",
    "( [ dvg ] ) we find that the difference between the number of gained pions and the number of lost gluons in the volume element @xmath19 during @xmath34 is @xmath83 which is nonnegative , since @xmath84 from eq .",
    "( [ shearpressure ] ) .",
    "this indicates that for an ideal fluid the number of gained pions is the same as that of lost gluons , while for a viscous fluid the number of gained pions is larger than that of lost gluons , which increases the total entropy .",
    "therefore , we need number changing processes such as two gluons go to three pions , @xmath85 , to implement hadronization in a viscous fluid",
    ". we will see later that a part of the latent heat provides an additional energy to the three pions , so that the temperature and chemical potential of pions keep constant .    for the phase transition from gluons to pions",
    "we consider the following processes : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and back reactions @xmath88 and @xmath89 . here",
    "we hide the charge of pions , which could be noted explicitly as @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the probabilities of the occurrence of these processes could be tuned to obtain the same yield of all kind of pions .",
    "we have to note that the consideration of these microscopic processes is not from the first principle , but is necessary to realize the macroscopic volume change according to eq .",
    "( [ dvg ] ) and to maintain the gibbs condition ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "therefore , in principle one could consider more other processes .",
    "the processes we have considered are the simplest one can think of .",
    "when gluons hadronize into pions in the process @xmath86 and @xmath87 , besides the total kinetic energy of gluons , an amount of energy from the bag pressure ( latent heat ) , will be involved in the total energy of pions .",
    "therefore , the average energy of each produced pion is larger than that of the lost gluons , which is @xmath94 .",
    "we denote the ratio of the total energy of the final pions over the total kinetic energy of the initial gluons by @xmath95 , which is larger than @xmath96 .",
    "we will show later that the determination of the ratio @xmath95 , see eq .",
    "( [ px ] ) , corresponds to the latent heat , see eq .",
    "( [ condx ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the total kinetic energy is not conserved in the processes @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "since transitions with momentum and kinetic energy conservation have been numerically implemented in a standard routine , we amplify the momentum ( also the kinetic energy ) of each gluon by @xmath95 before performing the transitions to pions by using the standard routine .",
    "one can easily prove that the factor @xmath95 is lorentz invariant .    since the latent heat has been involved in @xmath86 and @xmath87 according to eq .",
    "( [ condx ] ) , in back reactions @xmath97 and @xmath89 the total momentum as well as the total kinetic energy are conserved .",
    "we allow only those back reactions to occur , if pions are newly produced from @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , on average , each gluon coming from back reactions has a larger energy than @xmath94 .",
    "this mimics the energy transfer from the pionic phase to the gluonic phase , in order to compensate the energy loss of gluons due to the hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "we involve back reactions in processes @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , where three pions or two pions are regarded as intermediate states , and @xmath101 denotes outgoing gluons with a higher averaged energy than that of initial gluons .",
    "numerically we implement @xmath102 and @xmath103 directly and do not specify intermediate states explicitly .",
    "now we derive the probability that a process @xmath86 , @xmath104 , @xmath103 , or @xmath102 occurs , denoted by @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , respectively . for simplicity , these probabilities are assumed to be independent on the momenta of particles involved in the processes .",
    "therefore , the number of lost gluons and gained pions in volume @xmath19 during @xmath34 relate to the probabilities @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 as follows : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the gluon number in volume @xmath19 .",

    "<S> we present a dynamical scheme for hadronization with first - order confinement phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamical conditions of phase equilibrium , the fluid velocity profile and the dissipative effect determine the macroscopic changes of the parton volume and the corresponding hadron volume during the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic volume changes are the basis for building up a dynamical scheme by considering microscopic transition processes from partons to hadrons and backwards . </S>",
    "<S> the established scheme is proved by comparing the numerical results with the analytical solutions in the case of a one dimensional expansion with bjorken boost invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons show almost perfect agreements , which demonstrates the applicability of the introduced scheme . </S>"
