    "the idea of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) was originally introduced for a uniform , non - interacting gas of elementary bosons . in reality ,",
    "bec experiments are conducted using potential traps for gases of bosonic particles , like alkali atoms , atomic hydrogen or metastable helium , that are composite particles made of fermions , and for which inter - particle interactions can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "alternative bec scenarios also take into account composite systems , e.g. , condensation of fermionic pairs in liquid @xmath0he @xcite or excitons ( electron - hole pairs ) in bulk semiconductors @xcite . in addition , these bec scenarios are closely related to other macroscopic quantum phenomena like superfluidity and superconductivity @xcite .    in many studies the internal structure of composite particles is neglected . on the other hand , it was noted that in some cases this structure plays an important role @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see how bec can be affected by the internal structure of composite bosonic particles .    in this work",
    "we consider a simple model of bec with composite bosonic particles .",
    "in particular , we assume that neither the composite particles nor their constituents interact , such that the internal structure of composite particles is stable and temperature independent .    of course , the bound states between constituent particles have to result from their interaction .",
    "however , here we assume that once the constituents form a composite particle state , they do not interact anymore .",
    "physically , this may correspond to a dilute gas of composite particles for which energy scales of a binding interaction potential between constituents are much greater than energy scales of the confining trap . as an example",
    ", one may think of an atomic hydrogen gas in which ionization temperature is much higher than the standard temperatures required to obtain bec .",
    "such a simplified model allows us to focus on the fundamental problem of how bec depends on the internal state of composite particles , while neglecting other physical properties .    nowadays",
    ", the phenomenology of composite bosons such as excitons , can be explained using the tools developed by quantum information theory .",
    "the role of quantum correlations between constituents forming a bound composite particle state can be studied qualitatively and quantitatively using the notion of entanglement . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the amount of entanglement between a pair of fermions ( bosons ) is responsible for their behavior as a single bosonic particle , i.e. , only entangled particles behave like a single boson and the more entanglement between them , the more ( less ) bosonic they are @xcite . here , we raise the question : how is bec affected by the entanglement between the two constituent fermions or bosons ?",
    "before we start our discussion , let us recall the important results that are relevant to this work .",
    "imagine a pair of distinguishable fermionic or bosonic particles .",
    "the system is described by the creation operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the indices @xmath3 label different modes that can be occupied by the two particles .",
    "these modes can for example correspond to different energies , or different momentum states .",
    "the wave function of the system is of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the probability amplitude that particle @xmath6 is in mode @xmath7 and particle @xmath8 is in mode @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the vacuum state . using insights from entanglement theory , the mathematical procedure known as the schmidt decomposition allows us to rewrite the above state as @xcite @xmath11 where the modes labeled by @xmath12 are superpositions of the previous modes @xmath7 and @xmath9 and @xmath13 are probability amplitudes that both particles occupy mode @xmath12 . note that despite the fact that @xmath14 and @xmath15 share the same label , physically these modes might be totally different .",
    "what is important is that , the modes labeled by @xmath12 give rise to the internal structure of a composite particle .",
    "we have introduced a composite boson creation operator @xmath16 , that creates a pair of particles .",
    "note that this operator resembles the one for cooper pairs .",
    "the entanglement between particles is encoded in the amplitudes @xmath13 . in particular",
    ", one can introduce a measure of entanglement known as _ purity _",
    "@xmath17 for @xmath18 the particles are disentangled , whereas in the limit @xmath19 the entanglement between particles goes to infinity .",
    "the amount of entanglement can be also expressed via the so called schmidt number @xmath20 . intuitively , @xmath21 estimates the average number of modes that are taken into account in the internal structure of a composite boson .",
    "the bosonic properties of @xmath16 can be studied in many ways .",
    "for example , the commutation relation gives @xmath22=1+\\xi \\sum\\lambda_m(\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_m\\hat{a}_m+\\hat{b}^{\\dag}_m\\hat{b}_m)$ ] , where @xmath23 if @xmath6 and @xmath8 are fermions , or @xmath24 if they are bosons . on the other hand , following the approach in @xcite one may study the ladder properties of this operator @xmath25 where @xmath26 are states of @xmath27 composite bosons , parameters @xmath28 are normalization factors , such that @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are unnormalized states that can result form subtracting a single composite particle from a state @xmath26 . the states @xmath30 do not correspond to @xmath31 composite bosons of the same type , but rather to a complicated state of @xmath31 pairs of particles @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "the ladder structure of operators @xmath16 and @xmath32 starts to approach those of ideal bosons if @xmath33 for all @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that for a pair of fermions the ratio @xmath34 can be bounded from above and below by the function of entanglement @xmath35 this result shows that in the limit of large entanglement ( @xmath36 ) the pairs of particles behave like real bosons .",
    "other results on the relation between composite bosons and quantum correlations can be found in @xcite .    assuming that composite bosons are in a thermal state , here we can describe the composite bosons with a gaussian state which contains coherent , thermal , and squeezed ones .",
    "thus , the gaussian formula of the composite bosons is represented by the following modified operator that is based on the one studied in @xcite @xmath37 where the double indices refer to internal ( @xmath12 ) and to external degrees of freedom ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the internal index @xmath12 represents their position values when the proton and electron are strongly correlated @xcite . in our case",
    "@xmath38 labels the energy levels of the trap in which the bec takes place",
    ". moreover , as we assumed in the beginning , the internal structure parameters @xmath39 ( for @xmath40 ) are independent of @xmath38 .",
    "the above operator has desirable properties , since it is possible to analytically evaluate the factors @xmath28 and one can control the entanglement between constituents @xmath6 and @xmath8 via the parameter @xmath41 @xcite . for @xmath42",
    "the system is separable and in the limit @xmath43 entanglement goes to infinity .",
    "in addition @xmath44 for a pair of fermions and @xmath45 for a pair of bosons .",
    "finally , the average schmidt number is @xmath46    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the bec of composite bosons made of fermionic pairs .",
    "we consider two cases , a potential trap with only two levels and the 3d harmonic potential trap with an infinite number of energy states .",
    "next , we repeat the same for the composite bosons made of bosonic pairs . finally , we analyze our results in the last section .",
    "we consider indistinguishable cobosons in a two - level system and in a multi - level system , where each coboson is comprised of two fermions ( bi - fermion ) .",
    "we investigate the case in which indistinguishable cobosons are in a gaussian state , such that the normalization ratio of the coboson operator is represented by the parameter @xmath41 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( 8) , @xmath41 represents the degree of entanglement between a pair of fermions , where @xmath42 ( @xmath47 ) means that a pair of fermions are separable ( maximally entangled ) .",
    "first we consider a two - level system with a fixed number of @xmath48 cobosons , see fig .",
    "1 ( a ) . although the fraction of cobosons in the ground state can not exhibit a bec phase transition , it is still interesting to compare its thermal behaviour with respect to a two - level system occupied by @xmath48 cobosons .",
    "the thermal state of this system reads @xmath49 where the total number of cobosons is @xmath48 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is a normalization constant @xcite . @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the energy levels .",
    "to evaluate the condensate fraction @xmath56 for a finite number @xmath48 , we need to know how to describe the mean occupation number with energy @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "we derive the mean occupation number in the ground state as @xmath58\\\\ & & = \\frac{1}{z}\\sum^n_{n=0}e^{-\\beta n(e_0-\\mu)}e^{-\\beta ( n - n)(e_1-\\mu)}[1+(n-1)\\frac{\\chi_{n+1}}{\\chi_{n}}].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] putting @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the eq .",

    "2 ( c ) the amount of entanglement between the constituents fermions is relatively small and we expect to see a significant deviation from pure bosonic behaviour . indeed",
    ", the condensate fraction never exceeds @xmath66 when @xmath70 , which is a result of the pauli exclusion principle",

    "figure 3 shows the condensate fraction for @xmath77 and a large amount of entanglement . for both two- and multi - level systems ( discussed in the next section of the paper ) the coboson bec behaves like an ideal bosonic system .",
    "let us now consider a more realistic physical system consisting of cobosons distributed over the infinitely many energy levels of a 3d isotropic harmonic trap , see fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "we fix the average number of cobosons to be @xmath78 and describe the system via a grand canonical ensemble with a chemical potential @xmath79 . in this paper",
    "we do not take the proper thermodynamical limit ( such a limit can not be attained in real experiments ) and thus we can not observe a genuine bec phase transition .",
