    "disordered systems form one of the centerstages of studies in many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "reasons include the fact that imperfection and impurities come naturally in several physical systems including ultracold atoms , nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamonds , solid - state systems , and ion traps .",
    "moreover , such systems exhibit exotic quantum phases and phenomena like anderson localization @xcite and bose glass @xcite . as a further example , during crystallization processes , atoms or molecules form solid structures by arranging themselves in a way so that the total energy of the system gets minimized , but thermal motion of the molecules , chemical impurities , or pressure differences , often lead to defects in their arrangements . as a consequence",
    ", ideal mechanical , chemical , electronic , magnetic , or optical properties of the sample are expected to alter .",
    "advances in experimental techniques have also made it possible to artificially realize disordered systems in different physical substrates  @xcite .",
    "defects , in general , reduce the physical properties like magnetization , conductivity , classical correlation , and quantum correlation @xcite of the system  @xcite . thereby the system may loose its ability of performing in a better way than its classical counterpart . it has been reported that disorder reduces the fidelity of quantum state transmission as well as of quantum gate implementation  @xcite .    however , thermal fluctuation or impurities in the system , may lead to a counterintuitive enhancement of physical properties , known as `` disorder - induced order '' or `` order - from - disorder '' .",
    "in particular , observables like magnetization and classical correlations have been shown to increase in the presence of disorder in many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations , in general , are believed to be fragile quantities and can decay very fast in presence of impurities .",
    "intuitively therefore , one expects that randomness , in general , will wipe out quantum correlations from the system .",
    "however , there are several examples for which this intution fails @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics places strict restrictions in the form of `` no - go theorems '' , like no - cloning  @xcite and monogamy of quantum correlations  @xcite , on information processing tasks ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper , we concentrate on two restrictions imposed by the quantum mechanical principles  monogamy of bell inequality violation  @xcite and exclusion principle of classical information transmission  @xcite . in a multipartite scenario , with a boss and several subordinates , the laws slate that if the shared quantum state between the boss and a single subordinate exhibits quantumness , either by violating bell inequality or by being dense codeable , then the other channels between the boss and the subordinates are prohibited from possessing the same quantum advantage , and hence , enforces limitations upon the quantum information processing tasks possible in that scenario .",
    "it is easy to see therefrom that the two - qubit states obtained from translationally invariant systems , which include the ground states of one - dimensional translation - invariant quantum spin models ( without disorder ) , neither violate bell inequality and nor have quantum advantage in dense coding @xcite .",
    "the two - pronged restriction imposed by monogamy and translation invariance causes _ all _ two - qubit states of such multiparty systems to be devoid of the quantum advantages .",
    "the same arguments are true for an arbitrary isotropic higher - dimensional lattice .",
    "we now ask the following question : is it possible to regain the quantum advantages in these two - qubit states in some physical many - body system , while still retaining the translation invariance of the system , at least at the level of observables under study , i.e. at the level of the amount of bell - inequality violation and the capacity of dense coding ?",
    "we answer the question in the affirmative by using quenched disordered spin systems .",
    "we consider quenched disordered one - dimensional quantum spin-1/2 systems .",
    "we show that even though translation symmetry is present in these systems after quenched averaging , such disordered models can overcome the hurdle of bell monogamy and exclusion principle of dense coding .",
    "first , we show that in the disordered quantum @xmath0 spin glass and in the random field quantum @xmath0 model , the quenched averaged quantities for the amount of bell inequality violation as well as the capacity of dense coding , of the nearest - neighbor zero - temperature state can attain nonclassical values and thereby overcome the monogamy constraints , despite the fact that the post - quenched averaged quantities are translation - invariant .",
    "the analysis is carried out by applying the jordan - wigner transformation to the disordered @xmath0 models  @xcite .",
    "the phenomena observed them is potentially generic , in that we have also demonstrated in models which do not lend themselves to an analytical treatments .",
    "precisely , we extend the analysis and demonstrate the phenomena for quenched disordered quantum heisenberg spin glasses , for which the investigation is performed via the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique . finally , we carry out the finite - size scaling analyses for both the quenched observables in all the models considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : monogamy ] , we review the monogamy of bell inequality violation and the exclusion principle of dense coding . the results are presented in secs .  [",
    "sec : xy ] and  [ sec : xyz ] .",
    "[ sec : xy ] introduces the disordered @xmath0 spin models and briefly discusses the methodology , following which it presents the results which show how quantum systems , possessing imperfections , lead to clear advantages over the corresponding clean systems .",
    "the results for the quenched disordered heisenberg spin glass are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : xyz ] . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "it is known from the celebrated bell theorem @xcite that the violation of the bell inequality by a two - party state guarantees that the state can not have a local realist description .",
    "given any two - qubit state , @xmath1 , violation of the bell - chsh  @xcite inequality demands @xmath2 let us define @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the elements of the corresponding correlation matrix , @xmath5 .",
    "it can be shown that after maximization over the local measurements , we have @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the two largest or the largest and the second - largest eigenvalues of @xmath10 . in order to violate the bell - chsh inequality , one therefore requires @xmath11 in case of multipartite states , _ if the quantum state shared by any two subparts of a multiparty system leads to a bell inequality violation , then it precludes its violation for the states which the subparts share with the other parts of the total system .",
    "_ this is referred to as monogamy for bell inequality violation for the multiparty quantum states  @xcite .",
    "we define a quantity @xmath12 , which quantifies the amount of bell inequality violation for the two - qubit states , and in the following sections , we will investigate its behavior while exploring different physical many - body systems .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum dense coding protocol incorporates a sender - receiver scheme for communicating classical information over a quantum channel .",
    "if we consider that our conventional sender , alice , and receiver , bob , initially share a state @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the dimensions of the hilbert space corresponding to alice s and bob s parts respectively , then the dense coding capacity turns out to be  @xcite @xmath16 bits .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is referred to as the `` quantum advantage '' of dense coding of the state @xmath13 over the classical channel @xcite .",
    "this is justified by the fact that @xmath18 bits of classical information can be transmitted by sending a @xmath14-dimensional quantum system .",
    "a bipartite quantum state is said to be dense codeable if it has a positive quantum advantage of dense coding . in a multipartite scenario ,",
    "the  exclusion principle \" for quantum dense coding demands that _ if any two subsystem of a multiparty quantum system shares a dense codeable state , then they ca nt share any such quantum state efficient for dense coding , simultaneously , with other parts of the system_.    let us illustrate the above no - go theorems for a three - party state .",
    "when a tripartite state @xmath19 is shared between a , b , and c , monogamy of bell inequality violation and exclusion principle implies that if the reduced state @xmath13 violates local realism or has quantum advantage in dense coding , i.e. if @xmath20 or @xmath21 is positive , then the reduced state at ac will have @xmath22 or @xmath23 respectively .",
    "in this section , we consider the disordered quantum @xmath0 models for testing the monogamy of bell violation and the exclusion principle for dense coding capacity .",
    "we begin by briefly discussing the idea of quenched averaging in the following subsection .      in the present work , for all purposes ,",
    "the type of disorder that has been used is  quenched \" .",
    "spin glass states are those which emerge due to the presence of such type of disorder in the system and the term `` glass '' comes from the analogy with the chemical glass which is formed by quenching a liquid .",
    "the term  quenched \" signifies that the time over which the dynamics of the system takes place is much smaller than the time scale over which there is a change in a particular realization of parameters governing the disorder in the system .",
    "this leads to the fact that while calculating the quenched averaged value of a physical quantity , we need to perform the averaging of several expectation values of that quantity , each of which is obtained for a fixed configuration , over the relevant probability distribution of the configurations .",
    "the hamiltonian for the one - dimensional disordered quantum @xmath0 spin chain in a random transverse field is given by @xmath24 , \\label{eqn : xy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the coupling strength between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 site , @xmath28 represents the field strength at the @xmath26 site , and @xmath29 is the anisotropy constant .",
    "@xmath30 is a constant and has the unit of energy , while @xmath31 and @xmath29 are dimensionless . here ,",
    "@xmath32 for @xmath33 correspond to the pauli spin matrices . for the ordered system , all the @xmath34 and @xmath35 are separately equal , and",
    "are denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "here we have assumed cyclic boundary condition , so that the @xmath38 and the @xmath39 sites are equivalent .",
    "the ordered model is exactly solvable via successive use of the jordan - wigner , fourier , and bogoliubov transformations  @xcite , while the disordered model is not .",
    "however , the same procedure can again lead us to the one- and two - site reduced density matrices for the disorder case . for completeness",
    ", we briefly review the mechanism here .",
    "first , we map the pauli spin operators to the spinless fermions via the jordan - wigner transformation , so that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xy ] ) becomes @xmath40 , \\label{eqn : xyab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are symmetric and antisymmetric real @xmath43 matrices , respectively , and are given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the cyclic boundary condition .",
    "here , the @xmath47 are spinless fermionic operators obtained via the jordan - wigner transformation . defining @xmath48 via the eigen - equation @xmath49 with eigenvalue @xmath50 and obtaining the corresponding @xmath51 from the equation @xmath52",
    "we can calculate the correlation matrix @xmath53 , defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) being the @xmath59th element of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "finally , one can show that the magnetizations and and two - point correlation functions of the zero - temperature state can be easily obtained from the correlation matrix @xmath53 .",
    "we get @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the diagonal correlations are given by @xmath64 while all off - diagonal correlations vanish .",
    "the one- and the two - site density matrices can now be easily constructed from the one- and two - point correlation functions and consequently , the bell inequality violation ( eq .  ( [ eqn : mrho ] ) ) and the dense coding capacity ( eq .  ( [ eqn : dense ] ) ) can be computed .",
    "let us now consider the quantum @xmath0 model of @xmath65 spins interacting via site - dependent nearest neighbour exchange interactions , @xmath34 , which are identically and independently distributed @xmath66 with gaussian probability distribution , while the field strength , @xmath35 , at each lattice site is kept constant .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian follows from eq .",

    "similarly , the exclusion principle for dense coding implies that the maximum achievable dense coding capacity for a quantum state shared between any two - party state of the @xmath65-party system , is restricted to the classical dense coding capacity , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the dimension of the hilbert space corresponding to the sender , and hence no quantum advantage is possible in any two - party reduced state .",
    "these are consequences of the monogamy relations mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : monogamy ] , as applied to the case of the ordered chain .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath13 be a two - party state reduced from the zero - temperature state in the ordered case . here",
    "a and b are disjoint collections of lattice sites of the one - dimensional chain .",
    "the translation invariance of the ordered chain ( with periodic boundary condition for finite @xmath65 ) implies that we can always find a collection c of lattices that is disjoint from both a and b such that the reduced states @xmath13 and @xmath74 of the zero - temperature state are equal .",
    "the subtle assumption here is that the chain is sufficiently large , so that c does not overlap with a or b ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    "if @xmath13 is a nearest - neighbor ( two - site ) density matrix , we only need @xmath75 .",
    "applying now the monogamy relations to the state @xmath19 , we obtain the stated results for the ordered case in the translational invariant scenario .",
    "while we have considered only the one - dimensional case explicitly in this paper , the same arguments hold for any isotropic higher - dimensional lattices .    for the spin glass system ,",
    "the above line of argument can not be applied .",
    "the zero - temperature properties of the system are physically relevant only after quenched averaging has been performed , and post - quenching , these properties are again translationally invariant , just like for the ordered case . and",
    "so @xmath76 for any physical property , @xmath77 , for the reduced states at ab and bc . note that throughout this paper , we associate the subscript @xmath78 to a quantity , if it is quenched averaged .",
    "the @xmath79 and @xmath80 , however , do not correspond to a single state of abc , and so the monogamy argument of the ordered case do not carry over to the disordered ones .",

    "moreover , we observe that quenched bell inequality violation and advantage in dense coding capacity after quenching , increase with the introduction of the @xmath138-interaction , i.e. with the introduction of @xmath128 .",
    "we specifically choose @xmath139 , where the bell inequality violation and the dense coding capacity reach their respective maximum , to illustrate the finite - size scalings ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling1 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath99 and @xmath100 decay as @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "in this work , we have considered quenched disordered spin chains for investigating the monogamy of bell inequality violation and the exclusion principle in dense coding of the three - spin nearest neighbor clusters of the corresponding zero - temperature states .",
    "in particular , we focus on the zero - temperature states of the random @xmath0 spin models and the random heisenberg spin glass .",
    "our analysis reveals that although the monogamy of quantum correlations and the translational invariance of the hamiltonian in clean system force the considered quantum characteristics to attain at most classical values  leading to no - go theorems  the quantum nature can be resurrected by the introduction of quenched disorder in the system .",
    "the hamiltonian itself is not translational invariant in the quenched system but the physically relevant post - quenched observables are so , and it is possible for the system to violate the monogamy of bell inequality violation and quantum advantage for dense coding . the no - go theorems are at the level of observables , and in quenched disordered systems , it is the post - quenched quantities ( and not the pre - quenched ones ) that are physically meaningful .",
    "the analysis for the disordered quantum @xmath0 models is carried out by using the jordan - wigner , fourier and bogoliubov transformations , while that for the disordered quantum heisenberg model is by employing density matrix renormalization group techniques .",
    "finite - size scaling analysis is performed for all the models and for both the quantum characteristics considered .",
    "there is an ongoing effort in conquering no - go theorems in quantum mechanics either by going beyond the static framework of the quantum formalism @xcite or by relaxing quantum dynamical postulates like unitarity @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper shows another path for overcoming the no - go theorems of ordered systems , while still remaining within the quantum realm , by introducing impurities or defects .",
    "we acknowledge computations performed at the cluster computing facility at the harish - chandra research institute , india .",
