    "our best candidate for a theory of quantum gravity is string theory .",
    "however for string theory to be consistent , spacetime has to be higher - dimensional . for some time",
    "the only consistent way to resolve the apparent contradiction between theory and experiment was to assume that the extra dimensions are compactified on an internal manifold whose size is too small to be observed by experiment .",
    "however the realisation that string theory naturally gives rise to branes led randall and sundrum ( rs ) to discover that non - compact extra dimensions not neccessarily contradict observation @xcite . in their model",
    "they consider our universe being a 4 dimensional brane in a 5 dimensional bulk spacetime with negative cosmological constant .",
    "they prove that on the perturbative level the theory induced on the brane behaves like newtonian gravity as long as distances are long compared to the @xmath1 length @xcite .",
    "this led to the study of brane world gravity and brane world black holes in particular @xcite , since it was unclear whether agreement between the induced theory on the brane and 4d gravity extended beyond perturbation theory .",
    "although there was a lot of effort to find brane world black hole solutions none could be constructed analytically .",
    "even numerically it has so far been impossible to find a satisfactory answer although some progress was made @xcite .",
    "the only case in which a full analytic solution could be found was in one lower dimension . by considering the c",
    "- metric emparan , horowitz and myers were able to construct brane world black holes on flat branes @xcite and branes with negative cosmological constant @xcite in the lower dimensional equivalent of the randall - sundrum model .",
    "however in contrast to the perturbative results of randall and sundrum where agreement with @xmath2 gr was observed , in the lower dimensional case the induced theory on the brane significantly differs from @xmath3 gr .    a possible explanation for the impossibility to find brane world black hole solutions in the rs model was given by work based on the ads@xmath4cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "according to work on that correspondence @xcite the rs model is equivalent to a four dimensional effective theory of general relativity coupled to a cut - off cft .",
    "thus a brane world black hole in the rs model would be equivalent to a quantum - corrected black hole @xcite .",
    "that however means that one expects the black hole on the brane to hawking radiate and thus not to be static @xcite .",
    "this would of course explain why it has been impossible to obtain any kind of static solution .",
    "however it has also been pointed out that the validity of this argument may be flawed due to strong coupling effects , since these may lead to hawking radiation being further suppressed than one would expect naively @xcite .    one way to avoid the issue of whether a static solution exists or not is to consider extremal black holes .",
    "such black holes have zero temperature and thus would not hawking radiate in the dual theory . in a previous paper @xcite we thus considered extremal , static black holes which are charged with respect to a maxwell field on the brane and which are spherically symmetric on the brane .",
    "the further advantage of considering extremal black holes is that one can always solve for their near - horizon geometry instead of their full solution @xcite , which is a significantly easier problem .",
    "a main reason for doing this is that the black hole entropy can be determined from the near horizon limit alone and thus a meaningful comparison to @xmath2 gr is still possible . in @xcite",
    "the near - horizon limit of the brane world black hole was determined and for the induced theory on the brane agreement with @xmath2 gr was observed in the limit of large black holes .",
    "the main disadvantage of only knowing the near - horizon limit is that no statements can be made concerning whether it can be extended to a full brane world black hole solution .",
    "this paper partially answers that question . in the coming chapters a metric expansion around the near horizon limit of the bulk metric",
    "is set up and the first two subleading orders are determined .",
    "partially this is done analytically and partially by relying on numerical methods .",
    "having determined the bulk solution to second correction order the corresponding israel matching conditions are calculated and it is investigated whether these can be fulfilled by the bulk metric including corrections . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that there is a symmetry enhancement of the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes .",
    "it always contains a two dimensional maximally symmetric spacetime as a subspace . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in the case of the black hole in question this 2 dimensional space is @xmath5 .",
    "it was this symmetry enhancement that made it mathematically clear why one would expect the near horizon limit of the bulk metric to allow for a brane slicing .",
    "however this @xmath5 symmetry is broken by correction terms when we go beyond the near horizon limit .",
    "nonetheless it is found that the bulk can still be sliced by a brane .",
    "this is notable since due to the breaking of the @xmath5 symmetry there are potentially more independent constraint equations than free parameters at each order .",
    "the induced metric on the brane is determined and compared to the relevant @xmath2 gr metric .",
    "good agreement between the two is observed for black holes large compared to the ads scale .",
    "calculations beyond the second order correction terms which are not presented expicitly in this paper seem to indicate that the findings for the second order terms are stereotypical for any correction order @xmath6 .",
    "even though this paper does not prove that the near horizon limit can be extended to a full brane world black hole solution , it gives strong evidence supporting that case .",
    "a particular rs ii setup is considered which consists of an extremal static charged brane world black hole .",
    "it is natural to assume that the extension of the brane world black hole to the bulk is static as well .",
    "furthermore , since the surface gravity is constant in the bulk , it follows by continuity that it must take the same value in the bulk as it does on the brane . thus if the horizon is degenerate on the brane it will also be degenerate in the bulk . following @xcite and introducing gaussian null coordinates @xmath7 in the neighbourhood of the horizon , the bulk metric can be put in the form    ds^2=k(x , r)dv^2 + 2dv dr+ l_a(x , r ) dv dx^a+h_ab(r , x)dx^adx^b .",
    "@xmath8 generates time translations .",
    "the horizon is located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 due to extremality .",
    "we are only interested in the case of a spherically symmetric brane world black hole .",
    "this allows us to introduce coordinates @xmath11 making the bulk metric axisymmetric and simplyfying it to ds^2=k(,r)dv^2 + 2dv dr + l(,r ) dv d+ m(,r)^2 d^2 + n(,r)^2 d^2 .",

    "it was proven that there is a symmetry enhancement of the near horizon metric . following the methods applied in @xcite and changing gauge to a coordinate system in which the extra symmetry is more evident , the above metric becomes ds^2=()(k^2dv^2 + 2dv d ) + ( ) ^2 d^2 + ( ) ^2 d^2 , where @xmath12 can take the values @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 . in @xcite",

    "@xmath17 we can furthermore set @xmath18 . renaming metric functions and coordinates then leads to the near horizon metric determined in @xcite given by [ nearhorizon ] ds^2= a()^2 d^2 + d^2 + r()^2 d^2 , where @xmath19 is the metric on @xmath20 of unit radius .",
    "the equations governing @xmath21 and @xmath22 were determined to be + + + = , [ aeom ] + + + = , [ reom ] where @xmath23 is the ads radius of curvature .",
    "these were solved numerically in @xcite .",
    "furthermore in that paper a taylor series expansion of those functions about @xmath24 was determined , whose first terms are given by a = a_0+(+)+(-++)+  [ ataylor ] r = + ( + ) + ( -+)+  [ rtaylor ] i.e. the set of solutions forms a 1-parameter family labelled by the free parameter @xmath25 .    with @xmath21 of the near horizon metric given numerically ,",
    "we change the gauge of the general metric slightly by @xmath26 so that the new ansatz for the bulk metric is of the form [ generalmetric ] ds^2= a()^2(f(,r)dv^2 + 2dv dr ) + g(,r ) dv d+ h(,r)^2 d^2 + i(,r)^2 d^2 .",
    "the horizon is still located at @xmath9 and we still have @xmath27 due to extremality . the above gauge will be used for the remainder of this paper . in the following subsections the four undetermined metric functions will be determined as a power series expansion in @xmath28 around @xmath9 .",
    "using the zeroth order results from ( [ nearhorizon ] ) we have to first correction order @xmath29 h(,r)=1+h_1()r+o(r^2 ) , i(,r)=r()+r_1()r+o(r^2 ) , [ firstorder ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are to be determined .",
    "the equations governing these are determined by series expanding the einstein equations as a power series in @xmath28 around @xmath9 . requiring the first order corrections in this series to vanish gives rise to the equations of motion of the above functions .",
    "these equations are given by    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    since the black hole is static it follows that the killing vector @xmath38 is hypersurface orthogonal , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "this implies f_1()=c_1 , where @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "there is some residual gauge freedom related to rescaling @xmath41 and @xmath28 . using this gauge freedom the values the constant @xmath42 takes",
    "can be set to @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "+ furthermore the coordinate @xmath41 is only uniquely defined up to a translation by an arbitrary function of @xmath17 .",
    "this makes us consider first order gauge transformations of the form @xmath43 @xmath44 + r _ 3 ( ) .",
    "the reason we call these first order gauge transformations is that the zeroth order near horizon metric is unaffected by transformations of this kind and they only start showing up when going to first correction order .",
    "we have to be slightly careful though since the coordinate transformation will in general take us away from a gauge of the form ( [ generalmetric ] ) by introducing @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 terms .",
    "observe though that @xmath48 terms only enter at second correction order and thus we do nt have to worry about them at this point .",
    "this means that there are @xmath49 arbitrary gauge functions @xmath50 of which get fixed by requiring that the transformation considered above keeps the metric of the form ( [ generalmetric ] ) .",
    "this leaves @xmath15 function to eliminate one of the @xmath51 undetermined functions entering the metric in ( [ firstorder ] ) the particular gauge transformation we will consider is @xmath52 @xmath53 [ firstordergauge ] = - .",

    "+ equations ( [ firstordereomstart ] ) to ( [ firstordereomend ] ) can than be solved algebraically by f_1=c_1 , g_1=-c_1 , h_1=c_1 , r_1=0 .",
    "we should pause here and consider for what coordinate ranges the first order corrections are small compared to the leading order . from @xcite we know for @xmath55 that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are proportional to @xmath56 and for @xmath57 that @xmath58 and @xmath59 . from this",
    "it follows that as long as @xmath60 the first order corrections are small compared to the near horizon terms , i.e. there is no restriction on the range of @xmath17 .      using the above results , expand the metric to next order in r. @xmath61 h(,r)=1+c_1r+ h_2()r^2+o(r^3 ) , i(,r)=r()+0r + r_2()r^2+o(r^3 ) .",
    "it should be noted that at second or higher correction order there is no coordinate freedom left associated with a coordinate transformation equivalent to ( [ firstordergauge ] ) .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the requirements @xmath62 and @xmath63 fix all 3 gauge functions which arise or more geometrically that the original coordinate @xmath41 was defined uniquely up to a translation by an arbitrary function of @xmath17 .",
    "however in the case @xmath64 there still exists gauge freedom associated with a transformation of the form @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the same method as used in the previous section was applied to determine the equations of motion for the undetermined metric functions at second correction order , i.e. the einstein equations were power series expanded in @xmath28 up to second order and the second order equations give rise to equations of motion for the metric functions to be determined .",
    "after some algebra these equations can be partially solved algebraically in terms of a single undetermined function f_2=-+-+-- , g_2= , h_2=- .",
    "the function @xmath67 is then determined by the equation @xmath68 this equation could not be solved analytically",
    ". however it was solved numerically and the numeric results are shown in a later section . following the approach applied in @xcite",
    "some analytic progress can be made though .",
    "it was argued that since the horizon of the brane world black hole is compact , @xmath22 must vanish at some point which was chosen to be @xmath24 without loss of generality .",
    "smoothness at @xmath24 then implies that in the neighbourhood of that point @xmath21 and @xmath22 have taylor expansions of the form ( [ ataylor ] ) and ( [ rtaylor ] ) .",
    "similarly smoothness at @xmath24 implies that the taylor expansion of @xmath67 around that point is given by odd powers of @xmath17 .",
    "plugging this into the equation above determines @xmath69 to be given by [ r2series ] r_2=-^3+(++)+(---+)+     in contrast to @xmath42 , @xmath70 is generally not gauge , but a free parameter like @xmath25 .",
    "an exception to this occurs for @xmath64 in which case the coordinate transformation @xmath71 , @xmath72 sets the allowed values for @xmath70 to 0 or @xmath73 .",

    "one should contrast the appearance of new free parameters to @xmath2 extremal reissner - nordstrm .",

    ")d^2 , [ rngaugefield ] a_maxwell^rn= ( -+-+  )dt , only involves the single free parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the interpretation of this is that in the 4d case spherical symmetry fixes the corrections uniquely , whereas for the 5d bulk axisymmetry does not .",
    "we immediately conclude that , for the brane world black hole to be consistent with 4d general relativity , the israel matching conditions must fix any free parameter that appears in the correction terms .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case in the next section .",
    "following @xcite , we take the action of the brane to be s_brane = d^4z ( --f_ijf^ij ) , where @xmath76 is the brane tension , @xmath77 is the induced newton constant and @xmath78 is the maxwell field on the brane .",
    "we set @xmath76 to its randall - sundrum value @xmath79 , so that the induced cosmological constant on the brane vanishes .",
    "the induced newton constant is then accordingly @xmath80 .",
    "since we are looking for a spherically symmetric brane world black hole , it is natural to assume the maxwell field to be spherically symmetric as well .",

    "the most general brane position compatible with staticity and spherical symmetry is given by = _ 0+r_1+r^2_2+  .",
    "the zeroth order solution @xmath83 was determined in @xcite with the help of the zeroth order israel equations [ zerothisrael ] = - , = + . here",
    "we will go beyond the zeroth order and investigate whether the bulk solution can be sliced by a brane of the above form at first and second correction order and determine the induced metric on the brane in case the bulk can be sliced .",
    "we then compare the induced solution on the brane to extremal reissner nordstrm , which it should assymptote in the limit where the ratio @xmath84 is large , corresponding to large black holes .",
    "it should be pointed out that even though the near - horizon solution could be sliced by a brane , it is far from obvious on a mathematical level why the same should hold for the metric including corrections .",
    "mathematically the main reason one expected to be able to slice the near horizon geometry with a brane is the @xmath20 symmetry factor , which appears in the near horizon limit .",
    "this symmetry enhancement resulted in the number of constraint equations and the number of free parameters being equal .",
    "however , when going beyond the near horizon limit , the @xmath20 symmetry is broken and thus , at every correction order , the number of constraint equations one expects to be independent is always strictly bigger than the number of free parameters at that order .",
    "thus apriori one would not expect the near - horizon solution including correction terms to allow for a brane slicing .",
    "physically however we do expect the full solution to exist , which of course implies that the israel matching conditions can be fulfilled at each order and we will see below that this expectation is supported by our findings .      expanding ( [ israel ] ) as a power series expansion in @xmath28 around @xmath9 gives rise to a set of constraint equations at each order .",
    "the leading order equations are the constraints ( [ zerothisrael ] ) . at first correction order , the israel",
    "boundary equations give rise to 3 potentially independent constraints , which are given by    @xmath85    the only undetermined parameter in these equations is @xmath86 .",
    "however , after some algebra involving the equations of motion and ( [ zerothisrael ] ) , the above equations all simplify to the same equation @xmath87 thus , at first correction order , the bulk metric can indeed be sliced by a brane .",
    "it should be pointed out that the first order corrections are special in the sense that , in contrast to higher correction orders , all metric terms could be determined analytically in terms of the zeroth order solution .",
    "therefore the question whether the bulk can be sliced by a brane at first correction order could also be answered affirmatively without involving any numerical methods beyond those which were needed to show that the near horizon limit can be sliced by a brane . as can be seen in the next subsection ,",
    "this is different for higher order corrections since they involve functions which still need to be determined numerically .",
    "applying the same method as discussed in the previous subsection in order to determine the constraint equations at second correction order , we obtain 4 potentially independent constraints arising from ( [ israel ] ) .",
    "their exact form can be found in the appendix .",
    "there are two undetermined parameters which enter these equations : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "using one of the constraint equations , it is possible to solve for @xmath88 _ 2= , where @xmath75 was eliminated from the equation with the help of ( [ zerothisrael ] ) .    as was the case for the first order corrections , the remaining 3 equations are independent at the level of the equations of motion ,",
    "i.e. they all give different solutions as long as only equations ( [ aeom]),([reom]),([firstordereomstart ] ) to ( [ firstordereomend ] ) and the respective second correction order equations of motion are applied to simplify the constarints .",
    "however , when including all lower order israel constraints and setting @xmath90 , all @xmath49 equations simplify to [ casec0 ] 0=-5l r_2(_0 ) a(_0)+ a(_0)(6r_2(_0 ) + l r_2(_0 ) ) . doing the same in the case @xmath91 , they all reduce to    @xmath92",
    "remember that the second free paramater @xmath89 enters the above equations through @xmath93 .",
    "this shows that in these two cases a brane slicing might be possible .",
    "however , in contrast to the first order corrections , here we have to refer to numerical methods to determine whether there is an @xmath70 solving the respective equation above .",
    "we will be doing this in the next section .",

    "it then follows from plugging this into ( [ casec1 ] ) that @xmath128 . making use of ( [ largerho0 ] )",
    "it then implies that to leading order in @xmath75    r_2(_0 ) = + ... using the above expansions it can similarly be determined that to leading order in q _ 1= + ... _ 2= + ... having obtained the leading order behaviour of all the building blocks neccessary we can now use those results to calculate the leading order behaviour of the @xmath129 , yielding    e_1^brane= + ... e_2^brane=-+ ... e_3^brane=-+ ...    e_4^brane=-+ ... e_5^brane=-+ ...    thus we have shown analytically up to second correction order that the geometry of the brane world black hole asymptotes the extremal reissner nordstrm solution for large black holes .    assuming that the brane world black hole asymptotes @xmath2 gr in the limit of large charge we can go back to investigate the convergence of the power series expansion , i.e. compare the series solution of the brane world black hole induced on the brane to the full solution of the extremal reissner nordstrm geometry as functions of @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the ratios between the brane world black hole and the reissner nordstrm metric of the @xmath130 and @xmath131 components for a charge value of @xmath132 .",
    "as can be seen the power series solution is a very good approximation to @xmath2 gr up to @xmath133 .",
    "it follows from ( [ aexpansion ] ) and ( [ rexpansion ] ) that we expect the ratio of the @xmath130 components to asymptote 1 worse than the ratio of the @xmath131 components as @xmath134 .",
    "this behaviour is confirmed by the plot .",
    "furthermore it should be pointed out that the @xmath131 component of the brane world black hole approximates the full extremal reissner nordstrm solution very well even for @xmath135 .",
    "the reason for this is that the power series of the @xmath131 component of the full solution terminates at second order .",
    ", blue @xmath136",
    "the aim of this paper was to extend the results of @xcite .",
    "the main loophole left open was that there is no guarantee that the near horizon geometry constructed in that paper extends to a full black hole solution and furthermore that if the near horizon limit can be extended that the full solution allows for a brane slicing . even though a final proof of this could not be given here , strong evidence supporting that case",
    "was given : a perturbative expansion around the near horizon limit was set up and both the first and the second subleading correction terms were determined .",
    "it was shown that the metric including up to second order correction terms can still be sliced by a brane .",
    "this is remarkable as the inclusion of correction terms breaks the @xmath20 symmetry of the near horizon metric . that symmetry however was a main reason to expect the possibility of a brane slicing .",
    "furthermore the induced metric on the brane was investigated and it was determined that the brane world black hole asymptotes @xmath2 gr , i.e. the extremal reissner nordstrom metric , in the limit when the black hole is large compared to the @xmath1 scale .",
    "it should also be noted that the method to go beyond the near horizon limit which was applied here can in principle be extended to any correction order and that , while in practise more involved , conceptually the calculations carried out at every correction order @xmath137 are exactly the same as the calculations shown above for the second correction order : when solving the bulk metric 4 undetermined functions arise at each order 3 of which can be determined algebraically in terms of a single function .",
    "that single function is than determined by a second order ode .",
    "similarly there arise 4 possibly independent israel matching conditions and 2 free parameters at every order .",
    "even though the calculations were not included in this paper it was determined for the third order corrections that similarly to the second order corrections , these 4 equations reduce to 2 once lower order israel constraints are included . of course",
    "this does not prove anything about the general case .",
    "given the results obtained in this paper the aim of any work following up from it is first and foremost to provide a proof that the full brane world black hole solution exists .",
    "the work presented here certainly suggests that this is the case .",
    "there are two immediate ways to procede given the results above .",
    "the first is to generalize this work by proving that a brane slicing is possible at arbitrary correction order .",
    "the main problem with this is that it seems that the israel constraints at any given order can only be fulfilled assuming full knowledge of all lower order israel conditions .",
    "a systematic way to do this could not be found so far .",
    "the second way in which progress could be possible is to determine the full bulk solution using numerical methods . for this",
    "the above results will be instrumental as well since with their help elliptic data of the respective boundary value problem can be determined .",
    "of course the latter of the two options is preferable since it is constructive .",
