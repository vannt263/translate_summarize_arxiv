    "dust is of prime importance in cosmology , not only because it obscures our view on stellar populations , but also because its emission contains crucial information about the half of the energy emitted in the universe .",
    "dust can be formed by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and by supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "it is known that an agb star can produce up to @xmath2 of dust @xcite , whereas a sn can produce up to @xmath3 of dust @xcite .",
    "however , the sn shocks destroy the majority of the dust formed by a sn leaving only @xmath4 to be ejected into the interstellar medium ( ism ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    the dust yields derived observationally for sn remnants are usually @xmath5 except of cassiopeia  a @xcite and kepler @xcite , for which the derived dust yields are of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the dust formed by agb stars and by sne .",
    "based on the flat extinction curves , the sn - origin dust has been claimed to be present in distant quasars ( qsos ) and gamma - ray burst host galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "another option is that the stellar sources provide only the dust seeds and the bulk of the dust mass accumulation happens in the ism by the grain growth via capturing of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "the significant amounts of dust have been detected in the early universe up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "hence , its origin has to be explained by a process that is both efficient and rapid .",
    "several works have attempted modelling of the dust evolution at these high redshifts @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present more simplistic approach of estimating whether stellar sources are efficient enough to explain the dust detected at high redshifts .",
    "we selected six submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) at @xmath0 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* note that the currently highest - redshift smg from @xcite and @xcite is not included in this study ) and modelled their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) using the radiative transfer code grasil @xcite utilising the 35000 sed templates of @xcite the details of the sed modelling can be found in @xcite .    to extend the explored redshift range we selected nine quasars ( qsos ) at @xmath1 .",
    "their near - ir emission is dominated by active galactic nuclei instead of stellar population , so we approximated their stellar masses as a difference between the dynamical and the gas masses derived from the co line detections @xcite .",
    "the number of stars with masses between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the stellar population with a total mass of @xmath10 was calculated as @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "it is unclear what kind of the initial mass function ( imf ) is appropriate at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "hence , we adopted an imf with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and a slope @xmath15 ( * ? ? ? * or @xmath16 for a top - heavy imf ) .",
    "the average dust yield per star is @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "stars with masses @xmath19 need at least @xmath20 myr to enter the agb phase and start producing dust , so for agb stars the @xmath10 was replaced with the @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of stars created in the last @xmath20 myr .",
    "smgs @xcite . the extension to @xmath23",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "agb stars are not efficient enough and sne would need to be unfeasibly efficient to form dust in these sources suggesting rapid grain grown in the ism is likely to be responsible for the large dust masses . _ circles _ : the best estimates of the required dust yields .",
    "_ arrows _ : lower limits calculated for stellar masses without subtracting the young stars formed in the last @xmath20 myr . _ gray symbols _ indicate that a top - heavy imf was adopted .",
    "_ dashed line _ and _ diagonal lines _ : the dust yields derived for cassiopeia a , kepler ( @xmath6 ) and other sn remnants ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) , respectively .",
    "_ green area _ : theoretical dust yields for agb stars ( @xmath26 ) . _ light blue _ and _ blue areas _ : theoretical sn dust yields without ( @xmath27 ) and with dust destruction implemented ( @xmath4 ) , respectively . ]",
    "the required dust yields for smgs @xcite are shown on figure  [ fig : dust ] as a function of redshift . for similar representation of required dust yields for qsos",
    "see figure  1 of @xcite .    for both smgs and qsos the agb stars are not efficient enough to form dust in these objects as their required dust yields are higher than the range allowed by the theoretical modelling .",
    "if sne do not destroy the dust they form ( i.e.  eject up to @xmath6 of dust into the ism ) then they are efficient enough to explain dust in all @xmath28 smgs and qsos discussed here .",
    "however , the models predict that only @xmath29% of this dust survives the shocks @xcite and then even sne can not explain the dust in the most of these galaxies .",
    "we checked that this conclusion does not change when we allow both agb stars and sne to form only a fraction of dust ( fig .  2 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is because the required yields for agb stars exceed the allowed value by a factor of @xmath30 in most of the cases and therefore agb stars can account for only @xmath31% of dust detected in @xmath32 qsos .",
    "therefore the required dust yields for sne can be scaled down only slightly which does not suffice to bring them into the consistency with models with dust destruction implemented .",
    "hence , we found that neither agb star nor sne are able to fully account for dust detected in some @xmath28 galaxies .",
    "this indicates that a significant fraction of dust in these galaxies was formed by some other mechanism .",
    "one of the possibility is that the grain growth in the ism is responsible for dust accumulation .",
    "this process is relatively fast with the timescale of a few@xmath33 myr @xcite .",
    "therefore even at redshift @xmath34 this timescale is much shorter than the likely age of a galaxy .",
    "moreover , sne deliver enough heavy elements to fuel this growth @xcite .",
    "we investigated the possible dust producers in the smgs at @xmath0 and qsos at @xmath1 by estimating the required dust yields per agb star and per sn and comparing them to the allowed values derived from the theoretical models .",
    "we found that agb stars are not efficient to form dust in the majority of these galaxies leaving sne as the only likely stellar dust producers .",
    "however , the required dust yields for sne exceed the allowed values if dust destruction in the sn shocks is taken into account .",
    "this advocates for some other dust production mechanism e.g.  the grain growth in the ism .",
    "this process is fast enough and sne deliver enough heavy elements to build up the dust masses derived for these galaxies .",
