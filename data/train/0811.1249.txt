    "thz emission from intrinsic josephson junctions of the bscco type has received much attention recently .",
    "several experiments have been reported @xcite , in which thz radiation emitted from bscco single crystals were observed .",

    "a very convincing experiment was reported @xcite and it has attracted much focus and renewed experimental efforts .",
    "parallel to the experimental work there has been theoretical / numerical work on fluxon dynamics in in layered superconductors of the bscco type @xcite .",
    "the calculations demonstrate that the best way to obtain thz radiation is by having in - phase motion of the fluxons in the different layers .",
    "this poses an interesting problem since the in - phase state of traveling fluxons is an energetically unfavorable state , and two fluxons of equal polarity will consequently repel each other .",
    "however , due to the disparity of wave speeds for in - phase and out - of - phase solutions , it has been shown @xcite that the energetically unfavorable in - phase state of traveling fluxons are be stable above the asymptotic speed of the out - of - phase mode .",
    "it has been assumed that the best way to obtain that is by having flux flow generated by a magnetic field applied parallel to the a - b plane , as studied theoretically in ref . .",
    "however the successful experiment in ref . was done without a magnetic field , and it was suggested that an internal cavity ( based on the so - called fiske steps ) played a major role in the thz generation . in this paper",
