    "in this paper we study some of the equilibrium statistical properties of a confined helical or ribbon - like polymer .",
    "the cases of ( i ) a polymer contained in a cylindrical pore and ( ii ) a polymer wound around a cylindrical rod are considered .",
    "some motivation is provided by the following observations :    biological polymers differ from synthetic polymers in that they are semi - flexible , with a persistence length much larger than the monomer size , and usually have a helical structure .",
    "this is well known for dna , but f - actin also has a double - helical structure , while microtubuli are helical cylinders .",
    "the diameter of these biological polymers is in the range of 1 to 25 nm .",
    "polymeric helical structures are also found in self - assembling systems , consisting of either amphiphiles or peptides . in some cases the diameters and pitch lengths are much larger than for the biopolymers mentioned above .    in amphiphilic systems",
    "the formation of helical ribbons has been observed in multicomponent mixtures of a bile salt or some other nonionic surfactant , phosphatidylcholine or a fatty acid , and a steroid analog of cholesterol @xcite .",
    "the ribbons have typical diameters in the range of 5 to 20 @xmath1 m , and pitch angles between 10 and @xmath2 .",
    "other examples are ethanolic / water solutions of diacetylenic phospholipids , in which the formation of hollow tubules of diameter 0.6 @xmath1 m and typical lengths of 10 to 100 @xmath1 m has been observed @xcite .",
    "helically - coiled phospholipid - bilayer ribbons appear as metastable intermediates in the growth of these tubules .",
    "other systems , which show spontaneous assembly of ribbons , are aqueous solutions of peptides @xcite . depending on the solution conditions , the same peptide exists in different conformations , such as random coils , @xmath3-helices , or @xmath4-sheets . at not too low peptide concentrations , the molecules",
    "self - assemble into long @xmath4-sheet structures which form twisted ribbons ( with a straight central axis ) .",
    "the width of these ribbons is about 4 nm , and their length is of the order of 500 nm @xcite . these ribbons can aggregate due to face - to - face attraction into twisted fibrils of a thickness of 8 - 10 nm .    interestingly , in a self - assembling system of gemini surfactants ( two surfactant molecules covalently linked at their charged head group ) , the degree of twist and the pitch of the micrometer - scale ribbons has been found to be tunable by the introduction of opposite - handed chiral counterions @xcite .",
    "the confinement of polymers in cylindrical tubes is one of the classical problems in polymer physics . for biological polymers ,",
    "such a confinement occurs , for example , when viral dna of a bacteriophage squeezes through the narrow tail during dna injection .",
    "technological advances in the manipulation of single molecules in micro- and nanofluidic devices @xcite has fueled interest in the structure and dynamics of biological polymers in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "helical and twisted ribbons can be confined not only by external walls , but also by winding around each other , as in the fibril formation of twisted @xmath4-sheet peptides mentioned above .",
    "the simple model we consider , consisting of a helical wound around a thin cylinder , is a step in this direction but leaves out some important physical features , such as the face - to - face attraction in the fibrils .",
    "the free energy @xmath5 of confinement of a fluctuating polymer of contour length @xmath6 in a cylindrical pore of diameter @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the partition functions of the polymer with one end fixed in the presence and absence of the cylindrical confining geometry , respectively .",
