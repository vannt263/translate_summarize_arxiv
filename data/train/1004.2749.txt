    "in low dimensional systems , the description of transport in terms of linear phenomenological laws , that works well in three dimensions , may not be possible .",
    "one example is the fourier law which relates the thermal current density @xmath8 to the thermal gradient @xmath9 by @xmath10 , where the @xmath11 is the thermal conductivity of the material .",
    "theoretical investigations of a number of translation invariant one - dimensional systems show that the fourier law is not followed in these systems @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the current density to the thermal gradient is no longer independent of the system size .",
    "nevertheless this ratio , again called ` thermal conductivity ' , is still useful in characterizing anomalous transport .",
    "the calculation of ` thermal conductivity ' in these systems can be problematic .",
    "ideally one would like to calculate the non - equilibrium stationary state ( nss ) measure of the system and calculate the expectation values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 using the nss measure .",
    "this requires the existence of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) so that a local temperature @xmath12 is properly defined .",
    "a method generally used when considering a one dimensional system with its ends at two different temperatures @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is to calculate directly the current @xmath8 and the quantity @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the length of the system .",
    "another approach is to use the kubo - green formula which involves the time integral of the equilibrium current - current correlation function",
    ". the first formula does not require the existence of lte whereas the second does and it is not clear how the results from the two methods can be compared .    in 1-d systems with translation invariance ,",
    "the ` conductivity ' , @xmath11 , shows a power - law dependence on the size of the system ; @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "a question that has been investigated extensively is whether @xmath18 is universal across a class of systems .",
    "the other related questions are about the number of such universality classes and the values of @xmath18 characterizing them .",
    "such an investigation has to take into account the difficulties posed by the considerations in the previous paragraph .",
    "hydrodynamic mode - coupling theory predicts two universality classes corresponding to @xmath19 and @xmath20 for one - dimensional momentum conserving systems  @xcite .",
    "specific models of one - dimensional lattice systems with pair - wise nonlinear interactions between neighboring particles have been studied extensively using numerical and analytical methods  @xcite .",
    "the analytical studies involve approximations at some stage , whereas numerical studies are handicapped by the system size and the time scales that can be achieved in computers which makes it difficult to give a definitive answer to the question of the universality of @xmath18 .",
    "results of these studies agree with the hydrodynamic results that the generic value of @xmath18 is @xmath21 ; when the leading order nonlinearity is cubic @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "however , for the so - called fermi - pasta - ulam chain , where the nonlinearity is quartic , there is still no consensus ; numerical simulations show different values of @xmath18  @xcite and analytic calculations , both classical and quantum , show @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "apart from the obvious theoretical interest in these problems there has also been a lot of experimental interest in studying heat transport at micro and nano scales @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies on nanowires such as carbon nanotubes and boron - nitride nanotubes show a clear breakdown of the fourier law  @xcite . in order to attempt an understanding of realistic systems ,",
    "it is essential to include all the modes of vibrations .",
    "theoretical results , both numerical and analytical , mentioned above have been obtained for only the longitudinal vibrations of the chain .",
    "it is natural to investigate how the exponent @xmath18 is affected by the transverse vibrations .",
    "chains with both longitudinal and transverse vibrations have only been studied in the work of wang and li  @xcite .",
    "the wang - li model contains two kinds of intractions ; a pairwise interaction between the neighboring particles and another interaction that depends on the bending of the chain .",
    "the harmonic approximation of the model yields modes whose frequencies @xmath23 depend on the wave - vector @xmath0 in the following manner . for small q",
    ", the longitudinal modes have @xmath24 whereas the transverse modes @xmath25 .",
    "wang and li used the mode - coupling analysis ( mca ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to study this system .",
    "their first important observation from md simulations is that the phonon dispersions are strongly renormalized from their bare values , particularly the transverse phonon dispersion gets renormalized to become linear in q. for this reason they use an effective hamiltonian method in which the form of the hamiltonian and its parameters are taken from the md simulations . for the conductivity exponent",
    "they obtain a generic value @xmath20 , but they also observe a value of @xmath22 in their md simulations which is attributed to crossover effects . when the parameter measuring the strength of transverse vibrations is sufficiently large , they also find that @xmath19 .    in this paper , we study the quantum mechanical version of this model along the lines of  @xcite . in this procedure ,",
    "one essentially calculates the second order self - energy of the phonons self - consistently , which enables us to obtain the wave - vector dependent relaxation rate @xmath26 .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the chain is then obtained through the use of kubo formula .",
    "the finite size of the chain is taken into account by putting on the time integral in the kubo formula an upper cutoff proportional to the size of the chain @xcite .",
    "this prescription yields @xmath27 , where @xmath28 governs the small - q behavior of the relaxation rate , @xmath29 . for the wang - li model , we find that in the second - order perturbation calculation , the relaxation rate @xmath30 for the transverse phonon diverges as @xmath31 , whereas the relaxation rate @xmath32 for the longitudinal phonons becomes constant .",
    "this makes the bare phonons invalid normal modes .",
    "these divergences basically arise due to the @xmath33-dispersion of the transverse modes .",
    "this necessitates a self - consistent study of the phonon dispersion for this system @xcite .",
    "such studies have been done on several systems , including one - dimensional systems as test cases for the procedure @xcite . here",
    "we follow the method of gtze and michel @xcite which provides a nice connection between the mori - zwanzig mode coupling technique and the perturbation theory .",
    "we show that this procedure indeed renormalizes self - consistently the transverse phonon dispersion to be linear , in qualitative agreement with the numerical results of md simulations @xcite .",
    "we further note that the result on the renormalized frequencies is independent of the bare frequencies , but does depend on the fact that the cubic interaction vanishes linearly with q. since the vanishing of the interaction with any of its wave - vector arguments is a consequence of the translation invariance , this result should be generic to translation invariant one - dimensional systems .",
    "we then perform a self - consistent analysis for the relaxation rates of the renormalized modes using the second order perturbation diagrams .",
    "this procedure leads to integral equations from which small - q dependence of the relaxation rates @xmath34 can be extracted .",
    "the main results of this analysis are : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "gratifyingly , this behavior matches the results derived by wang and li for the classical system using the mode - coupling analysis , which arrives at the results through a seemingly different mechanism .",
    "finally we use these results for understanding the behavior of conductivity with the system length @xmath16 .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model and a calculation of the relaxation rates of the bare phonons . as mentioned above , this calculation shows that the modes are not well defined .",

    "this model consists of a chain of equal mass point particles with two kinds of interactions .",
    "first is a pairwise interaction between nearest - neighbor particles which depends only on the absolute value of the distance between the particles and the second is a three particle interaction between neighbors that takes into account the bending of the chain .",
    "there are two transverse directions , but due to the axial symmetry of the chain the two directions are entirely equivalent .",
    "accordingly for understanding the qualitative role of the transverse vibrations on the relaxation of modes and transport , it suffices to consider just one transverse mode . in terms of the position @xmath35 and momentum @xmath36 vectors ,",

    "this is a complicated many body problem .",
    "one assumes that a few lower - order terms in the taylor expansion of the nonlinear potential is enough to give the generic physical picture .",
    "also the low - temperature transport properties of the system are expected to be described by the low - energy modes of the system .",
    "so we set up the problem in terms of phonon modes . denoting the deviation from equilibrium position of the particles by @xmath42 we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "fourier transform along the length of the chain is defined by @xmath45 where @xmath6 is the number of particles in the chain .",

    "translation invariance imposes two conditions on @xmath50 ; they vanish when any of the wave - vectors is set to zero and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is unity when @xmath54 is a reciprocal lattice vector and zero otherwise .",

    "henceforth we choose units in which @xmath56 .",
    "the reflection symmetry in the transverse direction permits only two kinds of cubic terms to be nonzero , these being @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "both these interactions are proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "these forms are generic when the potentials are taken to be functions of absolute values of relative displacements ( @xmath60)@xcite .    for the fermi - pasta - ulam chain  @xcite in which only the longitudinal vibrations are considered , the perturbation analysis is done around the bare phonon modes as they are well defined . but in this model we shall see that the bare phonon modes are not well defined , as the relaxation rates of the two kinds of phonons are not zero even for zero wave - vector mode .",
    "this requires that one works with the renormalized phonons as discussed below .",
    "we begin by calculating the relaxation rates of the bare phonons . for this purpose",

    "the angular brackets correspond to thermal averages defined by @xmath70/tr[e^{-\\beta h}]$ ] .",
    "the @xmath71 s are thus 2x2 matrices in polarization indices , but in the present case , the reflection symmetry in the transverse direction allows only the diagonal components to be nonzero . in the following",
