    "the two gap superconductor mgb@xmath0 is considered to be a good candidate for superconducting devices due to its comparatively high critical temperature , its easy handling and cheap preparation .",
    "presently , its use in josephson junctions is being investigated  @xcite .",
    "one of its peculiar properties is the presence of two distinct superconducting gaps existing on different bands at the fermi surface .",
    "these bands are @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands arising from the boron @xmath3 and @xmath4/@xmath5 orbitals , respectively @xcite .",
    "these two types of bands possess different parity with respect to reflection at the boron plane .",
    "this different parity suppresses scattering and transitions between the two types of bands , which is thought to be the main reason for the exceptional stability of the two gaps against impurity scattering @xcite .    in the vicinity of a josephson junction",
    "this parity can be broken , if the two mgb@xmath0 electrodes are grown with a misorientation angle of the crystal @xmath6-axis directions on both sides of the junction .",
    "the size of the misorientation angle would provide a means of tuning the strength of interband transitions between the two sides of the junction .",
    "this is what we wish to explore in the present work . in particular , we want to study the differential conductance of such a junction and demonstrate how these interband processes show up in the tunneling conductance and in andreev reflections .    due to the importance of josephson junctions in numerous applications",
    "the josephson effect has been subject of intense theoretical study .",
    "the current - phase relation as well as the oscillation of the electron transport in a voltage biased point contact known as the ac - josephson effect has been theoretically investigated for different situations  @xcite including unconventional superconductivity  @xcite , spin active magnetic barriers  @xcite and the effect of pair breaking due to disorder  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that within the quasiclassical theory interfaces can be described by effective boundary conditions  @xcite that can be included by mainly two different approaches : the scattering - matrix approach and the transfer - matrix approach  @xcite .",
    "both are formally equivalent but the range of applicability is different and the problem under consideration can help to decide which one should be chosen . here , we are going to generalize the transfer - matrix approach to the case of a multiband josephson junction and use it to calculate the differential conductance of a mgb@xmath0 josephson junction with misoriented electrodes .",
    "the effects of quasiparticle and josephson tunneling between two multiband electrodes with application to mgb@xmath0 have been theoretically discussed by brinkman et al . within an extended btk - model  @xcite explaining convincingly the absence of a double gap structure in @xmath6-axis tunneling spectra .",
    "novel josephson effects between multiband and singleband superconductors including the claim of a phase shift of @xmath1 between the different gaps on the multiband side have been theoretically discussed by agterberg et al .",

    "the experimental observation of subharmonic gap structures in mgb@xmath0 single crystal junctions  @xcite and mgb@xmath0/nb micro - constrictions  @xcite due to multiple andreev reflections can be understood within a multiband transfer - matrix approach .",
    "we will start in the next section with a description of the transfer - matrix model generalizing the approach to include the effect of multiple gaps . in the third section we will derive the current expression for both the equilibrium case without an applied voltage and the non - equilibrium case with an applied voltage . in the fourth section we will model the effective hopping amplitudes at the interface making use of some general considerations . in the fifth section we will show the results of our calculations while in the last section we will conclude .",
    "the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity has been proven to be a powerful tool to consider spatially inhomogeneous problems in equilibrium and non - equilibrium , for example to calculate the local quasiparticle density of states around vortices or in the vicinity of boundaries .",
    "however it is only valid within the quasiclassical limit @xmath7 and can therefore only describe situations with slowly varying fields and potentials ( on the scale of the coherence length ) .",
    "the interface between two superconducting regions of different orientation or between a normal metal and a superconductor represents a strong pertubation on a lengthscale much smaller than the coherence length which is  in principle  out of the range of validity of the quasiclassical theory . to describe this strong pertubation within the quasiclassical limit one has to find effective boundary conditions that connect the solutions on both sides .",
    "the first formulation of these boundary conditions for nonmagnetic interfaces has been found by zaitsev  @xcite .",
    "afterwards they have been generalized by millis et al .",
    "@xcite for magnetic active interfaces and have been explicitly solved by shelankov  @xcite for equilibrium problems and complemented by eschrig  @xcite for non - equilibrium problems within the powerful riccati parametrization of the quasiclassical theory  @xcite . to describe the complicated processes at the interface between two superconductors including multiple andreev scattering the transfer - matrix approach",
    "has been proven to be as well suitable as the scattering - matrix approach but gives a more intuitive understanding .",
    "to describe what is happening at the boundary between two superconductors with several fermi surfaces we will generalize in this work the transfer - matrix description of cuevas and fogelstrm  @xcite and kopu et al .",
    "@xcite for multiple fermi surfaces .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is to consider two decoupled superconducting electrodes described by two electrode green s functions @xmath8 that are calculated in a left ( @xmath9 ) and a right ( @xmath10 ) half - space with an inpenetrable surface . in a second step",
    "we allow virtual hopping processes between the two electrodes including the possibility of intraband and interband hopping .",
    "this serial expansion is exactly summed up to infinite order using the technique known from the dyson formalism . as has been shown by kopu et al .",
    "this pertubative transfer - matrix approach is equivalent to other methods and can be used to calculate interfaces with arbitrary transparency . in the following",
    "we will repeat the steps described by cuevas and fogelstrm and we will discuss the consequences that arise from the multiband character of the superconducting pairing interaction . to describe the hopping processes we start with a phenomenological transfer hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote band indices corresponding to a special fermi surface and introducing the effective hopping amplitudes @xmath14 describing hopping processes from band @xmath13 in the right electrode to band @xmath12 in the left electrode , and @xmath15 correspondingly . in this formulation",
    "we have enlarged our hilbert space to include not only the band index but also the quantum number of the electrodes . the full green s function and the @xmath16-matrix",
    "can be written as @xmath17 taking into account reflection ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and transmission processes ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "the green s functions @xmath22 and @xmath16-matrices @xmath23 themselves are @xmath24-matrices in the enlarged band space where @xmath25 is the number of bands @xmath26 consisting of 2@xmath272-matrices in keldysh space , denoted by the check symbol @xmath28 the retarded , advanced and keldysh green s functions are 2@xmath272 nambu - gorkov matrices in particle - hole space while we will neglect the spin degrees of freedom since we are concerned with spin singlet systems and we assume only non - magnetic interactions . besides the full green s functions we also have to consider the green s functions of the unperturbed left and right electrodes , which take a diagonal form in the space of the two electrode quantum numbers , and we can write down the coupling parameters as off - diagonal elements in the same notation : @xmath29 since we want to neglect direct interband scattering in the decoupled left and right electrodes the self - energy and therefore also the unpertubed green s functions take diagonal form in band space @xmath30 we will see in the following that the full matrix structure of the @xmath31 in band space prevents us from an easy decoupling of the different matrix elements as it can be done in the space of the electrode quantum numbers . therefore we have to solve the full matrix problem in band space . with regard to the application to the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath0 ,",
    "where interband scattering processes are suppressed  @xcite , we will go on with these simplified diagonal electrode green s functions but of course it is straight forward to extend the considerations to a full matrix problem including interband scattering .",
    "the transmission processes can now be summed up in form of a @xmath16-matrix equation with @xmath32 this equation has to be complemented by the dyson equation which reads @xmath33 using the first identity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t - matrix ] ) repeatedly we can write @xmath34 if we now employ the diagonal structure of the unperturbed green s functions und the off - diagonal structure of the hopping matrices in the space of the electrode quantum numbers we get the following set of decoupled equations for the components of @xmath35 . we note the diagonal ( reflection ) elements of the @xmath16-matrix as @xmath36 and we can write the off - diagonal ( transmission ) elements as @xmath37 now we can perform the quasiclassical integration since there are no functions with spatial arguments from both sides of the interface any more .",

    "since there are no andreev bound states at the interface without a sign change of the order parameter for reflected trajectories we do not expect dramatic changes of the pairing potential amplitude near the boundary . in this case",
