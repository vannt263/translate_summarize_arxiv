    "the phase separation of alloys and other unstable mixtures ( binary fluids , glasses , polymer blends ) has been extensively studied for decades @xcite . in a typical experiment ,",
    "a stable mixture is quenched into an unstable state by a sudden change in an external control parameter , mostly temperature or pressure .",
    "then , domains of the new equilibrium phases develop and coarsen , leading to a heterogeneous material .",
    "as the mechanical and transport properties of an alloy may depend considerably on its microstructure , the understanding of the dynamics of domain formation and growth is of great practical importance .",
    "in addition , phase separation is an interesting example of a process where spontaneous pattern formation occurs during the approach to equilibrium .    in recent years",
    ", attention has been drawn to surface effects on spinodal decomposition , mainly due to interesting experimental results on polymer blends @xcite .",
    "thin films of mixture are placed between glass plates , or between a substrate and vacuum , and quenched .",
    "if the interactions with the surface favor one of the components , this component rapidly segregates to the surface and triggers phase separation in the bulk : one observes surface - directed spinodal decomposition , during which concentration waves propagate from the surface into the sample . in some of the experiments ,",
    "modulations parallel to the surface are observed , leading to a pattern along the surface with a distinct length scale @xcite .",
    "the surface effects are in competition with bulk spinodal decomposition , and only a thin layer is affected by the surface , whereas in the interior of the sample the usual bulk structures are found .",
    "interesting questions are then what determines the type of structures found at the surface , and to predict typical length scales and growth rates of the patterns , as well as the thickness of the surface layer .",
    "the dynamics of spinodal decomposition near planar substrates has been investigated using continuum models @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite , and mean - field kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , very little is known about free surfaces , which can deform during the decomposition process @xcite .",
    "we have recently found that surface modes and spinodal waves at free surfaces can be observed in a simple lattice model @xcite , and the present paper is devoted to a detailed study of this phenomenon .",
    "the classical theory for the early stage of spinodal decomposition , based on out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics , was proposed by cahn and hilliard @xcite .",
    "the cahn - hilliard equation is obtained by postulating that the local interdiffusion currents are proportional to the gradients of the local chemical potential , and supposing that this chemical potential can be derived from a free energy functional of ginzburg - landau type .",
    "the proportionality constant is the atomic mobility , which is a phenomenological parameter in this theory . for a homogeneous initial state",
    ", the cahn - hilliard equation may be linearized around the average composition , and analyzed in terms of fourier modes .",
    "long wavelength perturbations grow exponentially with time , whereas short wavelength fluctuations are damped by the gradient terms , related to the surface tension . a typical length scale of the resulting domain pattern is then given by the wavelength of the fastest growing mode .",
    "it has been recognized that simplified lattice models are valuable tools to study the influence of microscopic dynamics on the process of phase separation in metallic alloys .",
    "they provide a convenient conceptual framework with a minimum number of parameters .",
    "such lattice gas models assume the existence of a fixed crystal lattice , the sites of which can be occupied by the atoms of different species , or by vacancies .",
    "a configuration evolves by atomic jumps from site to site .",
    "many studies have been carried out on the kinetic ising model with kawasaki spin exchange dynamics @xcite , which corresponds to the direct exchange of atoms . in most alloys , however , the dominant mechanism of diffusion is a vacancy mechanism @xcite , and several models of vacancy - mediated spinodal decomposition have been investigated @xcite . in our model , the rates for atomic jumps follow an arrhenius law .    a standard procedure to investigate the dynamics of such models are monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the simulations constitute a genuine realization of the stochastic model , and all correlations in space and time are preserved . but for the same reason , an analytic understanding is difficult . therefore , there have been numerous attempts to formulate microscopic kinetic equations which are analytically tractable .",
    "these equations are derived from the microscopic master equation by an approximation of mean - field type . while the linearized equation of khatchaturyan @xcite is valid only near equilibrium , recently several authors have proposed fully nonlinear kinetic equations for ising and lattice gas models @xcite .",
    "these equations can be cast in the form of generalized cahn - hilliard equations , where the atomic mobility depends explicitly on the details of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "such equations have been applied successfully to the study of phase - separation dynamics in binary and ternary systems @xcite , and to dendritic growth @xcite . in particular , kinetic equations for models with vacancy dynamics",
    "have been proposed by chen and geng @xcite and by puri and sharma @xcite .",
    "we will follow the approach developed by one of the present authors @xcite , which allows to relate the microscopic equations in a particularly straightforward manner to the equations of out - of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "all the studies of vacancy - mediated phase separation we are aware of start from a homogeneous initial state .",
    "we study here the evolution of droplets of a dense mixture with few vacancies , immersed in a bath of vacancy - rich `` vapor '' phase .",
    "the interesting point in this situation is that we can have interfaces between an unstable mixture and a stable vapor which are `` neutral '' , that is without segregation of one of the components .",
    "such interfaces are impossible in a binary model like the ising model , where any stable phase below the critical temperature favors one of the components .",
    "in our model , the atoms situated near the surface of the droplets have a larger mobility than bulk atoms .",
    "therefore , phase separation is fastest at the surface .",
    "we observe different structures at the surface , depending on the model parameters and the initial composition of the mixture . in the specially symmetric case of equal interaction energies and concentrations for both components",
    ", we obtain a regularly modulated surface mode which generates an ordered pattern in a surface layer . for asymmetrical interaction energies or compositions ,",
    "surface - directed spinodal waves are observed .",
    "this difference can be explained by a competition between surface spinodal decomposition and surface segregation .",
    "we determine the characteristic length scales and growth rates of bulk and surface modes by a linear stability analysis of the mean - field kinetic equations .",
    "our approach allows thus to relate morphological parameters to the interaction parameters of the microscopic model .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we present the model and the derivation of the mean - field kinetic equations .",
    "3 describes the simulations , which are analyzed in sec .",
    "4 : a linear stability analysis is performed in the bulk and at the surface .",
    "5 presents the discussion of the results .",
    "we consider a simple cubic lattice in @xmath0 dimensions , with lattice constant @xmath1 and a total number of @xmath2 sites . the sites can be occupied by atoms of two species , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , or by vacancies @xmath5 .",
    "the occupation numbers at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , are equal to @xmath9 if site @xmath6 is occupied by species @xmath8 , and zero otherwise .",
    "double occupancy is forbidden , which gives the constraint @xmath10 .",
    "hence there are two independent variables per site ; we choose in the following @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we consider only interactions between nearest neighbor atoms : the energy of a configuration @xmath13 is given by the hamiltonian h(c ) = - _ , [ hamilabv ] where the sum is over all nearest neighbor pairs @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the interaction energies between two atoms occupying two nearest neighbor sites .",
    "vacancies do not interact with atoms or other vacancies . unlike in a binary model , where the phase diagram is completely determined by the exchange energy @xmath16 , here the interaction energies are independent .",
    "one of them sets the temperature scale , the other two are free parameters .",
    "it can be shown that eq .",
    "( [ hamilabv ] ) is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a general ternary system ( see appendix ) .",
    "the configuration evolves by jumps of atoms to a neighboring vacant site .",
    "this is a common diffusion mechanism in metals , and the associated energy barrier is usually much lower than for a direct interchange of atoms .",
    "we therefore will completely neglect the latter process . as appropriate for activated processes ,",
    "the hopping rates are assumed to follow an arrhenius law .",
    "the underlying physical picture is that the atoms are trapped in potential wells located around the sites of the lattice .",
    "atoms spend most of their time near a lattice site , but from time to time they jump over the energy barrier between neighboring sites , the necessary energy being provided by the lattice phonons .",
    "we assume two contributions to the barriers : a constant activation energy @xmath17 and the local binding energy , @xmath18 , which depends on the local configuration .",
    "the jump rate from site @xmath6 to @xmath19 is w_ij^= _ 0^. here , @xmath20 is the temperature ( constant throughout the system ) and @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the prefactor @xmath22 is related to a vibration frequency of the atom in the well ( at least in the absolute eyring regime ) .",
    "we can absorb the constant @xmath17 in a prefactor which sets the time scale , @xmath23 . in principle ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are different ; however , simulation results indicate that qualitative results are unaffected by the ratio @xmath26 as long as it is not too far from unity @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will take in the following @xmath27 .",
    "the jump rates become w_ij^= w_0 .",
    "[ jumprates ] here and in the following , summation over @xmath1 means a sum over all nearest - neighbor sites .    the jump rates in eq .",
    "( [ jumprates ] ) define a stochastic process . to describe its time evolution",
    ", one may use the master equation for the probability distribution @xmath28 of finding configuration @xmath29 at time @xmath30 : = _ c(p(c,t ) w(c,c ) - p(c , t ) w(c , c ) ) .",
    "the transition rates @xmath31 from configuration @xmath29 to @xmath32 are equal to @xmath33 given by eq .",
    "( [ jumprates ] ) if the two configurations differ only by an exchange of a particle and a vacancy , and zero otherwise .",
    "given a solution to the master equation , one can formally define a time - dependent average for any operator @xmath34 , function of the occupation numbers , by o(t ) = _ c o(\\{n_i^ } ) p(c , t ) .",
    "in particular , we define the time - dependent occupation probabilities of the sites : p_i^(t ) = ( t ) .",
    "these probabilities can also be interpreted as local concentrations . to obtain a kinetic equation for @xmath35 ,",
    "one differentiates both sides of the above equation with respect to time and uses the master equation .",
    "the result is a conservation law for the local occupation probability , = -_a j_ii+a^. [ conserv ] the currents @xmath36 through the link @xmath37 are given by j_ij^= .",
    "[ strom ] the prefactors of the jump rates assure that the start site is occupied by an @xmath8-atom and the target site is empty .    up to now , the kinetic equation is equivalent to the complete master equation . to obtain a closed system of equations for the occupation probabilities @xmath38",
    ", we make a mean - field approximation and replace the occupation numbers in the expressions for the currents by their averages @xmath38 .",
    "clearly , this approximation is drastic : the resulting equations are a set of coupled deterministic differential equations .",
    "fluctuations are suppressed , and the mean - field approximation does not take into account correlations . nevertheless , as in the case of static mean - field approximations , one can use this method to get qualitative results on the dynamics of microscopic models .",
    "similar approximations have been discussed by several authors @xcite . a possibility to improve",
    "systematically the simple mean - field equations is the use of the path probability method ( ppm ) devised by kikuchi @xcite .",
    "the equations of the ppm , however , are considerably more complicated , and simulations on bulk spinodal decomposition have shown that the use of the ppm in the pair approximation leads to the same qualitative conclusions as the simple mean - field approximation @xcite . therefore , we will study in the following only the mean - field case .",
    "we generalize to our ternary model the method developed for binary systems in ref .",
    "the equations for the currents can be written as a product of a prefactor @xmath39 , symmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath6 and @xmath19 , and the difference of two local terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 , equivalent to chemical activities : j_ij^= - s_ij^(c_j^- c_i^ ) , with s_ij^= w_0 ( 1-p_i^a - p_i^b)(1-p_j^a - p_j^b ) and c_i^= p_i^1-p_i^a - p_i^b .",
    "this factorization is not unique ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "our particular choice makes it straightforward to establish a connection to the phenomenological equations of out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics .",

    "furthermore , for a closed system ( no currents crossing the boundaries ) , @xmath46 can only decrease .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by taking its time derivative , using ( [ curmob ] ) and noticing that the mobility is always positive : = _ i , fp_i^ d p_i^dt = - _ , m_ij^ ( _ j^-_i^)^2 .",
    "therefore , the dynamics leads to a state which minimizes the static mean - field free energy .",
    "this final state may be the ground state ( global minimum ) or a metastable state ( local minimum ) ; we can not describe nucleation events , unless we explicitly introduce fluctuations , for example by adding langevin noise to the deterministic equations .",
    "stated in terms of chemical potentials and mobilities , our kinetic equations have the form of generalized cahn - hilliard equations .",
    "in contrast to the phenomenological equations , the mobilities depend on the local configuration and are related to the details of the microscopic jump processes , albeit in an approximate manner .",
    "this allows in principle an application of these equations to situations far from equilibrium , and to situations where the mobility depends strongly of the local concentration . for the vacancy dynamics considered here , the concentrations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent variables , but",
    "their evolution is coupled by the vacancy field .",
    "the mobilities are higher in regions with high vacancy concentration . to see this , consider the mobilities for a homogeneous system . for @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,",
    "( [ mobil ] ) becomes m^_hom(|p^a , |p^b ) = w_0 |p^(1-|p^a-|p^b ) .",
    "[ mobhom ] this expression has a simple interpretation : the prefactor is the mean - field probability of finding an @xmath8-atom and a vacancy on neighboring sites , and @xmath50 times the exponential term is the mean jump rate .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the mean - field approximation there are no `` off - diagonal terms '' in the mobility matrix : in general , one should obtain an expression for the currents of the form @xmath51 .",
    "the reason for these terms missing is probably the suppression of all correlations in eq .",
    "( [ strom ] ) by the mean - field approximation . in the present context",
    ", this deficiency seems to be of little importance .",
    "it should be noted that even if the off - diagonal mobilities are zero , the same is not true for the diffusion coefficients , because the chemical potentials involve the concentrations of both species .    from the free energy density , we can obtain the phase diagram .",
    "we will consider only completely attractive models here , where no order - disorder transitions occur ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) . the conditions for phase coexistence are that the chemical potentials and the grand potential , @xmath55 be equal in the two ( or three ) phases .",
    "this is equivalent to a `` common tangent plane '' construction : the free energy density , function of two variables , defines a surface in the space @xmath56 .",
    "the ( homogeneous ) chemical potentials as functions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 define the orientation of planes tangent to this surface .",
    "the condition of equal grand potential implies that the points representing two ( or more ) phases in equilibrium must lie in the same plane .",
    "thus we can obtain the phase diagram by constructing all the planes that are tangent to the free energy surface in at least two points .",
    "various structures of phase diagrams can be obtained @xcite . for attractive interactions ,",
    "quite generally the free energy surface has three minima for sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "then , there exists exactly one plane which is tangent in three points : we have three - phase coexistence .",
    "besides , there are families of double tangent planes which give the coexistence lines for two - phase coexistence . for @xmath59 ,",
    "our model is equivalent to the blume - emery - griffiths model @xcite .",
    "we will focus in this paper on the specific example @xmath60 . as we then have @xmath61 , the phase diagram is completely symmetric with respect to the interchange of any two components and may be calculated using the analogy with the three state potts model ( see appendix ) .",
    "the phase diagram for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( two dimensions ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figphasediag ] .",
    "there is a large region where an a - rich , a b - rich , and a vacancy - rich `` vapor '' phase coexist . in the regions of two - phase coexistence ,",
    "the concentration of the third component is very low .",
    "from formula ( [ mobhom ] ) we can immediately deduce that the mobility in the dilute `` vapor''-phase , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are small , is much larger than in the two dense phases . as we have @xmath64",
    ", the diffusion of the minority component is always faster than that of the majority component in the dense phases .",
    "the part of the phase diagram which is most appropriate for the description of an alloy is the region of ab - coexistence with low vacancy concentration .",
    "all studies of lattice gas dynamics with vacancies we are aware of are limited to this area .",
    "we will investigate the behavior of finite `` droplets '' of such a material immersed in a stable `` vapor '' , a very natural situation which can arise for instance when droplets of a liquid mixture in coexistence with its vapor are rapidly quenched into an unstable state .",
    "evidently , our model is not adapted to describe diffusion processes in a vapor , where diffusion does not take place via activated jumps to nearest neighbor sites .",
    "but the important feature of this `` vapor '' phase is that diffusion is much faster than inside the `` solid '' .",
    "moreover , the atomic mobility decreases continuously across the vapor - mixture interface , and hence at the surface the diffusion is faster than inside the bulk .",
    "as we shall see , this induces fast surface modes .",
    "we integrated the mean - field kinetic equations by an explicit euler scheme .",
    "the time step is limited by the numerical stability of the algorithm . for our inhomogeneous system ,",
    "the `` most dangerous '' regions of the simulation domain are those where the diffusion is fastest , thus the vapor phase . for the diffusion equation with a diffusivity @xmath65 , the maximum time step is @xmath66 in @xmath0 dimensions . for the temperatures and vapor compositions we used ,",
    "@xmath67 is slightly less than unity .",
    "we integrated with a maximum time step of @xmath68 in 2d and @xmath69 in 3d without encountering numerical instabilities .",
    "when we started with step functions as initial conditions , the time step had to be chosen much smaller at the beginning and was then slowly increased to the maximum value .",
    "as initial state , we chose `` droplets '' ( i.  e. circular domains ) or slabs of a mixture with few vacancies ( typically some percents ) and concentrations @xmath70 and @xmath71 , immersed in a vapor of concentrations @xmath72 and @xmath73 . to trigger the phase separation , we added small fluctuations to the initial state . to assure mass conservation , pairs of neighboring sites and a component ( a or b ) were randomly chosen , and the concentrations at the two sites were shifted by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , where @xmath76 is a random number uniformly distributed between @xmath77 and @xmath9 .",

    "[ figdroplet ] .",
    "phase separation starts at the surface : a fairly regular modulation appears along the mixture - vapor interface .",
    "this surface mode triggers phase separation in adjacent regions and propagates into the interior of the sample with a constant velocity , leaving behind a checkerboard - like ordered structure .",
    "the domains often coalesce to form stripes .    to see more in detail what happens at the interface , we plot in fig .",
    "[ figintersym ] several snapshots of the concentration profiles along a line which is normal to the surface at a randomly chosen point .",
    "the initial step profile quickly relaxes to a smooth shape and stays nearly stationary , until on a slower time scale b is enriched and a depleted ; at other interface points , the opposite happens .",
    "an oscillatory concentration profile develops , with an amplitude which has its maximum in the interface and decays into the solid .",
    "we will show below that the envelope of this oscillation becomes a decaying exponential away from the surface .",
    "the fact that the perturbation decays exponentially with the distance from the surface , but grows exponentially with time , explains the constant propagation velocity of the decomposition front .",
    "note that the concentrations in the vapor vary only very slightly : the vapor is a stable phase , and hence perturbations decay . because of the fast diffusion in the vapor , the surroundings of the droplet act as a particle reservoir .",
    ".5 in .5 in    as the surface mode develops , the mixture - vapor interface deforms , and fingers of vapor start to grow into the interior of the droplet .",
    "this is the result of a mullins - sekerka instability @xcite with respect to the vacancies . to clarify this point",

    "[ figvac ] snapshots of the vacancy concentration during the decomposition process . at the beginning",
    ", the vacancy concentration stays constant and equal to the initial value .",
    "once the decomposition process reaches its nonlinear stage , however , vacancies are expelled from the domains of the new equilibrium phases .",
    "these excess vacancies have to diffuse to the surface of the droplet .",
    "a finger of vapor protruding into the mixture enhances the concentration gradients around its tip , and hence grows faster than a flat portion of the surface .",
    "in addition , the diffusion is faster in the initial mixture than in the phase - separated domains .",
    "the growth of the fingers stops when a layer of decomposed material has formed around their entire contour .",
    "the diffusion then takes place mainly along the domain boundaries , where the vacancies are enriched .",
    "the fingers are smoothed out by the subsequent coarsening process .",
    "the propagation of the surface mode stops when the bulk modes enter the nonlinear regime .",
    "the structures in the interior of the sample are the usual bicontinuous patterns of bulk spinodal decomposition at equal volume fractions .",
    "both surface and bulk structures coarsen by the evaporation - condensation mechanism .",
    "this process is faster at the surface because of the rapid diffusion through the vapor . at the exterior surface of the droplet",
    ", there exist trijunction points where the three phases are in contact .",
    "the angles between the interfaces at these points are fixed by the local equilibrium between the three surface tensions of av , bv , and ab - interfaces . for our symmetric choice of interaction energies ,",
    "all angles are @xmath84 in local equilibrium .",
    "the initial values for the concentrations in our example represent a special choice : the chemical potentials of the two species and the grand potential have the same value in the mixture and in the vapor .",
    "there exists exactly one set of concentrations satisfying these conditions at a given temperature . in this special case",
    ", there is no net mass flux between vapor and mixture , and the interface is at rest .",
    "this choice was mainly made to simplify the stability calculations to be presented below .",
    "the existence of a surface mode , however , is not limited to this special case . for other initial conditions ( but still @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , a surface mode develops while the mixture - vapor interface slowly moves .    to obtain more quantitative information about the phase separation process , we repeated our simulation with the same parameters , but this time in a stripe geometry : a slab of mixture along the @xmath87-direction is immersed in the vapor ; we thus have two straight interfaces normal to the @xmath88 axis .",
    "a convenient quantity for the analysis of phase separation processes is the dynamical structure factor . of particular interest in our case is the difference between bulk and surface behavior .",
    "therefore , we define a one - dimensional structure factor along the interface : s^(k_y , x , t)=    @xmath89 are the coordinates of lattice site @xmath19 .",

    "figure [ figstruct ] shows plots of this quantity for different times .",
    "we observe the characteristic cahn - hilliard behavior : in the beginning , linear superposition is valid , and the structure factor for each mode grows exponentially with a growth rate depending on @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , all the structure factor curves intersect in one point , corresponding to the marginally stable mode . at later times , the nonlinear terms in the equations of motion couple the different modes , and the shape of the structure factor curve changes , as can be noted at the last time for the surface layer .",
    "the two sets of curves have very different amplitudes , and the maximum is located at @xmath91 at the surface , and at @xmath92 in the bulk .",
    "these differences between bulk and surface behavior will be addressed in sec .",

    "the interface is still present and leads to a destabilization of the first layer of the minority component , which disintegrates into regularly spaced droplets .",
    "these droplets coarsen rapidly .",
    "this time , there is no mullins - sekerka instability with respect to the vacancies , because the formation of the first decomposed layer rapidly blocks the exchange of vacancies between the interior of the sample and the vapor .",
    "inside the sample , the surface - induced wave travels until the bulk modes reach their nonlinear regime .",
    "there is a competition of droplet and stripe patterns during the subsequent coarsening process .",
    "the droplets in the interior of the sample coarsen more rapidly than the stripes at the surface , not surprisingly as the driving force for the evaporation - condensation mechanism of coarsening is the curvature of the domain walls . ultimately , the stripes start to break up and are `` infected '' by the droplet pattern .    a simulation for a `` droplet '' geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ figtarget ] .",
    "the obviously symmetric configuration of the outer domains of b - rich phase is due to the anisotropy of the surface tensions introduced by the lattice @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this effect is not immediately visible in the critical quenches .",
    "the symmetric configuration , however , is only transient : on the last snapshot picture , the smallest of the four outer b domains is about to evaporate .",

    "our simple model shows that this general behavior is also valid for free surfaces .    in 3d samples we also find fast surface modes , but because the vapor - mixture interface is now two - dimensional , the patterns occurring at the surface for critical quenches are those of 2d bulk spinodal decomposition ( fig .",
