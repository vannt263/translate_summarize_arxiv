    "the description of the gravitational interaction can be done in different ways , the main and best known is that using riemannian geometry as a tool for the formulation of this description .",
    "this is known as the theory of general relativity ( gr ) of einstein @xcite .",
    "the riemannian geometry is based on the differential geometry which deals with the so - called space - time as a differentiable manifold of dimension four , where we have only the effect of the curvature .",
    "there are other geometries that generalize this idea .",
    "a space - time may have curvature , but also torsion in their structure .",
    "there are two fundamental concepts in differential geometry .",
    "the formulation of this type of geometry has been undertaken and gravitation is known as einstein - cartan geometry @xcite . in this theory the gravitational interaction is described by both curvature and torsion of space - time , where the torsion is commonly attributed to the inclusion of spin , through fractional spin fields .",
    "a very particular case of this theory is when we take the identically zero curvature , and then only have a space - time with torsion .",
    "this type of geometry is known as the weitzenbock geometry @xcite , where the torsion describes the gravitational interaction .",
    "various analysis can be performed in this type of geometry , which is proven to be dynamically equivalent to gr @xcite . in this context , recently a new formulation is started up , and generalizes the call teleparallel theory ( tt ) , of the space - time where the gravitational interaction is described solely by the torsion .    through",
    "the standard big bang @xcite theory , the @xmath0cdm models describe very well the evolution of our universe , in a riemannian geometry within the gr .",
    "there are several open issues , but the main one today is the so - called dark energy . in order to make the cosmological wmap data fitting with the theory ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce an exotic component in the equations of gr , i.e , the dark energy .",
    "this can be modelled as a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath14 , where the values of @xmath15 must be very close to the @xmath16 today .",
    "an alternative to that data , being consistent with the theory , is the modification of the geometry .",
    "a good review can be seen in @xcite .",
    "one of the first general possibilities is the well known @xmath17 theory @xcite , where @xmath18 is the scalar curvature , obtained through the double contraction of the riemann tensor indices .",
    "this theory places the analytic function @xmath17 in the action , where the gr can be reobtained in a certain limit , such as from @xmath19 , with @xmath20 one gets again gr .",
    "this theory has proved effective in simulating the evolution of our universe , in various epochs .",
    "other possibilities have arisen through the generalisation of the gr , by changing the action .",
    "one such change is the case of @xmath21 theory , where @xmath3 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor . in this case , the matter content should be taken into account as having a kind of interaction with the geometry .",
    "a direct analogy could be made between theories with only the curvature and the torsion only .",
    "as the @xmath17 theory is a generalization of the gr , it is logic to also think of a generalization of the tt , where the analogous object to the riemannian scalar curvature , is the torsion scalar @xmath2 , obtained from contractions between the torsion and contorsion tensors .",
    "a change in the action of tt is made considering an analytic function @xmath8 which depends on the torsion scalar .",
    "that was first thought of a theory arising from the born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "then , several studies have shown the great accordance of this theory with the most varied approaches in gravitation and cosmology @xcite .",
    "another recent proposal is to consider not only the torsion scalar in the action , but also the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , as an analogy to the @xmath22 theory .",
    "this theory , called @xmath23 has been formulated recently @xcite , still requiring verification of compatibility with the cosmological data and the physical requirements for a good cosmological theory .",
    "that is the reason to check how should be the functional form of the action of this theory , such that the @xmath0cdm model is valid . for this",
    "we use the scheme the reconstruction method for a modified gravity @xcite .",
    "in addition , we make a stability analysis for the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "it also exists a wide interest in studying the thermodynamics of our universe .",
    "various calculus have been done for guaranteeing the system to obey the first and second laws of thermodynamics . in the gr",
    ", it has been shown that the first law of thermodynamics can be shown as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this law can also be represented in the modified versions of gravity , but with an additive content of entropy production , for a non - equilibrium description @xcite .",
    "we have done here an analysis which yields the conditions for satisfying the classical thermodynamics laws .",
    "we adopt the units as @xmath25 and the newton constant @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we make a brief description of @xmath27 and @xmath28 theories , with the main elements and definitions necessary for their formulation . in section [ sec2.1 ]",
    "we have analysed the conservation of energy - momentum tensor , * which results in strong constraints to the functional form of the action of the theory , leading to function @xmath28 with a linear dependence on the trace @xmath3*. in the [ sec3 ] section , we use the reconstruction method for the actions to obtain the @xmath0cdm model for @xmath28 theory . *",
    "the result shows that the action of @xmath0cdm is a combination of a linear term , a constant ( @xmath4 ) and a non - linear term given by the product @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath6 being a generic function*. in section [ sec4 ] we make the stability analysis of the studied model . * the model present stability within the geometric and matter perturbations for the choice @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , except for geometric part to de sitter model*. we do a thermodynamic analysis for @xmath1 theory in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "* we impose the first and second laws of thermodynamics to the @xmath0cdm and find the condition where they are satisfied , that is , @xmath13 , however where this is not possible for cases where we choose , leading to a breakdown of positive entropy and misner - sharp energy*. in section [ sec5.1 ] we have established the conservation of energy - momentum tensor to previous results , * showing an inconsistency for this approach*. we make our final considerations in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "in this section we will see the basic preliminary concepts for the reconstruction of theories @xmath8 and @xmath28 theories of gravity .    in theory",
    "@xmath8 , the geometry is determined solely by the matrices that transform the metric of space - time into the minkowski metric . to begin , we define the space - time as a differentiable manifold in which only the torsion is non - zero , that is , the curvature is identically zero , then all riemann tensor components are zero .",
    "now we define the line element as @xmath29 taking into account that we can define 1-forms in the co - tangent space of the manifold , and introduce lorentz symmetry in the line element , we can re - write the line element as @xmath30 where @xmath31 are 1-forms , index @xmath32 and @xmath33=diag[1,-1,-1,-1]$ ] is the minkowski metric . here",
    "the latin indices are related to the co - tangent space and the greeks ones to the space - time . by the way of writting the line element ( [ metric ] )",
    ", we can establish the following relations @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the inverse of matrix called tetrad @xmath39 .",
    "the connection is chosen such that all the riemann tensor components are identically zero , and one has the weitzenbock connection @xcite @xmath40 we can now define a tensor which gives sense of torsion to the space - time @xmath41 through the components of the torsion tensor , we can define the contortion tensor components and the tensor @xmath42 @xmath43 we can also define the analogous object to the scalar curvature in gr , the torsion scalar @xmath44 it is this object that plays the curvature scalar role in gr , and that should also form the action of @xmath8 theory . the action of @xmath8 theory is constructed in a way that we have a linear term in the torsion scalar , another containing the correction term to the tt and another term related to the material content .",
    "then we write the action as @xmath45,\\label{actionft},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 = \\sqrt{-g}=\\sqrt{det[g_{\\mu\\nu}]}$ ] , @xmath47 the newton s constant , and setting @xmath48 to unity . in @xmath27",
    "theory , tetrads are dynamic fields , then doing the functional variation of the action ( [ actionft ] ) in relation to them , one gets the following equations of motion @xmath49   + e_a^{\\;\\;\\sigma}s_{\\sigma}^{\\;\\;\\nu\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}{t } f_{tt}+\\frac{1}{4 } e _ { a}^{\\;\\;\\nu}[t+f ] = 4\\pi ge_{a}^{\\sigma}\\theta_{\\sigma}^{\\;\\;\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the nomenclature @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 represents the components of the matter energy - momentum tensor .",
    "let s take the example of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe with flat spatial section @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the scale factor .",
    "the hubble parameter is given by @xmath55 .",
    "now we specify our choice of tetrads as @xmath56=diag[1,a(t),a(t),a(t)].\\ ] ] with this choice , we can represent the line element ( [ metric ] ) through a set of 1-forms @xmath57 @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "thus , the equations of motion ( [ eqm1 ] ) for @xmath8 theory , taking the material content as a perfect fluid @xmath59 $ ] , are given as follows @xmath60 the subscribed @xmath61 and @xmath62 means the density and pressure of the total matter in the universe , we consider here only the components of the baryonic matter as @xmath63 and radiation as @xmath64 .    here , the torsion scalar is obtained by the definitions ( [ torsion])-([storsion ] ) with ( [ tetrad1 ] ) , resulting in @xmath65 we now see clearly that the equations of motion of @xmath8 theory are identical to that of the gr , and the equations of friedmann ( flat spatial section ) , when the nonlinear term are zero , i.e making @xmath66 in ( [ eqm2 - 1])-([eqm2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "now we can present the most recent generalization of the @xmath8 theory .",
    "following the analogy of the generalization of the @xmath17 theory to @xmath21 , where @xmath3 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor . here",
    ", we can also introduce in the action an analytic function that depends not only on the torsion scalar , but also on the trace @xmath3 .",

    "here we must consider that the lagrangian density @xmath70 depends only on tetrads and not on its derivatives .",
    "for the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid we have the following trace @xmath71 we can then make the functional variation of the action ( [ action2 ] ) with respect to the tetrads , resulting in the following equations of motion @xcite @xmath72   + \\left(f_{tt } \\partial_{\\mu}{t}+f_{t\\mathcal{t } } \\partial_{\\mu } \\mathcal{t}\\right ) e^{\\;\\;\\alpha}_{a } s_{\\alpha}^{\\;\\;\\sigma \\mu } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + e_{a}^{\\;\\;\\sigma } \\left(\\frac{f+t}{4}\\right )   -f_{\\mathcal{t } } \\left(\\frac{e^{\\;\\;\\alpha}_{a } \\theta_{\\alpha}^{\\;\\;\\sigma}+p_m e^{\\;\\;\\sigma}_{a}}{2}\\right)=4\\pi g e^{\\;\\;\\alpha}_{a } \\theta_{\\alpha}^{\\;\\;\\sigma},\\label{eqm } \\label{eqm3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . here",

    "this section is devoted to establishing a conservation law for the @xmath1 theory .",

    "already through the first constraint , if we are to maintain the conservation of energy - momentum tensor , we must impose @xmath93 , as usually obtained in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this provides us @xmath94    when we do the same analysis in @xmath92 gravity , we also have a restriction on the functional form of the action @xcite .    we will guard these results and reconstruct the @xmath0cdm model taking into account these two constraint .",
    "in this section we use the reconstruction method , through a particular model , for obtaining what should be the functional form of the function @xmath1 . this method",

    "it is still some important observations .",
    "our model is able to reproduce well the eras that the evolution of our universe goes . for exemple , with the imposition ( [ lcdm ] )",
    "we see daily that the era of radiation , where we write now @xmath107 , and of the matter , where @xmath108 , are now well reproduced . in radiation era , as the term of the radiation density dominates over the matter term , the generic function is being approximated by @xmath109 $ ] . already in the matter era , as now the dominant term is the matter density , we have the same functional form of the action ( [ action3 ] ) . in the dark energy era , it s approach @xmath110 , or equivalently @xmath111 , which brings us to the same functional form of radiation era for @xmath6 , but now @xmath112 . here",
    "inflation can be described similarly , whereas the component that dominates is the vacuum energy density .    *",
    "as seen , our reconstruction is compatible with the most varied eras of cosmological evolution of our universe , leading us to believe that this model should also be compatible with the cosmological experimental data .",
    "we know at least that the acceleration of the universe at this stage is consistent with our model , for the very reconstruction is done to satisfy this condition .",
    "and we still have compatibility with the measures of type ia sn , where @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "we can at least see that there is a compatibility with ultra - stiff fluid where @xmath114 , made in a recent analysis @xcite .",
    "*    one last important observation is that for the reconstruction satisfy the first constraint ( [ eqnonconserv1.1 ] ) , we have to fix the trace in terms of torsion scalar as follows @xmath115\\label{tcal}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows us that the validity of the reconstruction of the @xmath0cdm model is subject to a fixation of the energy - momentum tensor trace , given in ( [ tcal ] ) .",
    "this show us that the @xmath1 theory should always be considered a theory in which the trace of energy - momentum tensor depends linearly on the torsion scalar .",
    "however , this does not permit us to conclude that the @xmath1 gravity must always fall back on @xmath8 gravity , because for what @xmath1 fall back in @xmath8 , it is necessary that @xmath9 in ( [ flcdm ] ) , and does not have a linear dependence on the trace , as we have here .",
    "* it may be possible to escape from the result that the action should have linear dependence on the trace @xmath3 , which is a direct implication of the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor given in .",
    "we can think about the possibility of non - conservation of energy - momentum tensor , arising from the non - minimal coupling between matter and torsion , similar to the case of theories modified only curvature @xcite .",
    "this should be interpreted as a possibility that the movement of the material content is not more geodesic having the appearance of an extra force term .",
    "this can also come to modify the bending of light and add a term in acceleration exerted by gravity , astrophysical implications may have to help in models of dark matter .",
    "this approach goes beyond our analysis here and should be done in future work . *    in the next section , we will show the stability of the @xmath0cdm model reconstructed here .",

    "the graphical representation to @xmath132 in figure [ fig1 ] shows that despite this function quickly drop to zero , the initial values are of the order to @xmath144 , thus contradicting the initial assumption for perturbation which is @xmath145 .",
    "this shows us an impossibility for stability to the model of de sitter , due precisely to the initial values for perturbation of the geometric part .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     so we can conclude that this type of behavior suggests ( it we have not tested all possibilities of cases ) that the @xmath1 gravity , does not have a well - established thermodynamic with all the thermodynamic quantities physical well - defined every time interval .",
    "we will impose the second law of thermodynamics to @xmath1 .",
    "to do so , let us consider the gibbs equation in terms of matter fluid and total energy given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the temperature and total entropy associated to the system , respectively . according to the second law of thermodynamics , we must have @xmath149 knowing that @xmath150 and using ( [ firstlaw ] ) and ( [ gibbs ] ) we can write the left side of ( [ 2lt ] ) as @xmath151\\,.\\label{2lt2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath152 , using ( [ de2 ] ) and @xmath153 we get , for ( [ 2lt2 ] ) , @xmath154 with @xmath155 , as previously done .",
    "the observation is that the temperature of the apparent horizon in ( [ temp ] ) , depends on the components of the universe , through ( [ de1 ] ) and ( [ de2 ] ) , including the photons of cmb with @xmath156 .",

    "are the expressions of the second law similar to particular cases , or analogs @xmath8 and @xmath92 , but we are still restricted to the problem of the previous section , in which we can not set @xmath157 always positive , which leads to a possibility of negative entropy , which is physically inconsistent for the cases studied here .",
    "we noticed a great need to compare our results with the first work in this extension of the @xmath8 gravity .",
    "the observation that we have done here is that the first construction of @xmath1 theory has been done by kiani and nozari @xcite . but do to the ambiguity of the choice of the lagrangian density for the perfect fluid , with the lagrangian density being @xmath158 ( our choice ) or @xmath159 ( see @xcite ) , they use the last description .",
    "this conduces to a new approach possibly equivalent to the same theory .",
    "they make an analysis of the stability for the de sitter model , but as they did not reconstruct the action , they considered the model as a generic one @xmath160",
    ".    here we will verify the consistency of this approach to the conservation of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "taking the equation of motion ( 11 ) in @xcite , considering ( 13 ) , we multiply by @xmath161 and considering the identity @xmath162=(1/2)[g_{\\nu}^{\\;\\;\\mu}-(1/2)\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}t]$ ] , we have @xmath163 now we take the total divergence @xmath164 of the above equation of motion , and isolating @xmath85 , taking into account that @xmath86 , we have the following result @xmath165\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(f_{tt}\\partial_{\\mu}t+f_{t\\mathcal{t}}\\partial_{\\mu}\\mathcal{t}\\right)\\left(g_{\\nu}^{\\;\\;\\mu}-\\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}t\\right)+\\frac{1}{4}f_{\\mathcal{t}}\\partial_{\\nu}\\mathcal{t}+\\frac{3}{2}\\big[f_{\\mathcal{t}}\\partial_{\\nu}\\rho_{mt}+\\rho_{mt}\\left(f_{t\\mathcal{t}}\\partial_{\\nu}t+f_{\\mathcal{t}\\mathcal{t}}\\partial_{\\nu}\\mathcal{t}\\right)\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{5}{4}\\left(f_{t\\mathcal{t}}\\partial_{\\mu}t+f_{\\mathcal{t}\\mathcal{t}}\\partial_{\\mu}\\mathcal{t}\\right)\\theta_{\\nu}^{\\;\\;\\mu}\\bigg\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then arise two constraint here , one for @xmath88 and outher for @xmath89 , @xmath166\\frac{dt}{dt}+\\left[\\rho_{mt}f_{\\mathcal{t}\\mathcal{t}}+f_{\\mathcal{t}}+12(1-h^2)f_{t\\mathcal{t}}\\right]\\frac{d\\mathcal{t}}{dt}+6f_{\\mathcal{t}}\\dot{\\rho}_{mt}\\right\\}\\label{nonconservkiani1}\\,,\\\\ 0&=&3(h^2-a)\\left[f_{tt}\\frac{dt}{dt}+f_{t\\mathcal{t}}\\frac{d\\mathcal{t}}{dt}\\right]\\label{nonconservkiani2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second constraint is satisfied , in general , to @xmath167 , fixing function @xmath1 as a linear function on the torsion scalar @xmath2 .",
    "this returns to a trace coupling with teleparallel theory , which is not the intention here .",
    "thus , the description of the theory as shown in @xcite , is not consistent with the conservation of energy - momentum tensor presented here .",
    "we must then discard here that description by the density of the fluid .",
    "an important observation is that this result does not mean that the description of lagrangian fluid through the density is incorrect , but that the specific choice of the set of diagonal tetrad , @xmath168=[1,a(t),a(t),a(t)]$ ] , is that it can not provide a consistent result .",
    "it should be investigated in another future work , as well as consistency between two description possibilities , one by density and the other by fluid pressure .",
    "the @xmath23 theory can be a good opportunity to test whether we can describe the dark energy by changing the tt equations of motion . to do this , it is first necessary to test the most common models of modern cosmology , the famous @xmath0cdm one for exemple .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath169cdm model gives rise to an action as combination of a linear term in the torsion scalar , a constant ( @xmath170 ) and another , which is the interaction between matter and torsion , described by the product @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "this reconstruction decays in the @xmath27 theory , by appropriately choosing the @xmath171 , with @xmath10 a constant given in @xcite .",
    "this reconstruction severely restricted the functional form of action , but well reproduces the cosmological eras .",
    "* we do the analysis of the energy - momentum tensor conservation through the obtained reconstruction model , resulting in the function @xmath103 $ ] must be linear in its argument , so that conservation is satisfied as the usual @xmath0cdm model . with this action",
    "should not contain terms of higher orders and is restricted to linearity in the trace @xmath3 .",
    "this model does not prevent accordance with observational data , and for the particular case of ultra - stiff fluid , where @xmath114 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "*    we have done the analysis of the stability of this model , for a particular choice @xmath11 , and we found that the model is stable for de sitter and power law solutions , except for geometric part to de sitter one .",
    "we finish analysing the thermodynamics for the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we find that the imposition of the thermodynamic laws are satisfied for the conditions @xmath13 , which can not be met for the analysis here .",
    "we found an impossibility to define positive entropy and misner - sharp energy in any interval of physical time , as well as prevent ghost structure in the quantized theory @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the cosmological thermodynamic theory to @xmath172 may not be well established fundamentally .",
    "we use here the reconstruction method to cosmological models , which can then be examined reconstruction to other known models like holographic and chaplygin gas for example .",
    "these new approaches can not modify the main result of the energy - momentum tensor conservation , the action is linear in the trace @xmath3 , more should cooperate with the acceleration of the universe at this stage .",
    "this will be covered in detail in a next work .",
    "another possibility approach is when we consider the space - time connection , regardless of the set of tetrads , then one of the dynamic fields .",
    "that would be a new version of @xmath1 cosmology in the palatini s formalism , which may reveal new results in the reconstruction of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this approach can also reveal a different constraint to the conservation of energy tensor - momentum .",
    "using the formalism reconstruction from the lqc model , as seen in @xcite , we can generalize to a non - minimum coupling with the matter .",
    "we see in @xcite the reconstruction by an inverse method considering also @xmath173 or yet @xmath174 , what is obtained in terms of the torsion scalar on",
