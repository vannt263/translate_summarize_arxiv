    "<S> , @xmath4 follows kolmgorov s spectrum with a constant energy flux . </S>",

    "<S> buoyancy or density gradient drives flows in the atmosphere and interiors of planets and stars , as well as in electronic devices and industrial applications like heat exchangers , boilers , etc . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , scientists ( including geo- , astro- , atmospheric- and solar physicists ) and engineers have been working on understanding buoyancy driven flows for more than a century . an important unsolved problem in this field is how to quantify the spectra and fluxes of kinetic energy ( ke ) and entropy ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the velocity and temperature fluctuations ) of buoyancy driven flows  @xcite . in this letter , we will study these quantities and respective nonlinear fluxes using direct numerical simulations , and show that the spectrum differs from kolmogorov s theory when buoyancy is strong .    flows driven by buoyancy can be classified in two categories : ( a ) convective flows in which hotter and lighter fluid at the bottom rises , while colder and heavier fluid at the top comes down . </S>",
    "<S> these flows are unstable ; ( b ) stably stratified flows in which lighter fluid rests above heavier fluid . </S>",
    "<S> stably stratified flows are stable , hence their fluctuations vanish over time . therefore , they need to be driven by an external force to obtain a steady turbulent state . </S>",
