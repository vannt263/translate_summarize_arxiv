    "<S> given the existing empirical information about the exotic @xmath0 baryon , we analyze possible properties of its @xmath1-partners , paying special attention to the nonstrange member of the antidecuplet @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the modified @xmath3 partial - wave analysis presents two candidate masses , 1680  mev and 1730  mev . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath2 should be rather narrow and highly inelastic . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest several directions for experimental studies that may clarify properties of the antidecuplet baryons , and structure of their mixing with other baryons . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental evidence from the graal and star collaborations could be interpreted as observations of a candidate for the @xmath0 nonstrange partner .    .    </S>",
    "<S> results from a wide range of recent experiments are consistent with the existence of an exotic s=+1 resonance , the @xmath4 with a narrow width and a mass near 1540  mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct width determinations have been hindered by the limitations of experimental resolution , resulting in upper bounds of order 10  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum numbers of this state remain unknown , though a prediction of @xmath5 = @xmath6 was obtained in the work  @xcite that provided motivation for the original search .    </S>",
    "<S> additional information related to the assignment of unitary partners is due to a recent experimental result  @xcite giving evidence for one further explicitly exotic particle @xmath7 , with a mass @xmath8  mev and width @xmath9  mev ( _ i.e. _ less than resolution ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a particle had been expected to exist as a member of an antidecuplet , together with the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the soliton calculation of the mass difference requires some assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it depends on the value of the @xmath10-term , which is the subject of controversy . </S>",
    "<S> its value , taken according to the latest @xmath3 data analysis  @xcite , leads to an antidecuplet mass difference of about 110  mev , instead of the originally predicted 180  mev   @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , if the states @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12 are indeed members of the same antidecuplet , then , according to the gell - mann - okubo rule , the mass difference of any two neighboring isospin multiplets in the antidecuplet should be constant and equal @xmath13 which fits the gw said @xmath10-term result very well  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shift also effects the masses of other unitary partners of the @xmath0 : nucleon - like and @xmath14-like . </S>",
    "<S> the supposed antidecuplet , with @xmath14- and @xmath15-masses determined by the gell - mann  </S>",
    "<S> okubo rule , looks today as shown on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g1 ] .    due to @xmath1-violating mixing with lower - lying nucleon - like octet states , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 may shift upward , and reach about 1680  mev  @xcite . mixing with higher - lying nucleon - like members of exotic 27- and 35-plets </S>",
    "<S> may also play a role .    </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath17 , though listed in the pdg baryon summary table  @xcite as a 3-star resonance and used as input in the @xmath0 prediction  @xcite , is not seen in the latest analysis of pion - nucleon elastic scattering data ( see table  [ tbl : tbl1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> studies which have claimed to see this state have given widely varying estimates of its mass and width ( from @xmath18  mev to @xmath19  mev for the mass and from @xmath20  mev to @xmath21  mev for the width ) . </S>",
    "<S> branching ratios have also been given with large uncertainties ( 1020% for @xmath22 , 4090% for @xmath23 , and so on ) , apart from one which has been presented with much greater precision ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in any case , the pdg width of @xmath17 seems to be too large for the partner of the narrow @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it would be more natural for members of the same unitary multiplet to have comparable widths .    as has been suggested recently ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , any standard pwa by itself tends to miss narrow resonances . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we considered  @xcite a modified pwa , assuming the existence of a narrow resonance , and compared the quality of fit with and without such structures ( more detailed description of formulas see in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach was used initially to look for light nucleon resonances  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this method , applied to studies of the @xmath4   @xcite , though unable to determine the @xmath0 quantum numbers , placed a tight limit on the width , in full agreement with the results of other approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently used this method  @xcite to search @xmath3 scattering data for a narrow nucleon - like state assumed to be a member of the antidecuplet , accompanying the @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the two candidate masses , m@xmath26 = 1680  mev and 1730  mev , would necessary be quite inelastic with @xmath27 0.5  mev and 0.3  mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> some support for a narrow structure in this mass region has recently been obtained in a preliminary report based on direct measurements by the star  @xcite and graal  @xcite collaborations .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that there have been other publications finding no evidence for the existance of the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings need more detailed consideration . </S>",
    "<S> though the present non - observation data require some suppression of exotic production , as compared to conventional hadrons , they do not definitively exclude the existence of the @xmath0 and/or its companions / analogs . </S>",
    "<S> for example , analysis of the bes data  @xcite in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows that indeed there is some suppression of @xmath28-production . </S>",
    "<S> however , suppression of the exotics at this level could have a quite natural explanation .    </S>",
    "<S> there is also a statement that the observed peak of @xmath0 could be due to a kinematical reflection of some of known resonances . </S>",
    "<S> a particular consideration has been suggested by dzierba _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite addressed to the clas analysis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the specific model used by dzierba _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ has , however , been criticized  @xcite , and may not be a serious concern for the clas results .    </S>",
    "<S> we should emphasize here that if the present evidence for the @xmath28 turns out to be incorrect , we would have to answer a different , but also difficult , question : why do we _ not _ see exotic hadrons ? </S>",
    "<S> we take here , for the sake of argument , the position that the @xmath28 does exist , but its production is governed by different mechanisms . though we essentially agree with suggestions of karliner and lipkin  @xcite about how to clarify the problem , we think that , first of all , it is especially important to reliably confirm the existence of the @xmath28 in the processes where it has been reported . </S>",
    "<S> new data are being collected for this purpose , by several collaborations , and one would hope for a definitive answer within a year .    that is why , at the moment , we will assume the @xmath0 ( as well as other multi - quark hadrons ) being existent , and will discuss some consequences of this fact ( for details , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> given our current knowledge of the @xmath0 , the state commonly known as the @xmath17 is not the appropriate candidate to be a member of the antidecuplet together with the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we suggest candidates with nearby masses , @xmath29 ( more promising ) and/or @xmath30 ( less promising , but not excluded ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that the appropriate state should be rather narrow and very inelastic . </S>",
    "<S> similar considerations have been applied to the @xmath31 , assumed to be also a member of the same antidecuplet . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be quite narrow .    </S>",
    "<S> how reliable are our theoretical predictions ? </S>",
    "<S> they have , indeed , essential theoretical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we have yet to establish the existence of the ( narrow ) state originally associated with the @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have assumed the presence of only one state with @xmath32 , either @xmath29 or @xmath30 . if both exist with the same spin and parity , </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions should be reconsidered .    </S>",
    "<S> futhermore , we use the mixing angle @xmath33 , taken from ref .  @xcite , which was actually determined through formulas containing the @xmath10-term ( just as the mass difference in the antidecuplet ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we use parameters corresponding to more recent information , for both the @xmath10-term and the mass difference , we obtain larger mixing , up to @xmath34 . with our formulas </S>",
    "<S> , this would most strongly influence the partial width @xmath35 , increasing it to about 15  mev . </S>",
    "<S> other partial widths of @xmath36 change not so dramatically , and the total width appears to remain not higher than @xmath37  mev </S>",
    "<S> . such a width could well be measured , but not in elastic scattering , because of an expected very small elastic branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the above large value for @xmath38 may appear problematic , since the formulas of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite assume linearisation with respect to @xmath1-violation , and need to be reconsidered if the violation appears to be large .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , even having in mind all theoretical uncertainties , we can suggest several directions for experimental studies . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , one should search for possible new narrow nucleon state(s ) in the mass region near 1700  mev . </S>",
    "<S> searches may use various initial states , ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath3 collision or photoproduction ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the largest effect in the @xmath39 final state ( mainly through @xmath40 , though it is forbidden by @xmath1 ) . the final states @xmath41 and @xmath42 may also be interesting and useful , especially the ratio of @xmath41 and @xmath3 partial widths , as the latter is very sensitive to the structure of the octet  antidecuplet mixing . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting possibility to separate antidecuplet and octet components of @xmath2 is provided by comparison of photoexcitation amplitudes for neutral and charged isocomponents of this resonance , the point being that the antidecuplet component contribution to the photoexitation of the charged @xmath2 is strongly suppressed ( see details in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , such a relatively simple picture of mixing can not reproduce our small value(s ) of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed in our analysis that this could result from more complicated mixing with several other multiplets  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a possibility was recently confurmed  @xcite .    for @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , attempts to measure the total width are necessary , though it could possibly be even smaller than @xmath44 . branching ratios for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in relation to @xmath47 , are very interesting . </S>",
    "<S> these may give important information on the mixing of antidecuplet baryons with octets and higher @xmath1-multiplets .      </S>",
    "<S> the work was partly supported by the u.  s.  department of energy grant de  </S>",
