    "we have discussed two different optimization procedures : the maximization of the teleportation fidelity of the state , and the optimization of the teleportation of average values and variances of the field quadratures .",
    "the first procedure maximizes the similarity in phase space between the teleported and the input state , while the second one maximizes the preservation at the output of the displacement and squeezing contents of the input .",
    "we have shown that optimized non - gaussian entangled resources such as the squeezed bell states , as well as other more conventional non - gaussian entangled resources , such as the two - mode squeezed photon - subtracted states , outperform , in the realistic intervals of the squeezing parameter @xmath39 of the entangled resource achievable with the current technology , entangled gaussian resources both for the maximization of the teleportation fidelity and for the maximal preservation of the input squeezing and statistical moments .",
    "these findings are consistent and go in line with previous results on the improvement of various quantum information protocols replacing gaussian with suitably identified non - gaussian resources @xcite . in the process",
    ", we have found that the two optimal values of the resource angle @xmath38 associated with the two optimization procedures are different and identified , respectively , by eqs .",
    "( [ deltaoptfid ] ) and ( [ deltaoptvar ] ) .",
    "this inequivalence is connected to the fact that , when using entangled non - gaussian resources with free parameters that are amenable to optimization , the fidelity is closely related to the form of the different input properties that one wishes to teleport , e.g.  quasi - probability distribution in the phase space , squeezing , statistical moments of higher order , and so on .",
    "different quantities correspond to different optimal teleportation strategies .",
    "finally , regarding the vbk protocol , it is worth remarking that the maximization of the teleportation fidelity corresponds to the maximization of the squared modulus of the overlap between the input and the output ( teleported ) state , without taking into account the characteristics of the output with respect to the input state .",
    "therefore , part of the non - gaussian character of the entangled resource is unavoidably transferred to the output state .",
    "the latter then acquires unavoidably a certain degree of non - gaussianity , even if the presence of pure gaussian inputs .",
    "moreover , as verified in the case of non - ideal protocols , the output state is also strongly affected by decoherence .",
    "thus , in order to recover the purity and the gaussianity of the teleported state , purification and gaussification protocols should be implemented serially after transmission through the teleportation channel is completed @xcite . if the second ( squeezing preserving ) procedure is instead considered , the possible deformation of the gaussian character is not so relevant , because the shape reproduction is not the main goal , while purification procedures are again needed to correct for the extra noise added during teleportation when finite entanglement and realistic conditions are considered .",
    "an important open problem is determining a proper teleportation benchmark for the class of gaussian input states with unknown displacement and squeezing .",
    "such a benchmark is expected to be certainly smaller than @xmath134 in terms of teleportation fidelity , the latter being the benchmark for purely coherent input states with completely random displacement in phase space @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that optimized non - gaussian entangled resources will allow one to beat the classical benchmark , thus achieving unambiguous quantum state transmission via a truly quantum teleportation , with a smaller amount of nonclassical resources , such as squeezing and entanglement , compared to the case of shared gaussian twin beam resources . in this context ,",
    "[ fig1sfid ] provides strong and encouraging evidence that suitable uses of non - gaussianity in tailored resources , feasible with current technology @xcite , may lead to a genuine demonstration of cv quantum teleportation of displaced squeezed states in realistic conditions of the experimental apparatus .",
    "this would constitute a crucial step forward after the successful recent experimental achievement of the quantum storage of a displaced squeezed thermal state of light into an atomic ensemble memory @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the european union under the fp7 strep project hip ( hybrid information processing ) , grant agreement no .",
    "here we report the characteristic functions for the single - mode input states and for the two - mode entangled resources .",
    "the characteristic function for the coherent squeezed states ( [ cohsqueezst ] ) , i.e.  @xmath135 reads : @xmath136 the characteristic function for the squeezed bell - like resource ( [ squeezbell ] ) , i.e.  @xmath137 reads : @xmath138 \\ , , \\end{split } \\label{charfuncsb}\\ ] ] where the complex variables @xmath139 are defined as : @xmath140 it is worth noticing that , for @xmath41 , eq .  ( [ charfuncsb ] ) reduces to the well - known gaussian characteristic function of the twin beam . given the characteristic functions for the single - mode the input state and for the two - mode entangled resource , eqs .",
    "( [ chiinput ] ) and ( [ charfuncsb ] ) , respectively , it is straightforward to obtain the characteristic function for the single - mode output state of the teleportation protocol by using eq .",
    "( [ chioutfinale ] ) and replacing @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "in this appendix , we report the analytical expressions for the mean values @xmath97 $ ] , with @xmath98 @xmath99 , and the variances @xmath100 - { \\rm tr } [ z_j \\rho_{j } ] ^{2}$ ] of the quadrature operators @xmath103 , @xmath104 , associated with the single - mode input state @xmath49 and the output state @xmath11 of the teleportation protocol",
    ". we also compute the cross - quadrature variance @xmath101 - 2{\\rm tr } [ x_j \\rho_{j } ] { \\rm tr } [ p_j \\rho_{j } ] $ ] , associated with the non - diagonal term of the covariance matrix of the density operator , where the subscript @xmath102 denotes the symmetrization .",
