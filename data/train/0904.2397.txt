    "( n / s ) junctions , zero - bias conductance peaks ( zbcp)@xcite observed in high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) are explained as arising from the sign change of the pair potential , which leads to the formation of midgap surface states . replacing the normal metal by a ferromagnetic metal , the conductance spectrum is considerably changed due to the spin polarization caused by the exchange field .",
    "earlier works@xcite have demonstrated that the effect of the exchange energy is , in general , to reduce the andreev reflection ( ar ) at a ferromagnet / centrosymmetric superconductor ( fm / csc ) interface .",
    "so far , a variety of physical phenomena , including the effects of temperature,@xcite the planar magnetization components,@xcite and the fwm @xcite on the tunneling conductance and the proximity effect@xcite have been investigated .",
    "in particular , in refs . and the effect of the fwm was considered and it was found that in some cases the exchange energy can enhance andreev reflection .",
    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in the heavy fermion compound cept@xmath0si ( ref . ) has renewed interest , both experimental and theoretical , in the properties of superconductors without inversion symmetry .",
    "noncentrosymmetric superconductors ( ncscs ) exhibit a variety of distinctive features , which are absent in the centrosymmetric case , such as a strongly anisotropic spin susceptibility with a large residual component,@xcite magnetoelectric effect,@xcite and unusual nonuniform ( `` helical '' ) superconducting phases.@xcite the tunneling conductance in a normal metal / noncentrosymmetric superconductor ( n / ncsc ) junction has been recently studied in refs . .",
    "in these works , yokoyama _",
    "et al._@xcite found that an intrinsically @xmath1-wave - like property of a triplet ncsc results in a peak at the energy gap in the tunneling spectrum .",
    "et al._@xcite observed the zero - bias anomalies if a specific form of the mixed singlet - triplet order parameter was realized .",
    "_ @xcite found pronounced peaks and bumps in the conductance spectrum corresponding to the sum and difference of the magnitudes of the singlet and triplet gaps .",
    "one of the important questions is how the andreev reflection affects the tunneling conductance in the presence of _ both _ ferromagnetism and the rsoc .",
    "so far , there has been no theory for this phenomenon .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the tunneling spectroscopy of a ferromagnet / noncentrosymmetric superconductor ( fm / ncsc ) junction .",
    "we employ the well - known blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) formalism,@xcite but extend and generalize it to include the effects of the exchange energy ( some references called it spin polarization ) in the ferromagnet , the rsoc due to the lack of inversion symmetry , and the existence of fwm .",
    "we find many interesting features in the conductance spectrum , stemming from the interplay of magnetism and the rsoc .",
    "away from the gap edge , the tunneling conductance is enhanced as the rsoc decreases , while it is almost unchanged near the gap edge .",
    "this behavior is completely different from that found in the n / ncsc junction.@xcite the competition between the effects of the exchange energy and the rsoc on the ar leads to an enhanced subgap conductance , which can even result in a maximum at zero energy under certain conditions .",
    "in addition , we also show the importance of properly accounting for the fwm , namely , the conductance spectrum monotonically increase with the decreasing the fwm parameter in the whole excitation energy region , which is essentially different from the behaviour found in the fm / csc junctions.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we define the theoretical model and extend the btk approach to obtain the amplitudes for various scattering processes that occur in the fm / ncsc junction . in sec .",
    "iii , the corresponding numerical results for the tunneling conductance are presented and discussed .",
    "iv contains a summary of our results .",
    "we consider the tunneling conductance of the fm / ncsc junction as shown in fig .",

    "the fm is at @xmath2 , and is described by an effective single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "the ncsc is assumed to have purely singlet pairing , and is described by a bcs - like hamiltonian .",
    "the fm / ncsc interface is at @xmath3 , where there is interfacial scattering , which is modeled by a potential @xmath4 , with @xmath5 characterizing the barrier strength .",
    "the band dispersions are isotropic , and the effective masses of quasiparticles are assumed to be the same on both sides .",
    "the quasiparticle wave function satisfies the following bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 with the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath8 here @xmath9 represent the fermi energies in the fm and the ncsc region , respectively , @xmath10 for different spin orientations , @xmath11 is the exchange energy on the fm side ( we assume that the fm magnetization and the exchange energy are along the @xmath12 axis ) , @xmath13 is the antisymmetric ( rashba ) spin - orbit coupling on the sc side , and @xmath14 are the pauli matrices ( we use the units in which @xmath15 ) .    in our model , we consider a noncentrosymmetric superconductor with the tetragonal crystal symmetry , which is relevant for cept@xmath0si , cerhsi@xmath0 , and ceirsi@xmath0 .",

    "we also introduce the dimensionless parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 , characterizing the barrier strength and the magnitude of the rsoc , respectively .    by using the general btk formalism,@xcite",
    "we obtain for the dimensionless differential tunneling conductance : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the probability that an incident electron has spin @xmath63 ( @xmath64 because of the difference between the densities of states in the spin-@xmath35 and spin-@xmath37 bands , see ref . ) , @xmath65 is the tunneling conductance for a normal metal / normal metal junction , and @xmath66 is determined by the angle of total reflection ( critical angle ) for incident electron with spin @xmath63 . for an incoming electron with spin-@xmath35 , the critical angles for the andreev reflection and the transmission are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . when @xmath24 exceeds @xmath69 , the @xmath57-component of the wave vector in the ar process , @xmath70 , becomes purely imaginary so that the andreev - reflected quasiparticles do not contribute to the charge current , which can be referred to as the virtual ar .",
    "further , when @xmath71 , the transmitted quasiparticles with the wave vectors @xmath72 do not contribute to the conductance .",
    "the conductance for an electron with spin @xmath63 as a function of the excitation energy @xmath22 and the incident angle @xmath24 reads @xmath73 the ratios of @xmath74 on the right - hand side of this equation are obtained from the conservation of probability : @xmath75",
    "in this section , we present the results of numerical calculations for the conductance of the fm / ncsc junction at zero temperature , plotted as a function of the dimensionless quasiparticle energy @xmath76 .",

    "@xmath81 ( top panel ) , and @xmath82 ( bottom panel).,width=264 ]    we consider first the case in which there is no fermi - surface mismatch , i.e. @xmath91 and @xmath85 .",
    "2 displays the behavior of the tunneling conductance @xmath92 at a fixed small exchange energy value of @xmath84 , for several values of @xmath77 . in the absence of the interface barrier ( @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the results are shown in the top panel .",
    "one can see clearly that the curves there are similar to the well - known btk results ( ref . ) . in the btk model ,",
    "the conductance in the subgap region , @xmath93 , for the materials with @xmath94 is equal to 2 due to the andreev reflection .",
    "one can see that our curves in the top panel indeed approach this value ( and are all close to 2 at the gap edge , i.e. at @xmath95 ) . that the subgap conductance is slightly smaller than 2 can be attributed to the suppression of the andreev reflection due to the different densities of states in the spin - up and spin - down bands .",
    "the conductance at zero energy and also far away from the gap edge monotonically decreases with increasing the rsoc in the ncsc .",
    "this can be understood as follows : as @xmath77 increases , the transmitted waves with the wave vectors @xmath72 quickly become evanescent , since the angle of total reflection @xmath96 for the waves with @xmath72 decreases as @xmath77 increases .",
    "the eigenstates corresponding to such waves can no longer contribute to the conductance .",
    "in the bottom panel of fig .  2 , @xmath82 , the conductance curves display similar behavior , but with a stronger suppression of @xmath92 in the subgap region and a higher and sharper maximum at the gap edge @xmath97 .     versus the dimensionless energy @xmath83 for @xmath85 and different values of the exchange energy : @xmath84 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath98 .",

    "the variation of @xmath92 with @xmath100 is plotted for several values of @xmath101 . in a fm / csc junction",
    ", the conductance monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath101 ( refs . and ) , because of the reduction of the andreev reflection , when only a small fraction of injected electrons from the majority spin band can be reflected as holes belonging to the minority spin band .",
    "however , if the superconductor has no inversion symmetry , the fermi surface is split into two due to the spin - orbit coupling , thus making the conductance features more interesting . as seen clearly from the top ( @xmath99 ) and middle ( @xmath86 ) panels in fig .  3 , in the presence of the rsoc",
    ", the exchange energy can enhance the andreev reflection and therefore the subgap conductance in the region @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "this effect becomes more pronounced at @xmath86 , in which case the subgap conductance at @xmath104 is monotonically enhanced for all values of @xmath101 .",
    "the conductance can even have a maximum at @xmath104 at certain values of @xmath101 and @xmath77 .",
    "these features are quite different from those observed in the fm / csc junction where the peak stems from the interplay of the fwm and the exchange field.@xcite when the interfacial scattering is nonzero , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .  3",
    ", a rather sharp conductance peak appears at the gap edge .",
    "it becomes increasingly narrow as @xmath101 grows , due to the suppression of the andreev reflection .",
    "furthermore , the exchange energy dependence becomes weak in the region @xmath105 , and the conductance approaches its normal - state value @xmath106 ( ref . ) at higher excitation energies .     versus the dimensionless energy @xmath83 for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and different values of the fermi wave - vector mismatch parameter : @xmath85 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath81 ( top panel ) and @xmath82 ( bottom panel).,width=264 ]    we now turn to the effects of the fermi wave - vector mismatch , namely , @xmath112 , on the tunneling conductance .",
    "the difference of the fermi energies in the fm and ncsc regions results in some interesting features in the conductance spectrum . in fig .  4 , which shows the results at @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath81 ( top panel ) and @xmath82 ( bottom panel )",
    ", we consider the evolution of the conductance curves for several values of the fwm .",
    "one can easily see that the conductance is monotonically enhanced in the whole region of excitation energies as the fwm parameter @xmath79 decreases ( i.e. the difference between @xmath113 and @xmath114 increases ) , which is significantly different from the case of a fm / csc junction.@xcite this result can be explained by the fact that in the presence of the rsoc , a smaller @xmath79 will lead to the weaker ordinary scattering at the interface , which increases the andreev reflection .",
    "we would like to point out that in the absence of the rsoc , one can not obtain the monotonic increase of the conductance at all excitation energies by varying @xmath79 and/or @xmath115 .",
    "to summarize our results , we have investigated the tunneling conductance of the fm / ncsc junction with the help of the extended btk formalism .",
    "our results show a number of features in @xmath92 that are qualitatively different from the previously studied cases of n / ncsc and fm / csc junctions .",
    "these are caused by the interplay between the rashba spin - orbit coupling in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor , the exchange energy in the ferromagnet , and the fermi wave - vector mismatch between the two regions .    if the fermi energies in fm and ncsc regions are the same , then far from the gap edge the conductance is monotonically enhanced by introducing a small rsoc , while around the gap edge the conductance is almost independent of rsoc .",
    "in addition , the subgap conductance can be enhanced due to the interplay of the rsoc and the exchange energy , and can have a maximum at @xmath104 at certain values of @xmath77 and @xmath101 .",
    "the enhancement of the conductance is more pronounced at smaller @xmath77 , which is attributed to the increase in the andreev reflection by the small rsoc dominating the decrease due to the exchange energy .",
    "these phenomena are essentially different from those found in fm / csc junctions , where both the enhanced subgap conductance and its maximum arise from the effect of the fwm at a fixed exchange energy .",
    "we also considered the case of different fermi energies in the fm and ncsc regions .",
    "the tunneling conductance is quite sensitive to the fwm and displays a monotonic increase as the difference between the fermi energies increases , due to the suppressed ordinary scattering at the interface and enhanced andreev reflection .",
    "this behavior is also essentially different from that in fm / csc junctions .    as for the experimental situation , while we are not aware of any work done on fm / ncsc junctions , fm / csc junctions have been studied in refs . .",
    "in those works , the spin polarization of the current in the ferromagnet ( the transport spin polarization ) was determined by analysing the experimental data within the extended btk scheme , with the total current decomposed into an unpolarized and a fully polarized components .",
    "our model , which includes the rsoc , can also be used in the context of spin - polarized tunneling spectroscopy .",
