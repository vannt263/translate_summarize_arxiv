    "this article is about a classical problem in hyperbolic geometry and its analogue in graph theory . in the language of graph theory , this problem concerns the existence of regular graphs with large _ girth _ ( a graph is called @xmath1-regular if all of its vertices have degree @xmath1 ) . here , the girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle .",

    "surprisingly , it is actually possible to construct sequences of @xmath1-regular graphs with girth that grows logarithmically in the number of vertices .",
    "the first constructions of such graphs are due to erds and sachs @xcite and sauer @xcite , which provide graphs of girth roughly @xmath7 .",
    "the best known constructions have asymptotic girth @xmath8 as @xmath9",

    "these surfaces can be compactified , in essence by adding points in the cusps , in order to obtain closed surfaces . a result of brooks ( lemma [ lem_brooks ] ) implies that the systole of these compactified surfaces remains close to their cusped counterparts .",

    "in this section we explain how to construct a surface from a cubic ribbon graph and how the geometry of such a surface depends on the combinatorics of the underlying graph .",
    "the construction we use is taken from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we begin with the definition of a cubic ribbon graph :    a graph @xmath34 is called _ cubic _ if : @xmath35 a _",
    "cubic ribbon graph _ is a pair @xmath36 , where @xmath3 is a cubic graph and @xmath37 is a map that assigns a cyclic order to the triple of edges emanating from each vertex .",
    "ribbon graphs are sometimes called _ fatgraphs _ or _ oriented graphs_. it should be noted that these definitions do not distinguish between graphs and multigraphs : graphs in this text are allowed to have loops and multiple edges .",
    "given a cubic ribbon graph @xmath36 we construct a topological surface @xmath38 as follows . to every vertex @xmath39 of @xmath3 we assign a triangle , whose three sides correspond to the edges emanating from @xmath39",
    ". then , for each edge @xmath40 of @xmath3 , we glue together the two triangle sides corresponding to @xmath40 .",
    "we do this in such a way that the resulting surface is orientable .",
    "the orientation we pick is the one corresponding to the cyclic order on the edges emanating from each vertex ( eg . via the right - hand rule ) . in this way , the pair @xmath36 uniquely determines the surface @xmath38 .",
    "we observe that the graph @xmath3 naturally embeds into the surface @xmath38 , and we will often think of it as such without mention . in this setting the combinatorics of the underlying graph can be used to control the topology of the surface ; for example , the following result of beineke and harary bounds the genus of @xmath38 using solely combinatorial data :    @xcite[prp_graphgen ] let @xmath3 be a connected graph with @xmath41 vertices , @xmath42 edges and girth @xmath43 that embeds into a surface @xmath13 of genus @xmath11 . then : @xmath44    we can turn @xmath38 into a geometric surface by defining a metric on the underlying triangle . here , the metric we choose is the metric of the ideal hyperbolic triangle .",
    "this metric extends to all of @xmath45 so long as the gluing maps between the triangles are isometries .",
    "there are an uncountable number of such isometries , and in this article we choose the unique gluing such that the perpendiculars connecting the identified sides to the vertices opposite them meet , as in figure [ pic_gluing ] below :    pic_gluing.pdf ( 5,70 ) @xmath46    in a general gluing of ideal hyperbolic triangles , the signed distance between the two endpoints of the perpendiculars is called the _ shear _ of the gluing . in other words , we choose each of our gluings to have shear @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that @xmath38 is a punctured surface with a complete hyperbolic structure .",
    "the punctures of @xmath45 , called cusps , correspond one - to - one with cycles in @xmath36 that consist exclusively of lefthand turns .",
    "it is also possible to turn @xmath38 into a closed hyperbolic surface . to see this",
    ", we recognize the hyperbolic structure on @xmath38 as a conformal structure in which the cusps are conformally equivalent to punctured disks . by adding points to these punctured disks",
    ", we can extend this conformal structure to a conformal structure of a closed surface .",
    "the uniformization theorem gives the existence of a unique complete hyperbolic structure in the equivalence class of this conformal surface ( provided that the genus of @xmath13 is at least @xmath21 , which we assume ) .",
    "our surface , equipped with this specific hyperbolic structure , will be denoted @xmath48 .",
    "a particularly nice feature of the construction above is that the geometry of @xmath38 is entirely determined by the combinatorics of the underlying ribbon graph @xmath36 . in what follows",
    "we will explain how to understand the geometry of curves on @xmath38 in terms of @xmath36 .",
    "it is a classical fact from hyperbolic geometry ( see for example theorem 1.6.6 in @xcite ) that the homotopy class of a non - peripheral , non - trivial closed curve @xmath49 contains a unique geodesic @xmath50 .",
    "this geodesic minimizes the length among all curves in that homotopy class .",
    "furthermore , if the surface is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a torsion - free discrete subgroup , then we can find a hyperbolic element @xmath53 such that the axis of @xmath11 in @xmath46 projects to the @xmath50 in @xmath13 .",
    "the length of @xmath54 is equal to the translation length @xmath55 of @xmath11 .",
    "this translation length is in turn given by : @xmath56 in which @xmath57 denotes the trace of @xmath58 .",
    "the construction of @xmath38 allows us to recover the translation length for a given curve .",
    "namely , given a curve @xmath49 on @xmath38 , we can homotope it to a cycle at most once will be called a _ circuit_.",
    "] @xmath54 on the graph @xmath59 .",
    "because @xmath3 is oriented we can tell whether @xmath49 turns ` left ' or ` right ' at a given vertex .",
    "this means that traversing the curve @xmath49 once gives us a word @xmath60 in letters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we set @xmath63 which turns @xmath60 into a matrix .",
    "the length of the unique geodesic @xmath54 homotopic to @xmath49 is now given by @xmath64 note that the word @xmath60 is not well - defined : it depends on where we start to traverse @xmath49 and in which direction we do so .",
    "this has no effect on the trace , however , which means that @xmath65 _ is _ well - defined .",
    "when we consider @xmath48 instead , we seem to lose the combinatorial description of the length of curves : the uniformization theorem tells us that there is a natural hyperbolic structure on @xmath48 , but it does not tell us anything about the geometry of this structure",
    ". however , there is a way to solve this problem , using a result of brooks @xcite .",
    "we first need the following definition :    let @xmath13 be a hyperbolic surface with at least one cusp and fix @xmath66 . then @xmath13 is said to have _ cusp length _",
    "@xmath67 if for each cusp of @xmath13 there exists a non - self - intersecting horocycle of length @xmath68 about that cusp , such that no two horocycles intersect .",
    "we have the following lemma :    [ lem_brooks ] @xcite let @xmath36 be a cubic ribbon graph such that @xmath38 has cusp length @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is sufficiently large .",
    "then for every non - peripheral and homotopically essential geodesic @xmath69 on @xmath48 there exists a geodesic @xmath49 on @xmath38 such that the image of @xmath49 under the map @xmath70 is homotopic to @xmath69 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that in order to understand the lengths of curves on a surface @xmath38 we need to understand which words in @xmath61 and @xmath62 appear as cycles on @xmath36 . in this section we collect some basic properties of the set of words in @xmath61 and @xmath62 and use these properties to produce estimates for the number of words in @xmath61 and @xmath62 of bounded trace .",
    "we start with some notation .",
    "the semigroup of words in @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( as defined in line ) will be denoted @xmath74 elements of this set will sometimes be interpreted as matrices and sometimes as strings in two letters .",
    "it will be clear from the context which of the two we mean .",
    "we define an equivalence relation on @xmath75 as follows :    let @xmath76 .",
    "we write @xmath77 if either of the following is true :    * @xmath78 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath79 .",
    "* @xmath78 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath80 , where @xmath80 is the word obtained by reading @xmath79 backwards and interchanging @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in the previous section we noted that the map from cycles on @xmath36 to @xmath75 is not well - defined .",
    "the equivalence defined here solves this problem , since the compositions of maps into @xmath81 _ is _ well - defined .",
    "if @xmath49 is a cycle on @xmath3 and its image under the given map is @xmath82 $ ] we say that @xmath49 _ carries _ @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "the following lemma provides various estimates on the trace of words in @xmath75 :    [ lem_basic ] let @xmath83 . if @xmath84 can be obtained from inserting letters from @xmath85 into @xmath79 then",
    ": @xmath86 moreover , @xmath87 in general , and @xmath88 unless @xmath89 for some @xmath90 .    by the identity",
    "@xmath91 we see that @xmath92 with equality if and only if @xmath93 , ie . if and only if @xmath94 for some @xmath90 .",
    "since any letter insertion is equivalent ( modulo @xmath95 ) to left - multiplication by @xmath61 and trace is well - defined on @xmath81 , we see that trace is non - decreasing with letter insertion .    to prove the upper bound on @xmath96 we use the fact that among all words of @xmath1 letters , the trace is maximized by words of the form @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( depending on whether @xmath1 is even or odd ) .",
    "this in turn follows from an elementary but tedious case by case analysis .",
    "the fact that the traces of @xmath97 and @xmath98 satisfy the inequality follows by direct computation .    if @xmath99 , choose @xmath100 ending in @xmath101 . for each letter of @xmath102 prepended to @xmath101 , we augment our trace by at least @xmath103 .",
    "( in the case of multiplication by @xmath61 , this is line . )",
    "it follows that @xmath104 .",
    "in particular , the insertion of letters into a word can not decrease its trace . from this , we for instance conclude that the systole of @xmath48 is always homotopic to a circuit in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath105 denote the semigroup of integer matrices with determinant @xmath103 and non - negative coordinates .",
    "it s clear that @xmath105 contains @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath106 denote the number of elements in @xmath75 of trace @xmath90 .",
    "the infinite collections @xmath107 and @xmath108 demonstrate that @xmath109 is not finite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath106 is finite for @xmath110 , as the following proposition shows :    [ upper_bound_prop ] the following inequality holds for all @xmath110 : @xmath111 in which @xmath112 is the number of divisors of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath113 denote the number of elements of @xmath105 of trace @xmath90 .",
    "then @xmath114 , whenever both are finite . to enumerate the elements of @xmath105 of trace @xmath90 ,",
    "consider a general matrix @xmath115 of trace @xmath90 .",
    "free choice of @xmath116 in the interval @xmath117 $ ] determines @xmath118 by trace . as well , the determinant relation @xmath119 gives @xmath120 , hence @xmath121 divides @xmath122 ( whereafter choice of @xmath121 determines @xmath123 uniquely ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath124 as desired .",
    "as it happens , the upper bound in proposition [ upper_bound_prop ] is an equality .",
    "this follows from the non - obvious fact that the inclusion @xmath125 is an equality :    we have @xmath126 .",
    "fix @xmath127 , defined as in line . for @xmath49 of trace @xmath21 , we see that @xmath49 takes the form @xmath128 or @xmath129 for some integer @xmath130 , hence @xmath131 . now ,",
    "suppose by induction that @xmath131 for all matrices of trace less than @xmath132 and fix @xmath49 of trace @xmath90 .",
    "computation shows that @xmath133 provided @xmath134 and @xmath135 , while @xmath136 under the assumptions @xmath137 and @xmath138 . for the sake of contradiction , suppose that neither holds . if @xmath134 and @xmath138 , then @xmath139 so that @xmath140 and @xmath141 , which contradicts that @xmath142 . alternatively , suppose that @xmath137 and @xmath135 . then @xmath143 another contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath105 contains at least one of @xmath144 or @xmath145 , hence so does @xmath75 ( by induction ) . in either case",
    ", it follows that @xmath131 .    to estimate the growth of @xmath106 we need only estimate the growth of the divisor function .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath146 for all @xmath147 , from which we immediately obtain that @xmath148 .",
    "we denote by @xmath149 the partial sums of @xmath106 , ie .",
    "@xmath150 this function satisfies the trivial upper bound @xmath151 . with a bit more work , we obtain a more precise upper bound for this function :    the function @xmath149 is @xmath152 .",
    "[ prop_trace_growth ]    interchanging the order of summation , we write @xmath153 so that the inner sum adds the contribution of the divisor function over the arithmetic progression @xmath154 . to continue , we require a well - known result due",
    "independently to selberg and hooley ; that the weil bound for the kloosterman sum gives a uniform estimate @xmath155 as recounted by fouvry and iwaniec in @xcite , eg .",
    "opening up the second divisor sum in the line above yields @xmath156 in which we ve abandoned coprimality to simplify our bound .",
    "returning to line , we take @xmath157 , and end with the estimate @xmath158 as desired .    _ remark",
    " _ conversely , restricting the final @xmath159-sum in line to the primes less than @xmath160 gives a lower bound in line in of the form @xmath161 .",
    "this propagates to show that @xmath162 , ie .",
    "that @xmath149 grows super - quadratically .",
    "the results from the previous section allow us to construct hyperbolic surfaces with systole logarithmic in their genus .",
    "the construction we present is a riemann surface version of the construction for graphs of large girth by erds and sachs @xcite and sauer @xcite , while our presentation is inspired by a version of these proofs given by bollobs @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in our theorem below we will speak of oriented circuits without reference to the specific oriented trivalent graphs containing them .",
    "an oriented circuit in this sense will be a circuit in which it is known whether one turns right or left when traversing a vertex in a given direction .",
    "note that such a circuit naturally corresponds to a word in @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in this way we are able to define the trace of a cycle or an oriented path .",
    "the data of an oriented path in this context includes the data of the direction the path turns in at its initial and final vertices .",
    "this means that an oriented path naturally runs between two edges instead of two vertices",
    ".          then we can complete @xmath165 to a trivalent ribbon graph @xmath167 , respecting the orientation of the circuits , in such a way that @xmath167 contains no homotopically essential non - peripheral cycle carrying a word of trace less than @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the girth of @xmath167 satisfies @xmath168 and every cusp in @xmath167 has at least @xmath1 triangles around it .",
    "our proof is constructive .",
    "we will construct a set @xmath169 of edges on @xmath170 that contains @xmath171 such that the graph @xmath172 has the desired properties . note that this construction does not add vertices , hence the orientation at every vertex in @xmath167 is given by the initial data and does not change anywhere in the process that we will describe .",
    "as such , we will not mention it in the rest of the proof .              in order to prove the claim we need to define some specific subsets of @xmath170 , depending on @xmath169 . given @xmath176 ,",
    "forbidden @xmath1-path _ between a degree @xmath21 vertex @xmath177 and a vertex @xmath178 will be a path in @xmath167 of trace less than @xmath179 and with fewer than @xmath179 edges .",
    "we emphasize again that the trace of a path depends on the choice of the directions of the turns at @xmath177 and @xmath178 . at @xmath177",
    "we we will always choose the direction so that the path comes from the ` missing ' edge at @xmath177 .",

    "this last case uses lemma [ lem_basic ] , and gives our claim directly .",
    "if our cycle has length @xmath183 , then it carries a word @xmath79 such that either        * there exist two degree @xmath21 vertices @xmath177 and @xmath178 in @xmath167 for which there does not exist a forbidden @xmath1-path connecting @xmath177 to @xmath178 .",

    ", we have @xmath247 where @xmath123 is the number of connected components of @xmath241 , @xmath248 the genus of the @xmath249 connected component , @xmath39 the number of vertices in the triangulation , @xmath40 the number of edges , and @xmath250 the number of faces .",
    "we have @xmath251 and thus @xmath252 since @xmath253 , each connected component of @xmath239 consists of at least @xmath254 vertices , hence @xmath255 .",
    "it follows that @xmath256 and hence @xmath257 in which @xmath62 is a constant independent of @xmath1 and @xmath17 is the genus of any of the connected components of @xmath241 or the sum of all these genera , depending on the reader s preference .",
    "line proves the first inequality of line ; for the second inequality , we need only recall lemma [ lem_brooks ] .    to prove that the genera of these surfaces actually grow super - quadratically in @xmath1",
    ", we use that the fact that @xmath239 embeds into @xmath241 .",
    "this puts restrictions on the genus @xmath17 of @xmath241 . concretely ,",
    "proposition [ prp_graphgen ] tells us that @xmath258 since @xmath259 , the lefthand side above tends to @xmath260 as @xmath1 grows large , hence @xmath261 , which completes the proof .",
    "finally , we remark that theorem [ thm_construction ] gives us some control over the bottom part of the length spectrum .",
    "that is , given @xmath262 and @xmath263 such that there exist words @xmath264 satisfying @xmath265 for @xmath31 , we can construct our cusped surface in such a way that it has systole @xmath266 , genus @xmath267 , and contains at least @xmath29 curves of length @xmath268 for @xmath31",
    ". in the closed case we do not get such exact control , but we can choose to construct the surfaces such that they contain @xmath29 curves with lengths in a small interval around the values above .",
    "by lemma [ lem_brooks ] these intervals become arbitrarily small as @xmath269 becomes large .",
    "given words @xmath270 , the condition on the multiplicities @xmath29 is easy to verify .",
    "however , without explicit examples of words , it is not easy to see whether a set of traces @xmath271 and multiplicities @xmath28 is ` realizable ' .",
    "a sufficient ( but certainly not necessary ) condition on the traces and multiplicities is @xmath272 this follows from the fact that @xmath273 ."
