    "the cleo iii detector was designed to study decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , @xmath3 leptons and @xmath4 mesons produced in @xmath5 collisions near 10 gev center - of - mass energy .",
    "the new detector is an upgraded version of cleo ii @xcite .",
    "it contains a new four - layer silicon strip vertex detector , a new wire drift chamber and a particle identification system based on the detection of cherenkov ring images .",
    "information about cleo iii is available elsewhere @xcite .",
    "cleo ii produced many physics results , but was hampered by its limited charged - hadron identification capabilities .",
    "design choices for particle identification were limited by radial space and the necessity of minimizing the material in front of the csi crystal calorimeter .",
    "the csi imposed a hard outer radial limit and the desire for maintaining excellent charged particle tracking imposed a lower limit , since at high momentum the error in momentum is proportional to the square of the track length .",
    "the particle identification system was allocated only 20 cm of radial space , and this limited the technology choices .",
    "we were also allowed a total material thickness corresponding to only 12% of a radiation length .",
    "outline of cleo iii rich design.,height=230 ]    the severe radial spatial requirement forces a thin , few cm detector for cherenkov photons and a thin radiator .",
    "otherwise the photons have little distance to travel and it becomes very difficult to precisely measure the photon angles .",
    "in fact , the only thin photon - detectors possible in our situation were wire chamber based , either csi or a mixture of triethylamine ( tea ) and methane .",
    "use of csi would have allowed us to use a liquid freon radiator with quartz windows in the system using the optical wavelength region from about 160 - 200 nm . however , at the time of decision , the use of csi was far from proven and , in any case , would have imposed severe constraints on the construction process which would have been both difficult and expensive .",
    "thus we chose tea + ch@xmath6 and used cherenkov photons between 135 - 165 nm generated in a 1 cm thick lif crystal and used caf@xmath7 windows on our wire chambers ( lif windows were used on 10% of the chambers)@xcite .",
    "details of the design of the cleo iii rich have been discussed before @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the main elements .",
    "cherenkov photons are produced in a lif radiator .",
    "the photons then enter a free space , an  expansion volume , \" where the cone of cherenkov light expands . finally the photons enter a detector consisting of multi - wire proportional chambers filled with a mixture of tea and ch@xmath6 gases .",
    "no light focusing is used ; this is called `` proximity - focusing '' @xcite .",
    "the scheme is shown in the upper left of fig .",
    "[ rich_descrip ] .",
    "there are 30 photon detectors around the cylinder .",
    "they subtend the same azimuthal angle as the radiators , which are also segmented into 14 sections along their length of the cylinder .",
    "the gap between the radiators and detectors , called the  expansion gap \" , is filled with pure n@xmath7 gas .",
    "the wire chamber design is shown in fig .",
    "[ rich_descrip ] .",
    "lif was chosen over caf@xmath7 or mgf@xmath7 , both of which are transparent in the useful wavelength region , because of smaller chromatic error .",
    "originally all the radiators were planned to be 1 cm thick planar pieces . however , since the refractive index of lif at 150 nm is 1.5 , all the cherenkov light from tracks normal to the lif would be totally internally reflected as shown in fig .",
    "[ radiators ] ( top ) .",
    "we could have used these flat radiators , but we would have had to tilt them at about a 15@xmath8 angle .",
    "instead we developed radiators with striations in the top surface , called  sawtooth \" radiators @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ radiators ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the overall radiator shape approximates a cylinder of radius 82 cm .",
    "individual radiators are placed in 14 coaxial rings of 30 crystals each , centered around the beam line and symmetrically positioned about the interaction point .",
    "only the inner four radiators are sawtooths.(the 30 crystals segments are parallel to the wire chambers . )",
    "inter - crystal gaps are typically 50 @xmath9 m .",
    "the crystals are attached to the exterior surface of a 1.5 mm thick carbon fiber shell with a low outgassing epoxy .",
    "construction was carried out in a class 100 clean room that was dehumidified below 35% .",
    "granite tables were used that were flat over the entire surface of a photon detector module to better than 15 @xmath9 m .",
    "the photon detectors have segmented cathode pads 7.5 mm ( length ) x 8.0 mm ( width ) etched onto g10 boards .",
    "the pad array was formed from four individual boards , with 24 x 80 pads , with the latter separated into two 40 pad sections with a 6 mm gap .",
    "each board was individually flattened in an oven and then they were glued together longitudinally on a granite table where reinforcing g10 ribs were also glued on .",
    "there are 4 longitudinal ribs that have a box structure .",
    "smaller cross ribs are placed every 12 cm for extra stiffening .",
    "the total length was 2.4 m.    wire planes were separately strung with 20 @xmath9 m diameter gold plated tungsten with a 3% admixture of rhenium produced by luma ; the wire pitch was 2.66 mm , for a total of 72 wires per chamber .",
    "the wires were placed on and subsequently glued to precision ceramic spacers 1 mm above the cathodes and 3.5 mm to the caf@xmath7 windows , every 30 cm .",
    "we achieved a tolerance of 50 @xmath9 m on the wire to cathode distance .",
    "the spacers had slots in the center for the glue bead .",
    "eight 30 cm x 19 cm caf@xmath7 windows were glued together in precision jigs lengthwise to form a 2.4 m long window .",
    "positive high voltage is applied to the anode wires , while - high voltage is put on 100 @xmath9 m wide silver traces deposited on the caf@xmath7 .",
    "the spacing between the traces is 2.5 mm . to maintain the ability of disconnecting any faulty part of a chamber",
    ", the wire hv is distributed independently to 3 groups of 24 wires and the windows are each powered separately .",
    "the position of cherenkov photons is measured by sensing the induced charge on array of 7.5 mm x 8.0 mm cathode pads . since the pulse height distribution from single photons",
    "is expected to be exponential at low to moderate gas gains @xcite , this requires the use of low noise electronics .",
    "pad clusters in the detector can be formed from single cherenkov photons , overlaps of more than one cherenkov photon or charged tracks . in fig .",
    "[ charge_distribution ] we show the pulse height distribution for single photons , and charged tracks .",
    "we can distinguish somewhat between single photons hitting the pad array and two photons because of the pulse height shapes on adjacent pads .",
    "the charged tracks give very large pulse heights because they are traversing 4.5 mm of the ch@xmath6-tea mixture .",
    "[ htb ]    2.5 in    to have as low noise electronics as possible , a dedicated vlsi chip , called va_rich , based on a very successful chip developed for solid state applications , has been designed and produced for our application at ide as , norway .",
    "we have fully characterized 3,600 64 channel chips , mounted on hybrid circuits . for moderate values of the input capacitance @xmath10 , the equivalent noise charge measured @xmath11",
    "is found to be about : @xmath12 its dynamic range is between 450,000 and 900,000 electrons , depending upon whether we choose a bias point for the output buffer suitable for signals of positive or negative polarity or we shift this bias point to have the maximum dynamic range for signals of a single polarity .    in our readout scheme",
    "we group 10 chips in a single readout cell communicating with data boards located in vme crates just outside the detector cylinder .",
    "chips in the same readout cell share the same cable , which routes control signals and bias voltages from the data boards and output signals to the data boards .",
    "two va_rich chips are mounted using wire bonds on one hybrid circuit that is attached via two miniature connectors to the back of the cathode board of the photon detector .",
    "the analog output of the va_rich is transmitted to the data boards as a differential current , transformed into a voltage by transimpedance amplifiers and digitized by a 12 bit differential adc .",
    "these receivers are part of very complex data boards which perform several important analog and digital functions .",
    "each board contains 15 digitization circuits and three analog power supply sections providing the voltages and currents to bias the chips , and calibration circuitry .",
    "the digital component of these boards contains a sparsification circuit , an event buffer , memory to store the pedestal values , and the interface to the vme cpu .",
    "coherent noise is present .",
    "we eliminate this by measuring the pulse heights on all the channels and performing an average of the non - struck channels before the data sparsification step @xcite .",
    "the pedestal width ( rms ) changes from 3.6 to 2.5 channels with and without this coherent noise subtraction , respectively .",
    "the total noise of the system then is @xmath13500 electrons rms .",
    "the gas system supplies several distinct volumes .",
    "the systems must : supply ch@xmath6-tea to 30 separate chambers , supply super - clean n@xmath7 to the expansion gap , supply super - clean n@xmath7 to a sealed single volume surrounding all the chambers , called the electronics volume , since this is the region where the front - end hybrid boards are present .",
    "in addition we need to test ch@xmath6-tea for the ability to detect photons and test the output n@xmath7 for purity .",
    "it is of primary importance that the gas system must not destroy any of the thin caf@xmath7 windows .",
    "we use computerized pressure and flow sensors with plc controllers .",
    "the gas system works great .",
    "n@xmath7 transparency is @xmath1499% .",
    "nothing has been broken !",
    "the detector has been in operation since september of 1999 .",
    "all but @xmath132% of the detector is functioning .",
    "we lost 1% due to the breaking of one wire after about one year of operation .",
    "we have also lost 2% of the electronics chips .",
    "coherent noise suppression and data sparsification are performed on - line to eliminate the gaussian part of the electric noise .",
    "a small non - gaussian component of the coherent electric noise is eliminated off - line , by using an algorithm too complicated for use in the data board dsp .",
    "the incoherent part of non - gaussian noise was eliminated by off - line pulse height thresholds adjusted to keep occupancy of each channel below 1% .",
    "finally we eliminate clusters of cathode pad hits that are extended along the anode wires , but are only 1 - 2 pads wide in the other direction .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ images ] the hit pattern in the detector for a bhabha scattering event ( @xmath15 ) for track entering the plane ( left image ) and sawtooth ( right image ) radiators .",
    "the shapes of the cherenkov ",
    "rings \" are different in the two cases , resulting from refraction when leaving the lif radiators .",
    "the hits in the centers of the images are produced by the electron passing the rich mwpc .",
    "the entire detector contains 230,400 cathode pads , which are segmented into 240 modules of @xmath16 pads separated by the mounting rails and anode wire spacers .",
    "we cluster pad hits in each module separately .",
    "pad hits touching each other either by a side or a corner form a  connected region . \"",
    "each charged track reconstructed in the cleo - iii tracking system @xcite is projected onto the rich mwpc and matched to the closest connected region .",
    "if the matching distance between the track projection and the connected region center is reasonably small and the total pulse height of the connected region sufficiently high we associate this group of hits with the track .",
    "local pulse height maxima in the remaining connected regions , so called  bumps \" are taken as seeds for cherenkov photons .",
    "we allow the pulse height maxima to touch each other by corners if the pulse height in the two neighboring pads is small relative to both bump hits .",
    "hits adjacent to the bumps on the sides are assigned to them in order of decreasing bump pulse height .    to estimate the position of the photon conversion point we use the center - of - gravity method corrected for the bias towards the central pad .",
    "for many cherenkov photons we are able to detect induced charge in only one pad . since the pad dimensions are about @xmath17 mm@xmath18 , the position resolution in this case is @xmath19 mm . for charged track intersections , which induce significant charge in many pads ,",
    "the position resolution is @xmath20 mm .",
    "the position resolution for cherenkov photons which generate multiple pad hits is somewhere in between these two values . in any case , the photon position error is not a significant contribution to the cherenkov angle resolution ( see below ) .",
    "the resolution of the cleo - iii tracking system is very good in the bending view ( the magnetic field is solenoidal in cleo ) @xcite .",
    "the track position and inclination angle along the beam axis is measured less precisely , with the silicon vertex detector playing the dominant role .",
    "the rms of the observed rich hit residual is 1.7 mm . since the rich hit position resolution is 0.76 mm as measured by the residual in the perpendicular direction , the rich mwpc can clearly help in pinning down the track trajectory .",
    "this , in turn , improves cherenkov resolution , especially for the flat radiators for which we observe only half of the cherenkov image and thus are quite sensitive to the tracking error .",
    "the improvement is as much as 50%  is some parts of the detector .      given the measured position of the cherenkov photon conversion point in the rich mwpc , the charged track direction and its intersection point with the lif radiator , we calculate a cherenkov angle for each photon - track combination ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we use the formalism outlined by ypsilantis and sguinot @xcite , except that we adopt a numerical method to find the solution to the equation for the photon direction , instead of simplifying it to a @xmath22 order polynomial , which would allow an analytical solution , but at the expense of introducing an additional source of error . furthermore , using our numerical method , we calculate derivatives of the cherenkov angle with respect to the measured quantities which allows us to propagate the detector errors and the chromatic dispersion to obtain an expected cherenkov photon resolution for each photon independently ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is useful , since the cherenkov angle resolution varies significantly even within one cherenkov image .",
    "we use these estimated errors when calculating particle i d likelihoods and use them as to weight each photon when considering the average cherenkov angle for a track .",
    "we first view the physics performance on the simplest type of events , bhabha events and then subsequently in hadronic events . the cherenkov angle measured for each photon",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ single_photon ] .",
    "we note that bhabha events are very low multiplicity compared with our normal hadronic events .",
    "they have two charged tracks present while the hadronic events have an average charged multiplicity of approximately 10 . in addition",
    ", the hadronic events have on the average 10 photons , mainly from @xmath24 decays .",
    "all of these particles can interact in the calorimeter and the splash - back can hit the rich photon detector .",
    "this cherenkov angle spectrum for single photons has an asymmetric tail and modest background .",
    "it is fit with a line - shape similar to that used by for extracting photon signals from electromagnetic calorimeters @xcite .",

    "the single photon resolution averaged over the detector solid angles are 14.7 mr for the flat radiator and 12.2 mr for the sawtooth .          the number of photons per track within a @xmath31 of the expected cherenkov angle for each photon is shown in fig .",
    "[ ngamma ] and shown as a function of radiator ring in fig .  [ bha_photon ] . averaged over the detector , and subtracting the background we have a mean number of 10.6 photons with the flat radiators and 11.9 using the sawtooth radiators .",

    "these track angles are shown in fig .  [ trk_res ] .",

    "the resolutions as a function of radiator ring are shown in fig .",
    "[ bha_track ] .",
    "the cherenkov angular resolution is comprised of several different components .",
    "this include error on the location of the photon emission point , the chromatic dispersion , the position error in the reconstruction of the detected photons and finally the error on determining the charged track s direction and position .",

    "we find the most likely mass hypotheses .",
    "photons that match the most hypothesis within @xmath33 are then removed from consideration for the other tracks . to study the rich performance in hadronic events we use @xmath34 , @xmath35 events .",
    "the charge of the slow pion in the @xmath36 decay is opposite to the kaon charge in subsequent @xmath37 decay .",
    "therefore , the kaon and pion in the @xmath37 decay can be identified without use of the rich detector .",
    "the effect of the small combinatorial background is eliminated by fitting the @xmath37 mass peak in the @xmath38 mass distribution to obtain the number of signal events for each momentum bin .",
    "single - photon cherenkov angle distributions obtained on such identified kaons with the momentum above 0.7 gev / c are plotted in fig .",
    "[ single_photon_hadrons ] .",
    "averaged over all radiators , the single - photon resolution is 13.2 mr and 15.1 mr for sawtooth and flat radiators respectively .",
    "the background fraction within @xmath33 of the expected value is 12.8% and 8.4% .",
    "the background - subtracted mean photon yield is 11.8 and 9.6 .",
    "finally the per - track cherenkov angle resolution is 3.7 mr and 4.9 mr .            for parts of the cherenkov image for the sawtooth radiator , and for tracks intersecting more than one radiator",
    "there are some optical path ambiguities that impact the cherenkov angle calculations . in the previous section we bypassed this problem by selecting the optical path that produces the closest cherenkov angle to the expected one ( @xmath39 ) for the given particle hypothesis ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "there is some loss of information in this procedure , therefore , we use the likelihood method to perform particle identification instead of the per - track average angle .",
    "the likelihood method weights each possible optical path by the optical probability ( @xmath41 ) , which includes length of the radiation path and the refraction probabilities obtained by the inverse ray tracing method : @xmath42 where , @xmath43 is the likelihood for the particle hypothesis @xmath40 ( @xmath44 , @xmath9 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 is the background probability approximated by a constant and @xmath49 is the signal probability given by the line - shape defined previously . in principle , the likelihood could include all hits in the detector . in practice , there is no point in inspecting hits which are far away from the regions where photons are expected for at least one of the considered hypotheses ( we use @xmath50 cut - off ) .",
    "an arbitrary scale factor in the likelihood definition cancels when we consider likelihood ratios for two different hypotheses .",
    "the likelihood conveniently folds in information about values of the cherenkov angles and the photon yield for each hypothesis . for well separated hypotheses",
    "( typically at lower momenta ) it is the photon yield that provides the discrimination . for hypotheses that produce cherenkov images in the same area of the detector ,",
    "the values of the cherenkov angles do the job . since our likelihood definition does not know about the radiation momentum threshold , the likelihood ratio method can be only used when both hypotheses are sufficiently above the thresholds .",
    "when one hypothesis is below the radiation threshold we use a value of the likelihood for the hypothesis above the threshold to perform the discrimination .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath51 , is expected to behave as the difference @xmath52 .",
    "this @xmath53 difference obtained for 1.0 - 1.5 gev / c kaons and pions identified with the @xmath54 method is plotted in fig .",

    "about 98% of the detector is operational ( 1% loss due to one broken wire and 1% due to electronic failures ) .",
    "the particle momenta for @xmath55 meson decay products seen by cleo are less than @xmath56 gev / c .",
    "the detector provides excellent separation between pions and kaons at and below this cutoff .",
    "separation between kaons and protons extends to even higher momentum , where it is used in charm baryon studies .",
