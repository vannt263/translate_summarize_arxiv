    "recent deep x - ray surveys with the chandra and xmm - newton observatories indicate that the bulk of the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) in the range 0.1 - 10 kev is the result of the integrated emission of discrete unresolved sources and accretion onto supermassive black holes over cosmic time .",
    "such deep surveys allowed to reach extremely low flux levels and to resolve 80 - 90% of the xrb below 10 kev . from optical indentifications we know that the dominant population in these surveys is a mixture of obscured and unobscured agn with an increasing fraction of obscuration at lower flux level ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . now , after resolving the majority of the xrb ,",
    "the most interesting problem is to understand the physical nature of these sources , their x - ray and optical properties , relation , influence and cosmological evolution of their different parameters .    to this aim",
    "we have performed an x - ray spectral analysis of the cdfs faint sources with the purpose to characterize and classify the x - ray properties of different agn populations .",
    "we search for relations between different x - ray physical parameters using the full x - ray sample , with additional analysis for the known @xmath3 subset .",
    "the chandra deep field - south ( cdfs ) is a 0.1 deg@xmath6 area of the sky in the southern hemisphere has been studied intensively by means of a megasecond dataset from the chandra observatory ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently the same field has been observed with the xmm - newton observatory .",
    "the xmm - newton dataset has some specific advantages .",
    "in particular , the epic cameras have a larger field - of - view than acis allowing for the detection of a number of new diffuse sources just outside the chandra field - of - view .",
    "the epic instruments have unprecedent high sensitivity in the hard x - ray band , and in the [ 5 - 10 ] kev band our dataset is comparable to the 1ms chandra image .",
    "analysis of the lockman hole ( lh ; @xcite ) has also confirmed the idea that x - ray spectroscopy of a large number of sources is very powerful with xmm - newton .",
    "the observed field was centered on the sky position ra 3:32:28 and dec -27:48:30 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the cdfs was selected for its low galactic neutral hydrogen column density @xmath7 @xmath1 ( @xcite ) , and a lack of bright foreground stars .",
    "the field has been observed with xmm - newton for a total of @xmath8 500 ksec in july 2001 and january 2002 in guaranteed observation time ( pi : j.bergeron ) , but due to high background conditions and flares , some data were lost and the exposure time for good quality observation added up to @xmath8 370 ksec .",
    "the used dataset of the cdfs is the result of the coaddition of 8 individual exposures with aimpoints only a few arcsec from each other .",
    "a large optical spectroscopic identification program has been carried out with the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) and the complete results of this campaign will be presented in @xcite .",
    "we selected from our data a sample of 70 x - ray sources with more than 100 counts in the 0.2 - 10 kev energy band , of which 44 have been spectroscopicaly identified .",
    "our full sample includes 29 type-1 agn ( including 12 type-1 qsos ) , 10 type-2 agn ( including 3 type-2 qsos ) , 28 unidentified sources , one normal galaxy and one star .",
    "the used classification scheme is the same as described in @xcite .",
    "this work includes analysis of epic - pn data only .    the @xmath3 distribution of the cdfs sources peak at redshift below 1 .",
    "this distribution confirm the already remarked disagreement between the prediction from x - ray background population synthesis models ( @xcite ) , with a maximum around @xmath9 , and the recent observations .",
    "such a discrepancy was already noted for the 100 ksec observation of the lockman hole with xmm - newton @xcite and for the 1 msec chandra survey of the cdfs @xcite .",
    "we use an automated procedure to extract individual x - ray spectra and used xspec ( v11.2 ) for the spectral fitting analysis .",
    "initially , we fit the data with a model consisting of a power law with an intrinsic absorption ( wabs or zwabs , if the redshift was known ) component , with an additional photoelectric absorption component ( wabs ) that was fixed at the galactic column density of @xmath10 @xmath1 .",
    "we used a scattering model when there was an unambiguous soft x - ray excess , which was present in several of the type-2 agn",
    ".      from our model fits , we computed the slope of a power law spectrum ( photon index @xmath11 ) , an intrinsic column density @xmath12 , and the x - ray luminosity in the [ 0.5 - 2 ] and [ 2 - 10 ] kev rest - frame bands .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed for the both subsample with known redshifts and the remainder of the data set .",
    "results are given in figures  [ jb - e1_fig : fig1 ] and figures  [ jb - e1_fig : fig2 ] .",
    "versus @xmath12 for subsample without known @xmath3 . for both parameters , error bars correspond to 90% confidence level .",
    ", width=264 ]     versus @xmath12 for the known @xmath3 subsample . for both parameters ,",
    "error bars correspond to 90% confidence level .",
    ", width=283 ]    these plots show the differences between the observed values ( when we assume that @xmath13 if we do not know redshift , and that the @xmath12 obtained is only a lower limit ) and the proper values of @xmath12 in the source rest - frame ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the classical and obscured agn populations show clearly different mean values of @xmath12 .",
    "we find no correlation between @xmath11 and the intrinsic absorption column @xmath14 density .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 for the type-1 agn range from 1.73 to 2.92 , with the majority of the sources clustering around 2.07 , i.e. close to the canonical value for broad line unabsorbed agns . for type-2 agn",
    "we obtained a lower value , with average @xmath11 = 1.87 .",
    "these results confirming the idea that the clear separation between the two agn populations is due mostly to differences in the absorption column density , not in @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the mean values of @xmath11 derived for both the known @xmath3 and unknown @xmath3 subsamples are approximately similar : we obtained @xmath15 with a large spread of @xmath16 .",
    "the average value of @xmath11 obtained from stacked technique is lower @xcite because the signature of absorption is washed out ( mainly a redshift effect ) .",
    "all these results is consistent with similar analysis of the lockman hole @xcite .",
    "as previously noted for the chandra megasecond dataset ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , in both the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) and the soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) bands the number of hard sources increases at lower fluxes .",
    "to better understand exactly how the spectrum of xrb is built up at different fluxes , @xcite divided the hard - band sample into four subsamplesin in terms of the hard fluxes : bright ( s@xmath17 2 @xmath18 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , medium ( 2 @xmath19 s @xmath17 6 @xmath20 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , faint ( s @xmath21 6 @xmath20 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , and very faint ( s @xmath21 2 @xmath20 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) .",
    "each of these samples was fit with an absorbed power law in the 1 to 10 kev energy range with the local absorption fixed to the galactic value .",
    "@xcite found a trends of hardening of the stacked spectra ( decrease in @xmath5 ) with decreasing x - ray flux in the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) band . in order to investigate the behaviour of the spectral shape as a function of the hard flux",
    ", we repeated the same procedure that was used for the chandra data set for the corresponding sources in our data set ( assume that fluxes from xmm - newton and chandra datasets are equal ) .",
    "we use the catalog from @xcite and fitted our data in the two energy bands : 1 - 8 kev ( for comparison with results from the chandra dataset ) and 0.4 - 8 kev ( include soft band ) . for a detailed description of the data reduction and analysis see @xcite .",
    "the trend is apparent in figure  [ jb - e1_fig : fig3 ] where our results are compared to the corresponding results from the chandra dataset .",
    "the filled hexagons refer to the 1 ms chandra exposure of the cdfs @xcite .",
    "xmm - newton data were fitted in the two energy bands : 1 - 8 kev ( open squares ) for comaprison with results from the chandra data set and 0.4 - 8 kev to include soft band ( filled square ) .",
    "errors on @xmath11 refer to the 90% confidence level .",
    "the local absorption has been fixed to the galactic value of @xmath10 @xmath1 .",
    "the line corresponds to the average @xmath11 for the background.,width=264 ]    the best - fit slope of the stacked spectra for [ 1 - 8 ] kev is 1.773 @xmath22 0.031 , 1.568 @xmath22 0.024 , 1.333 @xmath22 0.041 , and 1.178 @xmath22 0.031 , respectively .",
    "the average slope of the stacked spectra for [ 0.4 - 8 ] kev is 1.819 @xmath22 0.012 , 1.699 @xmath22 0.014 , 1.457 @xmath22 0.027 , and 1.296 @xmath22 0.058 , respectively .",
    "we detect a significant hardening of the average spectral slope going to lower fluxes .",
    "however , we also detect not only a regular increase in @xmath5 with decreasing flux for different subsamples of fluxes in comparison with chandra results , but we also see a discrepancy of the values within our own data set , if we fitted in the different energy bands .",
    "the first examples of the long - sought class of type-2 qso have been detected in two deep chandra fields @xcite , @xcite and in the xmm - newton deep survey in the lockman hole field @xcite . in our field , at @xmath232 , there are six type-2 qsos ( xid 27 , 54 , 57 , 202 , 263 , 112 ) , the most famous of which is # 202 , founded and described in detail by @xcite .",
    "all these objects have narrow l@xmath24 and civ emission , @xmath25 -0.2 , and faint optical magnitudes @xmath26 24.0 @xcite .             for soft and hard components).,width=264 ]",
    "the next step after investigating the individual spectra was to group the faint objects by source classification and combine their spectra in order to determine general spectral properties for each type of object . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we present here only the results for the type-@xmath27 qsos .",
    "the integrated spectra for the other object classes will be presented in a future paper .",
    "all of the type-@xmath27 qso spectra were extracted simultaneously , and we assumed an average redshift for these objects of @xmath28 ( figures  [ jb - e1_fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "our integrated absorbed spectrum shows a clear soft excess , which we fit by scattering model consisting of the sum of two power law components having the same spectral index but different normalizations and absorptions .",
    "one power law is absorbed by the galactic column density only and the other is absorbed by a high intrinsic column density ( a free parameter during the fit procedure ) .",
    "our model yelds a good description of the data .",
    "result is shown in figures  [ jb - e1_fig : fig6 ] . our spectrum",
    "( 1175 epic - pn counts in the [ 0.3 - 8 ] kev band ) is well fitted ( @xmath29 ) by a scattering model with n@xmath30 @xmath1 , @xmath31 for the both component .",
    "it has l@xmath32 erg s@xmath2 in the [ 2 - 10 ] kev rest - frame band .",
    "we can test for self - consistency by fitting the spectra to more complicated spectral models .",
    "we chose to fit the spectrum to models consisting of two independent power - law components ( @xmath33 ) , allowing their spectral parameters to vary independently , as the simplest way to test whether two components are required . if models in which the spectral ` shapes ' differ significantly are preferred , then the observed excess low - energy fluxes are more probably due to separate components of emission than to scattering .",
    "results are shown in figures  [ jb - e1_fig : fig7 ] .    by fitting a double power law model",
    "we obtain : n@xmath34 @xmath1 , and @xmath35 for the hard component and @xmath36 for the soft component ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it has l@xmath38 erg s@xmath2 in the [ 2 - 10 ] kev rest - frame band .",
    "we can see that our more complicated spectral models not provide significantly better fits than the scattering model , which yelds a good description of the data .",
    "thus , there is no reason to prefer a model with two components for this spectrum . in general , then , it seems that the single - component and scattering models are the simplest models which adequate describe the spectra , and assumption of more complicated models is not justified by these data .",
    "in these proceedings , we present some of our results from an analysis of a @xmath39 ks xmm - newton observation of the chandra deep field - south . we have derived the x - ray spectral properties of a subsample of 70 sources , of which 44 have been spectroscopicaly identified .",
    "we exploited the known @xmath3 subsample using several x - ray diagnostics to characterise the different agn populations .",
