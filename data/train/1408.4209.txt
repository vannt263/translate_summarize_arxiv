    "the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions are expected to produce a hot and dense form of matter called quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "the fireball produced in these collisions thermalizes rapidly leading to expansion and cooling of the system .",
    "subsequently , the hadronization takes place and the particles get detected in the detectors . during this process , two important stages occur as described below . the point in time after the collisions when the inelastic interactions among the particles stop is referred to as chemical freeze - out .",
    "the yields of most of the produced particles get fixed at chemical freeze - out .",
    "the statistical thermal models have successfully described the chemical freeze - out stage with unique system parameters such as chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath4 and baryon chemical potential @xmath5  @xcite . even after the chemical freeze - out",
    ", the elastic interactions among the particles are still ongoing which could lead to change in the momentum of the particles . after some time , when the inter - particle distance becomes so large that the elastic interactions stop , the system is said to have undergone kinetic freeze - out . at this stage ,",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath6 spectra of the produced particles get fixed .",
    "the hydrodynamics inspired models such as the blast wave model  @xcite have described the kinetic freeze - out scenario with a common temperature @xmath2 and average transverse radial flow velocity @xmath7 which reflects the expansion in transverse direction .",
    "quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , a theory of strong interactions , suggests that the phase diagram has two main phases : qgp and hadron gas .",
    "lattice qcd predicts that the transition between hadron gas and qgp is a crossover  @xcite at @xmath8 0 . at high @xmath5 ,",
    "the transition is expected to be a first order  @xcite . in between",
    ", one expects the position of the critical point , where the first order phase transition line ends  @xcite .",
    "the experiments at rhic focus on exploring the qcd phase diagram , locating a critical point and determining the phase boundary between hadron and qgp phase . in view of these , a beam energy scan ( bes ) program was started at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the first phase of the bes program yielded many interesting results as a function of energy or @xmath5 related to the search for critical point and phase boundary  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic freeze - out parameters provide important information about the collision dynamics .",
    "the vast range of data collected in the bes program allows for the systematic study of kinetic freeze - out parameters and to see their energy dependence trends .",
    "the bes results presented here are obtained for au+au collisions at @xmath9  7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , and 39 gev at mid - rapidity ( @xmath100.1 ) using both star time projection chamber ( tpc ) and time of flight ( tof ) detectors  @xcite .",
    "the error bars shown in figures represent the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "the pion spectra presented here are corrected for the weak decay feed - down and muon contamination while proton and anti - proton spectra are not corrected for feed - down effects .",
    "as mentioned earlier the kinetic freeze - out parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the system can be obtained using the hydrodynamics - motivated blast wave model .",
    "the model assumes that the particles are locally thermalized at kinetic freeze - out temperature and are moving with a common transverse collective flow velocity  @xcite . assuming a radially boosted thermal source , with a kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath2 and a transverse radial flow velocity @xmath11 , the transverse momentum @xmath6 distribution of the particles can be given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 being mass of a hadron , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "we use the flow velocity profile of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the surface velocity , @xmath20 is the relative radial position in the thermal source , and @xmath21 is the exponent of flow velocity profile .",
    "average transverse radial flow velocity @xmath22 can then be obtained as : @xmath23 .",

    "these distributions are fitted with the blast wave model which can be seen to reasonably describe the @xmath6 spectra of @xmath27 at all energies studied .",
    "the low @xmath6 part of pion spectra is affected by resonance decays due to which the pion spectra is fitted above @xmath28  0.5  gev/@xmath29 .",

    "the star symbols show results from the bes while the data points for ags , sps , top rhic , and lhc energies ( represented by open circles and squares ) , are taken from the references  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath35 increases with energy at lower energies , remains almost constant at the bes energies and then increases again towards higher energies up to the lhc .",
    "if the system is assumed to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath35 can be related to temperature and @xmath36 can be related to entropy of the system ( @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 ) . in view of this , the constant value of @xmath35 can be interpreted as a signature of first order phase transition  @xcite .",

    "if the collision energy is increased , the chemical freeze - out temperature increases and becomes constant after the @xmath911.5 gev .",
    "however , the @xmath2 is almost constant around the 7.739 gev and then decreases up to the lhc energies .",

    "the @xmath3 increases very rapidly at lower energies , remains almost constant for @xmath36=7.719.6 gev , and then increases again up to the lhc energies . since @xmath3 reflects the expansion in the transverse direction , it is observed that this expansion velocity is constant around @xmath36=7.719.6  gev .",
    "we have presented a systematic study of kinetic freeze - out parameters in heavy - ion collisions with results from the rhic bes program .",
    "the @xmath2 increases from central to peripheral collisions suggesting a longer lived fireball in central collisions , while @xmath30 decreases from central to peripheral collisions suggesting more rapid expansion in central collisions .",
    "the kinetic freeze - out temperature suggests a decrease from lower ( @xmath40 45 gev ) to higher ( @xmath40 2.76 tev ) energies . the separation between chemical and kinetic freeze - out temperatures increases while going towards higher energies , suggesting that hadronic interactions increase between chemical and kinetic freeze - out at higher energies .",
    "the average transverse radial flow velocity increases rapidly at lower energies ( @xmath40 23 gev ) .",
    "the expansion in the radial direction remains similar around @xmath97.719.6 gev and then increases towards higher energies where the initial energy density produced is higher .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath34 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 also shows similar constant behavior around lower bes energies which could be related to first - order phase transition signature .",
