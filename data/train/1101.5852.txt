    "landau - zener ( lz ) transitions@xcite at the anticrossings play a fundamental role in coherent quantum control which is key to the realization of quantum computation@xcite . to date , great efforts have been devoted to investigate the coherent quantum dynamics of the states at energy - level crossings . in a strongly harmonic - driven two - level system ( tls ) , repeated lz transitions give rise to stckelberg or ramsey - type oscillations , in analogy to mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer .",
    "the mz - type interferometry has been observed in a driven superconducting flux qubit@xcite , a cooper - pair box@xcite , and a quantum dot system@xcite .",
    "these patterns have been theoretically reconstructed from different perspectives@xcite .",
    "in addition to landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) interference of one - anticrossing type , several experiments have also reported lzs interference in the multi - anticrossing level structure . in the presence of much stronger harmonic excitation",
    ", the qubit state can be driven through more of the constituent energy - level anticrossings , and the resulting lzs interference reveals complex checkerboardlike patterns@xcite .",
    "this has been explained well in theory@xcite .",
    "most recently , a new method of coherent manipulation of quantum states in a tripartite quantum system formed by a superconducting qubit coupled to two tlss is reported@xcite .",
    "the manipulation relies on the lzs interference produced by transitions at the two anticrossings , and has potential application in precise control of quantum states in the tripartite system . nevertheless , a universal model to explain the observation has not been proposed .",
    "we shall show below that it can be understood rather easily using our approach .    in this work ,",
    "we start with a strongly driven one - anticrossing system where we consider lz transition as a gate operation .",
    "we then analyze the dynamics of multi - anticrossing system . under the strong triangle pulse",
    "driving , occupation probability of the system at the initial state exhibits , as a function of the driving amplitude and the pulse width , diverse lzs interference patterns .",
    "our approach presents a unified analytical treatment of these diverse patterns . in a specific case of two - anticrossing system ,",
    "we focus on how the interference patterns are influenced by the sweep rate and the coupling strength , and thereby elucidate the underlying physics of the various patterns . converting the patterns to the phase domain , fourier transform of the resulting population oscillation reveals fourier components of the compound pattern , which is in agreement with our analysis . in all the systems under study , the influence of relaxation and dephasing is neglected to obtain a clear physics picture of the underlying quantum physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the analytical expression to describe the dynamics for the multi - anticrossing system . in sec.iii",
    "we apply the general result to the @xmath0 case , and focus on the effect of the size of anticrossings on the interference patterns .",
    "the calculated patterns of four representative combinations of two anticrossings are in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "a discussion of the formation of the interesting dark state ",
    "one special case in the two - anticrossing system , is also included . in sec.iv ,",
    "fourier transform of these patterns are presented , exhibiting an explicitly ordered structure of one dimensional arcs that offers energy spectrum information . finally , sec.v contains a summary of this work .",
    "first , we consider one - anticrossing system in which two energy levels of a quantum tls `` cross '' each other as some external parameter is varied . at the energy - level crossing , hybridization of the two states results in an anticrossing due to coupling of the states , as shown in fig.[anticrossing](a ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of tls is ,    @xmath1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the energy levels of two diabatic states , and @xmath4 is their coupling strength .",
    "the transition between energy levels at the anticrossing is what we call lz transition .",
    "following damski and zurek s adiabatic - impulse approximation model@xcite , we can obtain a convenient description of the system s dynamics .",
    "it is provided that the system evolves adiabatically everywhere except at the points of minimum energy splitting where a sudden mixing in the population of the two energy levels occurs .",
    "this non - adiabatic transition at the anticrossing can be described by a unitary transformation@xcite .",
    "@xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the landau - zener transition probability at the anticrossing .",
    "if the anticrossing is swept from the infinity on one side to the infinity on the other , @xmath7 has the asymptotic form : @xmath8 in which @xmath9 is the variation rate of the energy separation between the two diabatic levels , and @xmath10 is the size of the anticrossing . in addition , phase jump @xmath11 , related to the general stokes phenomenon@xcite.@xmath12 is the so - called stokes phase that takes the form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is called adiabatic parameter and @xmath15 is the gamma function . in the adiabatic limit @xmath16 , and in the sudden limit @xmath17 .    from the perspective of optics , the avoided level crossing , when driven through ,",
    "can be viewed as a beam splitter , because lz transition taking place at the anticrossing splits an input state in a superposition of two states , just analogous to an optical beam splitter which splits the incident light in two . in this sense",
    ", we define reflection coefficient @xmath18 and transmission coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "then , we take into account the multi - anticrossing system which can be realized in a superconducting phase qubit with many tlss inside its josephson junction .",
    "a phase qubit@xcite consists of a single current - biased josephson junction . when biased close to the critical current @xmath20 , the qubit can be treated as a tunable artificial atom with discrete energy levels that exist in a potential energy landscape determined by the circuit design parameters and bias . in the qubit - tls coupled system",
    ", tls@xcite is formed in the disordered barrier material , where some atoms can occupy two positions , corresponding to two quantum states@xcite .",
    "when the energy separation of qubit states equals that of tls , resonant tunneling between the states opens an avoided level crossing in the energy spectrum of qubit , and forms a multi - anticrossing chain ( see fig.[anticrossing](b ) ) .",
    "its hamiltonian takes the form , @xmath21.\\ ] ] the time dependent @xmath22 is energy spacing between the ground state and the excited state of qubit and @xmath23 is energy spacing of the @xmath24 tls .",
    "it is assumed that qubit is initially prepared in its excited state , and quantum state transitions are then driven using a triangle pulse with amplitude v and period t. this is a double - passage process during which anticrossing regions are passed twice .",
    "the first excursion through the anticrossings coherently divides the signal into n output paths , where the dynamical phase is accumulated during the adiabatic parts of the evolution .",
    "then the second excursion recombines the separated signals via lz transition , and results in the lzs interference patterns .",
    "the algebra describing this one full driving cycle of triangle pulse is as follows . as the anticrossings are traversed from left to right in turn , according to eq.([lzgate ] ) the transition amplitude to each output path is : @xmath25 the adiabatic evolution is in the form of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the phase accumulated on path @xmath28 relative to the ground state @xmath29 between the two successive crossings .",
    "when the anticrossings are traversed from right to left , the transition amplitude back to the initial state from each path @xmath30 equals @xmath31 .",
    "then after one round of lzs interference , the amplitude for the coupling system remaining in the initial state is : @xmath32 therefore , the probability for the upper level after one period of triangle pulse is given by : @xmath33 it can be further simplified to the form , @xmath34 where @xmath35 here @xmath36dt$ ] ( at @xmath37 , the @xmath38th anticrossing is traversed from left ( right ) to right ( left ) ) is the interference phase accumulated in the area of region @xmath38 as shown in fig.[anticrossing](b ) .",
    "eq.([probability ] ) indicates that the resultant interference pattern is subject to the lz transition amplitude and the interference phase .",
    "every two paths in the energy diagram accumulate one interference phase and give rise to one type of interference fringes ( see fig.[anticrossing](b ) ) .",
    "the weightings of the @xmath39 interference patterns governed by a single phase difference on the resultant interference depend on lz transition amplitude .",
    "the two factors to determine the lz transition probability are the size of the anticrossing and the velocity with which it is traversed .",
    "therefore by varying sweep rate and coupling strength between qubit and tlss , we can generate a variety of interference patterns with promising use in quantum control .",
    "for example , ( 1 ) @xmath40 , which means the size of the @xmath41 anticrossing is so large that no ingredient of the wavefunction can transmit through it .",
    "therefore , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and the number of interferences reduces from @xmath39 to @xmath44 .",
    "especially , if @xmath45 , there is totally @xmath46 interference , i.e. , the interference between path 1 and path 2 .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath47 , which means the size of the @xmath41 anticrossing is so small that the wavefunction can not feel its existence . in this case , @xmath48 , and the @xmath41 path will not participate in the interference . for more interesting concrete examples ,",
    "let s turn to sec.iii .",
    "lzs interference in a phase qubit coupled to two tlss has recently been observed@xcite .",
    "3d view of the probability for the initial state of qubit under one round of strong triangle pulse drive explicitly characterizes the sweep - rate - dependency of lzs interference .",
    "this feature can be explained using the above result applied to n=2 case . in this case , the coupled hamiltonian is , @xmath49.\\ ] ] according to the general formula in eq.([probability ] ) , the occupation probability at the initial state @xmath50 after one pulse driving takes the form : @xmath51 where @xmath52(i = i ,",
    "ii ) is the total phase accumulated in region @xmath28 as shown in fig.2 .",
    "it clearly exhibits that the interference fringes comprise of 3 ( @xmath53 ) patterns , governed by phase accumulation in area i , ii , and i+ii , respectively . with",
    "the size of the two anticrossings fixed , as the sweep rate is varied , the interference pattern can be divided into three regions displaying the features of the three phase patterns respectively . in the slow limit , tls@xmath54 acts as a beam splitter and tls@xmath55 acts as a total reflection mirror ;",
    "@xmath56 pattern dominates . in the fast limit , tls@xmath54 acts as a total transmission mirror and tls@xmath55 acts as a beam splitter ;",
    "@xmath57 pattern makes the main contribution . in the intermediate region , both tls@xmath54 and tls@xmath55 act as beam splitters ; @xmath58 pattern is the principal feature .    on the other hand",
    ", the size of anticrossing also manipulates weights of the three patterns in the resulting compound interference fringes .",
    "though experimental realization of coupling strength control has not been achieved , investigation on the effect of the size of anticrossings on the interference patterns could make predictions of various interference fringes with potential use in future coherent control of hybrid qubit system .",
    "here we choose four representative combinations of two tlss , and the parameters used are extracted from g.z.suns experiment@xcite . based on this",
    "we discuss the effect of @xmath4 :    \\(i ) @xmath59 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the occupation probability approximately equals to : @xmath63 this combination reveals the main feature of @xmath56 pattern .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath64 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the occupation probability approximately equals to : @xmath68 this combination reveals the main feature of @xmath57 pattern .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath69 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the occupation probability approximately equals to : @xmath73 this combination reveals the main feature of @xmath58 pattern .",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath74 .",
    "the occupation probability is in the form of eq.([twotlss ] ) .",
    "provided that lz transition probability takes the asymptotic form in eq.([plz ] ) , interference patterns in the 4 cases above calculated based on eq.([twotlss ] ) ( see fig.[diffcombination](a)-(d ) ) , agree well with the numerical simulations ( see fig.[diffcombination](e)-(h ) ) , except the slight modulation in one interference fringe involved in the numerical results .",
    "the modulation is caused by the fluctuation of actual lz transition probabilities around its asymptotic form@xcite .",
    "in addition , it is noteworthy that in a qubit - two - tlss hybrid system , it is completely possible there exists a smaller anticrossing screened by a larger one .",
    "although the lzs interference is just the same as that of a single anticrossing , one branch in the spectrum is always at the excited state of tls , @xmath75 ( see red line in fig.[darkstate](b ) ) .",
    "the system s simplified hamiltonian in a basis formed by @xmath76 reads , @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the detuning between qubit and tls .",
    "the eigenstate corresponding to the particular branch is : @xmath79 with no ingredient of @xmath50 in it , the state @xmath80 is analogous to the dark state in quantum optics , which has no ingredient of excited state . in this sense",
    ", we can call this `` dark state of a hybrid qubit '' .",
    "vacancy of @xmath50 state could largely reduce the influence of environment on the dark state , and thereby has potential use in information storage . the specific method to realize",
    "this is in need of further investigation .    )",
    ".the red branch keeps staying at the state @xmath75.,width=264 ]",
    "furthermore , fourier transform is a helpful tool in identifying the individual phase components of the compound lzs interference .",
    "supposing the two - anticrossing system follows a linear ramp traversing the anticrossing regions , ft of the occupation probability in eq.([twotlss ] ) is found to be , @xmath81 where @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the diabatic energy - level slope , and @xmath84 is the detuning between the location of anticrossing i and ii .    therefore , it is expected that ft reveals a highly ordered structure of one - dimensional arcs in fourier space .",
    "( a ) @xmath56 pattern dominates , i.e. , @xmath85 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath86 , and @xmath87 . apparently , there is only one curve corresponding to @xmath88 after ft .",
    "( b ) @xmath57 pattern dominates , i.e. , @xmath89 . in this case , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "only @xmath92 shows up after ft .",
    "( c ) @xmath58 pattern dominates , i.e. , @xmath93 . in this case , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "only @xmath96 shows up after ft .",
    "( d ) all three patterns including @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 dominate , i.e. , @xmath97 . in this case , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "all three curves corresponding to @xmath88 , @xmath92 and @xmath96 can be observed after ft .",
    "this is explicitly demonstrated in fig.[ft ] , which is based upon the discrete fourier transform method : @xmath100 where @xmath101 . as labeled in the figure",
    ", different curves correspond to different phase patterns , which is in good agreement with our analysis above . in the multi - anticrossing system ,",
    "if n anticrossings take part in the lzs interference , @xmath39 phase components can be observed in its ft and vice versa .",
    "therefore , ft provides a means to ascertain how many tlss are effectively coupled to qubit .",
    "in summary , we present a simple form of analytic expression for describing the coherent dynamics of a driven multi - anticrossing chain .",
    "the oscillatory population of the hybrid system remained at the initial state exhibits a rich pattern of lzs interference in the two - dimensional phase space parameterized by pulse width and driving amplitude . in the n - anticrossing chain ,",
    "the resulted compound interference is the addition of @xmath39 patterns governed by two transmitted paths , whose weights rely on the lz transition amplitude .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by their fourier transforms of the pulse width , which serve as a useful tool in offering information on energy spectrum .",
    "although the intrinsically random nature of tlss precludes the direct control of their distribution and coupling strength with qubit , our discussion of possible types of special hybrid qubit can be used to understand some observed patterns and to predict future experimental phenomena , in particular considering the rapid technological advancement of a macroscopic device with an atomic - sized system@xcite .",
    "moreover , it is straightforward to apply our method to a superconducting flux qubit , where resonant tunneling between its double well potential forms a multi - anticrossing net . although effort has been devoted to study that system@xcite , our universal model can give a more general description of the system .",
