    "in the last few years much attention has been focussed on the anomalous temperature dependence of the optical sum rule @xcite . in particular , in a number of superconductors in the underdoped and optimally doped regime the sum rule exhibits a temperature dependence which is anomalous with respect to that expected from a conventional bcs condensation .",
    "the origin of this behaviour has been the subject of a number of theoretical explanations @xcite .",
    "it is probably fair to say that there is no consensus concerning the origin of the observed anomaly below the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath1 .    perhaps equally intriguing",
    "is the normal state temperature dependence.@xcite most often the value of the sum rule is plotted versus @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the absolute temperature , and a linear relationship is observed .",
    "@xcite this appears natural as a straightforward sommerfeld expansion produces a finite temperature correction which is quadratic in temperature .",
    "however , several researchers @xcite have noticed that the observed temperature dependence is too strong compared with what one would expect with realistic bandwidths in the cuprate materials ( for a quantitative analysis of experimental data in cuprates see ref . ) . moreover , there are clear deviations from @xmath2 dependence , @xcite along with some indications of a linear temperature variation of the spectral weight @xcite so that one is left with the question : within a fermi liquid approach , what governs the temperature dependence of the optical sum rule in the normal state ?",
    "this is the question we address in this paper . to be concrete we use an exchange boson model ( migdal approximation for phonons ) , which is a weak - coupling approach",
    "this approach is believed to be applicable to phonons , whose possible relevance to the cuprates has been questioned in the last few years @xcite .",
    "it is more suspect from a theoretical point of view for magnon exchange ; nonetheless we simply adopt the migdal approximation , with justification provided by some researchers @xcite .",
    "this type of calculation has also recently been carried out by karakozov and maksimov @xcite .",
    "we reinforce their ( and our ) main message : a strong temperature dependence of the optical sum rule can arise due to interactions .",
    "we examine in further detail the dependence on the various parameters of the model . in particular , we show that the finite width of the band , which is crucial for discussing the sum - rule temperature dependence , introduces new features in the electron self - energy , which are usually overlooked in the infinite - bandwidth approximation .",
    "moreover , we show that the sum - rule temperature dependence can not be attributed merely to the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the self energy .",
    "indeed , the real part enters in a critical way .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section we outline the formalism , both on the real and imaginary axes .",
    "the former is more appropriate for analytical work , whereas the latter is ideal for numerical work .",
    "we show results for a wide variety of parameters , which clearly shows how the temperature dependence can go from quadratic to linear in temperature , depending on the boson frequency scale .",
    "we also outline how the sommerfeld contribution can be determined ( even in the presence of interactions ) .",
    "it is small always since we use the fermi energy as a dominant energy scale .",
    "we also show how a large but non - infinite energy scale actually qualitatively changes ` low energy ' results . in section iii",
    "we adopt a sequence of approximations to illustrate precisely what is required to achieve qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerical results .",
    "we find that the real part of the single particle self energy is required for a clear understanding of the temperature dependence of the sum rule",
    ". finally , we close with a summary .",
    "the `` single band '' sum rule @xcite can be written @xmath3 = { \\pi e^{2 } \\over 4\\hbar^2 } \\biggl\\ { \\frac{4}{n}\\sum_{k } { \\partial^2\\epsilon_k \\over \\partial k_x^2 } n_{k}. \\biggr\\}\\label{sumrule}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the tight - binding dispersion and @xmath5 is the single spin momentum distribution function . in the case of two dimensions with nearest neighbour hopping only",
    ", the quantity in braces is given by the _ negative _ of the expectation value of the kinetic energy @xmath6we have explored elsewhere that the kinetic energy is a good monitor of the sum rule , even in cases beyond nearest neighbour hopping.@xcite therefore in what follows we will use eq .",
    "( [ kinetic_energy ] ) , as it is much simpler to calculate for a given model than the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) . in general , the momentum distribution function is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the single electron matsubara green function with momentum @xmath9 and frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath10 are the fermionic matsubara frequencies , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an integer , @xmath0 is the temperature ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 is the inverse temperature . the spectral function , @xmath15 , is related to the analytical continuation of the matsubara green function .",
    "finally , @xmath16 is the fermi - dirac distribution function . in the absence of interactions",
    "the spectral function is a temperature - independent dirac delta function , so that @xmath17 and eq .",
    "( [ kinetic_energy ] ) reduces to : @xmath18 it is then clear that the only temperature dependence of the sum rule ( [ non - int ] ) can be due to the `` thermal smearing '' , i.e. the effect contained within the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "a sommerfeld expansion then reveals this temperature dependence to be quadratic in @xmath19 , @xcite where @xmath20 is the electronic bandwidth ; this parameter is usually small at temperatures of interest ( up to @xmath21 k ) .",
    "however , in the general case of an interacting system eq .",

    "this quantity , and consequently the spectral function @xmath27 , will be in general temperature dependent , and it is this temperature dependence that will manifest itself in the total kinetic energy ( [ int])(and therefore the conductivity sum ) that we wish to understand.@xcite indeed , using for simplicity a constant density of states in eq.([int ] ) , an application of the sommerfeld expansion produces @xcite @xmath28where the second term is what we refer to in what follows as the sommerfeld term ( with chemical potential assumed to be zero , in the middle of the band ) and @xmath29 in the non - interacting case @xmath30 reduces to @xmath31 , so that the @xmath32 dependence of the sommerfeld term is recovered , as stated above . in the interacting case instead",

    "( [ non - int ] ) .",
    "however , in the general case it is given by @xmath36the key observation , also made ( independently ) by karakozov and maksimov @xcite is that eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) can have a far more significant temperature dependence than the sommerfeld contribution .",
    "moreover , as we shall investigate here , due to this effect the temperature dependence of the kinetic energy can deviate from the non - interacting case .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "this work will focus on `` conventional '' interactions , modelled after the electron - phonon interaction , as described by an einstein oscillator with frequency @xmath37 and coupling strength @xmath38 . in the non - selfconsistent migdal approximation ,",
    "the self energy is given by : @xmath39where the non - selfconsistency is reflected in the fact that the non - interacting electron green function is used ( hence the subscript zero ) .",
    "this can be made self - consistent but the changes are minor because of the large bandwidth we will always adopt ( in other words we are not pursuing the possibility of strong temperature dependence arising from a low electronic energy scale ) . here @xmath40where @xmath25 is anywhere in the complex plane .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath20 is included in eq .",
    "( [ migdal ] ) since it is customary to have a density of states factor in @xmath38 ( which , among other things , makes it dimensionless ) , and so we use the ` average ' density of states , @xmath41 .",
    "one can readily evaluate eq .",
    "( [ migdal ] ) for various tight - binding models and use this in eqs .",
    "( [ dyson],[momentum_distribution],[kinetic_energy ] ) . however , we simplify further before presenting results and advise the reader that such details make little difference in our conclusions . to this end",
    "we assume a constant density of states for energies @xmath42 .",

    "the result is @xmath44where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the bose and fermi functions , respectively .",
    "( [ migdala ] ) can be evaluated either at the matsubara frequencies @xmath47 , with @xmath12 an integer , or at the real frequencies attained through direct analytical continuation , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 an infinitesimal imaginary part . to obtain reliable numerical results",
    "the most straightforward approach is on the imaginary axis , as we now describe .",
    "first , one evaluates the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ migdala ] ) numerically .",
    "one can show that the result is pure imaginary ( because of the particle - hole symmetry ) , and so one can define a `` renormalization '' function through @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a real - valued function .",
    "next one returns to the kinetic energy ; the momentum dependence ( i.e. the @xmath43 dependence ) in eq .",
    "( [ kinetic_energy ] ) is simple enough ( see the first line of eq .",
    "( [ momentum_distribution ] ) with @xmath43 dependence coming only from the explicit dependence shown in eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) ) to be done analytically .",
    "the result is : @xmath52.\\label{kin1}\\]]this is easily summed provided asymptotics are used for the contribution at high frequencies .",
    "( [ kin1 ] ) with @xmath51 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ migdala ] ) provides us with our numerical results .",
    "it is difficult to develop an intuition for what temperature dependence may emerge from various parameter choices .",
    "in particular we have uncertainty about the energy scale of the boson . before developing some analytical approximations",
    "we therefore show some results .",
    "1 shows the ( negative of the ) kinetic energy vs. temperature for several coupling strengths : @xmath53 and @xmath54 as labeled .",
    "we have used a consistent set of parameters for these results : ( i ) a bandwidth @xmath55 ev , and ( ii ) a boson frequency @xmath56 mev .",
    "the first most noticeable trend is that the absolute value of the kinetic energy decreases with increasing coupling strength .",
    "this is expected , as coupling to a boson decoheres the electrons . while the momentum distribution function retains a discontinuity at the fermi level ( see , for example , fig . 1 in ref .",
    ") , the overall distribution is considerably more smeared than in the non - interacting case .",
    "thus , in the ground state , higher kinetic energy ( i.e. lower absolute value ) states are occupied while low kinetic energy states remain unoccupied .",
    "this sort of trend with coupling strength would be very difficult to observe in the experiments , however , as there is no simple way to compare two systems whose only difference is the coupling strength .",
    "a more promising property to focus on is the temperature dependence , which clearly varies as the coupling strength increases . before doing this",
    "we wish to make one important remark concerning our parameter choices .",
    "note that the bandwidth has been chosen to be by far the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "this is generally the case in ` conventional ' metals .",
    "interesting effects can arise when the bandwidth is not so large compared to the other energy scales ( such as the boson frequency or the temperature itself ) @xcite .",
    "however , here we wish to demonstrate that even in the ` conventional ' case a significant temperature dependence of the kinetic energy appears due to interactions .        as we explained above , for the non - interacting case the deviation of @xmath57 from a constant",
    "is given by the @xmath32 sommerfeld contribution .",
    "@xcite the finite - temperature corrections for the interacting cases shown in fig .",
    "1 are clearly not simply quadratic , and furthermore the magnitude of the variation increases substantially with coupling strength .",
    "is this due to alterations in the sommerfeld contribution ?",
    "the answer is most definitively no .",
    "indeed , even though the sommerfeld correction ( to be further described below ) changes by at most @xmath58 ( at @xmath59 k ) from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , this gives a correction of about @xmath62 mev ( at @xmath59 k ) for @xmath63 , whereas the deviation from the zero temperature result is @xmath64 mev .",
    "thus the bulk of the temperature correction arises from other sources .",
    "how does the energy scale of the einstein frequency @xmath37 affect the temperature dependence ?",
    "2 we show the ( negative of the ) kinetic energy vs. temperature for several einstein frequencies with the same bandwidth as before , and with a moderate coupling strength , @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear that the energy scale of the boson frequency has a profound effect both on the zero temperature value and the temperature dependence itself .",
    "in particular , for low boson frequencies the temperature dependence is linear ; in addition , as will be made clear below , the temperature dependence comes almost entirely from @xmath34 , not the sommerfeld term .",
    "in contrast , for high boson frequency the temperature dependence resembles that of the non - interacting case and a significant fraction comes from the sommerfeld term .",
    "mev , and ( b ) @xmath66 mev .",
    "note the ( very ) slight deterioration of the approximate result as the boson frequency increases .",
    "also note that for low boson frequency the mass enhancement parameter becomes negative for high temperatures ( but ` high ' being defined relative to the boson , not the electronic energy scale ) .",
    "counterintuitively , the result for infinite bandwidth ( dashed green curve ) becomes poorer as the boson energy scale _ decreases_. ]    to see how this significant temperature variation arises , let us go back to the real - axis formulation ( [ int])-([koft ] ) of the kinetic energy and let us analyze the sommerfeld contribution . to obtain the self energy on the real axis a straightforward analytical continuation of eq .",
    "( [ migdala ] ) is required , @xmath67writing the real and imaginary parts as @xmath68 , it is easy to see that @xmath69 is zero at zero frequency . furthermore , @xmath70 . defining , as usual , @xmath71 , then we obtain , @xmath72 ^ 2},\\label{ksomm1}\\]]substitution into the second term of eq .",
    "( [ koft ] ) yields , for the sommerfeld contribution , @xmath73here , the zero frequency imaginary part of the self energy ( denoted simply by @xmath74 ) is required ; for a constant density of states the ( exact ) result is given by the result known as being a good approximation for the infinite bandwidth case @xcite , @xmath75at low temperatures this is zero , while at high temperatures ( with respect to the boson frequency , @xmath37 ) , this is linear in temperature .",
    "the real part of the self energy , required to determine @xmath76 , is more difficult . for @xmath77 ( the physically relevant case )",

    "the two thin lines show how the zero temperature value is modified by the sommerfeld term by a very small amount ; the full numerical result is given by the thick red curve .",
    "a similar contribution is found for the non - interacting case ( actually , there it is a bit larger ) by the dotted ( blue ) curves .",
    "however , here the relative effect is much larger because only the sommerfeld term is responsible for the temperature variation .",
    "finally , for higher boson frequency , the dashed ( green ) curves illustrate the amount of temperature variation due to the sommerfeld term compared with the rest . ]    where @xmath80 is the fermi function .",
    "this expression is not very enlightening .",
    "however note that the first line is strongly convergent , so much so that the @xmath81 term is not really required for most parameter regimes of interest .",
    "the matsubara sum can then be performed , and one obtains for this first term ( without the @xmath38 out front ) , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the diagamma function ; this is the result one obtains for the infinite bandwidth case .",
    "it is positive definite , starts at unity at zero temperature ( so @xmath85 ) and goes to zero as @xmath86 at high temperature .",
    "the other two terms vanish for infinite bandwidth .",
    "in fact the third term is very small for all temperatures with conventional parameters , while the second term dominates at high temperature .",
    "this is clear since it increases ( in magnitude ) linearly with temperature . a plot is shown in fig .",
    "3 . also shown is the approximation @xmath87where we have used eq .",
    "( [ sig20 ] ) .",
    "this approximation is shown by the symbols and is clearly excellent over the entire temperature range .",
    "the important feature apparent in fig .",
    "3 is that the mass enhancement parameter @xmath76 changes sign as the temperature increases .",
    "this is a non - trivial effect ; cappelluti et al .",
    "@xcite noted a similar phenomenon when impurity scattering was included ( we remind the reader that at high temperature low frequency phonons behave much like static impurities ) .",
    "this behaviour is necessary to include to describe the numerical results accurately , as we shall see below .",
    "it is truly remarkable that at temperatures below @xmath88 k a modest scattering ( @xmath89 ) off low frequency phonons ( @xmath90 mev ) exhibits a qualitative change ( mass enhancement changes sign ) when an electronic cutoff energy ( normally taken to be infinite ) is introduced which is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger ( 1 ev ) than the low energy parameters .",
    "once we have exactly determined the quasiparticle renormalization parameter @xmath76 we can estimate the sommerfeld contribution .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "4 , where we compare again the non - interacting case with the @xmath89 cases at two phonon frequencies . as one can see , in the non - interacting case the sommerfeld term , even if small , is the only source of the temperature variation of the kinetic energy . when interactions are present instead its contribution can not account for the temperature variation of @xmath57 obtained through the numerical computation of eq .",
    "( [ kin1 ] ) .",
    "we then conclude that to understand the origin of the strong temperature dependence displayed in figs .  1 - 2 , one must examine eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) .",
    "note that a different conclusion was instead drawn in ref .",
    ", where a hubbard - like interaction between electrons was considered . indeed , in this case the main effect of the interaction is to reduce the effective quasiparticle bandwidth @xmath91 , so that as @xmath92 increases the sommerfeld term continues to provide the largest contribution to the temperature variation of the kinetic energy .",
    "the linear temperature dependence , and , indeed , the strongest temperature dependence , occurs for low boson frequency , so we focus on this parameter regime . to put this another way , one should examine temperatures which are high compared to the boson frequency , which fig .",
    "2 illustrates is readily attained in the @xmath93 k range when @xmath94 mev .",
    "then it is clear that the imaginary part of the self energy at zero frequency increases linearly with temperature ( see eq .",
    "( [ sig20 ] ) ) and one is tempted to associate the linear temperature dependence observed in @xmath57 with the linear temperature dependence in @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , karakozov and maksimov @xcite noted that the _ infinite _ frequency limit of the self energy ( as defined by the theory with infinite bandwidth ) , which we will denote by @xmath95 , also increases linearly with temperature , and they use this quantity .",
    "it is given by @xmath96 we should be clear here ; the physical self energy always has an imaginary part which goes to zero beyond the electronic bandwidth energy scale .",

    "( [ s2inf ] ) or ( [ sig20 ] ) provides the correct high temperature behaviour for the imaginary part of the self energy .",
    "however , as we now illustrate , using this part of the self energy alone is not sufficient to properly reproduce the numerical result .",

    "note that the numerical result is that for @xmath34 ; this differs from the results presented in figs . 1 - 2 by essentially the sommerfeld term , which we leave out of this discussion .",

    "@xmath143 clearly deteriorate as the boson frequency increases with respect to the temperature scale involved .",
    "note in particular that in the temperature regime where the result is no longer linear in temperature the qualitative agreement is not so good ( i.e. off by more than a percent ) .",
    "it is also apparent in this figure that the crude approximation for the real part of the self energy ( first part of eq .",
    "( [ real_lin ] ) ) results in some minor discrepancies at higher temperatures . as mentioned before , replacement of this linear approximation with a single logarithm ( still an approximate result )",
    "makes the ` analytic ' results agree essentially perfectly with the numerical results .",
    "in the previous sections we have described the effects of the interaction of electrons with a soft collective mode on the electronic kinetic energy , which is in turn related to the optical sum rule probed by the experiments . in contrast to the general expectation for fermi - liquid systems , here the main contribution to the temperature variation of the kinetic energy can not be attributed to the sommerfeld term , i.e. to the thermal smearing of the fermi occupation number . instead , the relevant effects come from the temperature dependence set by the interaction itself , via the electronic self energy . while discussing the sum rule behavior",
    "the presence of a finite bandwidth @xmath20 is a crucial ingredient , since the temperature variations are expected to vary as a power of @xmath19 or @xmath146 .",
    "the latter case is relevant here , with the kinetic energy , as given by eq.s  ( [ k0c1])-([koc2 ] ) , scaling as @xmath146 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath147 at high temperatures , we also found a linear temperature depletion of the optical sum .",
    "however , in deriving this result we had to properly take into account also the structure of the real part of the self energy , whose behavior at low frequency is quite strongly affected by the presence of a finite - bandwidth cut - off , in contrast to the general expectation coming from the analysis of the infinite - bandwidth approximation.@xcite    finally , we would like to present a simple argument which can help the reader to understand the difference between the effect of thermal smearing of the fermi function with respect to the effect of the interaction considered here .",
    "going back to the expression ( [ kinetic_energy ] ) of the kinetic energy , we can understand the sommerfeld term as due to the fact that by varying the temperature one has a variation of the occupation factor @xmath148 of order @xmath149 over a range @xmath150 around the fermi level ( here @xmath151 ) and @xmath121 otherwise so that : @xmath152 as a consequence , the @xmath2 power is due to the fact that the integration of energy , which gives @xmath153 , on a range @xmath19 , produces a power of @xmath154 in the kinetic energy .",
    "the question then arises : do interactions similarly simply change the occupation number in a region @xmath155 around the fermi level , which would then lead to a @xmath156 dependence of the kinetic energy for the interacting case ?",
    "the answer we have found is clearly , no . indeed ,",
    "when the occupation number coming from eq.([momentum_distribution ] ) is considered , using the same approximations ( [ s2inf ] ) and ( [ real_lin ] ) considered above for the self - energy we can estimate @xmath157 ( i.e. the contribution coming from the @xmath158 limit of the fermi function , in analogy with the definition ( [ k0 ] ) of @xmath34 ) as : @xmath159,\\ ] ] as a consequence , one can roughly say that @xmath160 , with some coefficient @xmath161 of order 1 , in most of the energy range between @xmath122 and @xmath121 , and not only in a small region around the fermi level .",
    "in other words , the interaction affects the occupation number even far from the fermi level , so that the energy integration in eq .",
    "( [ kinetic_energy ] ) is now scaling as : @xmath162 thus , the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the temperature variation of the imaginary part of the self energy , even though the exact coefficient @xmath161 should be determined taking care also of contributions from the real part of the self - energy . even though the previous relation is not valid for stronger interactions ( as in hubbard - like models @xcite ) , one can reasonably expect that by modeling the inelastic scattering with a more general phonon - like spectrum , the sum rule behavior will roughly follow the modification introduced in the electronic self - energy in the way indicated by eq .",
    "( [ naive ] ) .",
    "this possibility leads to an understanding of the experimental observation of a non - quadratic temperature dependence of the sum rule in some cuprate superconductors , where also the high - energy scattering rate shows a linear temperature scaling @xcite .",
