    "controlling the size , shape and placement of nanoparticles is a main concern in many processes of nanostructures fabrication . for instance",
    ", the incorporation of plasmonic nanoparticles into photovoltaic devices can strongly increase their efficiency  @xcite , since the surface plasmon resonance between metallic nanostructures depends on the size and spacing  @xcite of the particles .",
    "other applications include biodiagnostics and sensing , where au nanoparticles bind to specific dna markers , permitting their detection  @xcite .",
    "the potential applications for organized metallic nanostructures are wide ranging and include raman spectroscopy  @xcite , catalysis  @xcite , photonics  @xcite , and spintronics  @xcite . one strategy to create and organize structures at the nanoscale is to make use of the inherent self",
    " assembly mechanisms of a material .",
    "the combination of natural instabilities related to the physical properties of liquid metals , such as low viscosity and high surface energy , with the technological ability to lithographically pattern nanoscale features , has created an open field of research .",
    "these techniques require the study of the liquid  state dewetting dynamics  @xcite leading to liquid instabilities  @xcite , with the goal of directing the assembly to precise , coordinated nanostructures in one  @xcite and two  @xcite dimensions . within this context , the phenomena of wetting and dewetting of a shaped liquid film ( metallic or not ) covering a solid substrate are at the basis of all these processes and applications . however , even if these phenomena have been studied for the last two decades  @xcite , several of the main issues related to them are still under discussion .",
    "therefore , one of the purposes of this paper is to provide a clear description of the wetting and dewetting mechanisms , including effects of contact angle hysteresis , and their implications in the formation of liquid structures .",
    "we consider in detail the dynamics of a long liquid filament sitting on a horizontal substrate under partial wetting conditions .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on the bulged region at its ends that is formed due to the filament retraction along its longitudinal direction .",
    "this process not only involves a dewetting motion , but also a wetting one in the transverse direction . due to these",
    "advancing and receding motions at the ends , the contact line becomes curved in the region connecting the bulge ( head ) with the rest of the filament .",
    "this perturbation triggers an instability that leads to the appearance of a neck with rapidly decreasing width  @xcite .",
    "the breakup of this neck leads to two fluid portions which evolve separately .",
    "on one side , the head separated from the filament recedes until a final drop shape is achieved .",
    "the main features of this drop , such as its non  circular footprint , was thoroughly studied in previous works  @xcite . on the other side",
    ", the remaining filament has a new shaped end as a result of the breakup process .",
    "the following receding longitudinal motion of this new end of the filament leads to another bulged region and a neck formation in a successive fashion .",
    "a group of pictures of this process , as obtained in this work for a silicon oil on a coated glass , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence](a ) . for comparison",
    ", we also include in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence](b ) the analogous process observed at nanoscale  @xcite for a filament of width @xmath0  nm and thickness @xmath1  nm , which was generated in the context of pulsed laser induce dewetting ( plid ) ( see e.g.  @xcite and references cited there ) .    the main goal of this work is to describe and understand the physical mechanisms involved in the evolution of the head and its retraction .",
    "the flow before and after the breakup is studied experimentally by means of optical techniques , which allow to measure contact line positions , contact angles , thickness profiles and contact line contours .",
    "these data are then compared with a simple heuristic model as well as numerical simulations , which solve the navier  stokes equations with appropriate boundary conditions at the contact line .",
    "note that the modeling of this flow implies the description of the contact line movement , and the subsequent pressure and velocity fields in a fluid domain confined by the substrate and the fluid free surface .",
    "thus , the main issue in this modeling is how to determine the contact line motion , where both the stress and viscous dissipation rate diverge in the continuum description if slip is not allowed . here",
    ", we consider a small amount of slip within the navier boundary condition , and consistently add a relationship between the velocity and the contact angle . since these relations must account for wetting and dewetting , we choose the combined approach proposed in  @xcite , which accounts for both the hydrodynamic of the macroscopic region  @xcite and the molecular kinetic  @xcite for the contact line motion .",
    "the relevant physical parameters in this approach , which leads to a constitutive relationship for the contact line dynamics , are determined here by an additional study of the hysteretic behavior of a sessile drop .    in section  [ sec : wet ]",
    ", we obtain the main wettability properties of the substrate and liquid ( silicon oil ) system to be used in the filament experiments described in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "the experimental data are compared both with a simple heuristic model ( section  [ sec : model ] ) and numerical simulations of the navier  stokes equations ( section  [ sec : num ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : conclu ] is devoted to a summary and main conclusions of the work .",
    "in order to perform the experiments , we employ a similar setup to that reported in  @xcite , i.e. we use a substrate that is partially wetted by our working fluid , namely a silicon oil ( polydimethylsiloxane , pdms ) .",
    "the substrate is a microscope slide ( glass ) which is coated with a fluorinated solution ( egc-1700 of 3 m ) using a chemat dip coater under controlled speed .",
    "the pdms partially wets the substrate , since the coating lowers the surface energy of the glass .",
    "in order to have reproducible wetting properties , we found that it is necessary to follow a protocol to get rid of the remaining solvent in the coating .",
    "thus , the coated substrates are heated in an oven at @xmath2c for @xmath3 minutes , and left on a close and dry vessel for about @xmath4 days .",
    "both the surface tension , @xmath5 , and density , @xmath6 , of the pdms are measured with a krss  k11 tensiometer , while its viscosity , @xmath7 , is determined with a haake vt550 rotating viscometer .",
    "the values obtained for these parameters are : @xmath8  dyn / cm , @xmath9  g/@xmath10 , and @xmath11  poise at temperature @xmath12c .    in order to characterize the wettability of the pdms",
    ", we employ a technique which advances or recedes the contact line by changing the volume of a sessile drop initially placed on the substrate  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by injecting or withdrawing liquid through of a needle ( connected to a syringe ) in contact with the apex of the drop ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst_static](a ) ) .",
    "the syringe volume is controlled by an automated dispensing system of a rame ",
    "hart model 250 goniometer , and the measurements are based on the analysis of the axisymmetric drop shape profile ( adsa  p technique ) .",
    "we distinguish here two scenarios : one in which the injection / withdrawal process is produced by pulses ( between which the drop is allowed to reach a static shape ) , and another one where this process is practically continuous . thus , in the first case we focus on the measurement of the static contact angle , @xmath13 , while in the second case we are concerned with the dynamic angle , @xmath14 , and its relationship with the drop contact line velocity .",
    "we start with a drop of volume @xmath15l and use injection / withdrawal pulses of @xmath16  s duration at a flow rate @xmath17l / s .",
    "this is done by means of an automated control of the piston motion in the syringe .",
    "the pulses are separated by time intervals of about @xmath18  s , so that the drop has time enough to relax to its static shape after every volume variation , @xmath19l .",
    "initially at @xmath20 , we have a sessile drop of volume @xmath21 with @xmath22 and null contact line displacement ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "as the volume is increased , it spreads and reaches intermediate rest states on a dry surface ( not previously covered by the pdms ) till the maximum volume , @xmath24l , is achieved .",
    "this is shown by the blue symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst_static](a ) for @xmath13 ( full circles ) and @xmath25 ( hollow circles ) , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath13 remains practically the same for all these volumes , while @xmath25 increases .",
    "this stage is not part of the hysteresis cycle , since only contact line motions on a previously wetted surface are considered in its determination .",
    "after this preliminary stage , the needle withdraws liquid until @xmath26 diminishes to @xmath27  @xmath28l ( see the portion of the cycle from a to b in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst_static](a ) : clockwise for @xmath14 , and counterclockwise for @xmath25 , as indicated by the arrows ) . finally , the increasing volume stage ( from b to a ) starts at @xmath29 till @xmath30 is reached again .",
    "this process can be repeated indefinitely , but only the first hysteresis cycle is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hyst_static](a ) for brevity ( the full black circles stand for @xmath13 , while the hollow red ones correspond to @xmath25 ) . in order to fully understand the meaning of these curves in terms of the local behavior at the contact line , we plot @xmath13 versus @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst_static](b ) , and ignore @xmath26 since it is not a relevant parameter for this analysis . here",
    ", we see that the front starts to have a forward displacement ( advance ) at @xmath31 to achieve a new static position , so that this angle is called the ( static ) advancing contact angle .",
    "similarly , we define the ( static ) receding contact angle , @xmath32 , as the value of @xmath13 at which the front must have a backwards displacement ( recede ) to achieve equilibrium . as it will be shown in the following sections , these two limiting angles are related to the dynamic contact angle behavior .",
    "another relevant couple of angles is given by the maximum and minimum values of @xmath13 , between which static drop states are possible .",
    "this range is @xmath33 .",
    "now , we consider the relationship between the dynamic contact angle , @xmath14 , and the contact line velocity , @xmath34 . here , we inject / withdraw the liquid at the same flow rate , @xmath35 , as before , but with longer and larger pulses . except for the first pulse ( at @xmath20 ) , which has a duration of @xmath36  s with a volume increase of @xmath37  @xmath28l , all the other ones last @xmath38  s with a volume variation of @xmath39  @xmath28l ( see dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : hyst_dyn ] ) .",
    "unlike the static case , we continuously measure the dynamic contact angle , @xmath40 , and the corresponding contact line displacement,@xmath41 , as the drop spreads / contracts and relaxes to equilibrium for about @xmath42  s. the values of @xmath14 and @xmath43 as a function of time are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : hyst_dyn ] .",
    "note that during the injection and withdrawal stages @xmath14 varies in phase ( without delay ) with @xmath26 , while the effect of @xmath44 on the contact line displacement , @xmath43 , is delayed .",
    "this is due to the fact that during these stages the drop volume variation is quickly absorbed by a modification of the contact angle , while the contact line does not move till @xmath14 reaches the critical contact angle ( @xmath45 for advancing , and @xmath46 for receding ) .",
    "we derive numerically the data of @xmath43 versus @xmath47 to obtain the contact line velocity , @xmath48 .",
    "the hollow circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_vcl ] show @xmath14 as a function of @xmath34 , using @xmath47 as a parameter .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath14 range for which @xmath49 is practically coincident with the hysteresis range of @xmath13 , namely @xmath50 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst_static](b ) .",
    "this agreement confirms that the methodology used to determine both types of angles , namely static and dynamic , is appropriate to describe the wettability of the substrate by the pdms .",
    ", as a function of the contact line velocity of the drop , @xmath34 ( hollow circles ) .",
    "these data correspond to four cycles of the injection / withdrawal continuous flow at the drop apex .",
    "the arrow points to the maximum dewetting velocity , @xmath51 , which corresponds to @xmath52 . ]    in order to fully describe the dewetting stage , we must enlarge the velocity range for @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , it is known that the dewetting velocity has a maximum absolute value at which the dynamic contact angle is zero  @xcite , and our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_vcl ] for the dynamic cycle of the sessile drop can not show this phenomenon .    with this goal",
    ", we perform a different experiment which allows to obtain the maximum velocity of dewetting , referred here to as @xmath51 ( @xmath54 ) . in this new setup ,",
    "we plunge a coated substrate into a deep pool of pdms , and withdraw it at a speed , @xmath55 , greater than @xmath51 .",
    "this is achieved when , for a certain @xmath55 , the liquid is entrained off the pool , and forms a film on the substrate . once the substrate has stopped , the contact line of this film starts to slide down the surface due to gravity .",
    "this dewetting motion proceeds at the maximum possible velocity , @xmath51 , with zero contact angle  @xcite .",
    "we perform experiments with different withdrawal speeds ( @xmath56  cm / s ) , and confirmed that the value of @xmath51 is independent of @xmath55 , as expected .",
    "the contact lines on both sides of the coated glass are seen on the digital image due to the transparency of the substrate .",
    "they are not exactly coincident , thus introducing some error in the measurement , which is at most @xmath57 and increases as the front dewets .",
    "finally , by measuring the contact line position as a function of time , we are able to obtain the linear regression expression @xmath58 this value of @xmath51 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_vcl ] for @xmath52 , and it is of great importance to determine the parameters of the physical mechanism that describes the @xmath14@xmath34 relationship , as will be shown in the following section .      in order to describe the motion of the contact line over the substrate ( @xmath59-plane ) , we employ two constitutive relations to account for the liquid  solid interaction .",
    "firstly , we overcome the stress singularity by relaxing the no slip boundary condition at the substrate through the navier formulation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the slip length .",
    "this parameter embraces somehow the main features related with the intermolecular forces in that region .",
    "secondly , we use a relationship between the dynamic contact angle , @xmath14 , and the contact line velocity , @xmath34 , which is normal to the contact line itself .",
    "since we need to describe not only advancing motions ( wetting , @xmath62 ) , but also receding ( dewetting , @xmath53 ) ones , we define the dynamic contact angle from a combination of the hydrodynamic and molecular kinetics models  @xcite as first proposed in  @xcite . for the former",
    ", we have the cox - voinov relationship  @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the microscopic contact angle , and @xmath65 , @xmath61 are macroscopic and microscopic length scales , respectively .",

    "[ fig : theta_vcl ] , which show a sharp jump at @xmath49 due to hysteresis effects .",
    "then , we must resort to an alternative approach .",
    "in fact , several authors  @xcite admit the possibility of a non  hydrodynamic velocity dependence of @xmath64 . here , we consider that it is given by the blake molecular  kinetics model  @xcite in the form , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the ( microscopic ) equilibrium contact angle ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the other parameters , which are of molecular origin , are given by  @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the frequency of molecular displacement at equilibrium , @xmath74 is the average length of each molecular displacement ( or distance between adsortion sites ) , @xmath75 is the temperature , and @xmath76 is the boltzmann s constant . since we do not focus our attention in the kinetic process itself , we consider @xmath77 and @xmath78 as fitting parameters of our modeling . on the other hand ,",
    "since the surface energies are usually associated with the cosine of a contact angle , as in young s law , we consider the cosine of the equilibrium angle , @xmath70 , as an average of the cosines of two characteristic angles of the hysteresis range .",

    "the main dynamical process that we analyze here is the axial dewetting motion of a liquid filament placed on a horizontal and previously coated glass substrate  @xcite .",
    "we generate the filament from a vertical jet of pdms flowing out from a small nozzle at the bottom of a vessel filled with pdms .",
    "it is captured on the substrate by horizontally flipping the substrate in a rigid frame . quickly afterwards",
    ", the frame is rotated @xmath94 degrees and a second horizontal flip is performed so that a new ( auxiliary ) filament , perpendicular to the first one , is also captured on the substrate .",
    "this other filament crosses the first one near one of its ends , so that the latter adopts a reproducible and characteristic rounded shape , whose axial dewetting will be observed and measured in detail . finally , the substrate is rapidly placed on a horizontal position .",
    "all these movements take about @xmath95 seconds , which is a very short time interval compared to the time scale of the experiment itself due to the high viscosity of the pdms .",
    "thus , we obtain a fluid filament of uniform width , @xmath96 , with parallel and straight contact lines , so that the initial configuration has a constant cross sectional area along its axis .",
    "we calibrate the system by relating the fluid height in the vessel and the jet diameter for a given nozzle .",
    "both the jet diameter and the corresponding filament widths ( for a contact angle equal to @xmath45 ) could be varied from @xmath97 to @xmath98  mm and from @xmath99 to @xmath100  mm , respectively .",
    "a typical dewetting process of the filament end is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence ] .",
    "initially , it is rounded and has a contact angle of around @xmath101 so that the tip certainly recedes according to the wettability framework described above ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_vcl ] ) .",
    "this motion induces the development of a head , whose width and thickness grow with time .",
    "the evolution proceeds until the filament tip stops and , after a while , a narrower region ( neck ) starts forming in the filament somewhere beyond the bulged region . finally , the neck breaks up , so that the portion of fluid between the tip and the neck gives place to a static drop .",
    "the characteristic shape of this sessile drop with non - circular footprint was previously studied in  @xcite , but here we will focus on the description of the dynamical process previous to the rupture . this dewetting and breakup mechanism repeats itself starting from a new end of the filament , and finishes with the formation of a series of similar drops . here , we show results for the tracking of the first four heads at the left end of this filament .    the experimental setup allows to observe , though not simultaneously , both top and side views of the filament evolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : side_top ] , we show the filament profiles for two similar , albeit not strictly equal , widths . from this type of profiles , we are able to extract the position of the tip , the contact angle there , as well as the thickness and width of the head .",
    "these parameters are later compared with the results from an heuristic model and numerical simulations of the full hydrodynamic equations .",
    "it should be noted that the first drop formed from the end of the filament is a consequence of a different breakup process ( numbered here as head @xmath102 ) than the following ones .",
    "this is due to the fact that its preceding breakup occurs at crossings with a transversal auxiliary filament , unlike the rest of the drops .",
    "since the initial conditions of the formation process determines important features of the dynamics , such as the distance travelled by the retracing tip till the following breakup , we shall restrict ourselves to the most repetitive case .",

    "in order to develop a simple model that accounts for the main features of the dynamic process of dewetting , we consider that the shape of the head at the end of the filament can be approximated as a part of an ellipsoidal cap ( see fig .  [",

    "<S> we study the hydrodynamic mechanisms involved in the motion of the contact line formed at the end region of a liquid filament laying on a planar and horizontal substrate . </S>",
    "<S> since the flow develops under partially wetting conditions , the tip of the filament recedes and forms a bulged region ( head ) , that subsequently develops a neck region behind it . </S>",
    "<S> later on , the neck breaks up leading to a separated drop , while the rest of the filament restarts the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> one main feature of this flow is that the whole dynamics and final drop shapes are strongly influenced by the hysteresis of the contact angle typical in most of the liquid / substrate systems . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution till breakup is studied experimentally and pictured in terms of a hybrid wettability theory which involves the cox  </S>",
    "<S> voinov hydrodynamic approach combined with the molecular kinetic theory developed by blake . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of this theory are determined for our liquid / substrate system ( silicon oil / coated glass ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results of the retracting filament are described in terms of a simple heuristic model , and also compared with numerical simulations of the full navier  stokes equations . </S>",
    "<S> this study is of special interest in the context of pulsed laser induce dewetting ( plid ) . </S>"
