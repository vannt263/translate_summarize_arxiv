    "the basic framework of the optimal execution ( liquidation ) problem was established in bertsimas and lo@xcite and the theory of optimal execution has been developed by almgren and chriss@xcite , he and mamaysky@xcite , huberman and stanzl@xcite , subramanian and jarrow@xcite and many others .",
    "such a problem often shows up in trading operations , when a trader tries to execute a large amount of a security . in these cases , he / she should be careful about liquidity problems and especially should never neglect the market impact ( mi ) which plays an important role .",
    "mi means the effect that a trader s investment behavior affects on security prices .    to study mi for a trader s execution policy",
    ", we consider a case where a trader sells his / her shares of the security by predicting a decrease in price of the security . in a frictionless market ,",
    "a ( risk neutral ) trader should sell all the shares as soon as possible , so his / her optimal strategy is the block liquidation at the initial time .",
    "however , in the real market a trader takes time to liquidate .",
    "so it is significant to find out what factors cause such gradual liquidation .",
    "convexity of mi is one of the reasons to dissuade a trader from block liquidation .",
    "as shown in examples in kato@xcite , when a trader is risk neutral and the market is black scholes type , a quadratic mi function causes gradual liquidation whereas a block liquidation is optimal when mi is linear .",
    "however , many traders in the real market execute their sales by taking time in spite of recognizing that mi is not always convex . risk aversion of a trader s utility function also affects a trader s execution policy motivating an incentive to take more time for trading . schied and schneborn@xcite consider an optimization problem in relation with a risk averse utility function and clarify the relation between the measure of risk aversion and the form of optimal strategies .",
    "another important motive is that due to the effect of mi , security price may recover after downward movement in price . in this paper , to consider the price recovery effect , we focus on the case where the process of a security price has the mean reverting property , especially when it follows a geometric ornstein uhlenbeck ( ou ) process .",
    "we adopt the framework of kato@xcite : we first consider discrete time models of an optimal execution problem and then derive the continuous time model as their limit . to treat the geometric ou process as a security price process",
    ", we generalize the main results of kato@xcite mathematically .",
    "we explicitly solve the optimization problem with linear mi and show that the optimal strategy is a mixture of initial / terminal block liquidation and intermediate gradual liquidation .",
    "our example in this paper is also placed as a representative case where a gradual liquidation is necessary in the framework of kato@xcite even if there is linear mi and the trader is risk neutral .",
    "our result is strongly related to studies of the limit order book ( lob ) model . in the lob model ,",
    "a trader s selling decreases buy limit orders , thus expanding the bid ask spread temporarily , and new buy limit orders appear , letting the bid ask spread shrinks as time passes .",
    "the minimization problem of expected execution cost in a block - shaped lob model with exponential resilience of mi is studied in obizhaeva and wang@xcite .",
    "a mathematical generalization of the results of obizhaeva and wang@xcite is given in alfonsi et al.@xcite and predoiu et al.@xcite .",
    "moreover , makimoto and sugihara@xcite treat a model of optimal execution under stochastic liquidity .",
    "it is interesting that despite the fact that the model in this paper is different from the lob model , the form of an optimal execution strategy in our model becomes quite similar to the results in these papers . indeed , when our security price process has no volatility , the form of our optimal strategy coincides with those in alfonsi et al.@xcite and obizhaeva and wang@xcite : the speed of intermediate liquidation is constant .",
    "when the volatility is larger than zero , the speed decreases as in makimoto and sugihara@xcite .",
