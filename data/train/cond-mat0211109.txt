    "dimers are a rather common structure adopted by proteins to perform their biological activity .",
    "they are proteins whose native conformation is a globule build out of two disjoint chains . in particular , homodimers are dimers composed of two identical sequences .",
    "the importance of the study of the evolutionary properties of homodimers is connected with the fact that enzymes of this type produced by viral agents ( e.g. hiv1protease ) are able to display very fast evolutionary patterns to escape from the pressure excerted by the immune system and by drugs .",
    "the knowledge of the evolutionary properties of dimers can thus be of help in designing a strategy to deal with the associated diseases .    some of the known homodimers , like _",
    "e. coli _ trp repressor @xcite , fold according to a three  state mechanism , where first the denaturated chains of the monomers assume conformations rich of native structures independently of each other , and subsequently the two parts come together to form the dimer .",
    "a different behaviour is displayed by , for example , p22 arc repressor , whose chains dimerize without populating any monomeric native  like intermediate ( two  state process ) . in this case",
    "one can only detect the unfolded monomers and the native dimers @xcite . a class by itself is composed by dimers which have evolved by swapping entire domains of each monomer ( `` domain swapping dimers '' , @xcite ) so that a segment of a monomer is replaced by the same segment of the other monomer .",
    "making use of a simple model of protein folding , it has been previously shown @xcite , that the folding of dimeric proteins is , to a large extent , controlled by their ground state energy , as already found for monomeric proteins . in the case of monomers ,",
    "good folders are those sequences which display a low energy in the native state ( i.e. an energy below a threshold @xmath0 , quantity determined mainly by the length of the chain and by the statistical properties of the interaction matrix @xcite ) .",
    "this is also found to be true for dimeric sequences .",
    "moreover , in this case one can distinguish between two and three  state dimers by studying how the relative contact energy is partitioned between the bulk ( i.e. the interactions between residues belonging to the same monomer divided by the corresponding number of contacts ) and the interface ( i.e. the interactions between residues belonging to different monomers divided by the number of interface contacts ) .    from the evolutionary point of view , it is possible to obtain one or the other behaviour concentrating the evolutionary pressure either on the bulk or on the interface amino acids .",
    "if the evolutionary pressure , and consequently the stabilization energy per contact , is concentrated on the bulk , the dimer displays a three  state folding mechanism .",
    "the resulting behaviour is , in this case , similar to that displayed by monomeric chains , where local elementary structures ( les ) , formed and stabilized at early stages of the folding process , essentially control the folding process .",
    "the assembly of the les into the folding nucleus ( fn ) allows the chain to overcome the main free energy barrier in the path towards the monomeric native state @xcite . for three  state dimers",
    "there is an additional step in the folding hierarchy , corresponding to the assembly of the two folded monomers into the native dimer . on the other hand , if the overall relative contact energy is low but the relative energetic balance favours the interface contacts , a two  state dimerization process takes place , where first the interface is built and then the other residues fold around it . in this case a larger number of residues than in the case of three  state dimers are involved in the folding process , essentially all those belonging to the interface , rather than just few , highly conserved , strongly interacting , residues as in the case of three  state folders .",
    "the two cases , however , are not symmetric .",
    "the bulk of the two dimers contains a rich network of interactions , while the interface is kept together by bonds which are , to a large extent independent on each other .",
    "this topological difference gives rise to different evolutionary properties for the residues at the interface with respect to those buried inside the monomers .",
    "the evolutionary features of model dimers can be compared with those of real dimers through the analysis of the conservation patterns in families of analogous proteins .",
    "the model we use to study homodimers is largely employed in the literature @xcite because , in spite of the simplifications introduced in the description of the protein so as to make the calculations feasable , it still contains the two main ingredients which are at the basis of the distinctive properties of proteins : polymeric structure and disordered interactions among the amino acids@xcite . according to this model ,",
    "a protein is a chain of beads on a cubic lattice , each bead representing an amino acid which interacts with its nearest neighbours through a contact energy as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for details about the model see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in the case of monomeric sequences , the canonical ensemble associated with the space of sequences for a fixed native conformation has been proved useful @xcite in selecting proteins with given thermodynamical and kinetical properties , due to the fact that these properties are essentially determined by the native ( ground state ) energy . in this context , the energy of a sequence is controlled by an `` evolutionary '' temperature @xmath1 , in such a way that the probability of selecting a sequence with energy @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath1 is an intensive variable which plays the role of temperature and gives the degree of bias towards low  energy sequences . in the evolutionary context",
    ", @xmath1 has the meaning of selective pressure with respect to the protein ability to fold @xcite .",
    "in particular , for values of @xmath1 lower than the temperature @xmath4 the average energy of the selected sequences is lower than @xmath0 , which is the energy which separates sequences with a unique and stable native conformation and able to find it rapidly from random heteropolymers , which undergo a lengthy and nonunique compaction process @xcite .    in the case of homodimers , we want not only to distinguish good from bad folders , but also to select those displaying a two  state from those displaying a three  state folding mechanism .",
    "this is done by controlling separately the energy @xmath5 associated with the interaction of amino acids belonging to the same monomer and the energy @xmath6 associated with the interaction of amino acids belonging to different monomers .",
    "accordingly , we select sequences @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the bulk and the interface energy of the sequence on the chosen native conformation and @xmath11 is the normalization constant . the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are intensive variable which give the degree of evolutionary pressure on the bulk and on the interface .",
    "the non  equilibrium distribution @xmath14 of eq .",
    "( [ dis_dim ] ) is the stationary distribution which maximizes the shannon entropy of the system at given values of the average bulk and interface energies . in other words",
    ", we are interested in a distribution which does not depend on time and which forgets about all microscopic details of the system ( i.e. minimizing the information , that is maximizing the entropy ) , except for the two average energies over which we want to have control . of course , if the two average energies are set to different values , this is a non  equilibrium distribution , implying that each of the two parts of the system is in contact with its own thermal bath .",
    "anyway , it is possible to describe the system in a fashion which is formally similar to that of the equilibrium canonical ensemble .",
    "if we call @xmath15 a generic distribution of states of the system , we can define the average energy functional @xmath16=\\sum h_1 p$ ] and @xmath17=\\sum h_t p$ ] of the two parts of the system and the entropy functional @xmath18=-\\sum p\\log p$ ] , which indicates the information we have about the system .    among all possible distributions @xmath15 , we are interested in the stationary distribution @xmath19 which minimizes the information ( maximizing @xmath20 ) at fixed values of the average energy @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] , values which we call @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . in keeping also with the constrain @xmath23 ,",
    "one minimizes the functional @xmath24-\\alpha(e_1[p]-e_1^*)-\\beta(e_t[p]-e_t^*)-(\\log z+1)(\\sum p-1),\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the lagrange multipliers which fix the value of the average energies and of the normalization factor , respectively .",
    "setting the derivative of this functional to zero gives the seeked expression for the stationary probability , that is , @xmath28 where the evaluation of the lagrange multipliers gives @xmath29 , which has the form of a partition function , and @xmath30 in parallel with equilibrium thermodynamics , we call `` temperature '' the inverse of the two lagrange multipliers , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the simultaneous action of the two evolutionary temperatures induce , in the design of dimers , a selective bias towards sequences displaying a conspicuous low energy in the native conformation , in a similar way that a single evolutionary temperature does in the case of the design of single  domain monomeric proteins @xcite .",
    "lowering @xmath12 or @xmath13 increases the pressure set in the bulk or on the interface , respectively .    to implement this procedure",
    "we use a multicanonical technique @xcite in the space of sequences , for a fixed dimeric native conformation .",
    "first , we select a target conformation built of two identical parts ( in the present case each a 36mer ) having a face in contact , in such a way that the overall structure is symmetrical with respect to the interface , as e.g. in fig .",
    "1(a ) , choosing a realistic ratio among the different kinds of amino acids @xcite.we swap amino acids , thus keeping the `` wild  type '' concentration fixed , accepting or rejecting the swap with the help of a multicanonical algorithm . in this way one can select a set ( composed typically of @xmath33 elements ) of evolutionary uncorrelated sequences @xmath7 corresponding to a given pair of values @xmath12 and @xmath13 , thus all designed under similar evolutionary conditions",
    "the dynamical simulation of the folding process of sequences selected at different values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 produces the phase diagram displayed in fig .",
    "2 , testifying to the fact that the folding properties of a sequence depend on its ground state energy . one can identify four areas in the phase diagram , corresponding respectively to a two or to a three  state folding behaviour and to two different kinds of aggregations : specific ( i.e. depending on certain contacts ) or not ( i.e. a random collapse ) .",
    "sequences selected at very low . ]",
    "values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 fold according to a two  state mechanism , first dimerizing and then folding to their dimeric native state .",
    "sequences following this behaviour are indicated with solid squares in fig .",
    "rising @xmath13 produces sequences which fold according to a three - state mechanism , first folding to the monomeric native state and then dimerizing ( solid triangles ) . leaving fixed @xmath13 we find that the upper limit of @xmath12 still leading to designed sequences folding according to any of these two paradigms corresponds to that value for which the total energy @xmath34 ( @xmath35 in the units we are considering , @xmath36 ) .",
    "examples of sequences folding according to the two mechanisms are @xmath37 whose energies are @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 , respectively .    keeping @xmath13 low and increasing @xmath12 ( so as to meet the curve associated with @xmath0 ) leads to sequences which aggregate ( empty diamonds in fig .",
    "an example of such sequences being provided by @xmath42 with @xmath43 @xmath44    aggregation takes place because the interface becomes too reactive with respect to the bulk . for evolutionary temperatures outside the area defined by the ordinate ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath0 ( solid curve in fig .",
    "2 ) , the equilibrium state is , at any temperature , either a disordered clump made by the two chains , or a state where the two chains are separated and unfolded , depending on their concentration ( cf .",
    "section v ) .    the central role played by the relative contact energy associated with the bulk and with the interface",
    "can be assessed from fig .",
    "3 . due to the fact that typical homodimers display many more bulk than interface contacts ( e.g. in the case under discussion 80 and 12 respectively , cf . figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) , respectively ) , it is not very useful to compare the total values @xmath46 and @xmath6 , but rather the average values @xmath47",
    ", @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    fig .",
    "3 suggests that provided @xmath51 the system folds . as a three  state dimer if @xmath52 , and as a two  state dimer if @xmath53 .",
    "it is furthermore shown that two  state dimers are less stable than three  state dimers ( @xmath54 ) , which in turn are again less stable than the monomer ( @xmath55 ) which folds to the native conformation corresponding to one of the two identical halves which build the dimer ( cf .",
    "1(a ) ) .    since the folding properties of homodimeric sequences depend on their conformational ground state energy , it is interesting to study the energy landscape of the space of sequences for a given conformation , space which is responsible for the evolution of the corresponding dimer .",
    "for this purpose , we have calculated the entropy as a function of the bulk energy @xmath5 and of the interface energy @xmath6 in the space of sequences , making use of a multicanonical algorithm @xcite , keeping fixed the conformation of fig .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "4 . also displayed in this figure are the absolute minima for the bulk and for the interface contacts , respectively    as already seen from fig .",
    "3 , it is not possible to optimize the bulk and the interface at the same time .",
    "in fact , lowering @xmath56 is done at the expenses of @xmath57 and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , the results displayed in fig . 4 indicate that the condition of energy minimum for the bulk energy ( @xmath58 ) implies that the interface energy is quite far from its minimum ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "vice versa , the minimum of the interface energy is @xmath60 is associated with a bulk energy @xmath61 . in keeping with this result , it is seen that small changes of @xmath5 are correlated with large variations in @xmath6 , but not vice versa . in fact , a @xmath62 change in @xmath5 is correlated with a @xmath63 change in @xmath6 , much larger than the ratio between the number of bulk and interface contacts ( @xmath64 ) . in other words ,",
    "bulk contacts play a central role in the design of both 3step as well as 2step folding dimers , as testified by the fact that in both cases @xmath65 , a condition not required to be fulfilled by @xmath56 .",
    "the exclusion relation observed between a simultaneous low value of @xmath5 and of @xmath6 results in negative specific heats @xmath66 and @xmath67 at low values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , respectively , as testified by the decrease of the energy when increasing the temperature ( cf . figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) ) .",
    "the regions of the @xmath68plane corresponding to negative specific heats @xmath69 and @xmath70 are delimited by dashed curves in fig .",
    "state folding sequences lie across the line @xmath71 , meaning that a low value of @xmath13 is not enough to guarantee a two  state folding character , but also @xmath57 has to be low ( cf .",
    "3 ) note that @xmath71 implies that @xmath5 is a minimum as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , sequences which are in the low@xmath13 region but are in the negative@xmath69 region aggregate ( empty diamonds in fig .",
    "2 ) , since the associated values of @xmath5 are high ( cf . fig .",
    "3 , sequence @xmath72 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "three - state folders are quite insensitive to the value of @xmath6 and consequently can be found equally well on both sides of the line corresponding to @xmath73 ( i.e. also @xmath74 in fig . 3 and solid traingles in fig .",
    "another interesting feature of the space of dimeric sequences is that the bulk energy @xmath5 depends strongly on @xmath12 ( the specific heat @xmath75 ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) but weakly on @xmath13 , the derivative @xmath69 being approximately a constant around @xmath78 ( except , of course , in the low  tail of @xmath13 where @xmath69 is negative ) .",
    "this can also be seen in fig . 3 from the fact that a @xmath63 change in @xmath56 ( in going from sequence @xmath79 to sequence @xmath80 ) is related to a modest change in @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , the interface energy @xmath6 , athough depending strongly only on @xmath13 , is more sensitive to both evolutionary temperatures , as it is clear from the fact that @xmath81 ranges from @xmath76 to @xmath82 , while @xmath70 ranges from @xmath83 to @xmath76 ( except in the low tail of @xmath12 ) .    summing up , bulk contacts play the leading role in determining the thermodynamical properties of the designed sequence .",
    "this is not only because there are more bulk ( 40 ) than interface ( 12 ) contacts .",
    "in fact , the specific heat _ per contact _ is @xmath84 for the bulk and @xmath85 for the interface .",
    "consequently , each interface contact is more sensitive to the evolutive pressure ( i.e. the evolutive temperature ) excerted on it than a bulk contact , not because they are less but because of their different topology ( see next section ) .",
    "moreover , a relation similar to the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem holds @xmath86 which links the energy fluctuations ( l.h .",
    "side ) to the specific heat ( r.h .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the distribution probability ( [ dis_dim ] ) is separable in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , for values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 similar and in keeping that @xmath87 , one can conclude that each interface contact fluctuates more than a bulk contact .",
    "the two main properties the space of sequences of dimeric proteins display are : a ) it is not possible to optimize both the bulk and the interface contacts at the same time and b ) the thermodynamical quantities characterizing the designed sequences are more sensitive to the evolutionary pressure associated with @xmath12 ( bulk ) than to that associated with @xmath13 ( interface ) .",
    "property a ) is typical of all systems with disordered interactions .",
    "like in spin glasses , the disorder of the matrix elements makes it impossible to optimize all parts of the system at the same time ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this also happens in the case of monomeric , single ",
    "domain proteins , although one does not , as a rule , discriminate between the different contacts , imposing the same selective pressure ( i.e. evolutionary temperature ) on all the residues .",
    "the asymmetry between the behaviour of the bulk and of the interface is due not only to the fact that there are more bulk than interface contacts , but also because the topology of such contacts is very different .",
    "in fact , the bulk is a three  dimensional system , composed of a rich network of interconnections ( cf .",
    "1(b ) ) , so that a residue can be correlated with other residues leading to long range order . on the other hand ,",
    "the interface is composed of contacts which are essentially independent of each other , although they are not independent of the bulk contacts .",
    "( cf . fig .",
    "this implies that , in principle , it is easier for an interface contact to be at a low energy than for a bulk contact , in keeping with the fact that it is easier to optimize an uncorrelated system than a correlated one .",
    "but it also means that the interface is less stable then the bulk , the associated native contact energies displaying much stronger variations than that associated with bulk contacts .",
    "the basic difference existing between bulk and interface contacts can be further clarified by comparing the thermodynamics of a typical lattice model protein ( in this case a 36-mer ) and a system composed of the same number of contacts , but placed , in the lattice , independently of each other @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 is displayed the average energy for the protein contacts and for the independent contact system ( solid and dashed curves , respectively ) .",
    "the average energy , sum of uncorrelated contributions , can reach an average value which is , at any design temperature ( evolutionary pressure ) , lower than the energy of the bulk .",
    "the shape of the energy function is well described by the predictions of the random energy model @xcite , i.e. @xmath88 ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the specific heat of the independent  contact  system ( i.e. the slope of the dashed curve ) is always larger than that of the bulk , indicating that the fluctuations in the independent  bond  system which , through the fluctuation  dissipation theorem , are proportional to the specific heat , are larger than in the bulk .",
    "in other words , independent contacts can reach lower energies but are more unstable than correlated contacts .",
    "the different thermodynamics associated with the interface and with bulk contacts is also reflected by the different conservation patterns for the amino acids lying on the interface and in the bulk .",
    "because three  state dimers concentrate their energy in the highly interconnected bulk , they display a conservation pattern typical of monomeric proteins in which few sites are higly conserved while the remaining sites can mutate more freely @xcite .",
    "if one calulates for each site its sequence entropy @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the probability to find the amino acid of kind @xmath91 in the @xmath92th site , then the resulting distibution of @xmath93 displays a low  s tail ( cf .",
    "7(b ) ) .    on the contrary , in the case of two  state dimers ,",
    "the energy is concentrated on the interface .",
    "since the interface contacts are independent on each other , none of them is privileged , so that the degree of conservation is more uniformly distribuited among a large number of amino acids than before .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath93 is that shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) and displays a sharper behaviour than that associated with three  state dimers .",
    "these results are in overall agreement with the findings by grishin and phillips , who analyze the conservation of residues on the surface of five two  state dimeric enzymes and find no signal of any larger conservation on the interface than in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the different topologies also imply that while the stabilization energy of three  state dimers is concentrated in few sites buried in the bulk and a mutation of one of these `` hot '' sites causes misfolding of the protein @xcite , in two  state dimers the energy is distributed more evenly on the interface , so that its sites are more tollerant to mutations .",
    "this allows two  state dimers to build active sites on the interface , for which purpose the protein has to mutate stabilizing residues with residues which perform other biological tasks .",
    "the folding mechanism of three  state homodimers is , within the lattice model , essentially the same as that of monomeric proteins , with the additional association step .",
    "first , les are stabilized by strongly interacting residues which are close along the chain ( the conserved residues discussed above ) . when the les assemble together to form the folding nucleus , the protein folds to its monomeric native state @xcite .",
    "the time limiting step is the association of the two monomers into the dimers , which is controlled both by the diffusion constant and by the stability of the interface .",
    "the behaviour of two  state dimers is different .",
    "first the interface is built , which is the time limiting step , and then the rest of the protein folds around the interface .",
    "this is again a nucleation event , which causes a sudden transition from the unfolded state to the dimeric native conformation , but involves a larger number of residues than in the case of three  state dimers .",
    "this mechanism is compatible with the finding that two  state dimers , like arc repressor @xcite , display small @xmath94values ( which is defined as the relative change in free energy between the native conformation and the transition state ensemble upon mutation @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , since the transition state is determined by the association of the dimers and the residues at the interface share evenly their stabilization energy , the free energy difference between native and transition state is also distributed among a large number of residues . in other words , none of the interface residues has a leading role in the formation of the interface",
    ".    sequences for which the strong evolutionary pressure on the interface is not balanced by a strong pressure on the bulk display specific aggregation .",
    "the term specific means that , although unstructured , the aggregate display some recursive interactions , typically between residues belonging to the interface .",
    "for example , in the case of sequence s@xmath95 listed above , that between residue 3 of one monomer and 6 of the other monomer . in the design of this sequence",
    "the low value of @xmath13 ( strong evolutionary pressure ) selects for the interface a subset of the 20 kinds of amino acids with quite low average contact energy ( their average value being @xmath96 , as compared to a zero value for the mj contact energies , with standard deviation @xmath97 , to be compared with @xmath98 for the mj contact energies ( cf .",
    "in fact , assuming it to be valid for both the interface and the bulk , one would obtain ( making use of @xmath99 , which for @xmath100 and @xmath101 gives @xmath102 ) @xmath103 . ] ) .",
    "a concentration of such strongly interacting residues makes it easy the assembly of the interface in a number of ways which are different from that of the native conformation , in a similar way as if a monomeric protein were composed only of strongly interacting residues , it would display a miriad of low energy conformations competing with the native one . to be more precise",
    ", the native interface ( @xmath104 ) has to compete with other conformations that the first twelve residues of each chain can assume , conformations which have energies of the order of @xmath105 ( again evaluated in the approximation of the random energy model @xcite ) , thus energetically more favourable than the native interface .",
    "conversely , the bulk is not so well optimized ( @xmath106 ) as to re  establish the energetic balance in favour of the native state .",
    "the outcome is a globule containing the first , strongly interacting , twelve residues of each chain , surrounded by a disordered cloud made of the other monomers .",
    "this kind of aggregation is different from the aggregation of poorly designed sequences . in this case",
    ", the energy of the native state is quite high and more homogeneously distributed among the contacts , and the resulting equilibrium conformation is an ill defined clump stabilized by random interactions .",
    "all the results described above have been found keeping fixed the size ( @xmath107 ) of the cell which contains the system .",
    "the dependence of the behaviour of the system on this size , which reflects the concentration of monomers , is described in the appendix .",
    "it has been shown that the bulk and the interface contacts contribute differently to the folding mechanism of dimers , due to their different topology .",
    "that is , the bulk displays a rich network of contacts , while pairs of residues belonging to different monomers interact independently of each other .",
    "this difference manifests itself in the different conservation patterns expected in the case of two  state and three  state dimers , conservation patterns which are the main point of contact between model predictions and real proteins .",
    "the folding behaviour dependens not only on the energetics of the sequence , but also on the monomer concentration @xmath108 , a quantity which is reflected , within the present model , by the linear dimension @xmath109 of the wigner cell where the calculations are carried out through the expression @xmath110 .    for @xmath111 the chains experience excluded volume violations .",
    "we found that even at @xmath112 the chains get entangled at any temperature , never finding the native conformation .",
    "this is due both to dynamical reasons , because of the lack of space available to the movements , and thermodynamical ones , since each lateral sites of the native conformation interact with those of a ( virtual ) neighbouring dimer , interaction which was not optimized in the design process and , consequently , rises the total energy of the system above @xmath0 .    for large @xmath109",

    "the free energy @xmath116 of the dimeric native state is equal to its internal energy @xmath117 ( the state is unique , so its entropy is zero ) .",
    "the free energy of the state @xmath115 is @xmath118 .",

    "moreover , even if one choses a low concentration ( large @xmath109 ) such that the dimeric native state becomes unstable , each monomeric native state ( @xmath132 state ) has an energy larger than the case of sequences of kind @xmath113 , i.e. of the order of few@xmath130 , so that it is quite unstable , having to compete with the sea of monomeric unfolded conformations .    in the calculations of the phase diagram of fig .",
    "2 , we have chosen @xmath107 , a choice which assures stability of all sequences selected and , as discussed above , allows the movement of the chains . even if with this choice , the system experiences some difficulties in reaching the native conformation , due to the narrowness of the space available .",

    "in fact , in 4 cases it finds a conformation with energy @xmath133 , corresponding to a situation in which one of the two chains ( let us call them a and b ) is folded ( say , chain a ) , the monomers of chain b at the interface being in their native position , while chain b is in a ( well defined ) conformation which has only @xmath134 similarity with its native structure ( similarity parameter @xmath135 ) .",
    "the reason for this result is to be found in the fact that chain b builds some contacts with the `` back '' of chain a , taking advantage of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these contacts are mostly between residues of chain b and partners which are of the right kind but belong to the wrong chain ( contacts 17a32b , 23a18b , 24a17b , 25a36b , 26a35b , 35a26b ) , while two of them are between monomers which can not be in contact if they belong to the same chain ( 31a32b , 32a33b ) .",
    "such conformation is a metastable state which , even slowing down the folding process , does not interfere seriously with the thermodynamics of this two  chain model .",
    "the situation is different if one consider a more realistic system built of a number of proteins comparable to the avogrado s number . in this case , the system can build a chain of dimers which gain an additional energy hrough this back  binding . this could give rise to regular structures resembling amyloid fibrils .",
