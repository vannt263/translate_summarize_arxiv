    "the structure and interactions of the light nuclei have been the focus of experimental and theoretical explorations since the infancy of nuclear physics . yet",
    "more than one hundred years later , and despite having made remarkable progress in describing these systems in terms of nuclear forces that are well - constrained by experiment , we remain unable to predict the binding and interactions of any given nucleus with reliable estimates of the associated uncertainties .",
    "it has long been accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the electroweak interactions produce the nuclear forces , and consequently are responsible for the structure and interactions of all nuclei .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of the qcd vacuum has so far prevented the calculation of low - energy and medium - energy nuclear systems directly from qcd . beyond recovering the results of decades of experimental investigation , it is crucial to establish and verify tools with which to perform such calculations , with quantifiable uncertainties , in order to determine the properties and structure of exotic nuclei , and of matter in extreme environments or in kinematic regimes where experiments are not possible or practical .    the only known way with which to calculate the low - energy properties of hadronic and nuclear systems rigorously is lattice qcd ( lqcd ) . in lqcd calculations ,",
    "the quark and gluon fields are defined on a discretized space - time of finite volume , and the path integral over the fields is evaluated numerically .",
    "while lqcd calculations deviate from those of qcd due to the finite distance between points of the grid ( lattice spacing ) and the finite volume of the grid ( lattice volume ) , such deviations can be systematically removed by reducing the lattice spacing , increasing the lattice volume and extrapolating to the continuum and infinite - volume limits using the known dependences determined with effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "calculation of important quantities in nuclear physics using lqcd is only now becoming practical , with first calculations of simple multibaryon interactions being recently performed , although not at the physical values of the light - quark masses .",
    "early exploratory quenched calculations of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering lengths  @xcite performed more than a decade ago have been superseded by @xmath6 calculations within the last few years  @xcite ( and added to by further quenched calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "further , the first quenched calculations of the deuteron  @xcite , @xmath7he and @xmath8he  @xcite have been performed , along with @xmath6 calculations of @xmath7he and multibaryon systems containing strange quarks  @xcite . in addition , efforts to explore nuclei and nuclear matter using the strong coupling limit of qcd have led to some interesting observations  @xcite . recently , @xmath6 calculations  @xcite and @xmath2 calculations  @xcite have provided evidence that the h - dibaryon ( with the quantum numbers of @xmath9 ) is bound at a pion mass of @xmath10 at the physical value of the strange - quark mass  @xcite and over a range of su(3)-degenerate light - quark masses with @xmath11 to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "extrapolations to the physical light - quark masses suggest that a weakly bound h - dibaryon or a near - threshold resonance exists in this channel  @xcite .",
    "we have searched for bound states in other channels at @xmath13  @xcite , and evidence has been found for a bound state in the strangeness-4 @xmath14 system . this is consistent with model - dependent and eft predictions of a bound state at the physical pion mass  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the identification of bound states , calculations of hyperon - nucleon scattering extrapolated to the physical pion mass ( using leading - order ( lo ) eft ) have been performed and directly compared with the results of phase - shift analyses of experimental data  @xcite .    in this work we focus on the lightest nuclei and hypernuclei and present results of the first lqcd calculations of a number of s - shell nuclei and hypernuclei with @xmath15 , including , , , , and a five - body state   in the limit of exact su(3)-flavor symmetry ( and consequently , exact isospin symmetry ) .",
    "hypernuclear spectroscopy is enjoying an experimental renaissance with ongoing and planned programs at da@xmath16ne , fair , jefferson lab , j - parc and mainz providing motivation for enhanced theoretical efforts ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "our lqcd calculations are performed using an isotropic clover quark action at the su(3)-flavor symmetric point corresponding to the physical strange - quark mass , with @xmath17 .",
    "three lattice volumes have been employed with spatial extent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and calculations of systems with non - zero total momentum ( boosted systems ) have been performed to investigate the volume dependence of binding energies  @xcite .",
    "only one relatively coarse lattice spacing , @xmath18 has been used in the calculations , dictated by the available computational resources , and therefore , an extrapolation to the continuum has not been performed .",
    "further , extrapolations to the physical light - quarks masses have not been attempted because the quark - mass dependences of the energy levels in the light nuclei are not known .",
    "future calculations at smaller lattice spacings and at lighter quark masses will facilitate such extrapolations and lead to first predictions for the spectrum of light nuclei with completely quantified uncertainties that can be compared with experiment .",
    "three ensembles of isotropic gauge - field configurations , generated with a tadpole - improved lscher - weisz gauge action and a clover fermion action  @xcite , are used in this work .",
    "this particular lattice - action setup follows closely the anisotropic clover action of the ensembles generated by the jlab group that we have used in our previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "the parameter tuning and scaling properties of this action will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "one level of stout smearing  @xcite with @xmath19 and tadpole - improved tree - level clover coefficient @xmath20 are used in the gauge - field generation .",
    "studies  @xcite of the pcac relation in the schrdinger functional indicate that this choice is consistent with vanishing @xmath21 violations , leading to discretization effects that are essentially @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters of the ensembles are listed in table  [ tab : gauageparams ] , and further details will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . as multibaryon systems are the focus of this work ,",
    "relatively large lattice volumes are employed for the calculations , with correspondingly large values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    ".parameters of the ensembles of gauge - field configurations and of the measurements used in this work .",
    "the lattices have dimension @xmath25 , a lattice spacing @xmath26 , and a bare quark mass @xmath27 ( in lattice units ) generating a pion of mass @xmath28 . @xmath29",
    "light - quark sources are used ( as described in the text ) to perform measurements on @xmath30 configurations in each ensemble . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.0 cm",
    "given the single - hadron and two - body energies that have been extracted in secs .",
    "[ sec : b ] and [ sec : bb ] , the continuum states that are expected to arise in the three - body sectors with given quantum numbers can be estimated .",
    "similarly , the information obtained for the three - body systems extracted in sec .  [ sec : bbb ] allows for an estimate of the continuum states in the four - body sector , and so forth in higher - body systems . in the figures in the main text ,",
    "this information has been presented as the infinite - volume thresholds for the various possible continuum channels . here , we present an example of the expected spectrum of states in the  system in the different lattice volumes used in this work .    for a non - interacting two - component system , comprised of nuclei @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the individual components have only back - to - back momenta , @xmath33 for three or more cluster continuum states ( for example @xmath34 in the  channel ) , labeling the clusters @xmath31 , @xmath35 , the system has energies permitted by momentum conservation @xmath36 with the obvious generalization to systems with a nonzero center - of - mass momentum .",
    "these considerations ignore the interactions between the clusters , which will modify the position of the corresponding energy levels . for two - body clusters ,",
    "it is expected that there will be @xmath37 shifts in the continuum energies , but for higher - body clusters the form of the energy shifts is not known . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ap2:1 ] we present the expected ( ignoring interactions ) fv energy levels in the   sector for each of the volumes used in this work .",
    "the blue , green and red lines in each column denote the location of non - interacting continuum levels in the , and ensembles , respectively .",
    "the location of the states in the and ensembles have been displaced slightly for demonstrative purposes .",
    ", scaledwidth=99.0% ]    with more accurate lqcd calculations and additional interpolating operators , we aim to investigate these states in the future .",
    "however , this makes clear the difficulty in extracting excited states in nuclei from this type of calculation .",
    "the continuum states rapidly accumulate as the lattice volume becomes large , and isolating nuclear excited states above the lowest - lying continuum states will be challenging with current technology and algorithms .",
