    "black holes are now generally regarded as astrophysical realities , which are expected to be major sources of gravitational radiation , prompting extensive studies of dynamical , strong - field processes such as binary mergers .",
    "the textbook theory of black holes , however , mostly concerns stationary black holes or physically unlocatable event horizons @xcite .",
    "in recent years , a new paradigm for dynamical black holes has been developed in terms of trapping horizons , generated from surfaces where light is momentarily caught by the gravitational field .",
    "they locate the black hole in a practical , local way .",
    "the original idea due to penrose @xcite is that of a trapped surface , which compose the interior of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "such surfaces played a key role in the singularity theorems of penrose and hawking @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the black hole is composed of marginally trapped surfaces , here called marginal surfaces .",
    "they are also commonly called apparent horizons , though the textbook definition of the latter differs @xcite . by itself , this does not capture the idea of a black hole , as such surfaces also exist in cosmological models . presumably for this reason ,",
    "such quasi - local ideas were not much developed at the time .",
    "instead history took a different turn , with the introduction of global methods and the near - universal acceptance of an event horizon as the definition of black hole .",
    "the author s interest in this area began with a rather simple observation : that it is outgoing ( rather than ingoing ) wavefronts which are marginally trapped , that ingoing wavefronts are converging , and that the trapped surfaces are inside ( rather than outside ) .",
    "this led to a definition of a black hole by a future ( rather than past ) outer ( rather than inner ) trapping horizon @xcite . here trapping horizon is used to mean any hypersurface foliated by marginal surfaces , a change from the original definition .",
    "remarkably , this refinement sufficed to derive some key expected properties of black holes , assuming positive - energy conditions : the marginal surfaces have spherical topology ; the horizon is spatial or null , and null only when a certain energy density vanishes , so that the horizon is one - way traversable ; and the area @xmath0 is constant when null and increasing when spatial . physically ,",
    "if something falls into a black hole , the horizon moves out and the area increases .    in the case of spherical symmetry ,",
    "a rather complete picture emerged @xcite .",
    "there is a standard definition @xcite of active gravitational mass @xmath1 .",
    "it satisfies an energy conservation law akin to the first law of thermodynamics , with energy - supply and work terms , reducing to the bondi energy equation at null infinity .",
    "there is also a natural definition @xcite of surface gravity @xmath2 , taking a quasi - newtonian form , just @xmath3 in vacuo , in units @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "it has various desirable properties , including that @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 on outer , degenerate or inner trapping horizons respectively .",
    "then projecting the energy conservation law along a trapping horizon , denoted by a prime , yields @xmath9 plus work term , where @xmath10 denotes evaluation on a trapping horizon .",
    "this is a dynamic version of the so - called first law of black - hole mechanics @xcite .",
    "versions of these definitions and results also exist in cylindrical symmetry @xcite , which is the simplest situation allowing gravitational radiation , in plane symmetry @xcite and in a quasi - spherical approximation @xcite , which allows the interaction of roughly spherical black holes with gravitational radiation . in all these cases",
    ", there is an effective energy tensor @xmath11 for the gravitational radiation , entering the energy conservation law additively with the matter energy tensor @xmath12 .",
    "meanwhile , ashtekar and others developed a theory of isolated horizons @xcite , which are null trapping horizons with a hierarchy of additional conditions , each intended to describe a black hole in local equilibrium to some degree , generalizing killing horizons .",
    "in particular , they defined angular momentum @xmath13 , entering a first law in the expected way .",
    "a breakthrough came with the work of ashtekar & krishnan @xcite on what they called dynamical horizons , which are spatial future trapping horizons .",
    "they derived flux laws for both energy and angular momentum . in the versions subsequently developed by the author @xcite",
    ", they hold for any trapping horizon and take the form of conservation laws @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a marginal surface , @xmath16 its area form , @xmath17 is the lie derivative , @xmath18 is a generating vector of the trapping horizon , @xmath19 its normal dual @xcite , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are certain vectors which play the role normally played by killing vectors . here",
    "@xmath11 is again interpreted as an effective energy tensor for gravitational radiation .",
    "apart from the inclusion of @xmath11 , these have the same form as corresponding flat - space conservation laws in surface - integral form",
    ".    some subtleties remained .",
    "firstly , in what one might call the bottom - up approach of ashtekar and co - authors , the formalisms for isolated and dynamical horizons were quite different , and it was not clear how to relate them .",
    "some progress was made by booth & fairhurst for slowly evolving horizons @xcite .",
    "conversely , in the author s top - down approach , whereby local equilibrium is given simply by the trapping horizon being null , there is a degeneracy in taking the null limit . remarkably , consideration of angular momentum closed this gap by suggesting a natural way to fix the degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the resulting gauge - fixed null trapping horizon is then equivalent , modulo further gauge - fixing , to a weakly isolated horizon @xcite .",
    "thus the top - down and bottom - up approaches have converged on the same definition of a black hole in local equilibrium .    for this reason , combined with the existence of the reviews of ashtekar & krishnan @xcite , booth @xcite , krishnan @xcite and gourgoulhon & jaramillo @xcite ,",
    "this review will concentrate on the paradigm in terms of trapping horizons , without attempting to make detailed comparisons with the other approaches .",
    "indeed , it is intended to be largely complementary to those reviews , apart from inevitable overlap on core issues .",
    "no attempt will be made at a comprehensive list of references , since the area and related areas are rapidly evolving . with a broad audience in mind ,",
    "detailed calculations and proofs will be deferred to references .",
    "general relativity , including the einstein equation , will be assumed throughout , though the essential ideas can be generalized to other metric theories or dimensions .",
    "what one might nowadays call newtonian black holes were described long ago by mitchell and laplace @xcite , as objects for which the escape speed @xmath22 is greater than the speed @xmath23 of light .",
    "any light leaving such an object would be trapped by the gravitational field and fall back , rendering it invisible .",
    "curiously , the newtonian relation @xmath24 will survive quite generally in a sense to be revealed , with units @xmath25 henceforth .",
    "almost immediately after einstein formulated general relativity @xcite in 1915 , schwarzschild @xcite derived the solution for the gravitational field of a point mass @xmath1 .",
    "charge @xmath26 was soon added by reissner @xcite and nordstrm @xcite .",
    "however , the geometry of the solutions was not understood for decades .",
    "einstein & rosen @xcite deciphered the ( @xmath27 ) spatial geometry in 1935 , with a wormhole connecting two asymptotically flat spaces , but it was not until around 1960 that the maximally extended space - time geometry was understood , with work of wheeler , kruskal @xcite and fronsdal @xcite .",
    "the space - time diagram clearly shows a region @xmath28 from which light can not escape .",
    "it had already been shown by oppenheimer & snyder @xcite in 1939 that gravitational collapse could indeed produce such a region . according to relativistic causality , nothing else",
    "can escape either .",
    "angular momentum @xmath13 was added by kerr @xcite and ( for @xmath29 ) newman et al .",
    "@xcite and finally around 1968 , the term `` black hole '' entered the lexicon , attributed to wheeler @xcite .",
    "a few years of rapid progress followed , culminating in the classical paradigm .",
    "black holes were defined in general by event horizons as defined by penrose @xcite , which satisfy the area - increase theorem of hawking @xcite , @xmath30 .",
    "this became known as a second law , part of the four laws of black - hole mechanics formulated by bardeen , carter & hawking @xcite , which seemed analogous to the four laws of thermodynamics .",
    "the zeroth law is that surface gravity @xmath2 is constant on stationary black holes .",
    "the first law is @xmath31 for perturbations of stationary black holes , where @xmath32 is the adm energy at spatial infinity , @xmath33 is the angular speed and @xmath34 is the electric potential .",
    "the third law is @xmath35 , by perturbations of stationary black holes .",
    "the discovery of quantum black - hole radiance by hawking @xcite , with temperature @xmath36 in units @xmath37 , led to much research on black holes as a key area to generate and test ideas concerning the interface of gravity , quantum theory and thermodynamics .        once a theoretical curiosity , observational evidence for black holes has by now accumulated past the point where they are part of mainstream astrophysics , both as stellar - mass black holes produced as supernova remnants , and as supermassive black holes mysteriously found at the cores of most galaxies , powering active galactic nuclei .",
    "gravitational - wave detectors are expected to be able to observe such processes as binary inspiral and merger of black holes or neutron stars , prompting much research in numerically computing waveforms .    in such dynamical situations ,",
    "the classical paradigm is of little help .",
    "firstly , event horizons are defined as the boundary between where light can or can not escape to infinity , which means not only infinite distance but infinitely far in the future . therefore one can not locate it without knowing future events , indeed the entire future history of the universe , which is beyond mere mortals .",
    "it is easy to give examples @xcite where an event horizon exists in a region of flat space - time ( fig .",
    "[ event ] ) .",
    "then an observer crossing the event horizon can not detect it in any way and has never experienced a gravitational field .    in practice , it is normally much easier to locate marginal surfaces in numerical simulations .",
    "note also that three of the above laws are more accurately described as black - hole statics , since they concern stationary black holes , specifically killing horizons .",
    "so the question arises : are there corresponding laws of black - hole dynamics ?",
    "the basic idea is easily explained .",
    "imagine enclosing a star with a roughly spherical spatial surface at some moment of time , and detonating a flash of light simultaneously at each point of the surface .",
    "two wavefronts form , one ingoing and one outgoing .",
    "normally one expects the outgoing wavefront to have increasing area and the ingoing wavefront to have decreasing area .",
    "this is measured at each point by the expansions @xmath38 of light rays in the wavefronts : @xmath39 for the outgoing wavefront and @xmath40 for the ingoing wavefront .",
    "however , the gravitational field of the star tends to drag things toward it , including light .",
    "thus the outgoing wavefront does not expand as much as if the star were not present . the effect increases closer to the star and for larger mass , as well known from newton s law of gravitation .",
    "for large enough mass , for a surface close enough , it may happen that the outgoing wavefront has decreasing area .",
    "this is a black hole : all light and therefore matter are confined inside a shrinking area .",
    "the idea then is that the boundary of the black hole at a given time is a marginal surface , meaning that one wavefront has instantaneously parallel light rays , in this case @xmath41 . to characterize a black hole ,",
    "it is also important that the ingoing wavefront is converging , @xmath40 , and that @xmath42 is decreasing in the ingoing direction .",
    "this is formulated geometrically as follows .",
    "a spatial surface @xmath15 in space - time has two unique future - pointing null normal directions , along null normal vectors @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the space - time metric and @xmath46 denotes projection onto @xmath15 .",
    "the null expansions are @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath15 is said to be _ trapped _ if @xmath49 , _ marginal _ if @xmath41 or @xmath50 , and _ untrapped _ ( or mean convex ) if @xmath51 . in terms of the expansion vector or mean - curvature vector @xmath52",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath53 being temporal , null or spatial , respectively .",
    "one finds @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a normalization function , @xmath56 for any normal vector @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the expansion @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 .",
    "untrapped surfaces have a local spatial orientation : an _ achronal _ ( meaning spatial or null ) normal vector @xmath57 is _ outward _ or _ inward _ if @xmath61 or @xmath62 respectively .",
    "locally one can conventionally fix @xmath39 , @xmath40 in an untrapped region ; then @xmath63 is outward and @xmath64 is inward .",
    "conversely , trapped surfaces have a local causal orientation : if @xmath53 is future or past _ causal _ ( meaning temporal or null ) , the surface is _ future _ or _",
    "past _ trapped respectively",
    ". then future or past trapped surfaces have @xmath65 or @xmath66 respectively .",
    "marginal surfaces have both orientations , if the other null expansion has fixed non - zero sign .",
    "a _ trapping horizon _ is a hypersurface foliated by marginal surfaces .",
    "it is said to be _",
    "outer _ or _ inner _ if @xmath67 or @xmath68 respectively , for the case @xmath41 , where the null normals @xmath43 are extended off the horizon to generate ingoing and outgoing wavefronts from the marginal surfaces , i.e.  two families of null hypersurfaces labelled by @xmath69 , intersecting in the marginal surfaces , such that @xmath70 .",
    "this is locally unique unless the trapping horizon is itself null .",
    "equivalently , the horizon is outer or inner if @xmath71 or @xmath72 respectively , where @xmath73 is the normal dual vector @xcite to a normal vector @xmath74 : @xmath75 this is a vector version of the normal hodge dual for 1-forms .",
    "then a future ( respectively past ) outer trapping horizon provides a local definition of a generic black ( respectively white ) hole @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the idea is that a non - degenerate black hole exists only if such a horizon exists . as to the converse , see the concluding remarks .",
    "note that outer versus inner has been defined with respect to the ingoing null direction , as this is invariant , rather than in some ingoing spatial direction . also , demanding a strict sign for @xmath76 has excluded extremal black holes , for which @xmath76 vanishes .",
    "this is for simplicity only , as they can be treated as special cases .",
    "relaxing the definition to @xmath77 would allow cases which are not black holes .",
    "summarized here are some basic properties of trapping horizons @xcite . where not obvious , the proofs involve either ( for @xmath41 ) the @xmath78 component of the einstein equation , where the null energy condition ( nec ) is cited , or the @xmath79 component , where the dominant energy condition ( dec ) is cited .",
    "one introduces a normal generating vector @xmath18 of the marginal surfaces in the horizon , which therefore satisfies @xmath80 on the horizon .",
    "the area of the marginal surfaces , if compact , is @xmath81    _ trapping _ :",
    "for a future / past , outer / inner trapping horizon , there are trapped surfaces to one side and untrapped surfaces to the other side . for a future outer trapping horizon , this reflects the defining idea that outgoing light rays are momentarily parallel , @xmath41 , diverging just outside , @xmath39 , and converging just inside , @xmath82 , while ingoing light rays are converging , @xmath40 .    _",
    "signature _ : assuming nec , an outer or inner trapping horizon is achronal or causal respectively , and null if and only if the effective ingoing energy density @xmath83 vanishes , where the explicit expressions for @xmath11 are given later ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "in particular , this means that _ black - hole horizons are one - way traversable _ : one can fall into a black hole but not escape , at least through the outer horizon .",
    "_ area _ : assuming nec , future outer or past inner trapping horizons have non - decreasing area form , @xmath84 , and therefore ( if compact ) non - decreasing area , @xmath85 , instantaneously constant ( @xmath86 ) if and only if the horizon is null . for past outer or future inner trapping horizons , all signs reverse . here",
    "the orientation of @xmath18 is such that , in the null limit , it is future - null , which means that it is future causal for inner horizons and outward achronal for outer horizons . in particular",
    ", this means that _ black holes grow _ if they absorb any matter or gravitational radiation , and otherwise remain the same size .",
    "_ topology _ : assuming dec , a future / past outer trapping horizon has marginal surfaces of spherical topology ( if compact ) .",
    "the proof uses the gauss - bonnet and gauss divergence theorems .",
    "thus _ realistic black holes are topologically spherical_. if degenerate horizons are considered , then toroidal topology is just allowed , but highly non - generic , in particular gaussian flat , and so presumably unstable .",
    "_ area limit _ : assuming dec and a positive cosmological constant @xmath87 , outer trapping horizons satisfy@xcite @xmath88",
    ". thus black holes are smaller than the cosmological horizon scale , corresponding to an area @xmath89 .",
    "pedagogically , this would be the place to give details in spherical symmetry @xcite , cylindrical symmetry @xcite , plane symmetry @xcite and the quasi - spherical approximation @xcite , but they are omitted here due to limitations of space , apart from as explained in the introduction .",
    "the simplest generalization of the schwarzschild relation @xmath90 to a general surface is the hawking mass @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the area radius .",
    "it has various useful properties .",
    "large spheres : in an asymptotically flat space - time , @xmath1 tends to the bondi or adm energy at null or spatial infinity , respectively .",
    "small spheres : @xmath93 density at a regular centre . trapping :",
    "a surface is trapped , marginal or untrapped if @xmath28 , @xmath94 or @xmath95 respectively .",
    "in particular , this means that @xmath1 is the _ irreducible mass _ of a future outer trapping horizon , @xmath96 , assuming nec .",
    "this follows directly from the area law , since @xmath97 , where @xmath10 henceforth denotes evaluation on a marginal surface .",
    "recall the irreducible mass for stationary black holes @xcite : @xmath98 for kerr black holes , the mass which remains even if rotational energy is removed by the penrose process .",
    "the original concept arose due to quasi - stationary arguments , but here it is exact and gives a physical meaning to @xmath1 .",

    "the central result here is that , assuming dec , @xmath203 on a null trapping horizon @xcite . therefore the conserved quantities are actually preserved : @xmath204 this indicates that _ local equilibrium is attained when a trapping horizon becomes null_.    it follows that @xmath205 in particular , the surface gravity , which already satisfies @xmath206 by definition ( [ sg ] ) , is constant where a trapping horizon becomes null .",
    "this is a quite general zeroth law .",
    "the above result is stronger still , since it expresses complete local equilibrium , not just thermal equilibrium .    by the area law @xcite , which includes @xmath207 null",
    ", this also shows that _ a black hole can not change its angular momentum or charge without increasing its area_.    on a null trapping horizon , one may take @xmath208 , but the other null vector @xmath64 is non - unique , leading to non - uniqueness in @xmath209 , used to define angular momentum here and for dynamical horizons by ashtekar & krishnan @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath157 is unique , an intrinsic normal fundamental form of a null hypersurface , therefore used to define angular momentum for isolated horizons by ashtekar et al .   @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the extrinsic normal fundamental form @xmath210 is preserved @xcite : dec @xmath211 .",
    "the non - uniqueness is therefore naturally fixed by @xmath212 recalling the definition ( [ f ] ) of the normalization function @xmath55 , this is a legitimate choice of gauge .",
    "then all three normal fundamental forms coincide .",
    "also @xmath213 , so that @xmath214 assuming only that @xmath21 is a coordinate vector . comparing with energy , nec @xmath215 automatically on a null trapping horizon",
    ".    thus consideration of angular momentum resolves the ambiguity in taking the null limit .",
    "the general formalism for trapping horizons then applies in all cases , describing transitions between growing and non - growing phases of a black hole .",
    "this has largely recovered the notion of weakly isolated horizon due to ashtekar et al .",
    "@xcite , except that the ( allowable ) scaling freedom in @xmath18 has not been fixed @xcite .",
    "while the above properties indicate that a future outer trapping horizon serves as a practical definition of black hole , it should be noted that a trapping horizon may change its type under evolution .",
    "for instance , in gravitational collapse , it is common for an inner horizon to form simultaneously with an outer horizon .",
    "in fact they join smoothly and are really two parts of a single horizon in a space - time sense , manifesting as distinct horizons in a spatial slicing ( fig.[evap ] ) . according to the basic laws ,",
    "the transition occurs when the horizon is null , with the outer horizon achronal and the inner horizon causal .",
    "booth et al .",
    "@xcite constructed examples where an outer horizon becomes past - null , turning into a past - causal inner horizon , which can then turn into an outer horizon again , and so on . also , numerical examples of schnetter et al .",
    "@xcite show that a trapping horizon can be partly outer and partly inner on a given marginal surface , interpolating between regions where it is strictly inner or strictly outer .",
    "one application of such ideas is to evaporating black holes .",
    "ingoing hawking radiation tends to have negative energy density , @xmath216 , violating nec , and if it dominates over gravitational radiation in the sense that @xmath217 , the basic laws reverse : the outer horizon becomes causal and shrinks , while the inner horizon becomes spatial and grows .",
    "thus it is possible that they simply reunite smoothly , closing off the region of trapped surfaces ( fig.[evap ] ) .",
    "the black hole has then evaporated .",
    "if no singularity ever formed , the space - time would have the global structure of minkowski space - time and there would be no possibility of information loss and the associated information puzzle .",
    "explicit examples of such space - times have been constructed @xcite .    .",
    "no attempt has been made to indicate relative motion.,height=302 ]    another application is to the coalescence of binary black holes , of great interest as generators of strong gravitational waves .",
    "typically a common outer horizon forms around the original two outer horizons . as above",
    ", it joins smoothly to an inner horizon , though the latter is not always tracked in simulations .",
    "it can be conjectured that the inner horizon later joins with the original outer horizons .",
    "for instance , the inner horizon may pinch off and change topology from one sphere to two spheres , which close in on the original outer horizons and merge smoothly with them , leaving the entire region inside the common outer horizon composed of trapped surfaces ( fig.[merger ] ) .",
    "this appears to be consistent with simulations @xcite , where the original outer horizons are slowly evolving and appear to be stable , while the inner horizon appears to be unstable and is rapidly evolving .",
    "more complex topologies are possible , and indeed there is numerical evidence that the original outer horizons can osculate and then intersect each other @xcite , allowing a self - intersecting inner horizon .",
    "it is also possible that singularities may intervene first , but this would be occurring in untrapped regions and so violate a version of strong cosmic censorship .",
    "according to the above picture , the entire set of horizons actually form a single trapping horizon in space - time , despite manifesting temporally as different and apparently unrelated horizons .",
    "the whole horizon can be smooth , though the spatial sections will have at least one point of non - smoothness where the topology changes .",
    "the irreducible mass @xmath1 , being given by the area @xmath0 , may be evaluated throughout the entire process , satisfying the energy conservation law .",
    "the separate areas @xmath218 and @xmath219 add to the common area @xmath0 at the topology change , @xmath220 , so that , assuming nec , @xmath221 at any stage where either exists , where one follows the original outer horizons outwards in a space - time sense until the trapping horizon becomes a common outer horizon .",
    "the inequality holds also during inner stages , where one should note that the inner horizon is past - causal in an outward sense , so the area is still increasing outwards .",
    "this is an area - increase law for coalescing black holes , reminiscent of hawking s famous theorem for event horizons @xcite .",
    "it also implies @xmath222 however , note that the total irreducible mass is actually reducible in such a process , indeed it necessarily decreases discontinuously at the change of topology , @xmath223 .",
    "the greatest fractional loss of total irreducible mass , @xmath224 , occurs in the equal - mass case and is @xmath225 , the same figure as obtained by the classical argument involving event horizons . in practice",
    ", the figure will be much less , since @xmath1 decreases only at the change of topology and is otherwise increasing outwards , particularly during the violent type - changing phase .    here",
    "one might prefer on physical grounds to use the effective energy @xmath32 instead of @xmath1 as a measure of available energy , which would require knowledge of angular momentum @xmath13 .",
    "one may also evaluate @xmath13 throughout the whole process , but here there is an issue of whether it goes smoothly through the topology change , due to the more indirect construction and the numerically observed spin - flip phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this is of some interest by itself , as a potential way to relate initial and final angular momenta , and could be studied either analytically or by pushing simulations inside the region which is normally excised .",
    "it seems appropriate to conclude with some important recent results and issues .",
    "firstly , there is the uniqueness of trapping horizons .",
    "ashtekar & galloway @xcite have shown that the structure of a given dynamical horizon is unique , in that there is only one way to foliate it by marginal surfaces .",
    "they also showed that such horizons are not so numerous as to foliate a space - time region , so that they will tend to interweave one another .",
    "andersson , mars & simon @xcite defined a strictly stable marginally outer trapped surface by a condition similar to the outer condition and showed that , given such a surface in one of a foliation of spatial hypersurfaces , such surfaces exist locally in the foliation .",
    "this shows that trapping horizons are not unique in a given space - time , indeed one is locally generated from a given marginal surface however the hypersurface is evolved . in practice , this is a useful quality since it means that a trapping horizon is likely to be found in numerical simulations , provided the foliation is chosen reasonably well .",
    "they also showed that , assuming nec , the horizon is , on any one marginal surface , either spatial everywhere or null everywhere .",
    "thus transitions between isolated and dynamical phases happen simultaneously with respect to the foliation .    andersson & metzger @xcite have shown that , given a spatial hypersurface with an outer trapped inner boundary and an outer untrapped outer boundary , there exists a stable marginally outer trapped surface between , which is smooth and unique as the outermost such surface .",
    "this strengthens an earlier result which assumed piecewise smoothness @xcite .",
    "since this is the situation expected in numerical simulations of black holes , it guarantees the existence of an outermost trapping horizon with respect to the foliation .",
    "another issue is that , in a spherically symmetric space - time such as vaidya , it is possible to find trapped or outer trapped surfaces which lie partly outside the spherically symmetric trapping horizon , as shown numerically by schnetter & krishnan @xcite and analytically by ben - dov @xcite .",
    "the surfaces are roughly spherical and inside the horizon except for a long tentacle which extends through it .",
    "these are rather strange - looking surfaces , so one interpretation is that , in order to locate a black hole in a physically acceptable way , the type of trapping horizon needs to be refined further . for instance",
    ", it seems reasonable to require marginal or trapped surfaces to have positive gaussian curvature , which would tend to exclude such tentacles . alternatively or additionally",
    ", one might require any surface sufficiently close to a marginal surface and inside it to be a ( non - strictly ) trapped surface .",
    "this review has not addressed quantum issues directly , for which one may consult the review of ashtekar & krishnan @xcite .",
    "one remarkable feature of the framework for isolated horizons is a derivation of black - hole entropy proportional to area @xmath0 .",
    "much less is known about dynamical situations .",
    "a very recent result is that , in spherical symmetry , a tunnelling method derives a local hawking temperature @xmath36 precisely for future outer trapping horizons @xcite .",
    "thus this framework for dynamical black holes seems to be well adapted to the issues raised by hawking radiation .",
