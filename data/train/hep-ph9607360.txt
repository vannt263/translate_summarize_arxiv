    "the importance of a direct determination of @xmath38 and @xmath39 is due to the ambiguities associated with measuring only @xmath9 .",
    "consider , for example , the light @xmath40 of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) .",
    "model parameter choices are easily found such that @xmath41 is much larger than predicted for the @xmath8 @xcite , but @xmath42 is only slightly larger than expected due to the fact that the numerator , @xmath43 , and denominator , @xmath44 , are both increased by similar amounts .",
    "extra ( supersymmetric particle ) decay modes could even enhance @xmath44 further , and @xmath42 could be smaller than the sm prediction despite the fact that @xmath41 is enhanced .",
    "equation  ( [ stepiv ] ) shows that the ability to detect deviations of @xmath38 and @xmath39 from sm expectations depends critically on the error in @xmath0 , which is very likely to be the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "of course , dramatic deviations of @xmath0 from sm expectations are also a possibility , even if the @xmath28 is very sm - like in its couplings to the sm particles .",
    "large effects can be caused by new particles ( fourth generation , supersymmetric , ) in the one - loop graphs responsible for the @xmath45 coupling .",
    "regardless of the size of the deviations from sm predictions , determining @xmath0 will be vital to understanding the nature of the higgs boson and will provide an important probe of , or limits on , new physics that may lie beyond the sm .",
    "we consider sm higgs masses in the range @xmath46 ; @xmath47 in units of @xmath29 is 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.4 , 1.8 , 2.2 , 2.6 , 2.6 , 2.2 , 1.6 as @xmath48 ranges from 70 to 150 gev in steps of 10 gev . in computing signals and backgrounds ,",

    "the @xmath53 cut also implies that for @xmath56 the signal is almost entirely from @xmath57 ( interference with the @xmath33-fusion diagram being small ) .",

    "( [ ways ] ) are small . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the error obtained using only the @xmath33-fusion channel measurement is significantly decreased by including the @xmath34 channel measurement . at @xmath76 ,",
    "the @xmath33-fusion channel can be neglected and the net error is essentially just that for the @xmath34 channel . at any @xmath65 and in either channel ,",

    "also highly preferred for the light sm - like @xmath40 of the mssm ) , and @xmath16 , the net error assuming an excellent cms - style calorimeter ( resolution case i ) falls in the ranges @xmath126 to @xmath127 at @xmath76 and @xmath126 to @xmath128 at @xmath17 . for @xmath16 and a calorimeter at the optimistic end of current plans for the nlc detector ( cases ii and iii )",

    "if the nlc is first operated at @xmath17 , either because a higgs boson has not been detected previously or because other physics (  production of supersymmetric particles ) is deemed more important , data will be accumulated with whatever calorimeter is part of the initial detector and a corresponding measurement of @xmath47 will result . the desirability of stopping data collection to upgrade the calorimeter and/or reconfigure the interaction region for full luminosity at the @xmath68 cross section maximum must be carefully evaluated . if the interaction region is not reconfigured for full luminosity at the lower @xmath68-channel @xmath115 . ] using the @xmath16 errors of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we find that it is _ not _ advantageous to reconfigure for @xmath76 if @xmath133 . the value of a calorimeter upgrade is also marginal for such @xmath48 . to illustrate , suppose the initial calorimeter has resolution ii or iii .",
    "for @xmath134 , upgrading the calorimeter from ii / iii to i , and then accumulating a 2nd @xmath16 at @xmath17 after doing so , would yield a net @xmath47 error of @xmath135 , as compared to @xmath136 if no changes are made and a total of @xmath137 is accumulated by simply running twice as long . for @xmath138 , upgrading the resolution would yield ( after the 2nd @xmath16 run at @xmath17 ) @xmath131 error vs. @xmath129 if no calorimeter change is made .",
    "however , for small @xmath48 , reconfiguration and high resolution calorimetery both become quite valuable at the nlc . for example , if @xmath139 ( roughly the current lep i / ii limit ) , a 2nd @xmath16 run with full @xmath140 at @xmath76 and upgrade to resolution i would yield @xmath141 error vs. @xmath142 after a 2nd @xmath16 run with no changes . for @xmath139 , running from the beginning for @xmath137 at the @xmath143 peak ( as possible at full luminosity if @xmath48 is known from lhc data ) with resolution i yields error of @xmath144 .    in evaluating different options / strategies ,",
    "it is necessary to keep in mind that lhc data may allow a rather competitive error for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "one combines the @xmath145 ( for atlas and cms combined ) lhc measurement of @xmath146 with the @xmath16 , @xmath17 nlc measurement of @xmath147 to obtain a value for @xmath47 with error @xmath148 for @xmath149 , rising to @xmath129 for @xmath150 .",
    "if we combine this @xmath47 error with the net error for the ( @xmath68 plus @xmath33-fusion mode , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , resolution ii / iii ) direct @xmath47 measurement at the nlc , the overall error for @xmath47 will be :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for most higgs masses , there would be little to gain from excellent ( case i ) resolution .",
    "for example , at @xmath151 , the above @xmath25 found assuming nlc resolution cases ii / iii would only improve to @xmath152 for nlc resolution case i. for @xmath153 , the nlc @xmath154 decay determination of @xmath155 will only be of value if @xmath137 with calorimeter resolution i can be accumulated by the time @xmath156 per detector is accumulated at the lhc .",
    "finally , if determining @xmath157 , and thence @xmath158 , is the dominant motivation for measuring @xmath47 , then it is important to note that for @xmath159 @xmath157 is better determined using the @xmath160 techniques discussed in ref .",
