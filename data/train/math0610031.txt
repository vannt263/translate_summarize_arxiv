    "given a configuration of @xmath1 lattice points @xmath2 in @xmath3 , let @xmath4 denote the generic polynomial in @xmath5 variables @xmath6 with exponents in @xmath2 . under certain general conditions , gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky",
    "@xcite showed that there exists an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients @xmath7 in the vector of coefficients @xmath8 ( defined up to sign ) , called the @xmath2-discriminant , which vanishes for each choice of coefficients @xmath9 for which @xmath10 and all its partial derivatives have a common root in the torus @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath2-discriminant is an affine invariant , in the sense that any configuration of points affinely isomorphic to @xmath2 has the same discriminant .",
    "given @xmath2 , we form the @xmath12 integer matrix ( also called @xmath2 ) whose first row consists of ones , and whose columns are given by the points @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "the kernel of this matrix expresses the affine dependencies among the given configuration of points .",
    "let @xmath15 be a matrix whose column vectors are a basis of the integer kernel of the matrix @xmath2 , i.e. a _ gale dual _ of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath16 is of full rank and its maximal minors have g.c.d .",
    "since the first row of @xmath2 is the vector @xmath18 , the row vectors of @xmath16 must always add up to @xmath19 .",
    "we say that @xmath16 is _ regular _ when this condition is satisfied .",
    "set @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath2-discriminant @xmath21 is @xmath2-homogeneous , i.e it is quasi - homogenous relative to the weight defined by any vector in the row span of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , `` taking out these homogeneities '' we get a polynomial @xmath22 in @xmath23 variables @xmath24 which is in fact the implicit equation of ( the closure of ) the image @xmath25 of the rational horn - kapranov parametrization @xcite defined by @xmath26 extracting the homogeneities means the following .",
    "as we said , there exists @xmath27 such that all monomials @xmath28 that occur in @xmath29 satisfy @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "write each @xmath36 as a linear combination of the columns @xmath37 of @xmath16 .",
    "then , there is a laurent polynomial @xmath38 in @xmath23 variables such that up to a monomial , @xmath39 equals @xmath40 . in particular",
    ", @xmath22 has the same number of monomials and the same coefficients as @xmath21 .    via the well known cayley trick",
    ", the computation of mixed sparse resultants may be reduced to the computation of sparse discriminants  @xcite .",
    "the computation of sparse discriminants @xmath21 ( including all sparse resultants ) , is then equivalent to the implicitization problem for the parametric varieties given by ( [ eq : psib ] ) .",
    "these implicitization problems are thus interesting and very hard , since they involve the whole of sparse elimination .",
    "it is easy to see that when the matrix @xmath41 defining the parametrization ( [ eq : psib ] ) is not of maximal rank @xmath23 , then @xmath25 is certainly not a hypersurface .",
    "this is the case in which the corresponding homogenized discriminant @xmath21 is just the constant polynomial @xmath42 .",
    "however , the image of the parametrization may fail to be a hypersurface even if @xmath16 is of maximal rank ( c.f .",
    "example  [ ex : def ] ) .",
    "the classification of such _ defective _ configurations is a hard combinatorial problem @xcite . on the other side",
    ", the condition of non defectiveness can be checked algorithmically .",
    "when trying to compute discriminants , natural reductions as in @xcite lead to integer matrices @xmath16 which are still regular and of maximal rank , but whose columns do not necessarily generate a saturated lattice @xmath43 , i.e. such that the gcd of its maximal minors takes any value @xmath44 . on the other side ,",
    "sparse discriminants describe the singular locus of @xmath2-hypergeometric systems of pde s , while the inhomogeneous discriminants @xmath22 describe the singular locus of classical horn hypergeometric differential equations @xcite . in this setting",
    ", it is again natural and necessary to consider matrices @xmath16 with arbitrary gcd @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "another interest on studying this case stems in the precise version we give of a result of kapranov @xcite , which asserts that the rational hypersurfaces they define have an interesting geometric characterization .    in this article",
    "we focus then on rational parametrizations of the form ( [ eq : psib ] ) for regular non defective integer matrices @xmath46 of maximal rank @xmath23 and any value of gcd @xmath47 .",
    "to emphasize the fact that the lattice generated by the columns of the matrix is not necessarily saturated ( equivalently , the lattice generated by the rows is not necessarily @xmath48 ) , we will call our matrix @xmath49 and we will keep the name @xmath16 in case @xmath17 . the irreducible equation of the closure of the image @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath51 $ ] , will be referred to as a generalized inhomogeneous discriminant .",
    "we prove in section  [ sec : one ] that , up to multiplication by an element @xmath52 , the parametrizations  la horn - kapranov associated to such matrices @xmath49 correspond precisely to those rational hypersurfaces @xmath50 for which the logarithmic gauss map is birational .",
    "in fact , we follow line by line kapranov s proof in @xcite and we correct slightly his statement in the sense that the condition @xmath53 is not necessary . in particular , we show that all such parametrizations are birational , thus recovering and explaining the results in ( * ? ? ? * section  3.3 ) .",
    "we then study in section  [ sec : two ] the precise relation between the generalized inhomogeneous discriminant @xmath54 which gives the equation of @xmath50 and the equation @xmath22 of @xmath25 , where the columns of @xmath16 are a @xmath55-basis of the saturated of the lattice @xmath56 spanned by the columns of @xmath49 .",
    "we also give other tips to simplify the search for the equation @xmath54 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : three ] we focus on the case @xmath57 . the case of codimension",
    "@xmath58 has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "we give a combinatorial algorithm for the computation of the degree of @xmath50 in case @xmath49 is uniform , based on the intersection formula  ( [ eq : fulton ] ) and the algorithm for the computation of local multiplicites at the base points given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.5 ) . this degree could be also obtained via theorem  2.2 in @xcite which should be made explicit to give a dehomogenized version of theorem  1.3 in that paper .",
    "it would be interesting to develop intersection formulas which do not require to take a common denominator in order to work in projective space , to avoid the new base points coming from this approach .",
    "we also give several examples which show the difficulty of computing the local multiplicities in the general case .",
    "we start by setting some notations and first consequences of the definition of the horn - kapranov rational parametrizations @xmath59 associated to @xmath49-matrices and their closed images @xmath50 .",
    "we then show that these parametrizations are proper ( i.e. @xmath60 ) and that ( torus translates of ) varieties of the form @xmath50 give all rational varieties with birational logarithmic gauss map .      given a matrix @xmath61 , @xmath62 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the row vectors of @xmath49 .",
    "each @xmath64 defines a linear form @xmath65    throughout this paper , we will always assume that @xmath49 is regular ( i.e. its columns sum up to zero ) , and has no zero rows .",
    "we associate to the matrix @xmath49 an algebraic variety @xmath50 in @xmath66 which is the closure of the image of the rational parametrization : @xmath67 where @xmath68 call @xmath69 the least common denominator of all the @xmath70 s , and write @xmath71 since the coordinates of the parametrization are given as a product of linear forms whose exponents sum up to @xmath19 , all @xmath72 have the same degree @xmath73 , where @xmath74 we can think of the mapping @xmath59 as a rational function between projective spaces @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined outside the _ base point locus _ @xmath77 .",
    "we again denote by @xmath50 the projective variety defined by the closure of the image of this map .",
    "the linear forms @xmath78 define a hyperplane arrangement in @xmath66 and in @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 be a flat in this arrangement , i.e. a linear space defined by the vanishing of a subset @xmath81 of the given linear forms .",
    "denote by @xmath82 all linear forms @xmath83 vanishing on @xmath80 , i.e. all linear forms @xmath83 which lie in the linear span of @xmath81 . note that a given @xmath84 vanishes on @xmath80 if and only if it contains a linear factor from @xmath85 .",
    "a given flat @xmath86 of the arrangement will be called _ basic _ if all of @xmath87 vanish on @xmath86 .",
    "we then have    [ lemma : bpl ] the base point locus @xmath88 equals the union of all basic flats .",
    "[ rmk : finitebp ] by taking out any common factor from @xmath87 , we can always assume that @xmath89 .",
    "then , in the case of codimension @xmath0 that we will study in section  [ sec : three ] we can assume without loss of generality that the number of base points is finite .",
    "note however that their local structure can be very complicated .",
    "when @xmath90 , the base point locus variety has in general positive dimension .",
    "recall that @xmath49 is called defective if @xmath91 .",
    "we easily have    [ lemma : def ] let @xmath61 be a regular matrix of rank @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath93 , so @xmath49 is defective .",
    "assume @xmath94 are linearly independent and write any other @xmath95 .",
    "it follows that @xmath96 can be written as homogeneous rational functions of @xmath97 of degree @xmath19 , and so they can be written as rational functions of the @xmath98 variables @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the codimension of @xmath50 is at least @xmath100 , as claimed .",
    "[ ex : def ] as we have remarked in the introduction , the converse to lemma  [ lemma : def ] is not true and the classification of defective matrices involves subtle combinatorial questions . as a simple example of a full rank defective matrix , let @xmath101 be even and @xmath102 arbitrary .",
    "pick any set of integer vectors @xmath103 whose @xmath104-linear span is @xmath105 and take @xmath106 for all @xmath107 . then , it is straightforward to check that @xmath59 is a constant map .",
    "we will assume from now on that @xmath49 has full rank @xmath23 , so that the gcd of its maximal minors @xmath108 is non zero .",
    "given an algebraic group @xmath109 with lie algebra @xmath110 , let @xmath111 denote the left translation by an element @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 be an irreducible algebraic hypersurface .",
    "gauss map _ of the hypersurface @xmath114 is the rational map @xmath115 , taking a smooth point @xmath116 to the hyperplane @xmath117 .",
    "the case which we are interested in is @xmath118 .",
    "so @xmath119 , and left translation is the usual coordinatewise multiplication map by an element in the torus . if @xmath114 is a hypersurface defined by a minimal equation @xmath120 , then the gauss map is simply @xmath121 mapping a regular point @xmath122 to a projective point in @xmath79 .",
    "assume @xmath123 is non empty .",
    "geometrically , the map @xmath124 corresponds to looking at the image of @xmath125 via the map @xmath126 and then considering the gauss map of @xmath127 .",
    "the following theorem is essentially due to kapranov  @xcite .",
    "our contribution lies in making the statement precise by removing the incorrect hypothesis about the gcd of the matrix defining the parametrization .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : two ] why a quick first thought may lead to conjecture that this gcd should equal @xmath42 ( cf .",

    "moreover , in this case , @xmath134 is birational and the logarithmic gauss map @xmath124 is its inverse .    as we said in the introduction ,",

    "we first give a simple example .",
    "[ cubic ] the @xmath2-discriminant associated to the @xmath137 matrix @xmath138 i.e. the discriminant @xmath139 of the generic polynomial @xmath140 equals @xmath141 equivalently , @xmath142 is the dual variety of the projectively embedded toric variety parametrized by monomials with exponents in @xmath2 , i.e. , the well known twisted cubic .",

    "we will study in section  [ sec : three ] the precise relation between the irreducible polynomials @xmath22 and @xmath54 .",

    "denote by @xmath185 an irreducible equation of its closed image .",
    "the principal observation is that the jacobian matrix of @xmath186 is symmetric since @xmath187 moveover , a straightforward computation shows that for any point @xmath188 in the preimage of the torus , the jacobian matrices @xmath189 and @xmath190 have the same rank since @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries the multiplicative inverses of the coordinates of @xmath193 .",
    "this rank is equal to @xmath194 by our hyphotesis that @xmath49 is non defective .",

    "since the coordinates of @xmath193 are homogeneous forms of degree @xmath19 , it follows from euler s formula applied to the coordinates of @xmath199 that any point @xmath188 in the preimage of the torus lies in the kernel of @xmath200 .",

    "so , we can always start simplifying the problem by making this replacement .",
