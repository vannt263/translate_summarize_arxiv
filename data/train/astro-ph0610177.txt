    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to be the most luminous electromagnetic explosions in the universe .",
    "these erratic , transient events in @xmath11-rays are followed by long - lived , decaying afterglows in longer wavelengths .",
    "the widely accepted model of this phenomenon is the fireball model ( mszros 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2005 ) , which depicts the observed prompt gamma - ray emission as the synchrotron emission from the internal shocks in an erratic , unsteady , relativistic fireball ( rees & mszros 1994 ) , and interprets the broadband afterglow emission as the synchrotron emission from an external shock that expands into the circumburst medium ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "the grb radiative efficiency , which is defined as _ , [ eta ] is an essential quantity to understand the nature of the bursts . here",
    "@xmath12 is the isotropic gamma - ray energy is different from that used in some other papers ( e.g. frail et al .",
    "2001 ) that denotes the geometry - corrected gamma - ray energy . ] and @xmath13 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the fireball right after the prompt gamma - ray emission is over .",
    "it gives a direct measure of how efficient the burster dissipates the total energy into radiation during the grb prompt emission phase .    in the pre-_swift",
    "_ era , only the late time fireball kinetic energy @xmath0 was derived or estimated using the late time afterglow data .",
    "two methods have been proposed .",
    "the most adequate one is through broadband afterglow modeling ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "this method requires well - sampled multi - wavelength afterglow data .",
    "the method thus can only be applied to a small sample of grbs .",
    "a more convenient method is to use the x - ray afterglow data alone ( freedman & waxman 2001 ; berger et al .",
    "2003 ; lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) . at a late enough epoch",
    "( e.g. 10 hours after the burst trigger ) , the x - ray band is likely above the cooling frequency , so that the x - ray flux gives a good measure of the degenerate quantity @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fraction of the electron energy in the internal energy of the shock .",
    "if @xmath15 could be estimated , one can then derive @xmath0 directly from the x - ray data . assuming a simple extrapolation of the late time light curve to earlier epochs , lloyd - ronning & zhang ( 2004 ) took into account the fireball radiative loss correction to estimate @xmath13 right after the prompt emission phase , and estimated the efficiency of 17 grbs / xrfs observed in the pre-_swift _ era .",
    "they discovered a shallow positive correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 or @xmath18 . according to this shallow correlation",
    ", softer , under - luminous bursts ( e.g. x - ray flashes ) tend to have a lower radiative efficiency .",
    "similar conclusions were also drawn by lamb et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "these previous grb efficiency studies employing the late afterglow data inevitably introduce some uncertainties on the @xmath13 measurements , including the possible corrections of radiative fireball energy loss and additional energy injection in the early afterglow phase . in order to reduce these uncertainties",
    "very early afterglow observations are needed .",
    "the successful operation of nasa s _ swift _ grb mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) makes this possible .",
    "very early x - ray afterglow data for a large number of grbs have been recorded by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on board _ swift _ ( burrows et al .",
    "2005a ) . a large sample of early x - ray afterglow data have been collected , typically 100 seconds after the triggers .",
    "these observations indeed show novel , unexpected behaviors in the early afterglow phase ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; burrows et al .",
    "2005b ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al . 2006 ; obrien et al . 2006 ) , and make it feasible to more robustly estimate @xmath13 and hence , @xmath16 .",
    "the xrt light curves of many bursts could be synthesized to a canonical light curve that is composed of 5 components ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , an early rapid decay component consistent with the tail of the prompt emission , a frequently - seen shallow - than - normal decay component likely originated from a refreshed external forward shock , a normal decay component due to a freely expanding fireball , an occasionally - seen post jet break segment , as well as erratic x - ray flares harboring in nearly half of _ swift _ grbs that are likely due to reactivation of the grb central engine .",
    "the most relevant segment for the efficiency problem is the shallow decay component ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "most of the _ swift_/xrt afterglow light curves in our sample have such an early shallow decay segment .",
    "the origin of this segment is currently not identified .",
    "if it is due to continuous energy injection , the initial afterglow energy @xmath0 must be significantly smaller than estimated using the late time data .",
    "the previous efficiency analysis using late x - ray afterglow data then tend to overestimate @xmath0 , and hence , underestimate @xmath16 .",
    "the early tight uvot upper limits for many swift grbs are also likely related to this shallow decay component ( roming et al .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to revisit the efficiency problem using the very early xrt data .",
    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs , heise et al . 2001 ; kippen et al .",
    "2002 ) naturally extend long - duration grbs into the softer and fainter regime ( e.g. lamb et al .",
    "2005 ; sakamoto et al .",
    "it is now known that the softness of the bursts is not due to their possible high redshifts ( soderberg et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the remaining possibilities include either extrinsic ( e.g. viewed at different viewing angles , yamazaki et al . 2002 , 2004 ; zhang et al .",
    "2004a , b ; liang & dai 2004a ; huang et al . 2004 ) , or intrinsic ( e.g. different burst parameters such as lorentz factor , luminosity , etc , dermer et al .",
    "1999 ; kobayashi et al . 2002 ; mszros et al . 2002",
    "; zhang & mszros 2002c ; huang et al .",
    "2002 ; rees & mszros 2005 ; barraud et al .",
    "2005 ) reasons .",
    "the radiative efficiency of xrfs may provide a clue to identify the correct mechanism .",
    "previous analyses of late time x - ray data suggest that the xrfs typically have lower radiative efficiencies ( soderberg et al . 2004 ; lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ; lamb et al .",
    "it is desirable to investigate whether this is still true with the early afterglow data .",
    "recently , afterglows of several short - duration grbs have been detected ( gehrels et al . 2005 ; fox et al .",
    "2005 ; villasenor et al . 2005 ; hjorth et al . 2005 ; barthelmy et al . 2005a ; berger et al .",
    "the data suggest that they are distinct from long grbs and very likely have different progenitor systems .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to explore the radiative efficiencies of short - hard grbs ( shgs ) and compare them with those of long grbs .    in this paper",
    "we systematically analyze the prompt emission and the early afterglow data for a sample of 31 grbs detected by _ swift _ before september 2005 through reducing the burst alert telescope ( bat , barthelmy et al .",
    "2005b ) and xrt data .",
    "we present the sample and the bat / xrt data analysis methods in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the gamma - to - x fluence ratio ( @xmath19 ) is an observation - defined apparent grb efficiency indicator .",
    "we perform statistical analysis of this parameter in  [ sec : rel - eff ] . in  [ sec : model ] , we perform more detailed theoretical modeling to estimate @xmath13 (  [ sec : ek ] ) and @xmath16 (  [ sec : eta ] ) .",
    "our results are summarized in  [ sec : conclusion ] with some discussion . throughout the paper the cosmological parameters @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23",
    "have been adopted .",
    "our sample includes 31 grbs observed by _ swift _ before september 1 , 2005 .",
    "the bat - xrt joint early x - ray afterglow light curves of these bursts and the detailed data reduction procedures have been presented in obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the bat data have been processed using the standard bat analysis software ( _ swift _ software v. 2.0 ) .",
    "the bat - band gamma - ray fluence @xmath24 could be directly derived from the data . for the purpose of estimating grb efficiency , on the other hand",
    ", one needs to estimate the total energy output of the grb , which requires to extrapolate @xmath24 to a wider bandpass to get @xmath25 ( @xmath26 kev adopted in this paper ) .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the spectral parameters of the prompt emission .",
    "it is well known that the grb spectrum is typically fitted by a band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is a smoothly - joint - broken power law characterized by two photon indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( with the convention @xmath29 adopted throughout the text ) and a break energy @xmath30 .",
    "the peak energy of the @xmath31 spectrum is @xmath32 . in order to derive these parameters ,",
    "the observed spectrum of a burst should cover the energy band around @xmath30 .",
    "the spectra of both long and short grbs observed by cgro / batse ( covering 20 - 2000 kev ) are well fitted by the band - function , with the typical values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 kev ( preece et al . 2000 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "the spectra of xrfs could be also fitted by the band - function , typically with @xmath33 and a lower @xmath28 than typical grbs ( lamb et al .",
    "2005 , sakamoto et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; cui et al .",
    "bat has a narrower energy band ( 15 - 150 kev ) than batse and hete-2 .",
    "the typical @xmath18 of the bright batse sample is well above the bat band .",
    "bat s observations therefore can not well constrain @xmath18 and @xmath28 for many grbs .",
    "most observed spectra by bat are well fitted by a simple power law .",
    "however , this is due to the intrinsic limitation of the instrument .",
    "four grbs in our sample , i.e. grbs 050401 , 050525a , 050713a , and 050717 , were simultaneously observed by _ konus - wind _ ( with an energy band of 20 - 2000 kev ) .",
    "the spectra of these bursts could be also well fitted by a band - function or a cutoff power law spectrum ( golenetskii et al .",
    "2005a - d , krimm et al .",
    "we assume that the broad band spectra of all the bursts in our sample could be fitted by the band - function and then make the corrections to the observed fluences . our procedure to derive spectral parameters are as follows .",
    "for more detailed data analysis procedure and burst parameters , we refer the readers to the _ swift _ first catalog paper ( l. angelini et al . 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "we first fit an observed spectrum with a band - function , a power law with exponential cutoff , and a simple power law , respectively . by comparing reduced @xmath36 of these fits",
    ", we pick up the best - fit model among the three . in our sample , only 4 grbs ( 050128 , 050219a , 050525a and 050716 ) could be well fitted by a band function , if one assigns @xmath28 in the range of @xmath37 to @xmath38 for typical grbs , @xmath28 could be as low as @xmath39 for xrfs ( e.g. cui et al . 2005 ; sakamoto et al .",
    "2005 ) . ] . due to the great uncertainty of @xmath28",
    ", the cutoff power law model could also fit these 4 bursts , with the cutoff energy being in the bat band .",
    "the rest 27 bursts in the sample are best fitted by a simple power law , with the photon index @xmath40 ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "for the 8 grbs with the band - function parameters available ( grbs 050128 , 050219a , 050401 , 050525a , 050713a , 050716 , 050717 , and 051221 ) either from a fit to the bat data or from a joint bat-_konus - wind _ fit , we make straightforward extrapolation of @xmath24 to derive @xmath25 in the @xmath26 kev band .",
    "for the rest 24 bursts whose observed spectra are fitted by a simple power law , the extrapolation is not straightforward .",
    "generally we employ the hardness ratio information to place additional constraints to the spectral parameters .",
    "the analyses are carried out on case - to - case base . nonetheless , depending on the value of @xmath40 , one could crudely group the cases into three categories",
    ".    case i : @xmath43 ( 16 out of 24 in the sample ) . since for typical bursts in the batse sample one has @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( preece et al . 2000 ) , it is expected that a rough fit to the band function by a simple power law would lead to @xmath40 in this range .",
    "the break energy @xmath30 of these bursts should be within or near the edges of the bat band .",
    "the hardness ratio ( @xmath44 ) , which in our analysis is defined as the ratio of the fluence in the 50 - 100 kev band to that in the 25 - 50 kev band , could be directly measured from the simple pl fit model .",
    "theoretically , on the other hand , @xmath44 is a function of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 for the band - function model ( cui et al .",
    "2005 , see fig.[hr ] ) .",
    "one can then in principle apply @xmath44 as another agent to constrain the spectral parameters by requiring @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the hardness ratio derived from the band - function model and from the data , respectively . to proceed ,",
    "we first assign a set of `` standard '' guess values to the spectral parameters , e.g. @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 kev , and then perform a band - function fit to the data .",
    "we then derive @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 from the best fit , which usually deviate from the guess values .",
    "generally , these parameters have very large error bars .",
    "we then apply the @xmath44 criterion to the results .",
    "if the calculated @xmath46 using the best - fit parameters match @xmath47 well , this set of parameters are taken .",
    "otherwise , we adjust spectral parameters to achieve the best match .",
    "the process is eased thanks to several properties of the @xmath51 relation ( fig.[hr ] ) .",
    "first , when @xmath18 is high enough ( say , higher than 30 kev ) , @xmath44 is essentially independent on @xmath28 .",
    "also for @xmath52 , most energy is emitted around @xmath18 and the extrapolated broad band fluence is insensitive to @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore take the best - fit @xmath28 value or fix it to @xmath53 when @xmath28 is poorly constrained .",
    "@xmath46 therefore mainly depends on @xmath27 and @xmath30 .",
    "another interesting feature is that as one decreases @xmath27 ( i.e. softer spectrum ) , the corresponding @xmath30 would increase given the same observed spectrum .",
    "the resulting @xmath54 , on the other hand , is not very sensitive to @xmath27 since the variations of @xmath27 and @xmath30 cancel out each other . as a result",
    ", we simply adjust @xmath27 to re - fit the spectrum until @xmath46 is consistent with @xmath47 within the error range .",
    "these spectral parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath18 , @xmath28 ) are then taken to perform extrapolation to estimate @xmath25 . since the determinations of both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not fully based on fitting procedures , it is very difficult to quantify their errors , and we only report their estimated values .",
    "the error of @xmath30 is taken whenever possible based on the best band - function fit ( see table 1 ) .",
    "case ii : @xmath55 ( 2 out of 24 in the sample : grbs 050726 and 050826 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath30 should be far beyond the bat band , and bat only covers the low energy part of the spectrum ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "one has @xmath57 or slightly larger ( if @xmath18 is not very far above the band ) .",
    "it is very difficult to estimate @xmath30 ( @xmath18 ) in this case .",
    "nonetheless , one could use @xmath47 to pose some constraints .",
    "figure [ hr ] suggests that @xmath46 converges to a maximum value at high @xmath18 s given a certain @xmath27 .",
    "we first let @xmath58 and check whether @xmath47 is consistent with @xmath46 .",
    "for both bursts in our sample one has @xmath59 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath27 should be larger than @xmath40 .",
    "we then gradually increase @xmath27 until @xmath60 becomes consistent with @xmath47 . using this @xmath27 one",
    "can then fit for @xmath30 ( and @xmath18 ) . according to fig.[hr ] ,",
    "there is great degeneracy of @xmath30 ( @xmath18 ) at @xmath61 .",
    "the fitted @xmath30 ( @xmath18 ) therefore has very large errors and is unstable . in practice",
    ", one could only set a lower limit of @xmath30 ( @xmath18 ) below which @xmath46 starts to deviate from @xmath47 . as a result ,",
    "only lower limits of @xmath18 of these two bursts are reported in table 1 .",
    "case iii : @xmath62 ( 6 out of 24 in the sample ) . in this case",
    ", the burst is likely an xrf with @xmath18 near or below the low energy end of bat .",
    "bat s observation likely only covers the high energy part of the spectrum ( @xmath63 ) . in order to constrain the spectral parameters using the hardness ratio data , we assume @xmath48 and @xmath64 and fit for @xmath30 by requiring @xmath65 . according to fig.[hr ] , near @xmath66 , @xmath46 is rather insensitive to @xmath30 ( @xmath18 ) . for most of the cases",
    ", one could find a solution of @xmath30 , but with very large errors .",
    "the solutions are also unstable .",
    "for these cases , we do not report errors in table 1 , but only report the best fit value with a @xmath67 symbol s are not reported . ] . for two cases ( grbs 050416a and 050819 )",
    ", there is no solution since @xmath68 .",
    "similar to the case ii , we then lower @xmath28 until a solution is found . due to the degeneracy of @xmath30 ( @xmath18 ) with @xmath44 , only upper limits of @xmath30 ( @xmath18 ) are found , which are reported in table 1 .    with the spectral parameters derived from the above method , we have extrapolated the observed 15 - 150 kev fluence @xmath24 to a broader energy range ( @xmath26 kev ) .",
    "the derived @xmath25 is regarded as the total energy output during the prompt phase for further efficiency studies .",
    "the results of prompt emission data are reported in table 1 .",
    "we caution that due to the intrinsic instrumental limitation , the uncertainties of the results are large .",
    "nonetheless , we have made the best use of the available data ( especially the hardness ratio information ) to derive the parameters .",
    "figure [ test ] displays the robustness of the method .",
    "fig.[test]a shows the criterion adopted in analyzing each burst ( eq.[[criterion ] ] ) .",
    "fig.[test]b shows how the @xmath18 s derived with our method compares with the @xmath69 derived from the konus - wind or hete-2 data for 8 bursts .",
    "the result suggests that our derived @xmath18 meets @xmath69 well for moderate @xmath18 s ( i.e. those falling into the bat band ) , but deviate from @xmath69 when @xmath18 is very large .",
    "notice that the reported @xmath18 errors in our method are derived from the best fit by fixing @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the real errors should also include the uncertainties of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in such cases , the errors of @xmath18 s could be larger to be more consistent with @xmath69 in the high-@xmath18 regime .",
    "however , due to the difficulty of estimating these errors , they are not included in reported errors .    in fig.[dist1 ]",
    ", we show the distributions of @xmath44 and @xmath18 of our sample . for the @xmath18 distribution ( right panel ) , those of the batse sample ( preece et al .",
    "2000 ) and the hete-2 sample ( lamb et al . 2005 ) are also plotted for comparison .",
    "our sample is generally consistent with the hete-2 sample , and tends to be softer than the batse sample ( as is expected because of a softer bandpass of bat as compared with batse ) .",
    "if one defines xrfs as those bursts with @xmath70 , the number ratio of the xrfs and the grbs in our sample is @xmath71 , being consistent the hete-2 result ( lamb et al . 2005 ) .",
    "an interesting feature is the marginal bimodal distribution of xrfs and grbs , which is consistent with the previous result derived with the hete-2 data ( liang & dai 2004 , cf .",
    "sakamoto et al . 2005 ) . in fig.[dist2 ] , we plot the distribution of @xmath25 as compared with the batse results .",
    "the energy range of @xmath25 is re - scaled to 20 - 2000 kev ( batse s energy band ) .",
    "we find that the two distributions are generally consistent with each other , except that swift grb sample extends the batse sample to lower fluences .",
    "this is expected because swift is more sensitive than batse .      the x - ray afterglow light curves and the spectra of the bursts in our sample have been presented by obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . among the 5 components of the synthetic x - ray lightcurve ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , the steep decay component is due to the grb tail emission ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) and the x - ray flares are due to the late central engine activity ( burrows et al .",

    "while grbs correspond to the cases when observers view the bright core component ( e.g. the line of sight is inside the typical gaussian angle ) , xrfs are those cases when observers view the off - axis jet at a larger viewing angle . as long",
    "as the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta is still relativistic in these directions , the prompt emission of xrfs is weaker ( because of the low energy in the direction ) but with a comparable efficiency as in the core direction , since the initial kinetic energy in the direction is also low .",
    "later as the jet is decelerated , the observer in the off - axis direction would progressively receive the energy contribution from the energetic core so that the light curve shows an early shallow decay ( e.g. kumar & granot 2003 ; salmonson 2003 ) .",

    "( zhang et al . 2004b ; huang et al . 2004 ; liang & dai 2004 ; peng et al . 2005 ) could be consistent with the data as long as the second component is not distinct enough to result in noticeable light curve features that are not detected .",
    "power law structured jets ( zhang & mszros 2002b ; rossi et al . 2002 ) may also interpret xrfs ( jin & wei 2004 ; dalessio et al .",
    "2006 ) , but the model predicts too large a xrf population ( lamb et al . 2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "finally , the varying opening angle model for xrfs invoke very wide jets for xrfs ( lamb et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , there is no straightforward reason to expect the significant change of @xmath0 ( and hence , @xmath16 ) at early times in this model .",
    "it is possible that the shallow decay phase is not due to energy injection . numerical simulations ( kobayashi & zhang 2006 ) suggest that the time scale for a fireball to transfer energy from the ejecta to the medium is long",
    ". it could be that the observed shallow decay phase reflects the epochs during which the energy transfer is going on .",
    "a poynting - flux - dominated flow may further extend the energy transfer period further due to the inability of tapping kinetic energy of the shell with the presence of a reverse shock ( zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath219 is the relevant kinetic energy to define grb efficiency , and xrfs are then indeed intrinsically inefficient grbs ( e.g. barraud et al . 2005 ) .",
    "more detailed early data and modeling are needed to reveal whether such a possibility holds .",
    "the absolute value of radiative efficiency is subject to the uncertainties of afterglow parameters . by inspecting the spectral index and the temporal decay index of the x - ray afterglows ,",
    "we identify 22 bursts whose afterglow cooling frequency is below the x - ray band . in this regime",
    "the radiative efficiency is insensitive to parameters except for @xmath15 .",
    "assuming @xmath4 , we find that @xmath220 of most bursts are smaller than @xmath221 , while @xmath222 ranges from a few percents to @xmath223 .",
    "some bursts have a low efficiency throughout , and they correspond to those bursts whose x - ray afterglow light curve smoothly join the prompt emission light curve without a distinct steep decay component or an extended shallow decay component .",
    "the standard internal shock models predict that the grb efficiency is only around @xmath224 ( kumar 1999 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "our results indicate that some grbs satisfy such a constraint . on the other hand , a group of grbs with an early shallow decay component challenge the internal shock model if @xmath83 is the relevant quantity to define the efficiency , as is required in most energy injection models .",
    "suggestions have been made in the literature to increase the efficiency ( e.g. beloborodov 2000 ; kobayashi & sari 2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2004 ; rees & mszros 2005 ; peer et al . 2005 ) . for those models that invoke @xmath219 to define the efficiency ( e.g. ioka et al . 2006 ; kobayashi & zhang 2006 ) , the data are consistent with the expectation of the internal shock model .",
    "the typical efficiency in such a case is @xmath221 or lower .",
    "the three short grbs ( 050724 , 050813 and 051221a ) have similar efficiencies as long grbs at both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , despite their distinct progenitor systems ( gehrels et al . 2005 ; fox et al . 2005 ; villasenor et al .",
    "2005 ; hjorth et al .",
    "2005 ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ; berger et al . 2005c ; bloom et al .",
    "such a trend is being verified by more and more short grb data , and will be reinforced by a larger sample of short grbs in the future .    \\7 .",
    "although most of the x - ray afterglows in our sample are above the cooling frequency , 9 grbs do have a cooling frequency higher than the x - ray band for a very long time , suggesting a very small @xmath9 and/or a low medium density @xmath225 .",
    "an extremely low medium density may not be at odd for long grbs .",
    "if some of these long grbs explode in superbubbles created by precedented supernovae or grbs , the ambient medium could reach such a low density .",
