    "a variety of pursuit / evasion problems may be treated by the methods of differential game theory .  @xcite these range from idealized problems of an illustrative nature , such as the homicidal chauffeur or two cars games ,  @xcite to detailed studies of optimal strategies in air - to - air combat .",
    "@xcite in a previous paper  @xcite , a qualitative criterion for interception or capturability was devised for a class of differential games of kind suggested by pontryagin .",
    "@xcite the criterion is a simple one : let the _ future cone _ @xmath0 be the set of all attainable trajectories available to a player subsequent to some initial time .",
    "interception of the target by the interceptor is _ guaranteed _ to be possible if @xmath1 subject to additional assumptions given below .",
    "the condition takes the form of a dominant strategy nash equillibrium , in that , no matter how the target maneuvers , the interceptor can always maneuver to intercept it at some point to the future of both .",
    "section [ newtheorem ] provides a new proof of the main result of ref .",
    ", based on the lefschetz fixed - point theorem , which relaxes assumptions regarding the convexity of subsets of the future cones made in ref . .",
    "in section [ futurecones ] , the criterion is applied to the classic problem of the game of two cars , and to the problem of two spacecraft maneuvering in a central gravitational field .",
    "this latter problem is applicable to the study of a direct - ascent antisatellite weapon ( asat ) engaging a spacecraft in low earth orbit .",
    "an account of the january 2007 interception of the fengyun-1c meteorological satellite by a chinese asat appears in section [ fy1c ] as a worked example .    following a discussion of the results in section [ wottdoesitmean ] ,",
    "a final section [ byby ] presents conclusions .",
    "this paper is concerned with differential games that describe the pursuit of a target with position @xmath2 at time @xmath3 , by an interceptor whose position at time @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "both target and interceptor can maneuver freely and autonomously , subject to constraints .",
    "the evolution of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is of the form @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are assumed to be bounded analytic functions , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are piecewise analytic controls .",
    "we recall the definition of the future cone of a maneuvering player as given in ref . , and review its properties .",
    "the net effect of propulsive forces and of external forces such as gravity or aerodynamic drag cause the position @xmath13 of the interceptor ( respectively , target ) to evolve as it maneuvers .",
    "the evolution will be continuous , but not necessarily differentiable .",
    "in addition , target and interceptor will be subject to physical limitations on their peak acceleration or total velocity change @xmath14 .",
    "finally , target and interceptor may be expected to interact within a compact subset of @xmath15 .    at an initial time @xmath16 ,",

    "we call the set of points subsequently accessible to the interceptor in the time interval @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the _ future cone _ of @xmath21 , written @xmath22 .    following ref . , we assume that the subset of either cone lying to the future of its vertex is a manifold with compact closure possessing a timelike foliation .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath23 a leaf of the foliation corresponding to a time @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , there is no assumption that future cones of either target or interceptor , or their leaves , are necessarily convex .",

    "these studies variously treat games of degree or of kind , but all restrict the form of the game to facilitate its analysis , by means such as limitation to a linear game , or to fixed velocity ratios for the players , or to piecewise constant radii of curvature .",
    "we work here with ( [ eq : xeqn ] ) and ( [ eq : yeqn ] ) in fairly general form , but restrict attention to the more limited goal of finding qualitative conditions under which we may be confident that the interceptor can force an interception , optimally or no .",
    "the winning strategy for the interceptor is to choose a trajectory that intercepts the target at some time to the future of @xmath16 .",
    "this choice amounts to a mapping @xmath24 from the set of all trajectories available to the interceptor to its desired _ actual _ trajectory .",
    "a _ guaranteed intercept _ will be said to exist when an interception solution always exists , no matter how the target maneuvers within its future cone .",

    "on or about 22:26 utc 11 january 2007 , a direct - ascent antisatellite weapon launched from the territory of the people s republic of china intercepted , and destroyed , the chinese fengyun-1c weather satellite .",

    "it was designed for a two - year mission duration .",
    "a replacement spacecraft , fengyun-1d , was launched in may 2002 , but fengyun-1c remained operational into 2005 and evidently responded to ground commands as late as january 2007 .",
    "@xcite    while the instrument suite and data products of the fengyun meteorological instruments are documented in numerous sources , not many descriptions of the spacecraft have appeared .",
    "fengyun-1c is variously described as having a mass between 880 and 960 kg .",
    "the fengyun-1 series spacecraft were three - axis stabilized by a combination of reaction wheels and cold nitrogen jets . a 1999 report from the foreign broadcast information service",
    "cites an account of fengyun-1a appearing in the journal of chinese society of astronautics that claims the attitude control system carried 12 kg of nitrogen at launch .",
    "@xcite in an account of the debris cloud resulting from the destruction of fengyun-1c , ref .",
    "remarks that at launch , the spacecraft mass was 958 kg , but at its end - of - life , the mass was 880 kg .",
    "one may interpret this as an upper limit for the reaction mass available for attitude control of 78 kg , again presumably nitrogen gas .",
    "the application of the results from the preceding section to analysis of the fengyun-1c interception of january 2007 is straightforward .",
    "one estimates the future cone of the target subsequent to some fiducial time , granted credible assumptions about its residual @xmath14 , and compares this to a model of the future cone of the interceptor for a stipulated engagement scenario .",
    "a practical method for computational purposes is supplied by monte carlo . by virtue of theorem 4",
    ", it suffices to pick a number of elements of @xmath227 for each player and ( so to speak ) observe the fall of shot .",
    "the initial position and velocity of fengyun-1c at the start of the engagement is calculated from a two - line element set obtained from spacetrack  @xcite , using the aerospace corporation s satellite orbital analysis program ( soap )  @xcite to propogate the fengyun-1c state to the target cone vertex .",
    "we use a model of the asat developed by g. forden of mit .",
    "@xcite forden s model assumes that the chinese direct - ascent asat is based on the two - stage solid - fueled df-21 irbm with a small interceptor of mass @xmath318 as a third stage .",
    "the df-21 stages are modeled as 1.4 m in diameter , with stage 1 being 5.1 m in length , stage 2 1.8 m in length .",
    "a center - perforated grain consisting of a double base propellant is assumed for both stages , with an @xmath319 of 225 seconds for the first stage and an @xmath319 of 230 seconds for the second .",
    "each stage burns for 36 seconds .",
    "the model neglects @xmath14 of the third stage .",
    "the vertex for the asat cone was arbitrarily chosen as the point in its flyout at which the asat altitude exceeds 104 km , using the same launch azimuth and initial pitch assumed in forden s analysis . at this point in the flight profile ,",
    "the missile is late in its second stage burn",
    ". the total @xmath14 used to calculate @xmath320 is obtained from ( [ eq : rocketeqn ] ) using the partially expended second plus third stage mass for @xmath321 and the second stage tare plus third stage mass for @xmath322 .",
    "this procedure presumably overestimates slightly the @xmath14 likely available to the actual asat very near the cone vertex , but should be accurate enough for illustrative purposes .",
    "the change in rocket velocity @xmath14 resulting from the exhaust of reaction mass is given by the rocket equation @xmath323 where @xmath319 is the specific impulse in seconds , @xmath324 is the gravitational acceleration at sea level , and @xmath321 and @xmath322 are the initial and final masses of the rocket , respectively .",
    "the ideal specific impulse for a cold nitrogen gas jet is given as 76 seconds in ref .",
    "the range 12 kg-78 kg for the estimated available reaction mass equates to a total @xmath14 in the range @xmath325 to @xmath326 , assuming a tare mass of 880 kg for fengyun-1c .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath325 is used to calculate the fengyun-1c future cone @xmath327 on the ground that this value corresponds to an overestimate of the likely @xmath14 available to the spacecraft . even were the total @xmath328 initially , by january 2007 the reaction mass",
    "would almost certainly have been quite depleted .",
    "the vertex of the fengyun-1c cone is chosen at the time of asat launch .",
    "the superposition of the future cone @xmath320 of the asat and that part of the cone @xmath327 for fengyun-1c lying within @xmath320 is presented in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] as random - dot stereograms with approximately antipodal viewing geometries .",
    "the nominal encounter time 22:26:00 occurs at 450 seconds talo . in the interval during which the cones intersect , @xmath329 and theorem 1 guarantees the asat can intercept fengyun-1c .    that the asat could intercept fengyun-1c is hardly a novel conclusion - this much was demonstrated beyond dispute on 11 january 2007",
    "admittedly , fengyun-1c appears to have served as a passive target .",
    "@xcite consider , however , a hypothetical scenario in which fengyun-1c maneuvers during the engagement .",
    "the disparity in expansion between the cones @xmath330 and @xmath320 underscores the inability of fengyun-1c to evade the asat .",
    "if anything , this exercise understates the vulnerability of fengyun-1c on that date : the cone @xmath327 is computed assuming that the total @xmath14 remaining in the attitude control system would actually be available to the spacecraft for maneuver .",
    "it is unlikely this assumption holds in practice . at a minimum ,",
    "the actual @xmath14 is limited by the total thrust the cold nitrogen jets are capable of producing if operated in a configuration that produces net impulse , even on the assumption that operators on the ground issue evasive commands .",
    "it was noted in ref . that ( [ eq : nash2 ] ) in theorem 1 amounts to establishing a ( dominant strategy ) nash equillibrium : the target may move to any position available in its future , but so long as the interceptor s future contains that of the target , the interceptor can always maneuver to some future position @xmath331 of the target .",
    "cockayne  @xcite uses the telling phrase `` against all opposition '' to describe the corresponding situation in the game of two cars ( _ vide . _ isaacs ref .",
    ", p. 202 , as well ) .",
    "theorem 1 was proved for simply connected future cones , but can be applied to certain multiply connected ones .",
    "if multiply connected future cones of target and interceptor are manifolds with a timelike foliation and are the finite union of polyhedra of simply connected simplicial complices , one may invoke theorem 1 for individual polyhedra .",
    "thus , if @xmath332 where each @xmath333 is a simply connected polyhedron and a subset @xmath334 of @xmath335 is a simply connected polyhedron ( or other acyclic absolute neighborhood retract ) such that @xmath336 for some @xmath337 then the existence of a guaranteed interception opportunity follows in any polyhedron of the interceptor cone that contains @xmath334 .",
    "this approach is presumably necessary for a treatment of the game of two cars that relaxes the simplifying conditions regarding initial velocity and cone vertex times made in section [ 2cars ] .",
    "theorems 2 - 4 need not give a good account of the future cone of a spacecraft for which the assumption that it may expend the entirety of its available @xmath14 in a single maneuver at the cone vertex is a poor approximation .",
    "in that event @xmath338 remains true , but it may happen that @xmath339 .",
    "a proper treatment of this case with the results of section [ kepler ] requires considering a sequence of future cones , for each of which the @xmath340 available in a given time interval of its motion is used in place of @xmath341 .",
    "the sample problems worked in section [ futurecones ] show that the future cone construction based on theorem 1 offers a simple method of determining when a class of differential pursuit / evasion games of kind , in which both players maneuver freely , is guaranteed to have interception of the target as a possible outcome .",
    "the method of analysis presented in section [ kepler ] is applicable to direct - ascent and co - orbital asat engagements .",
    "the specific example of the fengyun-1c interception by a direct - ascent asat demonstrates the applicability of the method to the study of a pursuit / evasion game of considerable practical interest .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper and its predecessor may also be taken to apply , if only as a _ reducto ad absurdum _ , to directed energy weapon attacks with a free line - of - sight to the target satellite .",
