    "@xcite proposed that the accretion disk temperature decreases with increasing black hole mass , and the fraction of the photons with the energy that can ionize the blr decreases .",
    "this may account for the weak line emission in some agns .",
    "they suggested that , the quasar will be lineless if the fraction of the accretion disk emission above the frequency @xmath107 hz is less than @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , while a weak line quasar appears if @xmath110 .",
    "pg 1407 + 265 is the first wlq studied in detail @xcite .",
    "we calculate the fraction of disk - corona emission above the frequency , @xmath111 , which satisfies the wlq criterion suggested by @xcite .",
    "we compare these two sources with the well studied blazar sample @xcite .",
    "we find that these two sources roughly follow the blazar sequence defined by the blazar sample , and also compare the relation of jet power and disk luminosity with that of blazars .",
    "we find that these two sources do not deviate much from the blazars , except the source pg 1407 + 265 , if its ir component is assumed to be from the dust torus and the x - ray emission is the synchrotron emission from the jet .",
    "we summarize the main conclusions of this paper as follows .",
    "the optical / uv emission of iii zw 2 is dominantly from the accretion disk .",
    "the x - ray emission should be dominated by the radiation from the jet , while the contribution of the disk corona is negligible .",
    "\\3 . the optical / uv component in the sed of pg 1407 + 265 can be well modeled as the emission from the accretion disk , while the ir component is attributed to the thermal radiation from the dust torus with an opening angle @xmath1 .",
    "if the x - ray continuum emission is dominantly from the jet , the source should be a  high peak frequency blazar \" , which obviously deviates the normal blazar sequence .",
    "the observed sed can also be fitted quite well by the accretion disk / corona model with the viscosity parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the spectrum of the accretion disk / corona in the wlq pg 1407 + 265 satisfies the wlq criterion suggested by @xcite .",
