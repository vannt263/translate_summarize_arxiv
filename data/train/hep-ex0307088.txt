    "pentaquark resonances have been predicted decades ago and there have been experimental searches for many years .",
    "however , no significant signal was found in the early work .",
    "recent theoretical work based on the chiral soliton model @xcite made more quantitative predictions for the masses and widths of a spin @xmath6 anti - decuplet of 5-quark states ( @xmath7 ) . using the @xmath8 resonance as the `` anchor '' for the masses of the anti - decuplet , the lowest lying member , @xmath1 ,",
    "is predicted to have a mass 1530 mev@xmath9 and a width of @xmath10 mev@xmath9 .",
    "it is predicted to be an exotic baryon state with strangeness @xmath0 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the leps collaboration at the spring-8 facility in japan recently reported @xcite the observation of an @xmath0 baryon at 1.54 gev@xmath9 with a width of @xmath12 mev@xmath9 from the reaction @xmath13 where the target neutron is bound in carbon , and the residual nucleus is assumed to be a spectator .",
    "this measurement reported a statistical significance of @xmath14 . also , the diana collaboration at itep @xcite recently announced results from an analysis of bubble - chamber data for the reaction @xmath15 , where the neutron is bound in a xenon nucleus , which shows a narrow peak at @xmath16 mev@xmath9 .",
    "the statistical significance of the itep result is 4.4 @xmath17 .",
    "the data presented here were taken at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility with the clas detector @xcite and the photon tagging system @xcite in hall b. data from two experiments have been used in these analyses : i ) photoproduction on deuterium using tagged photons produced by @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev electrons ; and ii ) photoproduction on protons using tagged photons produced by @xmath20 and @xmath21 gev electrons .",
    "the exclusive reaction @xmath22 was studied in the analysis of the deuteron data .",
    "a peak in the invariant mass distribution of @xmath5 was found at @xmath23 gev@xmath9 with a width of @xmath24 mev@xmath9 and the statistical significance @xmath25 .",
    "the reaction @xmath26 was studied using the hydrogen data .",
    "a peak at @xmath27 gev@xmath9 with a width of @xmath28 mev@xmath9 in the invariant mass distribution of @xmath5 was found in this reaction as well .",
    "the statistical significance of this peak is @xmath29 .",
    "in the photoproduction on deuterium the @xmath1 can be produced directly on the neutron in the reaction @xmath30 , similar to the reaction mechanism used by the leps collaboration . while the proton is a spectator in the direct production reaction and",
    "will not be detected in most cases , there are other ways to excite the @xmath1 . due to the final state interactions",
    "the proton can obtain high momentum and be detected .",
    "fig.[fig : gdz ] shows rescattering diagrams that may contribute to the production of the @xmath1 in the photoproduction on deuterium .",
    "for identification of such reactions the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are detected , and the neutron is identified in the missing mass analysis .",
    "although these reactions have a smaller cross section compared to the direct production because of an additional rescattering , they have the following advantages : i ) the @xmath33s that are produced predominantly in the forward direction in the direct production mechanism will scatter at larger angles and will have higher probability of detection in clas ; ii ) the kinematics of such exclusive reactions puts additional constraints on the event selection that help to clean up the event sample significantly , and iii ) due to the exclusive kinematics no fermi momentum corrections are needed for the correct calculation of @xmath34 .",
    "the analysis focused on events with one detected proton , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( and no other charged particles ) in the final state .",
    "either the @xmath32 or the @xmath33 in the event was required to have a time at the interaction vertex within 1.5 nsec of the proton s vertex time .",
    "also , the incident photon time at the interaction vertex was required to be within 1.0 nsec of the proton to eliminate accidental coincidences .",
    "the missing mass ( @xmath35 ) distribution of selected events with the @xmath36 final state is shown in fig.[fig : mxn ] , where a clear peak at the neutron mass is seen .",
    "for further analysis events within @xmath37 of the neutron peak were kept .",
    "background contributions due to particle misidentification are estimated at about @xmath38 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : mxn ] shows the @xmath35 distribution of events with a tighter cut on the vertex time for kaons .",
    "both kaons were required to be within @xmath39  nsec of the proton vertex time .",
    "practically no background remains under the neutron peak in this case .",
    "there are several known reactions , such as photoproduction of mesons ( that decay into @xmath40 ) or excited hyperons ( that decay into a @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) , that contribute to the same final state .",
    "the @xmath43 meson at @xmath44 gev@xmath9 , and the @xmath45(1520 ) at @xmath46 gev@xmath9 are cleanly seen in our event sample .",
    "events from these resonances have been removed from the final sample .",
    "two other event selection requirements are applied , based on kinematics .",
    "first , the missing momentum of the undetected neutron must be greater than 80 mev / c .",
    "for momenta below this value , the neutron is likely a spectator to other reaction mechanisms .",
    "our studies show that increasing the value of this cutoff does not change the final results  in particular it does not eliminate the peak shown below  but does reduce the statistics in the @xmath34 spectrum .",
    "second , events with @xmath32 momentum greater than 1.0  gev / c were removed .",
    "this cutoff is based on monte carlo simulations of the @xmath1 decay from an event distribution uniform in phase space , which show that the @xmath32 momentum rarely exceeds 1.0 gev / c .",
    "the data also show that @xmath32 momenta greater than 1.0 gev / c are associated with an invariant mass of the @xmath5 system , @xmath34 , above @xmath47 gev / c@xmath48 .",
    "the second requirement reduces this background .",
    "the final @xmath34 spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] , along with a fit to the peak at 1.542 gev@xmath9 and a gaussian plus constant term fit to the background .",
    "the panel on the left shows the distribution for all selected events .",
    "the spectrum of events removed by the @xmath45(1520 ) cut is shown in the dotted histogram , and does not appear to be associated with the peak at 1.542 gev@xmath9 .",
    "the fit gives a gaussian width for the peak consistent with the instrumental resolution of 21 mev@xmath9 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the statistical significance of this peak is estimated to be @xmath49 , based on fluctuations of the background over a window of 36 mev / c@xmath48 centered on the peak .",
    "different assumptions for the background shape lead to an additional uncertainty in the statistical significance , which is estimated at @xmath50 .",
    "the panel on the right in fig.[fig : final ] corresponds to events with a tight timing cut on the kaon vertex time .",
    "the signal at @xmath23 gev@xmath9 is clearly seen with a smaller number of events , and somewhat reduced significance .",
    "this result has since been submitted for publication in phys .",
    "lett . @xcite .",
    "in this analysis the reaction @xmath51 was studied .",
    "possible diagrams contributing to the photoproduction of the @xmath1 from the proton are presented in fig .",
    "[ gamma_p ] .",
    "an estimate of the cross section for @xmath1 production in the reaction @xmath52 was made by m.  polyakov @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53 distribution ( @xmath54 is the angle between the @xmath55 momentum and photon beam in the center of mass system ) peaks in the forward direction ( small @xmath56 region ) , as expected for the @xmath56-channel exchange mechanism ( see fig.[gamma_p ] ) . about 80% of the events lie in the region with @xmath57 ( for a photon energy at 4  gev ) , which appears to be a natural cut for the extraction of the @xmath1 signal from a proton target .",
    "this important feature of the cross section can be used for the signal selection and the background reduction in photoproduction reactions .",
    "the reaction @xmath4 was studied at jefferson lab with photon energy from 3 to 5.25  gev using an energy tagged photon beam .",
    "the final state particles , @xmath58 and @xmath32 , were detected in the clas detector@xcite , and the neutron was identified using the missing mass technique .",
    "there are 13.6k events , each having a positive pion and two kaons of opposite sign in the final state , which were selected for the analysis of the reaction @xmath59 . the missing mass distribution for the reaction @xmath60 is shown in fig.[neutron ] .",
    "a neutron peak is clearly seen in this distribution .",
    "there is a 27% background under the peak .",
    "the arrows indicate the @xmath61 cut for the neutron selection .",
    "there are about 40 @xmath43 mesons in the selected sample .",
    "a cut on the @xmath62 invariant mass with @xmath63  gev / c@xmath48 was applied to remove @xmath43 mesons .",
    "the @xmath64 invariant mass spectrum of the remaining 3699 events is presented in fig.[theta ] .    to suppress background and extract the signal for the @xmath1 photoproduction",
    ", we used the general properties of the production mechanism of @xmath1 from a proton target ( see fig.[gamma_p ] ) . in the tree diagrams the @xmath65 system moves along the photon beam in the center of mass system and @xmath5 moves in the opposite direction . in order to select the @xmath56-channel process illustrated in fig.[gamma_p ] ,",
    "only events with @xmath57 were taken for further analysis .",
    "since we want to retain both the resonance @xmath66 production and non - resonance @xmath65 continuum no cuts on @xmath67 were applied .",
    "fig.[theta ] ( the right panel ) presents the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum of the events with @xmath68 .",
    "this distribution was fitted by a gaussian function and a smooth background .",
    "as suggested by data from this experiment the shape of the @xmath5 invariant mass distribution in the reaction @xmath59 does not change significantly as a function of the @xmath54 angle .",
    "for this reason the shape of the background was obtained from the full data set of the events ( left panel in fig.[theta ] ) .",
    "the resulting fit yields 27 counts in the peak with the mass @xmath69  gev / c@xmath48 and width @xmath70 mev / c@xmath48 . the mass scale uncertainty is estimated as @xmath71 mev / c@xmath48 .",
    "this uncertainty is mainly due to the energy calibration of the clas detector and the electron accelerator .",
    "the statistical significance of this peak is @xmath72 calculated over a window of 80  mev / c@xmath48 .",
    "the mass resolution is close to the experimental resolution of clas .    as a check ,",
    "a side band subtraction was carried out using events from the neutron peak ( @xmath73 and background events left and right of the neutron peak .",
    "no resonance structures were found in the side band distribution and the peak parameters of the fit did not change after the side band subtraction .",
    "analyses of clas photoproduction data firmly establish the existence of a narrow @xmath0 exotic baryon in the @xmath5 system with a mass approximately at @xmath74 gev@xmath9 .",
    "the statistical significance of the peak in the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath5 is @xmath75 for the analysis of the reaction @xmath51 , and is @xmath76 for the analysis of the reaction @xmath3 .",
    "these results are consistent with the @xmath0 state reported by leps and diana collaborations , and with the @xmath77-quark ( @xmath78 ) baryon predicted in the chiral soliton model .",
