    "the local universe provides ample evidence for the existence of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) in the centers of most galaxies .",
    "typical masses are in the range @xmath16 , with few exceptionally massive objects reaching @xmath17 .",
    "as first argued by soltan ( 1982 ) , the total local bh mass is consistent with the total radiation emitted by accreting smbhs in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the accumulation of mass onto smbhs can be traced back through cosmic history by analyzing the redshift - dependent quasar luminosity function .",
    "such studies suggest that the peak epoch of smbh growth was at @xmath18 ( e.g. , miyaji et al .",
    "2001 ; hasinger et al .  2005 ; silverman et al .  2008 ; croom et al .",
    "however , this statistical approach does not provide sufficient information about the mass of individual smbhs at various redshifts .",
    "a more detailed evolutionary study requires such measurements , in combination with a reliable estimate of the bolometric luminosity ( l_bol @xmath19 ) and hence the light - to - mass ratio or , equivalently , the normalized accretion rate @xmath20 .",
    "several recent studies suggest that the more massive bhs experience most of their growth at very early epochs ( @xmath21 ) , while those observed as agns in the the local universe tend to have lower m_bh @xmath3  ( `` downsizing '' ; e.g. , marconi et al .  2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "a similar effect is suggested for the distributions of l / l_edd @xmath4 , such that at @xmath22 most agns accrete close to their eddington limit ( merloni 2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "it is also predicted that there should be an anticorrelation between m_bh @xmath3  and l / l_edd @xmath4  at all redshifts .",
    "these trends are in general agreement with observations ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2004 ; netzer & trakhtenbrot 2007 ; shen et al .",
    "2008 ) . detailed simulations of galaxy mergers predict that the instantaneous agn luminosity and smbh accretion rate vary greatly on very short timescales ( di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al .  2006 ; sijacki et al .",
    "the overall bh accretion period following major mergers lasts @xmath23 , out of which the central source would appear as a luminous , unobscured agn for at most a @xmath24 .",
    "m_bh @xmath3  may grow by as much as a factor @xmath25 during such mergers .",
    "the merger history of smbh hosts can also be traced in cosmological simulations of structure formation , by following halo merger trees ( e.g. , volonteri et 2003 ) .",
    "almost all these models require ( or assume ) that at @xmath21 most agn would accrete close to , or indeed at their eddington limit .",
    "the fast growth has to last almost continuously from very early epochs ( @xmath26 ) and involve massive seed bhs ( @xmath27 ) , to account for the very massive bhs detected at @xmath28 ( e.g. , fan et al .",

    "2010a ; bonoli et al .",
    "these studies use various prescriptions to link agns with their dark matter halos . at lower redshifts ( i.e. @xmath31 )",
    ", the accretion can be more episodic with a typical duty cycle between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; merloni 2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "2009 ) a comprehensive , up - to - date review of many of these issues is given in shankar ( 2009 ) .    in order to test these scenarios ,",
    "m_bh @xmath3  and l / l_edd @xmath4  ought to be measured in large , representative samples . for unobscured , type - i agns , this is usually achieved by using `` single epoch '' ( or `` virial '' ) m_bh @xmath3  determination methods , which are based on the results of long - term reverberation mapping campaigns .",
    "these methods are based on estimating the size of the broad line region ( blr ) and involve an empirical relation of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the monochromatic luminosity in a certain waveband . combining @xmath36 with the assumption of virialized motion of the blr gas , we get @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a geometrical factor of order unity ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ; bentz et al .",
    "the effect of radiation pressure force on such estimates is still a matter of some discussion ( marconi et al .",
    "2008 ) , but recent work suggests it is not very important ( netzer 2009a ; netzer & marziani 2010 ) .",
    "single epoch mass estimate methods based on the h@xmath39  and ii2798 mgii@xmath2  lines ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "2005 and mclure & dunlop 2004 , respectively ) were used to estimate m_bh",

    "; willott et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter w10 ) .",
    "m_bh @xmath3  can also be estimated from the broad iv1549 civ@xmath42  line , using specifically calibrated relations ( e.g. , vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) .",
    "this would potentially enable the study of large samples of agn at high redshifts .",
    "however , there is clear evidence that iv civ - based estimates of m_bh @xmath3  are unreliable .",
    "baskin & laor ( 2005 ) found that the iv civ  line is often blue - shifted with respect to the agn rest - frame , which suggests that the dynamics of the iv civ - emitting gas may be dominated by non - virial motion .",
    "several studies of large samples clearly demonstrate that the relation between the widths of the iv civ  line and of the lower ionization lines ( h@xmath39  and mgii ) is weak and shows considerable scatter ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2008 ; fine et al .",
    "2010 ) that is inconsistent with the virial assumption used in such mass estimators .",
    "finally , our own study ( n07 ) of luminous @xmath11 and @xmath12  agns shows a complete lack of correlation between iv civ - based and h@xmath39-based estimates of m_bh @xmath3 .",
    "these discrepancies become crucial at high redshifts and large m_bh @xmath3  and lead to the conclusion that only h@xmath39-based and mgii - based mass estimates are reliable enough to infer the properties of such sources .",
    "our previous project ( s04 & n07 ) presented the largest sample of @xmath11 and @xmath12  type - i agns for which m_bh @xmath3  and l / l_edd @xmath4  were reliably measured using nir h@xmath39  spectroscopy .",
    "the distribution of l / l_edd @xmath4  at @xmath11 and @xmath12  was found to be broad , and about half of the sources had @xmath43 , inconsistent with several of the models mentioned above .",
    "in particular , the typically low accretion rates and the very high masses ( up to @xmath44 ) also mean that @xmath45 of the sources did not have enough time to grow to the observed m_bh @xmath3  by continuous accretion at the observed rates .",
    "these findings suggest that an epoch of faster smbh growth must have occurred , for most objects , at @xmath46 . in order to probe such redshifts ,",
    "the mgii  line must be observed in either the @xmath47 or the @xmath48-bands .",
    "practically , this corresponds to focusing on z4.8 @xmath0  or @xmath49  sources .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic study of m_bh @xmath3  and l / l_edd @xmath4  in a large , well - defined sample of z4.8 @xmath0  type - i agns .",
    "this is based on new _",
    "h_-band  spectroscopic observations , which enable the measurement of the mgii  line .",

    "aperture photometry was performed over the science targets and the several visible 2mass stars in each field . whenever possible , we used only stars with best - quality 2mass photometry for the relative scaling of the science target fluxes .",
    "the magnitudes thus obtained are also listed in table  [ tab : obs_log ] , for the relevant sources .",
    "since the spectroscopy and imaging observations were not simultaneous , there exists a real uncertainty regarding possible flux variability of our z4.8 @xmath0  sources .",
    "our targets are relatively luminous , and thus are not expected to have large variability amplitudes ( e.g. bauer et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "we compared the photometric and the spectroscopic fluxes , achieved by synthetic photometry of the sinfoni & niri spectra .",
    "the median discrepancy is @xmath95 mags , in the sense that the ( later observed ) photometric fluxes are on average fainter than the spectroscopy - deduced fluxes .",
    "the standard deviation is close to 0.2 mags .",
    "photometric fluxes for 10  additional sources were obtained through the fourth data release of the ukirt infrared digital sky survey ( ukidss / dr4 ; lawrence et al .",
    "the photometry of these sources is also consistent with the fluxes deduced from our spectrophotometric calibration .",
    "excluding one significant outlier ( j0210 - 0018 ) , the mean deviation between the two methods is , again , close to 0.2 mags .    with this evidence of little flux variation , and reliable spectrophotometry for a large fraction ( @xmath96 ) of arbitrary selected sources ,",
    "we conclude that the accuracy of our spectrophotometric flux calibration is high , with uncertainties of about @xmath97 . in order to correctly probe the instantaneous emission from the sources ,",
    "we thus adopt the spectrophotometric fluxes to measure luminosities , even for those sources which were photometrically observed .",
    "the full set of calibrated spectra is presented in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "to determine m_bh @xmath3  and l / l_edd @xmath4  we fit the observed spectra with a model which combines a continuum component , feiiand feiii  lines , and the two doublet mgii  lines . the procedure used here is similar to the one presented in several other studies ( e.g. shen et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "it is based on a new code that was developed and extensively tested on a large sample of @xmath98 sdss type - i agns , and will be described in detail in a future publication ( trakhtenbrot et al .",
    "in particular , this large sample was used to verify that important quantities such as narrow emission lines and bolometric corrections , are consistent with those derived from the well - studied h@xmath39 - 5007 @xmath99  emission region ( rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath100 ) .",
    "this was done using a sub - sample of @xmath101 sources at @xmath102 , where the sdss spectra show both the h@xmath39  and mgii  lines .",
    "the fitting of the z4.8 @xmath0  agns was preformed individually , verifying a satisfactory match between the data and the model . as a first step ,",
    "a linear pseudo - continuum is fit to the flux around 2655 and 3020 .",
    "next , we fit the feii  and feiii  emission complexes redward and blueward of mgii .",
    "for this we use a template made of the composite prepared by vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) that was supplemented by several predicted feii  lines ( kindly provided by g.  ferland ) .",
    "these are mainly feii  emission lines which coincide in wavelength with the mgii  line , where the observationally - based template of vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) is incomplete .",
    "this part of the template is very similar to the models presented in sigut & pradhan ( 2003 ; their fig .  13 ) and in baldwin et al .",
    "( 2004 ; their fig .  5 )",
    ". in both cases , the feii  flux under the mgii  line is dominated by the red extension of the @xmath103  emission complex .",
    "the additional feii  flux tends to flatten in sources with very broad lines , but the overall effect on the mgii  line fitting is very small .",
    "we consider this template to be more reliable than the addition of constant flux under the mgii  line , adopted by kurk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and fine et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . several other studies , such as salviander et al .  ( 2007 ) and shen et al .  ( 2008 ) , use templates very similar to ours , following the models in sigut & pradhan ( 2003 ) .",
    "our basic iron template is based on a single line profile with @xmath104 . to account for the range of observed line widths",
    ", we created a grid of broadended fe templates , by convolving the basic template with single gaussian profiles of varying width , ranging from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "we note that the templates that correspond to @xmath107 lack almost any distinguishable emission features .",
    "the grid of broadened fe templates is fitted to the continuum - subtracted spectra over the rest - frame wavelength regions of @xmath108  and @xmath109 , and the best - fit template is chosen by standard @xmath110 minimization .",
    "we allow the fe template to be shifted with respect to the systemic redshift and for its width to differ from that of the mgii  line .",
    "after the subtraction of the best - fit fe template , the pseudo - continuum is re - fitted and we iterate the fe - fitting process once again .",
    "this is done to ensure the convergence of the best - fit pseudo - continuum and fe lines .",
    "the final measure of the pseudo - continuum flux , f_(3000 ) @xmath111 , provides the continuum luminosity l_3000 @xmath92  which is further used to calculate m_bh @xmath3  and l / l_edd @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to note that the l_3000 @xmath92  thus obtained is _ not _ the intrinsic , underlying agn continuum since it also includes a contribution from the balmer continuum emission , that is not accounted for by the fitting procedure .",
    "once the pseudo - continuum and fe contributions are subtracted , we fit the mgii  line itself .",
    "the model for the line consists of 3 gaussians , two broad and one narrow component for each of the mgii  doublet lines .",
    "the intensity ratio of the doublet components is fixed to 1:1 , suitable for optically - thick lines .",
    "the broad components are limited to line widths in the range @xmath112 , while the width of the narrow components is bound to @xmath113 .",
    "although the relative contribution of the narrow components is very small ( @xmath114 ) , the procedure reproduces well the nlr width .",
    "this was verified by comparing the nlr fwhm  resulting from the ( separate ) mgii  and h@xmath39  fitting for the test sample of @xmath101 sources at @xmath102 mentioned above .",
    "we have also included a single absorption feature ( also a gaussian ) to account for the frequent appearance of blue - shifted mgii  troughs .",
    "the best - fit model is used to measure the fwhm of the total broad _ single _",
    "mgii  line and the total luminosity of both mgii  components .",
    "we stress that in earlier studies , the line width was calculated using the combined doublet profile , which has implications to the deduced m_bh @xmath3  ( see   [ sec_sub : dis_compare ] ) .",
    "the best - fit continuum and mgii  line parameters are given in table  [ tab : line_pars ] .",
    "the uncertainties that also appear in table  [ tab : line_pars ] reflect the true uncertainties associated with the spectroscopic reduction and line - fitting procedure .",
    "these were estimated from varying several of the parameters involved in these processes and examining the range of possible outcomes .",
    "we consider these uncertainties to be much more realistic than those derived solely from the flux noise .",

    "for the minority the sources , those with small l / l_edd @xmath4 , there might have been an ever earlier epoch of faster accretion or , perhaps , they started their growth from a much larger seeds ( @xmath237 ) .",

    "a comparison of the observed distributions of m_bh @xmath3  at z4.8 @xmath0 , @xmath14  and @xmath15  indicates that the z4.8 @xmath0  sources either completely stop their accretion shortly after z4.8 @xmath0 , or that their accretion proceeds in relatively short episodes .",
    "we find that for mass growth rates that follow either constant l / l_edd @xmath4  or constant l_bol @xmath19  scenarios , duty cycles of either @xmath170 or @xmath167 , respectively , give reasonable agreement to the observed distributions of m_bh @xmath3 .",
