    "thus , no dynamic picture will be accessible easily , rather a time - averaged image can be generated .",
    "this has already been studied by means of simulations by @xcite .",
    "generally , enhanced opacity at longer wavelengths smoothes out the strong features in the light curves and centroid tracks expected in the nir .",
    "several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of the flares from the gc .",
    "the most common ones can be summarized as follows :    * star - disk interactions rather far away from the black hole ( @xmath53@xmath54 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; * synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated in the central part ( @xmath55 ) , through processes such as turbulent acceleration , reconnections , and weak shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; * sudden heating of hot electrons ( e.g.   by magnetic reconnection ) in a permanent jet @xcite ; * increase in the accretion rate due to the infall of a clump of material , being rapidly driven inwards due to a rossby wave instability ( rwi ) @xcite .",
    "the star - disk interaction model appears unlikely .",
    "it is unable to explain either the observed synchrotron emission or the quasi - periodic signal on a timescale of minutes .",
    "moreover , actual constraints on sgr  a * s disk size in the radio ( @xmath56 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are in conflict with the assumption of stars remaining stable on such close orbits .",
    "no matter what the emission process producing the flares is , the matter responsible for it must move with at least the order of the keplerian circular velocity @xmath57 this is true irrespective of whether this matter is orbiting the black hole , falling into it in free fall , or escaping in a jet or wind .",
    "given that @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , this matter moves by several times the proposed accuracy ( @xmath12  @xmath1 ) during one flare .",
    "this typical velocity is large compared to the apparent velocity of the star proposed as interferometric phase reference .",
    "if the flares are due to magnetic reconnection in a jet ( scenario c ) , sufficiently high above the accretion disk , the electrons responsible for the emission would have relativistic velocities , but the emission region may not move at the same speed .",
    "this region is tied to the node in the magnetic field where the reconnection happens . if this node drifts on the hour timescale , some long term proper motion could be observed . in this scenario ,",
    "the short - term variability in the lightcurves could come from individual blobs of denser material being ejected at a pseudo - frequency , typical for the dynamical timescale of the inner disk .",
    "when passing through the node at a significant fraction of @xmath60as  min@xmath61 , a short term proper motion could be expected from these individual blobs .    however , the observational data at hand ( see * ? ? ? * for a summary ) strongly favor another interpretation , namely the emission of synchrotron radiation from matter orbiting the black hole near its isco .",
    "this matter would be confined to a small region in the disk ( @xmath62 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) containing highly accelerated electrons in a broken power - law distribution ( @xmath63 in the nir , * ? ? ?",
    "such a radiating blob could be produced by scenario b. despite the very high velocity of the material ( about half the speed of light ) , no long - term proper motion would be detected at the scale of more than one orbital period .",
    "nevertheless , this scenario opens up extremely interesting scientific perspectives .",
    "time - resolved astrometry of the flares would allow the shape of the isco to be traced , lensed by the strong gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "this would give access to the orientation of the orbit as well as other physical parameters of the model , and more fundamentally provide a probe for the strong gravitational field of a black hole .",
    "this scenario is akin to the rwi scenario ( scenario d ) . in both cases ,",
    "the emission originates very close to the black hole , within a few schwarzschild radii @xcite .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference : instead of a blob , scenario d produces a somewhat symmetrical spiral structure @xcite .",
    "it is created by a rwi in the accreting plasma producing quasi - periodic oscillations in the accretion rate which are close to the orbital period .",
    "though , these oscillations are not of keplerian origin and therefore do not allow the black hole spin to be constrained from the periodic timescale .",
    "they are caused by a pattern rotation in the disk , a wave phenomenon .",
    "further studies are needed to assess whether this process could mimic the observed light curves and whether it could lead to an observable astrometric signature .",
    "we will hereafter always assume that flares from sgr  a * are due to matter on keplerian orbits around the black hole and that the periods observed in the light curves are a signature of these orbits .",
    "after a discussion of our basic methods we will first investigate the consequences of this scenario on the basis of a simplified model .",
    "therefore , we study the appearance of emission from a small sphere on the co - rotating isco about a kerr black hole and generate photometric , astrometric as well as polarimetric data .",
    "we will then address an advanced model with an extended emission region as a phenomenological model for a variable source .",
    "the lensing effects in the strong gravitational field of a black hole and the optical appearance of accretion disks and close - by objects have been computed a number of times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "derivations of analytical lens - equations , giving both the position of multiple images of a source and the time of arrival of each of these images have also been attempted .",
    "these purely analytical studies are however limited in the computation of higher order images ( no more than second order ) and do not account for extended sources with variable intrinsic brightness .",
    "the apparent path on sky of a particle revolving around a black hole in a circular orbit of radius @xmath22 ( @xmath64 for the isco of a schwarzschild black hole ) does not have the shape of an ellipse due to strong deflection of light rays by the gravitational field . observed in high inclination ,",
    "the orbit s near side appears as half - ellipse ( the usual appearance of an inclined circle ) , whereas the far side is de - projected and closely resembles a semi - circle .",
    "in addition , light rays emitted by a nearby source are bent so strongly that this source appears at several different locations on sky . in principle , infinitely many such images emerge .",
    "however , higher order images are exponentially suppressed in angular diameter and have increasingly longer light travel times compared to the primary image ( see fig .  [ mult_images ] ) . moreover , absorption increasingly diminishes the brightness of images with longer light paths .      unlike the newtonian case , in both schwarzschild and kerr geometry bound orbits are not closed in general .",
    "eccentric orbits in the schwarzschild metric or in the equatorial plane of the kerr metric are planar , but not closed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to lense - thirring precession",
    ", circular orbits outside this equatorial plane are not planar and can be described as helices @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a cloud falling onto the black hole on a trajectory inclined with respect to the equatorial plane would soon form a geometrically thick disk , symmetrical with respect to the equatorial plane , and settle on this plane to be circularized . in the following",
    "we will therefore concentrate on circular orbits in the equatorial plane .",
    "the power law sed observed in the gc - flares with a red spectral index in the nir @xcite supports synchrotron emission .",
    "this indicates the phenomenon to be dictated by a strong magnetic field .",
    "possible configurations of such magnetic fields are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the field lines should intersect the accretion disk orthogonally at its surface .",
    "we will therefore consider the field to be poloidal near the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic field inside the accretion disk is likely frozen .",
    "the field lines must warp and align with the velocity field , leading to a toroidal geometry inside .",
    "shear tends to make the magnetic field lines loop around the black hole , leading to magnetic reconnection events .",
    "the stronger shear near the inner edge of the disk causes more reconnection events towards this edge . we will consider a bright sphere close to the isco , which should be a good approximation for the inner edge of the quasi - circular accretion disk .",
    "the sphere is just a first approximation of the emitting region geometry .",
    "its real shape presumably follows the field lines and would therefore extend as an arc along the orbit .",
    "we choose to use relativistic ray tracing to model the light bending effects @xcite .",
    "light rays are represented by null geodesics which are determined by integrating the equation of motion for photons in kerr spacetime .",
    "initial values for this ordinary differential equation are determined by the position , orientation , and field of view of the observer s camera and by the coordinates of the corresponding pixel in the image plane .",
    "starting from the observer , the geodesics have to be integrated back in time until they fulfill one of the breaking conditions : they either reach the surface of the source ( as in fig .",
    "[ mult_images ] ) , they cross the horizon of the black hole , or they leave a certain bounding box around the region of consideration . a further limit is given by a maximum length for any computed geodesic .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it does not yield any analytical approximation , it is exact up to the numerical precision .",
    "the fact that different null geodesics do not affect each other allows the code to be parallelized , i.e.  the field of view can be divided into smaller sections to be computed on several cpus and reassembled later on .",
    "we set up a very simplified configuration of a nonrotating sphere of radius @xmath65 on a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a kerr black hole .",
    "the sphere s surface is homogeneous and emits light isotropically . from the ray tracing code",
    "we compute the lensed images of the source ( we typically resolve images up to the fourth order ) with the corresponding light travel times @xmath66 and frequency shifts @xmath67 computed for each pixel ( ` obs ' for observed and ` em ' for emitted ) .",
    "in addition , the code provides us with the local tetrad @xmath68 of the observer , parallel transported to the source in each pixel .",
    "it is necessary for the polarimetric analysis of the flare model .",
    "the main restriction to the ray tracing method is a tradeoff between resolution and computing time . in order to keep the computing time manageable",
    ", we had to consider frames with no more than @xmath69 pixels .",
    "in addition to this , again for the sake of reasonable computing time , it has been necessary to use a finite distance between the observer and the black hole ( @xmath70 )",
    ". however , this yields a good enough approximation , since we are able to resolve all multiple images up to the third order .    for our simulations we set up a grid of four inclinations ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath38 , @xmath73 ) , four orbital radii ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) and four black hole spin - parameters ( @xmath27 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "all possible combinations yield a grid of @xmath81 different setups , allowing to analyze the impact of these parameters . for each configuration",
    "we ray traced one complete orbit , consisting of roughly @xmath2@xmath82 frames depending on the orbital period of the source ( for the @xmath83 case only two simulations with @xmath84 were carried out ) .      assuming the source to emit a power law sed in its rest frame in the nir , @xmath85 with spectral index @xmath86 , we can compute the apparent surface brightness @xmath87 ( as seen by a distant observer ) from the frequency maps provided by the ray tracing code . we simply have to apply liouville s theorem @xcite , stating : @xmath88 for the apparent surface brightness this yields @xmath89 depending on the generalized redshift factor @xmath90 , which is responsible for relativistic beaming- and doppler effects , as well as gravitational redshift .",
    "the result is that the source appears brighter and blueshifted on the approaching side , respectively fainter and redshifted on the receding side .",
    "we are not interested in the absolute value of @xmath91 , since we do not model the emission process in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we only study the dependencies of the simulated light curves on the various parameters of the model .",
    "light curves are created by integrating the apparent surface brightness over a certain frequency range and over the field  of  view : @xmath92 thus , every simulated frame produces one data point of the light curve .",
    "we normalize each light curve by its minimum flux and plot its magnitude ( @xmath93 ) against the orbital phase  @xmath94 in radians ( @xmath95 designates the point where the hot spot appears closest to the observer ) .",
    "similarly , the centroid of emission is computed as @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the vector from the origin ( center of field of view ) to the pixel position .",
    "the centroid track is generated by plotting @xmath98 for every frame .",
    "we always use the mass and distance of sgr  a * for the scaling of its apparent size ( @xmath99 corresponds to about @xmath100as ) .",
    "first we study the observable properties of a constantly radiating sphere of radius @xmath65 and spectral index @xmath101 on a co - rotating circular orbit around a generally rotating black hole .",
    "the sense of rotation of the black hole ( and thus the direction of rotation of the source ) is arbitrarily chosen to be counterclockwise .",

    "[ radii_incl_s0 ] displays light curves and centroid tracks of this model for different orbital radii and inclinations of the hot spot . decreasing the orbital radius generally leads to narrower , higher peaks in the light curves .",
    "this is due to the increasing spot - velocity leading to stronger relativistic doppler- and beaming effects .",
    "the same changes can be produced by increasing the inclination of the orbit , since this increases the line of sight velocity of the hot spot . in our chosen parameter range , changes in the inclination exhibit these relativistic effects more strongly than changes in the orbital radius .",
    "the light curves in @xmath73 inclination reveal an additional feature : before each of them reaches its usual peak - maximum ( approaching node ) , a spiky second peak appears .",
    "its peak - flux exceeds the usual maximum by far .",
    "it originates from the development of an _ einstein ring _ , an apparent ring - shaped image of the hot spot with the black hole in its center .",
    "it occurs when the light source , the black hole and the observer are aligned ( and the black hole is in between ) . due to the finite extension of the source , conditions for an einstein ring",
    "are fulfilled in a finite ( although small ) range of inclinations .",
    "thus , it is no mathematical artifact of the exact @xmath73-case .",
    "higher order einstein rings appear , when light rays revolve the black hole .",
    "for instance , a secondary einstein ring appears when the hot spot passes in front of the black hole ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "we then receive photons from the far side of the spot , which have orbited the black hole once .",
    "in fact it occurs a bit later , since one has to consider the finite speed of the photons when orbiting the black hole .",
    "the corresponding peaks can also be seen in the @xmath73-plot ( at @xmath102 ) , although they are a lot fainter than the ones caused by the primary einstein ring .    at lower inclinations",
    "we no longer expect einstein rings , but still multiple images of the hot spot .",
    "obviously , their effects on the light curves are marginal .",
    "only the light curves with @xmath38 inclination show a slight distortion of the main peak , suggesting the existence of a secondary image .",
    "it is not only its small apparent size that prevents the secondary image from being observable in the light curves , but also the fact that its brightness is not as variable as that of the einstein ring .    turning to astrometry",
    ", decreasing the orbital radius obviously leads to smaller centroid tracks .",
    "then , as with the light curves , the relativistic effects increase , i.e.  the deviation of the centroid tracks from the newtonian case ( projected circles ) becomes more significant . on the one hand , this deviation is caused by multiple images of the hot spot .",
    "when the secondary image gets brightest , the centroid of the received light lies somewhere in between the primary and the secondary image .",
    "but since the latter only brightens for a short time ( it moves faster on the approaching side ) , this causes a cusp in the centroid track . on the other hand , deflections of the primary rays",
    "result in a further distortion of the centroid track .",
    "the rear part of the orbit appears to be folded upwards at higher inclinations .",
    "again , raising the inclination leads to stronger relativistic effects .",
    "the cusp in the centroid track , for instance , becomes more and more prominent .",
    "as shown in the lower right plot of fig .",
    "[ radii_incl_s0 ] , the classical sine - pattern of the @xmath73-case is deformed .",
    "it is stretched when the source is receding and compressed when approaching ( due to the finite propagation speed of the emitted light rays ) .",
    "in addition , distinct spikes appear in the pattern .",
    "these can again be associated with the einstein  rings . comparing the occurrence of these spikes with the occurrence of the sub - peaks in the light curves",
    ", one can ascertain that they appear at the same orbital phase .",
    "[ [ spectral - index ] ] spectral index + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    changing the sed of the hot spot emission has strong implications for the light curves as well .",
    "since we are observing in a confined range of frequencies ( observing band ) , doppler shifting the emitted radiation makes us observe different parts of the sed every instant of time .",
    "if , for instance , the hot spot is approaching us , the observed radiation is blue - shifted . depending upon whether the hot spot emission follows a blue , white or red sed , the observed flux is lower , equal or higher , respectively",
    "this means that a red sed ( @xmath103 ) amplifies the beaming effect by brightening the hot spot on the approaching side and dimming it on the receding side , while a source with a blue sed ( @xmath104 ) behaves contrariwise . for a white sed ( @xmath101 )",
    "the doppler shift does not change the observed flux at all .",
    "[ sed ] displays light curves and centroid tracks for all three cases",
    ". clearly , the light curve peaks rise with decreasing spectral index . in the case of a blue",
    "sed the observed flux of the hot spot at the approaching side is diminished to such an extent that the secondary image of the blob is revealed .",
    "its brightness exceeds the total flux of the primary image for a short fraction of the orbital period . in the case of a red",
    "sed the opposite happens : the primary peak gets so narrow and bright that the secondary peak appears slightly before the hot spot reaches the approaching node .    for the centroid tracks",
    ", it appears that those with a red spectrum are dragged towards the approaching side , whereas those with a blue spectrum are more centered towards the receding side .",
    "the multiple images have a greater influence in the case of a red sed , since the primary image of the hot spot is dimmed more strongly on the receding side of the orbit , whereas the secondary image is amplified more strongly on the approaching side .",
    "this even makes the cusp from the secondary image turn into a loop ; the tertiary image may create another cusp .",

    "this is due to the fact that we specify the orbital radius in units of the isco , which shrinks with higher black hole spin ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 for @xmath27 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , respectively ) . by looking more closely at the einstein ring peaks in the @xmath73-light curves",
    ", one can find a slight broadening with higher spin .",
    "this is because the source occupies a bigger fraction of the orbit at smaller radii .",
    "the result is that the required conditions for an einstein ring are met for a larger orbital phase ( this can already be seen in fig .  [ radii_incl_s0 ] ) . in the high spin case ( @xmath83 ) the shape of the light curves",
    "is dominated by multiple images .    with higher spin - parameters",
    "the centroid tracks show even greater deformation , i.e.  the cusp is enhanced and the rear part of the track is dragged up further . in addition , a second cusp emerges on the receding side , due to the tertiary image of the spot .",
    "the cusps may again turn into loops provided the multiple images are bright enough .",
    "the lower right plot in fig .",
    "[ spin ] shows the @xmath73-case .",
    "just like the sub - peaks in the light curves , the spikes in the deformed sine - pattern are broadened with higher spin - parameters of the black hole . in the high spin case ,",
    "einstein rings dominate throughout the entire orbital motion .",
    "thereby the motion of the hot spot is almost completely shrouded .    aside from its influence on the radius of the isco , the black hole spin has only marginal impact on either the shape of light curves and centroid tracks ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason it is presumably impossible to deduce the spin - parameter from the light curves alone .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gravity ] , where we compare the maximum - to - minimum flux - amplification in the light curves with the maximum horizontal deflection of the centroid tracks for each grid - configuration .",
    "obviously , in such a representation it is possible to distinguish every single configuration by the set of parameters @xmath111 .",
    "this is because the inclination mainly influences the light curve peaks and does not change the horizontal centroid deflection that much , whereas the orbital radius has a stronger influence on the centroid deflection than on the light curves .",
    "changing the spin - parameter of the black hole has no big effect on the location of a configuration with given orbital radius in this plot .",
    "configurations with identical locations ( i.e.  same orbital radius and inclination ) can be distinguished by their orbital period @xmath112 , which is known from the light curves . with this",

    "( [ eq : period ] ) .",
    "recent data show that the nir flare emission is polarized @xcite .",
    "it is not yet certain whether the magnetic field in the accretion disk is mostly poloidal or toroidal , but there is evidence both from simulations by @xcite and observations by @xcite in support of a toroidal configuration .",
    "assuming the magnetic field within the hot spot ( compact sphere ) to follow this geometry one can investigate the polarimetric properties ( temporal evolution of polarization fraction and angle ) of the rotating hot spot scenario .",
    "a detailed treatment was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they find that the polarized flux follows the evolution of the total flux with a short delay .",
    "additionally , small dips in the polarized flux light curve are produced by the multiple images of the source .",
    "the variation of the polarization angle is mainly influenced by the inclination of the hot spot orbit .",
    "within one orbital period it rotates continuously , but is punctuated by rapid rotations ( around @xmath73 ) at times where the dips in the polarized light curve appear . in case of an edge - on view , the angle remains mostly constant on account of axial symmetry , but the polarization fraction drops significantly during einstein ring events .",
    "@xcite used polarimetric data together with hot spot simulations to estimate the orientation of the sgr  a * system .",
    "they investigated two different magnetic field geometries ( sunspot - like and toroidal ) and derive the position angle of the sgr  a * equatorial plane normal to be between @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( east of north ) on a @xmath110 level .",
    "besides this , a high inclination angle of the hot spot orbit is favoured .    in the context of the vlti we also want to study the effect of polarization on the centroid motion of the flares .",
    "astrometric measurements using polarizing filters may help filter out physically different components of the emission region ( e.g.  sphere and arc , see section [ arc ] ) and thus increase the apparent proper motion of the single components . furthermore",
    ", the signatures of multiple images may be easier to detect , since they generally possess different polarization angles with respect to the primary image .",
    "to this end we have simulated centroid tracks produced by a small , constant source , observed through two perpendicular polarizing filters in the nir .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ polarimetry ] . the effect on",
    "the astrometry can be very important when the polarization fraction  @xmath115 of the source is high .",
    "the centroid tracks show pronounced features caused by the multiple images of the hot spot , especially when observed in the polarization component along the orbital line of nodes .",
    "however , most of the flux is blocked by the filter in this observing mode , as can be seen in the light curves .",
    "it only rises up shortly when the multiple images ( respectively einstein rings ) are amplified most strongly , causing the swing in the polarizing angle .",
    "thus , an auspicious observation of this kind might be hard to achieve .",
    "moreover , observational data support a rather low polarization fraction ( @xcite mostly see @xmath43@xmath36 ) . as apparent from fig .",
    "[ polarimetry ] , a polarization fraction of @xmath116 already reduces the polarimetric deviations from the common centroid tracks to less than the projected accuracy of order @xmath12  @xmath1 .",
    "the conception of a single compact object revolving on a close orbit about a supermassive black hole , maintaining a constant shape and brightness is somewhat artificial and has presumably little physical relevance . in order to improve this model",
    "we implement , in addition to the emitting sphere , an elongated arc that spreads from this sphere along the orbit .",
    "a similar model was already adopted by @xcite , it is mainly motivated by the broad shape of the observed light curve peaks from sgr  a*. by fitting their model to observed flare data they find a constant elongation of the arc troughout the flare .",
    "this can also be inferred from the fact that the width of the major peaks in the flare light curves does not change significantly during one flare .",
    "a steady broadening of the peaks , for instance , would indicate gravitational shear of the emitting region .",
    "however , this does not seem to happen given the data at hand .    the crucial assumption for considering gravitational shear is to neglect any bonding forces within the plasma around the black hole .",
    "however , a strong magnetic field is likely to be present and may prevent hot spots from being sheared on the keplerian timescale .",
    "the characteristic shear - time is then increasing with higher magnetic field strengths , due to a _ magneto - rotational instability _ ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "it acts against the tidal forces caused by the gravitational field and creates an attractive force among adjacent elements of the accretion disk , trying to enforce a rigid rotation .",
    "thus , in the case of a very strong magnetic field , the hot spot can be regarded as a rigid source , retaining its shape during the whole duration of a flare .",
    "we vary the intrinsic brightness of the two components ( sphere and arc ) with time to emulate heating and cooling sequences .",
    "we assume that the flares are due to a heating process ( e.g.  magnetic reconnection ) taking place in a small region of the inner disk .",
    "this heating process has its own lifecycle that can be described with a rise time and a decay time of each component .",
    "the timescales for these processes are determined by the synchrotron cooling time @xmath117 , which depends on the magnetic field strength @xmath118 and the wavelength @xmath119 of the observed synchrotron radiation . for the case of sgr",
    "a * it is estimated as @xcite : @xmath120 the magnetic field strengths predicted by radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) models for sgr  a * lie around @xmath121 , yielding cooling times that are less than the duration of a flare @xcite .",
    "computational models in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) suggest that in the close vicinity of a kerr black hole the magnetic field strength within the accretion disk decreases with radial distance .",
    "in contrast , higher spin - parameters lead to stronger magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these dependencies are fairly complicated and presumably can not be derived analytically .",
    "since a full grmhd simulation exceeds the scope of this work , we empirically determine the heating and cooling timescales from the observed light curves of sgr  a*.    it must also be mentioned that up to now , self - consistent grmhd simulations can only produce hot spots with very short life times , amounting to fractions of the orbital period ( @xmath122 ,   * ? ? ?",
    "hence , there have been attempts to explain the observed light curves with multi - spot models @xcite .",
    "several hot spots distributed radially around the black hole can produce similar quasi - periodic signals in the light curves as a single source .",
    "however , with the number of spots the flux amplification in the light curves and the deflection of the emission centroid is increasingly reduced .",
    "unknown mechanisms that may stabilize hot spots in the accretion flow may cause longer life times , though .",
    "we implement the arc by adding up all the sphere s ray traced images of one complete orbit .",
    "this results in a lensed ring around the black hole , including its multiple images .",
    "assigning a spatial and temporal brightness distribution to this ring allows us to simulate any desired hot spot .",
    "we use simple gaussian functions to describe the azimuthal brightness distribution of the arc and the temporal evolution of the entire hot spot .",
    "we leave the radial brightness distribution of the hot spot unaltered , i.e.  it remains confined to a radial region of @xmath123 diameter ( see fig . [ blob_arc_image ] ) .",
    "the spectral indices of sphere and arc remain to be specified .",
    "observations of the gc - flares suggest a connection between brightness and color @xcite .",
    "when the flare is dim it shows a red spectrum , whereas in bright states it is rather white . since in our model the sphere is brighter than the arc , motivated by the observations , we use @xmath124 and @xmath125 , thus covering the range of observed values @xcite .      in this section",
    "we fit the parameters of our hot spot model to observational data from sgr  a*. to this end a @xmath126-minimization is applied to fit the simulated light curves to the observed ones .",
    "however , for the fit of a flare light curve with a given periodicity we have to restrict ourselves to those model configurations with nearly the same orbital timescale .",
    "thus , only grid - configurations with fixed @xmath22 and @xmath24 can be considered and leave us with four different inclinations per fit ( our grid does not contain configurations with different values for @xmath22 and @xmath24 for a given orbital period ) .",
    "however , it is not the objective of this paper to estimate the spin - parameter of sgr  a * ( this has already been done by @xcite ) .",
    "we rather want to focus on the astrometric study of the hot spot model .",
    "hence , for the parameters describing the hot spot itself , we can calculate optimized values .",
    "we used photometric measurements of two bright gc - flares , namely the flare from april 4 and from july 22 , 2007 .",

    "the decay time of the hot spot is slightly larger than its rise time , because the light curve is more flattened on the decaying flank .",
    "the arc provides quite a strong contribution to the total flux : the surface brightness at its center is only four times less than the surface brightness of the sphere .",
    "it is spread along the orbit , possessing a full width at half maximum ( @xmath130 ) of more than one complete orbit .",

    "however , one has to be careful with drawing conclusions from this for the following reason : the arc - width @xmath136 and the inclination  @xmath137 are , to a certain extent , degenerate parameters that both determine the width and the height of the light curve peaks .",
    "nevertheless , the implementation of an extended arc is necessary in order to fit the broad light curve peaks in the flare .",
    "the inclination only moderatly influences the flare shape , by far weaker than the arc - width does .",
    "the fit worsens towards the wings of the flare . by checking the spacing between the major peaks one finds that the outer peaks do not match the @xmath20  min timescale as well as the inner ones .",
    "one could argue for either an acceleration or a deceleration of the orbital period , corresponding to shrinking or growing orbits , respectively .",
    "but , a close look at the spacing between the outer peaks does not support this reasoning , since their occurrence deviates from the orbital periodicity in both ways .",
    "higher inclinations produce sharper sub - peaks on top of the major peaks .",
    "these are generated by the compact sphere and reproduce some substructure in the observed flare quite well .",

    "having found a reasonable fit to the observed flare light curve it is of interest to extract its periodic properties by computing a power spectrum and comparing it to the one obtained from the experimental data . to this end",

    "the rise towards longer timescales is caused by the overall structure of the flare light curves , yielding a periodic timescale of the whole flare duration .",
    "higher frequencies , though , are suppressed in comparison to the observed data .",
    "this is due to the fact that the source as well as the observing instrument generate intrinsic noise .",
    "while the power spectral density ( psd ) of the instrumental noise is usually gaussian ( i.e.  constant ) , the one generated by the source may have a more complicated profile ( like a broken power law , for instance ) . in this case the overall power spectrum of the observed flare shows a slight rise to longer timescales .    in order to include the observational process into our simulations we artificially add random noise to our data .",
    "we can also mimic the flux - integration at the detector of the telescope by averaging over several successive data points .",

    "the fact that we add gaussian noise to the simulated data makes the power in this characteristic frequency decline .",

    "nevertheless , the impact of the arc - extension and the brightness - ratio between sphere and arc remains to be disentangled from the orbital parameters .",
    "future high quality polarimetric measurements could help in this respect .",
    "the centroid tracks from the best fit models are encouraging for future high resolution measurements .",
    "in particular the july 2007 flare announces the possibility to detect a centroid motion .",
    "the future interferometer gravity at the vlti will most likely be able to resolve proper motion of individual flares .",
    "such a measurement would not only further constrain the hot spot model , but also probe spacetime in the strong field limit of general relativity .",
    "thus , our simulations provide theoretical predictions from fundamental physics that can be tested in the near future .",
    "this work received the support of phase , the high angular resolution partnership between onera , observatoire de paris , cnrs and university denis diderot paris 7 .",

    "<S> first , we use a simplified model of a small steady source in order to investigate the relativistic effects qualitatively . a more realistic scenario is then being developed by fitting our model to existing flare data . </S>",
    "<S> while indications for the spin of the black hole and multiple images due to lensing effects are marginal in the light curves , astrometric measurements offer the possibility to reveal these high - order general relativistic effects . </S>",
    "<S> this study makes predictions on these astrometric measurements and leads us to the conclusion that future infrared interferometers will be able to detect proper motion of hot spots in the vicinity of sagittarius  a*. </S>"
