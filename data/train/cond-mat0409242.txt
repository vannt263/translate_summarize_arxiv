    "a ferromagnet is a symmetry - broken state in which a majority of electrons point their spin into a certain common direction below critical temperatures as high as 1000  k. the robustness of the magnetic order and the permanence of a given magnetization direction against elevated temperatures and external perturbations have been employed in applications as diverse as compass needles , refrigerator - door stickers , and memory devices .    in spite of its stability ,",
    "ferromagnetism is neither rigid nor static .",
    "depending on sample size and anisotropies due to crystal field and sample shape , a single - domain ferromagnet is often unstable with respect to a domain structure that lowers the macroscopic magnetic energy .",
    "thermal fluctuations reduce the macroscopic moment until it completely vanishes at the critical temperature @xmath0 . at temperatures sufficiently below @xmath0 ,",
    "the internal dynamics of the ferromagnet are dominated by low - energy transverse fluctuations of the magnetization , so - called spin waves or magnons , that are the magnetic equivalence of phonons in a lattice .",
    "classical course - grain computer simulations of the detailed position- and time - dependent magnetization (  micromagnetism \" ) describe these phenomena well @xcite .",
    "when magnetic grains become sufficiently small , the exchange stiffness renders domain structures energetically unfavorable and a single - domain picture is adequate .",
    "when the ferromagnet is exposed to a uniform driving field , the macroscopic magnetization dynamics may then be dominated by a collective precession of the entire ferromagnetic order parameter . restricting the ferromagnetic degrees of freedom to this mode",
    "is often referred to as the  macrospin model . \" in infinite ferromagnetic media , low - energy spin waves resemble symmetry - restoring goldstone modes , but in real life , the spin - rotational symmetry is broken by magnetic anisotropies caused by magnetic dipolar fields or by crystal - field spin - orbit interactions . in thermodynamic equilibrium , the macrospin then points in a certain fixed direction with small thermal fluctuations around it .",
    "the ferromagnet can still be coerced into motion by applying external magnetic fields at a finite angle to the magnetization direction .",
    "the system then moves in response , trying to minimize its zeeman energy .",
    "the compass needle , a freely suspended single - domain ferromagnet with a sufficiently high anisotropy ( coercivity ) , does this by alignment of its lattice . in this review ,",
    "we are interested in mechanically - fixed magnets whose magnetic moments move in the presence of external and anisotropy effective magnetic fields , as well as applied electric currents .",
    "viscous damping processes are required to achieve a reorientation ( switching ) of the magnetization , if , for example , a magnetic - field direction is suddenly changed .",
    "minimization of this finite switching time by engineering magnetic anisotropies and magnetization - damping rates is an important goal in the design of fast magnetic memories .",
    "when the applied magnetic fields are large enough to surmount the anisotropies , the magnetization can be reversed , often by large amplitude and complex trajectories , even in the simple macrospin model . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the magnetization reorientation becomes probabilistic and is described by a fokker - planck equation on the unit sphere @xcite .    in the last two decades ,",
    "a new subdiscipline in the field of magnetism has risen that is devoted to the studies of heterostructures of ferromagnets ( f ) with normal metals ( n ) and , to a lesser extent , semiconductors and superconductors .",
    "especially magnetoelectronics , the science and technology directed at understanding and utilizing the transport properties of layered structures of ferromagnetic and normal metals , has grown into a mainstream topic of condensed - matter physics .",

    "it is therefore a quantum - interference effect sensitive to defect scattering , which vanishes exponentially with increasing spacer - layer thickness .",
    "gmr stands for a significant reduction of the resistance of multilayers when the magnetic configuration is forced from antiparallel to parallel by an applied magnetic field .",
    "in disordered multilayers , it is a semiclassical transport effect that can be understood in terms of a diffusion equation @xcite . in a configuration in which the currents are oriented perpendicular to the interface planes ( cpp ) @xcite",

    "the spin - relaxation processes are usually modeled by a local finite - resistance link connecting the spin - up and spin - down circuits .",
    "initially , the community focused its attention on stationary magnetic states , like those responsible for the magnetoresistance in metallic and tunneling structures with applied dc bias .",
    "this has changed drastically in recent years .",

    "these authors demonstrated that microwave transmission through normal - metal foils facilitated by conduction - electron spin transfer is significantly enhanced by ferromagnetic - layer coating .",
    "this review covers the developments in the understanding of the magnetization dynamics in heterostructures of ferromagnets and normal conductors in the last five years or so .",
    "we believe that the time is ripe , since from a microscopic point of view , much of the basic physics is well understood .",

    "the discovery that the energy of magnetic multilayers made from alternating ferromagnetic and normal - metal films depends on the relative direction of the individual magnetizations @xcite is perhaps the most important in magnetoelectronics .",
    "the existence of the antiparallel ground - state configuration at certain spacer - layer thicknesses was essential for the subsequent discovery of the giant magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "adjacent ferromagnetic layers in such structures are coupled by nonlocal and , as a function of normal - metal layer thickness , oscillatory @xcite exchange interaction that can be qualitatively understood by perturbation theory analogous to the rkky @xcite exchange coupling between magnetic impurities in a normal - metal host .",
    "different oscillation periods , which can be resolved in measured magnetization configuration as a function of spacer thickness , are well explained in terms of the normal - metal fermi surface calipers in the growth direction .",
    "the magnetic ground - state configuration is , at least in principle , accessible to first - principles electronic - structure calculations in the spin - density  functional theory formalism , and that is basically the end of the story .",
    "however , in order to make connection to the main topic of this review , we briefly discuss the formulation of the equilibrium exchange coupling in terms of scattering theory @xcite , that can also be formulated from first principles and calculated by density - functional theory @xcite .",
    "another advantage of a scattering - theory formulation is that effects of disorder can be understood employing the machinery of mesoscopic physics , such as random - matrix @xcite or diagrammatic perturbation theory .",

    "the angle and thickness dependence of the total energy ( [ toten ] ) can be understood in terms of the variation of the interference pattern of the spin - dependent electron waves in and close to the normal - metal spacer . by varying @xmath4 and @xmath3 ,",

    "the minimum energy for a given @xmath4 is usually found at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , i.e. , either parallel or antiparallel configurations are favored .",
    "though exponentially suppressed , the coupling between the magnetic layers persists when the insertion is an insulating barrier @xcite .    of special interest is the asymptotic dependence of energy @xmath15 for large @xmath4 . in this limit ,",
    "the sharp jumps in energy by the population or depopulation of individual quantum - well states as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath3 become less prominent .",
    "the quasi - continuous angular dependence of the energy in this limit is well described by the lowest term in the expansion into legendre polynomials : @xmath16 which is a sum of contributions from each critical caliper at the fermi surface of the normal - metal spacer labeled by @xmath17 .",

    "the derivative @xmath21 does not vanish .",
    "a finite @xmath22 is therefore interpreted as an exchange torque acting on the magnetizations , pulling them into an energetically - favorable configuration .",

    "a spin valve that is  strained \" by a relative misalignment of the magnetization directions from their lowest - energy configuration therefore supports dissipationless spin currents .",
    "the situation is quite analogous to the josephson junction in which a difference of the superconducting phase over a weak link induces a supercurrent .",

    "( [ tde ] ) .",
    "essential for the existence and the magnitude of the nonlocal exchange coupling and the corresponding persistent spin currents is the phase coherence of the wave functions in the normal spacer .",
    "an incoming electron in the spacer with information of the left magnetization direction has to be reflected at the right interface and interfere with itself at the left interface in order to convey the coupling information .",
    "this implies strong sensitivity to the effects of impurities , since the diffuse scattering destroys the regular interference pattern required by a sizable coupling .",

    "we find that , on top of the equilibrium spin currents that communicate the nonlocal static exchange coupling , a dynamic exchange interaction with a much longer range becomes important .",
    "any significant coupling at equilibrium in the dynamic studies can be represented approximately in terms of parametrized conservative forces that react to deviations from equilibrium without interference with nonequilibrium spin currents .",

    "the charge and spin transport in the intermediate configurations in which the magnetizations vary between parallel and antiparallel is important in the context of the present review due to the emergence of transverse spin currents that are absorbed by the magnetizations and contribute as a driving torque to the dynamics .",

    "close to an equilibrium axis with rotational symmetry , the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation ( [ llg ] ) is obeyed by a small - angle damped circular precession , while in the presence of anisotropies , small - angle trajectories are elliptic and the damping is in general a tensor . for most of our purposes ,",

    "these authors found that the spin pumping by a moving ferromagnet into a luttinger liquid through a tunnel barrier is given by the same expression as for noninteracting electrons , viz . , eq .",
    "( [ is ] ) , but with parameters @xmath345 and @xmath774 vanishing as a power of temperature at low temperatures with an exponent characteristic for the luttinger - liquid zero - bias anomaly in tunneling density of states .",
    "correlation effects might also become important if one wishes to describe spin pumping close to the ferromagnetic critical temperature , to understand significant deviations from the macrospin model for the magnetization , and to quantitatively model the spin - pumping parameter for interfaces with strongly - correlated materials .",
    "in this review , we presented a coherent picture of the nonlocal magnetization dynamics in heterostructures of ferromagnets and nonmagnetic conductors .",
    "it is based on the assumption of semiclassical transport in the bulk materials that is valid for diffuse and chaotic systems , as well as a separation of time scales of the electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "interfaces are treated as sharp quantum - mechanical boundary conditions for electron distribution functions and nonequilibrium transport . except for the phenomenological treatment of spin - flip scattering processes ,",
    "the theory is derived from first principles .",
    "the main subject in this context was the concept of spin pumping due to moving magnetization vectors .",
    "the magnetization dynamics affected by the spin - transfer torque in the presence of an electrical bias should be treated on equal footing with the spin pumping .",
    "the crucial material parameter is the spin - mixing conductance that can be computed from _ ab initio _ electronic band structures .",
    "several phenomena can be predicted or explained based on the basic formalism .",
    "one of them is the increased gilbert damping of thin magnetic films in good electrical contact with normal metals that efficiently dissipate spin angular momentum . in more complex magnetic structures",
    ", we predict an interplay between the spin pumping and magnetization torques that is truly nonlocal , i.e. , depends on the entire spin - coherent volume of the sample ( determined by the spin - flip diffusion length ) .",
    "novel collective effects appear when different magnetic elements in a spin - coherent circuit or device resonate at nearby frequencies .",
    "a moving ferromagnet can be used as a source that pumps spin currents into normal metals or semiconductors , that leads to a spin accumulation determined by the ferromagnetic - resonance frequency .",
    "although some basic principles are rather subtle , the final formalism is easy to use .",
    "it can often be mapped on an equivalent circuit model that is governed by a few parameters that can be either fitted to experiments or computed from first principles .",
    "such calculations can be used , e.g. , to estimate and optimize critical magnetization - switching currents @xcite .",
    "we focused attention on quasi - one - dimensional configurations and the macrospin model for the magnetization .",
    "generalization of the formalism to include spin - wave excitations in the ferromagnet or inhomogeneous spin currents have also been illustrated ( sec .",
    "[ nmd ] ) .",
    "integration of micromagnetic simulations with the transport equations based on boundary conditions at the interfaces as described here might be necessary to improve the accuracy of first - principles modeling .    in the review , we had mainly metallic heterostructures with transition - metal ferromagnets in mind .",
    "but since the approach is quite general , we should by no means exclude other materials .",
    "we already speculated in sec .",
    "[ sdm ] that the formalism can be used to understand the gilbert damping in magnetic semiconductors .",
    "there is little doubt that a modeling of the current - induced switching of ( ga , mn)as observed by requires the concept of magnetization torque .",
    "the spin pumping into carbon nanotubes as investigated by is partly suppressed by correlation effects .",
    "the spin pumping by ferromagnetic superconductors @xcite is entangled with cooper - pair pumping and depends on the spin - pairing symmetry of the superconducting state .",
    "spin dynamics in heterostructures of high - density magnets in contact with doped semiconductors @xcite are another promising playground for the formalism described here . besides , it is possible to generalize the spin - pumping picture to other symmetry - broken heterostructures with adiabatically - varying order parameters @xcite .",
    "a critical parameter in the nonlocal magnetization dynamics is the spin - flip diffusion length in the normal - metal components , that can be of the order of microns even at room temperature , see , e.g. , .",
    "the nonlocal effects in structures based on transition metals could therefore be robust and observable at ambient temperatures .",
    "we therefore believe that the formalism discussed here should be useful to understand , compute , and design magnetic - device operations .",
    "an example is the possibility of ",
    "@xmath17 engineering \" based on the increase of the gilbert damping in ultrathin magnetic films , e.g. , by an order of magnitude by just evaporating a few monolayers of pt on top of it .",
    "we also expect that with decreasing size of magnetic circuits and devices , the dynamic coupling discussed in this review will become even more relevant .",
    "it might lead to effects like cross talk between magnetic elements and excess noise . on the other hand , proper engineering of phenomena like the nonlocal dynamic locking might lead to an increased stability against external perturbations as well .",
