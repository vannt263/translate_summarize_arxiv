    ", operation experience with mdt chambers was gained with the prototype in the muon test beam at cern .",
    "for the prototype chamber , the sense wires were positioned and fixed at the tube ends using external references for tubes and wire and fast - curing glue ( see fig .  [ glue ] ) .",

    "the injection moulding process of the insulating plastic ( noryl ) body of the endplugs with the metal inserts has been carefully optimised in order to prevent stresses and the development of cracks which can make the drift tubes leak .",

    "the combs have been produced industrially by spark erosion and are installed on a flat granite table in a clean room of class 100000 with temperature and relative humidity controlled to be @xmath47c and @xmath48 , respectively . over their whole length the tubes are held straight in 9 parallel rows of combs with vacuum suction .",
    "the tube layers inserted in the combs are glued subsequently to the aluminum space frame ( three cross plates connected by two long beams ; see fig .  [ table1 ] ) which for this purpose is positioned with respect to the combs with an accuracy of @xmath59 m in @xmath7 and @xmath12 on precision towers at the ends of the three cross plates ( see fig .",

    "the gravitational sag of the cross plates during assembly is measured with optical sensors installed on the cross plates ( see fig .",
    "[ sag2 ] ) . in order to prevent deformations of the tube layers after glueing them to the space frame ,",
    "the cross plates are also supported via the long beams applying forces with computer controlled pneumatic actuators until the sag is compensated without lifting the chamber from the reference towers .",
    "after positioning the chamber on the reference towers , the pneumatic actuators instantaneously apply the required forces at the ends of 4 bars inserted through holes in the long beams close to the cross plates as shown in fig .",
    "[ table1 ] .",
    "the wire positions in the completed chambers have been measured at cern  @xcite with scans with stereo x - ray sources perpendicular to the wires .",
    "the reproducibility of the x - ray measurements of the wire coordinates was within @xmath61 m ( rms ) during the scans of the prototype chamber in 1998 and now is within @xmath58 m ( rms ) .",
    "a fit of an ideal wire grid to the measured wire coordinates @xmath7 ( perpendicular to the tube layers ) and @xmath12 ( parallel to the tube layers ) allows a determination of the geometrical parameters of the chamber and to evaluate the wire positioning accuracy . in table",

    "the @xmath15 values at both ends of this chamber differ because of a known common @xmath7-offset of the wire positions in the tubes at the readout end . during the assembly of the bos-0 chamber , an unexpectedly large shrinkage of the glue between tube layers and frame",
    "was observed which is taken into account in the design values . with the different type of glue used for the bos  98 chamber , no significant glue shrinkage was observed . for both chambers ,",
    "the fitted parameters agree very well with the design values .",

    "the widths of the distributions for x - ray measurements at both ends of the chambers as well as near the center are summarised in table  [ width ] .",
    "the wire locations at intermediate positions between the tube ends are determined by the wire locations at the ends ( weighted averages ) and by the gravitational sag @xmath63 of the wires .",
    "the wire sag is known from the measurement of the wire oscillation frequency @xmath55 via the relation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "variations in the maximum wire sag of @xmath57 ( rms ) of the nominal @xmath66 m due to the variations of the wire tension are negligible .    the residuals of the @xmath7-coordinates are shown in figs .",
    "[ res1 ] and [ res2 ] .",
    "the gravitational sag of the cross plates which has to be compensated for the assembly of each tube layer ( see fig .  [ sag2 ] ) is indicated .",
    "the bos-0 chamber , for cost reasons , has less stiff cross plates than the prototype chamber and therefore larger cross plate sag .",
    "the statistical fluctuations of the wire locations are larger in the prototype chamber because the aluminum tube walls , instead of the precise endplugs , were used as references for the positioning of the drift tubes    the wire positioning accuracy in the prototype chamber is better than the required @xmath2 m ( rms ) . with the first production chamber ,",
    "a wire positioning accuracy of better than @xmath3 m ( rms ) has been achieved for one of the largest chamber types in the atlas muon spectrometer .",
    "the main improvement with respect to wire positioning accuracy compared to the prototype chamber is the introduction of the aluminum reference ring on the endplugs which allows more precise positioning of the drift tube ends on the assembly combs than the aluminum tube walls used before .",
    "based on the present experience , a wire positioning accuracy of about @xmath43 m ( rms ) is reachable for such large chambers .",
    "the prototype chamber has been tested in a 300  gev muon beam at cern at perpendicular incidence to the tube layers .",
    "ar : co@xmath67 @xmath68 at 3  bar was used as drift gas . using a silicon strip detector telescope as external reference , the space to drift - time relationship and the position resolution as a function of the drift distance r have been determined .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ resol ] ) .",
    "the average single - tube resolution at the low interaction rates is @xmath69 m ( rms ) .",
    "the r - t - relationship measured locally was applied to the other drift tubes in the beam allowing only the maximum drift time to vary within @xmath70  ns ( rms ) because of varying operating conditions . requiring the track residual distributions as function of the drift distance to be symmetric left and right of the wires provides information about displacements of the wires from their nominal positions in @xmath12-direction with respect to a reference wire .",
    "comparison with the x - ray measurements of the @xmath12-coordinates of the wires shows a good correlation ( see fig .",
    "[ wirepos ] ) .",
