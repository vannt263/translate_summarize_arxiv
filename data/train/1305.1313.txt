    "natural supersymmetry is the holy grail of beyond - the - standard model physics .",
    "it contains a sparticle spectrum where sparticle masses are inversely proportional to their leading - log contributions to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale . at tree - level",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is determined by balancing the higgsino mass - squared against the scalar higgs mass - squareds .",
    "this implies the leading contribution to electroweak symmetry breaking comes from the higgsino mass itself , and thus implies the higgsinos are the lightest sparticles in natural supersymmetry .",
    "the next largest contributions come from one - loop corrections from the stops .",
    "we consider the three scenarios : ( i ) @xmath0 is light , ( ii ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 are light , and ( iii ) @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 are light .",
    "this spans the space of possibilities for various stop ( and sbottom ) mass hierarchies consistent with natural supersymmetry .",
    "after this comes the contributions come from the wino and gluino ( in the mssm ) , but their masses can be several times larger than the stop masses , given their comparatively suppressed contributions to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "natural supersymmetry suggests the lightest electroweakinos can be nearly pure higgsino - like states .",
    "this spectrum is well - known @xcite , and the lhc experiments have already provided outstanding constraints on simplified models involving light stops  @xcite , light sbottoms  @xcite , and gluinos that decay into these sparticles  @xcite .",
    "further improvement in the bounds may be possible with specialized search strategies , for recent examples see  @xcite .",
    "however , the results presented thus far typically make strong assumptions about branching fractions [ @xmath10 or @xmath11 . in the 1-lepton mode @xcite and all - hadronic mode @xcite , where constraints on the branching fraction @xmath12 were shown , assuming the remaining of the branching fraction is unobservable .",
    "natural supersymmetry , however , predicts branching fractions into several channels that are observable , as we will see . ] in addition , in cases where both a light chargino and a light neutralino are present , the results assume certain mass hierarchies : @xmath13  @xcite or @xmath14  @xcite or @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "these assumptions make it difficult to extract the true bounds on natural supersymmetry .",
    "consequently , we have undertaken a re - evaluation of the constraints on natural supersymmetry using the existing lhc results on simplified models involving light stops and sbottoms .",
    "it is also well - known that there is an intricate interplay between a light third generation and higgs physics .",
    "supersymmetry predicts the mass of the lightest higgs boson to high accuracy through radiative corrections that are dominated by just the third generation squarks  @xcite .",
    "if the third generation squarks are collectively light ( say , @xmath16  tev ) , the predicted mass of the higgs boson is too small to be compatible with the atlas and cms observation @xcite of a @xmath17  gev higgs - like boson ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand , light third generation sparticles",
    "can significantly modify the detailed properties  production cross section and decay rates  of the lightest higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "we consider the effects of natural supersymmetry on the detailed properties of the lightest higgs boson . here",
    "we are not interested in _ maximizing _ a particular decay channel or fitting to the existing higgs results , but instead we endeavor to simply understand the characteristics that natural supersymmetry has on higgs physics . our main result is to overlay the modifications to the higgs physics onto the allowed parameter space of natural supersymmetry .",
    "two interesting regions emerge . in the `` compressed wedge '' region where @xmath6 and @xmath18 can be small ,",
    "the effects on higgs physics are to enhance the inclusive ( gluon - fusion dominated ) cross section @xmath19 by @xmath20-@xmath21 simultaneous with a slight reduction of @xmath22 by up to @xmath23 .",
    "by contrast , in the `` kinematic limit '' region where @xmath7-@xmath8  gev , there is a slight enhancement of @xmath22 by up to @xmath23 , with the inclusive ( gluon - fusion dominated ) cross section @xmath19 within a few @xmath24 of the standard model result . while the experimental situation the lhc collaborations is not yet settled , it is already clear that these two regions lead to distinctly different effects on higgs properties that can be probed with @xmath9 measurements .    given light stops and sbottoms , we must consider the supersymmetric prediction for the lightest higgs boson mass .",
    "we assert that natural supersymmetry  in the mssm  is simply _",
    "incompatible _ with obtaining a lightest higgs boson mass consistent with the lhc data .",
    "this point has been emphasized in some recent work , for example  @xcite .",
    "hence , we do not restrict the third generation squark masses to obtain a given lightest higgs boson mass .",
    "instead , we assume there is another contribution to the quartic coupling that is sufficient to augment the mssm contributions , resulting in a higgs mass that matches experiment , @xmath25  gev .",
    "not specifying this contribution would seem to be fatal flaw of our analysis .",
    "we show that simple extensions of the mssm , in particular the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , can give both a sufficient boost to the quartic coupling with negligible effects on the higgsino mass spectrum and the decay chains that we consider here .",
    "specific examples of nmssm parameter choices that realize our assertion are given in appendix  [ sec : nmssm ] .",
    "we do not consider the gluino in this paper .",
    "the gluino contributions to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale may be significant in the mssm , given the existing searches that suggest the gluino must be heavier than @xmath26-@xmath27  tev , depending on the search strategy  @xcite .",
    "however , the size of the gluino contribution to electroweak symmetry breaking is model - dependent : a dirac gluino has a substantially smaller contribution to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale compared with a majorana gluino , when the leading - log enhancements are included , allowing a dirac gluino to be substantially heavier  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the search strategies for a gluino depend on its majorana or dirac character .",
    "one of the most important search strategies  involving same - sign dileptons ( such as  @xcite ) does not provide a constraint on a dirac gluino .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is determined by , at tree - level  @xcite , @xmath28 in saying `` contribution to the electroweak scale '' , it is understood that the supersymmetric and supersymmetry breaking parameters are adjusted to obtain the value already determined by experiment .",
    "here we are interested in the _ relative size _ of @xmath29 and the loop corrections to the electroweak breaking scale , i.e. , @xmath30 .    for @xmath31",
    "very near @xmath26 , the coefficient of the first term in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : ewsbtree ] ) becomes large , because the @xmath32-flat direction in the scalar potential is not lifted , and thus implies increased sensitivity to the supersymmetric parameters .",
    "the sensitivity is most easily understood by eliminating dependence on @xmath33 using the tree - level relation @xcite @xmath34 to obtain @xmath35 at large @xmath31 , however , eq .  ( [ eq : ewsbma ] ) simplifies to @xmath36 and eliminates dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "generally , we have taken @xmath38 for the analyses to follow , and thus the heavy higgs scalars that acquire masses near @xmath39 can be readily decoupled from our analysis .",
    "however , the smaller @xmath31 region reappears in our discussion of the nmssm in appendix  [ sec : nmssm ] , where the the relative contributions to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale become more complicated for the nmssm scalar potential .    with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ewsblargetb ] ) in mind , we can compare the relative importance of different contributions to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale by normalizing to @xmath40 @xcite @xmath41 the tree - level and one - loop contributions are well - known ( e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath42    in the mssm , there are also important one - loop contributions from a majorana wino and two - loop contributions from a majorana gluino ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath43    here we somewhat arbitrarily chose to normalize all of our numerical evaluations to a factor of @xmath20 times @xmath40 , as well as normalizing the size of the leading - logs to @xmath44 .",
    ", since a conservative interpretation of lhc bounds is that the gluino already exceeds @xmath27  tev in viable scenarios .",
    "] this small ratio implicitly assumes a low scale for the messenger sector , and thus the smallest sensitivity of supersymmetry breaking parameters to the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "this provides suggestive values for @xmath29 , the stop masses , and in the mssm , the wino and gluino masses .",
    "as these parameters significantly differ from these suggestive values , their relative importance to determining ( or fine - tuning to determine ) the electroweak scale is altered accordingly .",
    "in particular , we see that @xmath45  gev gives a comparable contribution to a pair of stops at @xmath46  gev .",
    "the natural supersymmetry predictions for the wino and gluino mass depend on whether they acquire majorana or dirac masses .",
    "already we see that if the wino acquires a majorana mass , its mass is expected to be nearly @xmath26  tev .",
    "a dirac wino would have a mass considerably larger .",
    "similarly a majorana gluino is expected to be @xmath47  tev ( with the normalization of the logs as given above ) , and again significantly larger than this if it acquires a dirac mass .    for the purposes of this paper , we assume the gluino is either sufficiently heavy so as to not lead to collider constraints ( in practice , this means a majorana gluino needs to be above about @xmath27  tev  @xcite ) , or it acquires a dirac mass , in which case its natural supersymmetry mass is well out of range of the lhc .",
    "we assume the wino and bino acquires @xmath48  tev masses , but our results are largely insensitive to this choice .          in the limit @xmath49 , the lightest chargino and the lightest two neutralinos are higgsino - like and",
    "nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "the leading contributions to the mass difference at order @xmath50 , @xmath51 which we can write as @xmath52 clearly , the mass differences among the higgsinos are just a few gev when @xmath53 take on natural ( heavy ) values .",
    "the decays @xmath54 thus yield unobservably small energy in the decay products .",
    "the mass difference is , however , large enough that the decay rates are prompt on collider time scales and thus there are no macroscopic signatures in the detector ( at least for wino and bino masses that do not far exceed @xmath48  tev ) .",
    "hence , for the purposes of lhc detection , @xmath55 behave as neutral lightest supersymmetric particles that escape the detector as missing energy .      evidently from eq .",
    "( [ eq : stopsewsb ] ) , the natural supersymmetry prediction for the stop masses depends on the sum @xmath56 .",
    "all other things considered equal , @xmath57 implies the sum @xmath58 must be correspondingly smaller to hold the sum @xmath56 constant .",
    "we therefore take @xmath59 to vanish .",
    "while this might give some readers pause , regarding the stop contributions to the lightest higgs mass , recall that we have already asserted that the mssm is incapable of providing a sufficient contribution , and so the choice @xmath60 is not inconsistent with our approach .",
    "instead , we consider the following mass hierarchies ( `` scenarios '' ) for natural supersymmetry : ( i ) @xmath0 is light , ( ii ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 are light , and ( iii ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are light .",

    "we discuss this in the next section .",
    "all other gauginos , all sleptons , and the first and second generation squarks are taken to be sufficiently heavy that they do not play a role in the low energy phenomenology , consistent with natural supersymmetry .",
    "we emphasize that the difference between scenarios i , ii , and iii is not that the stops are believed to be far different in mass , but simply different enough in mass that the low energy phenomenology is dominated by one of these three scenarios .",

    "however , by interpolating between our results for the three given scenarios , it is possible to reconstruct qualitatively what happens when @xmath83 .",

    "the lower bound on the lsp mass comes from the lep bound on charginos  we must obey this bound since @xmath88 .",
    "finally , while the viability of stops with mass @xmath89 remains an interesting question , we concentrate on @xmath90 , consistent with the natural supersymmetry spectrum .",
    "we also impose an additional restriction on the parameter space , namely , to not let the mass difference between the squarks and the higgsino become too small .",

    "stop decays in compressed spectra often lead to to multiple - body final states that are difficult to model without better tools .",
    "additionally , the collider limits on nearly degenerate spectra become sensitive to how the additional radiation in the event ( isr ) is modeled .",
    "we chose to simulate the sensitivity of these searches in natural supersymmetry for somewhat smaller mass differences , @xmath77  gev . as we will see , we find the existing lhc searches are sensitive to natural supersymmetry with splittings this small .",
    "however this region needs to be interpreted with some care , since we are obtaining constraints from both stop searches and sbottoms searches .",
    "sbottom searches have somewhat different restrictions on the kinematics , but since we chose a minimum mass difference between the soft mass @xmath94 and the lightest neutralino , the highly compressed region with respect to the sbottom and neutralino is not simulated .",
    "we therefore do not anticipate significant changes in the bounds for the parameter space we consider .    for each scenario at a given mass point",

    "some model is needed , and for that we rely on the simulation method described above .    before describing the details of the searches we consider ,",
    "it is important to emphasize that the _ absolute _ bounds we present are only approximate . to derive the signal efficiency we have used fast - simulation tools ( delphes ) whose energy smearing and tagging functions are approximations  usually optimistic  of the full detector effects . in multi - jet ,",
    "especially multi-@xmath100-jet final states , the differences between the fast and full - detector simulations add up , making it tricky for us to match the quoted absolute bounds on a given scenario . to improve the accuracy of the absolute bounds , the scenarios presented here should be studied by cms / atlas themselves , either as a dedicated reanalysis or using a tool such as recast  @xcite . meanwhile , the relative bounds , i.e. the difference between scenario i and scenario ii , are robust .      in this section",
    "we present the limits on the supernatural scenarios from the most recent lhc direct stop searches  @xcite .",
    "bounds from these searches are usually ( though not always ) cast in term of stops that decay either 100% of the time to a top quark and a neutralino or 100% of the time to a bottom quark and a chargino .",
    "stops are searched for in several different final states , and the first two stop analyses we consider are semileptonic searches . while the details differ between the atlas and cms searches ( see appendix [ app : search ] for the full analyses description ) , both require a hard lepton , significant missing energy , and at least four jets , one of which must be tagged as a @xmath100-jet .    running our three scenarios through the cms direct stop search  @xcite , we find the following exclusion contours in the @xmath116 plane ( fig .

    "this spectrum is close to the default signal model used by atlas . as the handedness of the stop and the identity of the lsp",
    "are fixed , the polarization of the emerging top quark is also fixed .    by comparing our scenarios with the stop signal models usually used , we can see how the higgsino - like nature of the lsp and the hierarchy of the third generation squarks effects what regions of parameter space are allowed .",

    "the brown dashed line shows the limit on a second default scenario : right - handed stops decaying to top plus bino .",
    "the difference between the black and brown dashed lines gives some indication how the polarization of the top can affect limits .",
    "the black dotted line is @xmath119 , which is the self - imposed restriction on the cms analysis , since isr is not properly taken into account when the signal is generated with pythia .",
    "we have also restricted our re - analysis in the `` compressed wedge '' region [ where @xmath120 , requiring @xmath121  gev , that results in the excluded region extending slightly to the left of the black dotted line .",
    "see the text for details.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we can understand the strength of the bounds on our scenarios by looking at the branching ratios and final states of our spectra . as we have decoupled the gauginos in all of our setups ,",
    "the decays of the stops and sbottoms are governed entirely by the yukawa couplings .",
    "for example , in scenario i , all decays come from the top - yukawa ; up to kinematics , this yields a 50 - 50 split between decays to top quark plus neutralino and bottom quark plus chargino and 50% to @xmath122 .",
    "however , this distinction does not make affect our analysis , since the two states have essentially the same mass ] .",
    "due to the degeneracy of the chargino - neutralino sector , chargino decay products are all extremely soft . in particular , the leptons from a chargino decay are far too soft to trigger the analysis requirements for the stop analysis , thus the only source of leptons is from the stops that decay to a leptonically decaying top quark .",
    "additionally , mixed decays @xmath123 may have a hard lepton , but they typically have fewer jets than required for a stop analysis .",
    "therefore , only the fraction of events where both the stop and antistop decay to top + neutralino have a high probability of passing the analysis requirements . as an final suppression , because the light stop in scenario i is ( almost ) entirely right handed , the top quarks it yields are left - handed . due to the v - a nature of the weak interaction , left - handed tops",
    "have a softer lepton spectrum , and thus the leptons that the stops decays do create are less likely to pass the analysis cuts  @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of these suppression factors is that there is no bound from the cms direct stop search on scenario i.    similar logic works to understand the bounds on scenario ii and iii . in scenario",
    "ii , both the @xmath124 and @xmath125 are produced . up to effects of @xmath126 and ignoring kinematics , the only decay channel possible is @xmath127 for the stop and @xmath128 for the sbottom .",
    "the stop therefore decays in exactly the same way as in the default scenario , so we expect the bound to be at least as strong as the t2tt bound ( with the added effect that the top is always right - handed and thus the emitted lepton is harder than in the unpolarized case ) .",
    "the bound is actually stronger because the sbottom decays also contribute ; the chargino in a sbottom decay is indistinguishable from a neutralino , so the final state from a sbottom decay is virtually identical to the stop case .",
    "the only place the bound on scenario ii may weaken is close to or below the @xmath129 threshold , where @xmath130 decays become important .",
    "finally , we expect an even stronger bound in scenario iii .",
    "in addition to the @xmath131 decay that contributes exactly as in scenario iii , there are now two stop states and both states will contribute to the stop search .",
    "these suspicions are confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmsstops ] .    moving to the atlas semi - leptonic stop search",
    ", we find similar results , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atlstops ] .",
    "this is not surprising as the search criteria are very similar to the cms stop search  a single hard lepton and four or more hard jets .",
    "the biggest difference between the atlas and cms semi - leptonic stop searches is that atlas requires a `` hadronic top candidate ''  a three - jet subsystem with mass between @xmath132 and @xmath133  in all events .",
    "this requirement , along with slight changes in the analysis variables ( see appendix [ app : search ] ) lead to different limits , but the qualitative message is the same as in the previous case : scenarios with @xmath134 are not bounded by these searches because the stops decay preferentially to @xmath135 and therefore lack sufficient hard leptons and jet multiplicity , while scenarios with light @xmath136 are bounded tighter than the benchmark @xmath137 scenario because both the stop and the sbottom decays contain top quarks ( t2tt model ) with the exclusions from atlas , we see a discrepancy  our bounds are weaker by @xmath138 .",
    "the fact that the delphes - based bound is different from the quoted number is not surprising , but the discrepancy is somewhat larger than expected . atlas has provided a cut - flow , at least for some benchmark @xmath115 points , which allows us to pinpoint the difference to the @xmath139 cut ( relative efficiencies of cuts either before or after this cut match to @xmath140 ) .",
    "we suspect the reason the @xmath139 cut is discrepant is that the jet - energy resolution in delphes is overly optimistic .",
    "if the jets retain too much of their energy , then the @xmath139 distribution will be shifted to higher values ( relative to the full detector ) and lost once the cut @xmath141 is imposed .",
    "if we increase the upper @xmath139 cut by @xmath142 , the signal efficiency at the benchmark point agrees better with the quoted value , however this artificial shift will have uncontrollable implications in the rest of the @xmath115 efficiency plane .",
    "therefore , we stay with the quoted cuts and emphasize that the relative bounds between models are the most relevant .",
    "the strong sensitivity of the bounds to @xmath139 also serves as a warning to the experiments since @xmath139 is susceptible to effects from isr , the underlying event , and pileup . ] .",

    "given the recent discovery of a particle consistent with a higgs boson at @xmath25  gev @xcite , the modifications due to the additional charged and colored degrees of freedom have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "first let us consider the higgs boson branching ratios .",
    "when the stop contributions are included , the modification to the decay rate of the higgs boson into gluons is given by  @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 are the standard fermion ( scalar ) loop functions ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and @xmath175 .",

    "similarly , for sbottoms the contributions are typically small except in the large @xmath180 regime where sbottom contributions will interfere destructively with the top contribution .",
    "light stops , sbottoms , staus and charginos also affect the decay of the higgs boson into photons . enhancing the decay rate of the higgs to gluons due to light stops will lead to a suppressed decay rate of the higgs into photons due to the stop contribution destructively interfering with the @xmath181-boson contribution ( the dominant standard model contribution ) , while a light sbottom has the opposite effect . furthermore , depending on the sign of @xmath79 , a light higgsino close to the lep bound  @xcite can either enhance or suppress the photon rate  @xcite .",
    "expanding in terms of the @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the wino mass parameter , we find the amplitude of the lightest chargino is @xmath184 is the w - boson mass , @xmath183 is the wino mass , @xmath185 and @xmath186 is the mixing angle of the cp - even higgs bosons . in the decoupling limit @xmath187 ,",

    "these deviations are not large enough to be directly constrained by the measurements from the lhc  @xcite and tevatron  @xcite , however as we measure the higgs production and branching ratios more precisely , we expect these deviations to be observable at the lhc .",
    "we have shown that natural supersymmetry , where third generation squarks decay into higgsino - like neutralinos and chargino , is significantly constrained by existing lhc searches , summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] . when these constraints are overlayed on the modifications to the lightest higgs production and decay , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainf ] , we find distinctly different implications for the remaining allowed regions identified as the `` compressed wedge '' ( @xmath6 ) and the `` kinematic limit '' ( @xmath199-@xmath8  gev ) .",
    "we found that the collider constraints arise from the totality of numerous searches at atlas and cms that are separately sensitive , in varying degrees , to squark production and decay through @xmath200 , @xmath4 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 .",
    "our analysis incorporated simulations of the signal and detector response , matching the experimental analyses as close as we could .",
    "nevertheless , there is substantial room for improvement .",
    "much of the experimental searches were designed for only one decay mode , or chose chargino / neutralino mass hierarchies that are not consistent with natural supersymmetry .",
    "we believe dedicated analyses , that take into account the proper branching fractions and mass hierarchy , may well significantly improve the sensitivity .",
    "natural supersymmetry implies the wino and bino are sufficiently heavy that the higgsino - like chargino and neutralino splittings are very small , just several gev .",
    "while we focused our attention on the stop / sbottom signals , the electroweakinos ( higgsinos ) can be directly produced at the lhc .",
    "however , the narrow splittings of the higgsinos makes them extremely difficult to detect ; the traditional search for electroweakinos is @xmath203  @xcite , where the leptons come from cascade decays @xmath204 .",
    "as the spectrum gets squeezed , the intermediate @xmath205 go off - shell and the leptons they decay to are too soft to pass analysis cuts .",
    "current searches are restricted to on - shell @xmath205 , so there is no bound from trilepton searches on degenerate higgsinos .",
    "exactly what @xmath206 , @xmath207 mass splitting the experiments are sensitive to is a very interesting question , but beyond the scope of this paper",
    ".    a more promising way to detect degenerate higgsinos may be through monojet searches  @xcite .",
    "the initial quark / anti - quark in @xmath208 production can emit hard radiation that recoils against the invisible portion of the event .",
    "current monojet searches look for , among other physics , dark matter production after pairs of dark matter particles escape the detector .",
    "re - interpreting the monojet bounds in terms of higgsino pair production , we estimate that the current searches are sensitive to @xmath209  @xcite , competitive with the lep bound on charginos  @xcite . with more data ,",
    "this bound may increase , slicing into the parameter space of natural supersymmetry .",
    "additionally , there may be methods to optimize monojet searches for higgsinos ; the existing searches assume higher - dimensional contact operators whereas higgsinos couple directly through electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "if the natural supersymmetry expectations for @xmath183 , @xmath117 are relaxed , it is also interesting to investigate how sensitive the lhc will be to stop and sbottoms with light higgsinos .",
    "two effects arise from lowering @xmath183 and/or @xmath117 : the splittings between the higgsinos increase , and the gaugino content of the lightest electroweakinos increases . since stop and sbottom decays to higgsino - like electroweakinos",
    "are dominated by the top yukawa coupling , we do nt anticipate significant effects on the decay branching fractions even when @xmath210 drop below @xmath18 , opening up decays to gauginos .",
    "the larger effect is the increase in the splittings between the higgsinos themselves .",
    "clearly another interesting question is to probe how large the splitting needs to be before the search strategies described here become diluted by the additional energy from transitions between higgsinos .",
    "mixing the light electroweakinos with some bino , wino , or singlino is highly relevant for the possibility that the lightest neutralino could be dark matter , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "natural supersymmetry may also lead to an unusual signal for the first and second generation squarks .",
    "one decay possibility for a first / second generation squark in natural supersymmetry is to a quark plus a higgsino .",
    "as the first and second generation yukawas are so small , the decay proceeds through the wino / bino fraction of the lightest neutralino and is therefore suppressed by @xmath211 .",
    "a second decay possibility is the three - body decay , @xmath212 or @xmath213 via an off - shell gluino .",
    "this option is suppressed by the gluino mass and three - body phase space , but comes with qcd coupling strength .",
    "depending on the hierarchy of @xmath214 as well as the mass of the light squarks relative to the stops / sbottoms , the three - body decay fraction can be substantial . rather than @xmath215 , making it much smaller . ]",
    "first / second generations squark decays to @xmath216 or @xmath217 would have several consequences that would be interesting to explore in more detail .",
    "two obvious consequences are that the energy per final state particle would be lower because the squarks decay to multiple particles , and the decays would contain heavy - flavor jets not usually associated with first / second generation searches .    finally , while natural supersymmetry in a low energy effective theory is straightforward to define and quantify , issues of naturalness become muddled as this is embedded into an ultraviolet completion .",
    "the obvious issue is the that leading - log corrections to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale can quickly become a poor approximation if the renormalization group evolution is substantial .",
    "for instance , `` radiative '' electroweak symmetry breaking arises when @xmath218 is `` driven '' negative by its interaction with the stops , which clearly requires renormalization group improvement to determine the size of the contribution to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this is precisely why we considered @xmath18 and @xmath79 to be free parameters , since their separation may be much smaller than the leading - log approximation suggests .",
    "how this impacts the larger spectrum , particularly the gluino , becomes a highly model - dependent question .",

    "<S> we re - analyze the lhc bounds on light third generation squarks in natural supersymmetry , where the sparticles have masses inversely proportional to their leading - log contributions to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale . </S>",
    "<S> higgsinos are the lightest supersymmetric particles ; top and bottom squarks are the next - to - lightest sparticles that decay into both neutral and charged higgsinos with well - defined branching ratios determined by yukawa couplings and kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> the higgsinos are nearly degenerate in mass , once the bino and wino masses are taken to their natural ( heavy ) values . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three scenarios for the stop and sbottom masses : ( i ) @xmath0 is light , ( ii ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 are light , and ( iii ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are light . </S>",
    "<S> dedicated stop searches are currently sensitive to scenarios ii and iii , but not scenario i. sbottom - motivated searches ( @xmath3 ) impact both squark flavors due to @xmath4 as well as @xmath5 , constraining scenarios i and iii with somewhat weaker constraints on scenario ii . </S>",
    "<S> the totality of these searches yield relatively strong constraints on natural supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> two regions that remain are : ( 1 ) the `` compressed wedge '' , where @xmath6 , and ( 2 ) the `` kinematic limit '' region , where @xmath7-@xmath8  gev , at the kinematic limit of the lhc searches . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the correlated predictions for higgs physics , demonstrating that these regions lead to distinct predictions for the lightest higgs couplings that are separable with @xmath9 measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these conclusions remain largely unchanged once the mssm is extended to the nmssm in order to naturally obtain a large enough mass for the lightest higgs boson consistent with lhc data . </S>"
