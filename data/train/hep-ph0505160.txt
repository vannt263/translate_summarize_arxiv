    "<S> we study the line gamma ray signature from the galactic center originating from bino - like dark matter pair annihilation , when cp is not conserved . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case that the bino is nearly degenerate with a sfermion in mass . </S>",
    "<S> although an indirect detection of bino - like dark matter is difficult in general , the signal of bino - like dark matter pair annihialtion in this case is enormously enhanced due to the threshold singularity .    </S>",
    "<S> recent observations of cosmological and astrophysical quantities determine the mean density of matter and baryons in the universe precisely , and the existence of non - baryonic dark matter has now been established@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however the composition of the dark matter is still an unresolved problem . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) </S>",
    "<S> are considered to be a prominent candidate for dark matter@xcite . the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) </S>",
    "<S> provides the stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , if r - parity is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the neutralino lsp can be the dark matter due to the nature of the wimp@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the neutralino is a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge bosons ( bino and wino ) , and those of the higgs bosons ( higgsinos ) .    in many breaking scenarios , the bino - like neutralino ( @xmath0 ) </S>",
    "<S> is predicted as the lsp . </S>",
    "<S> the viable models with bino - like dark matter require the presence of mechanisms which suppress the density . </S>",
    "<S> one of the mechanism is the coannihilation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it works when there are other particles whose masses are nearly degenerate with that of the dark matter . in this case , the relic abundance of the dark matter is determined not only by its own annihilation but also by that of the slightly heavier particles , which will later decay into the dark matter . for the bino - like dark matter , the candidate for the coannihilating particle is the sfermion @xmath1 , which is the supersymmetric partner of the fermion @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> one such particleis the stau @xmath3 , and the coannihilation between bino and stau has frequently been discussed in the past works , especially in the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) . </S>",
    "<S> another example is the stop @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is considered in the context of electroweak baryogenesis in mssm . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the bino - like dark matter having @xmath5 gev mass is predicted in both cases .    </S>",
    "<S> futhermore , the effects of cp violation have been considered not only on the flavor physics but also on the dark matter physics . in dark matter physics , </S>",
    "<S> the sfermion sector is extensively studied@xcite .    for investigating the nature of the dark matter , </S>",
    "<S> many ideas for its detection are proposed and some of the experiments are now operating . among those , </S>",
    "<S> the detections of exotic cosmic ray fluxes@xcite , such as gamma rays , positrons , anti - protons and neutrinos from dark matter annihilation are feasible techniques . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an excess of monochromatic ( line ) gamma rays originating from the dark matter pair annihilation to two gammas would be a robust evidence if observed , because diffused gamma ray background must have a continuous energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the satellite detectors and the large atmospheric cerenkov telescope ( act ) arrays may search for the exotic gamma rays from the galactic center@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter , we study the line gamma ray flux from the annihilation of the bino - like dark matter which is nearly degenerate with stau or stop in mass and has cp violating interaction with those particles . </S>",
    "<S> interaction of the bino - like neutralino is so weak that the line gamma ray flux from the annihilation has been considered to be very small without cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that the annihilation cross section is enormously enhanced due to the threshold singularity when cp is violated compared to that of the cp conserved case . since the dark matter is non - relativistic ( the typical velocity is @xmath6 ) , the relevant state for the incident bino pair is @xmath7 , which is cp odd due to the majorana nature , while the sfermion pair in the @xmath7 state is cp even due to the bosonic nature . </S>",
    "<S> when cp is not conserved , the transition from the incident bino pair to a sfermion pair in the @xmath7 state takes place without the velocity suppression @xmath8 in the non - relativistic limit , and the sfermion pair can annihilate into two gammas .    </S>",
    "<S> the source of the cp violation is contained in the off - diagonal element of the mass matrix for the third generation sfermion @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the left- and right - handed sfermion masses , and @xmath14 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two higgs fields . the charge and isospin of the sfermion </S>",

    "<S> the mass matrix of stau or stop is least studied experimentally , in particular the trilinear @xmath21 or @xmath22 parameter is not constrained from stringent edm ( electric dipole moment ) experiments . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there can be a wide space in @xmath21 or @xmath22 to accommodate large cp violation .    for following discussions </S>",
    "<S> , we define the sfermion mixing matrix for diagonalizing the mass matrix , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 where we use the notation that @xmath25 has smaller mass than @xmath26 , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , @xmath25 is denoted by @xmath1 and its mass by @xmath28 for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the lightest sfermion @xmath1 is almost degenerate with @xmath0 in mass , which is needed for the coannihilation process . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that other susy particles are so heavy , in general much heavier than @xmath1 , that all the experimental constraints are satisfied in the presence of the large @xmath21 or @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the incident bino pair to the sfermion pair is caused by the yukawa interaction @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> its strength is given by the gauge coupling due to supersymmetry , @xmath30 where , @xmath31 @xmath32 is the u(1)@xmath33 gauge coupling constant of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of cp violation is induced by the relative complex phase @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the threshold singularity appears in the calculation of the annihilation cross section due to the degeneracy in mass between a bino pair and an intermediate sfermion pair and their non - relativistic motions . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate sfermion pair forms a quasi stable bound state when the binding energy is approximately equal to the mass difference , and hence the annihilation cross section is enhanced . in a feynman diagrammatic picture , </S>",
    "<S> higher order terms such as a ladder diagram depicted in fig.[diagram ] , significantly contribute to the cross section , because an intermediate sfermion pair is almost on - shell .     process . </S>",
    "<S> the character @xmath35 means gluon , which is important when @xmath2 is top . </S>",

    "<S> the schrdinger equation for the non - relativistic bino pair annihilation is derived from the nr effective lagrangian as its equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> solving the schrdinger equation is equivalent to the resummation of ladder diagrams in fig.[diagram ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the lagrangian here is essentially the same as that in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the potential @xmath47 has @xmath48 matrix form . </S>",
    "<S> the ( 1,1 ) component describes the force acting between the sfermion pair and the dominant contribution is the coulomb force for the stau case , while it comes from the qcd interaction for the stop case , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass difference between the sfermion and bino , @xmath51 for the stau case , and @xmath52 for the stop case . </S>",
    "<S> we set the fine structure constant @xmath53 , and the strong coupling @xmath54 is determined by solving the one - loop renormalization group equation at the energy @xmath55 ; @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the effective coupling at scale @xmath20 . </S>",
