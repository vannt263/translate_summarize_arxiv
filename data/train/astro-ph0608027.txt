    "there is considerable evidence that most galaxy properties , such as morphology @xcite , star formation rates @xcite , color @xcite and even luminosity function parameters ( driver , couch & phillipps 1998 ; @xcite ) correlate well with local density .",
    "it is likely that the main mechanism behind the observed correlations resides in rapid cessation of star formation in galaxies , once a threshold local density is reached ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the color - magnitude relation in the neighborhood of clusters also point to a swift change in galaxy colors once the density in the surrounding structure reaches a critical value @xcite .",
    "the environment where the transition in galaxy properties occurs , from those of typical field regions to those seen in dense clusters , is an important indicator of the evolutionary processes involved ( see e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is generally believed that most galaxy transformations ( in morphology , star formation rates and color ) take place in groups , since these are the environments where most galaxies reside and groups have sufficiently high densities , but sufficiently low velocity dispersions , that interactions and mergers may take place ( e.g. @xcite ) . indeed , compact groups are seen to populate the infall regions of the rich clusters studied by @xcite and @xcite , where the suppression of star formation and galaxy evolution appear to be taking place .",
    "other processes , such as ram pressure stripping are expected to be important only at higher densities ( e.g. abadi , moore & bower 1999 ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite show that most of the galaxies forming stars at the present epoch have relatively low luminosities and consist mostly of dwarf spirals and irregulars , while giants are mostly quiescent and tend to reside in the denser environments @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a study of the behavior of dwarf ( and intermediate luminosity ) galaxies in the group environment , together with a comparison of star - forming and quiescent galaxies may provide useful insight into the mechanisms that transform field galaxies into typical cluster members .",
    "one of the most versatile ( if simplistic ) tools for studies of galaxy population variations is the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) . the characteristic magnitude @xmath0 provides a measure of the variation of giant galaxy luminosity or mass , while the faint end slope @xmath1 can be related to the properties of the dwarf population .",
    "lfs in different wavebands , or selected according to appropriate color cuts , may be used to understand the stellar populations and star formation histories of the galaxy population under study .    in this paper",
    "we consider the variation of the galaxy lf in a sample of nearby groups spanning a wide range of masses .",
    "this topic was previously investigated by @xcite , using las campanas redshift survey data ( though this survey is now known to suffer from significant surface brightness selection effects ) , and by @xcite , who looked at three , dynamically determined , mass bins . here , we consider the entire population , split this into several group luminosity bins and consider quiescent ( red ) and star - forming ( blue ) galaxies separately , in order to explore the possible roles of mergers and star formation suppression .",
    "we mainly concentrate on the behavior of lower luminosity galaxies , i.e. on the faint end of the lf , as a function of group properties , as this is where we expect to see the strongest signature of evolutionary effects .",
    "dwarfs are believed to be fragile systems , whose properties are easily affected by dense environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we start by describing the selection of groups and the derivation of the lf parameters in section 2 , and in section 3 we discuss the observed trends and present possible interpretations of our findings .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( though this has minimal impact on our results ) and normalize distances to h@xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ( i.e. all quoted magnitudes should be read as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "the largest publicly available group sample is the 2df percolation - inferred galaxy groups ( 2pigg ) catalog @xcite , selected from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs  @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by selecting all groups from this catalogue with @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 lower limit is motivated by the small volume sampled by 2pigg at low redshift ( so that groups may not be representative ) , while at @xmath13 the 2dfgrs apparent magnitude limit begins to exclude even moderate luminosity galaxies ( @xmath14 ) from the sample .",
    "since 2pigg includes groupings as small as 2 galaxies , we also impose a minimum size of 5 members to the groups we study .",
    "this should ensure that the groups we select are likely to be actual bound physical systems .",
    "these choices leave a total of 1535 groups containing a total of 21,752 galaxies ( when corrected for completeness , as described below ) .    clearly the fainter limiting absolute magnitude for the nearer groups",
    "means that less rich groups ( in terms of giant members ) can be included at lower @xmath15 . for instance",
    ", we could in principle include groups entirely composed of dwarfs .",
    "however to minimise any effects due to this , we use only galaxies bright enough to be visible out to the edge of our survey volume ( @xmath16 ) in the estimation of the group masses . on the other hand ,",
    "exploiting the nearer groups allows us to trace galaxies @xmath17 magnitude further down the lf into the dwarf regime and hence sample some poorer groups .",
    "in fact , using only galaxies brighter than @xmath18 throughout makes no noticeable difference to our results , except in worsening the statistics for the smaller groups .",
    "we calculate absolute @xmath19 magnitudes and rest - frame @xmath20 colors for galaxies in these groups following the prescriptions of @xcite : we ignore the relatively small amount of evolution within the narrow redshift range we survey , as this correction is both small and somewhat uncertain .",
    "we calculate the group luminosity , expressed as a magnitude @xmath21 , by summing up galaxies brighter than @xmath22 ( the faintest galaxy we can detect at the highest redshift we consider ) , with weights determined by the survey spectroscopic completeness , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "this @xmath3 band group luminosity is then used as our primary indicator of group baryonic mass and thus as a proxy for the group halo mass ( see e.g.@xcite ) . note that our measure is very close to that of @xcite , who use all galaxies brighter than @xmath23 to determine group luminosities .",
    "we discuss the question of the most suitable environmental measures and proxies further in section 3 .",
    "we note here , though , that our lowest mass group environment will not be synonymous with the generic ` field ' environment .",
    "the latter is an average of groups over a whole range of ( low ) multiplicities and masses .",
    "we split our sample of groups into 10 bins of increasing total luminosity within the range equivalent to @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "bin widths are chosen so that each bin contains approximately the same total number of galaxies .",
    "this provides a much finer subdivision than used by @xcite and allows us the opportunity to search in more detail for any trends and/or transition in properties from cluster - like to field - like environments . for each of the luminosity bins we compute a composite galaxy lf , following the method described by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lfs derived for the entire sample we also create lfs for red ( quiescent ) and blue ( star - forming ) galaxies separately , adopting a color of @xmath26 at which to divide the two samples @xcite .",
    "table 1 shows the derived values of the lf parameters , together with marginal 1@xmath27 errors .",
    "most of the changes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 appear to occur in the six lowest luminosity bins , which we will focus on in our discussion .",
    "we plot the lfs for these six bins ( for all , blue and red samples ) in figures 1 ( all ) , 2 ( blue galaxies ) and 3 ( red galaxies ) and the related error ellipses in figure 4 .",
    "figure 5 summarizes the variation in lf parameters with group luminosity for each of the samples we consider . as in @xcite",
    "we find two noticeable trends in the data as a whole , viz . that @xmath0 brightens and @xmath1 steepens with increasing group mass . with the finer resolution we adopt , we are able to see that ,",
    "in fact , the lf parameter values appear to reach approximately constant levels , comparable to those seen in rich clusters @xcite , for groups brighter than @xmath28 .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour reported by @xcite and @xcite from their analysis of groups in the 2dfgrs 100k galaxy release ( with a different grouping algorithm ) and is presumably related to the observation that galaxy properties appear to change at some ` threshold ' density in the neighborhood of clusters @xcite . of course",
    ", once we reach these asymptotic values , the group luminosity which we use as a discriminator will directly mirror the richness of the group .",
    "consider each of these trends in turn .",
    "as noted above , the characteristic magnitude @xmath0 levels off ( or may even go fainter again ) for groups with magnitudes brighter than @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the value seen for these more luminous groups is similar to that seen in rich clusters , even though they start from only moderate mass groups ; assuming @xmath31 and a corresponding average universal @xmath32 ratio of 300 in solar units ( e.g. @xcite ) , they have group ( halo ) masses @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "we obtain a similar value for the mass at the ` turnover ' point , @xmath35 , if we use eke et al.s ( 2004b ) luminosity dependent mass - to - light ratios .    among the less luminous groups",
    ", there is a clear faintening of @xmath0 as one goes from intermediate to low luminosity .",
    "the dimming is seen in each left hand panel of figure 3 , though it is less clear for the blue galaxies . assuming a simple linear relation we find slopes in @xmath0 vs. @xmath21 , calculated as bisector fits of @xmath36 for the whole sample , @xmath37 for the red galaxies and @xmath38 for the blue galaxies , with goodness of fit coefficients @xmath39 of 0.983 , 0.960 and 0.717 , respectively .",
    "one could consider that this is merely a selection effect due to the enforced absence of very luminous galaxies : clearly we can not have an @xmath40 galaxy in an @xmath41 group .",
    "however , we would argue that it is still an interesting and informative exercise to determine how the available baryonic mass in a low mass group _ does _ organise itself ( i.e. the ` conditional ' lf ; see e.g. van den bosch , yang & mo 2003 ) . from figure 1 , it is clear that the mass in the small groups is still shared out in a schechter function - like distribution , but with a steadily declining bright end characteristic luminosity as we go to smaller groups .",
    "we have also tested the ` null ' hypothesis of selecting out groups with low total luminosities from sets of galaxies ( mock groups ) produced by statistically sampling a fixed lf ( both the 2dfgrs cluster lf of @xcite and the field lfs of @xcite ) . as expected",
    ", @xmath0 becomes fainter for the mock groups with low total luminosity ( due to the obvious lack of bright galaxies ) .",
    "however , these mock groups then turn out to be overpopulated with fainter objects compared to the real groups , leading to a steepening , not flattening , of the faint end slope as we go to lower mass groups .",
    "this gives us further confidence that the changes in slope we observe are real physical effects .",
    "it is more difficult to disentagle whether the change in @xmath0 is due to the effect of sampling the lf or is a real physical effect .",
    "however , though for a given small multiplicity group it is unlikely that a bright galaxy will be selected from a given purely statistical representation of the lf , once we sum over many groups , as here , the original lf will be restored ( i.e. by chance , a few groups _ will _ have a bright member ) .    note that @xcite also find a shallower slope and fainter @xmath0 for their sdss ` clusters ' with a low number of bright , red members .",
    "these objects are selected differently from our groups ( they do not use spectroscopic redshifts , as we do ) , but their figure 10 shows the same ` saturation ' of lf parameters for more massive systems as we find in our study .    indeed , the observed behaviour is in excellent agreement with that predicted by the halo occupation model of @xcite . at low group masses ( which , as here , they use group luminosity to represent ) , they find that the luminosity of the brightest galaxies should increase as @xmath42 , with a much slower increase ( slope @xmath43 ) for more massive groups .",
    "moreover , they predict that the turnover in slope should occur at group halo masses a few times @xmath44 , again in good agreement with our interpretation above ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argue that this change in behaviour occurs at the transition from efficient to inefficient cooling in different mass halos , and is the same feature required in semi - analytical modelling of galaxy formation in order to match the bright end of the overall galaxy lf ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find that the group mass - to - light ratios ( in the @xmath45 band ) as a function of group mass level off at this same point , while in the semi - analytic models of @xcite there is a trend for early type galaxies in halos above this mass to be older , redder and metal richer ( as against bluer , younger and metal poorer in the lower mass halos ) .",
    "as noted earlier , the changes appear more clearly and are larger in amplitude for the red galaxies : perhaps unsurprisingly , small groups are even more deficient in bright red galaxies than bright blue ones .",
    "even so , the generally similar trends for quiescent and star forming galaxies imply that the brightening of @xmath0 in larger groups is primarily a result of increasing galaxy masses , rather than just a variation in star formation and therefore in @xmath32 . a reasonable interpretation",
    "would then be that what we are seeing is a direct result of hierarchical growth of halos and the merging of galaxies within them ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "now consider the lf slope parameter @xmath1 .",
    "unlike @xmath0 , this is more descriptive of the moderate to low luminosity ( dwarf ) galaxy population ( though we should note that we do not sample very deep into the dwarf regime , so will be insensitive to any turn - up , as seen in some rich clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; smith , driver & phillipps 1997 ) and x - ray bright groups @xcite , below @xmath46 ) .",
    "the slope should then be less influenced by the enforced absence of giant galaxies in the smaller groups .",
    "nevertheless we again see a trend with group luminosity , with steeper slopes for the larger groups ( as in @xcite ) , and again a levelling off to the values observed for clusters once we reach @xmath29 .",
    "notice that even though @xmath1 and @xmath0 will be linked by the fitting process , we generally sample to at least 2 magnitudes below @xmath0 , so @xmath1 should genuinely measure the faint end slope .",
    "nevertheless , this parameter linkage may account for the unusually small value of @xmath1 in the lowest group luminosity bin , where we have the smallest available fitting range .",
    "recall that the low luminosity groups are not equivalent to the general field but are a more specific environment .",
    "it is therefore not necessary ( and indeed it is not the case ) that the faint end of the lf in such groups should match , or asymptotically tend to , that of the field .",
    "field , and possibly void , lfs tend to have @xmath47 in the 2df and sdss studies , rather than our shallower slope . however , the two environments are not comparable , because local densities are computed over much larger volumes than the typical field size . attempting to accommodate all the lfs with a fixed @xmath48 results in poor fits for the low luminosity groups , but even then we still see systematic changes in @xmath0 with group luminosity .",
    "again , this behaviour matches well with that prediced by @xcite from the halo occupancy statistics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they find flatter slopes ( @xmath49 ) for halos below about @xmath50 and steeper ones above that , consistent with both the direction and the crossover point we see in our variation of @xmath1 with group luminosity .",
    "the blue galaxies show a variation of @xmath1 from about @xmath51 to @xmath52 ( or even steeper ) , as previously observed for many clusters compared to the field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the red galaxies show an even greater variation , the lowest luminosity groups showing very clearly declining lfs ( @xmath53 ) at the faint end .",
    "this argues for a general shortage of dwarf early type galaxies in these low density environments , consistent with their status as the most highly clustered of all galaxy types @xcite .    now consider the physical interpretation of the variation in faint end slope .",
    "if we are assuming that the larger groups form by the hierarchical build up of smaller ones , then we might look to the same sort of merger processes that we invoked earlier in respect to the brightening of @xmath0 ( c.f .",
    "as we would expect mergers to take place most easily between the largest galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , then the bright end of the lf should build up at the expense of intermediate luminosities ( in any case , only such major mergers would substantially change the brightness of a large galaxy ) .",
    "this will then deplete the mid - section of the lf ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and therefore create a steeper faint end , by default . however , this can not be the whole picture , as the lowest luminosity groups have , in particular , rather few faint red galaxies to start with ; the change in slope of the red galaxy lf is substantially greater than that of the total sample .",
    "we therefore need to create extra faint red galaxies , the obvious source being intermediate to low luminosity late type galaxies fading and reddening due to the cutting - off of their star formation @xcite .",
    "this then reinforces the idea of reduced star formation rates in increasingly dense environments @xcite .",
    "the steepening of the lf for blue galaxies at around @xmath54 is perhaps surprisingly abrupt , but it is reminiscent of earlier claims for very steep lfs in clusters of galaxies @xcite , especially in their outskirts @xcite . conceivably this effect may be due to star formation continuing in fainter dwarfs when it has ceased in intermediate mass ones ( mimicking the global ` downsizing ' picture of cosmic star formation ; cowie et al .",
    "another intriguing possibility would be that the blue galaxies represent a new population of tidal dwarfs ( @xcite ; hunsberger , charlton and zaritsky 1996 ) , which tend to have steep luminosity functions ( hunsberger , charlton & zaritsky 1998 ) , though they are not usually thought to be as bright as the objects in our lfs .",
    "for the largest groups there may be a modest flattening of the slope again , perhaps reflecting the smaller number of dwarfs seen in some very dense environments @xcite .",
    "when attempting to interpret the observed trends , we should also consider the appropriateness of our measure of the group or cluster environment .",
    "a group s total mass is evidently a critical measure , as halo mass is the key variable in structure formation models ( @xcite _ et seq . _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "the total luminosity has been demonstrated to be a good measure of total stellar mass and total halo mass @xcite .",
    "one could argue that the total @xmath55 band luminosity would be preferable to the @xmath3 band luminosity , as it is less subject to contributions from short term star formation , and that the @xmath45 band would be better still ; @xmath45 band lfs should also more closely reflect the mass distribution of the individual group galaxies ( e.g. cole et al .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 and @xmath55 group luminosities turn out to be well correlated so experiments dividing the sample by group @xmath55 magnitudes presents the same picture as that already discussed , while @xmath45 band data is not yet available for a large enough sample to overcome statistical uncertainties ( though see @xcite for a current analysis ) .",
    "we could also divide the groups purely by multiplicity , though this will bring in additional ( or at least different ) selection effects , and theoretically is expected to have wide , poissonian , variations for a given halo mass ( e.g. @xcite ) , or by a dynamical measure such as velocity dispersion @xcite or parameters such as x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "we defer a discussion of this and of a wider range of group properties to a subsequent paper .    to sum up",
    ", the results of our study suggest that changes in the galaxy population take place mostly among the lower luminosity groups and are consistent with the changes being brought about by merger / interaction - induced accretion and star formation suppression .",
    "we have argued that the observed changes in lf parameters are not merely a selection effect due to the total available luminosity .",
    "the processes appear to be largely complete once the group luminosity reaches a threshold value @xmath56 ( with projected densities of a few giant galaxies per mpc@xmath57 ) .",
    "this is similar to earlier observations in groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "the ` threshold ' luminosity may arise during the growth of groups , when the internal velocity dispersion becomes so large as to inhibit further interactions despite the increased galaxy density . if the more massive groups then coalesce to produce clusters ( as in the hierarchical picture ) , the remarkable homogeneity in the properties of cluster galaxies observed by @xcite and @xcite would result naturally .",
