    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental gauge theory of the strong interaction based on quarks and gluons .",

    "this picture is based on the electromagnetic duality and the analogy with the one - dimensional squeezing of the magnetic flux in the type - ii superconductor . in this picture",
    ", there occurs color magnetic monopole condensation , and then the color - electric flux between the quark and the antiquark is squeezed as a one - dimensional tube due to the dual higgs mechanism . from the viewpoint of the dual - superconductor picture in qcd , however , there are two assumptions of abelian dominance @xcite and monopole condensation . here",
    ", abelian dominance means that only the diagonal gluon component plays the dominant role for the nonperturbative qcd phenomena like confinement .",
    "the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge has mainly been investigated from the viewpoint of the dual - superconductor picture @xcite and the various lattice qcd monte carlo simulations show that the ma gauge fixing seems to support these assumptions @xcite .",
    "according to these studies , the diagonal gluons seem to be significant to the infrared qcd physics , which is called  infrared abelian dominance \" .",
    "infrared abelian dominance means that off - diagonal gluons do not contribute to infrared qcd .",
    "therefore , the essence of infrared abelian dominance is the behavior of the off - diagonal gluon propagator .",
    "the gluon propagators in the ma gauge has been investigated in su(2 ) lattice monte carlo simulations @xcite . to investigate the gluon propagators in the ma gauge",
    ", it is desired to extract the gluons exactly from the link - variables , because the link - variable can not be expanded even for a small lattice spacing due to the large fluctuation of gluons . in su(2 )",
    "lattice case , the extraction is easy to be done without any approximation , because of the su(2 ) property . with this extraction , the su(2 )",
    "lattice simulation suggests that the off - diagonal gluons do not propagate in the infrared region due to the effective mass @xmath9 , while the diagonal gluon widely propagates @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a method to extract the gluons from the link - variable directly and generally in su(3 ) lattice qcd , and to investigate the gluon propagators in the ma gauge .",
    "using the su(3 ) lattice qcd , we calculate the gluon propagators in the ma gauge with the u(1)@xmath10u(1)@xmath1 landau gauge fixing . in the ma gauge , to investigate the gluon propagators , we use the gluon fields extracted directly from the link - variables @xcite . here , we analytically extract the gluon field @xmath11 from each link - variable @xmath12 as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the natural logarithm defined on complex numbers , @xmath15 is the diagonalized unitary matrix , and @xmath16 is the diagonalization unitary matrix of eigenvectors .",
