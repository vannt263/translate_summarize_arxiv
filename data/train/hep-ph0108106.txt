    "the fenice data @xcite , on the reaction close to threshold , together with earlier analogous measurements for the proton @xcite-@xcite indicate that at threshold . in other words ,",
    "the timelike form factors of the neutron and the proton are approximately equal at @xmath1 .",
    "this is a very surprizing and puzzling result and it is hard to understand in the conventional perturbative picture of baryon - antibaryon production in @xmath0 annihilation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ee - fig ] .",
    ".,width=321 ]      in the naive perturbative description of the @xmath0 annihilation into baryons , the virtual timelike photon first makes a  primary \" @xmath2 pair , which then  dresses up \" with two additional quark - antiquark pairs which pop up from the vacuum .",
    "the  dressing up \" is a qcd process , which does not distinguish between @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks , since gluon couplings are flavor - blind .",
    "thus in the conventional picture the only difference between proton and neutron is through the different electric charge of the primary @xmath2 pair .",
    "the total perturbative cross - section @xmath5 at a given _ cm _ energy is obtained by superposing the amplitudes with different flavors @xmath6 in the primary @xmath2 pair and squaring the result , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the amplitude at @xmath9 for making the baryon @xmath10 with a given the primary flavor @xmath6 .",
    "these amplitudes are determined by the baryon wavefunctions .    since the wave functions of the baryon octet have a mixed symmetry , the amplitudes @xmath8 tend to be highly asymmetric .",
    "thus for example in the chernyak - zhitnitsky proton wave function @xcite the @xmath3 quark dominates , i.e. @xmath11 , @xmath12 and similarly @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "in such a limiting case we have @xmath15 while this is an extreme case , on general grounds we expect that @xmath3 dominates in the proton and @xmath4 in the neutron , so @xmath16 , intuitively one can understand this perturbative result directly from fig .",
    "[ ee - fig ] , by recalling that the average charge squared of quarks in the proton is higher than in the neutron .",
    "thus the naive perturbation theory clearly disagrees with the experimental result @xcite .          as the first step , one has to realize that we are dealing with a highly nonperturbative process .",
    "even though the are measured at a momentum transfer which is much higher than @xmath17 , , we are very far from the perturbative regime .",
    "the reason is that all the available energy is very quickly divided among the quarks and antiquarks in the @xmath18 system .",
    "since the total available energy is very close to the rest mass of the @xmath18 system , none of the quarks has any  spare \" momentum .",
    "there have been several attempts to explain the fenice data by various theoretical proposals utilizing specific nonperturbative mechanisms ( for a recent report on some of this work see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but to the best of my knowledge , so far there is no satisfactory explanation in terms of conventional mechanisms or their straightforward extensions .",
    "the lack of such a conventional theoretical explanation is part of the motivation for the proposed new asymmetrical @xmath19 high - statistics collider at slac for the regime @xmath20 gev @xcite .",
    "this machine will yield high - precision data on baryon production in @xmath19 annihilation at threshold , providing a check on the fenice data and an accurate benchmark for testing possible theoretical explanations .    in this context",
    "it is amusing to note the perturbation theory predictions for the @xmath21 baryon resonance multiplet production in @xmath0 near threshold .",
    "since the @xmath21 has a totally symmetric wave function , the corresponding amplitudes are equal , @xmath22 , for all 4 members of the multiplet , @xmath23 .",
    "thus perturbation theory makes a striking prediction for the neutral member of the multiplet , @xmath24 more generally , the relative yields predicted by perturbation theory are @xmath25",
    "the fenice puzzle is reinforced by the cleo data on baryon - antibaryon production in photon - photon collisions @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cleo - gg - fig ] ( see also @xcite and @xcite for related experimental work ) .",
    "cleo has compared the @xmath27 cross - sections for @xmath28 and @xmath29 production and they find that close to threshold .",
    "this is quite similar to the fenice puzzle for the @xmath30 ratio . the naive perturbative description of the baryon - production in the photon - photon reaction is given by the feynman diagram in fig .  [ gg - fig ] . since there are two photons here , instead of one in fig",
    "[ ee - fig ] , for each flavor of the primary @xmath31 pair the corresponding amplitude scales like the quark charge squared , to be compared with linear dependence of the amplitudes on the quark charge in the @xmath0 case .",
    "thus one would naively expect the ratio @xmath32 to be even larger than the corresponding perturbative prediction for @xmath33 in @xmath0 .",
    ".,width=188 ]    the disagreement between the naive theoretical prediction and experiment is striking again .    just like in the fenice case , despite several , there is no satisfactory theoretical explanation for this cleo data ( for example , see @xcite for a recent theoretical analysis of @xmath34 in terms of di - quarks ) .",
    "it would be highly interesting to see the data for @xmath35 close to threshold , but such analysis has not yet been done due to some technical difficulties @xcite .",
    "as will be clear from the following discussion , close to threshold we expect the @xmath35 cross - section be the same as @xmath36 .",
    "we urge our experimental colleagues to carry out such an analysis .",
    "the perturbative ratios are even more dramatic for the rates for @xmath37 , which are proportional to the fourth power of the @xmath21 electric charge , if one has symmetric wavefunctions .",
    "thus for  @xmath38 near threshold , the analogue of eq .",
    "[ dyieldspt ] is @xmath39 as we shall discuss in more detail in the following section , the mechanism we propose for this type of reactions predicts a completely different result .",
    "in view of these fenice and cleo puzzles , we have proposed @xcite a novel mechanism which might explain the data .",
    "the essential new point in the proposed is that it is a two - stage process , with a coherent state of pions serving as an intermediary between @xmath0 and the baryon - antibaryon system , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ pions - fig ] .     as a two - stage process , where @xmath0 annihilate into a timelike photon which first couples to an intermediate pion state , which then produces the @xmath18 pair.,width=302 ]      we propose to use the skyrme model as a concrete computational framework for a quantitative description of the baryon - antibaryon dynamics . in the skyrme model",
    "@xcite,@xcite baryons appear as solitons in a purely bosonic chiral lagrangian .",
    "the model is formally justified as a low - energy approximation to large-@xmath40 qcd @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is known to provide a good description of many low - energy properties of baryons ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it turns out that it is also possible to obtain a fairly accurate description of low - energy baryon - antibaryon annihilation in terms of skyrmion - antiskyrmion annihilation @xcite-@xcite . instead of asking how a  @xmath29  or  @xmath41  configuration is formed by a virtual timelike photon , or by two photons ,",
    "it is conceptually easier to consider the reverse processes , i.e. or  , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ pions1-fig ] , and the analogous processes for two photons .",
    ", i.e. @xmath42 as a two - stage process , where the nucleons first annihilate into pions , which then couple to a a timelike photon to produce the @xmath0 pair.,width=302 ]    it is interesting to note that it has been argued  @xcite that in perturbation theory the production of extended , such as a soliton - antisoliton configuration , by pointlike particles , such as in @xmath0 annihilation , is suppressed by a large exponential factor @xmath43 .",
    "thus the fact that the reaction @xmath44 has been measured with a small , but finite cross - section is yet another indication of the nonperturbative nature of the process .    following the pioneering numerical work of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we now have the following picture of the @xmath45 annihilation at rest as a skyrmion anti - skyrmion annihilation : just after the skyrmion and anti - skyrmion touch , they  unravel \" each other , and a classical pion wave emerges as a coherent burst and takes away energy and baryon number as quickly as causality permits .",
    "this observation led the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to suggest the following simplified version of @xmath45 annihilation at rest .",
    "after a very fast annihilation a spherically symmetric `` blob '' of pionic matter of size @xmath46  fm , baryon number zero and the total energy twice the nucleon rest mass is formed .",
    "the further evolution of the system and the branching rates of various channels are completely determined by the parameters of this `` blob '' .    for a very crude toy model of what is going on ,",
    "let s assume that  @xmath29 annihilate into two pions which then go to  @xmath0  via a timelike photon ,    @xmath47    clearly , the real process involves an intermediate state with a a much larger number of pions on the average , but two pions are sufficient to understand why within this physical picture we expect the @xmath48 rate to be the same as the @xmath49 rate rate .",
    "the basic argument is that since we have a two - stage process , the crucial issue is the rate @xmath50 vs. the rate @xmath51 . since this is a purely strong interaction process , we expect the two rates to be equal .",
    "the next step is @xmath52 which of does not care whether the pions were produced by @xmath29 or @xmath41 annihilation .",
    "clearly if  @xmath53  has the same cross - section as @xmath54 , the same will apply to the reverse processes .",
    "it is tempting to assume that a similar argument can be made for @xmath55  vs. @xmath56 , although one expects the corresponding analysis to be more difficult , as one will have @xmath57 in the intermediate state .",
    "we should stress that the two pion intermediate state is used here only as an illustration . in practice",
    "the two pion channel is very small and most difficult to treat within the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , since the semiclassical approximation is best suited for coherent states .",
    "a similar comment applies to a possible calculation of @xmath18 annihilation into two photons @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath58 , one can also carry out an analogous analysis for @xmath59 .",
    "the relative yields of @xmath60 and @xmath61 will be determined by the relevant clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite and by the corresponding reduced matrix elements for isospin 1 and 0 .",
    "we do not know the precise values of these reduced matrix elements , but even without this information , from the clebsch - gordan decomposition we expect @xmath62 as opposed to the perturbative prediction ( [ dyieldspt ] ) .",
    "( [ brratios ] ) hold also for @xmath63 , since @xmath64 , etc .",
    ", to be contrasted with the perturbative prediction ( [ ggdyieldspt ] ) . it would be very interesting to put this to an experimental test !",
    "it is not enough to propose a mechanism which can explain the equality of the observed @xmath29 and @xmath41 rates .",
    "we also have to explain why the proposed mechanism dominates over the standard one .",
    "after all , the reaction can in principle still proceed via the usual naive perturbative mechanism , where quarks couple directly to the virtual photon , like in fig .",
    "[ ee - fig ] , and where the @xmath65 thus a crucial question is why  @xmath53  or   @xmath53 proceed via intermediate hadronic states , rather than via direct em annihilation . in order to answer this question , it is helpful to consider the relevant time scales .    consider  @xmath29 on top of each other at rest .",
    "the qcd annihilation occurs at a typical time scale of strong interactions , i.e. @xmath66 sec .",
    "this is much shorter than a typical time scale for em interactions , so that the  direct \" qed process , where  @xmath2 in the  @xmath29 annihilate into a virtual photon simply has no chance of occurring : qed here is a  johnny come lately \" who can not compete with the qcd rate .",
    "qed enters only at the second stage , where the mesonic  soup \" has a ( small ) chance of going into a virtual photon .",
    "but here we are concerned with the _ relative _ rate of @xmath29  vs.  @xmath41 , so the overall smallness of the qed process @xmath67 is not a priori a problem .",
    "the two - pion intermediate state is of course only a toy model which is helpful in understanding the qualitative features of the reaction . in order to obtain a more more realistic description ,",
    "we need to put in a more realistic intermediate state .",
    "the first improvement would be to include intermediate states with @xmath68 pions , where @xmath68 goes over all allowed values , @xmath69    in principle one could compute the @xmath70 rates using the methods of ref .",
    "it is not clear how to obtain the relative phases for different values of @xmath68 , but if one of the intermediate states dominates , this problem will not be of practical significance",
    ".    a more sophisticated treatment will involve summing over all allowed intermediate states , not just the @xmath68-@xmath71 . in principle",
    "this could be done by combining the low - energy @xmath72 data with the corresponding data for @xmath73 annihilation at rest .",
    "one would then sum them channel by channel .",
    "there are very precise data from lear for @xmath73 annihilation a rest and there are also good data for @xmath72 .",
    "recently the vepp-2 m collider at novosibirsk provided highly accurate @xmath0 data for @xmath74  gev @xcite , with excellent finite state resolution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vepp - fig ] .",
    "this energy range is below what we need , but it shows the expected richness of the data . if similar data can be obtained for @xmath75 gev , they could be combined with the lear data to provide an estimate of the @xmath76 rate through our mechanism .    again , one remaining difficulty is the issue of relative phases , but as already mentioned , if the intermediate state is dominated but one particular channel , the phase issue will not be of practical significance .",
    "clearly , what is presented here is merely a sketch of the proposed calculation , and in order to convince oneself that it correctly describes the physics , one should actually put in the rates for the relevant intermediate processes , in order to provide a theoretical estimate which can be compared with the measured rate for @xmath77  or @xmath78 .",
