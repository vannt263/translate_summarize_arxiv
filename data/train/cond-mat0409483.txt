    "considerably improved characteristics of the electron analysers used in modern angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) together with the accumulated experience in photoemission on superconducting cuprates @xcite as well as recent success in clarification of the underlying electronic structure @xcite have led to understanding that a careful analysis of the lineshape of photoemission spectra @xcite is needed to clarify the origin of the main interaction which is responsible for the pairing mechanism .",
    "the nodal direction in the brillouin zone ( bz ) of superconducting cuprates , being responsible for their conducting properties , is of a special importance .",
    "while the pronounced doping dependence of the quasiparticle spectral weight in the antinodal region of the bz unambiguously points to a magnetic origin of the strong electron - boson coupling seen by arpes @xcite , the nodal direction , where the famous `` kink '' on the renormalized dispersion @xcite has been shown to persists in the whole doping range @xcite , is a subject of unresolved controversy between phonon @xcite and spin - fluctuation @xcite scenarios .",
    "recently we have shown that the spectral weight of electronic excitations detected by arpes along the nodal direction can be self - consistently described within the quasiparticle self - energy approach @xcite . with the suggested procedure",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy in a wide frequency range as well as the bare band dispersion can be uniquely determined .",
    "we have shown that the procedure is applicable to an underdoped bi-2212 in the pseudo - gap state and determined a number of correlation parameters for that sample .",
    "here we give a detailed description of the procedure , discussing its limitations and physical consequences .",
    "we derive the relations of the quasiparticle self - energy with the parameters of photoemission spectra , demonstrate self - consistency of the procedure and its robustness in determination of the bare band dispersion , examine the possible influence of a particle - hole asymmetry , discuss a necessity of clear definition of the `` kink '' , and demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach for other samples : an overdoped bi(pb)-2212 and optimally doped bi(la)-2201 .",
    "we start with a definition of the spectral function within the self - energy approach : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the bare band dispersion and @xmath2 is a quasiparticle self - energy , an analytical function the real and imaginary parts of which are related by the kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformation @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "within such a definition , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "it is instructive to express some interaction parameters via both self - energy functions .",
    "for example , the coupling strength @xmath8 , which can be defined as @xmath9 can be expressed in terms of @xmath10 differentiating the kk relation ( [ kk ] ) : @xmath11 here we used the fact that adding some constant to @xmath12 in ( [ kk ] ) does not change the result .",
    "then , for an even @xmath13 , @xmath14    eq .  ( [ lambda ] ) gives a certain feeling how @xmath13 function influences @xmath8 .",
    "for example , for a simple case @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an energy cut - off and @xmath17 is an offset , eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) gives @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "as we show below , the different but reasonable tails of  @xmath13 ( at @xmath20 ) almost do not effect the experimentally determined @xmath21 ratio , i.e.  influence of the high energy region on @xmath8 can be described by only one parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "+     the self - energy approach can be applied to the nodal spectra analysis ( e.g. , see refs .  )",
    "as far as the seed dispersion in ( [ a ] ) along the nodal direction is identical to be the bare electron dispersion , not affected by either superconducting gap or pseudo - gap opening .",
    "modern arpes measures the photocurrent intensity of outgoing electrons , @xmath23 , which is the quasiparticle spectral weight ( the quasiparticle spectral function @xmath24 multiplied by the fermi - function @xmath25 ) slightly modified by matrix elements , @xmath26 , energy and momentum resolutions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and an extrinsic background @xmath29 : @xmath30 it is peculiar for all cuprates , and especially for bi - cuprates , that the matrix elements variation with @xmath31 along the nodal direction is negligible @xcite and that the extrinsic background is @xmath31-independent @xcite , thus can be easily subtracted .",
    "the energy and momentum resolutions produce rather small effect which we discuss later .",
    "so , the photocurrent intensity with subtracted background is simply proportional to the quasiparticle spectral weight , and the question is whether it can be completely described by eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) .    the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) is believed to be momentum independent along the nodal direction , or at least much less dependent than on frequency : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the bare fermi velocity .",
    "this assumption is supported by a perfect lorentzian lineshape of the momentum distribution curves ( mdc s , mdc(@xmath31 ) = @xmath34 ) @xcite , although it has been pointed out @xcite that a linear @xmath31-dependence of @xmath35 is a more general case which leads to the lorentzian lineshape of mdc s .",
    "we will discuss a possibile @xmath31-dependence of @xmath35 below .    as long as mdc s",
    "are lorentzians , two quantities at each frequency can be derived from the experimental data : the mdc width , @xmath36 ( defined as the half width at half maximum ) , and the mdc peak position , @xmath37 , which is thus an inverse function to the renormalized dispersion . in the vicinity of the fermi level one can consider the bare dispersion as linear , and the relations between the self - energy parts and these experimentally determined functions are especially simple @xcite : @xmath38,\\\\ \\label{ims0 } \\sigma''(\\omega)&= & -v_f w(\\omega).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath39 is a priori unknown , the system ( [ res0])-([ims0 ] ) is incomplete .",
    "one can complete the system by eq .",
    "( [ kk ] ) but encountering a problem of `` tails '' , the high energy behavior of @xmath13 that is also unknown .",
    "for example , using another ultimate model for @xmath10-tails , @xmath40 which approximates the saturation of scattering rate at high frequencies , one obtains @xmath41 instead of ( [ lambda_sim ] ) .    in the next section",
    "we show that this problem can be partially solved considering a finite frequency range available from arpes experiments . for this range ,",
    "however , the deviation of the bare dispersion from linear becomes essential , therefore , we approximate it by a parabola @xmath42 , which fits well to the band dispersion in given direction obtained within the tight - binding model @xcite . here",
    "@xmath43 is the bottom of the bare band . within this approximation , the eqs .",
    "( [ res0 ] ) and ( [ ims0 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath44 , \\\\",
    "\\label{ims1}\\sigma''(\\omega ) & = & \\frac{2\\,\\omega_0}{k_f^2}\\ , w(\\omega ) \\sqrt{k_m^2(\\omega)-w^2(\\omega)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the fitting machinery is based on eqs .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) , ( [ ims1 ] ) and ( [ kk ] ) . one can define three steps here . in the two first , the real part of the self - energy , for given @xmath45 , @xmath22 and @xmath46 ( which characterizes the tails , see below ) , is calculated in two ways : ( i ) @xmath47 by eq .",
    "( [ res1 ] ) ; ( ii ) @xmath48 by eq .",
    "( [ ims1 ] ) with subsequent kk transform ( [ kk ] ) .",
    "then , in step ( iii ) , the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath22 and @xmath46 are varied until @xmath49 and @xmath50 coincide . in practice , we fit the difference @xmath51 to a small contribution of experimental resolution .",
    "the calculation of @xmath48 deserves to be considered in details . in order to perform a kk transform ,",
    "high - energy tails should be attached to @xmath13 derived from eq .",
    "( [ ims1 ] ) .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) represent two extremes which can be enclosed in a simple analytical expression : @xmath52 as the ultimate cases with @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively . for given @xmath46 and @xmath22",
    ", we construct @xmath13 function in a wide frequency range ( up to @xmath55 or higher ) assuming the particle - hole symmetry : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a `` confidence limit '' , a maximal experimental binding energy to which both the @xmath36 and @xmath37 functions can be confidently determined , @xmath58 is calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ ims1 ] ) for given @xmath45 , @xmath59 is fitted to @xmath58 in the confidence range in order to define @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath50 by kk transform ( [ kk ] ) .",
    "[ tails ] shows the pairs of @xmath13 and @xmath62 functions obtained in such a way for the same @xmath45 but for three different models : ( [ s1 ] ) , ( [ s2 ] ) , and ( [ s3 ] ) with @xmath63 ( dashed , dotted , and solid lines respectively ) .",
    "since @xmath64 , in order to simplify numerical calculation , the offset of @xmath13 curves is set to @xmath65 .",
    "the experimental data are taken for an underdoped bi(pb)-2212 ( ud77 , @xmath66 77 k ) at 130 k and the fitting result for which @xmath67 ev is represented by solid - line @xmath62 @xcite .    in step ( iii ) , as we mentioned above , the difference @xmath68 should be fitted not to zero but to some small but detectable contribution of the overall resolution @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this difference can be easily understood by reasoning that finite energy and angular resolutions mainly effect the mdc s width rather than its peak position and that its contribution is frequency dependent . in order to illustrate this",
    "we can take into account the overall resolution , @xmath70 , as @xmath71",
    ". then one can consider its frequency dependent contribution to the imaginary part of @xmath72 as the difference between @xmath58 and real @xmath13 : @xmath73 and , due to additivity of the kk - transform , @xmath74 , construct @xmath75-dependent contribution to @xmath48 as @xmath76    although , in principle , the resolution effect @xmath69 can be explicitely calculated from known energy and momentum resolutions , here we derive it empirically using @xmath70 as a parameter .",
    "it is seen from fig .  [ tails ] that different tails do not affect the energy region @xmath77 0.25 ev , so , an irreducible difference in the slopes ( see fig .  [ ress ] ) @xmath78 in the low energy range @xmath77 0.07 ev ( while @xmath79 at higher energies 0.1 ev @xmath80 0.2 ev ) is a measure of @xmath69 .    in fig .",
    "[ ress ] we plot @xmath69 setting the offset of @xmath13 to zero that gives the value of @xmath70 = 0.015 ev .",
    "for @xmath81 the procedure gives larger @xmath70 values to accommodate the difference in slopes but this does not affect the fact that the irreducible difference between @xmath50 and @xmath49 is caused by the experimental resolution , and depends on frequency like it is shown in fig .  [ ress ] : it vanishes at zero and high frequencies having a maximum around 0.1 ev .",
    "thus , we can visualize the fitting procedure as fitting the difference @xmath82 to @xmath69 function .",
    "the procedure has appeared to be robust with respect to the @xmath45 determination .",
    "[ ress ] illustrates this .",
    "first three panels show that for a correct value of @xmath67 ev there is space for other parameters to vary : different tails can be compensated by different @xmath22 s , e.g. , for @xmath83 3 , 4 and 6 in eq .",
    "[ s3 ] , @xmath84 , 0.45 and 0.52 ev respectively . on the other hand , at slightly different @xmath45 s ( about 10% lower and higher , see two right panels ) , @xmath82 can not be fitted to @xmath69 in the whole frequency range .",
    "in ref .  , as mentioned above , we have applied the technique to underdoped bi(pb)-2212 , ud77 , in the pseudo - gap state ( at 130 k ) . here",
    "we present some other examples .",
    "[ results]a shows the results for an overdoped bi(pb)-2212 , od75 , at 130 k. here , in order to check the correctness of the kk numerics , we also plot @xmath85 function which is obtained by back kk - transform ( [ kk2 ] ) of @xmath50 .",
    "the parameters for this fit are : @xmath86 ev , @xmath87 ev , @xmath88 . in case of the od sample ,",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath46 are better determined because of a higher confidence limit @xmath57 = 0.45 ev at which one can see that @xmath13 starts to saturate .",
    "we note that the lower value of @xmath45 compared to the underdoped sample is in agreement with the rigid band approximation .",
    "the demonstrated self - consistency of the analyzed data shows , besides the applicability of the self - energy approach to superconducting cuprates , that the measured spectra belong to a single band and are free of influence of any additional features like other bands , superstructure or @xmath31-dependent background .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that although the electronic dispersion along the nodal direction in the bi - layer bi-2212 is not degenerated , i.e.  has a finite splitting about 0.05 ev for the bare dispersion , the photoemission from the bonding band is highly suppressed at exactly 27 ev excitation energy . at other energies",
    "we do not expect that the described fitting procedure will work until the contributions of each band can be separated .",
    "[ results]b demonstrates this showing the `` best '' fitting result that can be achieved for @xmath89 38 ev .",
    "the difference between @xmath82 and @xmath69 is apparent .",

    "we believe that the described procedure gives a powerful technique to purify the arpes data from artificial features and to build a strong experimental basis for understanding of the nature of electronic interactions in cuprates , but still a big work on the data analysis should be performed .",
    "nevertheless , some conclusions can be made even on this stage .",
    "it is interesting to note that even for ud77 sample , for which the saturation of @xmath13 has not been observed , it is not possible to reconcile the high - energy behavior of @xmath13 with the saturation extreme ( [ s2 ] ) [ or ( [ s3 ] ) with @xmath54 ] .",
    "this means that @xmath94 reaches the maximum and starts to decrease at about @xmath22 , and , consequently , @xmath62 changes the sign at approximately the same frequency ( see fig .",

    "recently @xcite , it has been noticed that the necessary condition for the lorentzian lineshape is @xmath97 , but @xmath98 can be an @xmath75-independent constant .",
    "this is especially interesting because the authors of ref .",
    "have shown that such a linear @xmath31-dependence of @xmath35 can explain a non - trivial doping - dependent high - energy dispersion observed for a variety of cuprates @xcite .    as long as @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath31-dependence of @xmath35",

    ", one can expect an asymmetry of the self - energy due to an asymmetric electron - boson interaction or as a simple consequence of asymmetric density of states . without considering the origin of the asymmetry",
    ", we examine its possible influence based on the energy scale where it can appear .",
    "it is well known that because of the possibility to perform arpes at finite temperature one can get the information about quasiparticle spectral weight not only below the chemical potential but also from some region above @xcite . for @xmath103 = 300 k",
    "the mdc width can be measured up to 50 mev above @xmath104 , and , within the experimental uncertainty , it has appeared to be completely symmetric ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that if there is some asymmetry in the scattering rate at low energy scale ( @xmath105 0.1 ev , a characteristic scale which can originate from an electron - boson interaction or from the van hove singularity in the occupied density of states of the hole - doped cuprates ) , its magnitude is too small to be seen in the @xmath77 50 mev energy range and , consequently , hardly effects the quasiparticle renormalization in the occupied region ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "[ asymmetry ] illustrates this : the dashed curves , on top of the symmetric self - energy shown by shaded areas , represent a low - energy asymmetric contribution which is too big not to be noticed in @xmath13 ( for @xmath77 50 mev ) but too small to influence @xmath106 .",
    "the solid curves in fig .  [ asymmetry ]",
    "present the case of high - energy asymmetry that can steam from the asymmetry of the bare band @xcite .",
    "we simulate it by an asymmetry part in the scattering rate : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is determined by ( [ s3 ] ) with @xmath96 = 0.45 ev , @xmath109 = 0.66 ev , @xmath63 , @xmath110 .",
    "it is seen that although the influence of @xmath111 on renormalization at @xmath112 ev @xmath113 ev is rather small ( can be approximated at this stage by a linear contribution with a slope of about 20% of @xmath8 ) it can be , in principle , detected by more precise analysis , in which the influence of the energy and angular resolutions is taken into account explicitly .",
    "the real parts of the self - energy for ud77 and od75 samples at 130 k : solid lines show the result of fitting these real parts to ( [ kink_function ] ) in a frequency range 0.17 ev @xmath113 for ud77 and 0.12 ev @xmath113 for od75 ; looking down arrows mark @xmath62 maxima ; the dashed line denotes the 70 mev `` kink '' energy.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ kinks ] we plot together the real parts of the self - energy for ud77 and od75 samples at 130 k. just from visual comparison of these data one can conclude that : ( i ) the renormalization for ud77 is considerably higher than for od75 ; ( ii ) the energy of the maximum of @xmath62 for the overdoped sample is lower than for the underdoped sample , it is about two times closer to the 70 mev `` kink '' energy ; ( iii ) the kink feature is well defined in the underdoped case and becomes weaker with overdoping .    following this tendency one can expect that with overdoping the 70 mev kink vanishes while the renormalization maximum moves to lower frequencies faking a persistence of the kink in the whole doping range .",
    "therefore , it is clear that in order to clarify the origin of the kink feature a quantitative measure of it is required .    keeping the visual definition of the kink as a sharp bend of the renormalized dispersion",

    "we believe that a systematic study of this or similar quantitaties as a function of doping and temperature will help to find the origin of the main electronic interaction in superconducting cuprates .",
