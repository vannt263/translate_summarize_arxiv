    "virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) is a suitable tool to obtain information on the internal structure of a system .",
    "compared to real compton scattering ( rcs ) , the vcs reaction contains much more information because of the independent variation of energy and momentum transfer to the target and the additional longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "in particular , vcs off the pseudoscalar meson octet ( @xmath1 , k , @xmath2 ) is of theoretical interest , since the pseudoscalar mesons can be identified with the goldstone bosons of qcd which arise from the spontaneous symmetry breakdown from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .    for a low - energy outgoing real photon",
    ", the vcs amplitude can be parametrized in terms of generalized polarizabilities @xcite which give information about the response of the target to a quasi - static electromagnetic field .",
    "these observables are functions of the square of the virtual photon four - momentum , @xmath5 , and reduce in the limit of @xmath6 to the standard electric ( @xmath7 ) and magnetic ( @xmath8 ) polarizabilities of real compton scattering .",
    "the vcs amplitude of mesons can be investigated experimentally through inelastic scattering of mesons ( @xmath9 ) off atomic electrons , @xmath10 . in the case of the pion",
    ", such an experiment has been performed by the selex collaboration at fermilab @xcite .",
    "other experiments to determine the pion polarizabilities are presently under analysis or planned at several facilities @xcite .",
    "in addition , experiments to measure the kaon polarizabilities have been proposed at cern @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the vcs reaction for pions and kaons in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) at @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we give a short survey of chpt , and in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] we discuss our predictions for the vcs amplitude . in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] , we present our results for the generalized pion and kaon polarizabilities in comparison with different model calculations . in sec .  [ section5 ] we show predictions for the cross section of electron - pion bremsstrahlung , discussing the possibility to extract information about the generalized polarizabilities .",
    "finally , a short summary and some conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ section6 ] .",
    "we assume that the @xmath11 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian in the chiral limit , i.e. , vanishing u- , d- , and s - quark masses , is spontaneously broken down to @xmath4 @xcite , giving rise to eight massless pseudoscalar goldstone bosons with vanishing interactions in the limit of zero energy @xcite .",
    "these goldstone bosons can be identified with the pseudoscalar meson octet , the non - zero mass resulting from an explicit symmetry breaking in qcd through the quark masses .",
    "the interactions of the pseudoscalar mesons can be described using the effective chiral lagrangian @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath13 refers to the order in the so - called momentum expansion .",
