    "secant varieties have received growing attention in recent times , largely because of the fact that they provide a geometric model relevant to a wide variety of applications .",
    "the purpose of this note is to provide a case study in finding equations of secant varieties . for an introduction to secant varieties and their applications",
    "we invite the reader to consult @xcite and the vast collection of references therein .",
    "the 5 factor binary secant variety is particularly interesting in light of recent results of bocci and chiantini @xcite , that @xmath3 tensors are not identifiable in rank 5 , but the generic tensor of that format has exactly 2 decompositions . for @xmath4 factors ,",
    "the binary segre product is known to be @xmath5-identifiable for most of the possible values of @xmath5 below the generic rank , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "fix a field @xmath6 of characteristic @xmath7 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "let @xmath9 be a @xmath0-dimensional vector space over @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the @xmath12th secant variety of @xmath13 inside of @xmath14 ( by the segre embedding ) .",
    "the goal of this note is to prove the following statement .",
    "[ thm : ci ] the affine cone of @xmath11 is a complete intersection of two equations : one of degree @xmath1 , and one of degree @xmath2 .    we speculate that the homogeneous coordinate ring of any secant variety of any segre product of projective spaces is cohen  macaulay .",
    "theorem  [ thm : ci ] confirms this for @xmath11 . using flattening and inheritance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  7 ) , we get the following corollary :    [ cor : eqns ] suppose @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be vector spaces , let @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote minimal generators of @xmath19 and let @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , denote the natural liftings of @xmath17 and @xmath18 to @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath11 be the fifth secant variety of @xmath23 then the linear span of the @xmath24-orbits of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are equations that vanish on @xmath11 .",
    "a _ flattening _ of a tensor @xmath25 is a matrix constructed by viewing @xmath26 as a linear mapping from the dual of one subset of the 5 vector spaces to the complementary subset .",
    "the basic fact is that if @xmath26 has rank @xmath27 , then a flattening @xmath28 has rank @xmath29 .",
    "so when non - trivial , the @xmath30 minors of flattenings provide equations of secant varieties . in our case the only possible sizes of flattenings are ( up to transpose ) @xmath31 , or @xmath32 , with maximum ranks @xmath0 and @xmath33 respectively , so they do not provide non - trivial equations for tensors of rank @xmath12 .",
    "a next source for equations of secant varieties are exterior ( or koszul ) flattenings ( see , for instance , @xcite ) or , more generally , young flattenings @xcite . for basic background , we invite the reader to consult @xcite . the basic idea of young flattenings is to consider cases when the tensor product of a schur module @xmath34 with @xmath35 contains another schur module @xmath36 , i.e. , we have a linear map @xmath37 depending linearly on @xmath38 .",
    "subadditivity of matrix rank implies that if @xmath39 has rank @xmath40 when @xmath26 has rank @xmath41 then @xmath39 has rank at most @xmath42 when @xmath26 has rank @xmath27 .",
    "the art in this approach is to find good pairs of multi - partitions so that the dimensions of @xmath43 and @xmath36 are large with respect to @xmath40 , so that the young flattening has a chance to detect high rank tensors . in principle",
    "it is possible , but tedious , to list all possible young flattenings and check which have a chance to provide meaningful equations .",
    "because @xmath44 are all @xmath0-dimensional , there are not too many choices for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , however our initial tries at finding young flattenings that give non - trivial equations for the 5th secant variety were unsuccessful , and it seems that young flattenings do not provide equations for this secant variety .    after looking for young flattenings unsuccessfully , we attempted a systematic search for equations via interpolation informed by representation theory .",
    "our approach relied on computer calculations , which we explain in  [ sec : eqn ] .",
    "the search for the equation of degree @xmath1 is rigorous , but the search for the degree @xmath2 equation is only correct up to high probability since we only show that it vanishes on sufficiently many pseudo - random points .",
    "our search for equations was guided by our guess that this variety , having low codimension , would be defined by just a few equations , and because of the large symmetry group , that these equations would be semi - invariants .",
    "our guesses are validated in  [ sec : proof ] , where we use these equations and one additional computer calculation on the degree of @xmath11 ( which is also only valid up to high probability ) to deduce theorem  [ thm : ci ] . in  [ sec : complement ] we provide a more detailed version of corollary  [ cor : eqns ] from a @xmath47-module ( in the sense of @xcite ) point of view .",
    "in particular , the equations that we find provide modules of equations for all other @xmath12th secant varieties of segre products , both when the dimensions of the factors increase ( by `` inheritance '' ) and when the number of factors increase ( by flattening ) . as far as we know these equations do not come from any known construction ( such as young flattenings ) , so they provide interesting new classes of equations for secant varieties .",
    "we thank bernd sturmfels for suggesting this problem , j.m .",
    "landsberg for helpful discussions , and jon hauenstein for providing bertini help .",
    "the software bertini @xcite , macaulay2 @xcite and maple were helpful for this work .",
    "both authors acknowledge the hospitality of the simons institute for the theory of computing in berkeley where this work was carried out .",
    "ss was supported by a miller research fellowship .",
    "the variety @xmath11 that we are studying has low codimension so we expect its ideal to be cut out by few equations .",
    "in addition , the defining ideal of @xmath11 has a large symmetry group .",
    "if one polynomial is in the ideal of @xmath11 , then so is the entire vector space of polynomials in the span of its orbit .",
    "so we expect @xmath11 to be cut out by a small number of semi - invariant polynomials . in this section",
    "we describe how we use all available symmetry to cut down our search for equations .",
    "choose a basis @xmath48 for @xmath9 so that we can identify the coordinates of @xmath14 with @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the polynomial ring @xmath52 $ ] and let @xmath53 be the ideal of equations vanishing on @xmath11 . since @xmath51 is graded , @xmath54 , and we can compute @xmath55 for each @xmath56 .",
    "the most naive approach to determining @xmath57 is to evaluate a basis of @xmath58 on @xmath59 points of @xmath11 using the parametrization of @xmath11 , store the results in a matrix @xmath60 and compute the kernel @xmath61 . in practice",
    "we use pseudo - random points on @xmath11 with rational coefficients .    in exact arithmetic",
    ", non - vanishing is a certainty , but vanishing might yield a false - positive .",
    "so this test gives an upper bound for @xmath62 and a probabilistic lower bound .",
    "the confidence in the lower bound may be increased by evaluating on more points of @xmath11 .",
    "alternatively , one can work over a function field over @xmath6 of large enough transcendence degree ( i.e. , use parametrized points ) where vanishing yields a genuine equation .",
    "the downside is that such computations are more expensive .",
    "this approach only works for small values of @xmath56 as the dimension of @xmath58 grows quickly .",
    "in particular , one can use it for @xmath63 ( the lowest possible degree in which the equations of @xmath64 can occur , a basic fact from the theory of prolongation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.4 ) ) to discover the equation @xmath65 in  [ app : f6 ] , but it will not work for @xmath66 ( the largest degree we tested ) .",
    "however , @xmath67 has an action of the group @xmath68 and we suspected that @xmath11 is defined by invariants of @xmath68 .",
    "this gives a much smaller space of functions to search .",
    "set @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for each even degree",
    "@xmath71 the space of @xmath68-invariants in @xmath72 has a basis consisting of quintuples of young tableaux each of shape @xmath73 ( there are no invariants in odd degree ) .",
    "a quintuple of tableau can be interpreted as a function on @xmath35 by applying the young symmetrizer associated to the quintuple of tableaux .",
    "since @xmath58 is a quotient of @xmath74 , it is spanned by linear combinations of quintuples of young tableaux which now satisfy certain linear dependencies .",
    "an explicit basis of @xmath75 may be found without explicit knowledge of all of the relations as follows .",
    "we can verify that a given set of quintuples of tableaux are linearly independent by evaluating them on dimension - many pseudo - random points of @xmath35 .",
    "if the matrix constructed in this way has full rank , then we have a basis of that space of invariants . if not , we continue selecting random quintuples until a basis is found .",
    "finally , the space @xmath76 has an additional action of @xmath77 . assuming that there is a single minimal generator of @xmath78 in a given @xmath76",
    ", it must be a semi - invariant of @xmath77 , so either an invariant or skew - invariant .",
    "let @xmath79 ( respectively @xmath80 ) denote the subspace of @xmath81 of @xmath82-invariants ( respectively skew - invariants ) .",
    "in figure  [ ud ] we list the dimensions of these spaces of invariants for degrees up to @xmath2 .",
    "the results follow from standard character theory calculations whose explanation we will omit .",
    "[ ud ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we focus our search for equations of @xmath11 in the space of semi - invariants for @xmath83 .",
    "we describe this procedure in the case @xmath66 in  [ app : f16 ] .",
    "the following proposition is a summary of what we found :    [ prop : eqns ] there are minimal equations @xmath84 vanishing on @xmath11 of degrees @xmath1 and @xmath2 . both are invariant under @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath65 is a skew - invariant under @xmath77 while @xmath18 is a @xmath77-invariant .",
    "to clarify : @xmath65 was constructed explicitly and we verified symbolically that it vanishes on @xmath11 and that it is a skew - invariant .",
    "the polynomial @xmath18 was also constructed explicitly and verified to be a @xmath77-invariant , but we only verified that it vanishes on a large collection of pseudo - random points on @xmath11 , and hence it belongs to the ideal of @xmath11 with high probability .      given a monomial in the @xmath49 ( the coordinates on @xmath14 ) , define its skew - symmetrization to be @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the coefficient of @xmath49 in the sum .",
    "the polynomial @xmath65 has @xmath87 monomials and is the sum of the skew - symmetrizations of the following @xmath88 monomials : @xmath89    there is an alternative description in terms of young symmetrizers , following the same construction outlined in @xcite .",
    "the young symmetrizer algorithm takes as input a set of fillings of five young diagrams , performs a series of skew - symmetrizations and symmetrizations , and produces as output a polynomial in the associated schur module .",
    "one can search over all possible shapes and fillings of tableaux for a fixed number of boxes and evaluate young symmetrizers to find modules of equations in @xmath90 .",
    "we describe this method more fully in the next section . in degree",
    "@xmath1 the situation is particularly nice .",
    "it turns out that there are 5 standard tableaux of shape @xmath91 and content @xmath92 and the following schur module , which uses one of each of the 5 standard fillings , realizes the non - trivial copy of @xmath93 inside of @xmath94 : @xmath95 from this description of the invariant , one can use the classical symbolic method to verify that a general point of the fifth secant variety must be a zero of this invariant ( see @xcite for complete descriptions of this type of argument , or also @xcite ) .",
    "this gives an unconditional proof that @xmath17 is in @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , in ",
    "[ sec : complement ] we explain how this description of @xmath17 also provides a generalization to 5th secant varieties of any larger number of segre products of projective spaces of any dimensions .",
    "we follow the approach outlined in ",
    "[ sec : eqn - gen ] .",
    "our search for new equations in degrees @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 did not yield any new equations , so we only describe our process in the degree @xmath2 case .",
    "we used maple , and the code for these computations may be found in the ancillary files accompanying the arxiv version of this paper . using the approach ,",
    "we conclude that there are no @xmath82 skew - invariants in @xmath101 .",
    "we found that @xmath102 and equals @xmath103 with high probability .",
    "note that for @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 if and only if @xmath106 since @xmath65 is a skew - invariant under @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath107 is @xmath0-dimensional , we know that @xmath108 is a @xmath0-dimensional subspace of @xmath109 . since @xmath110 ( with high probability ) , we find that @xmath111 has one additional minimal generator in degree @xmath2 .",
    "let us describe in more detail the case of finding @xmath82-invariants , the skew - invariant case is similar .",
    "let @xmath112 denote quintuples of young tableaux all of shape @xmath113 .",
    "the sum @xmath114 is in @xmath109 .",
    "the young symmetrizer algorithm ( see @xcite ) can be used to evaluate @xmath115 on a point of @xmath35 to test if it is non - zero .",
    "each evaluation took between 500 and 23000 seconds and up to approximately 10 gb of ram on our servers .",
    "we continued this randomized search for non - zero elements of @xmath109 until @xmath116 linearly independent invariants were found ( the list of quintuples of fillings , data points , and code can be found in the ancillary files ) .",
    "to verify independence , we chose @xmath116 pseudo - random points @xmath117 and verified that the matrix @xmath118 has full rank .",
    "while each evaluation @xmath119 is expensive , they are all independent computations .",
    "the distributed computation took approximately 2 - 3 days of computational time to verify the independence of @xmath115 .",
    "we then took @xmath120 pseudo - random points @xmath121 and computed the matrix @xmath122 ( only @xmath116 points are strictly necessary , but we included @xmath1 more to increase the probability that our result is correct ) .",
    "this computation took an additional 2 - 3 days to complete .",
    "finally we found that the matrix @xmath123 has rank @xmath124 , so there is a @xmath103-dimensional space of invariants vanishing on @xmath125 and vanishing on all of @xmath11 with high probability .",
    "an expression of a basis of the kernel of the transpose of @xmath122 gives , in turn , a basis of @xmath126 via linear combinations of quintuples of symmetrized sums of tableaux .",
    "modding out by the space of invariants generated by @xmath17 , ( in principle ) one finds @xmath18 .",
    "[ lem : codim2 ] @xmath11 has codimension @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "[ lem : bertini ] @xmath127 .",
    "computing the degree of an algebraic variety is a basic function of the software bertini @xcite , see the ancillary files and @xcite .",
    "we thank jon hauenstein for his help with this computation .",
    "the idea is to intersect @xmath11 with a randomly chosen @xmath128 and find @xmath129 points .",
    "one of the basic methods of numerical algebraic geometry ( and bertini , in particular ) is numerical homotopy continuation , which relies on high precision numerical path tracking to follow the paths traced out by a homotopy from a system of polynomial equations with known roots to the desired system . for more details on these types of computations applied to tensor decomposition ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the points found are represented by floating point numbers , so only satisfy the equations approximately .",
    "though these methods have been rigorously tested through countless examples , are open source and repeatable , there is still a chance that the computations yield a false positive result , so we only claim that the result holds with high probability , so the proof of the lemma may be read as evidence for the statement .    using the notation from proposition  [ prop : eqns ]",
    ", let @xmath130 , which is a complete intersection .",
    "we have @xmath131 and @xmath132 . since @xmath11 is irreducible of codimension @xmath0 ( lemma  [ lem : codim2 ] ) , and @xmath133 is equidimensional , @xmath133 is also irreducible ( otherwise the degree inequality would be violated ) .",
    "so @xmath11 is the reduced subscheme of @xmath133 .",
    "also , this implies that they have the same degree , so @xmath133 is generically reduced . since @xmath133 is cohen  macaulay",
    ", generically reduced is equivalent to reduced .",
    "hence @xmath134 is a complete intersection .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the equations @xmath17 and @xmath18 provide modules of equations for all other 5th secant varieties of segre products , both when the dimensions of the factors increase ( by `` inheritance '' ) and when the number of factors increase ( by flattening ) .",
    "inheritance for secant varieties was introduced in @xcite , and was reinvestigated many times since .",
    "inheritance can be encoded in the formality of @xmath47-modules @xcite ; we hope that our description here provides an entry point to this formalism for the unfamiliar reader .",
    "the assignment @xmath135 is a multivariate polynomial functor @xmath51 on @xmath12-tuples of vector spaces , as is the assignment of the coordinate ring of the @xmath12th secant variety of the corresponding segre product .",
    "similarly , there is a functor @xmath136 defined by @xmath137 ( the tor groups are @xmath138-graded , and the subscript denotes the @xmath139th homogeneous piece ) .",
    "when @xmath140 , this is the space of minimal generators in degree @xmath139 of the ideal of @xmath141 .    as a representation of @xmath142 , a @xmath143-invariant of degree @xmath144 is the schur functor @xmath145 .",
    "so proposition  [ prop : eqns ] can be interpreted as saying that @xmath146 appears with multiplicity @xmath41 in @xmath147 ( coming from @xmath65 ) and @xmath148 appears with multiplicity @xmath41 in @xmath149 ( coming from @xmath18 ) .",
    "the koszul relation amongst @xmath65 and @xmath18 also shows that @xmath150 appears with multiplicity @xmath41 in @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , if any other product of schur functors @xmath152 appears in any @xmath136 then @xmath153 for some @xmath5 since it vanishes when we evaluate on @xmath154 .    there is another interpretation of our results using @xmath47-modules ( see @xcite ) : the @xmath12th secant variety of the segre product of projective spaces is a @xmath47-variety , and hence the assignment of a tuple of vector spaces to the space of degree @xmath56 equations vanishing on the @xmath12th secant variety is a finitely generated @xmath47-module ( which implies finitely presented using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.1.3 ) ) . for @xmath63",
