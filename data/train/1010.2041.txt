    "abelian continuous lgts are successful as having been proven to be asymptotically free @xcite in the weak coupling limit , and important in the study of quark confinement at the strong coupling limit @xcite .    for abelian lgts",
    "it is possible to simulate numerically the continuum limit , @xmath15 , in an appropriate way , and verify that the resulting theory is the actual qed without confinement .",
    "this verification is important since on the lattice , most lgts show confinement which is an artifact .",
    "it so happens that in the strong coupling limit of an lgt , the property that the gauge group is compact is essential for observing confinement , regardless of whether it is abelian or non  abelian .",
    "related to this , the phase diagram of lgts is very rich and relevant for taking the continuum limit @xcite , and the @xmath0 lgt serves as a test ground for this purpose . unlike the non  abelian @xmath16 lgts , which have a discrete center subgroup @xmath17",

    "note that , whenever one face is merged to another , the new edges have the opposite direction than the original ones , as noted above .",

    "we refer the reader to [ construction ] for technical details of these explicit constructions . here",
    "we emphasize that this construction is achieved by applying the merge and the deletion rule on specific faces of the @xmath4 lattice , and by fixing some variables using the gauge symmetry of the model ( `` gauge fixing '' ) .",
    "the latter is a procedure that can be carried out so long as the edges whose variable has been fixed do not form a closed loop @xcite .",

    "we have proven that any classical partition function depending on continuous variables subject to conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) , ( [ condition2 ] ) and ( [ condition3 ] ) can be approximated ( to an arbitrary precision ) by the partition function of a @xmath4 @xmath0 lgt . in the proof we first introduced a quantum representation of the @xmath0 lgt partition function . then through merging and deletion of gauge field variables and proper choices of local coupling constants , a mapping from a @xmath4 @xmath0 lgt partition function to a more general partition function is established . in this sense",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath0 lgt is a complete model for a large class of classical models .",
    "the completeness result is also generalized to include continuous models with constraints ( if we are allowing complex coupling constants ) and discrete models . as a further development and important application of the completeness result",
    ", we have developed a consistent theory of the @xmath0 lgt coupled to a background metric .",
    "the action is defined in a form ( [ caction ] ) very close to that of the model in flat spacetime .",
    "our completeness result holds for this model such that its partition function can be mapped ( approximated to an arbitrary precision ) to the partition function of a @xmath0 lgt in flat spacetime .",
    "this is the first time that a completeness result is established for continuous statistical models .",
    "we believe that our completeness result can not be proven with a @xmath8 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "another open question is whether a similar result can be found for non  abelian lgts ( e.g. for @xmath362 or @xmath363 lgts ) .",
    "we envisage that these theories may require a new approach since a direct generalization of our construction seems not to be possible .",

    "to generate the functions of the set ( [ basis ] ) we will proceed similarly as in @xcite , namely we will make use of the merge and the deletion rule , and of the gauge fixing of edges .",
    "the latter is a procedure for fixing the values of the variables in the lattice , which results in a theory that is physically equivalent to the original one .",
    "this can be carried out by virtue of the gauge symmetry of the model .",
    "the only restriction in this procedure is that the edges whose variables are fixed by the gauge can not form a closed loop @xcite .    to construct the many  body interactions , we first need to `` propagate '' the variables inside the lattice in order to bring them close together to interact .",
    "this propagation is achieved with the following construction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : concatenation - u1 ] ) . on a cube ( on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : concatenation - u1 ] ) , we merge the face at the front , at the bottom , and at the back to generate the interaction @xmath364 .",
    "then , we let this coupling strength go to infinity , @xmath365 , which imposes the constraint @xmath366 .",
    "the same process is repeated for the cube on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : concatenation - u1 ] , where the constraint reads @xmath367 .",
    "thus , we have set @xmath368 , that is , @xmath369 has `` propagated '' two sites to the right .",
    "note that if @xmath369 were propagated an odd number of times , the resulting variable would equal @xmath370 .",
    "this can be circumvented by letting @xmath369 participate in the final interaction with the opposite sign ( as explained below ) . in order to see how to turn the propagation path",
    ", we refer the reader to the explanations on fig .",
    "11 of @xcite , since the construction is analogous .     across the @xmath4 square lattice ( the figure shows only a @xmath8 projection of this space ) .",
    "in all figures , red edges denote edges whose variable has been fixed by the gauge . by means of the merge rule , @xmath369 is propagated into @xmath371 , since @xmath372 and @xmath373 . ]",
    "now we focus on the replication of the ( classical , continuous ) variables , that is , on the generation of several copies of a given variable .",
    "this is achieved by applying the propagation procedure explained above into the fourth dimension , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4d - replication - u1 ] .",
    "the interaction in the yellow cube is of the form @xmath374 , on which we let @xmath153 and thereby impose @xmath375 ( i.e.  we apply the merge rule on this cube as well ) . the rest works exactly as the propagation explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : concatenation - u1 ] .",
    "we note that the reason for using a fourth dimension in the replication of edge variables is that all schemes we have found in three dimensions involve closed loops of variables fixed by the gauge @xcite .     into @xmath371 , @xmath376 and @xmath377 .",
    "this replication is essentially a propagation ( as the one of fig .",
    "[ fig : concatenation - u1 ] ) in the fourth dimension , i.e.  the variable lives now in another @xmath8 space . ]",
    "next we show how to generate interactions of the type ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "the generation of the interactions @xmath378 for the specific case @xmath379 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - sum ] .",
    "we first propagate each of the variables @xmath380 inside the lattice in order to distribute them on the edges of the rectangular prism shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - sum ] .",
    "then we merge all faces on the exterior surface of this prism into one large , blue face .",
    "as shown above , this face only depends on the spins at its boundaries , that is , it has the form @xmath381 since the dependence on every auxiliary variable @xmath382 cancels , it takes the desired form @xmath383 .",
    "the generalization to any @xmath79 is straightforward . for odd @xmath79",
    ", we construct a longer or shorter prism than that of fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - sum ] , arranging @xmath384 variables in front of the remaining @xmath384 ( as @xmath369 and @xmath385 are arranged in front of @xmath371 and @xmath386 ) .",
    "the remaining variable would be unpaired , and the vertical edge on the corner of the prism fixed by the gauge ( just as @xmath376 ) .",
    "for even @xmath79 the construction is simpler .",
    "for @xmath387 we arrange the spins @xmath388 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - sum ] , and we merge the large , blue face over the face joining the red u  shapes of @xmath385 and @xmath386 on the right . for any other even @xmath79 , we similarly arrange @xmath389 variables in front of the remaining ones .",
    "finally , note that the generation of interactions of the type @xmath390 is achieved by first replicating the variable @xmath369 , and then letting its two copies participate in a two  body interaction as explained above .    .",
    "red edges ( except for the one marked with @xmath391 stand for edges whose variables have been fixed to zero using the gauge symmetry , and blue faces stand for merged faces , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mergedeletionrule ] .",
    "if @xmath392 , as the other spins , the large blue face contains the five  body interaction @xmath393 , whereas if @xmath394 , it depends on @xmath395 . ]    now we only need to show how to generate interactions involving variables with different signs . the generation of @xmath396 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - difference ] .",
    "the variables which have the same relative sign are arranged as explained for the cosine of the sum of variables ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - sum ] ) .",
    "the new element here is that the two sets of variables which have the opposite relative sign must arranged perpendicularly to each other .",
    "then a large , blue face is merged over the external faces , where the desired interaction takes place .",
    "one can also verify that the dependency on the auxiliary variables @xmath382 cancels out , and that variables perpendicular to each other have the opposite sign .",
    "the generalization to an interaction @xmath397 is also straightforward .",
    "one only has to arrange the first set of variables as explained for the case @xmath398 , with @xmath399 either odd or even .",
    "the other set of variables is arranged also as explained above ( with @xmath400 being odd or even ) , and set perpendicular to the first set .    .",
    "the meaning of the symbols is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - sum ] . ]",
    "finally , we point out that the sine functions are generated by making use of the relation @xmath401 .",
    "this phase amounts to gauge fixing one of the spins to @xmath402 instead of 0 , as the rest .",
    "for example , to generate @xmath403 we construct the interaction of fig .",
    "[ fig : mdr - sum ] , and we fix @xmath404 .",
    "this shows how one can generate all interactions of the set ( [ basis ] ) starting from a @xmath4 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "the construction also shows that each fourier basis function ( i.e.  each term in the set ( [ basis ] ) ) requires a polynomial enlargement in the number of variables of the @xmath4 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "we shall return to this fact in @xmath75 , where we specify the overhead in the system size of the complete model as a function of the features of the target model .",
    "in the completeness result of @xmath75 , we have made a truncation in the fourier series basis ( see ( [ lgt ] ) and ( [ range ] ) ) so as to approximate a general hamiltonian as an expansion .",
    "here comes a question of accuracy .",
    "that is , given a truncation @xmath405 in the fourier modes , how close is the following finite fourier series @xmath406\\equiv\\sum_{\\{m_{j}\\}}h^{(k)}_{\\{m_{j}\\}}\\exp{\\left\\{\\mathrm{i}\\sum_{j}m_{j}\\theta_{j}\\right\\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to the original hamiltonian function @xmath407 of a @xmath79-body interaction term ?",
    "according to @xcite , for a smooth enough ( usually at least differentiable ) single variable function @xmath408 $ ] with @xmath409 , we have @xmath410-f(\\theta)|\\leq a(f)\\sum_{p(\\alpha)}\\frac{1}{m^{p(\\alpha)}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath411 $ ] is a finite fourier series of @xmath412 with @xmath413 terms ( truncated at the @xmath181 mode as in our case ) , @xmath414 is a finite factor depending on the function form of @xmath412 on the domain only , and the finite sum is over some polynomials @xmath415 of @xmath416 .",
    "therefore we see that in order to have an accuracy @xmath417 for the finite fourier series of a single variable , we need a polynomially large truncation @xmath418 in the fourier modes",
    ". we could say that we have a polynomial accuracy in this case . now with a @xmath79-body interaction term which is a function of @xmath79 variables , in order to have an accuracy @xmath419-h^{(k)}({\\{\\theta_{j}\\}})|\\leq\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{n}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we shall need @xmath420^{k}$ ] terms in the finite fourier series .",
    "_ i.e. _ the @xmath421 power of some polynomial of @xmath175 .",
    "therefore it is still efficient if the model has only few  body interactions ( _ e.g. _ nearest neighbor interactions only ) or if @xmath79 scales polynomially with the system size .",
