    "<S> the slowest dynamics is generated by the mixing with almost degenerate energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between these neighbored levels is according to perturbation theory @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the particle leaks into such an eigenstate on the timescale @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> . eigenstates with @xmath75 are hardly perturbed by the central site . however , in rare cases with probability @xmath76 , adjacent eigenstates are close to each other and strongly mixed by the central site . </S>",
    "<S> then , the particle is equally likely to be found in both eigenstates at large times , contributing to a probability that the particle left its initial eigenstate given by @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above intuition can be quantified by a three - site model . within this toy - model </S>",
    "<S> , we study the motion of a particle starting on a site of potential @xmath50 through the central site into the continuum . when the coupling to the central site is weak , @xmath48 , we are in the perturbative regime where mixing occurs with a small number of sites within @xmath55 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence in our case it suffices to consider the coupling to a single site of energy @xmath78 and average over all @xmath79 $ ] after the equations of motions are solved . </S>",
    "<S> this average neglects correlations between initially unoccupied ring sites , which is a reasonable assumption for @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it accounts for a small level splitting which , in contrast to the conventional fano resonance  @xcite , is present in our problem due to the poisson distribution of level spacings in the unperturbed model . using the three - site model @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath80 that the particle left its initial site becomes @xmath81 which depends on the potential at the initial position . at a given time @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> , sites with energy @xmath83 have saturated their dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> summing the contributions from all such sites , we get that the number of particles that are located at other sites is @xmath84 where ellipses denote possible constant terms . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic dependence here emerges from the summation over all possible energies of initial site , which translates into the integral of @xmath85 over @xmath50 with limits set by time . in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entgrowth ] we compare the result of the three - site model , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : n3s ] ) , with the numerical data of the full model and find good agreement in the regime of logarithmic growth of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> as we outline in @xcite , the entanglement entropy @xmath64 can be expressed by means of @xmath80 , which explains the logarithmic time - dependence of the entanglement entropy , plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entgrowth ] .    finally , at @xmath86 , the energy scale @xmath53 becomes of the order of the bandwidth @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , level repulsion is present for all energy states of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> then , we expect much faster spreading of the particles , caused by the strong level admixture : the saturation time in such regime becomes simply an inverse level spacing @xmath87 . inserting this into the first line of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : numerical_evidence ] ) , we get @xmath88 . averaging this over the initial energy @xmath50 results in the linear spreading of @xmath89 , and </S>",
    "<S> ballistic entanglement dynamics , as confirmed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : entgrowth ] .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary _ we have considered the behavior of an anderson localized fermionic chain perturbed by coupling all sites to the additional central site . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates after perturbation loose their local character , but still keep the localized statistics . </S>",
    "<S> statistics of level spacings and dynamical probes reveal the crossover between two different regimes . in the weak coupling regime , </S>",
    "<S> most of the eigenvalues of the system are poisson - distributed , which leads to a break down of the fano resonance picture . </S>",
    "<S> this regime shows logarithmic in time growth of entanglement entropy caused by the spreading of particles . </S>",
    "<S> the second regime , where level repulsion is present , can be mapped to the fano resonance problem , and it is characterized by ballistic motion of entanglement .    </S>",
    "<S> overall our findings support the intuition that a single degree of freedom , even if it is coupled non - locally to the anderson insulator is not sufficient to delocalize the system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results suggest that logarithmic entanglement growth can be realized in non - interacting models of free fermions , and is related to the persistence of the poisson level statistics in parts of the spectrum .    _ </S>",
