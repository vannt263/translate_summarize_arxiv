    "measuring the distribution of mass around galaxies at large radii ( @xmath9 ) provides a critical test for cosmological models . by studying the mass distribution at these distances ,",
    "we directly address one of the most intriguing questions of modern cosmology  the nature of dark matter .",
    "specifically , we wish to determine the extent of galaxy dark matter halos and their density profile .",
    "while the inner parts of galaxy halos have density distributions that yield approximately flat rotation curves , our understanding of the profile at larger distances is much poorer .",
    "the issue is critical because the density profile that gives rise to a flat rotation curve ( @xmath10 ) is different from that predicted by cosmological models ( nfw * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at larger distances ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the challenge in measuring the mass distribution at large radii arises from the difficulty in finding a visible tracer to probe the mass .",
    "historically , neutral hydrogen ( hi ) has been used to study the outer parts of rotation curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since hi is detected well beyond the optical boundaries of spiral galaxies .",
    "the observations demonstrating that hi rotation velocities of field spirals are roughly constant at large galactocentric distances provides one of the primary pieces of evidence that galaxies are embedded in massive dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , hi emission is detected only out to 3050 kpc .",
    "x - ray emission from the diffuse hot gas in isolated elliptical galaxies also indicates the presence of massive dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but , just like hi in spiral galaxies , the x - ray emission does not extend far enough to distinguish isothermal from cosmological @xmath12 profiles @xcite .",
    "strong gravitational lensing places an important upper limit on the amount of dark matter but only in the inner ( few tens of ) regions of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "weak gravitational lensing provides a more promising method of studying the outer parts of galaxies .",
    "individual field galaxies produce a small distortion of background galaxies , and this distortion can be used to measure the galaxy  mass correlation function .",
    "unfortunately , the existing data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not distinguish between a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ; * ? ? ? * ) and a cosmological nfw profile : both models provide good fits to the galaxy  mass correlation function in the outer regions where the error bars are large .",
    "moreover , the galaxy  mass correlation function can be affected by neighbors of the lens galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once the contamination from the neighboring galaxies is taken into account , as done by , for example , @xcite , @xcite place only a lower limit on the size of the halo .",
    "velocities of satellites of galaxies provide another way to probe the mass distribution at large radii .",
    "these have been used to constrain the mass of the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite . however , because the number of detectable satellites around galaxies outside of the local group is small , one needs to study many galaxies to accumulate enough statistics to study the profiles of other galaxies . as a result ,",
    "observational efforts to study the dynamics of satellites have been somewhat limited @xcite .",
    "important early results were obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who compiled and studied a sample of about 100 satellites of nearby isolated spiral galaxies with an average of 12 satellites per primary galaxy .",
    "it was found that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the satellites does not decline with the projected distance to the primary galaxy .",
    "this result has been generally considered a strong argument for the presence of dark matter at large distances ( @xmath13200400 kpc ) around galaxies .",
    "@xcite also found that the satellite velocity dispersion does not correlate with the luminosity of the primary galaxy .",
    "@xcite used the sdss to select and study a much larger sample of 1225 satellites .",
    "the mean number of satellites they found around each host was only two .",
    "the new analysis confirmed that the velocity dispersion of satellites does not decline with distance from the primary , as observed by @xcite .",
    "this implies that halos of isolated galaxies extend to distances of several hundred . in contradiction with the earlier results , however ,",
    "@xcite find that the velocity dispersion of satellites , @xmath14 , increases with the luminosity , @xmath15 , of the primary galaxy as @xmath16 and claim that this is consistent with the predictions of the semi - analytical models of galaxy formation of @xcite when the sample of primary galaxies in the models is defined as it is in the observational analysis .",
    "cosmological models made definite predictions for the mass profile of dark matter halos at large distances .",
    "although sis halo models with density @xmath17 and @xmath18 are often _ assumed _ , there is little justification for using sis at these distances .",
    "the main _ motivations _ for using sis are simplicity and extrapolation of flat rotation curves to much larger radii .",
    "however , during the last two decades of intensive numerical modeling of galaxy formation , not a single model has produced an sis .",
    "every cosmological model studied so far ( and there have been plenty ) has @xmath11 at large radii .",
    "the slope does not depend on the mean density of matter : cdm with @xmath19 @xcite and  with @xmath20 @xcite have the same slope .",
    "it does not depend on the nature of the dark matter : warm dark matter @xcite , self - interacting dark matter @xcite , and cold dark matter all make the same prediction .",
    "the slope does not depend on the halo mass : halos ranging from cluster masses to dwarf masses all have @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , the declining velocity dispersion of satellites is not a test for the parameters of cosmological models , but rather of the hierarchical scenario itself .",
    "it is ironic that the same argument  the constant velocity dispersion of satellites  which just a few years ago provided one of the strongest cases for the existence of dark matter , is now an argument _ against dark matter_. the only model that predicts a constant velocity dispersion is modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) .    as previous authors have noted @xcite , a comprehensive measurement of the satellite velocity dispersion profile around isolated galaxies",
    "should ideally combine two main elements : ( 1 ) a large number of primary galaxy and satellite ( candidates ) to estimate the satellite kinematics in separate bins of primary mass ( or luminosity ) and projected separation , and ( 2 ) a model - independent , robust , and testable rejection of interloper galaxies  dwarfs with large physical distances from the primary galaxies but small projected and velocity differences  that are not bound to the primary .",
    "the effect of the interlopers is to make the halo mass profile difficult to measure , and that may have led to systematic effects in the few observations that suggest a constant velocity dispersion at large radii .",
    "understanding their effect is crucial for any interpretation of the halo mass distribution .",
    "results from weak lensing can be affected by the presence of nearby projected neighbors , leading to similar systematic problems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we use the vast data base of sdss to study the motion of satellites around a carefully selected sample of isolated nearby galaxies .",
    "we also develop an improved , model - independent approach for interloper rejection , which , together with state - of - the art cosmological @xmath22-body simulations of galaxies and their satellites , allows us to measure the dark matter halo profile .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the observational data and the criteria for selecting our samples of primaries and satellites .",
    "the numerical simulations are briefly described in section 3 , where we also discuss the use of simulations to test prescriptions to remove interlopers .",
    "our observational results are presented in section 4 , and our conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the sdss @xcite is a survey that images up to @xmath23 @xmath24 of the the northern galactic cap in five bands @xmath25 @xcite using a drift - scanning mosaic ccd camera @xcite , down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "approximately 900,000 galaxies down to @xmath27 will be targeted for spectroscopic follow - up using two fiber - fed spectrographs on the same telescope @xcite .    for the current analysis , we use data on galaxies for which spectra were obtained before august 2002 .",
    "we use `` survey quality '' redshifts derived from these spectra by d. schlegel .",
    "the recessional velocity errors are always less than 20  .",
    "our sdss redshift sample consists of 254,073 galaxies distributed in several strips on the sky ; the total area covered by our data is about 2,500  deg@xmath28 .",
    "photometric parameters were taken from the photo measurement @xcite of the brightest object within 3 arcsec that was loaded into the sdss collaboration database in august 2002 ( but see also discussion below ) ; magnitudes were corrected for foreground extinction using the @xcite values loaded in the sdss database .",
    "the sky coverage of the resulting sdss imaging and spectroscopic data is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we supplemented the sdss data with data from the rc3 catalog @xcite for two reasons .",
    "first , as we are identifying isolated galaxies ( see below ) , we want to avoid choosing galaxies that have bright neighbors outside the area covered by the sdss at the time we made our sample ; the rc3 provides a catalog of galaxies over the whole sky to make this possible . while it is true that the rc3 catalog is not complete , especially at larger distances , missing companions in the sdss data are much more likely for the nearest galaxies for which the area on the sky corresponding to our isolation criterion is large . for these",
    ", the rc3 catalog should be nearly complete .",
    "another , possibly more important , reason for using the rc3 is that the version of photo that we were using did not provide accurate photometry for large and bright galaxies owing to problems with the deblending algorithm . as a result",
    ", we used rc3 @xmath29 magnitudes ( or photographical magnitudes if @xmath29 was not available ) , corrected for foreground reddening , for all of the sdss galaxies for which we found a match in the rc3 catalog ( within 0.5 arcmin on the sky and 100 km s@xmath30 in velocity ) ; for all of the other galaxies ( which are the smaller galaxies for which the sdss photometry is accurate ) , we transformed the sdss @xmath31 magnitude to @xmath32 magnitudes using the relation given by @xcite .",
    "our main galaxy list was selected from the full redshift sample by taking all galaxies with @xmath33 and apparent magnitude @xmath34 ; the total number of selected galaxies is 206,352 .",
    "distances are derived assuming a smooth hubble flow with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 100 @xmath37 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 ) ; the heliocentric velocities were converted to the local group standard of rest before computing distances .    for the study of satellite dynamics , we define primary galaxies to be those with absolute blue magnitude brighter than @xmath38 .",
    "we put no restriction on hubble type .",
    "we use three different isolation and selection criteria to define three different samples of _ isolated _ primaries . to be considered",
    "as isolated , a galaxy must have no other galaxies within a magnitude difference @xmath39 , projected separation @xmath40 , and velocity separation @xmath41 .",
    "satellites are defined as all objects within a projected distance @xmath42 and velocity difference @xmath43 and being at least @xmath44 magnitudes fainter than the primary .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] gives the parameters used to define each sample , and the number and median distance of primaries , and the number of satellites .",
    "the first two samples have identical isolation criteria , but sample 2 is defined for primaries out to a larger distance , hence only bright satellites can be seen for the more distant galaxies .",
    "the shallower sample has more satellites per primary , but the more distant sample has an overall larger number of total satellites .",
    "the third sample mimics conditions used by @xcite , in which the isolation criterion is significantly relaxed .",
    "it has a very large search radius ( almost 3  mpc ) , but the luminosity of the neighbors can be quite large : half that of the luminosity of the primary .",
    "in other words , this prescription can pick a bright member of a group of galaxies and erroneously treat it as an `` isolated '' galaxy .",
    "as discussed below we obtain similar results for all of the samples , suggesting that our results are statistically significant and do not depend on the exact isolation criterion .",

    "we have to do this because the @xmath22-body simulation resolves only the region very close to the central halo ; no interlopers are present in the simulation . to make a sample that realistically mimics the observational data we start by making an estimate of the number of expected interlopers in the observed sample . using the sdss field luminosity function",
    "@xcite we find that 0.43 galaxies between @xmath65 are expected inside a volume @xmath66 and with a velocity dispersion of @xmath67 at a distance of @xmath135000  .",
    "this is the estimated number of interlopers per primary , if galaxies are randomly distributed in space .",
    "neglecting the large - scale correlations of galaxies appears to be a reasonable assumption at this point , because our primaries are selected to avoid clusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "the latter are responsible for most galaxy clustering on a scale of a few megaparsecs .",
    "thus , the clustering of galaxies ( with the exception of true satellites ) around our primaries is small and can be neglected . using simulations this point",
    "should be quantified in more detail in the future .    in the observed samples we find on average two satellites per primary .",
    "thus , we expect 0.215 interlopers for each true satellite . in our numerical simulation",

    "velocities for the true satellites and for the combined sample of the satellites and interlopers .",

    "velocity of the true satellites actually decreases with distance .    to reliably estimate the satellite velocity dispersion",
    ", one needs to find a way to account for the interlopers .",
    "we start by characterizing the velocity distribution of true satellites .",
    "motivated by figure [ fig : fig3 ] , we consider a gaussian velocity distribution , but allow the width of the distribution to change with radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows the resulting distribution of normalized ( to the r.m.s .",
    "velocity in different radial bins ) velocities , and demonstrates that the distribution is very close to gaussian . in reality , the distribution can not be completely gaussian because satellites with very high velocities will not be bound to the halo , and will escape . using simple arguments based on the virial theorem",
    ", one naively expects that satellites with velocities twice the r.m.s .",
    "velocity should not be bound .",
    "indeed , we find an indication of this : in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] the points are systematically below the gaussian fit for @xmath70 .",
    "however , it is difficult to use the simple argument because we measure only one component of the velocity and because the escape velocity changes with distance . in any case",
    ", the gaussian fit provides a reasonably accurate approximation for the distribution of the line - of - sight velocities of true satellites .",
    "a simple prescription far removing the interlopers was used by @xcite .",
    "the velocity difference distribution of the entire sample of neighbors ( including objects at all projected distances ) was fitted by a gaussian  +  constant function .",
    "the idea is that the gaussian describes the velocity distribution of satellites , and that the constant takes into account the distribution of interlopers ; the width of the gaussian component gives a direct measurement of the r.m.s .",
    "velocity of the satellites .",
    "our simulations show that the velocities of the true satellites are indeed well approximated by the gaussian distribution , but that the width of the distribution ( i.e. , the velocity dispersion ) is a function of radius .",
    "we find that the @xcite prescription has two problems that result from making a single fit over all radii :    * ( 1 ) * the level of interloper contamination ( the constant in the fit ) does not depend on the distance to the primary .",
    "this is inaccurate because of a purely geometrical factor : the volume and thus , the number of interlopers , is larger for larger radii .",
    "neglecting this dependence produces a bias : the r.m.s .",
    "velocity is overestimated at large radii and underestimated at small radii .    * ( 2 ) * there is no allowance for dependence of the velocity dispersion on projected distance . because this dependence is in fact what we wish to study , we do not want to impose the assumption of a constant velocity dispersion on the prescription for the removal of interlopers .    in fact , if we apply the @xcite prescription to the simulations , we find that the recovered profile of the ( interloper - removed ) r.m.s .",
    "velocity is flat ; the prescription fails to recover the true dispersion profile of the satellites . in this article",

    "figures [ fig : fig7 ] and [ fig : fig8 ] give the predicted nfw velocities for halos of mass @xmath92 ( for primaries with @xmath46 ) and @xmath93 ( for primaries with @xmath45 ) .    if we remove interlopers using the method of @xcite , the mean velocity dispersion for each magnitude bin is smaller than the raw value , but we do not get a declining velocity curve . this explains the difference between our conclusions and those of @xcite , who do not find a radial dependence on velocity dispersion ; as discussed above , we feel that our procedure of allowing for the radial dependence of interloper contamination is better motivated physically .",
    "a comparison of figures  [ fig : fig7 ] and [ fig : fig8 ] clearly indicates that the r.m.s .",
    "velocity increases with the luminosity of the primary .",
    "this contradicts the earlier results of @xcite .",
    "because the nfw profile provides an accurate fit to the observed velocity dispersion profile , we can use it to estimate the virial mass of each group of galaxies . for galaxies with @xmath45",
    "we find @xmath93 .",
    "for the brighter magnitudes , @xmath46 , the virial mass is @xmath94 .",
    "these values give us virial mass - to - light ratios @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the dimmer and brighter galaxies correspondingly .",
    "thus , the @xmath97 ratio increases with the luminosity roughly as @xmath98 .",
    "we believe that this change in @xmath97 with luminosity is real and does not reflect a change in the stellar populations for both magnitude bins .",
    "a reason for this is that we did not see a dependence of the fraction of e ",
    "s0 with luminosity for the primaries in sample 1 , at least from @xmath4819 to @xmath4822 blue absolute magnitudes .",
    "a similar increase of @xmath97 with luminosity ( @xmath99 ) has been seen from weak lensing studies by @xcite .",
    "see , however , @xcite who , also from weak lensing , found no dependence of the @xmath97 on luminosity .    instead of trying to estimate masses of the galaxies ( which is bound to be model - dependent ) , we can study the more direct dependence of the r.m.s .",
    "velocity on the luminosity of the primary galaxy .",
    "this can be viewed as an analog of the tully  fisher relation .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig9 ] presents the dependence of the satellite r.m.s .",
    "velocity , computed within 120  kpc as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "we calculate the r.m.s .",
    "velocity relatively close to the primary galaxy because within this distance the velocity dispersion depends only weakly on the distance to the primary for all primaries considered here .",
    "hence , we can meaningfully compare results from galaxies that might have different sizes .",
    "the estimated value of the velocity dispersion for an @xmath3 galaxy from weak lensing studies @xcite is also shown ; the results of lensing studies are very close to those derived from the sdss satellite data .",
    "the results are consistent with a slope of @xmath100 .",
    "we can write this dependence using a form analogous to the tully  fisher relation : @xmath101 this relation is shown in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "the slope of this relation is the same as for spiral galaxies @xcite , which is shown as a long - dashed line in the figure .",
    "the zero point for the spiral relation was shifted down by factor of 1.6 to match the sdss data points ; this factor is close to the naively expected @xmath102 correction from rotational velocity to 1d line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the remaining difference of 8% is difficult to assign to any particular effect ; there are several effects that could produce the small difference ( e.g. , projection effects , and non - isotropic orbits ) .    however , when we compute the r.m.s .",
    "velocity within a larger radius of 350  , we find @xmath16 .",
    "the reason for the steeper slope is a combination of the very large radius and declining @xmath103 , which will occur if the density profiles of halos at different mass are not homologous , e.g. , if the concentration of the halo decreases with increasing mass .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical prediction .",
    "it is rather straightforward to find the @xmath14virial mass relation for the nfw halos . using the model described in section  [ ref : secremove ] ( equilibrium nfw with slightly anisotropic velocities )",
    ", we find the line - of - sight r.m.s .",
    "velocity averaged for radii 20100  kpc and the line - of - sight velocity for projected distance 350  kpc .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "for the range of masses considered here , the @xmath14@xmath104 relations are power laws . just as the observed slope of the @xmath14@xmath15 relation , the slope of the @xmath14@xmath105 relation increases with the radius within which the r.m.s .",
    "velocity is calculated .",
    "for the 350   radius the slope 0.5 is the same as the slope of the @xmath14@xmath15 relation for the same radius .",
    "this would imply a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this result , being formally correct , is a bit misleading . measured in terms of a more physically motivated quantity , the virial radius , the @xmath97 ratio increases with luminosity .",
    "comparison with theoretical predictions of the luminosities is more complicated and will be deferred to another paper .",
    "we use only the virial @xmath97 for two magnitudes @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in a recent paper , @xcite",
    "ask which model parameters are required for the cosmological models to explain the observed luminosity function and the tully  fisher relation .",
    "the main uncertainty is the @xmath97 ratio .",
    "@xcite predict an @xmath108 that is needed to account for observations .",
    "we compare our two @xmath97 ratios with the @xcite predictions and find them remarkably close .",
    "however , this comparison actually required numerous corrections , including a correction for overdensity of 180 to the virial overdensity , correction for galactic absorption , correction for different bands , and scaling with the hubble constant .",
    "the corrections were provided by rachel somerville .",
    "preliminary comparison with semi - analytical models ( somerville , private communication ) indicate a problem : observed galaxies are @xmath40.75 mag too bright as compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "we construct samples of isolated galaxies and associated satellites using data from the sdss .",
    "we detect about 3000 satellites with absolute blue magnitudes going down to @xmath0 .",
    "analysis of the satellite velocities clearly indicates that galaxies are embedded in large halos extending to distances up to @xmath109 .",
    "our measured velocity dispersion for @xmath110 galaxies is in agreement with measurements from weak lensing studies .",
    "our analysis of galaxies selected from the sdss database clearly indicates that the line - of - sight r.m.s .",
    "velocity of satellites declines with the distance to the primary galaxy .",
    "similar results were found for each of our three samples , suggesting that it is robust to statistical effects and the exact definition of an isolated galaxy .",
    "this decline agrees remarkably well with @xmath21 predicted by all cosmological models .",
    "both the isothermal and mond profiles contradict the observational results .",
    "observations of weak lensing from the sdss combined with the tully  fisher and fundamental plane relations @xcite also finds that the galactic halo profiles has to be steeper than isothermal at large radii .",
    "interlopers play an important role .",
    "we believe that the decline in satellite velocity was not seen previously @xcite , mainly because of either lack of statistics or insufficient removal of interlopers .",
    "we use numerical simulations to test prescriptions for correcting the effects of interlopers and isolation criteria . both effects  interlopers and isolation criteria  have a tendency to overestimate of the mass of the dark matter halo and imply a velocity profile that is too flat .",
    "we find that the satellite velocity dispersion inside a projected 100  kpc radius and the absolute blue magnitude of the galaxy are related as @xmath111 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this dependence is in agreement with the slope and the zero point of the tully  fisher relation for spiral disks . if we calculate the r.m.s .",
    "velocity within a radius of @xmath109 , the slope of the velocity  luminosity relation is visibly steeper : @xmath112 .",
    "the likely explanation for the difference in the slopes is an interplay between the shape of the velocity dispersion and the virial radius of galaxies .",
