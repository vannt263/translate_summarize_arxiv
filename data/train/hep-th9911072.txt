( a simple generalization would be to identify @xmath59 and @xmath60 with integer multiples of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . )",

    "the clebsch representation ( [ eq:2.14b ] ) , ( [ eq:2.15b ] ) and ( [ eq:2.16b ] ) gives a clear picture of the helicity . from ( [ eq:2.16b ] )",
    "we have    [ eq : new24 ] h = - d^3 r _",

    "transversality may be achieved in one of two ways .",

    ", we may choose the function @xmath57 so that @xmath3 is transverse .",
    "we discuss these two possibilities in turn .",
    "the transversality condition affects only the poloidal components of @xmath3 ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , because the toroidal component @xmath83 is @xmath62-independent . by using a gauge function proportional to @xmath84 times a function of @xmath58",

    "indeed this happens for general @xmath57 : one finds h(a^t ) = h(a ) + ( 1-f ) f|_r= [ eq:2.26 ] and the helicity of the gauge - equivalent , transverse configuration differs from the original expression .",
    "however if , and only if , @xmath57 goes at infinite @xmath58 to an even or odd multiple of @xmath69 , the gauge variance vanishes .",
    "thus both integer and half - integer windings are stable against this gauge transformation , which renders the potential transverse , but for other , irrational windings , the `` winding number '' loses its meaning because it is gauge dependent@xcite .    the other way to achieve transversality is to impose that condition on the original configuration ( [ eq:2.23 ] ) , thereby determining @xmath57 .",
    "transversality requires that @xmath57 satisfy r^2 f ",
    "+ 2rf - 2f=0 [ eq:2.27 ] although this equation can not be solved by elementary functions , it is easily analyzed by analogy to a mechanical problem where `` time '' is @xmath86 .",
    "one finds two solutions that are regular at the origin , vanishing linearly with @xmath58 , and tending to @xmath87 in an oscillatory manner for large  @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , the scale of @xmath58 is arbitrary : the solutions are a universal function of @xmath88 and its negative ; the positive solution is plotted in fig .",
