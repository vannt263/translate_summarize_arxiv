    "in recent years more and more experiments show locally ordered regions ( lor ) . localized bose - einstein condensation above the global superfluid transition temperature",
    "is revealed in superfluid transition of @xmath0 in silica gel@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that for some granular superconductors , on the insulating side of the superconductor insulator transition , each grain is separately and independently superconducting while a transport measurement shows the film to be insulating @xcite . in recent experiment on amorphous nbn films , pseudo - gapped state due to the locally superconducting islands is discovered @xcite .",
    "the nucleation of pairing gaps in nanoscale regions above @xmath1 is also found in the high-@xmath1 supercondcutor @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a local metallic state is observed in globally insulating @xmath3 well above the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "the existence of ferromagnetic region in the paraphase of @xmath4 is discovered @xcite .    to understand the relation between lor and the phase transition in a general way ,",
    "the saddle point equation of landau - ginzburg hamiltonian with random temperature is solved recently @xcite .",
    "lor is explicitly shown in these solutions .",
    "moreover it is found that there exist many excited solutions , which minimize the hamiltonian locally in the configuration space .",
    "these solutions can be described by the block model ( in the following we call it b model ) , in which the system is self - organized into blocks .",
    "these blocks behave like superspins and are coupled with their neighbors . in reference @xcite , a general method to calculate the couplings between adjoined blocks is proposed .",
    "this method is based on the free energy increasing of domain wall ( dw ) between the adjoined blocks .",
    "so we call this method dw method .",
    "however for the systems with continuous order parameter , such as superfluid , superconductor , the continuous phase fluctuation about the saddle point solution should be taken into account . in dw method",
    "this kind of fluctuation is absent . in this paper",
    "we study the xy - type landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) hamiltonian with random temperature .",
    "we propose a gaussian approximation to study the continuous phase fluctuation near the saddle point solutions .",
    "we will show that    ( 1 ) .",
    "the system is still be organized into blocks given by the dw method .",
    "( 2 ) . for the modes with lower eigenvalues , the couplings between the blocks are xy - type like a josephson junction array and the couplings are approximately equal to those given by the dw method .",
    "the blocks are coupled like xy - type spins .",
    "our paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , the model of xy - type landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) hamiltonian with random temperature is given . in section iii , one dimensional case is discussed . in section iv ,",
    "two dimensional case is discussed .",
    "section v is a summary .",
    "we consider the xy - type landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) hamiltonian with random temperature @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the average reduced temperature and the random part caused by the disorder respectively .",
    "the parameters are scaled according to the references @xcite .",
    "the saddle point equations are given by @xmath9\\phi_x({\\textbf r})=0 , \\label{eq : spe1}\\ ] ] @xmath10\\phi_y({\\textbf r})=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : spe1}\\ ] ]    through this paper we assume the saddle point solutions are along @xmath11 direction , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is used to label the excited states .    substituting the saddle point solution into eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) , one get the free energy @xcite",
    "@xmath14 for the @xmath13th solution .",
    "if we assume the solution is along @xmath11 direction and ignore the fluctuation in @xmath15 direction , the problem is reduced to be ising - type .",
    "it has been shown that in that case the system is self - organized into blocks and the blocks are coupled like ising - spins @xcite .",
    "the couplings between blocks can be obtained by calculating the free energy increase due to the domain wall @xcite .",
    "if @xmath16 is regarded as a complex parameter , letting @xmath17 is a constraint that only the phase of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is allowed .",
    "if we take the fluctuation of @xmath15 is into account , the phase fluctuation becomes continuous .    in order to write the hamiltonian in terms of the amplitude and phase of the order parameter",
    ", we introduce @xmath20 then lgw hamiltonian becomes @xmath21     + { 1 \\over 2}t({\\textbf r})\\phi^2     + { 1 \\over 4}\\phi^4\\}. \\label{eq : h1}\\ ] ] in this form , we can see that the free energy increase induced by the variation of phase is proportioned to the square of amplitude .",
    "as an example , we first consider a system with size being @xmath22 consisting of 7 wells and 7 barriers , i.e. the temperature field is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "here we let the spatial coordinate be @xmath25 to distinguish from the directions of order parameter .",
    "obviously this system is periodic with period of @xmath26 .",
    "the ground state solution @xmath27 for the temperature field with @xmath28 is shown in the fig .",
    "the saddle point equation is solved by finite - difference method with step @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the saddle point solution is approximately equal to @xmath30 at the centers of wells and decays to very small in the barriers @xcite . using the dw method",
    ", we can show that there are @xmath31 elementary blocks and can calculate the couplings between the adjoined blocks .",
    "for example , letting the initial value of @xmath11 be negative in the first well and positive at other positions , we will get the excited solutions @xmath32 , which is also shown in the fig .",
    "the spatial range of the first block is given by @xmath33 .",
    "explicitly it is @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , letting the initial value of @xmath11 be negative in the second well and positive at other positions , we will get the excited solutions @xmath35 .",
    "the spatial range of the second block is @xmath36 .",
    "we do not show it in figure since its shape is the same as @xmath32 and can be obtained by shifting @xmath32 in @xmath25-axis by @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the spatial ranges of the 7 elementary blocks are given by @xmath37 , where satisfy @xmath38 , for @xmath39 .",
    "here we give a general method to get the spatial range of the elementary block .",
    "for the general disordered cases , the domain wall of elementary block can obtained by the method of opening windows @xcite .",
    "the spatial range of this block is that surrounded by the domain wall .",
    "letting the initial value of @xmath11 be negative in both the first and second well and positive at other positions , we will get the excited solutions @xmath40 . substituting the solutions @xmath41 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fe ] ) , we get the free energies @xmath42 , and the free energy increases @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". then the couplings between blocks is given by @xcite @xmath46 here we use  ( d ) \" to denote the dw method . in this way",
    "we get the couplings between adjoined blocks .",
    "then the free energy of @xmath13th state is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the sign of the ith block in the @xmath13th solution .",
    "the couplings between adjoined blocks with @xmath49 at different @xmath50 are given in table 1 .",
    "considering the symmetry of the system , the effective hamiltonian should be xy type rather than ising type .",
    "simply let @xmath51 be unit two dimensional vectors , i.e. @xmath52 eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising ] ) becomes a xy model .",
    "dw method does not contradict to this conclusion and it only provided us the excited states with @xmath53 .    to study the cases with continuous @xmath54 , we expand the glw hamiltonian near the ground state saddle point solution .",
    "let @xmath55 and we consider the gauss approximation that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the free energy of ground state solution and @xmath58\\tilde{\\phi}_x^2]d\\xi\\ ] ] @xmath59\\tilde{\\phi}_y^2 ] d\\xi , \\ ] ] where the quartic terms are omitted .    because the saddle point solution is assumed along @xmath11 direction , the fluctuation of @xmath11 is the amplitude fluctuation and that of @xmath15 is just the phase fluctuation .",
    "the eigenmodes of @xmath60 satisfies the following equation @xmath61\\varphi_n=\\lambda_n \\varphi_n \\label{eq : eigen}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is eigenvalues and @xmath63 are the eigenfunctions .",
    "then we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 the contribution of phase fluctuation to the partition function is given by @xmath66    we discretize the equation ( [ eq : eigen ] ) with grid of step @xmath67 and solve it by lapack , which is a package to deal matrix .",
    "the first 15 eigenvalues are shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and some eigenfunctions are shown in fig .",
    "the modes of @xmath60 with lower eigenvalues give the main contribution beyond the saddle point solution . as shown in fig .",
    "( 1b ) , where @xmath68 , the first 7 eigenvalues are remarkably lower than other eigenvalues .",
    "then they possess much bigger thermodynamic amplitudes than other modes according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : party ] ) .    in order to understand the first 7 eigenfunctions more clearly",
    ", we introduce @xmath69 and show @xmath70 in fig .",
    "this function show the phase variation of the eigenfunctions .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "( 1d ) , @xmath71 is a constant .",
    "this is because that the first eigenfunction @xmath72 has eigenvalue @xmath73 and satisfies @xmath74 this can be shown by comparing the equation ( 3 ) and ( [ eq : eigen ] ) .",
    "this eigenfunction corresponds to a global rotation , so its eigenvalue is zero .",
    "@xmath73 corresponds to the infrared divergence .    observing @xmath75",
    ", one can see that the variation of phase in the wells are obviously smaller than in barriers .",
    "@xmath76 also have the this feature . from eq.([eq",
    ": h1 ] ) , we can see that the free energy increase related to the phase fluctuation is proportional to the square of ground state saddle point solution .",
    "in the barriers , the saddle point solution is much smaller than in the wells",
    ". therefore phase fluctuation in the barriers induced small energy increase .",
    "the eighth eigenfuction does not have such a feature and its energy is remarkably higher than the first 7 modes .",
    "this means that for the first 7 modes , each block can be regarded as a unit .",
    "the phase variation inside the block can be ignored and only the phase difference between blocks are concerned .",
    "therefore we introduce the block functions @xmath77 where the spatial range given by @xmath38 is explicitly given by @xmath78 as mentioned in subsection iii a.    then we assume that @xmath79 where only one phase is assigned to each block , then eq . ( [ eq : hy ] ) becomes @xmath80 where @xmath81 with @xmath82 in this effective hamiltonian , we only take the first 7 modes into account .    on one hand the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hy1 ] ) can be given by the expansion of the following xy model approximately @xmath83 for @xmath84 with @xmath85 where ",
    "( g ) \" is used to denote the method of gauss approximation .",
    "this hamiltonian is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising ] ) obtained by dw method . if we regard eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising ] ) is a special form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hy1 ] ) with @xmath86 , it should have @xmath87 .",
    "we investigate the cases with different @xmath50 with fixed @xmath49 .",
    "the numerical results for matrix elements of @xmath88 and the couplings @xmath89 by dw method are shown in table 1 .",
    "as shown in table 1 and eq . (",
    "[ eq : kj ] ) , @xmath90 is satisfied even for @xmath91 in an error less than @xmath92 . for higher @xmath50 ,",
    "two methods agree with each other very well . at @xmath93 ,",
    "the relative difference between @xmath94 and @xmath94 is less than @xmath95 .",
    "in addition the couplings between next nearest neighbors are much smaller than the that between nearest neighbors , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "this indicates the approximation of nearest neighbors is good enough .",
    "moreover eq . ( [ eq : hy1 ] ) is the well - known josephson s junctions hamiltonian .",
