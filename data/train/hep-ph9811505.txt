    "we see that at a mass of 120  gev , already 10 events suffice to reveal a @xmath125 distribution , at the level of 9597% , with a risk of falsely rejecting the correct hypothesis , @xmath79 , of only 5% .",

    "we have studied the production of generic higgs particles in @xmath1 collisions , focusing on distributions which might be useful in distinguishing a @xmath0-even from a @xmath0-odd particle .",
    "longitudinal beam polarization effects are taken into account .",
    "we have not discussed backgrounds .",
    "these would depend on how the higgs boson is detected .",
    "a light higgs would dominantly decay to @xmath162 quarks , and the background would not be severe , mostly from single @xmath9 and @xmath10 production and the two - photon process @xcite .",
    "a heavier higgs would decay to @xmath10 and @xmath9 bosons , and the background would be a problem @xcite .    in the @xmath0-even case , the higgs particle tends to be softer , and events are more aligned with the beam direction than in the @xmath0-odd case .",
    "in fact , the higgs energy distribution may be one of the better observables for discriminating the two cases .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on the _ product _ of the two beam polarizations is much larger in the @xmath0-odd case .",
    "this dependence , which is represented by an observable @xmath110 , becomes a better `` discriminator '' for increasing higgs masses , when the higgs momentum decreases , and other methods may tend to become less efficient .",
    "if the two final - state electrons are observed , a certain azimuthal distribution , as well as the electron polar - angle distributions , will also be useful for discriminating the two cases .",
    "finally , we suggest ways to search for possible parity - violating effects in the @xmath139-higgs coupling .",
