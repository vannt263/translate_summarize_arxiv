    "<S> our goal is to approximate this computational black box with a neural network , trained to best represent @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> different possible choices for the artificial neural - network architectures have been proposed to solve specific tasks , and the best architecture to describe a many - body quantum system may vary from one case to another . for the sake of concreteness , in the following </S>",

    "<S> the network weights are , in general , to be taken complex - valued in order to provide a complete description of both the amplitude and the wave - function s phase .    </S>",

    "<S> the many - body wave function reasonably satisfies these requirements , we can expect the nqs form to be of broad applicability . </S>",
    "<S> one of the practical advantages of this representation is that its quality can , in principle , be systematically improved upon increasing the number of hidden variables . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath4 ( or equivalently the density @xmath18 ) then plays a role analogous to the bond dimension for the mps . </S>",

    "<S> another convenient point of the nqs representation is that it can be formulated in a symmetry - conserving fashion . </S>",
    "<S> for example , lattice translation symmetry can be used to reduce the number of variational parameters of the nqs ansatz , in the same spirit of shift - invariant rbm s @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we find that each filter @xmath35 $ ] learns specific correlation features emerging in the ground state wave function . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the 2d case it can be seen ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gs - networks ] , rightmost panels ) how the neural network learns patterns corresponding to anti - ferromagnetic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the general behavior of the nqs is completely analogous to what observed in convolutional neural networks , where different layers learn specific structures of the input data .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gs - accuracy ] we show the accuracy of the nqs states , quantified by the relative error on the ground - state energy @xmath36 , for several values of @xmath37 and model parameters . in the left panel </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the variational nqs energies with the exact result obtained by fermionization of the tfi model , on a one - dimensional chain with pbc . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking result is that nqs achieve a controllable and arbitrary accuracy which is compatible with a power - law behavior in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the hardest to learn ground - state is at the quantum critical point @xmath38 , where nonetheless a remarkable accuracy of one part per million can be easily achieved with a relatively modest density of hidden units . </S>",
    "<S> the same remarkable accuracy is obtained for the more complex one - dimensional afh model ( central panel ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we observe as well a systematic drop in the ground - state energy error , which for a small @xmath34 attains the same very high precision obtained for the tfi model at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared with the accuracy obtained with the spin - jastrow ansatz ( dashed line in the central panel ) , which we improve by several orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to compare the value of @xmath37 with the mps bond dimension @xmath4 , needed to reach the same level of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> for example , on the afh model with pbc , we find that with a standard dmrg implementation @xcite we need @xmath39 to reach the accuracy we have at @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this points towards a more compact representation of the many - body state in the nqs case , which features about @xmath40 orders of magnitude less variational parameters than the corresponding mps ansatz .    </S>",
    "<S> we next study the afh model on a two - dimensional square lattice , comparing in the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gs - accuracy ] to qmc results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from entanglement considerations , the 2d case proves harder for the nqs . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we always find a systematic improvement of the variational energy upon increasing @xmath37 , qualitatively similar to the 1d case . </S>",
    "<S> the increased difficulty of the problem is reflected in a slower convergence . </S>",
    "<S> we still obtain results at the level of existing state - of - the - art methods or better . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , with a relatively small hidden unit density @xmath41 we already obtain results at the same level than the best known variational ansatz to - date for finite clusters ( the eps of ref . @xcite and the peps states of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> further increasing @xmath37 then leads to a sizable improvement and consequently yields the best variational results so - far - reported for this 2d model on finite lattices .    [ </S>",

    "<S> we compare our results with the analytical solution obtained from fermionization of the tfi model for a one - dimensional chain with pbc . in the left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : time - accuracy ] the exact results for the time - dependent transverse spin polarization are compared to nqs with @xmath34 . in the afh model , we study instead quantum quenches in the longitudinal coupling @xmath51 and monitor the time evolution of the nearest - neighbors correlations . our results for the time evolution ( and with @xmath34 ) </S>",
    "<S> are compared with the numerically - exact mps dynamics @xcite for a system with open boundaries ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : time - accuracy ] , right panel ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the high accuracy obtained also for the unitary dynamics further confirms that neural network - based approaches can be fruitfully used to solve the quantum many - body problem not only for ground - state properties but also to model the evolution induced by a complex set of excited quantum states . </S>",
