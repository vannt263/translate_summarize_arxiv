    "computers have changed the world in many ways . they are ubiquitous , running air - traffic control and manufacturing plants , providing movie special effects and video games , and serving as a substrate for electronic mail and the world wide web .",
    "while computers allow us to solve many problems that were simply impossible before their advent , a number of problems require too much computation to be practical even for relatively simple inputs , and using the most powerful computers .",
    "the field of classical complexity theory has developed to classify problems by their difficulty .",
    "a class of problems is generally considered tractable if an algorithm exists to solve it with resources ( such as time and memory ) polynomial in the size of the input .",
    "two well - known classically intractable problems are factoring an @xmath0-bit number and the traveling salesman problem ( finding the minimum cyclic path connecting @xmath0 cities with specified distances between them ) .",
    "both of these problems are in the complexity class np ( for `` non - deterministic polynomial '' ) : given a black box that solves the problem ( an _ oracle _ ) , we can check in polynomial time that the solution is correct .",
    "the traveling salesman problem is an np - complete problem ; that is , any problem in np can be transformed into an instance of the traveling salesman problem in polynomial time . if we can solve the traveling salesman problem in polynomial time , we can solve any np problem in polynomial time .",
    "factoring may or may not be np - complete , but so much work has been done attempting to solve it that the consensus is that it is classically intractable , and rsa public - key cryptography , which is used , for instance , to send credit - card numbers in web browsing software , depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers .",
    "as computer hardware develops over time , the underlying technology continually changes to become faster , smaller , and generally better .",
    "what was impossible on yesterday s computers may be quite possible today .",
    "a problem that was intractable on the earlier hardware might become tractable with the new technology .",
    "the strong church - turing thesis @xcite states that this is not the case , and that every physical implementation of universal computation can simulate any other implementation with only a polynomial slowdown . in this way",
    ", the church - turing thesis protects complexity theory from obsolescence as computer technology improves .",
    "while a new computer may be able to factor larger numbers , the difficulty of factoring numbers will still scale the same way with the size of the input on the new hardware as on the old hardware .",
    "another problem that has proven to be classically intractable is simulating quantum systems .",
    "a single spin-1/2 particle , such as an electron trapped in a quantum dot , has a two - dimensional space of states , which can be considered to describe the direction of its spin .",
    "a similar classical particle such as a heisenberg spin would also have a two - dimensional space of states .",
    "however , @xmath0 quantum particles have a @xmath1-dimensional state space , while @xmath0 classical heisenberg spins would only have a @xmath2-dimensional space of states .",
    "the extra states in the quantum system come from the presence of entangled states between many different particles .",
    "note that while an @xmath0-bit classical digital computer has @xmath1 possible states , they only form an @xmath0-dimensional state space , since a state can be described by an @xmath0-component binary vector . to describe a state in a quantum computer with @xmath0 qubits",
    "requires a complex vector with @xmath1 components .",
    "i give a basic introduction to quantum mechanics in section  [ sec - qm ] .",
    "quantum systems are difficult to simulate classically because they generically utilize the full @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space as they evolve , requiring exponential classical resources .",
    "this fact led feynman to conjecture that a quantum computer which used quantum mechanics intrinsically might be more powerful than a computer mired in the classical world  @xcite .",
    "while this seems a sensible suggestion when just looking at quantum mechanics , it is in fact quite revolutionary in that it suggests that the strong church - turing thesis is wrong !",
    "this opens up the possibility that classical complexity classes might not apply for quantum computers , and that some classically intractable problems might become tractable .",
    "the most spectacular instance of this is shor s discovery of an algorithm to factor numbers on a quantum computer in a polynomial time in the number of digits  @xcite .",
    "another impressive algorithm is grover s algorithm  @xcite , which can find a single object in an unsorted database of @xmath3 objects in @xmath4 time on a quantum computer , while the same task would require an exhaustive search on a classical computer , taking @xmath5 time .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath4 time is the best possible speed for this task @xcite , which tends to suggest that np - complete problems are still intractable on a quantum computer , although this has not been shown ( note that a proof of this would also show @xmath6 for a classical computer ) .",
    "however , declaring by theoretical fiat the basic properties of a quantum computer is a far cry from actually building one and using it to factor large numbers .",
    "nevertheless , the first steps in building a quantum computer have been taken .",
    "any quantum computer requires a system with long - lived quantum states and a way to interact them . typically , we consider systems comprised of a number of two - state subsystems , which are called _ qubits _ ( for `` quantum bits '' ) .",
    "there are many proposals for how to build a quantum computer .",
    "some possible physical realizations of qubits are :    * the ground and excited states of ions stored in a linear ion trap , with interactions between ions provided through a joint vibrational mode  @xcite .",
    "* photons in either polarization , with interactions via cavity qed  @xcite . * nuclear spin states in polymers , with interactions provided by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques  @xcite .    while these implementations are seemingly very different , it is possible to simulate the computational process of one system on any of the others , providing a quantum analogue to the church - turing thesis ( although there are difficult technical or theoretical problems with scaling up the size of these implementations ) .",
    "these suggested implementations of quantum computers all share a much higher susceptibility to errors than modern classical computers . while further development may reduce the size of errors by orders of magnitude , it is unlikely that quantum computers will ever reach the incredible reliability of classical computers .",
    "modern classical computers guard against error largely by being digital instead of analog  instead of allowing each bit of the computer to vary continuously between 0 and 1 , at each time step the hardware kicks the bit back to the nearer of 0 and 1 .",
    "this prevents small errors from building up into large errors , which are therefore drastically reduced .",
    "the same technique can not be used in a quantum computer , because continually measuring each qubit would destroy the entangled states that distinguish a quantum computer from a classical computer .",
    "entangled states are in general very delicate , and making a measurement on one will typically collapse it into a less entangled state .",
    "small interactions with the environment provide a sort of continuous measurement of a system , and as the system grows in size , these become harder and harder to ignore .",
    "the system will _ decohere _ and begin to look like a classical system .",
    "decoherence is why the world looks classical at a human scale .",
    "reducing interactions with the environment can reduce the effects of decoherence , but not eliminate them entirely .",
    "even if the basal error rate in a quantum computer can be reduced to some small value @xmath7 per unit time , after @xmath3 time steps , the probability of surviving without an error is only @xmath8 , which decreases exponentially with @xmath3 .",
    "even if an algorithm runs in polynomial time on an error - free computer , it will require exponentially many runs on a real computer unless something can be done to control the errors .",
    "the same problem occurs for classical computers .",
    "there , the problem can be solved in principle by the use of error - correcting codes . in practice , they are not usually necessary for normal computer operation , but they are essential to overcome noise in communications channels .",
    "i give a basic introduction to the theory of classical error - correcting codes in section  [ sec - classical ] .",
    "classical error - correction techniques can not be directly carried over to quantum computers for two reasons .",
    "first of all , the classical techniques assume we can measure all of the bits in the computer .",
    "for a quantum computer , this would destroy any entanglement between qubits .",
    "more importantly , a classical computer only needs to preserve the bit values of 0 and 1 .",
    "a quantum computer also needs to keep phase information in entangled states .",
    "thus , while quantum error - correcting codes are related to classical codes , they require a somewhat new approach .",
    "the first quantum error - correcting codes were discovered by shor  @xcite and steane  @xcite .",
    "i discuss shor s original code and some basics of quantum error - correcting codes in chapter  [ chap - basics ] .",
    "i then go on to describe the formalism of stabilizer codes in chapter  [ chap - stabilizers ] , along with some simple examples and methods for creating new codes from old ones .",
    "chapter  [ chap - encoding ] describes how to build networks to encode and decode stabilizer codes . because we will want to use these codes in the operation of quantum computers , in chapter  [ chap - fault - tolerant ] ,",
    "i will discuss how to perform operations on states encoded using a quantum error - correcting code without losing the protection against errors .",
    "chapter  [ chap - concatenation ] describes how to use concatenated codes to do arbitrarily long calculations as long as the basic error rate is below some threshhold value , and presents a rough calculation of that threshhold .",
    "chapter  [ chap - bounds ] discusses known upper and lower bounds on the existence of stabilizer codes and the channel capacity . finally , in chapter  [ chap - examples ]",
    ", i will give a partial list of known quantum error - correcting codes and their properties .",
    "appendix  [ app - gates ] contains a brief discussion of quantum gates and a list of symbols for them used in figures .",
    "appendix  [ app - glossary ] contains a glossary of useful terms for discussing quantum error - correcting codes .",
    "since the promise of quantum computation has attracted scientists from a number of fields , including computer science , mathematics , and physics , some of the background one group takes for granted may be alien to others .",
    "therefore , in the following two sections , i have provided basic introductions to quantum mechanics and classical coding theory .",
    "people familiar with one or both fields should skip the appropriate section(s ) . for a more complete treatment of quantum mechanics , see  @xcite . for a more complete treatment of classical error - correcting codes , see  @xcite .",
    "the state of a classical computer is a string of 0s and 1s , which is a vector over the finite field @xmath9 .",
    "the state of a quantum computer ( or any quantum system ) is instead a vector over the complex numbers @xmath10 .",
    "actually , a quantum state lies in a hilbert space , since there is an inner product ( which i will define later ) . the state is usually written @xmath11 , which is called a _ ket_. a classical computer with @xmath0 bits has @xmath1 possible states , but this is only an @xmath0-dimensional vector space over @xmath9 . a quantum computer with @xmath0 qubits is a state in a @xmath1-dimensional complex vector space .",
    "for a single qubit , the standard basis vectors are written as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "an arbitrary single - qubit state is then @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 are complex numbers , with @xmath17 .",
    "this is a _",
    "normalized _ state .",
    "with multiple qubits , we can have states that can not be written as the product of single - qubit states .",
    "for instance , @xmath18 can not be decomposed in this way .",
    "such a state is said to be _",
    "entangled states are what provide a quantum computer with its power .",
    "they will also play a major role in quantum error correction .",
    "the particular state ( [ eq-2qubit ] ) is called an einstein - podalsky - rosen pair ( or epr ) pair , and serves as a useful basic unit of entanglement in many applications .",
    "if we make a measurement on the qubit in equation ( [ eq-1qubit ] ) , we get a classical number corresponding to one of the basis states .",
    "the measurement disturbs the original state , which collapses into the basis state corresponding to the measurement outcome .",
    "if we measure the state  ( [ eq-1qubit ] ) , the outcome will be 0 with probability @xmath19 , and it will be 1 with probability @xmath20 .",
    "the normalization ensures that the probability of getting some result is exactly 1 . through most of this thesis",
    ", i will instead write down unnormalized states . these states will stand for the corresponding normalized states , which are formed by multiplying the unnormalized states by an appropriate constant .",
    "the overall phase of a state vector has no physical significance .",
    "the measurement we made implements one of two projection operators , the projections on the basis @xmath21 .",
    "this is not the only measurement we can make on a single qubit . in fact , we can project on any basis for the hilbert space of the qubit .",
    "if we have multiple qubits , we can measure a number of different qubits independently , or we can measure some joint property of the qubits , which corresponds to projecting on some entangled basis of the system .",
    "note that the projection on the basis @xmath21 for either qubit destroys the entanglement of the state ( [ eq-2qubit ] ) , leaving it in a tensor product state .",
    "a particularly fruitful way to understand a quantum system is to look at the behavior of various operators acting on the states of the system .",
    "for instance , a nice set of operators to consider for a single qubit is the set of pauli spin matrices @xmath22 the original measurement i described corresponds to measuring the eigenvalue of @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding projection operators are @xmath24 .",
    "if we have a spin-@xmath25 particle , this measurement is performed by measuring the spin of the particle along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "we could also measure along the @xmath27 or @xmath28 axis , which corresponds to measuring the eigenvalue of @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the projections are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we can also make measurements of more general operators , provided they have real eigenvalues .",
    "a matrix @xmath33 has real eigenvalues iff it is hermitian : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the _",
    "hermitian adjoint _",
    "( or just _ adjoint _ ) , equal to the complex conjugate transpose .",
    "note that all of the pauli spin matrices are hermitian .",
    "the pauli matrices also satisfy an important algebraic property  they _ anticommute _ with each other .",
    "that is , @xmath36 whenever @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 ) .",
    "another possible relationship between two operators @xmath33 and @xmath39 is for them to _",
    "commute_. that is , @xmath40 = a b - b a = 0.\\ ] ] it is possible for two matrices to neither commute nor anticommute , and , in fact , this is the generic case .",
    "two commuting matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "this means that we can measure the eigenvalue of one of them without disturbing the eigenvectors of the other .",
    "conversely , if two operators do not commute , measuring one will disturb the eigenvectors of the other , so we can not simultaneously measure non - commuting operators .",
    "there is a natural complex inner product on quantum states .",
    "given an orthonormal basis @xmath41 , the inner product between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is @xmath44 each ket @xmath11 corresponds to a _ bra _ @xmath45 and",
    "the hermitian adjoint is the adjoint with respect to this inner product , so @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "the operator @xmath48 acts on the hilbert space as follows : @xmath49 the inner product can reveal a great deal of information about the structure of a set of states .",
    "for instance , @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 .    eigenvectors of a hermitian operator @xmath33 with different eigenvalues are automatically orthogonal : @xmath52 since the eigenvalues of @xmath33 are real , it follows that @xmath53 whenever @xmath54 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath53 , there exists a hermitian operator for which @xmath11 and @xmath55 are eigenvectors with different eigenvalues .",
    "we often want to consider a subsystem @xmath56 of a quantum system @xmath57 . since @xmath56 may be entangled with the rest of the system , it is not meaningful to speak of the `` state '' of @xmath56",
    ". if we write the state of @xmath57 as @xmath58 , where @xmath41 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are possible states for @xmath56 , then to an observer who only interacts with the subsystem @xmath56 , the subsystem appears to be in just one of the states @xmath60 with some probability .",
    "@xmath56 is said to be in a _",
    "mixed state _ as opposed to the _ pure state _ of a closed system in a definite state .",
    "we can extend the formalism to cover mixed states by introducing the _ density matrix _ @xmath61 .",
    "for a pure system in the state @xmath11 , the density matrix is @xmath62 .",
    "the density matrix for the subsystem for the entangled state above is @xmath63 .",
    "density matrices are always positive and have @xmath64 . to find the density matrix of a subsystem given the density matrix of the full system , simply trace over the degrees of freedom of the rest of the system .    given a closed quantum system , time evolution preserves the inner product , so the time evolution operator @xmath65 must be unitary .",
    "that is , @xmath66 .",
    "an open system can be described as a subsystem of a larger closed system , so the evolution of the open system descends from the global evolution of the full system .",
    "time evolution of the subsystem is described by some _ superoperator _ acting on the density matrix of the subsystem .",
    "one fact about quantum states that has profound implications for quantum computation is that it is impossible to make a copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state .",
    "this is known as the `` no cloning theorem , '' @xcite and is a consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics .",
    "the proof is straightforward : suppose we wish to have an operation that maps an arbitrary state @xmath67 then arbitrary @xmath55 is mapped by @xmath68 as well . because the transformation must be linear , it follows that @xmath69 however , @xmath70 so we have failed to copy @xmath71 . in general , if we pick an orthonormal basis , we can copy the basis states , but we will not have correctly copied superpositions of those basis states . we will instead have either measured the original system and therefore destroyed the superposition , or we will have produced a state that is entangled between the original and the `` copy . ''",
    "this means that to perform quantum error correction , we can not simply make backup copies of the quantum state to be preserved .",
    "instead , we must protect the original from any likely error .",
    "classical coding theory tends to concentrate on _ linear codes _ , a subclass of all possible codes with a particular relation between codewords .",
    "suppose we wish to encode @xmath72 bits using @xmath0 bits .",
    "the data can be represented as a @xmath72-dimensional binary vector @xmath73 . because we are dealing with binary vectors ,",
    "all the arithmetic is mod two . for a linear code ,",
    "the encoded data is then @xmath74 for some @xmath75 matrix @xmath76 ( with entries from @xmath9 ) , which is independent of @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath76 is called the _ generator matrix _ for the code .",
    "its columns form a basis for the @xmath72-dimensional coding subspace of the @xmath0-dimensional binary vector space , and represent basis codewords .",
    "the most general possible codeword is an arbitrary linear combination of the basis codewords ; thus the name `` linear code . ''    given a generator matrix @xmath76 , we can calculate the dual matrix @xmath77 , which is an @xmath78 matrix of 0s and 1s of maximal rank @xmath79 with @xmath80 . since any codeword @xmath81 has the form @xmath74 , @xmath82 , and @xmath77 annihilates any codeword .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath77 has rank @xmath79 , it only annihilates a @xmath72-dimensional space spanned by the columns of @xmath76 , and @xmath81 must be a linear combination of these columns .",
    "thus , @xmath84 for some @xmath73 , and @xmath81 is a valid codeword .",
    "the matrix @xmath77 is called the _ parity check matrix _ for the code .",
    "it can be used to test if a given vector is a valid codeword , since @xmath83 iff @xmath81 is a codeword .",
    "the _ dual code _ is defined to be the code with generator matrix @xmath85 and parity matrix @xmath86 .    in order to consider the error - correcting properties of a code , it is useful to look at the _ hamming distance _ between codewords .",
    "the hamming distance between two vectors is the minimum number of bits that must be flipped to convert one vector to the other .",
    "the distance between @xmath87 and @xmath88 is equal to the _ weight _ ( the number of 1s in the vector ) of @xmath89 . for a code to correct @xmath90 single - bit errors , it must have distance at least @xmath91 between any two codewords . a @xmath90 bit error",
    "will take a codeword exactly distance @xmath90 away from its original value , so when the distance between codewords is at least @xmath91 , we can distinguish errors on different codewords and correct them to the proper codewords . a code to encode @xmath72 bits in @xmath0 bits with minimum distance @xmath92",
    "is said to be an @xmath93 $ ] code .",
    "now suppose we consider a @xmath90 bit error .",
    "we can write down a vector @xmath94 to describe this vector by putting ones in the places where bits are flipped and zeros elsewhere . then if the original codeword is @xmath81 , after the error it is @xmath95 .",
    "if we apply the parity check matrix , we get @xmath96 so the value of @xmath97 does not depend on the value of @xmath81 , only on @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath98 is different for all possible errors @xmath94 , we will be able to determine precisely what error occurred and fix it .",
    "@xmath98 is called the _ error syndrome _ , since it tells us what the error is . since @xmath99 iff @xmath100 , to have a code of distance @xmath92 , we need @xmath101 for all vectors @xmath94 of weight @xmath102 or less .",
    "equivalently , any @xmath102 columns of @xmath77 must be linearly independent .",
    "we can place upper and lower bounds on the existence of linear codes to correct @xmath90 errors .",
    "each of the @xmath103 codewords has a _ hamming sphere _ of radius @xmath90 .",
    "all the words inside the hamming sphere come from errors acting on the same codeword . for a code on @xmath0 bits , there are @xmath0 one - bit errors , two - bit errors , and in general @xmath104-bit errors .",
    "the hamming spheres can not overlap , but they must all fit inside the vector space , which only has @xmath1 elements . thus , @xmath105 this is called the _ hamming bound _ on @xmath106 $ ] codes . as @xmath0 , @xmath72 , and @xmath90 get large , this bound approaches the asymptotic form @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the _ hamming entropy _ @xmath109    we can set a lower bound on the existence of @xmath106 $ ] linear codes as well , called the _ gilbert - varshamov _ bound .",
    "suppose we have such a code ( if necessary with @xmath110 ) with @xmath111 then the spheres of distance @xmath112 around each codeword do not fill the space , so there is some vector @xmath73 that is at least distance @xmath113 from each of the other codewords .",
    "in addition , @xmath114 ( for any codeword @xmath81 ) is at least distance @xmath113 from any other codeword @xmath115 , since the distance is just @xmath116 , which is the distance between @xmath73 and the codeword @xmath117 .",
    "this means that we can add @xmath73 and all the vectors @xmath118 to the code without dropping the distance below @xmath119 .",
    "this gives us an @xmath120 $ ] code .",
    "we can continue this process until @xmath121 asymptotically , this becomes @xmath122    another case of great interest is the capacity of a classical channel .",
    "this is equal to the _ efficiency _ @xmath123 of the most efficient code on an asymptotically large block that corrects measure one of the errors occuring .",
    "for instance , a common channel is the _ binary symmetric channel _ , where an error occurs independently on each bit with probability @xmath124 for both @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "shannon showed that channel capacity is just equal to one minus the entropy introduced by the channel  @xcite .",
    "for the binary symmetric channel , the entropy is just the hamming entropy @xmath127 , so the capacity is @xmath128 , coinciding with the hamming bound for the expected number of errors @xmath129 .",
    "shannon also showed that the capacity of a channel can be achieved by choosing codewords at random , then discarding only a few of them ( measure zero asymptotically ) .",
    "now we turn to the quantum channel . a noisy quantum channel can be a regular communications channel which we expect to preserve at least some degree of quantum coherence , or it can be the passage of time as a set of qubits sits around , interacting with its environment , or it can be the result of operating with a noisy gate on some qubits in a quantum computer . in any of these cases , the input of a pure quantum state can produce a mixed state as output as the data qubits become entangled with the environment .",
    "even when a pure state comes out , it might not be the same state as the one that went in .",
    "at first it appears that trying to correct a mixed state back into the correct pure state is going to be harder than correcting an erroneous pure state , but this is not the case .",
    "the output mixed state can be considered as an ensemble of pure states .",
    "if we can correct each of the pure states in the ensemble back to the original input state , we have corrected the full mixed state .",
    "another way of phrasing this is to say the channel applies a superoperator to the input density matrix .",
    "we can diagonalize this superoperator and write it as the direct sum of a number of different matrices acting directly on the possible input pure states with various probabilities .",
    "if the code can correct any of the possible matrices , it can correct the full superoperator .",
    "a key point is that the individual matrices need not be unitary . from now on",
    ", i will only consider the effects of a ( possibly non - unitary ) matrix acting on a pure state .",
    "for the moment , let us consider only channels which cause an error on a single qubit at a time .",
    "we wish to protect a single logical qubit against error .",
    "we can not send it through the channel as is , because the one qubit that is affected might be the one we want to keep .",
    "suppose we send through nine qubits after encoding the logical qubit as follows : @xmath130 the data is no longer stored in a single qubit , but instead spread out among nine of them .",
    "note that even if we know the nine qubits are in one of these two states , we can not determine which one without making a measurement on at least three qubits .",
    "this code is due to shor  @xcite .",
    "suppose the channel flips a single qubit , say the first one , switching @xmath12 and @xmath13 . then by comparing the first two qubits , we find they are different , which is not allowed for any valid codeword . therefore we know an error occurred , and furthermore , it flipped either the first or second qubit .",
    "note that we do not actually measure the first and second qubits , since this would destroy the superposition in the codeword ; we just measure the difference between them .",
    "now we compare the first and third qubits .",
    "since the first qubit was flipped , it will disagree with the third ; if the second qubit had been flipped , the first and third would have agreed .",
    "therefore , we have narrowed down the error to the first qubit and we can fix it simply by flipping it back . to handle possible bit flips on the other blocks of three ,",
    "we do the same comparisons inside the other blocks .",
    "however , this is not the only sort of error that could have occurred .",
    "the channel might have left the identity of the 0 and 1 alone , but altered their relative phase , introducing , for instance , a relative factor of @xmath131 when the first qubit is @xmath13 .",
    "then the two basis states become @xmath132 by comparing the sign of the first block of three with the second block of three , we can see that a sign error has occurred in one of those blocks . then by comparing the signs of the first and third blocks of three , we narrow the sign error down to the first block , and flip the sign back to what it should be .",
    "again , we do not want to actually measure the signs , only whether they agree . in this case , measuring the signs would give us information about whether the state is @xmath133 or @xmath134 , which would destroy any superposition between them .",
    "this does not exhaust the list of possible one qubit errors .",
    "for instance , we could have both a bit flip and a sign flip on the same qubit .",
    "however , by going through both processes described above , we will fix first the bit flip , then the sign flip ( in fact , this code will correct a bit flip and a sign flip even if they are on different qubits ) .",

    "if we can correct errors @xmath155 and @xmath156 , we can correct @xmath157 , so we only need to consider whether the code can correct a basis of errors .",
    "one convenient basis to use is the set of tensor products of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath145 .",

    "@xmath159 will play a major role in the stabilizer formalism .",
    "sometimes i will write it @xmath160 to distinguish the groups for different numbers of qubits .",
    "@xmath161 is just the quaternionic group ; @xmath160 is the direct product of @xmath0 copies of the quaternions modulo all but a global phase factor .    in order for the code to correct two errors @xmath162 and @xmath163 , we must always be able to distinguish error @xmath162 acting on one basis codeword @xmath41 from error @xmath163 acting on a different basis codeword @xmath164 .",

    "if we have a channel in which we are certain _ some _ error occurred , we do not need to include the identity as a possible error . in any case , the set of correctable errors is unlikely to be a group  it does not even need to be closed under multiplication .",
    "however , ( [ eq - cond - orthogonal ] ) is insufficient to guarantee a code will work as a quantum error - correcting code .",
    "when we make a measurement to find out about the error , we must learn nothing about the actual state of the code within the coding space .",
    "if we did learn something , we would be disturbing superpositions of the basis states , so while we might correct the basis states , we would not be correcting an arbitrary valid codeword .",
    "we learn information about the error by measuring @xmath168 for all possible errors @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",

    "it is also a sufficient condition : the matrix @xmath171 is hermitian , so it can be diagonalized .",
    "if we do this and rescale the errors @xmath172 appropriately , we get a new basis @xmath173 for the space of possible errors , with either @xmath174 or @xmath175 depending on @xmath87 .",

    "errors of the second type actually annihilate any codeword , so the probability of one occuring is strictly zero and we need not consider them",

    ", we only need distinguish @xmath162 from those @xmath163 affecting the same qubits .",
    "this means that @xmath186 has the same weight as @xmath162 , and to correct @xmath187 such located errors , we need a code of distance at least @xmath188 .",
    "we can also imagine combining all of these tasks .",
    "a code to correct @xmath90 arbitrary errors , @xmath187 additional located errors , and detect a further @xmath81 errors must have distance at least @xmath189 .      in this thesis",

    "the normal error correction networks will not function properly , since they assume that the qubit is either in the state @xmath12 or @xmath13 . however , by performing some measurement that distinguishes between the computational hilbert space and other possible states , we can determine not only that this sort of _ leakage error _ has occurred , but also on which qubit it has occurred . then we can cool the atom to the ground state or introduce a new photon with random polarization , and the error becomes a located error , which was discussed at the end of the previous section .",

    "while this can in principle be a severe problem , it can be handled without a change in formalism as long as the chance of a correlated error drops rapidly enough with the size of the blocks of errors . since a @xmath90-qubit error will occur with probability @xmath191 when the probability of uncorrelated single - qubit errors is @xmath7 , as long as the probability of a @xmath90-qubit correlated error is @xmath191 , the correlated errors cause no additional problems .    in real systems ,",

    "for instance , when the qubits are ground or excited states of an ion , a likely source of errors is spontaneous emission . after some amount of time , the excited state will either decay to the ground state , producing the error @xmath192 with probability @xmath7 , or it will not , which changes the relative amplitudes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , resulting in the error @xmath193 with probability @xmath194 .",

    "stabilizer : :    the set of tensor products of pauli matrices that fix every state in    the coding space .",
    "the stabilizer is an abelian subgroup of the group    @xmath159 defined in section  [ sec - general - prop ] .",
    "the    stabilizer contains all of the vital information about a code . in    particular ,",
    "operators in @xmath159 that anticommute    with some element of the stabilizer can be detected by the code .",
    "stabilizer code : :    a quantum code that can be described by giving its stabilizer . also    called an additive code or a gf(4 ) code .",
    "teleportation : :    a process whereby a quantum state is destroyed and exactly    reconstructed elsewhere .",
    "quantum teleportation of a single qubit    requires one epr pair shared between the source and destination , and    involves two measurements on the source qubit .",
    "the two bits from the    measurements must be classically transmitted to the destination in    order to reconstruct the original quantum state .",
    "threshhold : :    the error rate below which a suitably configured quantum computer can    be used to perform arbitrarily long computations .",
    "current methods for    proving the existence of a threshhold use concatenated codes .",
    "most    estimates of the threshhold lie in the range @xmath218",
    "    @xmath219 .",
    "transversal operation : :    an operation applied in parallel to the various qubits in a block of a    quantum error - correcting code .",
    "qubits from one block can only interact    with corresponding qubits from another block or from an ancilla .",
    "any    transversal operation is automatically fault - tolerant .",
    "weight : :    a property of operators only defined on operators which can be written    as the tensor product of single - qubit operators .",
    "for such an operator ,    the weight is the number of single - qubit operators in the product that    are not equal to the identity .",
    "weight enumerator : :    a polynomial whose coefficients @xmath220 are the number of    elements of weight @xmath0 in some set , such as the stabilizer    or the normalizer of the stabilizer .",
    "weight enumerators are very    helpful in setting bounds on the possible existence of quantum    error - correcting codes through identities such as the quantum    macwilliams identities ( equation ( [ eq - qmw ] ) ) .",
