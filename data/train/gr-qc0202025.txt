    "although these theories have explained several important features of our universe fundamental questions still remain to be answered  @xcite .",
    "models in lower dimensions offer interesting results that , if properly analyzed , can be used to gain insight in the realistic formulations .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2-d ) gravity models have been under intensive investigation during the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "the old problem of quantum gravity , black holes physics and string dynamics were tested in these theories .",
    "in particular teitelboim  @xcite and jackiw  @xcite proposed a consistent model in two dimensions analogous of general relativity .",
    "as imediate results , among others  @xcite , this model offer a consistent newtonian limit , gravitational collapse solutions that are basically a 2-d schwarzschild analogue and cosmological models based in a 2-d robertson - walker metric .    for cosmological applications , a refinement in the construction of these models can be obtained by considering a non - equilibrium scenario , including a bulk viscosity term in the energy - momentum tensor ( for a review on viscous cosmology up to 1990 one is referred to gron  @xcite ) . in the four - dimensional case the inclusion of this term to analyze the evolution of the cosmic scale factor with the time was done by murphy  @xcite who has found a solution that corresponds only to an expansion .",
    "other models were based on the coupling of the einstein field equations with the balance equations of extended thermodynamics  @xcite ( also known as causal or second - order thermodynamic theory ) and among others we cite the works of belinski et al  @xcite , zimdahl  @xcite and di prisco et al  @xcite .    in this work",

    "the difference between the solutions in the four- and two - dimensional cases is due to the fact that the relationship between the metric tensor and the sources in the 2-d case is modified because the einstein field equations give no dynamics for the 2-d case .",

    "iv we introduce the gravitational equations of motion in the 2-d case and in section v we search for the solutions of the gravitational field equations .",
    "finally , in section vi we discuss the solutions that came out from the gravitational field equations .",
    "one fundamental feature of 2-d cosmological models is that they show considerably less mathematical complexity and at the same time they preserve the physical principles that are used to construct their four - dimensional counterparts .",
    "one impressive result was that in 2-d models the quantization of the gravitational field is consistent  @xcite , opening the possibility of quantum cosmological models for the very early universe .",
    "these results in the 2-d theories are of relevance to include new ingredients in the `` realistic '' versions  @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the so - called cosmological principle is based on the assumption that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the metric that describes such kind of universe , known as the robertson - walker metric , has the following form in a two - dimensional riemannian space characterized by the metric tensor @xmath0 with signature @xmath1  @xcite ds^2=(cdt)^2-(t)^2(dr)^21-r^2 . in the above equation @xmath2 - the so - called cosmic scale factor -",
    "is an unknown function of the time and has dimension of length , while @xmath3 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "if we introduce a new variable @xmath4 the equation ( [ rw1 ] ) reduces to ds^2=(cdt)^2-(t)^2(dx)^2 .    the components and the determinant @xmath5 of the metric tensor @xmath6 for the robertson - walker metric ( [ rw1 ] ) with respect to the coordinates @xmath7 are g_00=g^00=1,g_11=-^2 = 1g^11,g=^2 the corresponding non - zero christoffel symbols read _ 11 ^ 0=,_01 ^ 1=. where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "once the christoffel symbols are known the non - vanishing components of the ricci tensor @xmath9 and the curvature scalar @xmath10 can be calculated and it follows r_00=,r_11=- , r=2 .",

    ".      we shall determine in this section the dynamic pressure and the entropy production rate in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "in the four - dimensional case these topics were discussed by weinberg  @xcite within the framework of a phenomenological theory and by bernstein  @xcite within the framework of a kinetic theory of gases . without loss of generality",
    ", we shall use here the anderson and witting model of the boltzmann equation ( [ 1 ] ) in order to simplify the calculations .",
    "we begin by neglecting the space gradients - since we are dealing with a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe - and by considering a comoving frame where @xmath43 in a two - dimensional space .",
    "hence it follows that the boltzmann equation ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to -2pfp=-1c(f - f^ ( 0 ) ) .",
    "we use now the chapman and enskog method ( see for example  @xcite ) and search for a solution of the boltzmann equation ( [ 12.65 ] ) of the form f = f^(0)(1 + ) , where @xmath18 is the maxwell - jttner distribution function ( [ 35 ] ) and @xmath44 is the deviation from equilibrium of the one - particle distribution function .",
    "we insert the above representation into the boltzmann equation ( [ 12.65 ] ) and by taking into account only the derivatives of the maxwell - jttner distribution function we get that the deviation @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 = -c . for the elimination of @xmath47 and @xmath48 from ( [ 12.70 ] ) we use the balance equations of the particle flow and energy - momentum tensor of a non - viscous and non - heat - conducting relativistic gas whose constitutive equations read : n^=nu^,t^=(ne+p)u^u^c^2-pg^. insertion of the above representations into the balance equations @xmath49 and @xmath50 lead to ( nu^)=0 , -px^g^+1 x^+(ne+p)_^=0 . in a comoving frame (",
    "[ 12.74 ] ) becomes = - , while the spatial components of ( [ 12.75 ] ) are identically satisfied due to the constraint that all quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 are only functions of the time coordinate .",
    "the temporal component of ( [ 12.75 ] ) can be written as = -kc_v , where the heat capacity per particle at constant volume @xmath39 is given by ( [ 37])@xmath53 .",
    "equations ( [ 12.76 ] ) and ( [ 12.77 ] ) are used to eliminate @xmath47 and @xmath48 from ( [ 12.70 ] ) , yielding = c.    once the non - equilibrium distribution function ( [ 12.66 ] ) is known it is possible to calculate the projection of the energy - momentum tensor in a comoving frame which corresponds to the sum of the hydrostatic pressure with the dynamic pressure , i.e. , p+=-_t^=-(g_- u_u_c^2)cp^p^f = c^3p^2f dpp_0 .",
    "we insert ( [ 12.66 ] ) together with ( [ 12.70a ] ) into ( [ 12.71 ] ) and integrate the resulting equation , yielding = -c,= -p\\{^2 - 1 - 1c_v}. in the above equation @xmath54 denotes the integral for the modified bessel functions ( see abramowitz and stegun  @xcite p. 483 ) : _ n()=_^_n-1(t)dt= _ 0^dt .",
    "hence we have identified the coefficient of proportionality between @xmath30 and @xmath55 as the bulk viscosity @xmath56 .",
    "if we compare ( [ 12.79 ] ) with the constitutive equation for the dynamic pressure , given in terms of the divergence of the two - velocity , i.e. , @xmath57 , we infer that here @xmath58 plays the same role as @xmath59 . furthermore due to the fact that the bulk viscosity is a positive quantity the dynamic pressure decreases when the universe is expanding ( @xmath60 ) while it increases when the universe is contracting ( @xmath61 ) .    as in the four - dimensional case the coefficient of bulk viscosity vanishes in the non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic limiting cases .",
    "this can be seen from figure 1 where the coefficient of bulk viscosity @xmath62 is plotted versus the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "here we have chosen the following expression for the characteristic time  @xcite = 1nv_s , v_s= , where @xmath64 is a differential cross - section and @xmath65 the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "if we consider that the distribution function is given by ( [ 12.70 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath66 , we can use the approximation @xmath67 valid for @xmath68 in order to write the entropy production rate ( [ 10 ] ) in a comoving frame as = kf^(0)^2dp .",
    "we insert now ( [ 12.66 ] ) together with ( [ 12.70a ] ) into ( [ 12.81 ] ) and get by integrating the resulting equation = c^2t()^2 .",
    "hence the entropy production rate is connected with the bulk viscosity .",
    "weinberg  @xcite has derived a similar formula in a four - dimensional space by using a phenomenological theory and has also shown that the bulk viscosity alone could not explain the high entropy of the present microwave background radiation . for more details one",
    "is referred to weinberg  @xcite .",
    "given the sources of our universe it is possible to obtain the equations of motion for the gravitational field in the whole space - time .",
    "the starting point is of course , the einstein theory of gravitation .    as far as we are working in 2-d",
    "some fundamental problems appear .",
    "in fact , the main point is that the einstein action in 2-d furnishes no dynamics . in other words the usual left - hand side of einstein equations of motion that follows by using the hamilton variational principle @xmath69",
    "are in fact an _ identity _ in 2-d .",
    "this is related to the gauge invariances of gravitation in 2-d : space - time diffeomorphisms and ( local ) conformal transformations . with this in mind",

    "@xmath70\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "above we have not taken into account the term that refers to the cosmological constant . using the variational principle for the auxiliary field",
    "@xmath72 the equation of motion that follow is r ( x ) = -8t^_(x ) , together with the conservation law @xmath73 . equation ( [ rw21a ] ) relates the curvature scalar with the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the gravitational field equations are obtained from ( [ rw21a ] ) together with @xmath73 and by taking into account the constitutive equation for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the energy density .",
    "hence it follows that = -4(-p-),(+p+)+=0 . since @xmath76 ,",
    "the above system is closed if we can relate the pressure @xmath29 and the coefficient of bulk viscosity @xmath56 to the energy density @xmath77 . here",
    "we follow murphy  @xcite and assume a barotropic equation of state for the pressure and a linear relationship between the coefficient of bulk viscosity and the energy density , so that p=(-1),=. above @xmath78 is a constant and @xmath79 may range from @xmath80 .",
    "the value @xmath81 refers to a pure matter ( dust ) , @xmath82 to a pure radiation and @xmath83 to a `` false vacuum '' .",
    "if we introduce the hubble parameter @xmath84 the field equations ( [ e1 ] ) can be written thanks to ( [ e2 ] ) as h+h^2=4(-2-h ) , h(-h)+=0 .",
    "the elimination of the energy density of the two above equations leads to an equation for the hubble parameter that reads ( h+2hh)(-2-h)+h(h+h^2 ) + h(-2-h)(-h)(h+h^2)=0 .",
    "let us search for a solution of ( [ e4 ] ) by considering @xmath85constant . in this case",
    "we get that ( [ e4 ] ) reduces to @xmath86 and apart from the trivial solution @xmath87 we have two other solutions , namely : i ) @xmath88 and ii ) @xmath89 .",
    "only the first solution is physically possible since @xmath80 .",
    "we proceed to analyze the two energy conditions  @xcite , namely the weak energy condition which dictates that the energy density is a semi - positive quantity , i.e. , @xmath90 and the strong energy condition which imposes that the inequality @xmath91 must hold implying that @xmath92 .",
    "we are now ready to determine the solutions of the gravitational field equations .",
    "for that end we write the system of equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) as ( -1)=4p(-2-),(1- ) + pp=0 , ( -1)(h+h^2)=4p(-2-h ) , h(1- h)p+p=0 , respectively , where the cosmic scale factor , the hubble parameter , the pressure and the time are now taken as dimensionless quantities with respect to @xmath93 .",
    "> from the first system of equations ( [ e5 ] ) one may determine the cosmic scale factor @xmath2 and the pressure @xmath94 while from the second one ( [ e6 ] ) the hubble parameter @xmath95 can be obtained .",
    "we have chosen two values for @xmath79 , one of them @xmath96 correspond to a negative pressure ( `` false vacuum '' ) while the other @xmath97 implies a positive pressure .",
    "for the solutions of the two systems of equations ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) the following initial conditions were taken into account : in figures 2 through 5 it is shown the evolution with respect to the time of the cosmic scale factor , the hubble parameter , the pressure and the energy density which follow from the systems of equations ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) by taking into account the initial conditions ( [ e7 ] ) and the barotropic equation of state .    another important quantity which can be plotted versus the time is the entropy production rate . for the cases where @xmath98 the dimensionless expression for entropy production rate ( [ 12.82 ] ) can be written as = h^2(-1 ) . in order to obtain the above equation we have used the equation of state @xmath99 and the solution of the continuity equation ( [ 12.76 ] ) which reads @xmath100 . in figure 6",
    "we show the evolution of the entropy production rate with respect to the time .",
    "we proceed to discuss the results obtained in the last section .",
    "first we call attention to the fact that the period where this theory can be applied is the one where there exists an interaction between radiation and matter .",
    "the reason is that in the period of pure radiation the dynamic pressure vanishes while in the period of pure matter ( dust ) there is no interaction at all .",
    "furthermore the solutions are not valid for all values of the time , since in some period the radiation decouples from matter and we have no more the interaction between the radiation and matter which implies a vanishing dynamic pressure .    in figure 2 it is plotted the cosmic scale factor as function of the time .",
    "we have chosen that at the beginning of this period ( @xmath101 by adjusting clocks ) the cosmic scale factor is different from zero .",
    "we infer from this figure that the cosmic scale factor has a maximum at @xmath102 for @xmath97 and at @xmath103 for @xmath96 . from these points on the cosmic scale factor decreases and tends to zero , i.e. , it goes to a `` big crunch '' .",
    "it is noteworthy to call attention to the fact that the corresponding solution in the four - dimensional case  @xcite neither have this behavior for the cosmic scale factor nor admit a `` false vacuum '' solution . as was previously pointed out the difference between the solutions in the four- and two - dimensional cases is due to the fact that the relationship between the metric tensor and the sources in the 2-d case is modified because the einstein field equations give no dynamics for the 2-d case .",
    "the hubble parameter as a function of the time is shown in figure 3 .",
    "for both values of @xmath79 the hubble parameter decrease , attain a zero value for a time which correspond to the maximum of the cosmic scale factor and assume negatives values .    in figures 4 and 5 the evolution of the pressure and of the energy density are represented as functions of the time , respectively .",
    "both functions decrease with the time and attain their minimum values at the times where the cosmic scale factor has its maximum value .",
    "since in this theory there exists no mechanism that could increase the pressure and the energy density , we infer that the solutions for @xmath104 when @xmath97 and for @xmath105 when @xmath96 are not physically possible .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn out from figure 6 where the evolution of the entropy production rate is plotted as a function of the time . from this figure",
    "we note that the entropy production rate decreases with the time and attains its minimum ( @xmath106 ) when the cosmic scale factor reach its maximum value . at this point",
    "the entropy per particle @xmath33 attains its maximum value since @xmath107 .",
    "there exists no mechanism in this theory that could increase the entropy density rate from its minimum value with a corresponding decrease of the entropy per particle from its maximum value .",
