    "the usual way of organizing our thinking about physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is the effective field theory paradigm : all operators consistent with the symmetries are present in the theory , with higher - dimension operators suppressed by powers of the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "the sm itself provides an exception to this expectation : the yukawa couplings for all the fermions other than the top quark are much smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "this does not lead to any fine - tuning problems since small yukawa couplings are technically natural .",
    "nevertheless , we are normally led to suspect that the fermion mass hierarchy is controlled by ( weakly broken ) flavor symmetries operative at shorter distances .",
    "similar issues surround the question of proton decay in extensions submof the sm , especially when there is new physics at the tev scale . once again",
    ", some symmetry is normally invoked to forbid dangerous 1/(tev ) suppressed interactions mediating proton decay .",
    "furthermore , imposing global symmetries on low - energy effective theories , for instance , stabilizing the proton by declaring that the low - energy theory respects baryon number , is widely considered to be unsatisfactory given the lore that black - holes / wormholes violate all non - gauged symmetries .",
    "this seems particularly problematic for theories where the fundamental planck scale is lowered close to the tev scale @xcite , and suggests that some sort of continuous @xcite or discrete @xcite gauge symmetry is required to adequately suppress proton decay .    in this paper , we will show that all of this lore can easily and generically be violated in theories where the sm fields are constrained to live on a wall in @xmath1 extra dimensions , where gravity and perhaps other sm singlet fields are free to propagate .",
    "we will construct a simple model where our wall is slightly thick in one of the extra dimensions .",
    "the wall will have interesting sub - structure : while the higgs and sm gauge fields are free to propagate inside it , the sm fermion are  stuck \" at different points in the wall , with wave functions given by narrow gaussians as shown in figure 1 .",
    "= 5.0 in    without imposing any flavor symmetries on the short - distance theory , we will see that the long - distance 4-dimensional theory can naturally have exponentially small yukawa couplings , arising from the small overlap between left- and right - handed fermion wave functions .",
    "similarly , without imposing any symmetries to protect against proton decay , the proton decay rate can be exponentially suppressed to safety if the quarks and leptons are are localized at different ends of the wall .",
    "we emphasize that there is nothing fine - tuned about this from the point of view of the low - energy 4-dimensional theory ; all the exponentially small couplings are technically natural .",
    "however , our examples violate the usual intuition that small couplings in a low - energy theory must be explained by symmetries in the high - energy theory . instead",
    ", small couplings arise from the location and geometry of fermion fields stuck at different points in the extra dimensions , with no symmetries in the high - energy theory whatsoever .",
    "note that this mechanism of separating fermions in an extra dimension is already being used to preserve chiral symmetry on the lattice in kaplan s domain wall fermions @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations @xcite show that chiral symmetry is protected very effectively by separating the left and right handed components of the fermions in the 5th dimension",
    ".    if the wall thickness @xmath2 is close to the tev scale , which is natural in theories with very low fundamental planck scale , the mechanisms suggested in this paper can give rise to dramatic signals at future colliders .",
    "since the sm gauge fields can only propagate inside the wall , @xmath2 effectively acts as the size of the extra dimensions for them .",
    "therefore , at energies above @xmath3 ,  kaluza - klein \" excitations ( the higher harmonics of a particle in a box ) of the gauge fields can be produced , and can scan the wall substructure . in particular , while the lowest excitation of the gauge fields ( which we identify as the usual 4-d sm gauge fields ) have a flat wave function throughout the wall and couple with standard strength to all the sm fermions , the kk excitations couple with non - universal strength to the fermions stuck at different points in the wall . for instance , if some of the fermions are stuck at special points ( say the center of the wall ) , kk excitations of e.g. the photon can be baryophobic or leptophobic . more generally , measurements of the non - universal couplings of kk excitations to sm fermions can pin down their geometrical arrangement in the thick wall .",
    "we emphasize that our prediction of non - universal couplings of the sm fermions to gauge and higgs fields is model-_independent _ , it only depends on the fact that the fermions are stuck at different points in the extra dimensions .",
    "of course , the values of the different couplings are model-_dependent _ and can be used to distinguish between models .",
    "in section 2 we describe an explicit field theory mechanism which we use to construct a setup as outlined above ; we discuss how to localize a single chiral fermion to defects in higher dimensions and then generalize to several fermions localized at different points in the vicinity of the same defect . in section 3 we derive the exponentially small couplings which result from our framework and demonstrate how the scenario can explain the sm fermion mass hierarchy and suppress proton decay",
    ". we also comment on neutrino masses .",
    "section 4 contains a brief discussion of experimental signatures resulting from the non - universal couplings of kk gauge fields .",
    "for example , our kk fields make a contribution to atomic parity violation with the correct sign to explain the discrepancies between the sm prediction and the most recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "for simplicity we limit ourselves to constructions with one extra dimension .",
    "generalizations to higher dimensions are equally interesting and can be analyzed similarly .",
    "localizing fields in the extra dimension necessitates breaking of higher dimensional translation invariance .",
    "this is accomplished in our construction of a thick wall by a spatially varying expectation value for a five - dimensional scalar field @xmath4 as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we assume the expectation value to have the shape of a domain wall transverse to the extra dimension and centered at @xmath5 .",

    "the solutions x_5 ~expx_5 ~exp  , are exponentials with support near the zeros of @xmath4 . in the infinite system that we are considering these modes can not both be normalizable .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath38 is normalizable if @xmath39 and @xmath40 as in figure 2 , and if @xmath41 and @xmath42 then the mode @xmath43 is normalizable . in the other cases",

    "note that coupling @xmath10 to @xmath45 would have rendered @xmath44 normalizable and we would have instead localized a massless right handed chiral fermion .    for clarity ,",
    "let us write the full wave function of the massless chiral fermion in the chiral basis ( * x*,x_5 ) = (    c x_5 ( * x * ) + 0    )  .",
    "we can easily generalize eq .",
    "( [ single5 ] ) to the case of several fermion fields .",
    "we simply couple all 5-d dirac fields to the same scalar @xmath4    = ^5x _ i , j |_i[i_5 + ( x_5)-m]_ij _ j  . [ multi5 ] here we allowed for general yukawa couplings @xmath46 and also included masses @xmath47 for the fermion fields .",

    "we will set @xmath48 in this paper , then @xmath47 can be diagonalized with eigenvalues @xmath49 .",

    "again , the wave functions in the 5th coordinate are gaussian , but they are now centered around the zeros of @xmath51 . in the sho approximation",
    "this is at @xmath52 .",
    "thus , at energies well below @xmath53 the five - dimensional action above describes a set of non - interacting four dimensional chiral fermions localized at different 4-d `` slices '' in the 5th dimension .",
    "note that while the overall position of the massless fermions in the @xmath13-direction is a dynamical variable ( the location of the zero of @xmath4 ) , the relative positions of the various fermions are fixed by the @xmath49 . thus even when we turn on interactions between the massless fields , the relative distances which control the size of coupling constants in the effective 4-d theory stay fixed .",
    "we now exhibit the field content of the 5-d theory which can reproduce the chiral spectrum of the 4-d sm as localized zero modes .",
    "first note that by choosing all @xmath54 s positive we have localized only left handed chiral weyl spinors .",
    "that implies that we will construct the sm using only left handed spinors , the right handed fields are represented by their charge conjugates @xmath55 .",

    "we also briefly mention how we imagine confining gauge fields to a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional wall .",
    "a field - theoretic mechanism for localizing gauge fields was proposed by dvali and shifman and was later extended and applied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is to arrange for the gauge group to confine outside the wall ; the flux lines of any electric sources turned on inside the wall will then be repelled by the confining regions outside and forced to propagate only inside the wall .",
    "this traps a massless gauge field on the wall .",
    "since the gauge field is prevented to enter the confined region , the thickness @xmath2 of the wall acts effectively as the size of the extra dimensions in which the gauge fields can propagate .",
    "notice that in a picture like this , the gauge couplings will exhibit power law running above the scale @xmath3 , and so the scenario of @xcite for gauge coupling unification may be implemented , without the presence of any new dimensions beyond the large gravitational dimensions .",

    "proton decay places a very stringent constraint on most extensions of the standard model . unless a symmetry can be imposed to forbid either baryon or lepton number violation , proton decay forces the scale of new physics to be extremely high .",

    ".      there is an alternative way of understanding the @xmath74 suppression which is physically transparent and shows that all radiative corrections are also suppressed by the same exponential factor .",

    "= 4.0 in    note that this argument implies that grand unification at a scale as low as @xmath53 or @xmath69 does not lead to rapid proton decay , as long as there are no delocalized fermionic fields with masses below @xmath69 .",
    "we can not resist the temptation to speculate that the same vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) which break the gut symmetry near the scale @xmath69 may also be responsible for the separation of the sm fermions in the 5th dimension .",
    "for example the @xmath47 of eq . (",
    "[ multi5 ] ) could stem from the vev of a gut symmetry breaking field which points in the ( b - l ) direction .",

    "one might then wonder what happened to the general lore that black - hole / wormhole effects violate all non - gauged symmetries and are therefore dangerous . in evaluating this argument",
    ", we have to recall that it was planck - scale sized wormholes giving the supposedly @xmath68 symmetry violating effects . since these have a mass above the cutoff , all their effects can be encoded in terms of local operators suppressed by @xmath87 ; and indeed , we presumed that such  dangerous \" operators were really present in the theory .",
    "however , their effects are harmless because the quarks and leptons are stuck at different points , yet have to be dragged close to each other for the dangerous operators to be operative .",

    "the largest possible effect which might arise from wormholes would come from long and skinny wormholes which stretch from the proton to the lepton ; but even these are completely safe as their action is at least @xmath89 .",
    "separating quarks and leptons at different points in extra dimensions can easily suppress proton decay without imposing any symmetries on the high - energy theory . on the other hand , as already mentioned , operators violating baryon and lepton number need not be suppressed .",
    "in fact , in the absence of any symmetries in the high - energy theory , a majorana neutrino mass operator ~d^5 x turns into an unsuppressed majorana mass term for the 4-d zero mode ~d^4 * x * since there is no small overlap between @xmath58 s wave function with itself .",
    "there are a number of ways of resolving this problem ; we will just mention the obvious strategy of adding a right - handed neutrino and gauging @xmath90 .",
    "of course @xmath90 must be broken in such a way as to not allow large majorana masses after breaking . in our framework",
    "this would be most naturally achieved with a @xmath90 breaking vev which is localized within the wall but at some distance from the lepton field @xmath58 so that the majorana neutrino mass is exponentially suppressed .",
    "could also be broken everywhere within the wall if a discrete subgroup remains preserved , or it could be broken on a distant wall if @xmath90 is gauged in the large bulk where gravity propagates @xcite . for another approach to neutrino masses",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "in addition one would also get small dirac neutrino masses , with the tiny yukawa couplings originating from the overlap between right- and left- handed neutrino wave functions .",

    "recall that the at the edge of the wall , the fermion mass @xmath91 is @xmath92 , and must not be larger than the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath69 .",
    "in fact we will take them to be comparable .",
    "therefore , we have three scales in the problem : the uv cutoff @xmath69 , @xmath53 and the wall thickness scale @xmath3 , with magnitudes related roughly as m _ * ~10 ~100 l^-1 since we can not push @xmath3 significantly below @xmath93 tev , the fundamental scale @xmath69 is bounded below by @xmath94 tev .",
    "this is actually desirable from another point of view : in the absence of flavor symmetries , it is difficult to protect against flavor changing neutral currents without pushing the scale of higher - dimension operators to @xmath94 tev .",
    "notice that even though the theory becomes effectively 5-dimensional above @xmath3 , the theory is perturbative up to the uv cutoff @xmath69 . from the 4-dimensional viewpoint ,",
    "we have @xmath95 gauge and higgs field kk modes , and so the effective expansion parameter is n_kk ~o(1 ) where @xmath96 is a generic low - energy gauge coupling or top yukawa coupling . from the higher - dimensional point of view , the theory is on the edge of being strongly coupled at the uv cutoff @xmath69 .    finally , we wish to give a rough idea of the sort of suppressions which are generated by our @xmath97 size effects , with @xmath98 for yukawa couplings and @xmath99 for proton decay :    .1 in    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .1 in it is attractive that for @xmath100 just ranging between @xmath101 , we can get appropriate sizes for everything from the top yukawa coupling @xmath102 ( for @xmath103 ) , to the electron yukawa @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , to sufficient suppression for proton decay ( @xmath106 ) .",

    "( [ effc ] ) we find the effective couplings of the tower of 4-d kk gauge fields to the fermions .",
    "note that since @xmath114 has a flat wave function in the extra dimensions , it has the same coupling to both fermions as required by 4-dimensional gauge invariance .",
    "however the couplings of the fermions to the massive kk states , @xmath118 and @xmath83 , are proportional to cosines and sines from the wave functions of the kk states at the locations of the fermions .",
    "= 4.5 in    suppose that we are sitting on the @xmath119-channel resonance for particle - antiparticle annihilation mediated by the @xmath1th kk modes of @xmath118 and @xmath83 .",
    "then the relative cross section for @xmath120 ( and @xmath121 ) as calculated from the diagrams in figure 7 will be different from @xmath122 : ( 1^+ 1 ^ - a^(n ) , b^(n ) 1^+ 1 ^ - ) & & _",

    "for example , in the dvali - shifman mechanism , confinement outside the wall forces specific boundary conditions @xmath124 at the edges of the wall @xcite .",
    "this then enforces @xmath125 at @xmath126 , and the @xmath127 are eliminated .",
    "in addition , the @xmath128 may now be periodic or anti - periodic , thus @xmath129 .",
    "the position dependence of kk gauge couplings raises the interesting possibility that some of the kk excitations of various fields may be leptophobic or baryophobic if the quarks or leptons sit at nodes of their wave functions .",
    "more generally , the cross sections above are modified to ( 1^+ 1 ^ - a^(n ) 1^+ 1 ^ - ) & = & _ n  ^4(k_n s_1 ) + ( 2^+ 2 ^ - a^(n ) 2^+ 2 ^ - ) & = & _ n  ^4(k_n s_2 ) + ( 1^+ 1 ^ - a^(n ) 2^+ 2 ^ - ) & = & _ n  ^2 ( k_n s_1 )  ^2(k_n s_2 )    there are clearly other interesting possibilities arising from the non - universal couplings of sm fermions to the kk excitations . as one example , in our scenario for suppressing proton decay by separating quark and lepton wave functions , the non - standard coupling of the quarks and leptons to the kk modes has an interesting impact on atomic parity violation ( apv ) . the latest experimental results @xcite indicate that the measured weak charge of the nucleus is _ lower _ than the sm expectation by @xmath130 .",
    "if we had a conventional kaluza - klein tower at @xmath93 tev scale , with standard couplings to quarks and leptons , this would _ enhance _ the sm contribution to apv . in our case",
    ", however , the situation can be different . if we impose the @xmath131 boundary conditions as stated above , then the first kaluza - klein excitation has the profile shown in figure 8 .",
    "notice that the product of the quark and lepton couplings to the first kk excitation has the opposite sign as in the sm , and gives a contribution to atomic parity violation that moves in the right direction .",
    "the sign of this effect is an inevitable consequence of our mechanism for suppressing proton decay , and the correct magnitude can be obtained if the wall thickness is @xmath107 tev .",
    "in this paper we have shown that approximate symmetries can arise in a long - distance theory without any symmetry explanation in the underlying short - distance theory",
    ". instead , even if symmetries are maximally broken at short distances , exponentially small couplings between different fields can result if they are  stuck \" at slightly different points in extra dimensions .",
    "this opens a new arena for model - building , where a specific arrangement of the fermions in extra dimensions , and not familiar flavor symmetries , determine the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "furthermore , proton decay can be elegantly disposed of , even in theories with the fundamental cutoff close to the tev scale , if quarks and leptons are separated from each other by a factor of 10 larger than their size in the extra dimensions .",
    "if the effective size of this extra dimension or equivalently our wall thickness is close to the tev scale , these ideas can be probed at the lhc and nlc . the smoking gun for our mechanism for would be the detection non - universality in the coupling of sm fermions to the kk excitations of the sm gauge fields . a detailed analysis of this non - universality",
    "could then be used to  map \" the locations of the fermions in the extra dimensions . in closing",
    "we would like to emphasize that our mechanism of suppressing couplings from non - trivial wave functions is generically operative in higher dimensional theories with chiral fermions , as most such models obtain chiral matter from modes stuck to a defect in the higher dimensions .",
    "this defect may be a field theoretic domain wall in one extra dimension , a cosmic string in two extra dimensions , or a d - brane or orbifold fixed point suppression of yukawa couplings between twisted sector fields at different orbifold fixed points has been known for some time , see e.g. @xcite . ] in a string model .",
