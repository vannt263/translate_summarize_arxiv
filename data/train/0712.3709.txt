    "the deviation of light rays near the sun and the change in the orientation of mercury s orbit with each revolution were the first dramatic confirmations of the correctness of einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "surprisingly it is uneasy to find the detailed calculations of those phenomena in the specialized scientific literature .",
    "for example even the comprehensive reference book _ gravitation _ by misner _",
    "et al _ ( 1973 ) does not provide the reader with full explicit demonstrations of the effects .",
    "truly it would seem that there is no simple way to conduct the complete calculation since it is necessary to dive into the full theory of general relativity .",
    "fortunately , in their book about black holes and general relativity , taylor and wheeler ( 2000 ) have succeeded in deriving the needed equations of motion without appealing to tensor formalism . to determine the motion of a free object in curved geometry",
    ", they use what they call a `` principle of extremal aging '' along the path of the particle .",
    "that principle directly leads to the desired equations while using only simple algebra .    exploiting their astute technique and collecting together parts of their work we carry out a complete presentation of the legendary effects predicted by einstein when founding general relativity , namely the deviation of stellar light near the sun s mass and the advance of the perihelion of mercury .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to supply teachers , students and beginners in general relativity with a document both yielding in a single place a full account of those relativistic phenomena and still remaining simple and accessible in spite of the difficulty of the problem .",
    "in fact in a sole article we begin with the derivation of the equations of motion in the curved spacetime surrounding a massive object and we end with the numerical evaluation of the magnitude of the physical effects under consideration .",
    "the calculation is thus entirely self - contained .",
    "now , as far as we are aware , such a kind of document does not exist yet and thus deserves being published , even if it does not offer new material , as almost all the demonstrations shown here may be found in taylor and wheeler s book .",
    "we first closely follow taylor and wheeler s treatment in establishing the required formulae of motion in schwarzschild geometry .",
    "but we depart from their approach when calculating the advance of mercury s perihelion .",
    "carrying out a calculation adapted from wald ( 1984 ) , taylor and wheeler analyze the orbit of the planet by splitting its periodic motion into two components : an angular orbit and a radial oscillation .",
    "while the angular motion is described as nearly circular , the small inward and outward displacement is considered as a simple harmonic oscillator moving radially in a potential well . in this context",
    "it is found that the two corresponding periods differ by a tiny amount .",
    "as the oscillation takes place more slowly , it becomes late with respect to the period of revolution and this gives rise to the precession phenomenon .",
    "contrary to this strategy we prefer to proceed more directly by adopting the algebraic method used by weinberg ( 1972 ) in his book on general relativity .",
    "the corresponding procedure allows the orbit to be elliptical and does not require the development of additional concepts .",
    "actually , as they are written in polar coordinates , the equations of motion immediately yield the progression of the azimuthal angle @xmath0 as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath1 and thus make it possible to evaluate the change in this angle over one revolution .",
    "in particular the formulae show that from one passage at the perihelion to the next one the azimuthal angle @xmath0 increases by a little more than @xmath2 , which means that the perihelion does advance along the orbit .    additionally , taking advantage of the expressions at hand we rediscover kepler s third law relating the period of revolution of a planet to the length of its semi - major axis .",
    "we finally write the formulae determining the trajectory of a photon around a massive body and compute the change in the direction of a starlight pulse passing near the sun .",
    "the integration of the equations readily shows that the azimuthal angle of the photon increases by more than @xmath3 along its path ( @xmath3 corresponding to a straight line in the absence of mass ) , the additional quantity representing the relativistic deflection .",
    "incidentally , as the paper is intended to be fully accessible to students and ( again ) self - contained , some elementary notions of physics , especially in relativity , are recalled here and there . as a result",
    "no prerequisite in relativity is needed to study this article .",
    "the orbit of mercury , the closest planet to the sun , was known as early as 1859 to change with time in a partly unexplained way .",
    "it was observed that the perihelion ( the orbital point closest to the sun ) moves a little around the sun , advancing at a tiny rate with each orbit .",
    "but whereas newtonian mechanics was able to account for the major part of this change , a residual of 43 seconds of arc per century remained unexplained .",
    "it is this residual that was correctly predicted by einstein s theory .",
    "likewise arthur eddington s verification of the deflection of starlight near the sun in the total solar eclipse of 29th may , 1919 , gave albert einstein an immediate notoriety .",
    "now while the qualitative aspect and the historical impact of both the precession of mercury s perihelion and the deviation of light rays near the sun are widely ( and legitimately ) described in the scientific literature as proofs of the rightness of general relativity , the detailed calculations of the magnitude of those tiny relativistic effects are rarely given .",
    "the present paper is consecrated to this `` numerical exercise '' .",
    "general relativity teaches us that mass particles or photons propagating freely through space follow what is called a `` geodesic '' of spacetime .",
    "thus we have to examine the following points :    * what is a `` geodesic '' ? * which equations govern a geodesic ? * find the solutions of those equations for a mass particle and determine the orbit of a planet ( which is actually an ellipse in a first approximation : thank you newton ! ) ; * compute the tiny angle of rotation of the ellipse after the completion of one orbit ; * by letting the mass of the particle tend towards zero , find the trajectory of light near the sun ; * compute the angle between the initial and final directions of a light ray grazing the solar disk .",
    "newtonian mechanics describes the motion of a particle in an absolute space with respect to an absolute time .",
    "the position of the moving object is located by its coordinates with respect to some frame of reference and is given as a function of time @xmath4 .",
    "special relativity affirms that there exists no absolute time and that time can not be dissociated from space .",
    "the theory bases its reasoning on _ events _ , each event being characterized by a point m ( where it happens ! ) and a time @xmath4 ( when it happens ! ) .",
    "the events attached to a moving particle constitute what is called a _",
    "worldline_.    let us consider for example a spaceship moving freely through space , which means that all its motors are turned off .",
    "let us imagine that regular flashes are emitted in accordance with a clock located inside the rocket and ticking at a constant rhythm .",
    "the time interval between two successive flashes will be denoted by @xmath5 ( this quantity is thus measured with respect to the proper time of the spaceship ) .",
    "think now of another frame of reference as constituted by an ensemble of space beacons , also free from acceleration , at constant mutual distances from one another ( each free beacon stays at the same distance from its neighbours ) .",
    "every signal bears the indication of its position in space ( for instance by showing its distance from some point of origin ) and holds its own clock .",
    "the clocks of this second frame are synchronized between them .",
    "then in that latter frame the interval between two flashes ( i.e. two events ) is characterized by two numbers : the space interval @xmath1 and the time interval @xmath4 . to determine those two quantities it suffices to record which beacon faces flash  # 1 and",
    "which beacon faces flash  # 2 while noting the times of those events as shown by the clocks attached to the beacons .",
    "special relativity is based on the following principle .",
    "the proper time interval @xmath5 between event  # 1 and event  # 2 is given by the formula @xmath6 and this quantity does not depend on the frame in which it is evaluated .",
    "in other words all observers agree on the value of @xmath5 computed by formula  ( 1 ) , although the values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 differ from one system of reference to another .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , distances will be measured in units of time , as is often done in astronomy .",
    "we have chosen to do so in writing ( 1 ) .",
    "if however distances @xmath1 are expressed in conventional units , for instance in centimetres , then one should pass from the latter to our distance @xmath1 expressed in seconds via the formula @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the speed of light in conventional units , namely @xmath9  cm / s .",
    "( expressing distances and times with the same unit would amount to taking the speed of light equal to unity . )",
    "in general relativity the property of invariance of the proper interval with respect to a change of the coordinates remains valid but only locally , i.e. under the condition of staying in a sufficiently small region of spacetime ( its size depends on the accuracy of the measurements ) .",
    "the new feature concerns the expression of the proper time previously given by ( 1 ) .",
    "the coefficients entering this formula depend now on the point of spacetime under consideration and the resulting expression takes the name of _",
    "metrics_. in fact , and this is wonderful , the whole structure of spacetime , and especially its curvature , is included in the local expression of @xmath5 and in the form of its coefficients .",
    "we are interested here in the structure of spacetime around the sun . in order to describe the physics",
    "locally we consider two nearby events separated by infinitesimal amounts of time and space coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ". if space were flat , the metrics would have the form @xmath14 which is usually written ( and a little sloppily ) by convention as @xmath15 by working in spherical coordinates , in a plane containing the center of the sun ( this choice removes one spatial coordinate ) , that formula becomes @xmath16 where @xmath1 denotes the distance to the center and @xmath0 an azimuthal angle in the plane of the orbit .",
    "but spacetime around a center of attraction of mass @xmath17 ( for instance a black hole or the vicinity of the sun ) is not flat .",
    "it is characterized by the _",
    "schwarzschild metric _",
    "( see for instance misner _",
    "et al _ , 1973 ) @xmath18    the story is really fantastic : the _ whole _ structure of spacetime is embodied in this `` simple '' formula ( 3 ) .",
    "even the famous black hole lurks behind those apparently innocuous symbols .",
    "one question : in which units is the mass @xmath17 expressed in that formula ?",
    "it is seen that @xmath17 has the dimension of a length , a quantity that we measure here in seconds .",
    "therefore @xmath17 will also be measured in seconds .",
    "the formula allowing to transform grams in seconds is @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "thus the mass of the sun is @xmath21  g or @xmath22  s or 1.5  km .",
    "the metric , that is the formula expressing at a given point of spacetime the temporal interval between two nearby events , reveals the presence of curvature as soon as the expression deviates from formula  ( 2 ) that corresponds to flat euclidian space .",
    "this metric will allow us to find the properties of the motion of a test particle free from acceleration .",
    "actually both special and general relativity teach us that between two given events @xmath23 and @xmath24 a freely moving body follows the path for which the time interval @xmath5 is the maximum . by defining a geodesic as the path maximising the time interval",
    ", it can also be stated that a freely moving particle follows a geodesic of spacetime .    _",

    "it will also yield the expressions of the energy and angular momentum of a particle in orbit around the centre of attraction .",
    "let us apply the principle of maximisation of the proper time interval in the following manner .",
    "suppose that a free spatial ship ( whose rockets are turned off ) falls radially , therefore along a straight path , towards the central attractive mass .",
    "imagine that three successive flashes , with nearby time and space coordinates , are emitted inside the spaceship .",
    "we observe those three events in some external frame . in that latter frame",
    "the event @xmath23 consists in the emission of a flash at time @xmath25 when the spatial engine is located at radius @xmath26 .",
    "the flash @xmath24 is emitted at time @xmath4 when the cabin is at radius @xmath27 .",
    "the flash @xmath28 is emitted at time @xmath29 when the cabin is at radius @xmath30 .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is assumed to be small .",
    "we then imagine that we vary the intermediate coordinates of @xmath24 .",
    "the principle of maximal aging says that the geodesic starting from @xmath23 and ending at @xmath28 will pass through event @xmath24 such that the proper time interval @xmath31 is maximum .",
    "here @xmath32 measures the interval over the first spacetime segment @xmath33 , which connects @xmath23 to @xmath24 and @xmath34 measures the time interval over the second segment @xmath35 , which connects @xmath24 to @xmath28 .    in order to avoid varying all quantities at the same time , we assume in this experiment that the locations of the radii @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath30 are fixed and that only the time @xmath4 , at which the second flash is emitted , is allowed to change . according to ( 3 ) the interval of proper time over the first segment @xmath33 is given by its square @xmath36 from which we deduce @xmath37    the lapse of time over segment @xmath35 between the events @xmath24 and @xmath28 is @xmath38 , and therefore the proper time duration @xmath34 is given by @xmath39 from which we deduce @xmath40    to make the total time interval @xmath41 maximum with respect to a variation @xmath10 of the time @xmath4 , we write @xmath42 deducing @xmath43 and @xmath44 from ( 6 ) and ( 8) and letting quite naturally @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we easily get @xmath47 the left side of that equation depends only on parameters characterizing the first segment a ( which connects @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) .",
    "the right side depends only on parameters related to the second segment b ( which connects @xmath24 to @xmath28 ) .",
    "we have discovered in equation  ( 10 ) a quantity that is the same for both segment .",
    "this quantity is thus a constant of the motion for the free particle under consideration . for good physical reasons ( especially to recover the formulae of special relativity ) ,",
    "one is led to identify that constant of motion as the ratio of the energy of the particle to its mass .",
    "we write this very important result under the form @xmath48 an expression in which we have returned to the differential notation for the intervals @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "incidentally we may notice that with the units we have chosen , energy @xmath49 and mass @xmath17 are expressed in the same unit ( for instance the second or the centimetre ) .",
    "we have applied the principle of maximising the proper time interval by varying the time of the intermediate event @xmath24 .",
    "we now perform the same operation but this time we vary the angle @xmath0 of that intermediate event .",
    "we recall that @xmath0 measures the direction of the moving particle with respect to a direction chosen as the origin .",
    "we call it the _ azimuth_.    we again consider the three events consisting in the emission of flashes inside a spaceship floating freely in space . the first segment @xmath33 connects event  @xmath23 to event  @xmath24 . the second segment @xmath35 connects @xmath24 to @xmath28 .",

    "the angle of the last one is fixed at @xmath51 .",
    "the intermediate azimuth is taken as the variable @xmath0 .",
    "again in order not to vary everything at the same time , we assume that the radius @xmath1 at which the second flash is emitted stays constant .",
    "we follow the same chain of reasoning as in the previous section . from the metric",

    "the left side , which contains only terms that are specific to the first segment , is equal to the right side , which contains only terms relative to the second segment .",
    "we thus exhibit another constant of motion , namely @xmath59 ( by shifting back to the differential notation ) , a quantity that turns out to be identified with the ratio of the angular momentum @xmath60 of the particle to its mass @xmath61 , which we write as @xmath62",

    "actually if @xmath108 , expression  ( 31 ) yields the equation of the trajectory in polar coordinates @xmath109 in the form @xmath110 which does correspond to an ellipse .",
    "ordinarily the equation is written as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the ellipse parameter ( sometimes called the _ semi - latus rectum _ ) and @xmath113 its eccentricity .    identifying ( 34 ) and ( 35 )",
    "we see that @xmath114 and @xmath115 with common notations the major axis of the ellipse is @xmath116 and the following relation holds @xmath117",
    "the second term in integral ( 33 ) , namely @xmath118 , reveals that the angle @xmath0 will increase more than twice @xmath3 when the planet returns to its perihelion , from which it started .",
    "this phenomenon precisely represents the precession of the orbit .",
    "in fact we multiply by 2 the increase in the angle @xmath0 between the perihelion @xmath71 ( corresponding to @xmath119 ) and the aphelion @xmath72 ( corresponding to @xmath120 to obtain a shift per period equal to @xmath121 where @xmath112 is defined in ( 36 ) . in conventional units we have",
    "@xmath122        the third sinusoidal term in @xmath123 in integral ( 33 ) adds only a periodical perturbation which produces a kind of noise .",
    "let us calculate the numerical value of the angle of precession .",
    "the semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit of mercure is @xmath124 and its eccentricity is @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath126 .",
    "the mass of the sun in centimetres is @xmath127 , which yields ( with @xmath128  g ) @xmath129  cm . thus @xmath130    knowing that there are 415 revolutions per century we conclude that the advance of the perihelion amounts to @xmath131",
    "let us profit from those formulae as a chance to calculate the period of revolution @xmath29 of a planet around the sun and recover the newtonian result .",
    "formula  ( 17 ) teaches us that the increment @xmath132 is proportional to the time increment @xmath63 .",
    "but that quantity is nothing else than the elementary area @xmath133 swept out by the radius joining the sun to the planet .",
    "therefore the total area swept out at time @xmath5 since time @xmath134 is @xmath135 after one complete revolution the total time elapsed is @xmath29 and the total swept out area equals the area of the ellipse , namely @xmath136 if @xmath137 and @xmath138 denote the semiaxes .",
    "thus @xmath139 or @xmath140 taking into account ( 25 ) which gives ( ignoring the @xmath17 term inside the parentheses ) @xmath141 and known relations @xmath142 we find @xmath143 in conventional units the formula reads @xmath144 an expression in which the velocity of light does not appear .",
    "this is third kepler s law .",
    "the preceding treatment is apparently not relevant to the case of a photon .",
    "in fact the calculation of the trajectory was done by incrementing the proper time but this latter concept has no meaning for a photon since the interval between two events that are located on the wordline of a photon is always equal to zero ( since at light velocity @xmath145 , the interval @xmath146 vanishes ) .",
    "nevertheless it can be shown rigorously ( see for instance taylor and wheeler , 2000 ) that by letting the mass of the particle tend towards zero , one arrives at the right results .",
    "thus for @xmath147 our equation ( 21 ) takes the form @xmath148 that equation will allow us to determine the deviation of light rays passing near the sun .",
    "it is necessary to specify the parameters found in the formulae .",
    "first the angular momentum of the moving particle at infinity is equal by definition to the product of its linear momentum @xmath112 by what is called the _ impact parameter _",
    "@xmath138 , which represents the distance between the center of attraction ( the sun in the present case ) and the initial direction of the velocity of the particle ( see the figure ) .    .",
    "the moving particle approaches the mass @xmath17 from a great distance with vector momentum @xmath149 . a test particle with a parallel velocity plunges radially onto the mass @xmath17 .",
    "the distance @xmath138 between their initially parallel paths at `` infinity '' is the impact parameter @xmath138 . ]    in other words @xmath150 in addition it is known that the momentum @xmath112 of a photon is equal to its energy @xmath49 ( with the units that were chosen ) .",
    "it results at once from this formula that @xmath151 if the ratio @xmath152 is equal to the impact parameter @xmath138 , ( 44 ) writes as @xmath153",
    "formula ( 47 ) will allow us to determine the change in the direction of a light pulse caused by the gravitational field of the sun . to achieve this aim we have to sum up the successive infinitesimal increments @xmath65 of the azimuthal angle @xmath0 along the path .",
    "this means that we have to carry out the integration of @xmath154 when @xmath1 varies from the minimum distance denoted @xmath155 ( @xmath155 is the radius of the sun if the light ray grazes its surface ) to infinity .",
    "we should still multiply that quantity by 2 to account for both symmetrical `` legs '' of the trajectory ( the photon first approaches the sun then recedes from it ) .",
    "it is necessary to stipulate a further point , namely the relation existing between the two quantities @xmath138 and @xmath155 that we have introduced , and that are not independent .",
    "the point @xmath156 corresponds to the place where the light photon is closest to the sun .",
    "there the photon moves tangentially .",
    "since at that point there is no radial component , we can write that the derivative @xmath157 vanishes .",

    "this is quite rewarding .",
    "the small value of the term @xmath171 will allow us to make an approximation and this operation will make us able to complete the integration . in conventional units the mass of the sun is @xmath21  grams and its radius is @xmath172  centimetres . by using the factor @xmath173  cm / g which makes it possible to transform grams into centimetres , we get the dimensionless quantity @xmath174    in ( 53 ) we can thus use the classical approximation @xmath175 to arrive at @xmath176 d\\alpha \\,.\\ ] ] therefore the total variation of the azimuth @xmath0 along the path of the photon is @xmath177 d\\alpha \\\\ & = & 2 \\left [ \\alpha + \\frac{m}{r}\\left(\\sin\\alpha + \\tan\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right ) \\right]_0^{\\pi/2}\\\\ & = & \\pi + 4m / r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     would vary from 0 to @xmath3 . in the presence of a mass the angle changes by an additional amount @xmath178 . ]    the first term @xmath3 gives the total change in the azimuthal angle of the photon where there is no sun present , since in that case the photon follows a straight path .",
    "it is the second term that gives the additional angle of deflection @xmath178 with respect to this straight line @xmath179    numerically at the surface of the sun ( with the values of the mass and the radius given above ) one finds @xmath180  radian , or ( knowing that @xmath3 radians equal 180 degrees and that there are 60 minutes of arc in one degree and 60 seconds of arc in one minute of arc ) @xmath181",
    "the deflection of light rays by the sun and the advance of the perihelion of mercury were among the first observational confirmations of general relativity and are thus of major historical value .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of their importance , it is difficult for students or non - specialists to access to the full calculations of those effects as they are not readily found in the textbooks or in the scientific literature dedicated to einstein s theory of gravitation . using a method devised by taylor and wheeler ( 2000 ) and repeating sections of their book",
