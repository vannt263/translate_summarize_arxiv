    "gravitation is one of the four interactions in the standard model of fundamental physics .",
    "general relativity , its current theoretical formulation , is in good agreement with most experimental tests of gravitation @xcite .",
    "but general relativity is a classical theory and all attempts to merge it with the quantum description of the other fundamental interactions suggest that it is not the final theory for gravitation .",
    "general relativity is also challenged by observations at galactic and cosmic scales .",
    "the rotation curves of galaxies and the relation between redshifts and luminosities of supernovae deviate from the predictions of general relativity .",
    "these anomalies are interpreted as revealing the presence of new components in the content of the universe , the so - called `` dark matter '' and `` dark energy '' which are thought to constitute respectively 25% and 70% of the energy content of the universe @xcite .",
    "their nature remains unknown and , despite their prevalence , they have not yet been detected by any other means than gravitational measurements .",
    "given the immense challenge posed by these large scale behaviors , it is necessary to explore every possible explanation including the hypothesis that general relativity is not a correct description of gravitation at galactic and cosmic scales @xcite .",
    "testing gravitation at the largest scales reachable by man - made instruments is therefore essential to bridge the gap between experiments in the solar system and astrophysical or cosmological observations .",
    "the most notable experiment was the test of the gravitation law performed by nasa during the extension of the pioneer 10 & 11 missions .",
    "this test resulted in what is now known as the `` pioneer anomaly '' @xcite , one of the few experimental signals deviating from the predictions of general relativity @xcite .    in a context dominated by the questions of dark matter and dark energy",
    ", the challenge raised by the anomalous pioneer signals has to be faced .",
    "efforts have been devoted to the reanalysis of pioneer data @xcite with the aim of learning as much as possible on its possible origin , which can be an experimental artifact as well as a hint of considerable importance for fundamental physics @xcite . in the meantime",
    ", theoretical studies have been devoted to determine whether or not the anomalous signal could reveal a scale - dependent modification of gravitation law while remaining compatible with other tests . among the candidates are in particular metric extensions",
    "@xcite as well as multifield extensions @xcite of general relativity .    naturally , several mission concepts have been proposed @xcite to improve the experiment performed by pioneer 10 & 11 probes .",
    "a key idea in most of these proposals is to embark accelerometers so as to measure the non - gravitational forces acting on the spacecraft , whatever may be the cause of these forces .",
    "the addition of this observable not only improves the accuracy and quality of the navigation of the spacecraft but also allows understanding the origin of the pioneer anomalous signals by measuring the non - gravitational acceleration of the spacecraft .",
    "indeed , with such an instrument , no models are needed to estimate non - gravitational forces , which removes a source of uncertainty in the orbit determination process .",
    "the main subsystem of the instrument is an electrostatic accelerometer called microstar , which inherits mature technologies .",
    "the main evolution of the instrument is to mount microstar on a rotating stage , called bias rejection system , which modulates the signal of interest , and thus makes it possible to remove the measurement bias of the electrostatic accelerometer . after a presentation of the motivations for this study",
    ", the accelerometer and the measurement principle will be described .",
    "the performance of the instrument will then be discussed .",
    "finally , the integration constraints , which depend on the spacecraft design , will be briefly presented . a precision of 1 pm s@xmath0 for the acceleration measured with an integration time of five hours will be demonstrated . using these measurements along with radio tracking data ,",
    "the instrument enables to enhance by at least three orders of magnitude the accuracy of the comparison between the spacecraft gravitational acceleration and theoretical predictions .",
    "the instrument studied in this article is an important technological upgrade for the future of fundamental physics in space as well as for the exploration of the outer solar system .",
    "it may indeed be flown as a passenger on planetary missions heading toward outer planets .",
    "it will improve the science return with respect to objectives in fundamental physics ",
    "deep space gravitation tests  as well as in solar system physics",
    " study of the gravity field and environment of the outer planets or their moons @xcite .",
    "this idea has been included in the roadmap for fundamental physics in space issued by esa in 2010 @xcite .",
    "indeed , these two scientific goals are intimately connected since the gravitation force law is related to the ephemeris of planets , moons and minor objects @xcite as well as to the origins of the solar system @xcite .",
    "the trajectory of a spacecraft , which is tracked by the radio link ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is the result of gravitational and non - gravitational forces .",
    "the knowledge of the non - gravitational forces makes it possible to compute the geodesic motion of the spacecraft from the radio tracking data .",
    "this geodesic motion can then be compared to predictions of gravitation theories , allowing to test gravitation at the solar system scale .",
    "the following analysis is made in a post - newtonian framework which is sufficient for the purpose of this article .",
    "the tracking techniques give access to the doppler acceleration of the spacecraft along the line of sight , @xmath1 .",
    "this doppler acceleration includes the non - gravitational acceleration , @xmath2 , and a term called @xmath3 .",
    "this last term includes the acceleration of the spacecraft due to the curvature of space - time , the interaction of the radio waves with the gravitational field , the speed and acceleration of the earth station tracking the spacecraft , and aberration effects .",
    "calling @xmath4 the unit vector directing the line of sight , this leads to the simplified formula : @xmath5 when @xmath1 is the only observable , it is necessary to use models to correct for @xmath2 in order to access @xmath3 , which can be compared to theoretical predictions .",
    "this approach has been implemented for all interplanetary spacecrafts orbit determinations so far @xcite .",
    "but the orbit determination is then subject to errors due to uncertainties or inaccuracies in the models .",
    "even when the average non - gravitational acceleration is properly corrected , temporal fluctuations are poorly known .      the electrostatic accelerometer with bias rejection gap measures along two orthogonal axis ( directed by @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) the absolute value of the non - gravitational acceleration acting on the spacecraft @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath4 is in the plane generated by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , one can retrieve the quantity @xmath3 by combining the doppler and the accelerometer measurements .",
    "this provides an additional observable which enhances the orbit reconstruction for several reasons .",
    "first , it removes parameters to be fitted in the process and consequently improves the quality of the orbit determination .",
    "second , it measures the fluctuations of the non - gravitational acceleration , which can not be taken into account by models .",
    "third , it removes the correlations which appear in the orbit determination process between the non - gravitational acceleration and the gravitational acceleration , when the former are not measured .",
    "this approach has been used for champ and grace geodesy missions @xcite . in the frame of a test of the gravitation law in the solar system ,",
    "the presence of an accelerometer becomes essential in order to achieve the best possible accuracy on the orbit determination .",
    "the instrument presented in this article has been designed for fundamental physics purposes , but it can also be used for orbit reconstruction around planets or during fly - bys @xcite . in terms of planetary scientific objectives ,",
    "the measurement of the non gravitational acceleration would improve the reconstruction of the gravity fields and therefore the knowledge of the body interior structure .",
    "it would also give information on the atmosphere with spatial and temporal resolutions outreaching by far those provided without accelerometric measurement .",
    "in this section , different sources of non - gravitational accelerations are discussed for an interplanetary spacecraft .",
    "depending on the power requirement on - board and on the target distance from the sun ( among other considerations ) , the power generation can be made using solar panels or radio - isotope thermal generator ( rtg ) . in the first case ,",
    "the predominant effect is the direct solar radiation pressure whereas , in the second one , it is the thermal radiation .",
    "the direct solar radiation pressure corresponds to the action of solar photons on a unit surface .",
    "the power carried by solar photons by surface unit at one astronomical unit from the sun , called @xmath8 , is approximately equal to @xmath9 w m@xmath0 @xcite . considering a ballistic coefficient equals to @xmath10 m@xmath11 kg@xmath12 , which is the order of magnitude for laplace mission @xcite , the acceleration due to radiation pressure is equal to @xmath13 m s@xmath0 at one astronomical unit , where @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "when the spacecraft is at a distance @xmath15 from the sun , this value is multiplied by the @xmath16 .",
    "the fluctuations of this acceleration have been characterized by @xcite for frequencies between @xmath17 hz and @xmath18 hz .",
    "the anisotropic thermal radiation of the spacecraft induces a force which is difficult to analyze and predict .",
    "one of the reasons is the time variation of the thermo - optics coefficients of the materials on the spacecraft and the difficulty to forecast them , as illustrated in the analysis by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the use of an instrument like gap removes any problem concerning the modeling of these forces since they are directly measured .    when a spacecraft orbits or fly - bys a planet , the atmosphere induces a force on the spacecraft which depends on the relative speed , the density and the ballistic coefficient .",
    "models of atmospheric density exist but their accuracy has not been proved and they do not take into account any time variability .",
    "therefore , computation of drag forces is plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "the interplanetary medium also induces a drag force on the spacecraft during its cruise .",
    "this effect has been evaluated for the pioneer probes and found to be small @xcite .",
    "finally the magnetic field acts on the spacecraft because of its charge via the lorentz force .",
    "when close to a planet , the spacecraft will also experience the radiation pressure due to the planet s albedo .",
    "other forces which are not listed here may also play a role ( e.g. solar wind , maneuver , gas leakage ) .",
    "the electrostatic accelerometer , microstar , measures a combination of the non - gravitational accelerations presented above and other terms described later in this article .",
    "along one axis , this external signal , which is to be measured , is called @xmath19 and the actual measurement made by microstar is called @xmath20 .",
    "the measurement chain induces a noise and a bias , respectively called @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as well as linear and quadratic factors , respectively called @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the bias corresponds to the low - frequency fluctuations and drifts with respect to the duration of the measurement .",
    "the relation between these quantities is given by : @xmath25 in the following , @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be assumed to be equal to zero without jeopardizing the discussion .",
    "the purpose of the instrument presented in this article is to remove the bias via a modulation of the external signal using a rotation of microstar with a rotating stage called bias rejection system .",
    "first , the electrostatic accelerometer microstar is presented , as well as the spectral characterization of its noise .",
    "then , the measurement principle and the bias rejection scheme are described .",
    "this gives the opportunity to give some requirements on the bias rejection system needed to achieve the target accuracy .",
    "microstar is an electrostatic accelerometer @xcite based on onera s expertise in the field of accelerometry and gravimetry : champ , grace and goce missions @xcite and the upcoming microscope mission @xcite .",
    "ready - to - fly technology is used with original developments aimed at reducing power consumption , size and weight .",
    "the accelerometer is mounted on a rotating stage , called bias rejection system , which allows removing the bias and therefore making absolute measurements .",
    "an interface and control unit ( icu ) is in charge of interfacing the instrument with the spacecraft .",
    "the principle of microstar is to detect by capacitive measurement any motion of the proof mass with respect to the cage and to act , via a feedback control loop , on the proof mass thanks to electrostatic forces in order to keep it at the center of the cage .",
    "so the proof mass is almost motionless with respect to the cage in the control bandwidth of the control loop and at the level of the capacitive measurement noise .",
    "the proof mass is inside a cage composed of six identical plates .",
    "this choice has been made to decrease the cost and production time of microstar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : microstar_core ] ) .",
    "all these components are made in the same ultra - low expansion ( ule ) silica glass manufactured by corning .",
    "the proof mass is a cube whose edge measures 2 cm and which weights 18 g. it is gold coated with a cutting such that two opposite faces have opposite polarisation . on each ule plates ,",
    "two electrodes are engraved by ultra - sonic machining , which is patented by onera @xcite .",
    "the position and attitude of the proof mass with respect to the cage ( 6 degrees of freedom ) are controlled by the six pairs of electrodes , such that there is no contact between the proof mass and the cage .",
    "the electrodes are designed such that degrees of freedom are coupled two by two . and",
    "the design of the accelerometer is completely symmetric .",
    "consequently , the accelerometer can not be levitated under 1 g : the condition and performance of the instrument will have to be tested in a drop tower @xcite , as it is foreseen for microscope accelerometers @xcite .",
    "the core of microstar is mounted on an hermetic sole - plate , and an hermetic housing ensures vacuum and cleanliness .",
    "a getter maintains a vacuum smaller than @xmath26 pa during the whole life of the instrument .",
    "the proximity electronics is mounted on a printed card board ( pcb ) around the hermetic housing .",
    "the mass estimate for the accelerometer shown in figure [ fig : microstar_housing ] is @xmath27 kg . the bias rejection system which will be added to microstar shall not exceed 1.1 kg and the interface and control unit 1.0 kg .",
    "the total mass required to host the instrument on board a spacecraft will therefore be 3.1 kg .",

    "the total force acting along one direction is the sum of the forces of the two pairs of electrodes perpendicular to this direction ; and the torque acting along one direction is proportional to the difference of the forces of the two pairs of electrodes .",
    "note that , contrary to an harmonic oscillator , this force tends to bring the proof mass out of equilibrium because of the positive sign before @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , a control loop is required to maintain the proof mass at the center of the cage . when @xmath33 , the force acting on the proof mass is proportional to the potential of the electrodes @xmath35 . therefore , the output of the accelerometer is the quantity @xmath42 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath43 depends on the value of @xmath34 . to keep it perfectly constant , the proof mass",
    "is linked to a reference voltage source via two gold wires , such that two opposite faces of the proof mass have an opposite potential , as in figure [ fig : force ] .",
    "this set up is different from previous accelerometers designed at onera for which the potential on the proof mass was uniformly equal to @xmath34 and the potentials on the electrodes were @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this choice has been made for microstar for miniaturization purpose as this new set up allows reducing the mass of the electronics .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the electronics is composed of capacitive detectors ( one for each couple of electrodes ) , a pid ( proportional - integral - derivative ) control and a recombination device . as described above , the outputs of the accelerometer are the voltage applied on each of the electrodes to control the proof mass .",
    "these voltages are digitalized through an accurate analog to digital converter of 24 bits and sent to the interface and control unit .",
    "the same electrodes are used for detection and action . in order to separate these two functions ,",

    "i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath59 are identical  and the satellite is perfectly rigid ",
    "i.e. the distance between @xmath54 and @xmath55 remains constant .",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath38 are respectively the masses of the satellite and of the proof mass .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are equal to : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79    in the next section , the two terms @xmath74 and @xmath75 will not be taken into account because they are either negligible or known with sufficient accuracy to be removed .",
    "this hypothesis will be discussed in section [ section : accommodation ] . moreover , to simplify the discussion , it will be assumed that @xmath80 , i.e. the spacecraft is not rotating with respect to the reference frame of the solar system .",
    "let s introduce @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the components of @xmath84 in @xmath59 ; @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the components of @xmath88 in @xmath59 ; and @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the components of @xmath92 in @xmath93 .",
    "the electronics of the instruments gives the values of the components of @xmath84 in @xmath59 .",
    "however , there are defaults in the measurement chain ( cf . equation ( [ eq : bias_noise ] ) with @xmath94 ) and this translates in particular in a bias called `` electronic bias '' .",
    "if @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the outputs of microstar for each axis , the following relations hold @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the electronic bias and @xmath100 is the measurement noise . moreover , equation ( [ eq : dynamics_final ] ) yields @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath62 is the angle controlled by the bias rejection system . considering",
    "only the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis , the previous equations lead to @xmath103 where @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) are the total measurement bias .",
    "the non - gravitational acceleration acting on the spacecraft is modulated by the angle @xmath62 whereas the bias of microstar is not .",
    "it is therefore possible to separate the bias @xmath106 and @xmath107 from the true acceleration acting on the spacecraft , using the bias rejection system .",
    "one possible way to use these two equations is to perform a spectral separation of the acceleration and of the bias .",
    "assuming for example that @xmath108 , with @xmath109 a constant angular speed , @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be multiplied by @xmath110 , after being received on ground .",
    "for the @xmath111 axis , this would lead to the demodulated quantity @xmath112 the external acceleration which was modulated at the frequency @xmath113 in @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( cf .",
    "equations ( [ eq : mx ] ) and ( [ eq : my ] ) ) is brought back in the continuous by the demodulation .",
    "the bias @xmath114 is supposed to vary such that the fourier transform of the term @xmath115 is null at low frequencies . by applying a low - pass filter to @xmath116 and @xmath117 ,",
    "one recovers an unbiased measurement of @xmath89 and @xmath90 plus the low frequencies of the modulated noise @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the noise is also filtered such that only the components around the modulated frequency affect the final measurements .",
    "this heterodyne method is the simplest way of achieving the recovery of the non - gravitational acceleration .",
    "it has however the disadvantage of requiring the rotating stage to operate continuously .",
    "this increases power consumption and may lead to a quicker breakdown of the components .",
    "it also requires to have a counter - rotating body in order not to transfer angular momentum to the spacecraft .",
    "finally , the rotation may induce additional forces on the proof mass which would spoil the signal .",
    "a more convenient modulation technique consists in flipping microstar by @xmath119 rad , leading to a signal with a period called @xmath120 .",
    "this modulation scheme , shown in figure [ fig : modulation_signal ] , does not have the drawbacks of the previous one . in practice however , the rotation between 0 and @xmath119 rad is not as sharp as shown on the figure .",
    "indeed , the angular acceleration and angular velocity are kept small enough such that there is no loss of control of the proof mass due to forces exceeding the maximum range of control of the electrostatic actuation . as it was mentioned in the previous paragraph",
    ", the data acquired when the accelerometer is rotating may be spoiled by additional forces .",
    "therefore , in the case of the signal considered here , the data acquired when the accelerometer is rotating are not used .",
    "concerning the precision of the measured acceleration , called @xmath121 , it can be approximated by the following formula , whose squared value corresponds to the value of the noise spectrum at the modulated frequency divided by the integration time .",
    "@xmath122 where @xmath123 is given by equation ( [ eq : acc_noise ] ) , @xmath124 is the integration time and @xmath120 is the period of the modulation signal .",
    "this gives only an order of magnitude since the harmonics of the modulation signal are not taken into account . an exact formula for @xmath121",
    "can be derived but is beyond the scope of this article . assuming that @xmath125 min , that the integration time is @xmath126 h and that the only sources of noise and errors are the ones described in section [ subsection : performance ]",
    ", the precision achieved on the acceleration is then equal to @xmath127 pm s@xmath0 according to equation ( [ eq : precision ] ) .",
    "the exact derivation of the uncertainty for the signal of figure [ fig : modulation_signal ] gives @xmath128 pm s@xmath0 , with a modulation period @xmath125 min , a integration time @xmath129 h and a rotating time between the position 0 rad and @xmath119 rad equal to 120 s.    it is important to notice that the bias rejection system allows rejecting the bias of the two axes which are perpendicular to the axis of rotation . to remove the bias on the third axis",
    ", another rotating stage would be needed .",
    "the direction along which the absolute measurement of the non - gravitational acceleration is not required must therefore be the direction of the rotation axis . in the case of an interplanetary probe",
    ", this axis should be perpendicular to the orbit plane .",
    "the bias rejection system is similar , in its principle , to filter wheel used for space camera or to rotary actuator used for solar array drives , optical mechanism drives , deployment mechanisms and antenna pointing mechanisms .",
    "this section gives the requirements this subsystem has to meet in order to obtain the target accuracy of 1 pm s@xmath0 .",
    "the rotating stage is controlled by the icu through a closed loop with an encoder for detection of the rotation .",
    "the accuracy of the pointing knowledge of the rotating stage , called @xmath130 , is crucial to obtain the target accuracy called @xmath131 . calling the external acceleration @xmath132 ,",
    "the value of @xmath130 is given by @xmath133 assuming an external acceleration equal to @xmath134 m s@xmath0 and a target accuracy of @xmath128 pm s@xmath0 , the requirement on the angle is @xmath135 rad .",
    "concerning the wobble of the rotating stage , it has to be smaller than a value called @xmath136 given by : @xmath137 with the previous numerical values , the requirement on the wobble is @xmath138 rad .",
    "the square root in the value of @xmath136 comes from the fact that only the term at the order @xmath139 induces an error on the acceleration measured by the instrument ( the term of order one appears as a bias and is therefore removed ) .",
    "in the previous section , a precision of @xmath128 pm s@xmath0 on the acceleration measured by gap was obtained for an integration time of 5 h. equation ( [ eq : dynamics_final ] ) shows however that the force measured @xmath84 is proportional to the non - gravitational forces acting on the spacecraft @xmath65 plus a number of terms , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which can induce uncertainties on the measurement .",
    "@xmath76 , which describes the gold wire action was taken into account , and the two other terms , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , were supposed to be negligible .",
    "this section discusses this hypothesis .",
    "@xmath74 describes that the spacecraft is not a galilean reference frame ; and the components of @xmath75 are approximately constant in @xmath93 which means that it can be considered as an external acceleration which is modulated .",
    "as soon as the instrument is not at the center of inertia of the spacecraft and the spacecraft is rotating with respect to the solar system reference frame , term @xmath74 is not null .",
    "it has not been taken into account because it was supposed to be known precisely enough .",
    "this knowledge requires to measure with an accuracy compatible with the target accuracy of the instrument , the attitude of the satellite , its angular velocity and the position of the proof mass with respect to the center of mass of the satellite , i.e. the vector @xmath140 .",
    "the attitude of the satellite and its angular velocity are measured with star trackers .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath140 requires to measure the position of the instrument with respect to the satellite prior to launch and to precisely monitor the position of the center of inertia of the spacecraft , which may change due to the use of propellant .",
    "this knowledge , along with the mass of the spacecraft , is also needed to estimate the self - gravity @xmath141 which appears in the term @xmath75 .",
    "the only non - gravitational force , @xmath142 , possibly acting on the proof mass due to the exterior environment is electro - magnetic because the proof mass is protected by a hermetic housing .",
    "depending on the spacecraft on board which the instrument will be , this force may not be negligible .",
    "therefore , it may be required to measure the magnetic field in order to remove this contribution from the measurements .",
    "the difference of the gravitational acceleration can be constrained . by introducing @xmath143 the distance from the sun to the inertia center of the spacecraft and",
    "@xmath144 the distance between @xmath55 and @xmath64 , the following upper bound comes : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the gravitational constant and @xmath147 the mass of the sun . given conservative assumptions ",
    "the spacecraft is at one astronomical unit from the sun and @xmath144 is equals to 1 meter ",
    "the upper bound is equal to @xmath148 m s@xmath0 , which is one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath128 pm s@xmath0 .",
    "this short description of the `` parasitic '' terms in the measurement shows that the accommodation of the instrument in a spacecraft requires care .",
    "self - gravity may be reduced and better controlled if the instrument is placed at the center of mass of the spacecraft . as for the pointing system and the attitude control of the spacecraft",
    ", it must be compatible with the accuracy target of the instrument .",
    "the electrostatic accelerometer with bias rejection gap , designed to answer the need for large scale tests of general relativity and for planetary observations , relies on a new concept to make measurements of the non - gravitational acceleration with no bias .",
    "the main idea is to mount the electrostatic accelerometer microstar on a rotating stage , so that the external signal to be measured is modulated and distinguished from the bias of the accelerometer after post - treatment .",
    "the article presented the design of microstar as well as its spectral characterization .",
    "it also gave the main specifications on the bias rejection system .",
    "for a given modulation scheme , it is possible to derive the final precision on the acceleration measurement : with an integration time of five hours and a modulation period of 10 min , the precision is @xmath128 pm s@xmath0 on the measured acceleration .",
    "this opens the possibility to improve the accuracy on the comparison between the motion of the spacecraft and theoretical predictions by three orders of magnitude with respect to existing techniques .",
    "this accuracy leads to new applications for large scale tests of general relativity as well as for improved planetary observations .",
