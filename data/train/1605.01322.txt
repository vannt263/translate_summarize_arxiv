    "in a previous paper @xcite we introduced the so - called simplicial lusternik - schnirelmann category of a simplicial complex .",
    "this invariant , denoted by @xmath0 , is defined directly from the combinatorial structure of the complex @xmath1 , instead of considering the topological ls - category of the geometric realization @xmath2 , by replacing the notion of homotopy by that of contiguity . with this approach it turned out that the simplicial ls - category is an invariant of the strong homotopy type , as defined by barmak and minian in @xcite .",
    "also , simplicial ls - category is closely related to the ls - category of the finite @xmath3-space represented by the hasse diagram of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that although the idea of contiguous simplicial maps is a classic one , the corresponding theory of lusternik - schnirelmann category had not been developed until now .",
    "then , many natural questions remained unsolved in this new context .",

    "other results include a direct proof of the formula @xmath5 , for the barycentric subdivision , or a counterexample of the analogue of the homotopy extension property for subcomplexes",

    "the idea is to define an analogue of the classical ls - category of a topological space , by replacing the notion of homotopic maps by that of contiguous simplicial maps .",
    "we then prove some basic properties of this new notion of category , and we recall our previous result @xcite that @xmath6 is an invariant of the strong homotopy type . in particular , the category of the simplicial complex @xmath1 equals that of its core @xmath7 ( the minimal subcomplex of @xmath1 obtained by strong collapses ) . as a corollary",
    "we prove that @xmath0 is bounded above by the number of vertices and the number of maximal simplices of @xmath7 .    in section",
    "[ 3 ] we study the effect of barycentric subdivision on simplicial category and we give a direct proof of @xmath8 . for",
    "that we need to prove that if @xmath9 , @xmath10 are contiguous maps , then the induced maps @xmath11 , @xmath12 , are in the same contiguity class .",

    "[ 4 ] we compare the simplicial category of the complex @xmath1 with the classical ls - category of the geometric realization @xmath2 , proving that @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that @xmath14 , for any iterated barycentric subdivision @xmath15 of @xmath1 , although there are examples where this inequality is strict ( we show one of these kind of examples ) .",
    "section [ 5 ] deals with the study of simplicial products .",
    "being more precise , we consider the categorical product , denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "then , we prove that @xmath17 .",
    "we are now ( section [ 6 ] ) in a position to discuss the simplicial analogue of the whitehead formulation of the ls - category .",
    "it is known that for topological spaces @xmath18 with `` good '' properties the ls - category can be computed as the least integer @xmath19 such that the diagonal map @xmath20 factors ( up to homotopy ) through the so - called fat wedge @xmath21 .",
    "we try to adapt this result to abstract simplicial complexes .",
    "first , we define the @xmath22-th fat wedge @xmath23 for any pointed complex @xmath1 and we study its behaviour under contiguity .",
    "we then define a simplicial whitehead category @xmath24 , which is an invariant of the pointed strong homotopy type and we are able to prove that @xmath25 .",
    "however , unlike the continuous case , the other inequality is not true , as we show by an example .    in section [ 7 ]",
    "we show how the partial failure of the whitehead formulation is related to the contiguity extension property .",
    "we discuss a new notion of cofibration in the simplicial setting .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath26 is a subcomplex of a cw - complex @xmath18 then the pair @xmath27 has the homotopy extension property .",
    "therefore , if @xmath28 is a subcomplex of a simplicial complex @xmath1 , the pair @xmath29 has the ( topological ) homotopy extension property .",
    "we define a purely combinatorial analogue for a simplicial pair @xmath30 , but we show counterexamples where the contiguity extension property fails to be true .    finally , section [ 8 ] is focused on the study of the simplicial ls - category in the one - dimensional case , that is , on graphs . the well known graph - theoretical notion of _ arboricity _ will play a central role in this study .",
    "the arboricity @xmath31 of the graph @xmath32 is the cardinality of a minimal decomposition of @xmath32 into disjoint spanning forests , i.e. , acyclic subgraphs which are non - necessarily connected and cover all the vertices .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove that arboricity coincides with simplicial category , being more precise , we prove that @xmath33 .",
    "the two main ideas are that categorical subcomplexes are precisely forests and that the notion of contiguity is a very rigid one in the setting of graphs , allowing only a limited number of moves .",
    "as a final comment , we emphasize that simplicial ls - category is a new strong homotopy invariant , defined in purely combinatorial terms , that generalizes to arbitrary simplicial complexes the well known notion of arboricity of a graph , and that allows to develop all the machinery of algebraic topology which is costumary in the classical theory of lusternik - schnirelmann category .",

    "equivalently , the link of @xmath75 is a simplicial cone with vertex @xmath76 .        an _ elementary strong collapse _ consists of removing the open star of a dominated vertex @xmath75 from a simplicial complex @xmath1 . the inverse of a strong collapse is called a strong expansion . then , two simplicial complexes @xmath77 have the same _ strong homotopy type _ , denoted by @xmath78 , if they are related by a sequence of strong collapses and expansions .",

    "in contrast , in the one - dimensional case it holds the geometric category of the first barycentric subdivision always reaches the topological category of the geometric realization .",
    "in fact , the following result states that this is possible for a certain kind of `` local '' barycentric subdivision .    remember that any finite cw complex @xmath18 satifies @xmath494 , therefore @xmath495 for a non - contractible graph .",
    "let @xmath32 be a connected graph . if @xmath32 is a tree then @xmath496 . otherwise , let @xmath497 be the subdivision obtained from @xmath32 by only bisecting those edges out of a spanning tree in @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath498 .",
    "let us consider a spanning tree @xmath479 in @xmath32 .",
    "it is well known ( * ? ? ?",
    "1a.2 ) that there is a bijection between the edges out of a spanning tree and the basic cycles generating the one - dimensional homology of a graph . now ,",
    "after every edge out of @xmath479 is barycentrically subdivided , the subdivision @xmath497 of @xmath32 can be covered by two different ( non disjoint ) spanning trees @xmath499 and @xmath500 constructed as follows ( see figure [ sdk5 ] ) : @xmath499 is an expansion of @xmath479 which is obtained by adding one edge ( one of the subdivided ones ) on every leaf vertex of @xmath479 ; analogously , @xmath500 is obtained by adding the other edge ( not previously added to construct @xmath499 ) to all the leaf vertices of @xmath479 . by definition both @xmath499 and @xmath500 are spanning trees covering @xmath497 and hence @xmath498 .",
    "notice that for certain graphs , as the complete ones @xmath501 , the simplicial ls - category equals the topological ls - category of the realization of the graph by bisecting a fewer number of edges than the stated one by the above proposition .",
    "for example , for @xmath190 only three edges must be bisected in order to get @xmath502 ( see figure [ tresedges ] ) .",
    "[ geomgraph ] let @xmath32 be a connected graph .",
    "then @xmath503 .    taking into account the above results ,",
    "it is interesting to point out that , in the one - dimensional case , the difference @xmath504 can be arbitrarily large , as can be checked by considering the complete graph @xmath501 .",
