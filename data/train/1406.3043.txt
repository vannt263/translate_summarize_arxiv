    "observational evidence strongly points to an accelerated expansion of the universe , but the physical origin of this acceleration is still unknown .",
    "the observations include type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite radiation .",
    "the standard explanation invokes an unknown `` dark energy '' component which has the property that positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "observations indicate that dark energy occupies about 70% of the total energy of the universe , and the contribution of dark matter is @xmath5 26% .",
    "this accelerated expansion of the universe has also been strongly confirmed by some other independent experiments like sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) @xcite , wmap data analysis @xcite etc . over the past decade , there have been many theoretical models for mimicking the dark energy behaviors , such as the simplest ( just ) cosmological constant in which the equation of state is independent of the cosmic time and which can fit the observations well .",
    "this model is the so - called @xmath6cdm , containing a mixture of cosmological constant @xmath6 and cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "however , two problems arise from this scenario , namely `` fine - tuning '' and the `` cosmic coincidence '' problems . in order to solve these two problems ,",
    "many dynamical dark energy models were suggested , whose equation of state evolves with cosmic time . the scalar field or quintessence",
    "@xcite is one of the most favored candidate of dark energy which produce sufficient negative pressure to drive cosmic acceleration . in order to alleviate the cosmological - constant problems and explain the acceleration expansion ,",
    "many dynamical dark energy models have been proposed , such as k - essence , tachyon , phantom , quintom , chaplygin gas model , etc @xcite . also the interacting dark energy models including modified chaplygin gas @xcite , holographic dark energy model @xcite , and braneworld model @xcite have been proposed .",
    "recently , based on principle of quantum gravity , the agegraphic dark energy ( ade ) and the new agegraphic dark energy ( nade ) models were proposed by cai @xcite and wei et al @xcite respectively .",
    "the theoretical models have been tally with the observations with different data sets say tonry , gold sample data sets @xcite etc . in einstein s gravity , the modified chaplygin gas @xcite best fits with the 3 year wmap and the sdss data with the choice of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite which are improved constraints than the previous ones @xmath9 @xcite . +",
    "another possibility is that general relativity is only accurate on small scales and has to be modified on cosmological distances .",
    "one of these is modified gravity theories . in this case ,",
    "cosmic acceleration would arise not from dark energy as a substance but rather from the dynamics of modified gravity .",
    "modified gravity constitutes an interesting dynamical alternative to @xmath6cdm cosmology in that it is also able to describe the current acceleration in the expansion of our universe .",
    "one of the simplest modified gravity is dgp brane - world model @xcite .",
    "the other alternative approach dealing with the acceleration problem of the universe is changing the gravity law through the modification of action of gravity by means of using @xmath10 gravity @xcite instead of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "some of these models , such as @xmath11 and logarithmic models , provide an acceleration for the universe at the present time @xcite .",
    "other modified gravity includes @xmath12 gravity , @xmath13 gravity , gauss - bonnet gravity , horava - lifshitz gravity , brans - dicke gravity , etc @xcite .",
    "+ of late an infrared modification of classical gravitation was proposed , as a generalization of the 4d effective theory in the dgp model @xcite .",
    "the theory considers a self - interaction term of the form @xmath14 in order to recover gr in high density regions .",
    "the most striking feature of the theory is that it is invariant under the galileon shift symmetry , @xmath15 , in the minkowski background . due to this invariance",
    "the equation of motion remains a second order differential equation , preventing the introduction of extra degrees of freedom , which are usually associated with instabilities .",
    "so we assume the frw universe in galileon gravity model filled with the dark matter and the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) type dark energy . in @xcite the observational constraints of mcg",
    "was studied in rs ii brane . in @xcite the observational constraints of mcg was studied in lqc .",
