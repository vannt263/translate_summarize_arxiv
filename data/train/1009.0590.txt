    "it is also possible to make nano- and microstructures based on such thin films .",
    "these nanostructures are generally of much higher quality than those , used in earlier experiments@xcite , which , in particular , were not completely free of pinning centers .",
    "it is well known that the lower the dimensionality of the system the stronger the thermal fluctuations .",
    "ultrathin superconducting films as well as nanostructures based on such films are obvious candidates for the observation of thermal fluctuations .",
    "indeed , it was reported very recently that strong current - induced thermal fluctuations of the order parameter were observed in superconducting nanowires fabricated in a meander of nbnbartolf .",
    "structures of this kind are used in highly - sensitive photodetectors .",
    "it turns out that the fluctuations are a main source of dark - count events in such photodetectors : this means that their effect is actually parasitic .",
    "fluctuation phenomena were interpreted in terms of a thermally - activated entry of vortices , as well as by unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs@xcite . in another recent experimentcren ,",
    "no hysteresis for vortex penetration and expulsion was observed in the case of a nanoisland of pb , which was so small that it could accommodate only one vortex . in a similar experiment@xcite ,",
    "performed at lower temperature , some hysteresis was detected , but the width of the hysteresis region was significantly smaller than expected from theory .",
    "a theoretical explanation for these phenomena was very recently suggested by one of us in terms of a thermal suppression of the surface barrier for vortex entry / exit , which might occur in superconducting nanoislands made of pb in the regime of the ultimate single vortex confinement@xcite .",
    "previously , thermal activation of vortices over the surface barrier was demonstrated to be possible in high-@xmath0 low - dimensional structures@xcite .",
    "geometry itself can play an important role in fluctuation phenomena .",
    "the shape of islands , prepared by the method of evaporation in ultrahigh vacuum , depends strongly on their sizes .",
    "they grow according to the stranski - krastanov scenario , i.e. , starting from well - facetted nucleicren . as a result ,",
    "islands with lateral dimensions of nearly 100 nm and smaller have a hexagonal shape , while larger islands tend to have a triangular shape [ see , e.g. , fig .",

    "the aim of the present paper is to explore how triangularity , or more generally the presence of sharp corners in a thin superconducting structure , influences _ thermal fluctuations _ of the order parameter .",
    "the motivation to study the triangular geometry , apart from possible links with experiments , is that one can expect thermal fluctuations to be stronger in the corners of a triangular structure as compared to its interior , since the superconducting condensate in the corners is strongly confined by samples s borders .",
    "this implies that the system somehow is characterized by lower effective dimensionality than in the interior .",
    "it is however not evident a priori if this rather general argument leads to any noticeable effect for the fluctuations of the order parameter in a triangle , so that more careful inspection is certainly desirable . in order to reveal the effect of geometry on spatial localization of thermal fluctuations ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of zero applied field , but we consider temperatures both below and above @xmath0 .",
    "we apply the method of small - amplitude oscillations within the ginzburg - landau theory , and we do not consider the possible excitation of vortices .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "the derivation presented in this section applies for the case of temperatures below @xmath0 .",
    "it is straightforward to adopt it for the case of temperatures above @xmath0 .",
    "we start with the dimensionless ginzburg - landau functional for the superconducting energy of the island of thickness @xmath1 , in zero applied field :    @xmath2    where integration is performed over the cross section of the nanostructure , @xmath3 is the dimensionless order parameter .",

    "the boundary condition for the order parameter at each of the three edges of a sample is taken in its usual form for the case of a superconductor / vacuum interface@xmath8where @xmath9  is the unit vector in the direction perpendicular to the edge .",
    "let us now estimate the ratio @xmath10 of the energy needed to suppress the order parameter to zero within the volume @xmath11 and the thermal energy @xmath12 , using realistic values for all parameters for typical ultrathin nanostructures made of pb that have been realized in recent experiments .",
    "we define @xmath10  as@xmath13for the penetration depth , we use the usual expression@xcite for dirty superconductors , @xmath14 where @xmath15  nm is the penetration depth in bulk pb , @xmath16 is the quasiparticle mean free part , and @xmath17 k. then , for a film of thickness 2 nm ( similar to ref .",

    "in order to circumvent this difficulty , we will use , with certain modifications , an approach applied very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite for the triangular dot of graphene , for which exact electronic wave functions were found .",
    "the major difference with the graphene dot problem is in the boundary condition , which is vanishing of the wave function at the triangle s border , instead of the vanishing of its first derivative [ eq .",

    "different curves show the behavior of @xmath63 along straight lines connecting various points inside the triangle , which are depicted in fig .",

    "on @xmath62 along different paths within the triangular structure below @xmath0 .",
    "red line shows @xmath96 along the path , which originates from the corner .",
    "blue line corresponds to path , which starts from the edge towards the interior of the structure .",
    "green line shows @xmath96 starting from the interior to the edge.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the shape of all these curves is similar and it generally resembles the behavior of the same correlation function for an isotropic infinite two - dimensional system .",
    "namely , it first grows rapidly with increasing @xmath62 and then starts to demonstrate a smoother behavior .",
    "there are , however , obvious differences between the curves , both quantitative and qualitative . first , it is seen that the initial increase of @xmath63 is much larger [ several times ] for those paths which originate from the corner [ curves @xmath83 and @xmath84 ] , where , according to our initial guess , fluctuations are stronger . thus , we can conclude that this guess is justified .",
    "second , @xmath63 along the curve @xmath83 starts to rapidly increase again , when approaching the other corner , while the such an increase for other curves is not so pronounced .",
    "this feature implies that the order parameter between _ different _ corners is more decoherent , which again supports our hypothesis .",
    "for the range of parameters used here , we see that the maximum @xmath98 is nearly 0.4 , which implies that the coherence between the order parameter inside different corners starts to be lost .",
    "figure 3 gives the density - density correlation function @xmath96 for three directions , along paths @xmath83 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we again see that the correlation function in the corner [ @xmath83 ] is much larger than the same function in the interior [ @xmath85 and @xmath86 ] .",
    "this shows that not only the phase of the order parameter , but also the density of superconducting electrons fluctuates stronger in the corners .",
    "it is also of interest to note that the comparison of @xmath96 along paths @xmath85 and @xmath86  shows that fluctuations are stronger near the triangle s surface as compared to the central part of the nanostructure .",
    "the strength of thermal fluctuations at the given point @xmath64 may be characterized by the density - density correlation function @xmath96 with @xmath101 averaged over all such values of @xmath102@xcite .",
    "although @xmath103 is usually peaked within nearly @xmath104 in the corners for various triangle s sizes , such an averaging implies that the typical width of the geometry - induced fluctuating region in each of the three corners is broader : we estimate it to be several @xmath4 .",
    "indicating the region where fluctuations are more pronounced.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to visualize the effect of geometry on thermal fluctuations , we construct a `` phase diagram '' for the case of a triangular pb nanostructure with the edge length @xmath105 and thickness @xmath106 nm .",
    "we take @xmath84 path [ along the bisector ] and for each point @xmath107 at this path we calculate @xmath108 , which shows the average fluctuation of the density of superconducting electrons .",
    "we have chosen the following qualitative criterion : if this quantity exceeds 0.15 at a certain temperature , we enter the fluctuative regime .",
    "our results for the crossover between low - temperature and fluctuative regimes are presented in fig . 4 in the plane of the distance along the @xmath84 path and @xmath109 .",
    "we indeed see that the characteristic temperature for the crossover in the corners strongly depends on the position .",
    "of course , the transition between the two domains in fig .",
    "4 is not abrupt .",
    "it is more appropriate to talk of different regimes , which are separated by a crossover region .",
    "thus , the suggested picture is very qualitative and it is given for illustrative purposes to supplement an idea we want to convey .",
    "on @xmath62 along different paths within the triangular structure above @xmath0 .",
    "red line shows @xmath110 along the path , which originates from the corner .",
    "blue line corresponds to path , which starts from the edge towards the interior of the structure .",
    "green line shows @xmath110 starting from the interior to the edge.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the order parameter correlation function @xmath110 above @xmath0 , defined in eq .",
    "( 27 ) , has to decrease@xcite with increasing @xmath62 .",
    "the results of our calculations for @xmath110 along different paths are presented in fig . 5 , where the correlation function is plotted for @xmath111 for the triangle with length @xmath81  [ in terms of @xmath4 ] .",
    "@xmath110 is normalized by its value @xmath113 in the point 5 , which is located in the central part of the nanostructure [ `` bulk '' ] .",
    "we indeed see the expected rapid decay of @xmath110 with increasing @xmath62 , but again the correlation function calculated along the path , which originates from the corner [ @xmath83 ] , is rather different from those , which correspond to lines inside the interior of the structure .",
    "namely , the average value of the density of superconducting electrons induced by thermal fluctuations is much larger in the corners .",
    "fluctuations near the surface are stronger than far from the surface [ curves @xmath85 and @xmath86 ] . the width of the geometry - enhanced fluctuating region in the corners is again estimated to be several @xmath4 .",
    "the comparison of our results for the correlation functions below and above @xmath0 shows that superconductivity is getting suppressed , below @xmath0 , starting from the corners , while , above @xmath0 , the order parameter preferentially nucleates again in the corners .",
    "however , there is no contradiction , since if we consider a triangle with _",
    "fixed _ sizes and if we start to increase @xmath114 towards @xmath0 , @xmath4  becomes infinitely large at @xmath0 .",
    "this means that , close enough to @xmath0 on both sides of the transition , the triangle is actually in the zero - dimensional regime , so that the order parameter does not vary in space . in other words ,",
    "the fluctuating region in the vicinity of @xmath0 expands from the corners to the whole structure , while by tuning temperature away from @xmath0 , one can make thermal fluctuations stronger in the corners than in the interior .",
    "of course , the length of the triangle s edge should be much larger than @xmath115 in order to see such a spatial localization of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the geometry - induced localization of thermal fluctuations is expected to occur in nanostructures of various shapes , not only triangular ones .",
    "the general tendency is obvious : the sharper the corner , the stronger the fluctuations in this corner . for instance , in the corners of square - shaped samples , the width of the fluctuative region can be expected to be much smaller than in the corners of the triangular structures .",
    "we have studied thermal fluctuations of the order parameter in quasi - two - dimensional superconducting structures of triangular shape .",
    "we considered the case of zero applied field both below and above @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that the order parameter exhibits much larger fluctuations in the corners of the structure and the width of such a geometry - induced fluctuating region is several @xmath4 .",
    "this unusual behavior can be attributed to the fact that the confinement of the condensate in the corners lowers locally the effective dimensionality of the system , thus making thermal fluctuations more pronounced .",
    "the condensate in the corners can serve as a source of thermal noise in superconducting devices based on ultrathin nano- and microstructures .",
