    "despite much recent progress @xcite , background - independent approaches to quantum gravity face several open challenges . these concern : ( i ) the definition of the quantum dynamics of the fundamental degrees of freedom of spacetime that they identify , and the full control over it ; ( ii ) the recovery of an effective description in terms of a smooth spacetime and geometry , once the dynamics is somehow defined , and in particular when the fundamental degrees of freedom are not continuous geometric data ; ( iii ) the contact with the effective dynamics of general relativity and quantum field theory , and with phenomenology .",
    "an example is given by loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , a background - independent framework aiming to quantize the gravitational degrees of freedom in a nonperturbative way @xcite .",
    "to this purpose , a canonical quantization scheme is employed where the constraints are written in terms of the densitized triad and of the ashtekar  barbero connection .",
    "the end result at the kinematical level is a hilbert space of ( spin network ) states associated with graphs embedded in the spatial manifold and labeled by algebraic data ( lorentz group elements or corresponding representation labels ) . as in any canonical scheme , while geometry is fully dynamical , the topology of the universe is fixed by construction , at least at the beginning . in general",
    ", however , one may ask whether it is possible to build a quantum theory inclusive of topology change or , in other words , if one can envisage an interacting multiverse scenario obeying a set of quantum rules .",
    "since the degrees of freedom of a single universe are already fields , eventually to be quantized , such a scenario is sometimes said to be one of `` third quantization . ''",
    "this can be achieved , at least at a formal level , by defining a field theory over the space of geometries , for given spatial topology @xcite .",
    "other ( albeit inconclusive ) arguments from a canonical quantum gravity perspective in favor of going to a `` third - quantization '' setting were also offered in @xcite .    beside the issue of topology change ,",
    "the main difficulty faced by the lqg approach is the complete definition of the quantum dynamics and the proof that the resulting theory leads back to einstein s gravity in an appropriate limit .",
    "a tentative but complete definition of the quantum dynamics of spin network states is obtained , via spin foam models @xcite ( a covariant definition of lqg dynamics ) , by embedding lqg states into the larger framework of group field theories ( gft ) @xcite , in turn strictly related to tensor models @xcite .",
    "these are quantum field theories on group manifolds whose states are indeed spin networks and whose feynman amplitudes are spin - foam models .",
    "this embedding has several advantages , from the lqg point of view .",
    "first of all , as said , it provides a complete definition of the quantum dynamics .",
    "second , it defines such dynamics as the superposition of interaction processes ( creation and annihilation ) of spin - network vertices , forming complexes of arbitrary topology , such that topology is naturally made dynamical ; it provides , in other words , a sort of local field - quantization scheme @xcite .",
    "third , the field - theory framework offers powerful mathematical and conceptual tools for tackling the issue of the continuum limit and of the extraction of effective dynamics for better contact with phenomenology . in doing so , however , one has to abandon the familiar framework of canonical quantization of a classical ( and local ) field theory of gravitation , and is forced to face new types of conceptual and mathematical difficulties .",
    "this program is just as ambitious as the original lqg one , if not more , and is difficult to realize in a complete and rigorous way , despite many recent advances .",
    "toy models inspired by the full theory then become very important .",
    "in fact , they fulfill three main purposes : ( i ) they offer a simplified testing ground for ideas and techniques developed in the full theory ; ( ii ) as such , they also have an important pedagogical value ; ( iii ) they may represent , in principle , an effective , approximate framework to which the full quantum dynamics may reduce , in some limit , and thus they may be directly applicable to phenomenological studies .",
    "obviously , due to their simplicity , one should be cautious in interpreting the result obtained in the context of such toy models as truly physical , and their validity can be assessed only once the relation between toy model and full theory has been understood .",
    "an important type of simplified scenario has been developed in the context of lqg , in a symmetry - reduced setting of interest for cosmology .",
    "in fact , in order to understand certain features of loop quantum gravity , one often resorts to a minisuperspace model , loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) , where degrees of freedom are drastically reduced @xcite . in a pure friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker ( frw ) universe filled with a massless free scalar field , the classical and quantum dynamics of the universe as a whole can be described by the same formalism used for a free particle . in particular , the path integral is well defined @xcite and two - point correlation functions admit the usual classification @xcite . by now , a wealth of interesting results have been obtained in this context @xcite . given this analogy with the free particle , it is all the more natural to ask oneself if one can construct a sensible `` interaction '' among frw universes and , once this is done , to change the interpretation of the two - point function from particle transition amplitude to field propagator as in the usual field quantization .",
    "one would then write down a field theory on minisuperspace , to obtain a field - quantized lqc framework . another way to see the same field theory",
    "would then be as a toy model for group field theory , in which many of the difficult features of the latter are absent due to the global nature of the formulation and to the simplification provided by symmetry reduction , but where some ideas and techniques can still be applied .",
    "as with any toy model , one would then use it as a pedagogical testing ground and keep it available as a possible effective description of the full theory .",
    "we propose such a field theory for ( loop ) quantum cosmology in this paper , with the above motivations .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows .",
    "we review some basic features of lqc in sec .",

    "dewitt case is also easily recovered . in sec .",
    "[ gufc ] the field theory is defined by promoting the quantum hamiltonian constraint to the kinetic operator of a ( real ) scalar field @xmath0 on minisuperspace .",
    "we analyze the relation between different kinetic operators and the gauge choice , with particular focus on exactly solvable free theories .",
    "we discuss the various possible choices for the interaction term . following this general definition , we move on to analyze some consequences of the formalism .",
    "we analyze the free propagator of the theory first , corresponding to the evolution of a single universe ( sec .  [ fft ] ) .",
    "we show how the embedding into a field - theory setting has immediate interesting consequences also for the single - universe dynamics . then",
    ", we consider how the presence of interactions affects this single - universe evolution .",
    "approximating the interaction as a mean - field term , we find an effective equation linear in the field @xmath0 , correcting the hamiltonian quantum constraint equation by an extra term ( sec .",
    "[ mfa ] ) .",
    "the latter mixes , in general , gravitational and matter degrees of freedom , and its exact form depends on the chosen initial interaction as well as on the mean - field configuration considered . we conclude with a discussion of other possible applications of this formalism .",
    "our starting point is the description within loop quantum cosmology of the spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe with a massless scalar field as matter , which we summarize briefly in this section . in the canonical analysis of dimensionally - reduced general relativity ,",
    "one restricts integrations to a fixed fiducial three - dimensional cell of comoving volume @xmath1 , with a flat metric @xmath2 which may be taken to be @xmath3 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the four - dimensional metric is then ds^2 = -n^2(t ) dt^2 + a^2(t)^0 q_abdx^adx^b , [ frwmetric ] where @xmath4 is the scale factor , spatial indices are labeled by latin indices @xmath5 , and there is a freedom in the choice of the lapse function @xmath6 .",

    "although this differs from the more standard choice of symbol @xmath24 or @xmath25 , it has the further advantage of avoiding confusion with the hubble parameter . ]",
    "focusing on the gravitational sector for now , the crucial difference from traditional minisuperspace ( wheeler  dewitt ) approaches to quantum cosmology in lqc is that one follows the kinematics of full loop quantum gravity , where not the connection but only its holonomies are defined as operators @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce new conjugate variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where c=_0 ^ 1/3=-,p = a^2_0 ^ 2/3 , so that @xmath14 only depends on @xmath26 , and powers of @xmath28 have been introduced to make @xmath26 and @xmath27 invariant under the residual symmetry @xmath29 , @xmath30 in eq .",

    "the hilbert space of the coupled system is then just the tensor product @xmath51 . as in traditional approaches to quantum cosmology",
    ", the variable @xmath19 is removed from the configuration space because the primary constraint @xmath22 would mean that wavefunctions are independent from @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the full constraint would be a multiple of @xmath19 , so that in situations where the resulting quantum constraint depends on the choice of lapse function ( as below ) the choice @xmath52 seems more natural when considering that @xmath19 is also originally in the configuration space .",
    "in fact , in cosmology the lapse can be regarded as a function of the scale factor , @xmath53 , which is an independent variable .",
    "a choice of the form @xmath54 in the full theory is somewhat less justified before solving the constraints .",
    "the quantum analogue of the friedmann equation ( [ friedm ] ) is obtained by starting with the hamiltonian constraint of full general relativity in terms of the variables ( [ lqgvaria ] ) and expressing the curvature of @xmath14 through the holonomy around a loop , taking account of the _ area gap _ the result in lqg that the area of such a loop can not assume arbitrarily small nonzero values .",

    "the above is rather general .",
    "explicit analyses require choosing specific interaction terms , that is , functions @xmath71 .",
    "each of them could correspond to a choice of a physical quantity to be conserved through the `` interaction '' of the universes , and of a conjugate physical quantity in terms of which the fields interact , instead , `` locally . ''",
    "that means that the conjugate variable is identified across `` incoming '' and `` outgoing '' universes .",
    "different choices for the function @xmath76 , and hence for the quantities conserved in the interaction , can thus be motivated by different physical considerations .",
    "in particular , the choice will be influenced by the interpretation of such an interaction as true topology change , that is , splitting / merging of universes , or rather as a merging / splitting of homogeneous and isotropic patches within a single inhomogeneous and anisotropic universe .",
    "the detailed definition of the second scenario in physical terms is not easy , and we will confine our treatment to a brief discussion of it at the end . however , it is important to keep in mind that its consideration would sensibly affect the very definition of the field theory to analyze .",
    "examples of interactions are :    * if , e.g. , only @xmath77 is nonvanishing and we implement locality in ( @xmath78 ) by choosing @xmath79 , we have the field equation ( , ) + ^2(,)=0 .",
    "such a potential , which implements locality both in the 3-volume ( i.e. , the scale factor ) and in the scalar field @xmath17 , implies the existence of conservation laws for the conjugate quantities @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these conservation laws are nothing but the ( modified ) second friedmann and klein  gordon equations , respectively .",
    "since interactions allow for topology change , in this case for nonzero @xmath77 there is a process where two `` universes '' merge into one , and the metric in both ingoing patches as well as in the outgoing patch is required to be the same ( analogous to the interaction term proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "because of the conservation law , there is a discontinuity in the hubble parameter @xmath82 . * a different conservation law , namely conservation of hubble volume @xmath83 or locality in the conjugate quantity @xmath84 ,",
    "is suggested if one interprets the interaction as the topology - changing process just described with a discontinuity in the causal past of an observer passing the `` merging point '' ( this is typically considered `` bad '' topology change ; see the review @xcite ) .",
    "* another possibility would be to take the conserved quantities of the classical ( wheeler  dewitt ) hamiltonian @xmath81 and @xmath85 as also conserved in interactions , which would then be local in @xmath17 and @xmath86 .",

    "dewitt case , we can choose the type of interaction analogously , since the only difference is in the kinetic operator ( choice of first - quantization scheme ) and not in the choice of minisuperspace variables .    before starting our analysis of the model",
    ", we introduce a reformulation of the same that is advantageous for practical manipulations .",

    ", any statement about the explicit form of the contribution to @xmath66 will strongly depend not only on the chosen field configuration @xmath146 , but also on the form of the interactions in our model , which are not strongly constrained .",
    "let us discuss possible results for this effective hamiltonian dynamics , and how to obtain them .",
    "a possibility which has been suggested by studies in lqc @xcite is that , for a `` monomial '' interaction , the gft coupling constant @xmath147 is related to the cosmological constant @xmath148 .",
    "this possibility had been also considered previously @xcite , but , in analogy with matrix models and tensor models and with the `` third - quantization '' model of @xcite , the coupling @xmath147 would be expected to be related to the _ exponential of the cosmological constant _ rather than @xmath148 itself . for example",
    ", the formal arguments of @xcite suggest that a second - quantized field - theory feynman amplitude should correspond to @xmath149 evaluated on the classical spacetime represented by the feynman diagram .",
    "our simplified scheme suggests another way to obtain a relation between a fundamental field - quantized coupling and an effective cosmological constant . under the assumption that our toy cosmological model comes out from some more fundamental gft dynamics , and",
    "thus that the coupling constant of the toy model can be related to the fundamental gft interactions , the mean field approximation can relate very directly the coupling constant of the cosmological model to an effective cosmological constant in the single - universe dynamics ( free theory ) , that is , in an effective hamiltonian constraint .",
    "let us see how this can happen .",
    "the effective contribution to @xmath66 should be of the form @xmath150 .",
    "this term grows with large @xmath44 and , for a trivial polynomial interaction ( that is , trivial interaction kernels @xmath151 ) , presumably it could not come from a normalizable @xmath0 . however , a general choice of interaction functional , such as that in eq .",
    "( [ intact ] ) , can accommodate an effective cosmological constant .",
    "actually , it can even reproduce a nonconstant scalar - field potential term , _",
    "v = v()b()^2 , for example of the type that would be needed for inflation in the early universe .",
    "take , again , @xmath152 and eq .  ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "the contribution in @xmath75 is nontrivial only if the effective hamiltonian is nonlocal , otherwise it would just be an extra piece defining the initial hamiltonian constraint .",
    "since we are interested in a local constraint , we can ignore it , set @xmath153 , and absorb @xmath77 in the potential @xmath154 . then , a function @xmath155 that happens to match the behavior of the mean - field vacuum and contains the appropriate dependence on @xmath44 and @xmath17 on top of it would be f_3(_i,_i)&= & ( _ 1-_2)(_2-_3)__1,_2__2,_3 + & & v(_3)b(_3)_3 ^ 2[_0(_3,_3)]^-1 .",
    "[ f3 ] notice that , by construction , @xmath155 is symmetric with respect to all its arguments .    clearly , this is rather _ ad hoc _ and one should have an independent justification ( and possibly a full derivation from a fundamental gft ) for a given choice of interactions @xmath155 , _ such that _ the wished - for effective hamiltonian constraint comes out , _ for a reasonable choice of nonperturbative vacuum _ which should also be independently justified .",
    "however , the above derivation proves an intriguing possibility , to be explored further : an underlying , more fundamental dynamics of creation / annihilation of universes , i.e. , topology change , or of merging / splitting of homogeneous and isotropic patches within a single universe could result , at an effective level , in a nontrivial potential term for the ( homogeneous and isotropic ) scalar field , and a cosmological constant term .",
    "notice also that , in the first - quantized lqc and wheeler  dewitt frameworks , the presence of a potential spoils the separation of positive - frequency and negative - frequency sectors , as recalled , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "this is not an issue in our second - quantized model ( being a field theory ) , and we are able to generate a scalar potential ( nontrivial in the inflationary early universe ) without formally changing the structure of the free theory .",
    "with the same procedure , we can obtain also other types of effective contributions , for instance a nonvanishing curvature @xmath156 ( closed and open universe , respectively ) .",
    "it is sufficient to replace v()v()-^1/3 in eq .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) to obtain an effective spatial curvature term of the form one finds in the classical friedmann equation .",
    "it is also straightforward to obtain an effective hamiltonian constraint corresponding to , e.g. , the @xmath157 model in lqc @xcite .",
    "in fact also in that case the term corresponding to spatial curvature only acts by multiplication with a function of @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper we outlined the construction of a field theory of universes drawing inspiration from the perspective advanced in quantum gravity by group field theory , and by the general idea of `` third quantization of gravity , '' that had been advanced in the early days of the subject @xcite .",
    "we have also studied various aspects of the formalism , in particular the consequences it has for the single - universe dynamics , that is , for the standard ( loop ) quantum cosmology setting .",
    "these come already from the embedding of the canonical dynamics within a field theory , as encoded in the free field theory .",
    "more interesting consequences , of course , come from the existence of interactions , which , we showed , can be taken into account via mean field approximation .",
    "given the subject , and the current level of understanding of the fundamental theory ( in either the lqg or in the gft formulation ) , our goal was then in many respects necessarily of an exploratory nature .",
    "in particular , the least developed point of the discussion concerns the choice of interaction . as in all simplified models for cosmology , however , the main task will be to better justify the assumptions and the dynamics chosen from the fundamental theory , and to possibly show how such a simplified model can emerge naturally in some sectors of the full theory .",
    "understanding this issue will also clarify the role and physical significance of conserved currents within the model .    before concluding",
    ", we should mention an alternative view of the physics of this `` group field cosmology , '' that we anticipated in passing in the course of our presentation . while loop quantum or wheeler ",
    "dewitt cosmology describe a single evolving quantum universe , in the field cosmological model one has many - particle interacting states . instead of interpreting them as @xmath70 distinct universes merging and splitting in topology - changing `` scattering '' processes",
    ", one could think of them as @xmath70 frw patches which , collected together , approximate a single inhomogeneous universe .",
    "this is reminiscent of the separate universe approach @xcite , where inflationary large - wavelength perturbations are represented as spatial gradients among homogeneous patches of hubble size . in each patch",
    "centered at some spatial point @xmath158 , one has a `` local '' scale factor @xmath159 , hubble parameter @xmath160 , and so on .",
    "in particular , the local scale factor @xmath161 $ ] encodes both the minisuperspace variable @xmath18 and the nonlinear scalar perturbation @xmath162 .",
    "linear perturbations can then be identified with gradients . at the linear level , @xmath163 $ ] ; call @xmath164 .",
    "one has @xmath165/(x_1^i - x_2^i)\\sim \\partial_i a(t,{\\bf x})$ ] , so that , up to a numerical factor , for a perturbation of wavelength @xmath147 we get @xmath166 .    in our field - theory picture",
    ", the present - day universe would resemble some configuration of many particles ( regions of linear size @xmath167 ) that looks homogeneous to high precision at large scales .",
    "this could be a condensate phase of the theory where discrete translation invariance in the @xmath44 variable is spontaneously broken , as is known for systems in condensed matter physics .",
    "then , the challenge would be to define a model whose collective behavior agrees with the standard cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "however , the resulting action would be nonlocal in order to accommodate the infinite multiplicity of spatial points into a finite - dimensional , minisuperspace - like phase space .",
    "for instance , following the above - mentioned gradient expansion , a linear perturbation would be defined via the `` interaction '' of two patches in a nonlocal quadratic term : da dda d f(a , a,,)(a,)(a, ) , where @xmath168 is a function which should encode the correct dynamics to match with the perturbed hamiltonian constraint .",
    "just as we did for the effective hamiltonian constraint in the previous section , one could explicitly calculate @xmath168 from this perturbed hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the main difficulty to overcome , in developing properly the separate universe perspective of our second - quantized cosmology , is to develop first a proper quantum cosmology version of the separate universe approach to cosmological perturbations .",
    "admittedly , it is unclear at the present stage whether applying our framework to the problem of cosmological perturbations has practical advantages over conventional strategies , unless some conservation law be implemented .",
    "it is yet another possibility worth exploring , however . on the other hand , the implementation of the separate universe idea within a field - theoretic formalism like",
    "the one we propose could have a better chance of being derived from fundamental formulations of quantum gravity such as gft .",
    "this would give a more solid ground to this way of dealing with cosmological perturbations and also offer a way to test fundamental models via their cosmological predictions .",

    "<S> following the idea of a field quantization of gravity as realized in group field theory , we construct a minisuperspace model where the wavefunction of canonical quantum cosmology ( either wheeler  dewitt or loop quantum cosmology ) is promoted to a field , the coordinates are minisuperspace variables , the kinetic operator is the hamiltonian constraint operator , and the action features a nonlinear and possibly nonlocal interaction term . we discuss free - field classical solutions , the quantum propagator , and a mean - field approximation linearizing the equation of motion and augmenting the hamiltonian constraint by an effective term mixing gravitational and matter variables . depending on the choice of interaction , </S>",
    "<S> this can reproduce , for example , a cosmological constant , a scalar - field potential , or a curvature contribution . </S>"
