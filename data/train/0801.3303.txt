    "extensive x - ray observations have revealed that almost completely ionized hot gas medium permeates within clusters of galaxies with a typical temperature range of @xmath1 k and a range of typical electron number density @xmath2 ( e.g. , cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1978 ; sarazin 1988 ; fabian 1994 ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies are largely gravitationally bound systems on spatial scales of several mpcs ; together with the strong evidence of high velocity dispersions of galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) , hot x - ray emitting thermal electron gas , and gravitational lensing effects , we have realized the presence of massive dark matter halo within clusters of galaxies . physical properties of galaxy clusters with static models of spherical symmetry have been extensively studied in the past ( e.g. , lea 1975 ; cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 , 1978 ; sarazin & bahcall 1977 ; sarazin 1988 ; fabian 1994 ; carilli & taylor 2002 ; voit 2005 ) .    in the past several years",
    ", high - resolution x - ray imaging observations have revealed density , temperature and pressure jumps in the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) within clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "2003 ; nulsen et al . 2005a",
    "; nulsen et al . 2005b ; mcnamara et al . 2005 ) , indicating that these structures are likely large - scale shocks rather than cold fronts ( e.g. , sanders & fabian 2006 ) . active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. , nulsen et al . 2005a ; nulsen et al .",
    "2005b ; mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ) and merging galaxies ( e.g. , markevitch & vikhlinin 2001 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ; gabici & blasi 2003 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2005 ) are proposed to be the driving force and energy source of these large - scale shocks .",
    "in addition , large - scale sound waves in clusters of galaxies have been proposed by sanders & fabian ( 2007 ) to explain the observed quasi - concentric ripples in surface brightness of x - ray emissions .",
    "once shocks are identified in clusters of galaxies , there must be large - scale flows involved . in other words , these clusters of galaxies can not be really static on large scales at least in the spatial region where shocks are presumably identified .",
    "relative to the cluster centre , radial distances of shocks observed vary from tens of kpcs ( e.g. , mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ; nulsen et al .",
    "2005b ) to several mpcs ( e.g. , a3667 in rotteringer et al . 1997 ; a3376 in bagchi et al . 2006 ; galaxy clusters a786 , a2255 , a2256 in ensslin et al .",
    "1998 ) ; at yet smaller radii around the centre , there could be emerging shocks that may not be easily identified .",
    "we take the point of view that these shocks are moving in hot icm and we simply catch them at different epochs of evolution .",
    "these shocks may all be born somewhere around the central region and travel outwards to the locations we observe at the present epoch . for those clusters of galaxies without shock signatures ,",
    "one possibility is that shocks have occurred in the distant past and have disappeared after their energies were dissipated during the process of propagation .",
    "so large - scale shocks and flows may well be common phenomena in clusters of galaxies .    on much smaller scales compared to those of clusters of galaxies , x",
    "- rays have been also observed in globular clusters ( e.g. , verbunt et al .",
    "1984 ) and these emissions are interpreted by some as associated with flowing gas towards a black hole residing in the centre of globular clusters ( e.g. , silk & arons 1975 ) .",
    "moreover , outflows of gas materials from globular clusters have also been discussed in the literature ( e.g. , vandenberg 1978 ) .",
    "fully relaxed globular clusters can be well treated as spherically symmetric ( e.g. , harris & racine 1979 ) .",
    "one may view the collection of stars as one ` fluid ' and the tenuous gas as another fluid ; these two fluids are coupled together by gravity on large scales . here , we note globular clusters in passing and will mainly focus on large - scale self - similar dynamics for clusters of galaxies .    with these two classes of astrophysical systems in mind ,",
    "we develop a theoretical model framework of spherical symmetry to study dynamic behaviours of hot icm and dark matter halo using the two - fluid approximation ( e.g. , lou 2005 ) , where the two polytropic fluids are coupled together by gravity .",
    "we should note that here the notion of a polytropic fluid is fairly general in the sense of specific entropy conservation along streamlines ( lou & cao 2007 ) .    in the context of large - scale structure formation",
    ", extensive numerical works have been carried out to simulate the formation of galaxy clusters in the expanding universe , providing information for the hot icm and dark matter halo ( see , e.g. , bertschinger 1998 for a review on numerical simulations of structure formation in the universe ) .",
    "evrard ( 1990 ) and thomas & couchman ( 1992 ) simulated properties ( such as the number density and temperature profiles ) of a hot gas in the presence of a dark matter halo . in katz & white ( 1993 ) and frenk et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the radial cooling process is simulated .",
    "in particular , evrard et al .",
    "( 1994 ) simulated the formation of galaxies with two gravitationally coupled fluids representing dark matter halo and baryon matter , which is similar in essence to the approximation adopted in our semi - analytical model for clusters of galaxies but on much larger scales .",
    "various self - similar solutions describing hydrodynamic processes of a single self - gravitational isothermal or polytropic gas under spherical symmetry have been investigated previously in contexts of star formation ( e.g. , larson 1969a ; larson 1969b ; shu 1977 ; hunter 1977 ; shu et al .",
    "1987 ; lou & shen 2004 ) . very recently ,",
    "asymptotic behaviours of novel quasi - static solutions in a single polytropic gas sphere with self - gravity have been reported by lou & wang ( 2006 , 2007 ) and was utilized to model rebound ( mhd ) shocks in supernovae ( wang & lou 2007 ) . for an astrophysical system of two fluids coupled by gravity",
    ", we can systematically extend these self - similar solutions , especially the new quasi - static solution , which may be used to describe behaviours of hot icm and dark matter halo in clusters of galaxies . except for the gravitational effect in the newtonian sense , nothing else is known about dark matter particles at present . using the coupled two - fluid model , we might be able to learn physical properties of dark matter halo through detectable diagnostics of hot icm and of gravitational lensing effects .    for clusters of galaxies , there is an outstanding problem of ` missing baryons ' .",
    "extensive x - ray observations have indicated that the baryon mass fraction in clusters of galaxies is typically less than the prediction of primordial nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , ettori & fabian 1999 ; ettori 2003 ; he et al .",
    "2005 ; mcgaugh 2007 ) .",
    "this discrepancy becomes more difficult to reconcile in the cores of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , sand et al .",
    "the best fit of cosmological parameters with tiny temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and large - scale structure clustering shows that relative to the critical mass density @xmath4 in the universe , the mass density of baryon matter is @xmath5 and the total matter density is @xmath6 , where parameter @xmath7 is related to the hubble constant @xmath8 by @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the mean cosmic baryon mass fraction is @xmath11 ( e.g. , he et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) . while there are different methods in determining the @xmath12 value , the cosmic baryon fraction @xmath12 is around 0.17 ( e.g. , mcgaugh 2007 ) .",
    "however in clusters of galaxies , the average gas ( baryon ) fraction inferred by two methods are about @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( e.g. , ettori 2003 ) .",
    "others estimated that the baryon fraction @xmath12 observed in clusters of galaxies can be lower than the cosmic baryon fraction by about @xmath15 at @xmath16 ( e.g. , he et al .",
    "some even claimed that the value of @xmath12 can be lowered by as much as 30% ( e.g. , ettori 2003 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the baryon fraction in most clusters of galaxies are systematically lower than the average cosmic value @xmath12 except those highest estimates for gas ( baryon ) mass fraction in some clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , a426 , a2142 , rxj1350 ; see ettori 2003 ) . to resolve this important issue ,",
    "the notion of warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) has been introduced ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 , 2006 ; ettori 2003 ) . in their opinion , the whim may actually exist within clusters of galaxies to account for the mass of ` missing baryons ' , yet the whim can not be detected at present because it does not emit x - rays .",
    "these results show that a significant fraction ( @xmath17 ) of the baryon component might be found in the form of whim in the temperature range of @xmath18 k ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 2006 ) .",
    "as will be discussed in more details , this problem of ` missing baryons ' in our model scenario is a natural consequence of galaxy cluster winds , be it sustained or sporadic or be it stationary or dynamic during the evolution of galaxy clusters .",
    "these so - called ` missing baryons ' are blown away in the form of hot icm and cool down gradually with time ; with relatively low temperatures , they should mostly reside in the periphery of galaxy clusters and spread out in space on much larger scales .",
    "meanwhile , the dark matter halo may contract within clusters of galaxies in our model .",
    "therefore the mass fraction of baryons @xmath12 ( i.e. , the mass ratio of total baryons to the total gravitational mass inferred ) would be lower than the initial value when a cluster of galaxies was born and started to evolve .",
    "the age of galaxy clusters is estimated to fall in the range of @xmath19 yr ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "as galaxy cluster winds may have existed since galaxy clusters were born , the timescale of galaxy cluster winds would be comparable to or somewhat less than this estimate . in section 3 , we show a few specific examples of numerical shock flow solutions in our model and estimate the loss of baryons within a timescale of @xmath20 yr . as different behaviours of temperature profiles have been inferred from x - ray observations of galaxy clusters ( markevitch 1996 and markevitch et al .",

    "2005b ) , we shall take the specific entropy conservation along streamlines as the equation of state and see how well this may account for the various observed profiles of thermodynamic variables . by properly choosing model parameters in various regimes",
    ", we can describe properties of galaxy clusters to a considerable extent .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the background and motivation of our model development is introduced in section 1 .",
    "section 2 presents in order the basic formulation for the two - fluid model of spherical symmetry involving two polytropic fluids , self - similar transformation , asymptotic solutions at small and large @xmath21 , singular surfaces and sonic critical curves , and shock conditions . in section 3 , we show numerical examples of quasi - static solutions for three different situations .",
    "the major results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "finally we discuss our model results and numerical solutions in section 5 .",
    "certain mathematical details are contained in appendices a through g for the convenience of reference .",
    "as theoretical idealization and simplification , a cluster of galaxies is approximated as fully relaxed or virialized and usually modelled as a static equilibrium system in radial force balance with spherical symmetry .",
    "however , large - scale shock features as observed in clusters of galaxies reveal the presence of large - scale flows , although these implied large - scale flows may not be directly measurable at this stage .",
    "our main motivation of this model analysis is to provide a class of dynamic ( rather than static or stationary ) models for clusters of galaxies with spherical symmetry .",
    "we hope to understand a few basic aspects of this dynamic model framework .",
    "we have several plausible processes in mind .",
    "first , the formation of clusters of galaxies through large - scale gravitational collapse involving dark matter and baryon matter .",
    "secondly , activities of a central agn ( involving accretions of baryon matter as well as dark matter ; e.g. , hu et al . 2004 ) onto supermassive black holes may give rise to a quasi - spherically symmetric component of disturbances on large scales which can evolve into shocks .",
    "thirdly , merging processes may reach a later phase of core confinement such that a large - scale quasi - spherical symmetry may be a sensible approximation ; while releasing energy , it takes time for such a dynamic system to relax and adjust itself .",
    "to study dynamic behaviours of visible baryon matter ( such as x - ray and radio emissions from the hot icm ) under the joint gravity of both massive dark matter and baryon matter together , we adopt three assumptions for the dark matter halo .",
    "first , self - interacting dark matter particle models have been proposed earlier by some researchers ( e.g. , carlson et al .",
    "1992 ; machacek 1994 ; spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) to solve the problems encountered by cold dark matter models .",
    "furthermore , properties of collisional dark matter particles ( e.g. , ostriker 2000 ; hu & lou 2007 ) and fluid dark matter ( e.g. , peebles 2000 ; subramanian 2000 ; moore et al . 2000 ; hennawi & ostriker 2002 ; lou 2005 ; hu et al .",
    "2006 ) were proposed as an alternative approach to probe dm dynamics . on large scales ,",
    "one may view high velocity dispersions ( @xmath22 ) of dm particles to produce an effective pressure against gravity as described by the jeans equation ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "in particular , evrard et al . (",
    "1994 ) numerically simulated formation of galaxies using a model consisting of two gravitationally coupled fluids representing dark matter and baryon matter .",
    "while a distribution function approach can be applied to study properties of galaxy clusters , we model a dark matter halo in a ` fluid ' approximation to simplify the mathematical treatment . on large scales and without resonances",
    ", we should be able to understand various dynamic behaviours of hot intracluster medium ( icm ) and the dark matter halo in this two - fluid approximation ( lou 2005 ) .",
    "secondly , we assume the two - fluid system of galaxy clusters to be spherically symmetric with a common centre and without rotation for simplicity . on much smaller scales",
    ", this simplification would be a very good approximation for globular clusters containing millions of stars and gas .",
    "thirdly , dark matter interacts with hot icm only through gravity .",
    "based on the above assumptions , we readily write out a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations to describe the two - fluid flow system with hot icm and dark matter halo coupled by gravity . in spherical polar",
    "coordinates @xmath23 , the equation for mass conservation is described by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is radius and @xmath26 is time ; subscripts @xmath27 stand for dark matter halo ( fluid @xmath28 ) and hot icm ( fluid @xmath29 ) , respectively . for simplicity , all variables with a subscript @xmath30 denote associations with fluid @xmath30 . when referring to a specific fluid @xmath30 , we would write out subscripts @xmath28 or @xmath29 explicitly . here ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are respectively the enclosed mass , the mass density , and the radial flow speed at radius @xmath25 and time @xmath26 for fluid @xmath30 .",
    "another familiar form equivalent to the above continuity equation ( [ eq01 ] ) is @xmath34 the euler radial momentum equation is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pressure at radius @xmath25 and time @xmath26 for fluid @xmath30 ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the enclosed masses of fluid @xmath28 and fluid @xmath29 , respectively ; @xmath39 is the gravitational constant .",
    "; it should be @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 . ]",
    "the coupling effect of the two fluids is explicitly contained in the gravity term in equation ( [ eqforce ] ) .",
    "finally , we take the conservation equation of specific ` entropy ' along streamlines as the equation of state ( e.g. , fatuzzo et al . 2004 ; wang & lou 2007 ; lou & cao 2007 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the polytropic index for fluid @xmath30 . in general , polytropic indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 are allowed to be different .",
    "equations @xmath46 form a set of nonlinear partial differential equations and contain an important subset of nonlinear self - similar solutions with or without shocks .",
    "we now introduce a set of self - similar transformation for the two polytropic fluids ( e.g. , suto & silk 1988 ; lou & wang 2006 ) below @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the independent dimensionless similarity variable for fluid @xmath30 ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 are actually related to each other ) ; @xmath51 is a scale parameter of self - similar transformation for fluid @xmath30 ; @xmath52 is another index parameter of self - similar transformation for fluid @xmath30 noted above ; @xmath53 is the reduced mass density for fluid @xmath30 ; @xmath54 is the reduced radial flow speed for fluid @xmath30 ; @xmath55 is the reduced pressure for fluid @xmath30 ; and @xmath56 is the reduced enclosed mass for fluid @xmath30 .",
    "all these reduced variables are functions of independent variable @xmath48 only . in principle",
    ", parameter @xmath57 does not need to be equal @xmath58 .",
    "but equation ( [ eqforce ] ) contains factors like @xmath59 and @xmath60 at the same time after the self - similar transformation . therefore in order to obtain the self - similar dimensionless ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in terms of @xmath48 without involving explicit temporal factors of time @xmath26 , we simply require @xmath61 as a single parameter and shall not distinguish the two from now on .",
    "with the specific entropy conservation ( [ state ] ) along streamlines , it is not necessary to require @xmath62 here ( e.g. , yahil 1983 ; suto & silk 1988 ; lou & wang 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "in fact with @xmath63 , we shall explore three possible situations of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "we note that self - similar processes of galaxy cluster evolution and of cooling waves in galaxy clusters have also been studied previously ( e.g. , bertschinger 1989 ; jain & bertschinger 1996 ) . here , cooling waves refer to a self - similar expansion of cooling flow region .",
    "while the cooling region expands , the hot icm itself does not move out .    by performing self - similar transformation ( [ transformation ] )",
    ", the reduced enclosed mass @xmath56 can be expressed as ( e.g. , suto & silk 1988 ; lou & wang 2006 ; lou & cao 2007 ) @xmath67 since the enclosed mass @xmath68 , we should require @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 , while for @xmath72 , we require @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; the latter is generally impossible for semi - complete solutions in the range of @xmath75 . using equation ( [ mass ] ) and self - similar transformation ( [ transformation ] ) , specific entropy conservation ( [ state ] ) along streamlines leads to @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a naturally emerged index parameter and @xmath78 is an integration constant for each fluid @xmath30 . for @xmath79 , we can always effectively combine the two coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath51 into a new single constant coefficient , corresponding to a coefficient rescaling in self - similar transformation ( [ transformation ] ) . the case of a single fluid with @xmath80",
    "is separately considered by lou & cao ( 2007 ; see also goldreich & weber 1980 and yahil 1983 ) .",
    "it then suffices to consider the equation of state in the form of @xmath81 for fluid @xmath30 with coefficients @xmath78 being absorbed without loss of generality .",
    "apparently , there are two linearly related independent variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively for the two coupled fluids under consideration .",
    "we introduce a convenient ratio @xmath82 such that @xmath83 .",
    "we can then express all dependent variables as functions of @xmath49 only .",
    "from now on , we shall rewrite @xmath49 as @xmath21 for simplicity and thus @xmath84 .",

    "we indicate these different paths of reduction below to test and confirm the robustness of our approach .    for @xmath65 and @xmath102 , the formulation here reduces to a spherical composite system of two isothermal fluids coupled by gravity as explored by lou ( 2005 ) .",
    "static and dynamic models may be constructed in that relatively simple theoretical framework in contexts of clusters of galaxies or of globular clusters but on much smaller scales .    by setting physical variables of one of the two fluids to vanish",

    "first , we have ignored the magnetic field permeated in the hot icm which has been observationally inferred to range from a few @xmath333 g to several tens of @xmath333 g in the central region ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ; carilli & taylor 2002 ; hu & lou 2004 ) .",
    "cluster magnetic field can affect the gas dynamics in a nontrivial manner and can provide valuable diagnostic information such as synchrotron emission and modified sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( e.g. , hu & lou 2004 ; bagchi et al .",
    "2006 ) . to better understand behaviours of a magnetized hot gas and dark matter coupled by gravity , a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd )",
    "approach may be adopted ( e.g. , lou & wang 2007 ; wang & lou 2007 ) .",
    "secondly , we have assumed the flow system to be spherically symmetric , which is a highly idealized situation .",
    "various instabilities may arise in dynamic flows to destroy spherical symmetry ( lou & bai , 2007 in preparation ) . for systems of merging galaxies or galaxy clusters , spherical symmetry",
    "is only a gross approximation .",
    "thirdly , our current model requires that the mass density profile has the same form of power law scalings either at small or large radii .",
    "if the scaling parameter @xmath202 can be adjusted in some proper way across a shock , this model may be adapted to simulate more diverse kinds of galaxy clusters . finally , it is possible to take a distribution function approach for dark matter halo and fluid description for the hot icm to model a galaxy cluster as a further development . admittedly , this approach could be mathematically challenging .",
    "compared with previous results , we note a few points regarding our model .",
    "first , our dynamic model of galaxy cluster wind differs from that of yahil & ostriker ( 1973 ) .",
    "they considered a steady - state wind while the galaxy cluster wind of our model is dynamic and self - similar .",
    "their gravitational potential is static and they did not model shock features occurred in galaxy clusters .",
    "secondly , the case of @xmath65 for a single fluid sphere was discussed in suto & silk ( 1988 ) .",
    "in addition to the major difference of two fluids coupled by gravity , our model with @xmath65 differs from that of suto & silk ( 1988 ) in that we have specific entropy conservation along streamlines . in lou ( 2005 ) , the model of two isothermal fluids coupled by gravity is discussed . here ,",
    "we treat two polytropic fluids coupled by self - gravity in more general situations . in particular",
    ", the quasi - static solution does not exist in an isothermal fluid ( lou & wang 2006 ) . by choosing different values of parameters @xmath202 , @xmath43 , and @xmath109 and shock positions ,",
    "our polytropic model can be adapted to various astrophysical systems , including clusters of galaxies and globular clusters on much smaller scales .    due to possible galaxy cluster winds , baryons in galaxy clusters",
    "can flow out of galaxy clusters and stay in their periphery .",
    "meanwhile , dark matter halo contracts under gravity .",
    "as time goes on , such baryon gas cools down and may not be detectable in x - ray bands .",
    "this may naturally explain the problem of ` missing baryons ' for clusters of galaxies .",
    "with this scenario in mind , we should develop observational diagnostics to look for signatures of these missing baryons around clusters of galaxies on much larger spatial scales ( @xmath334 mpcs ) . in our perspective",
    ", the giant radio arcs recently discovered at 1.4ghz in galaxy cluster abell 3376 ( bagchi et al .",
    "2006 ) and the strikingly similar radio arcs in galaxy cluster 3667 ( e.g. , rottgering et al . 1997 ; roettiger et al .",
    "1999 ) are most likely large - scale magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks and imply large - scale flows around clusters of galaxies ( lou & jiang 2008 in preparation ) .    as mentioned earlier , agn activities",
    "are directly observed through intense electromagnetic radiation from normal matter . for agn activities in the central region of a galaxy cluster , accretion of dark matter onto a smbh may be involved ( e.g. , hu et al .",
    "2006 ) although dark matter activities can not be directly detected . in this scenario ,",
    "both icm and dark matter coupled by gravity are active components of agn activities and violent relaxation occurs in highly disturbed dark matter halo ( lynden - bell 1967 ) . in this sense , a dark matter halo gains gravitational energy and ` thermal ' energy with higher velocity dispersions .",
    "furthermore , shocks can also form in association with cluster merging processes also observed to occur in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , the galaxy cluster 1e 0657 - 56 ; clowe et al .",
    "in such merging processes , dark matter is dragged along and the energy may be transferred to the dark matter .",
    "this mechanism has already been discussed by some authors ( e.g. , shchekinov & vasiliev 2006 ; knebe et al .",
    "very recently , caustics in dark matter halo have been discussed by many authors ( e.g. , natarajan & sikivie 2007 ; onemli & sikivie 2007 ; mohayaee et al . 2007 )",
    "caustics are consequence of collisionless cold dark matter in galactic halos or clusters of galaxies .",
    "caustics are regions of infinite density in the limit that the dm particles have zero velocity dispersion ( e.g. , natarajan & sikivie 2007 ) .",
    "gravitational lensing effects have been proposed to detect the existence of such caustics ( e.g. , onemli & sikivie 2007 ) .",
    "compared with sharp drops of dm density in caustics , shocks in dark matter halo of our model are different in that the discontinuity of dm density across shocks is less drastic . in general , the density on the downstream side of shocks are @xmath335 times of the density on the upstream side of shocks .",
    "however , dm shocks share certain common features with dm caustics .",
    "they are both discontinuous surfaces in dark matter halo and both may be detected through gravitational lensing effects at least in principle .",

    "<S> a theoretical model framework of spherical symmetry is presented for a composite astrophysical system of two polytropic fluids coupled together by gravity to explore large - scale shocks and flow dynamics in clusters of galaxies or in globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such large - scale shocks in clusters of galaxies as inferred by high - resolution x - ray and radio imaging observations implies large - scale systematic flows that are beyond usual static models for clusters of galaxies . here </S>",
    "<S> , we explore self - similar two - fluid flow solutions with shocks for a hot polytropic gas flow in a cluster of galaxies in the presence of a massive dark matter ( dm ) flow after the initiation of a gravitational core collapse or a central agn activity or a large - scale merging process . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the possibility of dm shocks or sharp jumps of mass density and of velocity dispersion in dark matter halo is discussed and such dm shocks might be detectable through gravitational lensing effects . to examine various plausible scenarios for clusters of galaxies , we describe three possible classes of shock flows within our model framework for different types of temperature , density and flow speed profiles . depending upon sensible model parameters and shock locations , </S>",
    "<S> the hot icm and dm halo may have various combinations of asymptotic behaviours of outflow , breeze , inflow , contraction or static envelopes at large radii at a given time . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to asymptotic outflows of hot icm at large radii as the _ galaxy cluster wind_. as a result of such galaxy cluster winds and simultaneous contractions of dm halo during the course of galaxy cluster evolution , there would be less hot icm within clusters of galaxies as compared to the average baryon fraction in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> physically , it is then expected that such ` missing baryons ' with lower temperatures reside in the periphery of galaxy clusters on much larger scales . based on our model analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we also predict a limiting ( the steepest ) radial scaling form for mass density profiles of @xmath0 within clusters of galaxies .    </S>",
