    "the main subject of this paper is directed strongly regular graph ( briefly dsrg ) , a possible generalisation of the well - known ( undirected ) strongly regular graphs for the directed case introduced by duval in @xcite .",
    "the undirected version plays a central role in algebraic graph theory , while the directed version received less attention .",
    "we show how to construct larger dsrgs from smaller ones with the aid of suitably defined equitable partitions for directed graphs . according to our best knowledge ,",
    "equitable partitions for directed graphs have not been defined in exact terms , though similar concept can be found for association schemes in @xcite with an application for ( undirected ) strongly regular graphs in @xcite .",
    "the main results of the introduced idea involve constructions of many infinite families of dsrgs .",
    "several families have new parameter sets , others generalise and connect constructions which have been previously known from various ideas .    for the small parameter sets there is an evidence of the current state - of - the - art on the webpage of a.brouwer and s.hobart ( see @xcite ) .",
    "according to their catalogue of parameter sets with order at most 110 , we have confirmed the existence of dsrgs for 30 open parameter sets .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 the necessary and most significant terms are repeated . in section 3 a brief summary",
    "is given on the used computer algebra packages . in section 4 we define a new construction called @xmath0-join .",
    "it serves as a key concept for our project .",
    "we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions , when this construction gives us a dsrg if the basic graph is a smaller dsrg .",
    "it turns out that the crucial moment is finding a certain partition in the basic graph . in section 5",
    "we present good partitions for several well - known families of dsrgs and in section 6 for dsrgs with some sporadic parameter sets .",
    "in this section we present the basic and most significant concepts used in this paper .",
    "all graphs considered in this paper are finite , simple , directed or undirected graphs , thus no loops or multiple edges are allowed .",
    "if there is a dart from vertex @xmath1 to vertex @xmath2 in a directed graph ( digraph ) , then we say that @xmath2 is an _ outneighbour _ of @xmath1 , and @xmath1 is an _ inneighbour _ of @xmath2 .",
    "the number of outneighbours ( inneighbours ) of a vertex @xmath1 is called _ outdegree ( indegree ) _ of @xmath1 .",
    "if the in- and outdegrees of all vertices in a digraph are equal to @xmath3 , then we say that the digraph is _",
    "@xmath3-regular _ , or _",
    "regular of degree ( valency ) @xmath3_.    let @xmath4 be a group .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the identity element of the group @xmath4 .",
    "then the digraph @xmath8 with vertex set @xmath4 and dart set @xmath9 is called the _ cayley digraph over @xmath4 with respect to  @xmath10 .",
    "_    let @xmath11 be a simple undirected graph .",
    "assume that @xmath12 is a partition of @xmath13 .",
    "it is called _ equitable _ if for all @xmath14 the amount of neighbours of a vertex @xmath15 in the set @xmath16 is equal to a constant @xmath17 which does not depend on the choice of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , to an equitable partition we can associate a matrix @xmath18 which is called _ quotient matrix_. an equitable partition @xmath0 is called _ homogeneous of degree @xmath19 _ , if each cell has size @xmath19 .",
    "equitable partitions of graphs can be defined also using their adjacency matrix .",
    "we say that a partition @xmath0 of a matrix @xmath20 is _ column equitable _ , if there exists such an @xmath21 matrix @xmath22 , usually called _ quotient matrix _ , for which @xmath23 , where @xmath4 is an @xmath24 matrix , the _ characteristic matrix _ of @xmath0 , whose columns are the characteristic vectors of @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath25    similarly , a partition @xmath0 of a matrix @xmath20 is _ row equitable _ , if @xmath0 is column equitable for @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath0 is both row and column equitable for an adjacency matrix @xmath20 , then @xmath0 defines an equitable partition of the corresponding graph .",
    "following this idea one can define a kind of equitable partitions also for directed graphs .",
    "we will say that @xmath0 is a _ column equitable partition _ of a directed graph @xmath27 , if it is a column equitable partition of its adjacency matrix @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath20 be an adjacency matrix of a ( di)graph @xmath27 of order @xmath29 , and @xmath0 a partition of @xmath30 into @xmath31 cells @xmath32 .",
    "we say that adjacency matrix @xmath20 _ respects _ the partition @xmath0 , if the corresponding ordering @xmath33 of the vertices satisfies : @xmath34 for all vertices @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the terms like _ adjacency matrix _ , _ kronecker product of matrices _ , _ group of automorphisms of a graph _ , _",
    "1-factor ( perfect matching ) _ , _ clique , coclique _ and _ line graphs_. otherwise , we refer the reader to @xcite",
    ".    we will use also terms like _ blocks of imprimitivity , rank of a permutation group _ or _ transitivity _ from permutation group theory .",
    "for definitions see @xcite .",
    "an undirected graph @xmath27 is called _ regular _ of valency @xmath3 , or _",
    "@xmath3-regular _ , if each vertex is incident to the same number @xmath3 of edges . in the terms of adjacency matrix of a graph",
    "we can equivalently say that @xmath27 is @xmath3-regular if and only if for its adjacency matrix @xmath37 the equation @xmath38 holds , where @xmath39 is the all - one matrix . a simple regular graph with valency @xmath3 is said to be _ strongly regular _",
    "( srg , for short ) if there exist integers @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that for each edge @xmath42 the number of common neighbours of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is exactly @xmath40 ; while for each non - edge @xmath42 the number of common neighbours of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "previous condition can be equivalently rewritten into the equation @xmath45 using the adjacency matrix of @xmath27 . the quadruple @xmath46 is called the _ parameter set _ of an srg @xmath27 .",
    "strongly regular graphs play a central importance in algebraic graph theory .",
    "there are many dozens of papers with interesting constructions and results .",
    "the most significant ones altogether with crucial information on their properties are collected on the webpage of a. brouwer  @xcite .",
    "a database of small srgs is located on the webpage of e. spence  @xcite .",
    "a possible generalisation of the notion of srgs for directed graphs was given by duval  @xcite .",
    "while the family of srgs has been well - studied , the directed version has received less attention .",
    "a _ directed strongly regular graph _ ( dsrg ) with parameters @xmath47 is a regular directed graph on @xmath29 vertices with valency @xmath3 , such that every vertex is incident with  @xmath48 undirected edges , and the number of directed paths of length 2 directed from a vertex @xmath1 to another vertex @xmath2 is @xmath40 , if there is an arc from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and @xmath41 otherwise . in particular ,",
    "a dsrg with @xmath49 is an srg , and a dsrg with @xmath50 is a doubly regular tournament .",
    "* in this paper we prefer to use the ordering @xmath47 for the 5-tuple of parameters of a dsrg , however in several other papers the ordering @xmath51 is used .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath37 of a dsrg with parameters @xmath47 , satisfies    @xmath52    oppositely , if an @xmath53 zero - one matrix @xmath20 with zeros on the diagonal satisfies ( [ am ] ) for some @xmath54 and @xmath41 , then it is an adjacency matrix of a dsrg with parameters @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a dsrg with parameter set @xmath47 and adjacency matrix @xmath20 , then the complementary graph @xmath55 is a dsrg with parameter set @xmath56 with adjacency matrix @xmath57 , where @xmath58 [ prop2 ]    for a directed graph @xmath27 let @xmath59 denote the digraph obtained by reversing all the darts in @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath59 is called the _",
    "reverse _ of @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath20 is the adjacency matrix of  @xmath27 , then @xmath26 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath59 .",
    "the following proposition was observed by pech , and presented in @xcite :    let @xmath27 be a dsrg .",
    "then the graph @xmath59 is a dsrg with the same parameter set .",
    "[ prop1 ]    we say that two dsrgs @xmath60 and @xmath61 are _ equivalent _ , if @xmath62 , or @xmath63 , or @xmath64 , or @xmath65 ; otherwise they are called _ non - equivalent_. ( in other words , @xmath60 is equivalent to @xmath61 if and only if @xmath60 is isomorphic to @xmath61 or to a graph , obtained from @xmath61 via reverse and complementation . ) from our point of view the interesting dsrgs are those which are non - equivalent .    under _ eigenvalues _ of a dsrg we mean the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix .",
    "it is known , that there are precisely three different eigenvalues , all of them are integers , and their values together with their multiplicities are uniquely determined by the parameter set .",
    "more explicitly , a dsrg with parameter set @xmath47 has eigenvalues :    @xmath66 with respective multiplicities : @xmath67    the parameters @xmath68 are not independent .",
    "relations , which have to be satisfied for such parameter sets are usually called _",
    "feasibility conditions_. most important , and , in a sense , basic conditions are the following ( for their proof see @xcite ) :    @xmath69    there exists a positive integer @xmath19 such that : @xmath70    further : @xmath71    we have to mention that for a feasible parameter set it is not guaranteed that a dsrg does exist . a feasible parameter set for which at least one dsrg @xmath27 exists is called _ realizable _ , otherwise _ non - realizable_. the smallest example of a feasible , but non - realizable parameter set is @xmath72 .",
    "the non - existence of such graph was shown in @xcite .",
    "there are known several general constructions of dsrgs .",
    "the most common constructions are based on algebraic or combinatorial approaches , or even on their combination .",
    "they include approaches using block matrices @xcite , kronecker product of matrices @xcite , finite geometries @xcite , combinatorial block designs @xcite , finite incidence structures @xcite , coherent algebras @xcite , association schemes @xcite , regular tournaments @xcite , partial sum families @xcite , cayley graphs @xcite or computer algebra experimentation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this list by a construction which is on the border of matrix construction , equitable partitions and computer algebra experimentation .",
    "this project has been supported by an essential amount of results which have been obtained with the aid of a computer .",
    "all such computations have been run in gap ( groups , algorithms , programming @xcite ) jointly with using its share packages : grape  a package for computation with graphs @xcite together with nauty for testing automorphisms of graphs @xcite ; coco ii  an unreleased package for computation with coherent configurations and association schemes , written by reichard @xcite ; and the package setorbit for finding representatives of orbits of group actions on sets of various size , written by pech and reichard @xcite .",
    "in this section we introduce a new construction , which serves as a basic idea for constructing new graphs from old ones .",
    "we will investigate when this construction gives us a larger dsrg from smaller ones and derive its most important properties . starting from this section",
    "it often happens that we do not need to distinguish between directed and undirected strongly regular graphs . in such a case we use abbreviation ( d)srg .",
    "let us consider a directed or an undirected strongly regular graph @xmath27 of order @xmath29 .",
    "let us call it _",
    "basic graph_. suppose that @xmath73 is a homogeneous partition of its vertex set into @xmath31 cells of size @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . consider a positive integer @xmath76 and define a digraph @xmath77 as following .",
    "create @xmath78 disjoint copies @xmath79 of the graph @xmath27 , i.e. for its vertex set we have @xmath80 in each of the copies we can distinguish the images of the cells of the partition @xmath0 .",
    "let us denote @xmath81 the image of the cell @xmath82 in the @xmath83-th copy of @xmath27 .",
    "we define the adjacency in @xmath77 between vertices by giving the set of outneighbours of vertices . for fixed @xmath83",
    "there is a dart from vertex @xmath84 to vertex @xmath85 whenever there is a dart from @xmath43 to @xmath44 in @xmath27 .",
    "further , let @xmath86 for some @xmath87 and @xmath83 .",
    "there is a dart from @xmath84 to all of the vertices in cells @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where the superscripts are taken modulo @xmath90 .",
    "let us call this construction _",
    "@xmath0-join of @xmath27 in power @xmath76 , _ or just shortly _ @xmath0-join _ when @xmath27 and/or @xmath76 are either clear from the context or irrelevant .    according to our best knowledge",
    "this construction is new .",
    "however , it can be regarded as a mixture of the lexicographic product of graphs @xcite and the x - join of graphs @xcite . in particular , if @xmath91 then our construction coincides with the lexicographic product of @xmath27 with the complete graph @xmath92 .",
    "the similarity with x - joins can be seen after collapsing each cell in @xmath77 into a single vertex . from this",
    "follows that the only difference between our construction and x - join is , that we define differently adjacencies between vertices in the cells which do belong to the same copy of @xmath27 , and those which do not .",
    "now , we translate the @xmath0-join construction into the language of matrices , since it will be easier to prove statements using adjacency matrices of graphs .",
    "let @xmath27 be a ( di)graph and @xmath73 be a homogeneous partition of its vertices into @xmath31 cells of size @xmath74 , for suitable positive integers @xmath31 and @xmath74 .",
    "reorder the vertices of @xmath27 according to @xmath0 and create adjacency matrix @xmath20 of @xmath27 which respects @xmath0 .",
    "then we may consider @xmath20 as a block matrix with blocks of size @xmath93 .",
    "let us define for @xmath94 matrix @xmath95 as a matrix whose all entries are ones in the columns with indices @xmath96 , and all other entries are zeros , i.e. @xmath97 , where @xmath39 is the all - ones matrix of size @xmath98 , and @xmath99 stands for the kronecker product .",
    "further , for an arbitrary integer @xmath76 let us create a circulant block matrix @xmath100 whose first row of blocks is @xmath101 and all other rows of blocks are obtained by shifting the blocks to right by one position .",
    "the matrix @xmath100 is the adjacency matrix of the @xmath0-join of @xmath27 in power @xmath76 , defined above .    for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    "then we have the following matrices : @xmath105 while for @xmath106 and @xmath107 we have : @xmath108      the motivation behind the @xmath0-join construction defined in the previous subsection comes from an analysis of previously known dsrgs .",
    "it showed that a significant amount of them can be constructed as a @xmath0-join of certain smaller dsrg @xmath27 , its partition @xmath0 and a suitable integer  @xmath76 .",
    "inspired by this observation we started to investigate the following problem :    * problem : * _ for a given ( d)srg @xmath27 , what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a homogeneous partition @xmath0 in order to get a dsrg from the @xmath76-th power of its @xmath0-join ? _    we will solve this problem in two steps .",
    "first , we will consider the smallest case @xmath106 to derive some necessary conditions on @xmath27 and @xmath0 .",
    "after that we will show that if these conditions are satisfied , then for arbitrary integer @xmath76 the @xmath76-th power of the @xmath0-join produces again a dsrg .",
    "if a @xmath0-join of a ( d)srg @xmath27 produces a larger dsrg , then we say that @xmath0 is a _ good partition _ for @xmath27 .",
    "here we derive the necessary conditions for a homogeneous partition @xmath0 in a ( d)srg @xmath27 in order to be good for the @xmath0-join construction .",
    "let us start with an easy observation about matrices @xmath95 .",
    "computational arguments lead to the following properties :    * observation 1 : * let @xmath109 are as in the definition of the @xmath0-join construction .",

    "in similar manner one can show that from duval s generalized construction ( @xcite , theorem 8.3 ) , in conjunction with our construction it is possible to obtain dsrgs with parameter sets    @xmath186 @xmath187 for arbitrary positive integers @xmath188 .      for any positive integers @xmath3 and @xmath41 such that @xmath189 , jrgensen in @xcite constructed a dsrg @xmath27 with parameter set @xmath190 .",

    "if we consider the only imprimitivity system of the group of automorphisms with blocks of size 6 , then after some experimentation we can obtain 3 pairs of blocks whose unions results in a 3-cell partition with cells of size 12 and quotient matrix @xmath450 .",
    "this proves the existence of a dsrg with parameter set @xmath451 for arbitrary positive integer @xmath76 .",
    "it is known that the exact number of srg sharing the parameter set ( 36,15,6,6 ) is 32548 ( for more information see @xcite ) .",
    "we considered a highly symmetric one of them with automorphism group of order 648 .",
    "( in the catalogue of e. spence it is the last graph on this parameter set . )",
    "it has a unique system of imprimitivity with blocks of size 9 .",
    "union of any two of these blocks and the remaining two blocks gives us a suitable partition for @xmath442 .",
    "hence , the existence of a dsrg with parameter set @xmath452 is proved for every integer @xmath76 . for @xmath106",
    "the parameter set @xmath453 is new according to @xcite .    in a similar fashion , using unions of 4 blocks of imprimitivity of size 3 we have found a good partition into 3 cells of size 12 , therefore the existence of a dsrg with parameter set @xmath454 is proved for all integer @xmath76 .      just for curiosity we considered one of the most famous srgs , the hoffman - singleton graph .",
    "solutions of are @xmath455 and @xmath456 , however the latter is excluded by .",
    "the first solution challenges us to consider the partition consisting from 5 vertex - disjoint copies of the petersen graph . by counting the possible quotient matrix",
    "it is not hard to see that this is really a good partition , therefore there exists a dsrg @xmath457 for each positive integer @xmath76 .",
    "using our @xmath0-join construction introduced in section [ spi ] we constructed dozens of infinite families of dsrgs from smaller ones . among the constructed graphs with order less than 110",
    "there are 30 with new parameter sets according to @xcite .",
    "the new parameter sets are displayed in the appendix .",
