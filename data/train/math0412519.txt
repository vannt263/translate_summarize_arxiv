    "geometric invariant theory @xcite has been very successful in forming moduli spaces of ( semi)stable coherent sheaves over polarised algebraic varieties @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "moduli space is constructed as a quotient of a subset of a quot scheme by a group , and the hilbert - mumford criterion is applied to 1-parameter subgroups .",
    "their weights are found to be dominated by positive linear combinations of weights of particularly simple 1-parameter subgroups corresponding to a degeneration of a sheaf @xmath4 into a splitting @xmath5 , for some subsheaf @xmath6 .",
    "thus stability of sheaves is governed by subsheaves ; calculating the corresponding weights leads to the notion of slope stability ( the exact form of the slope depending on the linearisation used on quot ) .",
    "forming moduli spaces of ( semi)stable varieties themselves using git has proved much more difficult , and has mainly been accomplished for canonically polarised varieties using the chow linearisation , due to work of mumford @xcite , gieseker @xcite , and , in a little more generality , viehweg @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking one expects varieties polarised by their canonical bundle @xmath7 to be automatically stable since their moduli functor is already separated because of the birational invariance of spaces of sections of powers of the canonical bundle . in the general case no geometric criterion for ( in)stability has emerged .",
    "this is because the hilbert - mumford criterion has not been successfully simplified or interpreted for varieties ; instead viehweg proved deep positivity results to produce the group - invariant sections of the appropriate line bundle directly ( for varieties with semi - ample canonical bundle ) .",
    "kollar @xcite and others have turned to other methods for producing moduli of varieties , but new impetus to understanding stability has come from the link between k - stability and the existence of khler - einstein and constant scalar curvature khler metrics @xcite to which we apply our methods in @xcite .",
    "our approach uses the hilbert - mumford criterion , as pioneered by mumford @xcite .",
    "he calculates the relevant weights in terms of blow - ups of @xmath8 in subschemes supported on thickenings of @xmath9 ; one of our main results ( corollary [ ref ] ) reduces the calculation to a sum of weights of blow - ups _ in the scheme - theoretic central fibre_. ( in a sense which is made clear by the proof the construction turns the horizontal thickenings of mumford  vertical \" , into the central fibre . )",
    "taking just one such blow - up in a subscheme @xmath3 gives the  deformation to the normal cone of @xmath10 \" , analogous to the simple 1-parameter subgroups that arise in the git of sheaves .",
    "this gives a numerical condition for @xmath10 to destabilise @xmath11 , and so a notion of  slope stability \" , by analogy with the sheaf theory which we now review briefly .",
    "for a sheaf @xmath4 over @xmath0 , the _ reduced _ hilbert polynomial @xmath12 is the monic version of the hilbert polynomial @xmath13 : @xmath14 and the _ slope _ of @xmath4 is its leading nontrivial coefficient , @xmath15 ( this differs from the usual definition deg@xmath16 by unimportant terms that depend only on the geometry of @xmath0 . )",
    "then we say that @xmath4 is _ semistable _ if for all proper coherent subsheaves @xmath6 , @xmath17 for _ gieseker semistability _ , @xmath18 means there exists an @xmath19 such that @xmath20 for all @xmath21 ; for _ slope semistability _ the inequality is at the level of the @xmath22 coefficients : @xmath23 if the inequalities are all strict then @xmath4 is _ stable _ , and this agrees with the appropriate git notions for different choices of linearisation ( i.e.choice of equivariant line bundle on the quot scheme ; in fact jun li s line bundle @xcite is only semi - ample , but he extends git to this case . )    due to different choices of linearisation and asymptotics there are also many notions of stability ( hilbert , chow , asymptotic hilbert , asymptotic chow and k - stability ) for varieties , defined in the next section , and so many versions of slope .",
    "we first describe the one relevant to k - stability .    given a subscheme @xmath10 of a polarised algebraic variety @xmath0 , define @xmath24 the hilbert - samuel polynomial for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 defines @xmath27 which are polynomials in @xmath25 ( see section [ k ] ) and so extend by the same formulae to @xmath28 .",
    "then analogously to ( [ mu ] ) we define the _ k - slope _ of @xmath29 ( with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath31 $ ] ) to be @xmath32 setting @xmath33 defines the slope of @xmath11 ( precisely : of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath35 ) as @xmath36 independently of @xmath35 .",

    "the @xmath44  correction term \" in the definition of slope arises from the difference between the hilbert polynomial of a 2-component normal crossing variety and the sum of those of its components ( whereas for sheaves , @xmath45 for any @xmath6 ) .",
    "simon donaldson pointed out that his analysis of stability of toric varieties @xcite throws up a boundary term similar to our @xmath46 ; we explain this in @xcite .    similarly for @xmath47 ( embedded in projective space by the space of sections of its polarisation @xmath48 for ease of exposition ; see section [ sec : chow ] for the general case ) , a subscheme @xmath49 and an _ integer _",
    "@xmath50 , we define the _ chow slope _ of @xmath29 to be @xmath51 setting @xmath33 gives @xmath52 ; then chow ( semi)stability implies chow slope ( semi)stability ( theorem [ thmchow ] ) : @xmath53 asymptotic chow is more like gieseker stability and so our slope criterion for that ( [ chow ] ) is more complicated .",
    "section [ k ] describes the various stability notions uniformly , while section [ kslope ] introduces slope stability via the deformation to the normal cone .",
    "arbitrary 1-parameter subgroups are studied in section [ testconfigs ] , calculating their weights in terms of a sequence of simple blow ups in corollary [ ref ] . in section [ converse ] these weights are shown to be those of a deformation to the normal cone under certain circumstances , giving a partial converse to ",
    "stability @xmath54 slope stability \" .",
    "we used to think this could be done in general , but the failure of the _ thickenings _ of certain flat families of subschemes to themselves be flat prevents us from carrying out the programme in full .",
    "we study when the thickenings _ are _ flat , and get round the problem with a basechange trick in some situations .",
