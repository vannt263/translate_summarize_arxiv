    "hawaii  167  was identified in the hawaii k - band survey ( songalia et al .",
    "1994 ) . displaying a rest - frame ultraviolet spectrum of a young stellar population at z=2.34 ,",
    "hawaii  167  also possesses broad absorption troughs of both high and low ionized species , consistent with the presence of bulk outflows ( cowie et al .",
    "while such features are characteristic of the broad absorption line ( bal ) class of quasars , the broad emission lines indicative of an agn core are not seen in the ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "infrared spectroscopy , however , does reveal both broad @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( cowie et al .",
    "1994 ; egami et al .",
    "1996 ) , with a redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "these observations indicate a substantial balmer - decrement ( hall et al .",
    "1997 ) , suggesting that hawaii  167   is an example of a dust enshrouded quasar ; thought to represent an early evolutionary stage , such systems would appear as fully fledged quasars once all the dust has been removed . during the transition from one phase to another , as dust is blown from a central obscuring torus , the system will appear as a bal - type quasar .",
    "it appears , therefore , that hawaii  167   provides us with a view of an embryonic quasar .",
    "the limited data available on hawaii  167 , however , means that an accurate determination of dust mass , total luminosity and its true evolutionary status is not currently possible .",
    "in this paper we present submillimetre observations of hawaii  167 , probing the emission from a dusty component .",
    "these were obtained as part of a survey of the dust properties of bal quasars ( lewis & chapman 2000 in preparation ) . in section  [ observations ] the details of the observations",
    "are presented , while section  [ discussion ] discusses the dust content and evolutionary status of hawaii  167 .",
    "the conclusions to this study are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we observed hawaii  167  with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope   on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we used the photometry three bolometer chopping mode described in chapman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and scott et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to keep the source in a bolometer throughout the observation .",
    "this mode has the additional advantage of allowing a check on the apparent detection of a source over three independent bolometers .",
    "the observations were taken in may 2000 , using the 450@xmath3 m and 850@xmath3 m arrays simultaneously .",
    "the alignment of the 450@xmath3 m and 850@xmath3 m arrays is not perfect , and we did not include the 450@xmath3 m offbeams in our final flux estimate , except to check that the source had offbeam flux consistent with the detection in the primary bolometer .    for our double - difference observations",
    "there are instantaneously @xmath4 beams , with the central beam having an efficiency of unity and the two off beams having @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angular distance of the off - beam centre from the source , and @xmath7 is the gaussian half - width of the beam . for the secondary bolometer",
    "the beam efficiency is simply 0.5 .",
    "however , distortion in the field results in our chosen third bolometer being slightly offset from the source position , resulting in a beam efficiency of 0.44 .",
    "our detection level increases from @xmath8 to 3.7@xmath9 , after folding in the negative flux density from the two offbeam pixels .",
    "the effective integration time on source was 1900ks .",
    "the secondary was chopped at 7.8125hz with a chop throw at 53 arcsec to keep the source on bolometer at all times .",
    "pointing was checked before and after the observation on blazars and a sky - dip was performed to measure the atmospheric opacity directly .",
    "the rms pointing errors were below 2 arcsec , while the average atmospheric zenith opacities at 450@xmath3 m  and 850@xmath3 m  were 1.5 and 0.22 respectively .",
    "the data were reduced using the starlink package surf ( scuba user reduction facility , jenness & lightfoot  1998 ) and our own reduction routines to implement the three bolometer chopping mode .",
    "spikes were first carefully rejected from the data , followed by correction for atmospheric opacity and sky subtraction using the median of all the array pixels , except for obviously bad pixels and the source pixels .",
    "the data were then calibrated against standard planetary and compact region sources , observed during the same night .",
    "the resulting fluxes were 6.04@xmath101.65  mjy at 850@xmath3 m and 66.0@xmath1020.7  mjy at 450@xmath3 m .",
    "figure  [ sed ] presents the extant data of hawaii  167 , including the scuba data discussed in section  [ observations ] .",
    "also included for comparison is the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the z=2.28 ultraluminous infrared galaxy fsc  10214 + 4724  ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1993 ) ; this system is also thought to harbour a dust enshrouded quasar ( e.g. barvainis et al . 1995 ) .",
    "gravitational lensing has significantly boosted the apparent luminosity of fsc  10214 + 4724  ( e.g. by 30@xmath11 in the ir ; broadhurst & lehar 1995 ) , although no correction for magnification has been made to its data points in the figure .",
    "emission from a dusty component can be modeled as a greybody of the form @xmath12 } \\label{benford}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the frequency at which the source becomes optically thick ( benford et al .",
    "1999 ) ; the shape of the greybody is only mildly sensitive to the value of @xmath13 and we adopt the value of @xmath14 ( hughes et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the hawaii  167  data is consistent with a greybody temperature of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; while these values differ from ` typical '",
    "greybody fits to agn , which result in values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( benford et al .",
    "1999 ) , the differences are not significant given the errors .",
    "following the recipe of mcmahon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the 850@xmath3 m flux was use to calculate the following physical properties   assumed throughout@xmath19 ; a far infrared luminosity of @xmath20 and an associated dust mass of @xmath21 ( assuming a dust temperature of 50k ) .",
    "such values place hawaii  167firmly in the ultraluminous class of infrared galaxies ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "if the observed infrared emission were solely due to stars , it would correspond to a star formation rate of @xmath22 ( this is an upper limits as hawaii  167  obviously contains a central agn source which also acts to heat the dust ) .",
    "hawaii  167   displays no evidence of gravitational lensing , appearing point - like at a psf - scale @xmath23 ( cowie et al .",
    "1994 ) , and hence its inferred properties have not been magnified and we can conclude that hawaii  167  is truly an ultraluminous system .    while we have added to the sed of hawaii  167 ,",
    "the data are still sparse and a detailed determination of the underlying physical properties and geometry is unwarranted .",
    "instead , we compare its sed to published models of dust enshrouded quasars . the lines in figure  [ sed ] represent such models for ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( granato , danese & franceseschini 1996 ) . consisting of a optically thick torus of dust , extending over several hundred parsecs from the agn core , each curve represents a differing viewing angle ; the dot - dashed line is an equatorial view which maximally extinguishes the optical - uv light from the quasar , which the treble - dot - dashed line is a polar view with an unobstructed view of the agn core .",
    "the dotted line represents an intermediate case , with a viewing angle of @xmath24 .",
    "a substantial portion of the radiation from the central quasar is reprocessed into submm / ir by dust in the torus .",
    "such models reasonably reproduce the sed characteristics of fsc  10214 + 4724  ( equatorial view ) , as well as other ultraluminous systems such as the cloverleaf quasar , h1413 + 117 ( polar view ) and iras",
    "09104 + 4109 & iras  fsc",
    "15307 + 3252 ( intermediate view ) .",
    "in figure  [ sed ] , these curves have been normalized to the data presented in this paper .",
    "it is important to note that egami et al .",
    "( 1996 ) conclude that the ( rest - frame ) uv emission in hawaii  167  arises solely in a stellar population , with no contribution from the agn core due to complete obscuration by the circumnuclear dust .",
    "as all the models of granato et al .",
    "( 1996 ) predict that _ some _ radiation from the central regions must be visible in the uv , none can accurately describe the sed of hawaii  167 , but this may be due to the parameter set employed in the modeling ; the inclusion of more dust , or changing the opening angle of the torus may bring better agreement between the models and the data .",
    "it is apparent , however , that combining the submillimetre and infrared data favours a model with an intermediate viewing angle on to the obscuring torus .",
    "again , scaling from the models , the resulting dust mass in hawaii  167  is @xmath25 . without more data over the sed of hawaii  167",
    ", this value possesses a significant uncertainty , but does indicate that hawaii  167  harbours a vast quantity of dusty material .",
    "the nature of the broad absorption lines seen in the rest frame uv of hawaii  167  presents an interesting problem . in the ` standard model ' of bal quasars the prominent absorption lines are the result of the central continuum emission",
    "being observed through material which is ablated from an obscuring torus by the action of the central quasar ( e.g. barvainis et al . 1995 ) . in hawaii  167  the uv view of the central quasar",
    "is completely obscured and the agn radiation can not be responsible for accelerating the bal material . a potential solution , however , is that the bal material is driven from the outer dusty regions by hot young stars .",
    "the requirement of two sources for the driving force of the bal material during different stages of the systems evolution does , however , seem a little contrived , but we can currently offer no solution to the problem .      in terms of infrared luminosity , and hence associated dust mass ,",
    "hawaii  167   is similar to other ultraluminous systems ( rowan - robinson 2000 ) , and it is only the detection of broad emission lines in the infrared that directly reveals the presence of a quasar at its core .",
    "such a picture is consistent with their being an evolutionary link between the two populations ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . here",
    ", an initial burst of star formation is triggered by the merger between two gas - rich systems .",
    "the merger channels gas into the central regions of the remnant , forming and feeding an quasar core .",
    "this agn , however , is obscured by dust , the detritus of the star burst ; it is at this stage which we find hawaii  167 .",
    "the dust is ablated from the torus due to radiation from the quasar core , eventually clearing and revealing an ` normal ' quasar .",
    "further clues to the nature and geometry of hawaii  167  will be gleaned from polarization studies . as demonstrated with fsc  10214 + 4724  ( goodrich et al . 1996 ) , such observations can reveal the presence broad emission features , and hence an agn core , the light of which has been scattered from a exterior region ( barvainis et al .",
    "the identification of a scattered view of the central engine will imply that the agn core is not completely obscured .",
    "we have presented new submillimetre photometry of the high redshift , broad absorption line system hawaii  167 .",
    "these observations confirm that this system consists of a quasar which is enshrouded in a massive ( @xmath26 ) quantity of dust . with an inferred infrared luminosity of @xmath27 , hawaii  167",
    "is a member of the ultraluminous class of infrared galaxies .",
    "the more extreme members of this family , namely fsc  10214 + 4724  and h  1413 + 117 , have been found to be gravitational lenses .",
    "hence , their apparent luminosities have been significantly magnified .",
    "considering this , hawaii  167  represents an intrinsically more luminous source than these objects .    the identification of hawaii  167  as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy provides more supporting evidence for there being an evolutionary link between these and the agn family . while presenting us with the rare view of a embryonic quasar in the process of shedding its dusty cocoon , data on hawaii  167   are currently quite sparse and more observations",
    "are required before detailed modeling can be undertaken .",
    "we thank the staff of the jcmt for their assistance with the scuba observations , and the weather for being so cooperative .",
    "gfl thanks the australian nuclear science & technology organization ( ansto ) for financial support .",
