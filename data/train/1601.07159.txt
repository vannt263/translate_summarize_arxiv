    "the fock exchange operator , or simply the exchange operator , plays a central role both in wavefunction theory and in density functional theory , two cornerstones of modern quantum chemistry .",
    "hartree - fock theory ( hf ) is the starting point of nearly all wavefunction based correlation methods .",
    "kohn - sham density functional theory ( ksdft )  @xcite is the most widely used electronic structure theory for molecules and systems in condensed phase .",
    "the accuracy of ksdft is ultimately determined by the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional employed in the calculation . despite the great success of relatively simple xc functionals such as local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite , generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite and meta - gga  @xcite functionals ,",
    "numerous computational studies in the past two decades suggest that ksdft calculations with hybrid functionals  @xcite can provide systematically improved description of important physical quantities such as band gaps , for a vast range of systems . as an example",
    ", the b3lyp functional  @xcite , which is only one specific hybrid functional , has generated more than @xmath0 citations ( data from isi web of science , january , 2016 ) .",
    "hybrid functional calculations are computationally more involved since it contains a fraction of the fock exchange term , which is defined using the entire density matrix rather than the electron density . if the exchange operator is constructed explicitly , the computational cost scales as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of electrons of the system .",
    "the cost can be reduced to @xmath3 by iterative algorithms that avoid the explicit construction of the exchange operator , but with a large preconstant .",
    "hence hybrid functional calculations for systems consisting of hundreds of atoms or even less can be a very challenging computational task .",
    "various numerical methods have been developed to reduce the computational cost of hartree - fock - like calculations ( i.e. hartree - fock calculations and ksdft calculations with hybrid functionals ) , most notably methods with asymptotic `` linear scaling '' complexity  @xcite .",
    "the linear scaling methods use the fact that for an insulating system with a finite homo - lumo gap , the subspace spanned by the occupied orbitals has a compressed representation : it is possible to find a unitary transformation to transform all occupied orbitals into a set of orbitals localized in the real space .",
    "this is closely related to the `` nearsightedness '' of electronic matters  @xcite .",
    "various efforts have been developed to find such localized representation  @xcite .",
    "after such localized representation is obtained , the exchange operator also becomes simplified , leading to more efficient numerical schemes for systems of sufficiently large sizes  @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies indicate that linear scaling methods can be very successful in reducing the cost of the calculation of the exchange term for systems of large sizes with substantial band gaps  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we develop a new method for reducing the computational cost due to the fock exchange operator .",
    "our method aims at finding a low rank decomposition of the exchange operator . however , standard low rank decomposition schemes such as the singular value decomposition mandates the low rank operator to yield similar result as the exchange operator does when applied to an arbitrary orbital .",
    "this is doomed to fail since the exchange operator is not a low rank operator , and forcefully applied low rank decomposition can lead to unphysical results .",
    "the key observation of this work is that in order to compute physical quantities in hartree - fock - like calculations , it is sufficient to construct an operator that yields the same result as the exchange operator does when applied to the _ occupied orbitals_. this is possible since the rank of the subspace spanned by the occupied orbitals is known _ a priori_. since occupied orbitals vary in self - consistent field iterations , the compressed representation must be adaptive to the changing orbitals .",
    "hence our compressed exchange operator is referred to as the adaptively compressed exchange operator ( ace ) .",
    "the ace formulation has a few notable advantages : 1 ) the ace is a strictly low rank operator , and there is no loss of accuracy when used to compute physical quantities such as total energies and band gaps .",
    "2 ) the effectiveness of the ace _ does not _ depend on the size of the band gap .",
    "hence the method is applicable to insulators as well as semiconductors or even metals .",
    "3 ) the construction cost of the ace is similar to the one time application cost of the exchange operator to the set of occupied orbitals .",
    "once constructed , the ace can be repeatedly used .",
    "the cost of applying the ace is similar to that of applying a nonlocal pseudopotential operator , thanks to the low rank structure .",
    "4 ) in an iterative framework for solving the hartree - fock - like equations , the ace formulation only requires moderate change of the code , and could be potentially beneficial for all electronic structure software packages involving exchange calculations .",
    "our numerical results indicate that once the ace is constructed , the cost of each self - consistent field iteration ( scf ) of the electron density in a hybrid functional calculation is only marginally larger than that of a gga calculation .",
    "the ace formulation offers significant speedup even for small systems with tens of atoms in a serial implementation . for moderately larger systems , such as a silicon system with @xmath4 atoms ,",
    "we observe more than @xmath5 times speedup in terms of the cost of each scf iteration for the electron density .",

    "in this section we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ace formulation for accelerating ksdft calculations with hybrid functionals .",

    "the latter two systems correspond to a silicon unit cell with @xmath92 atoms replicated into a @xmath102 and a @xmath103 supercell , respectively .",

    "although the construction of the ace still requires solving a large number of poisson equations , the overall time is greatly reduced since the ace , once constructed , can be used for multiple scfs for converging the electron density , until the orbitals @xmath109 s are changed in the outer iteration . even assuming the inner iteration only consists of one scf iteration , for the system with @xmath4 atoms , the ace formulation already achieves a speedup @xmath110 times compared to the standard implementation .",

    "<S> the fock exchange operator plays a central role in modern quantum chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> the large computational cost associated with the fock exchange operator hinders hartree - fock calculations and kohn - sham density functional theory calculations with hybrid exchange - correlation functionals , even for systems consisting of hundreds of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the adaptively compressed exchange operator ( ace ) formulation , which greatly reduces the computational cost associated with the fock exchange operator without loss of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the ace formulation does not depend on the size of the band gap , and thus can be applied to insulating , semiconducting as well as metallic systems . in an iterative framework for solving hartree - fock - like systems </S>",
    "<S> , the ace formulation only requires moderate modification of the code , and can be potentially beneficial for all electronic structure software packages involving exchange calculations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results indicate that the ace formulation can become advantageous even for small systems with tens of atoms . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the cost of each self - consistent field iteration for the electron density in the ace formulation is only marginally larger than that of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) calculation , and thus offers orders of magnitude speedup for hartree - fock - like calculations . </S>"
