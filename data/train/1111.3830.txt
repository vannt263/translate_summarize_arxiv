    "in 1969 , peter mazur suggested @xcite that _ the time - average _ @xmath2 of a bounded observable @xmath3 can be bounded from below by means of _ exact conservation laws _ , i.e. observables @xmath4 , @xmath5 , satisfying @xmath6 and being mutually in _ involution _ , namely @xmath7 @xmath8 is a thermal average at inverse temperature @xmath9 , and observables @xmath4 have to be chosen to be mutually ` orthogonal ' @xmath10 . considering observables with a vanishing equilibrium expectation @xmath11 , strict positivity of the right - hand side ( rhs ) of mazur inequality ( [ eq : mazursineq ] ) is a convenient indicator of _ non - ergodicity _ of the observable @xmath12 .",
    "mazur has shown that in classical statistical physics , the inequality ( [ eq : mazursineq ] ) is merely a corollary of the khinchin theorem @xcite .",
    "later , suzuki @xcite has proven a quantum version of the bound ( [ eq : mazursineq ] ) , strictly applying only to _",
    "finite _ quantum systems as his proof is based on explicit diagonalization of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "existence of non - trivial constants of motion which is characteristic of _ completely integrable systems _ implies non - ergodicity of ( almost all / generic ) observables , making an intimate connection between non - ergodicity and complete integrability , both in classical and quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : mazursineq ] ) has found numerous and very useful applications in condensed matter physics as it is naturally suited for bounding dynamical susceptibilities within the linear response theory .",
    "for example , within the framework of kubo s linear response approach , the zero - frequency drude peak ( see e.g.@xcite ) is defined in terms of the real part of ( heat / electric / spin ) conductivity @xmath13 .",
    "the constant @xmath14 known as the _ drude weight _ can be expressed . ] for a one - dimensional quantum lattice of size @xmath15 as @xmath16 the symmetrized correlation function is used in order to render drude weight manifestly real . here , in ( [ eq : kubo ] )",
    ", @xmath17 is an extensive ( energy / particle / spin ) current operator , and @xmath18 is a current density at site @xmath19 .",
    "positivity of the drude weight @xmath20 is a signature of a ballistic transport at finite temperature and is generically related to complete integrability via mazur inequality ( [ eq : mazursineq ] ) , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the order of limits in the kubo - type formula ( [ eq : kubo ] ) is crucial , namely taking them in a different order can sometimes produce completely different results ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within suzuki s",
    "approach , _ thermodynamic _ limit ( tl ) of letting the system size @xmath15 , or the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath21 , can only be taken at the end , which is not according to a fundamental principle of statistical mechanics which states that tl @xmath21 has to be always considered before the _ long - time _ limit @xmath22 ( say as in formula ( [ eq : kubo ] ) ) .",
    "our program in this paper is then to use the natural language of quantum statistical mechanics of systems with local interactions  the quasi - local @xmath0-algebras  and to develop an algebraic approach to drude weight bounds of the mazur - type pertaining to strictly infinite quantum lattice systems . in the suzuki s theorem conservation laws",
    "have to strictly commute with the hamiltonian , @xmath23=0 $ ] , for all finite sizes @xmath15 .",
    "for that reason , one has to often study periodic boundary conditions which may only guarantee existence of such exact conserved quantities .",

    "the projection form of the lieb - robinson bound @xcite enables us to nicely separate the causality light - cone of a time - evolved observable in the autocorrelator and to exploit the property of exponential clustering in the equilibrium state .    after introducing the notation and outlining the main concepts ( ( i ) and ( ii ) ) in section [ sect : prel ] we write and prove in section [ sect : main ] our main result ( theorem 1 ) : namely , given any observable @xmath26 and hamiltonian @xmath27 of a finite lattice system of size @xmath15 , such that the interactions are translationally invariant , and another quasi - local extensive observable @xmath28 which has a property that the commutator @xmath29 = b_1 - b_n$ ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two operators supported at the left and the right boundary of the chain , we show that the drude weight ( [ eq : kubo ] ) is strictly bounded by a simple expression @xmath32 . in section [",
