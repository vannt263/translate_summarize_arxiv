    "the time evolution of a system consisting of a piston of mass @xmath0 moving parallel to the @xmath1-axis in a cube containing non - interacting point particles of unit mass has been studied extensively @xcite . after some rescaling of space and time ( by the length of the cube ) the problem reduces to that of a one dimensional system with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) particles in the interval @xmath4 $ ] ( resp .",
    ", @xmath5)$ ] where @xmath6 is the position of the piston .",
    "the left ( right ) particles move freely between collisions with the wall at @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and the piston at @xmath9 . at the walls",
    "the velocities of the particles get reversed while at @xmath9 the outgoing velocity @xmath10 is related to the incoming velocity @xmath11 by the rules of elastic collisions @xcite , v^= - v + v [ vprime ] where @xmath12 is the incoming velocity of the piston .",
    "it follows from ( [ vprime ] ) that @xmath13 , as well as the total kinetic energy , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are conserved quantities .",
    "the dynamics of the system can be reduced to a billiard in a @xmath16-dimensional domain ( polyhedron ) , cf .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , under certain quite restrictive conditions on the initial distribution of gas particles , that , in the limit @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the dynamics of the piston and the gas satisfy a closed system of euler - type hydrodynamical equations ( he ) for a time interval @xmath19 in which any particle had at most two collisions with the piston .",
    "the origin of the scaling @xmath18 is as follows . for @xmath20 particles with velocities of @xmath21 distributed with density of @xmath21 in a parallelopiped of length @xmath22 and crossectional area",
    "@xmath23 the number of particles colliding with the piston per unit ( unrescaled ) time and hence the pressure ( from each side ) is proportional to @xmath23 . to ensure that , on this time scale , the acceleration of the piston stays of @xmath21 as @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 grows to infinity it is necessary to make the mass of the piston grow as @xmath23 . for a cube this corresponds to @xmath18 . in the rescaled units the number of collisions experienced by the piston per unit time is of @xmath25 independent of @xmath23 and the he hold for general @xmath0 as long as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , i.e.  when the kinetic energy of the piston becomes negligible compared to that of the gas . the time interval ( in the scaled units )",
    "during which the derivation of the he remains valid depends on @xmath28 ( getting larger as @xmath29 ) , see remarks 3 and 4 in sect .",
    "4 of @xcite .",
    "for @xmath30 this time interval is such that the piston suffers no more than two collisions with any gas particle .",
    "it is however not clear from the derivation to what extent those equations may actually approximate the real evolution of the system with large @xmath20 , for longer times .",
    "this led us to carry out extensive computer simulations of particle systems , with @xmath31 , @xmath20 as large as @xmath32 @xcite , and initial conditions for which the hydrodynamic equations have trivial solutions @xmath33 and @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",
    "we found nevertheless that for certain initial velocity distributions the trajectory of the piston diverged from these values .",
    "in particular it was observed in these simulations that the particle plus piston system , after experiencing large random fluctuations , quickly converges to a more stable regime , in which the piston and the gas undergo regular slowly damped oscillations lasting a long time .",
    "the parameters of those oscillations ( the period , the amplitude , and the rate of damping ) seem to depend little on many details of the initial distributions .",
    "a possible explanation for this behavior is that the mechanical trajectory of the system with @xmath20 large but finite , being subjected to the intrinsic random fluctuations associated with the discrete nature of the gas particles , behaves as a perturbed solution of the he , i.e.as if the initial conditions were subjected to a small random perturbation .",
    "there large fluctuations in the particle dynamics observed experimentally in @xcite may thus be due to the instability of the he for the initial conditions considered .",
    "this would imply that , on the contrary , when the solution of the hydrodynamical equations is stable , then the mechanical evolution of the system should remain close to that solution for a very long time .    here",
    "we present evidence , but no proof , for this conjecture .",
    "we first find a class of initial conditions for which the solution of the he are stable and note that simulations with such distributions in @xcite indeed yielded a piston trajectory , which remained close to the solution of the he with @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the mechanical piston trajectories , which do not stay close to the solution of the he with the prescribed initial conditions , appear to follow some perturbed oscillating solutions of the he equations .",
    "these solutions appear to act as an `` attractor '' for the he .",
    "we can not rigorously prove the existence of attracting periodic solutions for the he yet , but we present some approximate constructions of such solutions .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 we state the hydrodynamical equations . in section 3",
    "we prove global stability for a class of stationary solution . in section 4",
    ", we use a perturbative analysis to find sufficient conditions for linear instability . in section 5",
    "we investigate a particular family of stationary solutions which include those used in the @xcite simulations and show that it contains both linearly stable and unstable ones , alternating in a very intricate manner . in section 6 , an approximate construction of periodic solutions of the he is presented .",
    "let @xmath37 be the position of the piston at time @xmath38 and @xmath39 its velocity .",
    "we denote the continuum density of the gas in @xmath40 \\times \\ir$ ] by a function @xmath41 .",
    "the he describing the time evolution of this , continuum fluid plus piston system , are as follows .    * _ free motion_. inside the container the density satisfies the standard continuity equation for a noninteracting particle system without external forces : ( + v ) p(x , v , t)=0 [ pdinside ] for all @xmath42 except @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath43 .",
    "equation ( [ pdinside ] ) has a simple solution p(x , v , t)=p(x - vs , v , t - s ) [ pinside ] for @xmath44 such that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 . equation ( [ pinside ] ) has one advantage over ( [ pdinside ] ) : it applies to all points @xmath47 , including those where the function @xmath48 is not differentiable , or even continuous .    * _ collisions with the walls_. at the walls @xmath7 and @xmath8 we have p(0,v , t ) = p(0,-v , t ) [ pwall0 ] p(1,v , t ) = p(1,-v , t ) [ pwall1 ] * _ collisions with the piston_. at the piston @xmath43 we have ( this is obtained from ( [ vprime ] ) when @xmath49 ) @xmath50 where @xmath11 represents the velocity after the collision and @xmath51 that before the collision ; and x(t ) = x(0 ) + _ 0^t",
    "v(s ) ds [ v = x ] is the ( deterministic ) position of the piston .",
    "it remains to describe the evolution of @xmath39 ( which we take to be left continuous ) .",
    "suppose the piston s position at time @xmath38 is @xmath52 and its velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the piston is affected by the fluid at @xmath47 exerting pressure on it from the right ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and from the left ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "accordingly , we define the density of the fluid in contact with the piston ( `` density on the piston '' ) by q(v , t;x , v)=\\ {    ll p(x+0,v , t ) & if  v < v + p(x-0,v , t ) & if  v > v +    .

    "( h1)-(h3 ) in the particle system is clear .",
    "( h4 ) is essentially a force balance equation  since the rate of collision of the piston with particles on either side and consequent force on piston is much larger than mass of the piston when @xmath58 , @xmath12 adjusts instantaneously to make the forces from the two sides balance exactly .",
    "the system of ( hydrodynamical ) equations ( h1)(h4 ) is now closed and , given initial conditions , satisfying ( 2.3)-(2.8 ) at @xmath59 , completely determine the functions @xmath6 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 for @xmath35 .",
    "when the initial conditions do not satisfy these equations one has to imagine that they become satisfied instantaneously for @xmath60 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of solutions of ( h1)(h4 ) were proven , under general conditions , in @xcite .",
    "we need only to assume that the @xmath61 is bounded , piecewise differentiable , and either has a compact support in the @xmath62 plane or decays fast enough as @xmath63 .",
    "we also require that @xmath64 for all @xmath1 .",
    "the he , like the vlasov equations for plasmas , are time - reversible , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they preserve the classical integrals of motion .",

    "2e = v^2 p(x , v , t)dv dx [ tildefpiston ]    equation ( [ quadraticint ] ) also preserves the total momentum @xmath66 , but the latter changes due to reflections at the walls .",
    "we note that the piston itself does not contribute to the total momentum and energy of the system in this model , because its mass and energy vanish , when divided by @xmath20 , in the limit @xmath67 .",
    "( the mass , energy and momentum of the fluid all correspond to the original quantities in the particle system divided by @xmath20 ) .",

    "then ( h1 ) translates into @xmath72 and @xmath73 whenever @xmath74 , ( h2 ) becomes @xmath75 whenever @xmath76 , and ( h3 ) gives @xmath77 whenever @xmath78 .",
    "note that the point @xmath79 moves in @xmath80 and reflects at the walls and the piston as if those had infinite mass .",
    "the motion of points in @xmath80 is described by a one - parameter family of transformations @xmath81 defined by @xmath82 for @xmath35 .",
    "we will also write @xmath83 . according to ( h1)(h3 ) , the density @xmath41 satisfies a simple equation @xmath84 for all @xmath71 .",

    "we will analyze in the next three sections the stability of this stationary solution .",
    "note that there is no requirement on the form of @xmath94 or @xmath95 ; all that is required is a balance of forces ( 2.10 ) .",

    "( there is a minor error in @xcite , the conditions that assure that the @xmath105 norm and the ( [ norm ] ) norm are equivalent are not explicitely assumed . )",
    "it is clear from ( [ tildefpiston ] ) that , given the position of the piston @xmath52 and values of the areas of the level sets , defined in @xmath106 , the minimal possible value of the total energy for any phase - space density @xmath107 , is attained when @xmath107 is uniform in @xmath1 and monotonically decreasing in @xmath108 in each compartment .",
    "consider first the case where @xmath107 has the same area of the level sets as some @xmath96 satisfying @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "hence , the `` reflection rule '' can be written as @xmath159 this expression suggests the introduction of new functions : @xmath160 and @xmath161 the above expression for @xmath162 can now be written as q_l(x ,- v , t)=q_l(x , v , t ) - q_l(x , v , t ) ( v)_+ + q_r(x , v , t ) ( v ) _ - [ ql ] similarly , on the other side of the piston , q_r(x , v , t)=q_r(x ,- v , t ) + q_l(x , v , t ) ( v)_+ - q_r(x , v , t ) ( v)_- [ qr ] one can interpret these `` reflection rules '' as follows : the functions @xmath163 and @xmath164 `` exchange '' their average values with respect to the `` density '' @xmath165 .",

    "the stationary solution ( [ statsol ] ) is stable , as we already know by theorem  [ tmstab1 ] . here",

    "one can also reverse this line of argument .",
    "indeed , when @xmath136 is not infinitesimally small but finite , the representation ( [ p1p2 ] ) implies that any perturbation @xmath61 of the rectangular density ( [ p1r ] ) for _ any _ @xmath286 will eventually grow exponentially fast in time ( because any @xmath398 can be approximated by rational numbers @xmath399 with even @xmath334 ) .",

    "the piston just swings back and forth with a monotonically increasing amplitude , as time goes on . for @xmath359 ,",

    "a typical trajectory of the piston @xmath6 found in our experiments is shown here on fig .",
    "one can see that during the initial interval of time @xmath402 the piston moves back and forth with an exponentially increasing amplitude , which is consistent with our analysis in section  [ secpa ] , where the density ( [ p12 ] ) was proven to be unstable .",
    "later on , however , at times @xmath404 , the amplitude of the piston s oscillations decreases to a certain constant value ( nearly a half of its maximum attained at @xmath405 ) .",

    "of course , due to the time - reversibility of the hydrodynamical equations there can be no attractors in the strict sense .",
    "it is more likely that there is an invariant manifold of periodic or quasi - periodic solutions that acts as a saddle point in the phase space : typical trajectories approach that manifold temporarily and then slowly move away .",

    "we will approximate such solutions up to the first order in @xmath136 , i.e.  ignoring terms of higher order .",

    "moreover , the region corresponding to high velocities @xmath410 is densely filled by such invariant curves , the larger @xmath411 the higher the density of invariant curves .",
    "this fact is a consequence of kam theory , it was first proved by r.  douady in his thesis @xcite and later independently by s.  laederich and m.  levi @xcite .",

    "<S> we analyze the stability of stationary solutions of a singular vlasov type hydrodynamic equation ( he ) . this equation was derived ( under suitable assumptions ) as the hydrodynamical scaling limit of the hamiltonian evolution of a system consisting of a massive piston immersed in an ideal gas of point particles in a box . </S>",
    "<S> we find explicit criteria for global stability as well as a class of solutions which are linearly unstable for a dense set of parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence ( but no proof ) that when the mechanical system has initial conditions `` close '' to stationary stable solutions of the he then it stays close to these solutions for a time which is long compared to that for which the equations have been derived . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> if the initial state of the particle system is close to an unstable stationary solutions of the he the mechanical motion follows for an extended time a perturbed solution of that equation : we find such approximate periodic solutions that are linearly stable .    6.25 in 8.5 in .25 in    [ section ] [ theorem]lemma [ theorem]sublemma [ theorem]proposition [ theorem]corollary [ theorem]remark </S>"
