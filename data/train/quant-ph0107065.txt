    "adiabatic passage is now a well established tool to achieve complete population transfer between discrete quantum states of atoms and molecules .",
    "the main advantage of the processes based on adiabatic passage is their relative robustness with respect to variation of field parameters .",
    "the adiabatic passage is achieved with adapted adiabatic variations of at least two _ effective _ parameters of the total laser field .",
    "they can be e.g. the amplitude and the detuning ( chirping ) or e.g. the amplitudes of two delayed pulses [ stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , see @xcite for a review ] . a chirp can be induced either by direct sweeping of the frequency of one laser pulse @xcite , or as proposed very recently by a stark shift of the transition due to an additional laser field [ process named stark chirped rapid adiabatic passage ( scrap ) ] @xcite .",
    "the use of adiabatic passage for multiple photon absorption and emission processes accompanying momentum exchanges between the atom and the laser fields have also been recently investigated @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that all of these adiabatic passage processes can be understood by an analysis of the topology of the surfaces of eigenenergies as functions of the field parameters .",
    "this tool allows us to derive new ways of controlling population transfer , related to stirap .",
    "the tools of analysis follow ref . @xcite . from an effective hamiltonian , which can be constructed by quasi - resonant approximations combined with adiabatic eliminations from the complete hamiltonian of the considered process , we determine and analyze the topology of the energy surfaces , which display conical intersections and avoided crossings due to resonances . in the general cases ,",
    "these resonances are induced by the fields ( dynamical resonances ) @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic dynamics of the process is determined by the topology of these energy surfaces and can be completely predicted .",
    "the dynamics governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation is thus reduced to the topology of the solutions of the time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "the essence of the adiabatic passage induced by chirping is captured with the effective two - state hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation @xcite @xmath3 , \\ ] ] which describes the radiative interaction between a two - level system ( states @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the quasi - resonant laser field through the effective rabi frequency @xmath6 and the effective detuning @xmath7 .",
    "we have assumed that spontaneous emissions are negligibly small on the time scale of the pulse duration .",
    "the population resides initially in the state @xmath4 .    in these processes ,",
    "@xmath6 stands for a one- or multi - photon rabi frequency ( depending on the process studied , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an effective two - photon chirping ) and @xmath8 is the sum of the detuning from the one- or multi - photon resonance and of the effective dynamical stark shift .",
    "this effective dynamical stark shift @xmath9 results from the difference of the dynamical stark shifts associated to the two energy levels and produced by the laser fields non resonant with the other levels of the system .",
    "for the _ direct chirping _ , the detuning from the resonance @xmath10 is time dependent due to an active sweeping of the laser frequency .",
    "the dynamical stark shifts @xmath11 are in general detrimental since they shift the levels away from the resonance . for the _ stark chirping _ , the quasi - resonant laser frequency is not chirped ( the detuning @xmath12 is time independent ) ; the time dependence of the effective detuning @xmath13 is only due to stark shifts which are induced by the laser pulses @xcite .",
    "the process can be completely described by the diagram of the two surfaces @xmath14 which represent the eigenenergies as functions of the instantaneous effective rabi frequency @xmath15 and detuning @xmath16 ( see fig . [ chirping ] ) .",
    "all the quantities are normalized with respect to a characteristic detuning denoted @xmath17 .",
    "they display a conical intersection for @xmath18 induced by the crossing of the lines characterizing the states @xmath4 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and various @xmath16 .",
    "the way of passing around or through this conical intersection is the key of the successful transfer .",
    "three generic curves representing all the possible passages with a negative initial detuning @xmath21 are shown .",
    "note that the three other equivalent curves with a positive initial detuning have not been drawn .",
    "the path ( a ) corresponds to a direct chirping of the laser frequency from the initial detuning @xmath22 to the final one @xmath23 . the paths ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to scrap with @xmath24 . for the path ( b ) , while the quasi - resonant pump pulse is off , another laser pulse ( the stark pulse , which is far from any resonance in the system ) is switched on and induces positive stark shifts @xmath25 ( the stark pulse frequency is chosen with this aim ) .",
    "the stark pulse makes thus the eigenstates get closer and induces a resonance with the pump frequency .",
    "this resonance is mute since the pump pulse is still off , which results in the true crossing in the diagram .",
    "the pump pulse is switched on after the crossing . later the stark pulse decreases while the pump pulse is still on .",
    "finally the pump pulse is switched off . as shown in the diagram , the adiabatic following of the path ( b )",
    "induces the complete population transfer from state @xmath4 to state @xmath26 .",
    "the path ( c ) leads exactly to the same effect : the pump pulse is switched on first ( making the eigenstates repel each other as shown in the diagram ) before the stark pulse @xmath25 which is switched off after the pump pulse .",
    "the conditions for adiabatic passage involving one unique statevector are standard : adiabatic evolution is satisfied when the rate of changes @xmath27 in the mixing angle @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 is much smaller than the separation of the eigenvalues @xmath30@xmath31 the peak amplitudes , the delay between the two fields and the pulse shapes are chosen such that these conditions of adiabatic passage are met .",
    "detailed conditions of adiabatic passage can be found in @xcite for delayed gaussian pulses .",
    "the adiabatic passage induced by two delayed laser pulses , the well known process of stirap , produces population transfer in @xmath32 systems ( see fig .",

    "it is known that , the initial population being in state @xmath4 , the complete population transfer is achieved with delayed pulses , either ( i ) with a so - called counterintuitive temporal sequence ( stokes before pump ) for various detunings as identified in refs @xcite , or ( ii ) with a two - photon resonant ( or quasi - resonant ) pulses but far from the one - photon resonance with the intermediate state @xmath26 , for any pulse sequence ( demonstrated in the approximation of adiabatic elimination of the intermediate state @xcite ) . here",
    "we revisit the stirap process through the topology of the associated surfaces of eigenenergies as functions of the two field amplitudes .",

    "we also show the following results which are new to our knowledge : ( i ) we can transfer the population to state @xmath34 with intuitive ( as with counterintuitive ) specific quasi - resonant pulses _ without invoking the approximation of adiabatic elimination _ , ( ii ) with specific quasi - resonant pulses , we can _ selectively _ transfer the population to state @xmath26 for an _ intuitive _ sequence or to state @xmath35 for a _ counterintuitive _ sequence , and ( iii ) with an intuitive or counterintuitive sequence , we can _ selectively _ transfer the population to state @xmath26 or to state @xmath35 playing on the _ detunings _ and on the _",
