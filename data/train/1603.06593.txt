    "<S> finite eccentricities in mass - transferring eccentric binary systems can be explained by taking into account mass - loss and mass - transfer processes that often occur in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> these processes can be treated as perturbations to the general two - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> the time - evolution equations for the semi - major axis and the eccentricity derived from perturbative methods are in general phase - dependent . the osculating semi - major axis and eccentricity change over the orbital timescale and they are not easy to implement in binary evolution codes like mesa . however , the secular orbital element evolution equations can be simplified averaging over the rapidly varying true anomalies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the secular time - evolution equations for the semi - major axis and the eccentricity for various mass - loss / transfer processes using either the adiabatic approximation or the assumption of delta - function mass - loss / transfer at periastron . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the cases of isotropic and anisotropic wind mass - loss . </S>",
    "<S> we continue with conservative and non - conservative non - isotropic mass ejection / accretion ( including rlof ) for both point - masses and extended bodies . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with the case of phase - dependent mass accretion . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the derived equations with similar work in the literature is included and explanation of the existing discrepancies is provided . </S>"
