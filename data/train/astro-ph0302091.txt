    "observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation is one of the most powerful tools of modern cosmology . a handful of experiments  boomerang ( netterfield et al .",
    "2002 ) , maxima ( hanany et al .",
    "2000 ) , dasi ( halverson et al . 2002 ) , vsa ( grainge et al . 2003 ) , cbi ( mason et al . 2003 ) , acbar ( kuo et al . 2004 ) , archeops ( benoit et al . 2003 ) , wmap ( bennett et al .",
    "2003a )  have already reported the measurement of cmb fluctuations at subdegree scales , allowing tight constraints to be placed on cosmological parameters . moreover",
    ", current and future cmb experiments will measure the fluctuations with unprecedented resolution , sensitivity , sky and frequency coverage .",
    "most notably , these include the wmap mission by nasa ( that will continue to take data in the next years ) and the planck mission by esa ( to be launched in 2007 ) , both of which will provide all - sky multifrequency observations of the cmb .",
    "when measuring the microwave sky , however , one does not only receive the cosmological signal but also emission from our own galaxy , thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich emissions from clusters of galaxies and emission from extragalactic point sources .",
    "in addition , instrumental noise and possibly some systematic effect will contaminate the data .",
    "therefore , our capacity to extract all the valuable information encoded in the cmb anisotropies will depend critically on our ability to separate the cosmological signal from the other microwave components .",
    "different methods have been proposed in the literature to perform this component separation .",
    "some techniques attempt to separate and reconstruct all the components at the same time , such as wiener filtering ( bouchet , gispert & puget 1996 , tegmark & efstathiou 1996 ) , the maximum - entropy method ( hobson et al .",
    "1998 , stolyarov et al 2002 ) or blind source separation ( baccigalupi et al . 2000 , maino et al .",
    "2002 , delabrouille et al .",
    "another approach is to extract only the component of interest from the data , as is the case , for example , when one is searching for emission from extragalactic point sources or the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters .",
    "methods for performing such a separation include the use of the mexican hat wavelet ( cayn et al .",
    "2000 , vielva et al .",
    "2001a , vielva et al . 2003 ) matched filters ( e.g. tegmark & de oliveira - costa 1998 ) , scale - adaptive filters ( sanz , herranz & martnez - gonzlez 2001 , herranz et al .",
    "2002a , b , c )  see also barreiro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for a comparison of the performance of these filters  , the mcclean algorithm ( hobson & mclachlan 2003 ) , the bayesian approach proposed by diego et al .",
    "( 2002 ) or the blind em algorithm of martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in the present work , we will focus on the maximum - entropy method ( mem ) for reconstruction of all components simultaneously .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied in reconstructing microwave components from simulated planck data in a small patch of the sky ( hobson et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter h98 ) .",
    "this work was extended to deal with point sources ( hobson et al .",
    "1999 ) and also combined with the mexican hat wavelet ( mhw ; vielva et al . 2001b ) .",
    "recently , the mem and mem+mhw algorithms have been adapted to deal with spherical data at full planck resolution by stolyarov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( hereafter s02 ) and stolyarov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) respectively .",
    "the algorithm is capable of analysing the vast amount of data expected from the planck mission by working in harmonic space , assuming independence between different harmonic coefficients .",
    "although this assumption is not necessarily true , the method is very successful in performing a full - sky component separation .",
    "nevertheless , it would be desirable to find a method that can perform this task without the assumption of independent harmonic modes , and can be applied directly in the space where the data have been observed .",
    "this would also allow one to introduce the properties of the noise in a more straightforward manner and to deal simply with incomplete and arbitrary shape sky coverage .",
    "another shortcoming of the standard mem approach to component separation is that the spectral dependence of the microwave components needs to be known a priori .",
    "although this is the case for the cmb and the kinetic and thermal sz effects , the spectral behaviour of the galactic foregrounds is only approximately known .",
    "moreover , it varies with position and frequency .",
    "the point sources , in particular , can cause problems , since each source will have a different spectral behaviour .",
    "this last point has been solved by combining mem with the mhw , which is optimised for the detection of point sources .",
    "nevertheless , the standard approach still lacks a way to estimate the spectral dependence of the diffuse components present in the data .    in this paper",
    ", we present a maximum - entropy component separation method that works in both real and harmonic space and is able to deal with many of the problems mentioned above .",
    "our analysis also includes a thorough study of the properties of the reconstructions to estimate the ( average ) spectral parameters for the galactic components .",
    "unfortunately , the price one has to pay for this flexible mem is to make the method much slower than the harmonic mem used in s02 . to illustrate the performance of the algorithm , we apply it first to simulated spherical data and then to a set of real spherical data available during the development of the algorithm , including the cobe - dmr , cobe - dirbe and haslam maps , from which we reconstruct the cmb emission and galactic foreground components .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : method ] we outline the flexible maximum - entropy component separation method .",
    "the spherical microwave data set that we have analysed is described in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : results_simu ] and [ sec : results_data ] are devoted to the analyses of simulated ( including an artificially low noise case ) and real data respectively .",
    "finally , we present our discussion and conclusions in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we outline the basics of our separation method , focusing particularly on the differences between the algorithm used in this work and traditional harmonic - based mem component separation . for a more detailed derivation of mem ,",
    "see hobson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and stolyarov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "our aim is to reconstruct the cmb anisotropies and the foreground components in the presence of instrumental noise from multifrequency microwave observations .",
    "we will assume that point sources have been previously subtracted using the mhw , or other filtering technique , and that their residual contribution is negligible .",
    "if we observe the microwave sky in a given direction @xmath6 at @xmath7 frequencies , we obtain a @xmath7-dimensional data vector that contains the observed temperature fluctuations in this direction at each observing frequency , plus instrumental noise .",
    "the observed data at the @xmath8th frequency in the direction @xmath6 can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the number of pixels in each map and @xmath11 is the number of physical components to be separated . as is usual for the mem algorithm",
    ", we make the assumption that each of the components can be factorised into a spatial template ( @xmath12 ) at a reference frequency @xmath13 and a frequency dependence encoded in @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 accounts for the instrumental beam and @xmath16 corresponds to the instrumental noise at frequency @xmath8 and position @xmath6 .",
    "if the beam is circularly symmetric and @xmath17 is measured over the whole sky , it is convenient to write the former equation in harmonic space as @xmath18 [ datalm ] where we have adopted the usual notation for spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath19 in which @xmath20 is a standard spherical harmonic function .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the spherical harmonic coefficients of the data and the noise at the @xmath8th frequency respectively , whereas @xmath23 are the harmonic coefficients of the @xmath24 component at the reference frequency .",
    "the response matrix @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 are the harmonic coefficients of the @xmath8th observing beam ) determines the contribution of each physical component to the data .",
    "using matrix notation , we have for each mode @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are column vectors of dimension @xmath7 , @xmath11 and @xmath7 complex components respectively , whereas the response matrix @xmath31 contains @xmath32 elements .",
    "if one neglects any correlations between different @xmath33 modes , the reconstruction can be performed mode - by - mode , which greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that the emission from each physical component and the instrumental noise are isotropic random fields on the sky .",
    "although , in reality , this is not the case , and so correlations do exist between different modes , the mode - by - mode harmonic - based mem produces excellent reconstructions . in this approximation ,",
    "the a priori covariance structure of the different components is assumed to take the form @xmath34 where we have made the additional simplifying assumption that the covariance matrix does depend only on @xmath35 .",
    "analogously , the ( cross ) power spectra for the noise can be written as @xmath36 thus , although the algorithm assumes statistical isotropy , it can straightforwardly include any a priori knowledge of the ( cross ) power spectra of the physical components and the noise at different observing frequencies .    as explained in h98 ,",
    "any a priori power spectrum information can be provided to the mem algorithm by introducing a ` hidden ' vector @xmath37 that is a priori uncorrelated ( see h98 ) and relates to the signal through @xmath38 where the lower triangular matrix @xmath39 is obtained by performing the cholesky decomposition of the cross power spectra @xmath40 of the physical components at @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the separation problem can be solved in terms of the hidden vector @xmath37 and the corresponding @xmath29 are subsequently found using ( [ hidden ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath41 itself can be iteratively determined by the mem ( h98 ) .",
    "that is , one can use an initial guess for @xmath41 to obtain a first reconstruction and subsequently compute the power spectra of those reconstructions , which are used as a starting point for the next iteration , until convergence is achieved .",
    "as shown in s02 , harmonic - based mem finds the best reconstruction for the sky by minimising mode - by - mode the function ( for a detailed derivation see s02 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the standard misfit statistic in harmonic space given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the cross entropy ( the form of which is given in h98 ) of the complex vector @xmath37 and the model @xmath46 , to which @xmath37 defaults in absence of data .",
    "the regularising parameter @xmath47 can be estimated in a bayesian manner by treating it as another parameter in the hypothesis space ( see @xmath48 ) .",
    "working in harmonic space and neglecting correlations between different modes vastly reduces the computational requirements of the component separation problem . instead of performing a single minimisation of @xmath49 parameters ,",
    "one performs @xmath50 minimisations of @xmath51 parameters , which is much faster .",
    "in addition , working in harmonic space provides us with a simple manner of introducing ( cross ) power spectra information in the algorithm through the @xmath52 matrix .      although the advantages of working in harmonic space are clear , there are also some shortcomings .",
    "in addition to the necessity of neglecting coupling between different @xmath33 modes , a full and regular coverage of the sky is needed in order to keep the harmonic transformations simple .",
    "the properties of the noise are also somewhat diluted in harmonic space and it is not obvious how anisotropic or correlated noise is affecting the algorithm .",
    "finally , it is not straightforward how to combine data taken in different spaces ( such as 1d scans , interferometric data , incomplete spherical data , etc . ) .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to develop a mem algorithm that is able to deal with all these issues , but still keeps as many advantages of the harmonic - based mem as possible .",
    "unfortunately , this is a non - trivial issue .    as a first approach ,",
    "we have implemented a mem algorithm that combines the space where the data have been taken and harmonic space .",
    "the best sky reconstruction is obtained by performing a single minimisation , with respect to the whole set of parameters @xmath53 , of the function @xmath54 where @xmath55 is evaluated in the space where the data have been taken . note that , in this case , there is no need to transform the data into harmonic space .",
    "moreover , the properties of the noise are well defined in data space and anisotropic noise can be easily included in the analysis .",
    "this is simply achieved by including the relevant noise dispersions in the noise covariance matrix of the misfit statistics @xmath56 .",
    "also , incomplete sky coverage or galactic masks can be taken into account , since the @xmath57 can be calculated summing only over a portion of the data .",
    "this method also allows the combination of different set of data by combining their @xmath55 values .",
    "the cross entropy , however , is still calculated in harmonic space by summing over the entropy @xmath45 for each mode , thereby preserving the straightforward introduction of power spectrum information into the algorithm . the reconstruction is thus still obtained in harmonic space , making necessary an inverse transform from the harmonic modes to real space ( which is usually much simpler than the forward transform ) .",
    "the form of @xmath57 , as a function of the hidden variables @xmath58 , for spherical pixelised data is given in appendix  [ derivatives ] .",
    "since we are not performing a mode - by - mode minimisation , correlations between modes may be taken into account by the algorithm .",
    "unfortunately , the price that one has to pay for such a flexible method is the need to perform a single minimisation of order @xmath59 parameters , which makes the method many times slower than harmonic mem .",
    "even so , we believe that it is worth exploring the possibilities of this algorithm , since it could be extremely useful in many applications that can not currently be performed by harmonic mem .      in order to perform the minimisation of the function",
    "given in ( [ phireal ] ) , we use a newton - raphson ( nr ) iterative algorithm . in the full nr method",
    ", the sky modes at iteration @xmath60 are obtained from their values at iteration @xmath61 via @xmath62 where ` loop gain ' @xmath63 is a parameter of order unity , whose optimal value is determined through the method itself , @xmath64 is an @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the number of parameters to be minimised ) containing the gradient of the function with respect to @xmath67 evaluated at @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the curvature ( or hessian ) matrix of dimension @xmath70 evaluated at @xmath71 .",
    "the form of the first and second derivatives of @xmath72 are given in h98 and those of @xmath43 for spherical pixelised data are given in appendix  [ derivatives ] .",
    "unfortunately , with this scheme , one needs to calculate and invert the hessian matrix with dimension @xmath70 , which is not feasible even for low - resolution data .",
    "nevertheless , the main part played by the hessian matrix in the nr method is to provide a scale length for the minimisation algorithm .",
    "thus , the success of the algorithm does not require a very accurate determination of the hessian ( indeed , many minimisation algorithms achieve very good results using only gradient information ) . in practice , therefore , we calculate only an approximation to the hessian matrix in the nr algorithm .",
    "we have found that good results are obtained by approximating the hessian by a block diagonal matrix with blocks of size @xmath73 , and setting the remaining elements to zero .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that @xmath74 unless @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where the indices @xmath77 refers to the real or imaginary part of @xmath78 and @xmath79 to each of the considered components to be reconstructed . in this case , the inversion of the matrix can be performed block - by - block , which simplifies the problem enormously .",
    "note that the value of each @xmath80 mode still depends on the values of all the rest of the modes through the gradient vector ( see appendix  [ derivatives ] ) .",
    "another important issue is the determination of the regularisation parameter @xmath47 .",
    "as explained in h98 , @xmath47 can be obtained in a fully bayesian manner by including it as another parameter in the hypothesis space , and maximising the bayesian evidence with respect to it .",
    "in particular , one finds that it must satisfy @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the ( diagonal ) metric of the image space ( see h98 for details ) .",
    "note that in order to solve this implicit equation we also need to operate with the hessian matrix . to make this task feasible , we again approximate @xmath84 by a block diagonal matrix with blocks @xmath85 .",
    "this allows one to find a ( nearly ) optimal value for the @xmath47 parameter .      following h98 and s02",
    ", we can also obtain an estimation of the covariance matrix of the reconstruction errors @xmath86 on the harmonic modes @xmath87 , as well as the dispersion of the residual map for each component .",
    "in particular , by again approximating @xmath84 by a block diagonal matrix , we find @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the @xmath85 block of the hessian matrix corresponding to the @xmath33 mode evaluated at @xmath90 .",
    "as shown by s02 , the former equation allows us to obtain the residuals power spectrum at component @xmath24 simply by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is given by the @xmath24th diagonal entry of the diagonal matrix @xmath93 .",
    "finally , we can estimate the dispersion @xmath94 of each residual map as : @xmath95      in order to apply the mem algorithm , one needs to assume that the spectral behaviour of all the components to be reconstructed is known and spatially constant .",
    "this is the case for the cmb and the sz effects , but it is not true for the diffuse galactic components . although there has been considerable effort in recent years to study the galactic foregrounds at microwave frequencies , there are still uncertainties in the knowledge of the frequency dependence of free - free , synchrotron and dust emissions ( as well as in their spatial distribution ) .",
    "in addition , this frequency dependence is expected to vary across the sky . to study the synchrotron emission ,",
    "the most extensively used data has been the 408 mhz map of haslam et al .",
    "more recently , reich & reich ( 1986 ) and jonas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measured the emission of the northern ( at 1420 mhz ) and southern ( at 2326 mhz ) galactic hemispheres respectively . at these frequencies the synchrotron emission dominates the total galactic emission , and therefore these data sets are very useful in characterising this foreground .",
    "the combination of these maps allows one to estimate the frequency dependence of the synchrotron in this frequency range .",
    "reich & reich ( 1988 ) obtained an average value of the synchrotron spectral index of -2.7 ( assuming a power law in temperature units ) in the northern hemisphere .",
    "giardino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) generated an spectral index map for the whole sky , whose average value is also -2.7 .",
    "more recently , the wmap team ( bennett et al .",
    "2003b ) found that the synchrotron power law in the wmap range frequency is relatively flat inside the galactic plane with an index of -2.5 whereas it steepens to @xmath96 outside the galaxy .",
    "thermal dust emission is usually modelled by a grey - body whose emissivity depends on the physical properties of the materials that constitute the dust ( see e.g. desert , boulanger & puget , 1990 ; banday & wolfendale , 1991 ) . recently",
    ", there has been an effort to produce a dust template , as well as to determine its frequency dependence at microwave frequencies . in particular , schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) produced a dust map at 3000 ghz using iras and cobe - dirbe data .",
    "they also characterised the dust emission in the 1250 - 3000 ghz range with a grey body law with an emissivity of @xmath1 and a varying spatial temperature with values around 17 - 21 k. more recently , finkbeiner , davis & schlegel ( 1999 ) proposed an improved two - component dust model using the iras , cobe - dirbe and cobe - firas data .",
    "the so - called cold component is characterised by a mean temperature of 9.4 k and an emissivity of 1.67 whereas the spectral parameters of the hot component take values of 16.2 k and 2.7 respectively .",
    "the least well known of the galactic foregrounds is the free - free emission .",
    "usually , it is estimated through two different tracers : the thermal dust emission and the h@xmath97 emission .",
    "up to a few years ago , no h@xmath97 surveys were available and thermal dust was normally used to produce free - free templates , taking into account the correlation found for instance between the cobe - dirbe and cobe - dmr data ( kogut et al .",
    "recently , several h@xmath97 surveys have been produced : the virginia tech spectral line survey ( vtss ) of the northern hemisphere ( dennison , simonetti & topasna 1998 ) , the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) that covers a large fraction of the sky ( reynolds , haffner & madsen 2002 ) and the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa ) of the southern hemisphere ( gaustad et al .",
    "even more recently , all - sky free - free templates have been generated combining the information of the different surveys ( dickinson , davies & davis 2003 , finkbeiner 2003 ) .",
    "the spectral dependence of the free - free emission is normally modelled as a power law ( in temperature ) with spectral index around -2.16 ( e.g. kogut et al .",
    "1996 , smoot 1998 ) .",
    "there are also uncertainties in the number of components that contribute to the microwave sky .",
    "in fact , an anomalous galactic emission at low frequency , which is well correlated with the thermal dust one , has been found by several authors ( de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 , leitch et al . 1997 and",
    "kogut 1999 ) . a possible candidate for this component has been proposed by draine & lazarian ( 1998 ) : electric dipole emission coming from rapidly rotating dust grains ( `` spinning dust '' ) .",
    "the first statistical evidence for spinning dust was given by de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "finkbeiner et al . (",
    "2002 ) found two tentative detections of this emission in two ( out of ten ) small areas of the sky .",
    "however , bennett et al . ( 2003b ) established that the spinning dust contribution to the wmap frequencies is clearly subdominant .    in summary , in order to apply our mem algorithm , and taking into account all the uncertainties in the knowledge of the galactic foregrounds",
    ", we need a way to model their spectral behaviour , which makes use of our prior knowledge of the foregrounds as well as of the data themselves .",
    "additionally , it would be desirable to be able to accommodate spatial variations of the spectral parameters .",
    "one possibility to determine the ( spatially constant ) frequency parameters from the data themselves would be to use an iterative approach , assuming a known spectral law for the components .",
    "the procedure would be as follows : ( i ) reconstruct the microwave components with mem using an initial guess for the unknown spectral parameters ; ( ii ) use the reconstructions as templates to fit for the spectral parameters and the normalisation of the components ( by minimising @xmath43 ) ; ( iii ) use these new parameters as a starting point to run mem again ; ( iv ) repeat the procedure until convergence .",
    "we have tested this method on our set of simulated data , but unfortunately it did not always converge to the correct values . however , these data have a low signal - to - noise ratio and we need to fit for several spectral parameters at the same time , which leads to degeneracies .",
    "in addition , mem will drive the reconstructions towards the templates that best fit the initial ( incorrect ) spectral parameters , which may be far from the templates that fit the correct parameters .",
    "all these factors make it very difficult to estimate the frequency dependence of the components with this method for our set of data .",
    "nevertheless , if high quality data are available , or if a single component needs to be fitted , this method should be further investigated .",
    "a different approach is to run mem for different sets of spectral parameters and try to infer from the reconstructed components which parameters give the best results and are , therefore , closest to the truth .",
    "one could naively look at the estimated errors and pick the reconstructions with the lowest values for these errors .",
    "however , the estimation of the errors depend on the chosen spectral parameters .",
    "basically , it gives the statistical error of the reconstruction but it does not take into account uncertainties in the values of the spectral parameters . therefore , if our guess of the frequency dependence is incorrect , the error estimation of the reconstructions is not reliable .",
    "jones et al . ( 2000 ) showed that the dust frequency dependence could be estimated from planck simulated data of small patches of the sky by minimising the @xmath43 of the reconstructions .",
    "they assumed a ( spatially constant ) grey body law for the dust emission with two unknown parameters ( the dust temperature and emissivity ) , which they were able to fit from the data by looking at the minimum of the @xmath43 of the reconstructions .",
    "however , varying the spectral index @xmath98 of the synchrotron or free - free emissions ( assuming a power law @xmath99 ) had little effect on the value of the @xmath43 and could not be determined in this way .",
    "this was due to the fact that both the synchrotron and free - free emissions have a low amplitude with respect to the rest of the components in the considered region of the sky and therefore the data could not provide enough information to fit these two components . in this case , the reconstructions of these two emissions were lost , but those of the other components were little affected .",
    "this application shows that , depending on the characteristics of the data ( sky coverage , resolution , signal - to - noise ratio , frequency coverage , etc . )",
    "we may not be able to estimate some of the spectral parameters using just the @xmath43 value .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate all the spectral parameters we may need to use also information coming from other variables , such as the entropy or the cross correlations between the reconstructed cmb and the galactic components .",
    "we have used such an approach to determine empirically the best reconstructions , which is explained in detail in @xmath100 .",
    "the only spherical cmb dataset available during the development of the flexible mem algorithm was cobe - dmr data . in order to enable the reconstruction of different components of emission",
    ", we also make use of the cobe - dirbe and haslam maps .",
    "each of these maps exist in the healpix pixelization ( grski et al .",
    "1999 ) with @xmath101 , which corresponds to 12288 pixels of size 107 arcminutes .",
    "since each of these datasets has been described in detail elsewhere , we just give a brief description in this section .",
    "the data maps in mjy / sr are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] .",
    "the cobe - dmr data consists of three frequency maps : 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz ( each of them obtained by the combination of two channels ) with a resolution of @xmath102 degrees and a signal - to - noise ratio of around 2 per 10 degree patch .",
    "the cobe - dmr data have an anisotropic noise pattern that can be easily taken into account with our method . as an illustration",
    "we show the noise dispersion per pixel for the 53 ghz channel in fig  [ fig : noise53 ] .",
    "the cobe beam is well characterized by the curve given in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam ] ( wright et al . 1994 ) . for comparison",
    ", a gaussian beam with 7 degree of full width half maximum ( fwhm ) is also shown .",
    "dispersion noise per pixel of the cobe - dmr 53 ghz map in mjy / sr.,width=302 ]    the cobe - dirbe experiment observed the brightness of the full sky at ten wavelengths from 1.2 to 240 microns as well as mapping linear polarization at 1.2 , 2.2 and 3.5 microns . in our analyses below we use the data at the two lowest frequencies ( 1249 and 2141 ghz ) .",
    "the maps have been degraded down to @xmath103 and smoothed with a gaussian beam of fwhm 2.4 times the pixel size ( i.e. , fwhm = 263.8 arcmin ) .",
    "the cobe - dirbe noise is also anisotropic , but since we have significantly degraded the resolution of the data , its level is very small .",
    "the cobe - dirbe beam has a resolution of 0.7 degrees and can be approximately modelled by a top - hat . at these frequencies , ( thermal )",
    "dust emission dominates and therefore these data help the algorithm to extract the dust component .",
    "the haslam map gives the emission of the whole sky at 408 mhz and has been obtained by combining four different surveys ( haslam et al . 1982 ) .",
    "it has an effective resolution of 51 arcminutes .",
    "recently , finkbeiner , davis & schlegel ( private communication ) have reprocessed the original haslam map to provide a destriped , point - source subtracted map , which we have used for our analysis .",
    "we have degraded its resolution down to the healpix resolution of @xmath103 and smoothed it with a gaussian beam of fwhm=263.8 arcmin . at this frequency the emission is dominated by galactic synchrotron , providing mem with excellent information to trace this component .",
    "before applying of our flexible mem component separation method to real data , we have checked its performance on simulated datasets . in order to simulate our sets of data ( cobe - dmr , cobe - dirbe and haslam maps ) we have assumed that the sky contains , cmb , free - free , synchrotron and thermal dust emissions .",

    "these are also indications of the fact that we have some galactic contamination in our reconstructed map , especially at high galactic latitudes .",
    "the free - free reconstructed power spectra presents the same behaviour as in the simulated case .",

    ", we also find what seems to be an excess of power at high @xmath35 values for the reconstructed power spectrum outside the galactic plane .",
    "we have presented a flexible mem algorithm that combines the advantages of real ( or data ) space and harmonic space . on the one hand ,",
    "the @xmath43 is calculated in data space , which allows one to include straightforwardly the properties of the noise as well as incomplete sky coverage . on the other hand ,",
    "the entropy is estimated in harmonic space allowing easy introduction of available prior information about the power spectra of the components that we aim to reconstruct .",
    "in addition , the method takes into account correlations between different modes because we perform a single minimisation of @xmath126 variables instead of minimising mode - by - mode as in harmonic mem .",
    "we perform this global minimisation using a newton - raphson method , which needs the hessian matrix @xmath69 to be evaluated and inverted . in practice , this is not feasible since we have a very large number of variables so we have approximated @xmath69 by a block diagonal matrix , which gives very good results . unfortunately , this minimisation is very time consuming and the method is many times slower than harmonic mem .    to test the performance of the method we have applied it to simulated spherical data and then to real data . in particular , we have used the three frequency channels of cobe - dmr , the haslam map and the lowest frequency map of cobe - dirbe to reconstruct the cmb , free - free , synchrotron and dust emissions .",
    "an important issue that has been thoroughly studied in the present work is the determination of the frequency dependence of the different components .",
    "we have modelled the free - free and synchrotron with a power law parametrised by indices @xmath127 and @xmath115 respectively and the dust by a grey body model with two parameters ( the dust temperature @xmath128 and the dust emissivity @xmath129 ) .",
    "we have then applied the mem algorithm to our simulated data ( generated using @xmath130 and @xmath1 ) for many combinations of the spectral parameters and have studied the behaviour of different diagnostic quantities when the assumed values of these parameters depart from the true ones .",
    "firstly , we have studied a low noise case where the noise level of the cobe - dmr simulated maps have been lowered by a factor of 5 . in this case",
    "we find that the @xmath43 value of the reconstructions can successfully identify the correct set of spectral parameters .",
    "in addition , we also find that there exists a high correlation between the error of the cmb reconstruction and other quantities that can be directly estimated from the reconstructed maps .",
    "in particular , together with the @xmath43 value , the entropy , the @xmath131 function , the dispersion of the cmb reconstructed map , and the cross correlations between the reconstructed cmb and galactic components are good indicators of the quality of the reconstructions .    secondly , we have applied mem to our set of simulated data using realistic levels of noise for the same sets of spectral parameters . due to the low signal to noise ratio of our data set , we find that the @xmath43 is not longer able to pick the right combination of spectral parameters .",
    "therefore we have constructed an empirical selection function @xmath132 which is given by a linear combination of @xmath43 , @xmath133 , @xmath131 , the dispersion of the cmb reconstructed map , and the cross correlations between the reconstructed cmb and galactic components .",
    "we pick as our best set of reconstructions the one with the lowest value of @xmath132 .",
    "we have considerd a total of 81 different cases , with three possible values for each spectral parameter . using the quantity @xmath132",
    ", we can clearly see that the correct dust model is clearly preferred over the others ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : param_simu ] ) .",
    "however , it is very difficult to pick the correct values of the spectral indices for the free - free and synchrotron , since our data do not have enough information .",
    "in fact the quantity @xmath132 is almost identical for the 5 best cases due to the fact that our noisy data can accomodate a range of different spectral models . in any case , even if we can not determine unambiguosly the spectral parameters for the free - free and synchrotron component , the cmb reconstruction is very robust outside the galactic cut and the differences between the cmb reconstructions for the cases with lower values of @xmath132 are well within the statistical errors . in particular the level of the dispersion of the residuals of the smoothed 7 degree reconstructed cmb map outside",
    "the galactic cut ranges between 21.2 and 22.0 @xmath104k for all the cases between 1 and 30 .",
    "to illustrate this point we can also look at the differences in the cmb reconstructed power spectra for the different cases .",
    "[ fig : psmean_simu ] shows the cmb power spectrum obtained for case 1 ( solid line ) versus the average power spectrum obtained from the 5 cases with lower values of @xmath132 .",
    "the error bars correspond to the dispersion in the values of the @xmath120 s obtained from the former 5 cases .",
    "note that this dispersion is very small , which shows that the recovered cmb power spectrum is also very robust for these 5 cases .",
    "this also indicates that , at least for ideal simulated foregrouns with spatially constant spectral parameters , the error introduced in the cmb power spectrum due to the wrong identification of these parameters ( provided we pick one of the reconstructions with a lower value of @xmath132 ) is much smaller than the statistical error .",
    "for case 1 ( the case with the correct spectral parameters ) we have found that the cmb error reconstruction for the ( realistic ) simulated data is at the level of 21 @xmath104k .",
    "the level of cmb residuals are comparable inside and outside the galactic cut , which indicates that the cmb has been equally well recovered in both regions of the sky .",
    "note that the estimated error given by the method is @xmath134 .",
    "the recovered cmb power spectrum follows the input one up to @xmath135 and then starts to drop due to the resolution of the cobe - dmr data .",
    "this result is again comparable inside and outside the galactic plane .",
    "the free - free emission has been recovered with a residual error of @xmath136 in the galactic plane at 50 ghz . at high galactic latitude , the free - free reconstruction has basicly been lost .",
    "this result also shows in the reconstructed power spectrum , where we find a clear excess of structure at @xmath137 outside the galactic cut , whereas mem is able to recover it up to @xmath122 inside the galaxy .",
    "the synchrotron and dust emissions have been very well recovered in the galactic plane with errors of @xmath138 per cent and @xmath139 per cent , respectively .",
    "outside the galactic cut the reconstruction is also quite good , at the level of @xmath140 per cent for the synchrotron and @xmath141 per cent for the dust .",
    "the whole - sky power spectra follows also quite faithfully the input one up to @xmath142 for the synchrotron and up to @xmath143 for the dust .",
    "however , the recovered dust power spectrum shows some excess at small scales when only the region outside the galactic cut is considered .",

    "however , the value of @xmath131 , @xmath43 , @xmath133 , @xmath150 and thus of @xmath132 are a bit higher than the ones found for the simulated cases .",
    "this indicates that our model does not fit the data as well as in the ideal case .",
    "this is not surprising taking into account the large number of uncertainties of the data : the frequency dependence of the model , variation of the spectral parameters across the sky or in the frequency range or even the presence of some unknown component . in spite of this",

    ", some dust models are clearly favoured with respect to the others ( fig .",
    "[ fig : param_data ] ) although the situation is not so clear as in the ideal case .",
    "again this is due to all the uncertainties we have with respect to the frequency behaviour of the components which make the presence of degenerate cases even more important than in the simulated case .",
    "the reconstructed maps for the four components are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : rec_data ] for case 1 ( the one with the lowest values of @xmath132 ) and the corresponding dispersions of the reconstructions as well as the estimated errors are shown in table  [ tab : rms_data ] . from these results",

    "for instance the dispersion of the recovered cmb is at the level of 35 @xmath104k outside the galactic cut , whereas in the galactic centre has a value of @xmath152k .",
    "this is another indication of the fact that our model for the galactic components is not properly fitting the data .",
    "however , we believe that the reconstructed cmb sky outside the galaxy is reasonably well recovered . even if our assumptions about the spectral behaviour of the components are wrong , we have seen in the simulations that this had very little effect in the cmb reconstructed map outside the galactic cut , providing we are taking cases with low values of @xmath132 .",

    "this further confirms the fact that we are not fully subtracting the galaxy",

    "we have tested this possibility by adding to our set of data the second cobe - dirbe channel ( at 2141 ghz ) and reconstructing two dust components .",

    "each of them may not have a physical meaning but the extra degree of freedom should help to account for temperature variations of the dust component .",
    "in fact , the cold dust component presents negative as well as positive values in the reconstructed map and should be understood as a correction to the hot component , which helps to fit both of the cobe - dirbe maps at high frequencies as well as some excess emission at lower frequencies .",
