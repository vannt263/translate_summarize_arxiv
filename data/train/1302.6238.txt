    "an important difference between the tevatron and lhc is that the latter can produce and study top quarks in great numbers  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to investigate all different top production mechanisms in detail , including their qcd structure . after the discovery of a higgs - like  @xcite resonance , studying its coupling to the top quark",
    "will play a particularly critical role in our understanding of the higgs sector .",
    "this is made most obvious in the renormalization group evolution of the higgs potential to large energy scales  @xcite .",
    "the direct measurement of the top yukawa coupling clearly hinges on top quark identification and reconstruction . at the same time",
    ", we have reason to suspect that new physics that solves the hierarchy problem and lives at sufficiently high energy scales tends to couple strongly to top quarks  @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to search for new physics in the lhc top sample ; for example by searching for top pair resonance structures of top pair production associated with missing transverse momentum .",
    "historically , the study of top pair production has largely been restricted to semi - leptonic decays of the two tops quarks .",
    "the reason is that the lepton effectively removes the overwhelming qcd background .",
    "however , purely leptonic top pairs not only come at a much smaller rate , they also include two neutrinos , challenging any analysis based on the observed missing transverse momentum . a major challenge in top physics at the lhc is how to gain access to the purely hadronic decays of top quarks .",
    "identifying hadronic top decays using a jet algorithm was part of the original proposal of jet substructure analyses  @xcite .",
    "some of the early jet substructure algorithms were designed to target hadronic top decays  @xcite .",
    "while higgs taggers  @xcite should clearly have a high priority within the lhc experiments , working top taggers are the perfect laboratory to test how well substructure approaches work in practice .",
    "the moment we go beyond searches for heavy resonances the main problem of all top taggers is the size of the initial fat jet .",
    "for example , using the cambridge ",
    "aachen jet of size @xmath0 as the starting point of the heptoptagger  @xcite limits the momentum range of reconstructable top quarks to @xmath1  gev .",
    "essentially , all other top tagging approaches require even higher boost .",
    "increasing the size of the fat jet to @xmath2 raises several qcd and combinatorics issues  @xcite .",
    "the big question in using hadronic top analyses as part of higgs searches or top partner searches is how to further reduce this top momentum threshold .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative method for an efficient top reconstruction at moderate momentum .",
    "it targets the transverse momentum regime , @xmath3 in the fully hadronic decay mode . starting from an event with a high multiplicity of jets",
    ", we assign all jets into three groups or ` buckets ' .",
    "the buckets are chosen based on a metric in terms of invariant masses , defining two top buckets and a third bucket containing the extra hadronic activity like initial state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "while initially this search strategy does not prefer boosted top quarks , we will see how such events are eventually preferred from a combinatorics perspective .    in section  [ sec :",
    "simple ] we start with a simple algorithm for reconstructing tops in buckets .",
    "we test this algorithm for hadronically decaying top pairs as well as @xmath4+jets and pure qcd jets backgrounds .",
    "additional handles will help us separate the top signal from the backgrounds . in section",
    "[ sec : bb ] , we modify the simple algorithm to take advantage of the @xmath5 quarks and @xmath4 bosons that are present in top decays but not in the qcd backgrounds .",
    "this improved bucket algorithm is optimized to efficiently find and reconstruct top pairs with moderate @xmath6 . in section",
    "[ sec : stop ] we apply our bucket algorithm to stop pair searches .",
    "in this section , we start with a simple algorithm to identify and reconstruct hadronically decaying top pairs . while an improved algorithm will be presented in the next section , this simple version captures many of the key concepts we will employ later .",
    "the overall scheme is fairly straightforward : by assumption every jet originates from one of the two tops or from initial state radiation , so we assign every jet to one of three ` buckets ' .",
    "jets in buckets @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to top decays , while all remaining jets are placed in @xmath9 .",
    "we cycle through every permutation of jet assignments to minimize the distance between the invariant masses of the jets in @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the top mass .",
    "the metric is chosen to ensure that bucket @xmath7 reconstructs the top mass better than bucket @xmath8 .",
    "here and throughout the remainder of the paper , all standard model ( sm ) samples are generated with alpgen+pythia  @xcite .",
    "we use matrix - level matching  @xcite to correctly describe jet radiation over the entire phase space .",
    "this includes up to @xmath10 + 2  jets , @xmath4 + 4  jets and @xmath11 qcd jets , with the top cross sections normalized to next - to - next - to - leading order  @xcite .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the cambridge / aachen algorithm  @xcite of size @xmath12 in fastjet  @xcite .",
    "note that all our results are relatively insensitive to the choice of jet algorithm .",
    "all leptons we require to be hard and isolated : @xmath13 gev and no track of another charged particle within @xmath14 around the lepton .",
    "we consider only jets with @xmath15  gev and @xmath16 . even though the algorithm presented in this section is in principle applicable to events with any number of jets we preselect events with five or more jets to reduce qcd backgrounds . because we are interested in hadronically decaying @xmath10 pairs we veto on isolated leptons .",
    "the restricted sample denoted as @xmath17 has a cross section of 104  pb at the lhc with @xmath18  tev .",
    "one last word concerning underlying event and pile - up : unlike methods involving jet substructure  @xcite our bucket reconstruction relies on standard jets with moderately large multiplicities , so aside from jet energy scale uncertainties we do not expect specific experimental or theoretical challenges .      as the goal of the bucket algorithm is to identify tops by sorting jets into categories that resemble tops , we need a metric to determine the similarity of a collection of jets to a top . for simple buckets @xmath19",
    "it is @xmath20 where we sum over all four - vectors in the bucket . for each event with five or more jets",
    "we permute over all possible groupings of the jets into three buckets @xmath21 .",
    "we then select the combination that minimizes a global metric defined as @xmath22 the factor @xmath23 stabilizes the grouping of jets into buckets . in this work",
    "we take @xmath24 , effectively decoupling @xmath25 from the metric . as a consequence we always find @xmath26 ,  @xmath7 is the bucket with an invariant mass closer to that of the top than the invariant mass of bucket @xmath8 .",
    "other values of @xmath27 might eventually turn out more appropriate for different applications . as the first selection cut",
    "we require the invariant masses of both top buckets , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , to lie in the window @xmath28 the lower limit selects events above the jacobian peak for top decays .",
    "we will see that this selection improves the top signal over qcd background @xmath29 by about a factor of two .",
    "all buckets passing eq .",
    "we categorize by their number of jets ; buckets including three or more jets ( @xmath30-buckets ) and those including two jets ( @xmath31-buckets ) . selecting only events with two @xmath30-buckets",
    "improves the signal - to - background ratio by a factor of five .      for tagging two tops in fully hadronic mode",
    ", we might naively require at least six reconstructed jets .",
    "in practice , with a threshold of @xmath32  gev this condition is too strict . to improve our efficiency we need to consider the case where one of the jets from top pair decays is missing .",
    "it is also worth noting that even requiring six jets does not guarantee that we collect all six decay products of the top pair .",

    "<S> reconstructing hadronically decaying top quarks is a key challenge at the lhc , affecting a long list of higgs analyses and new physics searches . we propose a new method of collecting jets in buckets , corresponding to top quarks and initial state radiation </S>",
    "<S> this method is particularly well suited for moderate transverse momenta of the top quark , closing the gap between top taggers and traditional top reconstruction . applying it to searches for supersymmetric top squarks we illustrate the power of buckets . </S>"
