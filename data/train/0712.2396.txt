    "in recent papers , bini , de felice and geralico ( 2006 , 2007 ) considered how the relative deviations among the particles of a given bunch depend on the geometric properties of the frame adapted to a fiducial observer . here",

    "let @xmath5 be a fixed world line of the congruence which we consider as that of the fiducial observer .",
    "`` the separation between the line @xmath5 and a line of @xmath0 is represented by a connecting vector @xmath6 , i.e. a vector undergoing lie transport along @xmath1 , namely @xmath7 .",

    "the covariant derivative along @xmath1 of both sides of the lie transport equation gives rise to the relative deviation equation '' which , once projected on a given spatial triad @xmath13 , reads : [ eq : secder3bis ] y^a + k_(u , e)^a_b y^b=0  , where @xmath14^a{}_b$ ] .",

    "( 2006 ) , characterizes the given frame relative to a fermi - walker frame along the congruence .",
    "we like to stress here that the components of the deviation vector should be restricted to the reference observer s world line ; they may behave differently according to the reference frame set up for their measurements .",
    "consider kerr spacetime , whose line element in kerr - schild coordinates @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the flat spacetime metric and k_x^=-t -- z  , with @xmath26 implicitly defined by + = 1  . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the total mass and specific angular momentum characterizing the spacetime .",
    "consider now a set of particles moving along the @xmath29-direction , on and nearby the axis of symmetry , with four velocity [ boost1 ] u=  , = ( 1-^2)^-1/2  , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 and where the instantaneous linear velocity @xmath33 , relative to the local static observers , is function of @xmath29 .",
    "these particles are accelerated except perhaps those which move strictly on the axis of symmetry .",

    "it is now possible to study the components of the vector @xmath6 connecting a specific curve of the congruence which we fix along the rotation axis with @xmath38 with tangent vector @xmath39 and nearby world lines of the same congruence .",
    "the reference world line is accelerated along the direction @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 , with @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the restriction on the axis of that metric coefficient .",
    "in order to determine the deviations measured by the fiducial observer \" @xmath39 with respect to the chosen frame we need to evaluate the kinematical fields of the congruence , namely the acceleration @xmath44 , the vorticity @xmath45 and the expansion @xmath46 ) , the electric part of the weyl tensor @xmath15 , the strain tensor @xmath18 and the characterization of the spatial triad @xmath36 with respect to a fermi - walker frame given by the tensor @xmath47 .",

    "( [ elermn])([strainsgen ] ) it follows that the deviation matrix @xmath54 has only the non - zero component [ kab ] k_(u , e)_3 3=--[a(u)^3]^2+e(u)_3 3  ; hence , as expected , the particles emitted nearby the axis in the @xmath29-direction will be relatively accelerated in the @xmath29-direction only .",
    "the spatial components of the connecting vector @xmath6 are then obtained by integrating the deviation equation ( [ eq : secder3bis ] ) which now reads @xmath55 equations ( [ eq2ordrad ] ) can be analytically integrated to give [ soly ] y^1=y^1_0,y^2=y^2_0 , y^3=c  , where @xmath56 is a constant .",
    "this result shows that the conditions imposed on the particles of the bunch to move parallel to the axis of rotation is assured by a suitable balancing among the gravitoelectric ( curvature ) tensor ( [ elermn ] ) , the inertial tensor ( [ variousqua_rad2 ] ) and the strain tensor ( [ strainsgen ] ) .",
