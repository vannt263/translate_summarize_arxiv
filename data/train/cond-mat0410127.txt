    "the breakdown of fermi liquid behaviour in the neighbourhood of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) has been observed in an increasing number of heavy fermion materials in recent years @xcite , but so far has not received an adequate explanation .",
    "the qcp is the point at which the transition temperature @xmath10 for long range magnetic order , usually antiferromagnetic , is such @xmath11 , having been driven down via the application of pressure or alloying to a magnetically ordered material ( see for example refs .  ) . in these circumstances",
    "the wilson theory for critical behaviour has to be extended to include quantum as well as thermal fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "such generalizations have been carried out @xcite but the results do not appear to be consistent with the experimental observations . the experimental evidence , for instance from neutron scattering in the heavy fermion alloy cecu@xmath12au@xmath13 @xcite where @xmath14 scaling is found at the qcp , indicates that the critical behaviour is associated with very short range fluctuations in contrast with critical phenomena driven by purely thermal fluctuations , where the shorter range fluctuations are only important in so far as they modify the longer range fluctuations .",
    "one conjecture that has been put forward as a basis for a possible theoretical explanation is that the local moments , free from the constraints of the magnetic order , yet not fully screened as in a conventional @xmath15 kondo model , cause singular scattering leading to a breakdown of fermi liquid theory @xcite . such a breakdown can occur in impurity models with a pseudogap at the fermi level",
    "this type of model has been extensively studied as a model which has a local qcp , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "for such a model to explain the observed critical behaviour , however , an explanation would be required for the origin of the pseudogap .",
    "the pseudogap model is not the only form of impurity model , however , that can lead to singular scattering .",
    "it was recognized by coleman and ppin @xcite that the underscreened s - d model has free spins at @xmath0 that can give rise to singular scattering .",
    "the s - d model is underscreened when @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the quantum number of the antiferromagnetically coupled local spin , exceeds the number of conduction electron channels .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of this model have been known for over 20 years from exact bethe ansatz calculations @xcite .",
    "the dynamical behaviour , however , has only been studied recently , and mainly via generalizations to su(n ) versions of the model in the large @xmath5 limit , where mean field methods can be applied together with estimates of the leading gaussian correction terms @xcite .",
    "there has also been some recent nrg work and calculations of the spinon density of states via the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the underscreened s - d model might be realizable for certain quantum dot configurations , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "this possibility has already been considered in a recent preprint , ref .  .",
    "previous nrg calculations for the underscreened models @xcite have been confined to the calculation of the energy levels , using the original wilson procedure @xcite . here",
    "we apply the generalization of nrg approach@xcite to carry out extensive calculations of the dynamical quantities for the one - channel underscreened model for various values of the spin @xmath17 .",
    "we also discuss the model with a ferromagnetically coupled spin for comparison .",

    "we then calculate the spectral densities of the local one - particle green s functions and t - matrices for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath9 in section [ sec : greent ] , the elastic and inelastic scattering cross - sections in section [ sec : scattering ] , and the dynamical spin susceptibilities in section [ sec : spinsus ] . in the final section we review the overall picture that these results give into the physics of this class of impurity models , and discuss the relation between our conclusions and previous work on this topic .    , and in the case of the anderson model the coulomb repulsion @xmath28 acts at the site @xmath29 only.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "as a preliminary to the calculation of the dynamics , we look at the nrg flows and the approach to the fixed point",
    ". this will clarify the nature of the fixed point and the form of the leading correction terms .",
    "for this analysis we use a relatively large value of the nrg discretisation parameter @xmath30 and retain @xmath31 states . due to the slow convergence to the fixed point , we find it necessary to do up to @xmath32 iterations .",
    "we begin the fixed - point analysis with the ferromagnetic case .",

    "the levels are ordered such that @xmath46 and the scaling is such that for @xmath47 @xmath48 is of order 1 and has a finite value @xmath49 in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "the leading correction terms to the fixed point are expected to be the simplest local terms consistent with the symmetry of the model ( see wilson s original paper  @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . in this case",
    "they are expected to be of the same form as the original hamiltonian@xcite , and for the @xmath51 site system can be expressed in the form , @xmath52 an on - site potential scattering term is excluded due to particle - hole symmetry . as @xmath53 describes the excitations relative to the ground state of the uncoupled chain ( @xmath51 sites ) , it has to be normal ordered and written in terms of the single particle and hole operators , using @xmath54 where the coefficients @xmath55 will depend upon @xmath5 .    for the particle excitations only , @xmath53 takes the form @xmath56 there is an additional similar term for the hole excitations , and another one containing combinations of particle and hole excitations .",

    "the energy difference between high - spin and low - spin excitations is given by @xmath68 this difference approaches its fixed point value , which is zero , very slowly , whereas the factor @xmath69 rapidly reaches a finite fixed point value denoted by @xmath70 for @xmath30 .",
