    "numerical studies of hamiltonian su(@xmath0 ) lattice gauge theory in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions have shown that the gauge fields exhibit chaotic behavior in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "the numerical value of the largest positive lyapunov exponent @xmath1 has been obtained for su(2 ) and su(3 ) with the result @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the average energy per plaquette , @xmath4 for su(2 ) , and @xmath5 for su(3 ) . for the su(2 )",
    "gauge theory the complete spectrum of lyapunov exponents was obtained on small lattices @xcite .",
    "these calculations , which follow the evolution of a classical gauge field configuration in minkowski space , also showed that the energy density distribution on the lattice rapidly approaches a thermal distribution @xcite .",
    "this finding confirms the expectation of a finite growth rate of the coarse - grained entropy density of the gauge field , which follows from the observation that the sum over all positive lyapunov exponents at fixed energy density grows like the volume @xcite .",
    "hence , at any given level of coarse - graining , the classical gauge field `` self - thermalizes '' on a time scale of the order of the inverse lyapunov exponent .    in order to determine the value of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath1 , the evolution of the gauge field configurations must be followed over periods @xmath6 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is therefore effectively obtained for gauge fields that are members of a thermal ensemble , and we can identify the average energy per plaquette @xmath3 in ( 1 ) with that of a thermalized lattice . at high temperature",
    "the gauge field is a collection of weakly coupled harmonic oscillators , hence the average energy per independent degree of freedom of the classical gauge field is equal to the temperature @xmath7 , yielding @xmath8 for su(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath9 accounts for the restrictions imposed by gauss law .",
    "we can therefore rewrite the result ( [ 1.1 ] ) as @xmath10 as already noted in @xcite these values for @xmath1 coincide , apart from a factor 2 , with those of the damping rate of a thermal plasmon at rest , obtained by braaten and pisarski @xcite in the framework of thermal perturbation theory : @xmath11 the goal of the present article is to establish this connection and to explain the origin of the factor @xmath12 .",
    "we approach this goal in several steps .",
    "first we review the numerical `` measurement '' of the lyapunov exponent in classical lattice gauge theory .",
    "we point out that the exponential growth rate of a small perturbation in the magnetic energy density used in those calculations is equal to twice of the growth rate of fluctuations in the elementary field variable , in the continuum limit the vector potential .",
    "this explains the factor 2 between @xmath1 and @xmath13 .    in the next step",
    "we demonstrate that in classical calculations the linear perturbation propagation corresponding to the equations of motion of a chaotic dynamical system has in general a fourier spectrum of imaginary frequencies .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is equal to the magnitude of those imaginary frequencies .",
    "then we argue that the chaotic dynamics of the classical system acts like a thermal ensemble averaging the perturbation propagation equation over stochastic frequencies .",
    "the square of these frequencies can either be positive or negative . in this case the damping rate and the plasma frequency of the classical elementary field fluctuations are related to the mean value and the width of the probability distribution of frequency squares .",
    "the final result of these considerations is that the lyapunov exponent as defined in [ 1 ] measures twice the damping rate of classical gauge field fluctuations on the lattice . it is left to show that the quantum field theoretical calculation of the thermal damping rate at rest in hot perturbation theory in the leading @xmath14 order survives in the classical @xmath15 limit .",
    "we begin with the discussion of this point in order to establish connection with thermal quantum field theory .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the derivation of the plasmon damping rate .",
    "nonabelian gauge field fluctuations in a thermal background have been studied extensively in the framework of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the gauge field develops massive collective modes ( plasmons ) with frequency @xmath16 due to interaction with `` hard '' thermal gauge bosons , i.e. excitations with energy of order @xmath7 .",
    "the energy of a plasmon at rest is @xmath17 in su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory . for our purpose",
    "it is important that the dispersion relation @xmath18 can be obtained in the framework of semiclassical transport theory , where classical field fluctuations @xmath19 are coupled to the quantized thermal excitations of the gauge field @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariant description of the collective modes requires the introduction of effective @xmath20-point vertices @xcite , which can be systematically derived from the effective action @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a null four - vector , and the integral is over all directions of the spatial unit vector @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 stands for the gauge - covariant derivative .",
    "we have denoted the collective gauge potential @xmath19 and field strength @xmath25 by lower - case letters to indicate that these describe fluctuations around a thermal background .",
    "note that @xmath26 is a classical construction , with the sole exception that the plasmon rest mass @xmath27 depends on the energy distribution @xmath28 of quantized thermal excitations of the gauge field : @xmath29 at leading order in @xmath30 , ( [ 1.11 ] ) is evaluated for hard thermal quanta with @xmath31 .",
    "braaten and pisarski@xcite showed that the collective plasmon modes are unstable due to the effective interaction ( [ 1.10 ] ) .",
    "the plasmon damping rate @xmath32 is defined as imaginary part of the plasmon pole in the feynman propagator corresponding to decaying plane wave solutions .",
    "the rate of instability for a plasmon at rest can be expressed as the imaginary part of the polarization function of the gauge field at the plasmon pole @xcite : @xmath33 where the transverse polarization function @xmath34 only depends on soft modes described by ( [ 1.10 ] ) .",
    "the plasmon rest mass exactly cancels from the expression ( [ 1.13 ] ) and the result ( [ 1.3 ] ) is a pure number multiplied by @xmath35 , which is a classical inverse length scale .",

    "@xcite ) .    since the effective action ( [ 1.10 ] ) can be derived from classical considerations @xcite , assuming a given spectrum of thermal excitations , it also applies to the collective excitations of the _ classical _ gauge field on a lattice .",
    "the sole modification is that the spectrum of thermal fluctuations is now given by the limit of the bose distribution . denoting the lattice spacing by @xmath37 we find @xmath38 in the weak - coupling , large volume limit .",
    "the plasmon mass ( [ 1.12 ] ) is a purely classical quantity of dimension ( length)@xmath39 not containing @xmath40 , but it diverges in the continuum limit @xmath41 .",
    "this is not surprising , since the lattice spacing serves as a cut - off that is required to regularize the ultraviolet divergences of the classical thermal gauge theory .",
    "the exponential growth rate of small classical field fluctuations is not affected by this divergence because it does not depend on the value of @xmath27 , as mentioned above .",
    "the result ( [ 1.3 ] ) for the plasmon damping rate @xmath13 remains valid if the correct plasmon mass @xmath27 in the effective action ( [ 1.10 ] ) is replaced by the value ( [ 1.12 ] ) for the classical gauge field defined on a lattice .",
    "more intuitively , the independence of @xmath13 from the value of @xmath27 can be understood as follows .",
    "the cross section for scattering of a thermal gluon on a slow plasmon is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the inverse debye color screening length .",

    "the lyapunov exponents measure the growth rate of infinitesimal perturbations around an exact solution of the classical lattice yang - mills equations . since the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath1 was shown to be independent of the lattice spacing , we assume that we can work in the continuum limit whenever adequate . if @xmath46 is an exact solution of the yang - mills equations , the linearized equation for a small perturbation @xmath47 around @xmath48 is @xmath49 = 0 . \\label{1.4}\\ ] ] here @xmath50 $ ] is the gauge covariant derivative where the bracket denotes the lie algebra commutator , and @xmath51 is the field strength tensor associated with the background field @xmath48 .",

    "the classical solution of the equations of motion for field perturbations therefore explores in forward time direction all poles of a free oscillator ( or wave ) equation . in case of chaotic hamiltonian dynamics",
    "the solutions are both exponentially growing and damped giving rise to poles of the laplace transform with positive as well as negative real parts .    making the formal connection between laplace and fourier transformation through a complex rotation of the frequency variable , @xmath76 , the inverse laplace transformation path runs * above * all poles in the complex @xmath77-plane . as a consequence in either case ( oscillatory or chaotic ) the integration path for",

    "the position of all poles of a spectral function can be obtained from the linearized classical equations of motion for field perturbations ( in the leading order of an @xmath40 expansion ) , but the retarded and advanced propagators used to solve scattering problems in perturbative field theory discard the unsuitable ones due to their very definition .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent in hamiltonian ( energy conserving ) dynamical systems , on the other hand , always occurs together with its negative counterpart  liouville s theorem ensures it . therefore studying positive exponential rates gives an information about the position of the poles of damped retarded and advanced propagators as well .",
    "the growth or damping rate , or the oscillation frequency of small amplitude fluctuations in a classical dynamical system is studied by linearizing the classical equations of motion .",
    "this procedure leads to a new differential operator whose spectrum gives the poles of the classical spectral function .",
    "odd parity under time reflection , real valuedness and normalization conditions then determine the relative weights of the pole terms .    the differential operator belonging to the linear perturbation propagation equation ( 10 ) is identical with the second variation of the classical action , @xmath78 $ ] , taken at the background field configuration @xmath79 which is a solution of the classical equation of motion @xmath80=0 $ ] .",

    "so the linear perturbation propagation in classical equations of motion gives information about the saddle point approximated generating functional .",
    "now aiming at the description of long wavelength plasmon damping we may neglect spatial derivatives and write the general form of the classical , linearized perturbation propagation equation ( 10 ) schematically as @xmath82   a(t ) = 0.\\ ] ] the spectrum of this operator contains two poles on the real axis @xmath83 if @xmath84 is a positive constant .",
    "this case , familiar from zero - temperature perturbative field theory , describes small oscillations determining the real poles of the spectral function and the familiar retarded and advanced propagators . in classically chaotic ,",
    "highly excited systems , however , it happens that @xmath84 is negative .",
    "this causes exponentially growing fluctuations  a typical source of chaotic behavior .    in order to gain a qualitative understanding about the ( classical ) spectral function of chaotic systems we consider @xmath84 as a gauss - distributed stochastic variable @xcite .",
    "it can have both negative and positive values , and its time variation is replaced by the ensemble variation due to the ergodic property of classically chaotic dynamical systems discussed in the previous section . in this limit the probability distribution of the frequency squares , @xmath85 , is determined by its two lowest moments , @xmath86 parametrized by two real parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this parametrization reflects the fact that while @xmath89 can either be positive or negative , the width of its distribution is always positive .",
    "the stochastic average of the differential operator for the fluctuations has to be carried out on the quadratic level , because with the gaussian distribution we assumed white noise property of the stochastic quantity .",
    "we get @xmath90 this result exhibits the symmetric four pole structure typical for a spectral function describing classical plasma oscillations @xmath91 yielding the lorentz shape @xmath92 the relative signs of the pole terms follow from the definition of the spectral function as the difference between the advanced and retarded propagators and from its odd time parity @xmath93 the normalization factor @xmath94 ensures that @xmath95 so in each mode exactly one boson is counted by the spectral function @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this particular , four pole spectral function describes a general solution of the stochastically averaged perturbation propagation equation which behaves like @xmath97 after some initial oscillations the exponential growth dominates the long time behavior of @xmath98 .",
    "it is exactly this , which has been seen in numerical calculations .",
    "the conclusion of this argument is that the lyapunov exponent of elementary field fluctuations averaged ergodically is equal to the classical gluon damping rate as expressed by the imaginary part of the pole positions in the spectral function @xmath99 .",
    "we note that in a recent publication @xcite a similar gaussian model for the chaotic instability in general hamiltonian flows has been investigated .",
    "our result presented above recovers the more general one of ref @xcite for vanishing expectation value of the noisy oscillator frequency square ( @xmath100 after substituting a characteristic timescale @xmath101 in the general formula ( 19 ) of ref .",
    "finally we argue again that the leading order gluon damping rate ( 3 ) obtained in hot perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is classical , i.e. it retains its value in the classical limit @xmath102 this fact has been argued before in section ii . here we briefly reconstruct the argument and resolve some technical issues .",
    "this concludes our reasoning about the equality of the lyapunov exponent of chaotic classical lattice gauge theory and the gluon damping rate at rest in a hot plasma .",
    "the gluon damping rate in hot pqcd is obtained from the definition ( 6 ) dividing the imaginary part of the self energy by the thermal gluon mass @xmath103 the general one - loop form of the self energy contains an integral over hard momenta , a factor of @xmath104 and the phase space distribution of thermal gluons @xmath105 where the complicated algebraic expression @xmath106 depends only on scaled momentum variables .",
    "using now the long wavelength approximation the phase space distribution of thermal gluons is replaced with its classical counterpart , @xmath107 leading to @xmath108 scaling the integration variable with the debye mass  which is of quantum origin containing the planck constant  we see that the imaginary part of the 1-loop gluon self energy in a hot plasma is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "it follows that the gluon damping rate obtained using `` classical '' thermal gluons does not depend on the debye mass and planck s constant , @xmath109 showing that the result ( 3 ) is essentially classical .    finally , it is still to show whether non - pole contributions to the self energy in the field theoretical calculation do not interfere with the above arguments .",
    "the one - loop spectral function used there as an input contains a pole term picking up the zeroes @xmath110 of the inverse propagator corresponding to collective plasma modes to the lowest order and a cut term describing the effect of scattering on thermally excited spacelike modes : @xmath111 the cut coefficient @xmath112 is related to the real and imaginary parts of the self energy @xmath113 : @xmath114 the respective self energies for the transverse and longitudinal excitations to leading order in hot perturbative qcd are@xcite @xmath115 and @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 . using these forms",
    "one obtains the following cut parts of the retarded fourier transform of the spectral function , @xmath119 for small @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122 since the integrand is bounded , the cut contribution can not grow exponentially with time and hence does not contribute to the maximal lyapunov exponent ( [ 1.15a ] ) .",
    "in fact , the cut contribution vanishes in the long wavelength limit @xmath123 .",
    "this leaves us with the pole part , which remains finite in this limit .",
    "this concludes our argument establishing a connection between the classical lyapunov exponent and the gluon damping rate in hot perturbative qcd .",
    "we note that some elements of the argument are heuristic , in particular , the replacement of the long - time average of the growth rate of fluctuations around a specific field configuration by the thermal average .",
    "this reasoning assumes that the growth rate , or equivalently the plasmon damping rate , depends only on coarse - grained properties of the gauge field .",
    "we believe that this is so , because the one - loop calculation of the damping rate @xmath13 only involves soft loop momenta @xcite and hence does not depend on details of the short - distance fluctuations of the gauge field .    because of the general nature of our argument",
    ", we conjecture that the complete spectrum of lyapunov exponents obtained in @xcite reflects the spectrum of damping rates @xmath32 of excitations in a thermal bath .",
    "if this were true , it would confirm our assumption that @xmath124 . since",
    ", at present , it is not known whether @xmath32 is a quantity with a classical limit for @xmath125 , the identification with the lyapunov spectrum remains a conjecture .",
    "we finally note that if the correspondence between ergodic and canonical averages holds up for other physical quantities , transport coefficients of nonabelian gauge fields at the classical scale @xmath126 , such as magnetic screening @xcite or color diffusion @xcite , could possibly also be calculated by real - time evolution of classical gauge fields on a lattice .",
