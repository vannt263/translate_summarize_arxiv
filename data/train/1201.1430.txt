    "as shown in the inset , the hybridization between cu(@xmath19 ) and o(@xmath20 ) orbits in overdoped regions are much larger than those in underdoped regions .",
    "this event corresponds to the suppression of the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath17 or the in - plane superexchange interaction @xmath15 , which leads to the disappearance of @xmath41 and the suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "the ground state phase diagram presented here is qualitatively consistent with theoretically predicted ones in terms of either the @xmath13-@xmath14 model   @xcite , or the hubbard model in a strong correlation regime  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : zerot](b ) shows an afm and sc phase diagram predicted by the @xmath13-@xmath14 model with the condition that the second - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath80 is zero @xcite . here ,",
    "values for the vertical axis , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot](b ) are an afm and a sc order parameters , respectively .",
    "@xcite for details on @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "as shown in the figure , the afm order parameter decreases with increasing @xmath37 and vanishes at around @xmath37 @xmath6 0.12 and coexists with the sc order parameter in underdoped regions .",
    "our experimental results demonstrate a good consistency with the @xmath13-@xmath14 model ; we conclude here that the large @xmath15 , which attracts electrons of opposite spins at neighboring sites , is the origin for high-@xmath0 sc .",
    "site - selective cu- and f - nmr studies have unraveled the intrinsic phase diagram of afm and sc in hole - doped cuprates ba@xmath1ca@xmath26cu@xmath27o@xmath28(f , o)@xmath1 ( 02(n-1)nf ) .",
    "the obtained results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the afm metallic state is robust up to the critical hole density @xmath5 for afm orders , and it uniformly coexists with sc .",
    "the @xmath5 for @xmath7-layered compounds , @xmath8 , increases with increasing @xmath7 due to the growth of the interlayer magnetic coupling .",
    "the @xmath8 values are deduced as @xmath9 @xmath6 0.02 @xcite , @xmath10 @xmath6 0.055 @xcite , @xmath69 @xmath6 0.075 @xcite , @xmath70 @xmath6 0.09@xcite , and @xmath11 @xmath6 0.11 . 3 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) takes place around @xmath37 @xmath6 0.16 , which is just outside the quantum critical hole density @xmath75 @xmath6 0.14 to 0.16 .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram of afm and sc is in good agreement with that theoretically predicted by the @xmath13-@xmath14 model@xcite or by the hubbard model in the strong correlation regime  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that those results are accounted for by the _ mott physics _ based on the @xmath13-@xmath14 model . in the physics behind high-@xmath0 phenomena ,",
    "there is a very strong coulomb repulsive interaction @xmath17  ( @xmath836 ev ) , which prohibits the double occupancy of an up - spin electron and a down - spin electron at the same site .",
    "when noting that the strength of @xmath17 is almost unchanged by hole doping , it is considered that the large @xmath15 attracts electrons of opposite spins at neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "the qualitative consistency in the ground - state phase diagram between our experimental results and theoretical ones support the @xmath13-@xmath14 model as a mechanism of high-@xmath0 sc .",
