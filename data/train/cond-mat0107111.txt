    "due to advances of synthesis methods in coordination chemistry @xcite and , especially , in polyoxometalate chemistry,@xcite the field of molecular magnets has undergone rapid progress in recent years . to date",
    "each of the identical molecular magnets contains as few as two and up to several dozens of paramagnetic ions (  spins \" ) .",
    "the largest paramagnetic molecule synthesized , the polyoxometalate @xcite \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } contains 30 iron ions of spin @xmath2 . although these materials are synthesized as macroscopic samples , i.e. crystals or powders , the intermolecular magnetic interactions are generally utterly negligible as compared to the intramolecular interactions .",
    "therefore , measurements of their magnetic properties reflect mainly ensemble properties of single molecules .",
    "it appears that in most cases the magnetic properties of these molecules are rather well described by the heisenberg model with possibly small anisotropy corrections.@xcite    in order to calculate from first principles the energy spectrum and the magnetic properties it is essential to accurately determine the exchange parameters , as these measure the strength of the two - spin interactions .",
    "the usual procedure consists of the following steps : diagonalization of the system hamiltonian for an arbitrary choice of exchange parameters ; calculation of the partition function and a quantity , such as the magnetization , which can be compared to experimental data ; variation of the exchange parameters so as to achieve an optimal fit between the experimental and theoretical data .",
    "this can be a rather straightforward task for simple configurations such as small spin rings with a single nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "however , for more complicated systems , for example where two or more exchange parameters may be needed it may be impractical to perform such calculations for different trial choices of the parameters , even if one is guided by chemical and structural information .",
    "worse yet , for large spin systems , where in practice the hamiltonian can not be diagonalized , it may even be impossible to fix the exchange parameters , since one can not calculate the weak - field susceptibility over the full tempearature range , for comparison with experiment .    in this article",
    "we explore the possibility of determining the exchange parameters of heisenberg molecular magnets using the exactly calculable first three terms of the high - temperature expansion of the zero - field susceptibilty @xmath3 , in powers of @xmath4 . in comparison to earlier work @xcite exact results",
    "are derived here for these three coefficients , for arbitrary coupling , arbitrary single - spin quantum number , and an arbitrary number of spins .",
    "the procedure we explore here opens up the possibility of treating large systems where the hamiltonian can no longer be diagonalized .",
    "we also outline the necessary algorithms for calculating additional terms of the high - temperature expansion , but these would require computer algebra methods .",
    "deducing exchange parameters from experimental susceptibility data of course presumes that one possesses accurate estimates of the number of paramagnetic ions , the spectroscopic splitting factor(s ) , diamagnetic contributions , temperature - independent paramagnetism , etc .",
    "we do not consider these issues here ; instead we concentrate on the question , with what accuracy exchange parameters can be deduced using theoretical susceptibility data , for a heisenberg molecular magnet , limited to the high - temperature regime .",
    "we do not want to mix questions about the accuracy of the method with uncertainties in experimental data which are of different origin .",
    "this article is organized as follows . after recalling basic definitions in sec .",
    "[ sec-2 ] we derive the trace formulae which are necessary for the high - temperature expansion in sec .",
    "[ sec-3 ] .",
    "these results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec-4 ] and related to the expansion coefficients of the taylor series of @xmath3 .",
    "the accuracy and stability of the proposed method are illustrated for two selected model systems in sec .",
    "[ sec-5 ] .",
    "we briefly summarize our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec-6 ] .",
    "for the following investigations we assume that the spin system under consideration is well described by the following general bilinear heisenberg hamilton operator @xmath5 the exchange parameters @xmath6 are given in units of energy , with @xmath7 resulting in ferromagnetic , @xmath8 in antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "@xmath9 are the dimensionless single - particle spin operators and @xmath10 denotes the spin components @xmath11 of the spin at site @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction with the magnetic field is taken into account by including the zeeman term @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath15-component of the total spin operator , and @xmath16 is the spectroscopic splitting factor .",
    "for simplicity we are supposing that all of the paramagnetic ions possess the same value of @xmath16 .",
    "the present results can be easily generalized to cases where several different paramagnetic species are present . as usual the magnetisation",
    "is defined as @xmath17 @xmath18 being the partition function .",
    "accordingly the zero - field magnetic susceptibility is @xmath19 the susceptibility may be renormalised by division of @xmath20 @xmath21 a taylor expansion of @xmath22 in powers of @xmath4 , starting from ( [ 6 ] ) , yields after some calculations @xmath23 where @xmath24 comparing expansion ( [ 17 ] ) with a curie - weiss law @xmath25 yields the known theoretical results @xcite for the curie constant @xmath26 and the weiss temperature @xmath27 @xmath28 generally , the @xmath29-term of ( [ 18 ] ) will not coincide with the @xmath29-term of the rigorous expansion ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the curie - weiss law itself is only valid at high temperatures.@xcite thus , the @xmath29-term of ( [ 17 ] ) constitutes a first ( quantum ) correction to the curie - weiss law for lower temperatures .",
    "expanding the terms occuring in the trace ( [ 8 ] ) @xmath30 and using @xmath31 one ends up with terms of the form @xmath32 here the spin operators @xmath33 without a site index denote operators operating in the single - spin hilbert space @xmath34 .",

    "hence @xmath73 this results in a coefficient @xmath74 and a weiss temperature of @xmath75 which agrees with the mean field result.@xcite      using the same method the next term can be calculated .",
    "the coefficient reads @xmath76 hence @xmath77 depends not on all exchange parameters but only on a certain combination of the second moments ( or correlation coefficients ) of the exchange parameters .",
    "it is clear how coefficients of higher orders are to be calculated , although the expressions rapidly become very lengthy .",
    "computer algebra methods would have to be employed to determine and evaluate those expressions .",
    "the first two expansion coefficients in the taylor expansion ( [ 17 ] ) of the susceptibility in powers of @xmath4 that involve the exchange parameters are @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "we propose exploiting accurate numerical estimates for @xmath78 and @xmath77 to provide information on the exchange parameters . the following version of ( [ 17 ] )",
    "@xmath79 is especially convenient since we can determine @xmath78 and @xmath77 by a least - squares fit between a low degree polynomial in @xmath4 to measured values of the quantity @xmath80 , compare also ref .  .",
    "to increase the accuracy of the determined values of @xmath78 and @xmath77 it is generally advisable to use a polynomial in @xmath4 of degree two or higher . in an iterative procedure one could check the extent to which the values of @xmath78 and @xmath77 change as higher degree polynomials are used",
    "we remind the reader that we assume that the spectroscopic splitting factor @xmath16 , which is necessary to obtain function ( [ 29 ] ) , has accurately been determined , e.g. by esr measurements .    in the following two examples we test the proposed method for two model systems . starting with given exchange parameters we determine the partition function by exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian and calculate the susceptibility .",
    "our aim is to extract accurate estimates for the exchange parameters from a limited number of susceptibility data points .",
    "we also assess how the method depends on the chosen temperature interval and how robust the method is when the experimental data includes random error .",
    "if the system has two exchange parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 it is obvious from ( [ 26 - 2 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) that @xmath78 is a linear function of @xmath81 and @xmath82 whereas @xmath77 is a quadratic function of these variables . hence @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be determined by numerically solving a simple non - linear equation once accurate values of @xmath78 and @xmath77 are available . in cases where multiple solutions exist additional magneto - chemical information , for instance concerning the sign of the exchange parameters , must be considered .",
    "a similar complication arises for the special class of so - called isospectral spin systems , where the same eigenvalue spectrum is associated with a host of different choices of the exchange parameters.@xcite for such systems it is in principle impossible to obtain unique exchange parameters from susceptibility data .",
    "our first model system is a spin array where @xmath83 spins @xmath84 are located at the vertices of a cube .",
    "the spins are assumed to interact via two antiferromagnetic exchange parameters of typical magnitude , @xmath85  k between nearest neighbors in the top and bottom face and @xmath86  k connecting the two faces , see fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] . the calculated magnetic susceptibility is shown in fig .  [ f-2 ] as a thick line .",
    "the thin horizontal line corresponds to the high - temperature limiting value of @xmath87 given by the coefficient @xmath88 , see ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 23 - 2 ] ) . for the determination of the underlying exchange parameters a restricted set of susceptibility data",
    "this set consists of data taken in steps of 5  k from 150  k to 300  k ( crosses in fig .  [ f-2 ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , not the susceptibility @xmath22 itself or @xmath89 are fitted but @xmath90 the graph of the latter function is shown in fig .",
    "one notes that its dependence on @xmath91 in the relevant temperature interval is already rather linear .",
    "therefore one expects good results using the fitting procedure based on a low degree polynomial . indeed , approximating @xmath92 by a polynomial of third order yields @xmath93  k and @xmath94  k ,",
    "a result which is not improved by using polynomials of higher degree .",
    "we also investigated how the chosen temperature interval influences the analysis . including only data between 150  k and 200  k yields exchange parameters which deviate by at most 10  % from the correct values .",
    "different from our model investigation , experimental data necessarily incorporates random noise . in order to estimate this effect ,",
    "the determination of the exchange parameters was carried out with a number of modified data sets . for each data set all susceptibility values",
    "were allowed to deviate by at most @xmath95  % from the correct values .",
    "the resulting exchange parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ f-4 ] , each point corresponding to a different modified data set .",
    "it appears that the influence of the fluctuations is different for the two exchange parameters due to the non - linear dependence of @xmath81 and @xmath82 on the expansion coefficients @xmath96 .      as a second model system",
    "we investigate a ring with @xmath97 and @xmath2 . in order to further quantify the accuracy of the proposed method , we chose two cases , case ( a ) where the spins are connected only by a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath85  k , and case ( b ) where we have an additional next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath86  k , see fig .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath98 , again obtained by complete diagonalization of the hamiltonian , are given in fig .",
    "[ f-6 ] . the thick curve corresponds to case ( a ) and the dashed curve corresponds to case ( b ) .",
    "the thin line again gives the high temperature limit .",
    "data points used for our analysis are depicted by crosses , again within the range between 150 k and 300 k. note that for this model system the data points deviate from the high temperature behavior much more than in the previous example , i.e. the dependence of @xmath99 on @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "[ f-7 ] ) in the above temperature range especially for case ( b ) , is not as linear as it was in the previous example .",
    "the present method is sufficiently robust to provide accurate estimates of the exchange parameters without exploiting any prior information .",
    "this is illustrated by using two exchange parameters for case ( a ) and finding that @xmath100  k and @xmath101  k , which is in very good agreement with the actual exchange parameters in case ( a ) . for case ( b )",
    "we find @xmath102  k and @xmath103  k , which is not as accurate as in the previous examples .",
    "nevertheless , even in this worst case , using these exchange parameters results in @xmath87 which , when plotted in fig .",
    "[ f-6 ] , is indistinguishable for all temperatures from that for the correct values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 . improved exchange parameters might be achievable if measured data for @xmath59 is available for higher temperatures , but unfortunately many substances  especially those containing solvent molecules for instance  become structurally unstable at such temperatures .",
    "in summary , we have provided exact analytical expressions for the first three terms of the high - temperature expansion of the magnetic susceptibility function for heisenberg spin systems with an arbitrary coupling matrix @xmath6 and arbitrary intrinsic spins @xmath104 .",
    "the results can be rather easily used in order to determine unknown exchange parameters for molecular magnets from zero - field magnetic susceptibility data with good accuracy , thereby obviating the need for diagonalizing the system hamiltonian .",
