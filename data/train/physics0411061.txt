    "biomolecular motors are kinds of protein molecules which generate a unidirectional motion in the situation that many surrounding molecules , _",
    "e.g. _ water molecules , collide with the protein molecule many times due to thermal fluctuation@xcite .",
    "they play many essential roles in life ; muscle contraction , transport in cells , _ etc_. it is interesting and important question how motor proteins generate a unidirectional motion .",
    "it is natural to think that they utilize this random fluctuation by the collision , although there has been no unambiguous evidence reported so far that this is essential .",
    "ratchet systems , which take out a net finite current from random and undirected noise , have been intensively investigated for modeling molecular motors@xcite . as known by the famous feynman s lecture@xcite and many investigations thereafter@xcite",
    ", a net finite directed motion is the consequence of the violation of the symmetry of the system , _",
    "e.g. _ the spatial form of the potential . in modeling molecular motors , the system also needs to violate the detailed balance between several different states , _",
    "i.e. _ conformations .",
    "the detailed balance is violated by the undirected chemical energy supply , _",
    "e.g. _ the atp hydrolysis .",
    "ratchet systems are applied to various physical systems other than modeling molecular motors@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 part of the atp synthase is known as a rotatory molecular energy transducer@xcite .",
    "it is embedded in the membrane , and transduces the energy of the transmembrane proton concentration gradient , when a proton passes through the membrane via the @xmath0 part , into that of the rotation of its internal subunits in the motor process .",
    "the ratchet model of it was presented qualitatively by junge , lill and engelbrecht@xcite .",
    "elston , wang , and oster improved this model by taking account of the electrostatic interaction between the residues @xcite .",
    "this ratchet model has an advantage that the coupling between the rotation and the proton flow is easy to see , therefore the energy transduction efficiency is easily estimated . in this model",
    ", there are two important kinds of characteristic time , dynamical and chemical .",
    "the former is the relaxation time of the convection - diffusion system .",
    "the latter are the chemical reaction rates at which a proton binds to or dissociate from the motor protein when it passes through the membrane .",
    "we investigated the efficiency in detail and pointed out that in the motor process , the inequalities between them affect the behavior of it @xcite .",
    "for the motor to work most efficiently , certain inequalities between them need to hold .",
    "the @xmath0 part also works as a pump@xcite ; it gains energy from the ( inverse ) rotation and pumps out protons against the transmembrane proton gradient .",
    "which process this protein adopts , motor or pump , under a given condition and what controls this determination are important questions , but satisfying answers to these have not been obtained so far .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the physical quantities in the pump process , such as the rotation velocity , the proton pumping rate , and the energy transduction efficiency .",
    "the condition under which the protein works as a pump with higher efficiency is discussed .",
    "we will compare the most efficient condition for the pump process with that for the motor process .",
    "the atp synthase is schematically shown in fig.[fo](a ) .",
    "the upper side of the figure is the basic ( inner ) side of the cell and the lower side is the acidic ( outer ) side .",
    "the proton concentration of the acidic side is kept higher than that of the basic side by respiratory chains .",
    "the @xmath0 part is composed of the subunits denoted by the roman letters , * a * , * b * , and * c * , and the @xmath1 part by the greek letters , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . the rotating ring ( the * c*-ring)is composed of the assembly of the * c*-subunits , each of which has a proton binding site , carboxyrate asp61 , almost in the middle of itself .",
    "the * a*-subunit is fixed in the membrane .",
    "the proton channel is the interface between the * a*-subunit and the * c*-ring .",
    "there are two * c*-subunits and two proton paths in the channel .",
    "one of the paths connects the left binding site of the * c*-subunits to the basic side and the other connects the right binding site to the acidic side .",
    "the other * c*-subunits are in the membrane",
    ". the proton binding site can be both protonated and unprotonated only if it is in the channel .",
    "otherwise it can be only protonated due to the hydrophobicity of the membrane .",
    "the conformational change of the * c*-subunits between the two states , protonated and unprotonated , is small@xcite and we neglect the effect on the place of the binding sites .",
    "the states of the * c*-ring are determined by protonations of the two proton binding sites in the channel ; the empty(e ) state with the both binding sites unprotonated , the right(r ) state with the right binding site protonated and the left binding site unprotonated , the left(l ) state with the left binding site protonated and the right binding site unprotonated , and the full(f ) state with the both binding sites protonated . as a motor",
    "the * c*-ring rotates rightward and as a pump leftward in fig.[fo ] .",
    "the @xmath4- subunit connects the @xmath0 part to the @xmath1 part .    , and the * c*-ring ) rotate . in the pump process",
    ", the external load force from @xmath1 rotates the * c*-ring in the direction of the arrow and pumps out a proton from the upper to the lower side .",
    "this direction of rotation is opposite to that in the motor process . in the lower figures ,",
    "( b ) , the states of the * c*-ring are shown .",
    "the rectangle frame is the proton channel viewed from the * a*-subunit and the shaded region is the * c*-ring .",
    "the states depend on the protonations of the two proton binding sites in the channel .",
    "the figure ( a ) corresponds to the r - state .",
    "[ fo],width=283 ]    we investigate this system by using the simply biased diffusion model @xcite .",
    "it works as follows : the * c*-ring moves randomly by collision with surrounding molecules and is forced to rotate by the external load from the @xmath1 part .",
    "but the hydrophobic interaction prevents the unprotonated binding site from moving into the membrane , _",
    "i.e. _ the e and r states can not move leftward out of the channel and the e and l states not rightward .",
    "if the chemical reaction rates , at which a proton binds to or dissociates from the binding sites in the channel , are tuned appropriately , it becomes possible to take out a net motion against the load or to pump protons against the concentration gradient .",
    "we consider the pump process of this system .",
    "a proton passes through the channel from the basic side to the acidic side as follows : first a proton in the basic side flows into the channel and binds to the left binding site .",
    "next the proton goes through the membrane with the leftward rotation of the * c*-ring .",
    "finally the proton comes back to the channel , dissociates from the right binding site , and flows out to the acidic side .",
    "in this way , a proton is pumped out by the rotation of the * c*-ring driven by the external load , which is gained by the energy of the atp hydrolysis in the external part .",
    "we assume that in the pump process , the external load exerted is larger than that in the motor process , so that the * c*-ring can rotate leftward . in this sense",
    ", the external load should be exactly called driving force of the rotation in the pump process .",
    "however , we will use the term load in the pump process since we deal with the same model as in the motor process .",
    "first of all , we give a qualitative consideration of the energy transduction , the coupling between the rotation and the proton flow . the good process in the channel",
    "is shown in fig.[good ] : a proton binds to the left binding site in the left figure .",
    "then the * c*-ring moves one step leftward in the center figure .",
    "finally the proton bound to the right binding site dissociates in the right figure and the process returns back to the start . in this process one step of the * c*-ring rotation corresponds to one proton pumping .",
    "this is the efficient energy transduction .",
    "a bad process is shown in fig.[bad1 ] . in the upper - right figure",
    ", a proton binds to the left binding site before the proton bound to the right binding site dissociates .",
    "then in the lower - right figure , the * c*-ring moves leftward without proton dissociation",
    ". therefore more than one step of the rotation corresponds to one proton pumping . in this process",
    "the energy is transduced inefficiently .",
    "another bad process is shown in fig.[bad2 ] . in the upper - middle figure",
    ", a proton binds to the right binding site from the acidic side before the rotation of the * c*-ring .",
    "next the * c*-ring rotates leftward in the upper - right figure .",
    "finally the proton bound to the left binding site dissociates then the * c*-ring rotates rightward due to diffusion . in this process",
    ", a proton passes through the membrane along the gradient , in the undesirable direction , without net step of the * c*-ring .",

    "firstly , the inequality @xmath85 is required to suppress the bad process shown in fig.[bad2 ] .",
    "if the inequality is not satisfied , the left binding site in the channel becomes unprotonated before the relaxation by the fluctuation hence it can not move into the membrane . as a result the bad process in fig.[bad2 ] can occur easily .",
    "secondly , the inequality @xmath86 indicates that the bad process shown in fig.[bad1 ] , rotation without proton pumping , rarely occurs .",
    "thirdly , the inequality @xmath87 , which distinguishes the case 1 ) from 2 ) , is needed to prevent the * c*-ring from moving rightward .    for @xmath88",
    ", we note that it is determined in highly nontrivial manners . to see this ,",
    "let us go back to eq.([eff ] ) . as we see in figs.[v45]-[nh55 ] , both the numerator of eq.([eff ] ) , which is proportional to the proton pumping rate @xmath53 , and the denominator , which is proportional to the rotation velocity @xmath89 and the load @xmath59 , increase monotonically as the load increases .",
    "therefore , the subtle difference between the increasing rates of them determines @xmath88 .",
    "we have investigated the pump process of the ratchet model of the rotatory molecular motor . the model can be solved analytically and the physical quantities such as the rotation velocity and the proton pumping rate are calculated .",
    "the energy transduction efficiency is obtained from these physical quantities .",
    "the best efficiency condition is that the set of inequalities @xmath90 holds under an optimal value of the load @xmath88 .",
    "we compare the result obtained here with that for the motor process .",
    "in ref.@xcite we find that the most efficient condition for the motor process is that the set of inequalities @xmath91 holds , under the experimentally reported load , @xmath79 40pn@xmath80 nm @xcite .",
    "the set of inequalities required between the chemical reaction rates coincide with that for the pump process obtained here .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 part can work both as a motor and a pump efficiently by tuning the load @xmath59 . in this sense",
    "these conditions are consistent .    as far as we know ,",
    "experiments which directly measures the physical quantities , such as the rotation velocity and the pumping rate , have not been reported so far . however an experiment has been reported that in a whole @xmath92 atp synthase the conformational change of one subunit of @xmath1 part suppresses electronically and/or sterically the rotation hydrolysing atp@xcite .",
    "this effect may be interpreted to vary the load effectively and control which process occurs .    in the model we considered here ,",
    "only the diffusion process is taken into account .",
    "the highest efficiency obtained is @xmath930.3 , and it seems to be not high enough , since molecular motors are thought to transduce energy almost without loss @xcite .",
    "there are several possibilities to solve this problem .",
    "the first is to reconsider the definition of the efficiency ( [ eff ] ) , since our definition , following the argument in ref.@xcite , is different from that in ref.@xcite .",
    "the second is to reconsider the relations between physical quantities appropriate near the equilibrium , such as the einstein s relation , since the system is far from equilibrium .",
