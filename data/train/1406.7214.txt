    "the study of insulating topological states of matter has emerged as an intensely active field of research . for non - interacting systems",
    "there is a variety of topological states which have been identified and subsequently classified based on their elementary symmetries @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example of this kind are the integer quantum hall insulator states @xcite .",
    "many other symmetry protected topological insulator states , such as for instance quantum spin hall systems or three dimensional @xmath0 topological insulators have been identified theoretically @xcite and also experimentally realized @xcite .    the _ entanglement spectrum _ ( es ) @xcite has attracted substantial attention as a theoretical tool to characterize and identify topological states . given a partition of the system into parts 1 and 2 , the entanglement spectrum is ( the negative logarithm of ) the spectrum of the reduced density matrix of part 1 , which is obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom of part 2 from the density matrix corresponding to the system ground state . ref .",
    "@xcite introduced the notion that the es for a topological state contains a representation of the physical edge modes . even though the system may not possess an edge ( e.g. , due to periodic boundary conditions ) , the cut separating the partitions serves as a virtual edge for the es .",
    "this notion is important and relevant both for interacting topological states like fractional quantum hall states and spin liquids @xcite and for non - interacting topological states @xcite .",
    "the entanglement spectrum can be regarded as the spectrum of a ` hamiltonian ' that has support on part 1 .",
    "this entanglement hamiltonian can be thought of as possessing some of the properties of the physical hamiltonian of the system , albeit with a boundary due to the restriction to part 1 .",
    "when the system ground state is topological , the entanglement hamiltonian is argued to also be a hamiltonian with topological properties , and since part 1 has a boundary , the es can be expected to display an edge mode .",
    "the general properties of the entanglement hamiltonian , and the physical content of the es , are not completely understood and remain a topic of active research .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the entanglement spectrum of a two - dimensional chern insulator on a cylinder geometry , i.e. , on a system having periodic boundary conditions in one spatial direction but not in the other , similar to ref . @xcite .",
    "in such a system , there are _ physical _ chiral edge modes , in addition to the virtual edge modes present in the es .",
    "we consider cuts parallel to the edges . by varying the distance to the edge",
    ", this setup allows us to study the interplay of the physical edge modes and the partitioning .",
    "in particular , when the smaller partition is small enough , the entanglement hamiltonian should encode the physics of a single ( virtual ) chiral edge mode .",
    "this is a rather unusual opportunity , because chiral edge modes generally occur in pairs .",
    "we demonstrate that , when the cut is near enough to the edge so that the edge modes spatially cross the cut , the es generically becomes gapped .",
    "this is analogous to topological matter on a thin strip , when the physical edge modes on opposite edges have the opportunity to hybridize and produce a gap in the spectrum .",
    "we use a chern insulator model for which the localization of the boundary modes can be parametrically tuned , in particular , they can be made to localize sharply at the physical edge . at such special points , we find that the es remains gapless , containing a single chiral channel , even when the cut is such that the partition contains only a single row at the edge",
    ".    partitioning the system , such that the smaller subsystem contains only a single row , yields an effectively one - dimensional system . since the es has a chiral channel , the entanglement hamiltonian must correspond to a 1d chiral hamiltonian , accomplished by complex long - ranged hopping . in this article , we study the properties of such entanglement hamiltonians and argue that their ground states carry a so - called ` persistent current ' @xcite .",

[ [ outline ] ] outline  + + + + + + + + +    in section [ sec : mandm ] , we introduce the tunable model hamiltonian we consider , and provide the definitions we use for the entanglement spectrum and the entanglement hamiltonian .",

    "the generic behavior , exemplified by choosing the mass parameter @xmath42 is shown in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : mdep ] .",
    "we observe that there seems to be one gapless mode connecting the lower and upper bands when the cut is far away from the physical edge , i.e. , when the number of rows @xmath43 in the smaller partition is significantly larger than 1 .",

    "[ fig : mdep ]",
    ". the aforementioned gap in the entanglement spectrum does not open , even for @xmath44 , i.e. , even if the cut is performed in the row adjacent to the system edge where the physical edge state is hosted .",
    "this happens since for this special value of the mass parameter the edge state is not localized _ exponentially _ at the physical edge , but instead _ exactly _ , which can be traced back to the flat dispersion of the lower edge of the bulk spectrum , shown in fig .",

    "we note that the hamiltonian corresponding to the entanglement spectrum seemingly supports a single chiral channel realized in a one dimensional model .",

    "the reduced correlation matrix is a hermitian matrix and thus can be used to define a one - dimensional hopping hamiltonian @xmath48 . in the following this hamiltonian will be denoted as the entanglement hamiltonian .",
    "this is a minor abuse of notation as the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath49 is defined by instead .",

    "note that we can always reconstruct the full many - body entanglement spectrum from the eigenvalues of @xmath48 , implying that all the information about the system is already captured in the correlation matrix .",

    "the absolute values of the hopping amplitudes for large distances are well described by @xmath55 .",
    "when the system is in the trivial regime , however , the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian is always short - ranged .",

    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : escylinder ] that for @xmath16 the enanglement spectrum is not gapped even if the cut is performed in the row adjacent to the physical edge mode .",

    "this seems contradictory to the fermion doubling theorem for systems with chiral and translational symmetry  @xcite , but the way out is via long - range hoppings ( @xmath61 ) which effectively mimics a higher dimensional system .",
    "let us now discuss what happens when magnetic flux is threaded through the cylinder .",
    "this can be done in several , inequivalent ways .",
    "following ref .",
    "the flux can be inserted in the original hamiltonian . in this scenario ,",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath62 flux insertion , but the correlation matrix ( and hence the entanglement hamiltonian ) are not , because the ground state evolves into an excited state . under flux insertion the spectrum of the correlation matrix changes such that effectively one state is transported from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ( or vice versa depending on the direction of the flux ) , but all other states transform into each other . despite this change in the correlation matrix ( and hence the entanglement spectrum ) the authors of ref .",
    "concluded that the entanglement spectrum shows spectral flow .",
    "however , when considering the correlation matrix as a hopping hamiltonian , we can also insert flux in this effective hamiltonian .",
    "this is not equivalent to the scheme explained above , because in this case , the spectrum has to be invariant under @xmath65 flux insertion . in particular , we are interested how the flux insertion affects the spectrum at the fine - tuned points @xmath23 , where the entanglement spectrum appears gapless with a single chiral channel .",
    "the appearance of a single chiral channel is worrisome as it suggests that a level can be transported upon flux insertion from the lower to the upper band , while the reverse process is not possible .",
    "this implies that the system can not go back to itself upon adiabatic insertion of flux @xmath62 if the upper and the lower band are indeed connected .",
    "consequently , the existence of a chiral channel must be deceiving .",
    "this can be seen most clearly when the mass parameter @xmath66 .",
    "when the cut approaches the edge , i.e. the entanglement hamiltonian becomes more and more one - dimensional , a gap opens in the entanglement spectrum . in this case",
    ", adiabatic flux insertion is expected to act separately on the upper and lower band and there is no spectral flow in the entanglement spectrum . at",
    "the special points the situation is more intriguing since there is no gap in the entanglement spectrum and a more thorough analysis of the effects of flux insertion is needed in order to determine whether or not adiabatic level transport between the bands is possible .    a consistent way to introduce flux in expression and",
    "is by changing the boundary conditions from periodic to @xmath67 .",
    "the correlation matrix is written as a sum over the hopping range @xmath53 : @xmath68 and the boundary condition is consequently applied every time @xmath69 .",
    "the factor @xmath70 in the second line is needed to avoid double - counting . in this setup",

    "<S> we study the entanglement spectrum of a chern insulator on a cylinder geometry , with the cut separating the two partitions taken parallel to the cylinder edge , at varying distances from the edge . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to similar studies on a torus , there is only one cut , and hence only one virtual edge mode in the entanglement spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement spectrum has a gap when the cut is close enough to the physical edge of the cylinder such that the edge mode spatially extends over the cut . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is suppressed for parameter choices where the edge mode is sharply localized at the edge . in the extreme case of a perfectly localized edge mode , </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement spectrum is gapless even if the smaller partition consists of a single edge row . for the single - row cut </S>",
    "<S> , we construct the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian , which is a one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian with complex long - range hopping and interesting properties . </S>",
    "<S> we also study and explain the effect of two different schemes of flux insertion through a ring described by such an entanglement hamiltonian . </S>"
