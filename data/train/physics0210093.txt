    "@xcite    the programing of the brain consists of the making or breaking of synapses ( or more generally of the modification of the weights of the synapses ) .",
    "certain programing occurs at critical periods ( such as the breaking of synapses to obtain registration of the images seen by the right and left eyes@xcite ) and programing that occurs throughout the lifetime ( such as storing information in the long - term memory ) .",
    "many brain processes occur at the same time : parallel computation is widespread .",

    "a block diagram is shown in figure [ memory ] .",
    "the stimuli from the environment arrive at our sense organs where they are transformed into electro - chemical impulses in neurons .",
    "this information is processed and analyzed hierarchically in the sensory registers , and in the lapse of about one quarter of a second are either discarded ( if they are not interesting ) or passed on to the short - term memory .",
    "this is the '' : at a party we can pay attention to one conversation , unaware of other conversations until our name ( or some gossip of interest ) is mentioned .",
    "the short - term memory can store a limited amount of information : about seven random letters , or five random words , or four random phrases , or one low resolution image .",
    "after up to eight to twenty seconds this information is discarded ( forgotten ) unless it is of our interest and we refresh the memory by repetition ( as when we are given a new telephone number ) .",
    "we can transfer information from the short - term memory to the long - term memory .",
    "this transfer requires that the information be classified and related to other information in the long - term memory .",

    "the long - term memory can store practically an unlimited amount of information which lasts for a life time ( it seems that the information is lost only by disease or death ) .",
    "we are aware of , or can pay attention to , a limited amount of information .",

    "conscience of the environment emerges in the child as he or she acquires experience . according to piaget , before the first month of age the reflexes lack will . from one to eight months of age",
    "the child successively learns to repeat voluntarily actions that cause him pleasure , acquires the intention of his actions , searches for hidden objects , and acquires long - term goals .",
    "self - consciousness emerges around the eighteenth month of age when the child recognizes himself in the mirror ( seeing in the mirror that he has a spot painted on the nose he reaches his nose ) . at about the age of twenty four months",
    "the child distinguishes the words `` and '' .",
    "so the brain is in constant development .",
    "the following is a simplified model of memory and recognition that fits the observations described in section 2 .",
    "the model distinguishes two types of neurons according to their different connections and hence different functions .",
    "i will call these neurons `` and '' .",
    "when i see an event , each quality of the event ( shape , movement , color , distance , sound , smell ... ) is processed in parallel , each in hierarchical form . at the top level of these hierarchies",
    "are image neurons .",
    "when i see the event , image neurons all over the cerebral cortex fire . in figure [ image_neuron ]",
    "are shown three image neurons that fire in response to a particular external stimulus .",
    "the sub - set of image neurons that fires will be called an \" .",
    "the crucial question is this one : how can image neurons that fire all over the cerebral cortex synchronize their pulses ?    to answer this question we introduce a memory neuron as shown in figure [ memory_neuron ] .",
    "the unprogramed memory neuron has its dendrites and its axon connected to many image neurons .",
    "the memory neuron becomes programed and encodes an image as follows .",
    "the memory neuron breaks the synapses of its dendrites and axon to the image neurons that are * not * firing .",
    "see figure [ programed_neuron ] .",
    "this breaking of synapses is the storage of the image into the long - term memory .",
    "each memory neuron can store one image .",
    "( it is important to mention that similar programing of neurons has been studied in kittens before the age of three months when the excess of synapses are broken to obtain registered binocular vision.@xcite ) from the experiments we speculate that the programing of a memory neuron takes of order @xmath2 second .",
    "the memory neuron serves three functions : recognition , short - term memory , and long - term memory as we now explain .",
    "if i see the same event again , most of the same image neurons fire .",
    "this will cause the `` to '' the image and fire .",
    "this is how we recognize events .",
    "the firing of the memory neuron in turn * reinforces , synchronizes and completes * the firing of the image neurons involved in the perception .",
    "thus a positive feedback loop is established .",
    "even when the stimulus is removed the neurons keep firing in synchronism ( at about @xmath3 pulses per second@xcite ) due to the positive feedback loop of the memory neuron . the threshold of the memory neuron raises ( or , equivalently",
    ", the coupling weight of the synapses is reduced ) so that after up to eight to twenty seconds the oscillation ceases . according to the model ,",
    "this is the mechanism of short - term memory .",
    "examples of the brain completing images are the filling in of the blind spot , the coloring of periferal vision and the completion of a square .    if , for some reason , the memory neuron is excited , then the image neurons involved in the perception of the event fire in synchronism .",
    "the memory neuron `` this event , fires , and establishes a positive feedback loop .",
    "self sustaining synchronized pulses occur for a few seconds .",
    "this is how the event is retrieved from the long - term memory and is '' or \" in the short - term memory .",
    "there is a hierarchy of memory neurons , so that if i see a dog coming towards me i first recognize a dog in general , and then i recognize the special dog snoopy .",
    "the dog in general corresponds to a particular set of image neurons firing in synchronism .",
    "snoopy corresponds to those same image neurons plus additional image neurons all firing in synchronism .",
    "a simple hierarchy is shown in figure [ hierarchy ] .    in section 2",
    "we mentioned that to transfer information from the short - term memory to the long - term memory it is necessary to classify it and relate it to other information already in the long - term memory .",
    "this classification and relation is the construction of the hierarchy of memory neurons such as the case shown in figure [ hierarchy ] . according to the model , this is the learning process .",
    "we propose that there are memory neurons that recognize parts of images , _",
    "e.g. _ a square , a face , the visual image of a letter , the sound of a word , the smell of a rose ...    consider figure [ image_neuron ] again .",
    "i see an external event through my senses . as a result ,",
    "image neurons all over my cerebral cortex fire .",
    "this firing is not in synchronism ( yet ) .",
    "the qualities of the event ( shape , movement , color , sound ... ) have not been related with each other .",
    "no memory neuron has recognized the image yet .",
    "after a few hundred milliseconds memory neurons * recognize * the image , these memory neurons fire and synchronize the pulses of the image neurons all over the cerebral cortex .",
    "positive feedback loops have been closed .",
    "the qualities of the event have been * related with each other*. the perception of the image no longer needs input from the senses since the positive feedback is * self - sustaining * for the next few seconds . because the memory neurons form part of a hierarchy , the information of the image has been * related to other knowledge * in the long - term memory .",
    "the image may now become conscious .",
    "if the feedback loops are prevented from oscillating we loose consciousness .",
    "general anesthesia `` consciousness by acting on the synapses .",
    "likewise , the '' , located near the hypothalamus , regulates the couplings at the synapses .    when a feedback loop oscillates we may become conscious of the corresponding image . the threshold of the memory neuron rises ( or equivalently the coupling at the synapses is weekend ) so that after a few seconds the oscillation is no longer self - sustaining . then another memory neuron that codes a * related * image ( and is therefore close to threshold ) can begin oscillating , perhaps with the aid of input from the senses or noise .",
    "thus * one image in conscience leads to a related image*. this is the \" .",
    "the following are rough order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "we humans have about @xmath4 neurons .",
    "our eyes have @xmath5 rods and cones .",
    "the retina , which is part of the brain@xcite , processes the visual information so that \" @xmath6 axons connect the retina to the ( rest of the ) brain .",
    "further processing will reduce this number .",
    "so a rough estimate of the number of image neurons ( including all senses ) is of order @xmath1 .",
    "this number is of the same order as the maximum number of dendrites of a neuron .",
    "a very rough estimate of the number of memory neurons is obtained as follows : assume a memory neuron is programed , _",
    "i.e. _ an image is stored into long - term memory , every @xmath7 seconds ( the duration of short - term memory ) for a lifetime .",
    "the corresponding number of memory neurons is of order @xmath5 .",
    "let us now consider a bee .",
    "it has of order @xmath6 neurons .",
    "the bee has eyes with a total of @xmath8 facets .",
    "after processing , we will need perhaps @xmath9 image neurons for all senses .",
    "if @xmath10 of the bees neurons are memory neurons then they can store up to @xmath1 images in long - term memory .",
    "so a worker bee that lives , say , six months , can store into memory about one image every minute or so .",
    "the bee will have some degree of consciousness .",
    "the feedback loops shown in figure [ hierarchy ] account for many observations on recognition , short - term memory , long - term memory and the learning process , and shed some light on consciousness .",
    "we propose that some implementation of those feed back loops is wide spread in the cerebral cortex .",
    "we have not touched on the difficult questions : how does feeling ( such as pain ) arise from the firing of neurons ?",
    "how do i become aware ? can a silicon neural network feel pain and become aware of itself ? does our attention wander randomly from one image to a related one , or do we have some control on our point of attention ?"
