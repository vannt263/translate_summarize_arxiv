    "recent advances in observational cosmology have brought us closer to a fundamental understanding of the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "observations of variations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the sky have yielded a consistent picture in which gravitational instability drives primordial fluctuations to condense into large - scale structures , such as our own galaxy . moreover ,",
    "quantum field theory and general relativity provide an elegant microphysical mechanism , _ inflation _ , for generating these primordial perturbations during an early period of accelerated expansion .",
    "the classical dynamics of this inflationary era @xcite explains the large - scale homogeneity , isotropy and flatness of the universe , while quantum fluctuations during inflation lead to small inhomogeneities .",
    "the general properties of the spectrum of inflationary inhomogeneities were predicted long ago @xcite and are in beautiful agreement with recent cmb observations , e.g.  by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite .",
    "although inflation is remarkably successful as a phenomenological model for the dynamics of the very early universe , a detailed understanding of the physical origin of the inflationary expansion has remained elusive . in this review",
    "we will highlight specific aspects of inflation that depend sensitively on the ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of quantum field theory and gravity , i.e.  on the field content and interactions at energies approaching the planck scale .",
    "such issues are most naturally addressed in a theory of planck - scale physics , for which string theory is the best - developed candidate .",
    "this motivates understanding the physics of inflation in string theory .",
    "inflation may be defined as a period of exponential expansion of space , @xmath0 which arises if the universe is dominated by a form of stress - energy that sources a nearly - constant hubble parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this requirement for accelerated expansion can be fulfilled by a range of qualitatively different mechanisms with varied theoretical motivations @xcite . for concreteness",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the simple case of single - field slow - roll inflation , where the inflationary dynamics is described by a single order parameter @xmath2 ( a fundamental scalar field or a composite field ) with canonical kinetic term @xmath3 and potential energy density @xmath4 .",
    "prolonged accelerated expansion then occurs if the _ slow - roll _ parameters are small @xmath5 where the primes denote derivatives with respect to the inflaton field @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to smoothing the universe on large scales , inflation stretches quantum fluctuations of light degrees of freedom ( @xmath6 ) , creating a spectrum of small perturbations in the observed cmb temperature and polarization .",
    "these perturbations are the key to structure formation and to tests of inflation , so we pause to explain them ; see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion .    in inflationary scenarios with a single inflaton field ,",
    "the light degrees of freedom during inflation are the inflaton itself and the two polarization modes of the graviton .",
    "fluctuations of the inflaton lead to perturbations of the time at which inflation ends , and hence source perturbations in the energy density after inflation .",
    "these fluctuations are visible to us as anisotropies in the cmb temperature .",
    "both the inflaton ( _ scalar _ ) fluctuations and the graviton ( _ tensor _ ) fluctuations source polarization of the cmb photons . ref .",
    "@xcite made the important observation that the spin-2 polarization field of the cmb photons may be decomposed into two distinct scalar or spin-0 modes :    * _ @xmath7-mode _ : this curl - free mode is characterized by polarization vectors that are radial around cold spots and tangential around hot spots on the sky , and is generated by both scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "@xmath7-mode polarization and its cross - correlations with the cmb temperature fluctuations were first detected by dasi @xcite and have recently been mapped out in greater detail by wmap @xcite . * _ @xmath8-mode _ : this divergence - free mode is characterized by polarization vectors with vorticity around any point on the sky .",
    "primordial @xmath8-modes can only be produced by gravitational waves and are therefore considered an unambiguous signature of inflationary tensor perturbations .",
    "the energy scale of inflation determines the amplitude of tensor perturbations , and hence the @xmath8-mode amplitude , so that a detection would fix the inflationary energy scale .",
    "the search for primordial @xmath8-modes is a key effort of observational cosmology @xcite .",
    "the nature of the inflationary epoch is imprinted on the sky in the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cmb . in slow - roll inflation , small @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 ensure that the spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations are nearly scale - invariant .",
    "the shapes of the primordial perturbation spectra are therefore intimately tied to the inflationary background dynamics as dictated by the shape of the inflaton potential @xmath4 .",
    "cmb observations have improved dramatically in the past decade , and near - future experiments will almost certainly continue this trend .",
    "temperature anisotropies have been measured at the cosmic variance limit over a large range of scales , and experimentalists are now preparing for precision measurements of the polarization of the cmb @xcite",
    ". a detection of inflationary tensor perturbations via their unique @xmath8-mode signature would be especially interesting , as their amplitude relates directly to the energy scale of inflation .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity to probe physics at energies near the gut scale , far out of reach of terrestrial collider experiments .      besides the intellectual satisfaction of providing a microscopic description of the inflationary process , there are more detailed motivations for studying inflation in the context of string theory .",
    "while inflation is frustratingly effective at making most signatures of high - energy physics unobservable , e.g.  by exponentially diluting any pre - existing density of gut - scale relics , the duration and the details of inflation are nevertheless sensitive to certain aspects of planck - scale physics . in the remainder of this review we flesh this out in more detail , but we now briefly preview two examples of the uv sensitivity of inflation that will be central to our discussion .      from a top - down perspective the flatness of the inflaton potential in planck units , as quantified by the slow - roll conditions , eq .",
    "( [ equ : sr ] ) , is a nontrivial constraint . as we will show in  [ sec : uv ] , small ( planck - suppressed ) corrections to the potential often induce important corrections to the curvature of the potential , @xmath11 . to assess whether inflation can nevertheless occur requires detailed information about planck - suppressed corrections to the inflaton potential .",
    "this requires either phenomenological assumptions , or preferably microphysical knowledge , about physics at the planck scale .",
    "string theory equips us to compute such corrections from first principles , and in  [ sec : case ] we give an example of such an analysis for the case of warped d - brane inflation @xcite .      as we explain in  [ sec : large ] , the uv sensitivity of inflation is particularly strong in models with observable gravitational waves .",
    "a large gravitational wave signal from inflation is associated with a high energy scale for the inflaton potential and a super - planckian variation of the inflaton field , @xmath12 , between the time when cmb fluctuations were created and the end of inflation . in  [",
    "sec : large ] we explain why theoretical control of the shape of the potential over a super - planckian range requires certain assumptions about the uv structure of the theory .",
    "models of large - field inflation are therefore most naturally studied in a uv - complete theory , such as string theory . in  [ sec : tensors ] we present the first controlled examples of large - field inflation in string theory @xcite .",
    "given the exciting possibility of measuring the gravitational wave signature of inflation in the polarization of the cmb , the issue of controlled large - field inflation is of both theoretical and experimental relevance @xcite .",
    "inflation in string theory is the subject of close to 1,000 papers , and space considerations prevent us from presenting a truly comprehensive review that summarizes and assesses each important class of models .",
    "( some representative contributions to the subject include @xcite ; we refer the reader to the reviews @xcite for a more complete list of references . ) instead , our goal is an exposition of what we believe to be the primary theme of the subject : the sensitivity of inflation to planck - scale physics . as we will explain ,",
    "this is the two - way connection by which string theory can clarify inflationary model - building , and cosmological experiments can constrain string theory models . to illustrate this idea in depth",
    ", we focus on two case studies : _ warped d - brane inflation _ and _ axion monodromy inflation_. these two scenarios are instructive examples from the general classes of small - field and large - field inflation , respectively .",
    "as a phenomenon in quantum field theory coupled to general relativity , inflation does not appear to be natural .",
    "in particular , the set of lagrangians suitable for inflation is a minute subset of the set of all possible lagrangians .",
    "moreover , in wide classes of models , inflation emerges only for rather special initial conditions , e.g.  initial configurations with tiny kinetic energy , in the case of small - field scenarios .",
    "although one would hope to explore and quantify the naturalness both of inflationary lagrangians and of inflationary initial conditions , the question of initial conditions appears inextricable from the active yet incomplete program of understanding measures in eternal inflation @xcite .",
    "( however , see e.g.  @xcite for recent efforts to quantify or to ameliorate the fine - tuning of initial conditions . ) in this review we will focus on the question of how ( un)natural it is to have a lagrangian suitable for inflation .    for a single inflaton field with a canonical kinetic term",
    ", the necessary conditions for inflation can be stated in terms of the inflaton potential .",
    "inflation requires a potential that is quite flat in planck units ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ : sr ] ) ) , and as we now argue , this condition is sensitive to planck - scale physics .",
    "let us recall that the presence of some form of new physics at the planck scale is required in order to render graviton - graviton scattering sensible , just as unitarity of @xmath13-@xmath13 scattering requires new physics at the @xmath14 scale .",
    "although we know that new degrees of freedom must emerge , we can not say whether the physics of the planck scale is a finite theory of quantum gravity , such as string theory , or is instead simply an effective theory for some unimagined physics at yet higher scales .",
    "however , the structure of the planck - scale theory has meaningful  and , in very favorable cases , testable ",
    "consequences for the form of the inflaton potential .    as usual",
    ", the effects of high - scale physics above some cutoff @xmath15 are efficiently described by the coefficients of operators in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "integrating out particles of mass @xmath16 gives rise to operators of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the mass dimension of the operator .",
    "sensitivity to such operators is commonplace in particle physics : for example , bounds on flavor - changing processes place limits on physics above the @xmath14 scale , and lower bounds on the proton lifetime even allow us to constrain gut - scale operators that would mediate proton decay .",
    "however , particle physics considerations alone do not often reach beyond operators of dimension @xmath19 , nor go beyond @xmath20 .",
    "( scenarios of gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking are one exception . )",
    "equivalently , planck - scale processes , and operators of very high dimension , are irrelevant for most of particle physics : they decouple from low - energy phenomena .    in inflation",
    ", however , the flatness of the potential in planck units introduces sensitivity to @xmath21 _ planck - suppressed _ operators , such as @xmath22 as we explain in  [ sec : eta ] , an understanding of such operators is required to address the smallness of the eta parameter , i.e.  to ensure that the theory supports at least 60  @xmath23-folds of inflationary expansion . this sensitivity to dimension - six planck - suppressed operators is therefore common to all models of inflation .    for large - field models of inflation",
    "the uv sensitivity of the inflaton action is dramatically enhanced . as we discuss in  [ sec : large ] , in this important class of inflationary models the potential becomes sensitive to an _",
    "infinite _ series of operators of arbitrary dimension .      in the absence of any specific symmetries protecting the inflaton potential , contributions to the lagrangian of the general form = ^2 are allowed .",
    "if the dimension - four operator @xmath24 has a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) comparable to the inflationary energy density , @xmath25 , then this term corrects the inflaton mass by order @xmath1 , or equivalently corrects the eta parameter by order one , leading to an important problem for inflationary model - building .",
    "let us reiterate that contributions of this form may be thought of as arising from integrating out planck - scale degrees of freedom . in this section",
    "we discuss this so - called _ eta problem _ in effective field theory ,  [ sec : higgs ] , and illustrate the problem in a supergravity example ,  [ sec : sugraeta ] .",
    "in a generic effective theory with cutoff @xmath15 , the mass of a scalar field runs to the cutoff scale unless it is protected by some symmetry .",
    "since the cutoff for an effective theory of inflation is at least the hubble scale , @xmath26 , this implies that a small inflaton mass ( @xmath27 ) is radiatively unstable .",
    "equivalently , the eta parameter receives radiative corrections , = 1 , preventing prolonged inflation .",
    "the difficulty here is analogous to the higgs hierarchy problem , but supersymmetry does not suffice to stabilize the inflaton mass : the inflationary energy necessarily breaks supersymmetry , and the resulting splittings in supermultiplets are of order @xmath1 , so that supersymmetry does not protect a small inflaton mass @xmath27 .    in  [ sec : tensors ] we discuss the natural proposal to protect the inflaton potential via a shift symmetry @xmath28 , which is equivalent to identifying the inflaton with a pseudo - nambu - goldstone - boson . in the absence of such a symmetry",
    "the eta problem seems to imply the necessity of fine - tuning the inflationary action in order to get inflation .",
    "an important instance of the eta problem arises in locally - supersymmetric theories , i.e.  in supergravity @xcite .",
    "this case is relevant for many string theory models of inflation because four - dimensional supergravity is the low - energy effective theory of supersymmetric string compactifications .    in @xmath29 supergravity , a key term in the scalar potential",
    "is the f - term potential , [ equ : fterm ] v_f = e^k / m_pl^2 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the khler potential and the superpotential , respectively ; @xmath32 is a complex scalar field which is taken to be the inflaton ; and we have defined @xmath33 . for simplicity of presentation , we have assumed that there are no other light degrees of freedom , but generalizing our expressions to include other fields is straightforward .",
    "the khler potential determines the inflaton kinetic term , @xmath34 , while the superpotential determines the interactions . to derive the inflaton mass ,",
    "we expand @xmath35 around some chosen origin , which we denote by @xmath36 without loss of generality , i.e.  @xmath37 .",
    "the inflationary lagrangian then becomes @xmath38 where we have defined the canonical inflaton field @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we have retained the leading correction to the potential originating in the expansion of @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : fterm ] ) , which could plausibly be called a universal correction in f - term scenarios .",
    "the omitted terms , some of which can be of the same order as the terms we keep , arise from expanding @xmath42 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ equ : fterm ] ) and clearly depend on the model - dependent structure of the khler potential and the superpotential .",
    "the result is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ equ : o6 ] ) with _ 6 = v_0 |and implies a large model - independent contribution to the eta parameter [ equ : sugraeta ] = 1 , as well as a model - dependent contribution which is typically of the same order .",
    "it is therefore clear that in an inflationary scenario driven by an f - term potential , eta will generically be of order unity .    under",
    "what circumstances can inflation still occur , in a model based on a supersymmetric lagrangian ?",
    "one obvious possibility is that the model - dependent contributions to eta approximately cancel the model - independent contribution , so that the smallness of the inflaton mass is a result of fine - tuning . in the case study of  3",
    "we will provide a concrete example in which the structure of all relevant contributions to eta can be computed , so that one can sensibly pursue such a fine - tuning argument .",
    "clearly , it would be far more satisfying to exhibit a mechanism that _ removes _ the eta problem by ensuring that @xmath43 .",
    "this requires either that the f - term potential is negligible , or that the inflaton does not appear in the f - term potential .",
    "the first case does not often arise , because f - term potentials play an important role in presently - understood models for stabilization of the compact dimensions of string theory @xcite .",
    "however , in ",
    "[ sec : tensors ] we will present a scenario in which the inflaton is an axion and does not appear in the khler potential , or in the f - term potential , to any order in perturbation theory .",
    "this evades the particular incarnation of the eta problem that we have described above .",
    "it is a famous fact that the quantum theory of strings is naturally defined in more than four spacetime dimensions , with four - dimensional physics emerging upon compactification of the additional spatial dimensions .",
    "for concreteness , we will focus on compactifications of the critical ten - dimensional type iib string theory on six - dimensional calabi - yau spaces ( to be precise , our compactifications will only be conformal to spaces that are well - approximated by orientifolds of calabi - yau manifolds , but we will not need this fine point . )",
    "the vast number of distinct compactifications in this class are distinguished by their topology , geometry , and discrete data such as quantized fluxes and wrapped d - branes .",
    "a central task in string theory model - building is to understand in detail how the ten - dimensional sources determine the four - dimensional effective theory .",
    "if we denote the ten - dimensional compactification data by @xmath44 , the procedure in question may be written schematically as [ equ : s10s4 ] s_10[c ] _ 4 .",
    "distinct compactification data @xmath44 give rise to a multitude of four - dimensional effective theories @xmath45 with varied field content , kinetic terms , scalar potentials , and symmetry properties . by understanding the space of possible data @xmath44 and the nature of the map in eq .",
    "( [ equ : s10s4 ] ) , we can hope to identify , and perhaps even classify , compactifications that give rise to interesting four - dimensional physics .      for our purposes ,",
    "the most important degrees of freedom of the effective theory are four - dimensional scalar fields .",
    "scalar fields known as _ moduli _ arise from deformations of the compactification manifold , typically numbering in the hundreds for the calabi - yau spaces under consideration , and from the positions , orientations , and gauge field configurations of any d - branes . from given compactification data",
    "one can compute the kinetic terms and scalar potentials of the moduli ; in turn , the expectation values of the moduli determine the parameters of the four - dimensional effective theory . in the presence of generic ten - dimensional sources of stress - energy , such as d - branes and quantized fluxes , there is an energy cost for deforming the compactification , and many ( though not always all ) of the moduli fields become massive @xcite .",
    "it is useful to divide the scalar fields arising in @xmath45 into a set of light fields @xmath46 with masses below the hubble scale ( @xmath47 ) and a set of heavy fields @xmath48 with masses much greater than the hubble scale ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "here one of the light fields , denoted @xmath2 , has been identified as the inflaton candidate .    to understand whether successful inflation can occur",
    ", one must understand all the scalar fields , both heavy and light .",
    "first , sufficiently massive moduli fields are effectively frozen during inflation , and one should integrate them out to obtain an effective action for the light fields only , _ 4 ( , , ) _ 4 , eff ( , ) .",
    "integrating out these heavy modes generically induces contributions to the potential of the putative inflaton : that is , _ moduli stabilization contributes to the eta problem_. this is completely analogous to the appearance of corrections from higher - dimension operators in our discussion of effective field theory in  [ sec : eft ] .    next",
    ", if scalar fields in addition to the inflaton are light during inflation , they typically have important effects on the dynamics , and one should study the evolution of all fields @xmath50 with masses @xmath51 . moreover",
    ", even if the resulting multi - field inflationary dynamics is suitable , light degrees of freedom can create problems for late - time cosmology .",
    "light scalars absorb energy during inflation and , if they persist after inflation , they can release this energy during or after big bang nucleosynthesis , spoiling the successful predictions of the light element abundances .",
    "moreover , light moduli would be problematic in the present universe , as they mediate fifth forces of gravitational strength . to avoid these late - time problems",
    ", it suffices to ensure that @xmath52 , as in this case the moduli decay before big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "a simplifying assumption that is occasionally invoked is that all fields aside from the inflaton should have @xmath53 , but this is not required on physical grounds : it serves only to arrange that the effective theory during inflation has only a single degree of freedom .",
    "in string theory models of inflation the operators contributing to the inflaton potential can be enumerated , and in principle even their coefficients can be computed in terms of given compactification data . to illustrate these issues , it is useful to examine a concrete model in detail . in the following",
    "we therefore present a case study of a comparatively well - understood model of small - field inflation , _ warped d - brane inflation_.      in this scenario inflation is driven by the motion of a d3-brane in a warped throat region of a stabilized compact space @xcite . to preserve four - dimensional lorentz ( or de sitter ) invariance",
    ", the d3-brane fills our four - dimensional spacetime and is pointlike in the extra dimensions ( see figure [ fig : throat ] ) .",
    "the global compactification is assumed to be a warped product of four - dimensional spacetime ( with metric @xmath54 ) and a conformally - calabi - yau space , [ equ : metric ] s^2 = e^2a(y ) g _ x^x^+ e^-2a(y )",
    "g_mn y^m y^n , with @xmath55 a calabi - yau metric that can be approximated in some region by a cone over a five - dimensional einstein manifold @xmath56 , g_mn",
    "y^m y^n = r^2 + r^2 s_x_5 ^ 2 .",
    "a canonical example of such a throat region is the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) geometry @xcite , for which @xmath56 is the @xmath57 coset space @xmath58 , and the would - be conical singularity at the tip of the throat , @xmath59 , is smoothed by the presence of appropriate fluxes .",
    "the tip of the throat is therefore located at a finite radial coordinate @xmath60 , while at @xmath61 the throat is glued into an unwarped bulk geometry . in the relevant regime",
    "@xmath62 the warp factor may be written as @xcite [ equ : warp ] e^-4a(r ) = , r^4 ( g_s m )^2 , where . here , @xmath63 and @xmath35 are integers specifying the flux background @xcite .",
    "warping sourced by fluxes is commonplace in modern compactifications , and there has been much progress in understanding the stabilization of the moduli of such a compactification @xcite .",
    "positing a stabilized compactification containing a ks throat therefore seems reasonable given present knowledge .",
    "inflation proceeds as a d3-brane moves radially inward in the throat region , towards an anti - d3-brane that is naturally situated at the tip of the throat .",
    "the inflaton kinetic term is determined by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action for a probe d3-brane , and leads to an identification of the canonical inflaton field with a multiple of the radial coordinate , @xmath64 .",
    "here , @xmath65^{-1}$ ] is the d3-brane tension , with @xmath66 the string coupling and @xmath67 the inverse string tension .",
    "the exit from inflation occurs when open strings stretched between the approaching pair become tachyonic and condense , annihilating the branes .",
    "in this simplified picture , inflation is driven by the extremely weak ( warping - suppressed ) coulomb interaction of the brane - antibrane pair @xcite .",
    "the true story , however , is more complex , as moduli stabilization introduces new terms in the inflaton potential which typically overwhelm the coulomb term and drive more complicated dynamics @xcite .",
    "this pattern is precisely what we anticipated in our effective field theory discussion : integrating out moduli fields can be expected to induce important corrections to the potential .",
    "an important correction induced by moduli stabilization is the inflaton mass term arising from the supergravity f - term potential ,  [ sec : sugraeta ] . in a vacuum stabilized by an f - term potential ,",
    "i.e.  by superpotential terms involving the moduli , one finds the mass term @xmath68 @xcite , where @xmath69 is an arbitrary reference value for the inflaton field and the parameter @xmath70 should not be confused with the present - day hubble constant .",
    "however , one expects additional contributions to the potential from a variety of other sources , such as additional effects in the compactification that break supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath71 to encapsulate all contributions to the potential aside from the coulomb interaction @xmath72 and the mass term @xmath73 ; then the total potential and the associated contributions to the eta parameter may be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 because the coulomb interaction is very weak .",
    "( more generally , @xmath76 can be _ defined _ to be all terms in @xmath4 with negligible contributions to @xmath10 .",
    "besides the brane - antibrane coulomb interaction , this can include any other sources of nearly - constant energy , e.g.  bulk contributions to the cosmological constant . )    clearly , @xmath10 can only be small if @xmath77 can cancel the mass term in eq .",
    "( [ equ : vphi ] ) .",
    "we must therefore enumerate all relevant contributions to @xmath77 , and attempt to understand the circumstances under which an approximate cancellation can occur .",
    "note that identifying a subset of contributions to @xmath77 while remaining ignorant of others is insufficient .",
    "warped d - brane inflation has received a significant amount of theoretical attention in part because of its high degree of computability . quite generally , if we had access to the full data of an explicit , stabilized compactification with small curvatures and weak string coupling , we would in principle be able to compute the potential of a d - brane inflaton to any desired accuracy , by performing a careful dimensional reduction .",
    "this is not possible at present for a generic compact calabi - yau , for two reasons : for general calabi - yau spaces hardly any metric data is available , and examples with entirely explicit moduli stabilization are rare .",
    "however , a sufficiently long throat is well - approximated by a _",
    "noncompact _ throat geometry ( i.e. , a throat of infinite length ) , for which the calabi - yau metric can often be found , as in the important example of the klebanov - strassler solution @xcite , which is entirely explicit and everywhere smooth . having complete metric data greatly facilitates the study of probe d - brane dynamics , at least at the level of an unstabilized compactification .",
    "furthermore , we will now explain how the effects of moduli stabilization and of the finite length of the throat can be incorporated systematically .",
    "the method involves examining perturbations to the supergravity solution that describes the throat in which the d3-brane moves . for concreteness we will work with the example of a ks throat , but the method is far more general . our treatment will allow us to give explicit expressions for the correction terms @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : vphi ] ) , and hence to extract the characteristics of inflation in the presence of moduli stabilization .        above we gave the explicit solution for the noncompact warped throat region",
    "we now describe a systematic way to estimate the leading corrections to the throat solution as perturbations to the geometry and fluxes at large @xmath78 ( near @xmath79 in figure [ fig : throat ] ) .",
    "we then consider the effect of these perturbations on the potential for a d3-brane at a location well inside the throat .",
    "before we can explain the idea underlying this approach , we need a few facts about the coupling of d3-branes to the background fields of type iib supergravity , which is the low - energy limit of type iib string theory .",
    "type iib supergravity contains a metric , which in the background takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ equ : metric ] ) , as well as various @xmath80-form fields .",
    "importantly , the four - dimensional potential @xmath81 as a function of the d3-brane position in the extra dimensions is only affected by a very specific combination of background fields : v= t_3 ( e^4a - ) t_3 _ - , where @xmath82 is the potential for the five - form field f_5 = ( 1+_10 ) , and @xmath83 is the ten - dimensional hodge star . the d3-brane potential is therefore dictated by the profile of @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath85 vanishes in the unperturbed ks throat , and more generally in the class of flux compactifications considered by giddings , kachru , and polchinski ( gkp ) @xcite .",
    "finally , the einstein equations and five - form bianchi identity imply that perturbations of @xmath85 around such backgrounds satisfy , at the linear level , the six - dimensional laplace equation @xcite , [ equ : laplace ] ^2 _ - = 0 .    in a general compactification , little",
    "is known about the solution for @xmath86 , and one can therefore draw few general conclusions about the d3-brane potential . however , in a noncompact throat geometry , one can often solve the laplace equation .",
    "moreover , the potential for a d3-brane in a throat that is glued into an arbitrary compact calabi - yau must be expressible in terms of a solution for @xmath86 in the throat , i.e.  in terms of a superposition of harmonic functions .    as this is the crucial idea , let us repeat : no matter how complicated the calabi - yau to which the throat is attached , it must be possible to express the d3-brane potential via some @xmath86 profile in the throat , as @xmath86 is the only supergravity field that sources a d3-brane potential .",
    "moreover , for a sufficiently long but finite throat , the @xmath86 profile is given to an excellent approximation by a solution of the laplace equation in the noncompact throat geometry .",
    "( corrections are expected to be exponentially small when the throat is long . )",
    "thus , the structure of the inflaton potential is dictated by the structure of solutions of the laplace equation in the noncompact throat .",
    "let us therefore solve the laplace equation ( [ equ : laplace ] ) in the ks background .",

    "the flatness of the inflaton potential needs to be controlled _ dynamically _ over a super - planckian field range .",
    "we discuss this challenge in effective field theory in ",
    "[ sec : eft ] and in string theory in ",
    "[ sec : tensors ] .      to begin ,",
    "let us consider super - planckian field excursions in the context of wilsonian effective field theory .      in the absence of any special symmetries ,",
    "the potential in large - field inflation becomes sensitive to an infinite series of planck - suppressed operators .",
    "the physical interpretation of these terms is as follows : as the inflaton expectation value changes , any other fields @xmath48 to which the inflaton couples experience changes in mass , self - coupling , etc . in particular ,",
    "any field coupled with at least gravitational strength to the inflaton experiences significant changes when the inflaton undergoes a super - planckian excursion .",
    "these variations of the @xmath48 masses and couplings in turn feed back into changes of the inflaton potential and therefore threaten to spoil the delicate flatness required for inflation .",
    "note that this applies not just to the light ( @xmath151 ) degrees of freedom , but even to fields with masses near the planck scale : integrating out planck - scale degrees of freedom generically ( i.e. , for couplings of order unity ) introduces planck - suppressed operators in the effective action . for nearly all questions in particle physics ,",
    "such operators are negligible , but in inflation they play an important role .    the particular operators which appear are determined , as always , by the symmetries of the low - energy action . as an example , imposing only the symmetry @xmath152 on the inflaton leads to the following effective action : _ eff ( ) = -()^2 - m^2 ^2 - ^4 - _ p=1^ ( ) ^2p+  unless the uv theory enjoys further symmetries , one expects that the coefficients @xmath153 and @xmath154 are of order unity .",
    "thus , whenever @xmath2 traverses a distance of order @xmath155 in a direction that is not protected by a suitably powerful symmetry , the effective lagrangian receives substantial corrections from an infinite series of higher - dimension operators . in order to have inflation",
    ", the potential should of course be approximately flat over a super - planckian range .",
    "if this is to arise by accident or by fine - tuning , it requires a conspiracy among infinitely many coefficients , which has been termed ` functional fine - tuning ' ( compare this to the eta problem ,  [ sec : eta ] , which only requires tuning of one mass parameter ) .",
    "there is a sensible way to control this infinite series of corrections : one can invoke an approximate symmetry that forbids the inflaton from coupling to other fields in any way that would spoil the structure of the inflaton potential . such a shift symmetry",
    ", @xmath156 protects the inflaton potential in a natural way .",

    "however , because we require that this symmetry protects the inflaton even from couplings to planck - scale degrees of freedom , it is essential that the symmetry should be approximately respected by the planck - scale theory  in other words , the proposed symmetry of the low - energy effective action should admit a uv - completion .",
    "hence , large - field inflation should be formulated in a theory that has access to information about approximate symmetries at the planck scale .",
    "let us remark that in effective field theory in general , uv - completion of an assumed low - energy symmetry is rarely an urgent question .",
    "the present situation is different because we do _ not _ know whether all reasonable effective actions can in fact arise as low - energy limits of string theory , and indeed it has been conjectured that many effective theories do not admit uv - completion in string theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to verify that any proposed symmetry of planck - scale physics can be realized in string theory .    to construct an inflationary model with detectable gravitational waves ,",
    "we are therefore interested in finding , in string theory , a configuration that has both a large kinematic range , and a potential protected by a shift symmetry that is approximately preserved by the full string theory .",
    "we now turn to our second case study , an example of large - field inflation in string theory .",
    "as we have just discussed , the particular challenge in these models is the need to control an infinite series of contributions to the inflaton potential , arising from couplings of the inflaton to degrees of freedom with masses near the planck scale .",
    "direct enumeration and fine - tuning of such terms ( as in the small - field example in  [ sec : case ] ) is manifestly impractical , and it appears essential to develop a symmetry argument controlling or forbidding these terms .",
    "an influential proposal in this direction is natural inflation @xcite , in which a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( i.e. , an axion ) is the inflaton . at the perturbative level",

    "we should therefore search in string theory for an axion with decay constant @xmath163 .",

    "it is therefore essential to verify that the continuous shift symmetry which protects the inflaton potential is preserved to an appropriate degree by the stabilized compactification .",
    "for the special case of moduli stabilization in which nonperturbative effects play a role , ensuring that the shift symmetry is not spoiled can be quite subtle .",
    "we will now explain this point , but readers less interested in the details can skip to  [ sec : axions ] .",
    "we first observe that a continuous shift symmetry @xmath195 forbids all non - derivative terms in the effective action for @xmath186 , but does not constrain terms involving only the spacetime derivative @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , the shift symmetry is unbroken to the extent that all non - derivative terms are constrained to vanish .",
    "we now check this criterion in the example of interest by recalling the classic dine - seiberg treatment @xcite of axion shift symmetries in string theory .",
    "dine and seiberg proved that to any order in perturbation theory ( in the absence of d - branes ) , the effective action for the axion @xmath186 can only be a function of @xmath197 , i.e.  @xmath186 has a shift symmetry . to show this",
    ", they observed that the zero - momentum coupling of @xmath186 ( corresponding to non - derivative terms ) is a total derivative on the worldsheet , and hence vanishes when the worldsheet has no boundary and wraps a topologically trivial cycle in spacetime .",
    "their argument proceeds as follows .",
    "the two - form @xmath8 couples to the worldsheet as @xcite [ equ : dine ] _ ^2 ^_x^_x^b_(x ) , where @xmath198 are the spacetime coordinates and @xmath199 are two - dimensional string worldsheet coordinates ; i.e.  eq .  ( [ equ : dine ] ) is the pullback of @xmath8 onto the worldsheet .",
    "if @xmath8 is imagined to be a constant in spacetime , then the above coupling is a total derivative on the worldsheet .",
    "equivalently , the _ zero - momentum _ portion of the axion effective action in spacetime arises from a total - derivative term on the string worldsheet .",
    "( in general backgrounds , @xmath8 is not constant , but it is the coupling of the constant portion of @xmath8 that governs zero - momentum terms in the four - dimensional effective action . )    hence , if the string worldsheet has no boundary and is topologically trivial , the zero - momentum coupling of the axion @xmath186 must vanish , and the axion therefore can not have any non - derivative couplings .",
    "thus , as long as the worldsheet has no boundary , the axion has no non - derivative couplings to any order in sigma - model perturbation theory ( i.e. , the perturbation theory of the quantum field theory living on the string worldsheet , whose coupling constant is the inverse spacetime curvature in units of @xmath200 ) , because worldsheets wrapping nontrivial curves in the ten - dimensional spacetime contribute only nonperturbatively , as worldsheet instantons .",
    "however , closed string worldsheets _ can _ develop boundaries in the presence of d - branes , on which the strings can break and end .",
    "therefore , in a compactification without d - branes , the shift symmetry of @xmath186 is preserved to all orders in perturbation theory , while in a compactification containing d - branes , the shift symmetry can be violated .      in the present setting ,",
    "we have deliberately invoked d5-branes , in order to produce a monodromy in the potential .",
    "however , provided that this potential , which we identified with the inflaton potential , is the _ leading _ effect breaking the shift symmetry , the resulting structure is technically natural .",
    "although this sounds promising , in the case of the @xmath186 axion there is in fact an additional ingredient which also breaks the axion shift symmetry .",
    "khler moduli stabilization is accomplished , in a well - studied class of models @xcite , by the inclusion of nonperturbative effects , e.g.  from euclidean d3-branes ( d3-brane instantons ) .",
    "such effects can circumvent the dine - seiberg argument given above , because euclidean d - branes are nonperturbative effects and provide boundaries for string worldsheets .",
    "we will now sketch the specific difficulty presented by euclidean d3-branes , referring the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details . supposing for simplicity that there is only one khler modulus , @xmath201 , the superpotential is of the form @xmath202 , where the exponential term is the euclidean d3-brane contribution . at the energy scales in question ,",
    "@xmath203 and @xmath204 are constants depending on the stabilized values of the complex structure moduli and of the dilaton .",
    "furthermore , the khler potential takes the form @xcite @xmath205 , with @xmath206 a constant depending on the intersection numbers of the compactification and on the stabilized value of the dilaton .",
    "although a shift of @xmath186 can be compensated in the khler potential by a shift of @xmath207 , the superpotential is then not invariant .",
    "clearly , the continuous shift symmetry is broken by the nonperturbative superpotential term generated by euclidean d3-branes .",
    "euclidean d3-branes therefore make important contributions to the potential of @xmath186 , and in fact generate an eta problem .",
    "one can easily verify @xcite that this is precisely analogous to the eta problem in d3-brane inflation .",
    "the situation may seem discouraging , because even a shift symmetry that was valid to all orders in perturbation theory has turned out to be inadequate to protect the inflaton potential !",
    "however , we will now find an even more potent symmetry in the case of the @xmath208 axion .",
    "although the ns axion @xmath186 and the rr axion @xmath208 have many shared features , a crucial distinction is that @xmath208 couples to d1-branes , via the electric coupling [ equ : ccouple ] _ c , but does _ not _ couple directly to d3-branes ( or to d3-brane instantons ) that carry vanishing d1-brane charge .",
    "thus , if the moduli are stabilized exclusively by instantons to which @xmath208 does not couple , even nonperturbative moduli stabilization will not violate the shift symmetry of @xmath208 .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a description of compactifications in which this mechanism is operative .",
    "these considerations suggest the following scenario . instead of a wrapped d5-brane introducing a potential for a @xmath186 axion , we consider a wrapped ns5-brane that provides a potential for a @xmath208 axion . even in the presence of nonperturbative stabilization of the khler moduli",
    ", such an axion can enjoy the protection of a shift symmetry over a super - planckian range .",
    "the corresponding inflationary scenario is natural in the technical sense .      in  [ sec : large ] we showed that an observable gravitational wave signal correlates with the inflaton field moving over a super - planckian distance during inflation .",
    "effective field theory models of large - field inflation then require a shift symmetry to protect the flatness of the potential over a super - planckian range .",
    "it has therefore become an important question whether such shift symmetries arise in string theory and can be used to realize large - field inflation .    in this section",
    ", we argued that the first examples of shift symmetries in string theory that protect the potential over a super - planckian range are becoming available .",
    "we explained the dual role of the monodromy : i ) it results in a large kinematic field range @xmath149 by allowing a small fundamental domain to be traversed repeatedly , and ii ) in combination with the shift symmetry it controls corrections to the potential over a super - planckian range .",
    "the shift symmetry , only weakly broken by @xmath81 , controls corrections @xmath77 within a fundamental domain , and furthermore relates corrections in one fundamental domain to those in any other .",
    "monodromy therefore effectively reduces a large - field problem to a small - field problem @xcite .",
    "although more work is required to understand these models and the compactifications in which they arise , monodromy appears to be a robust and rather promising mechanism for realizing large - field inflation , and hence an observable gravitational wave signal , in string theory .",
    "as we hope this review has illustrated , theoretical progress in recent years has been dramatic .",
    "a decade ago , only a few proposals for connecting string theory to cosmology were available , and the problem of stabilizing the moduli had not been addressed .",
    "we now have a wide array of inflationary models motivated by string theory , and the best - studied examples among these incorporate some information about moduli stabilization .",
    "moreover , a few mechanisms for inflation in string theory have been shown to be robust , persisting after full moduli stabilization with all relevant corrections included .    aside from demonstrating that inflation is possible in string theory , what has been accomplished ?",
    "in our view the primary use of explicit models of inflation in string theory is as test cases , or toy models , for the sensitivity of inflation to quantum gravity . on the theoretical front",
    ", these models have underlined the importance of the eta problem in general field theory realizations of inflation ; they have led to mechanisms for inflation that might seem unnatural in field theory , but are apparently natural in string theory ; and they have sharpened our understanding of the implications of a detection of primordial tensor modes .",
    "it is of course difficult to predict the direction of future theoretical progress , not least because unforeseen fundamental advances in string theory can be expected to enlarge the toolkit of inflationary model - builders .",
    "however , it is safe to anticipate further gradual progress in moduli stabilization , including the appearance of additional explicit examples with all moduli stabilized ; entirely explicit models of inflation in such compactifications will undoubtedly follow . at present , few successful models exist in m - theory or in heterotic string theory ( however , see e.g.  @xcite et seq . ) , and under mild assumptions , inflation can be shown to be impossible in certain classes of type iia compactifications @xcite . it would be surprising if it turned out that inflation is much more natural in one weakly - coupled limit of string theory than in the rest , and the present disparity can be attributed in part to the differences among the moduli - stabilizing tools presently available in the various limits .",
    "clearly , it would be useful to understand how inflation can arise in more diverse string vacua .",
    "the inflationary models now available in string theory are subject to stringent theoretical constraints arising from consistency requirements ( e.g. , tadpole cancellation ) and from the need for some degree of computability . in turn , these limitations lead to correlations among the cosmological observables , i.e.  to predictions",
    ". some of these constraints will undoubtedly disappear as we learn to explore more general string compactifications .",
    "however , one can hope that some constraints may remain , so that the set of inflationary effective actions derived from string theory would be a proper subset of the set of inflationary effective actions in a general quantum field theory .",
    "establishing such a proposition would require a far more comprehensive understanding of string compactifications than is available at present .",
    "the theoretical aspects of inflation described in this review are interesting largely because they can be _ tested _ experimentally using present and future cosmological data . in order to describe this connection , we will very briefly review recent achievements and near - future prospects in observational cosmology .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , of the distribution of galaxies on the sky , and of the redshift - luminosity relations of type ia supernovae have transformed cosmology into an exact science .",
    "this has revealed a strange universe filled with 73% dark energy , 23% dark matter , and only 4% baryons .",
    "in addition , we now have a firm qualitative understanding of the formation of large - scale structures , like the cosmic web of galaxies , through the gravitational instability of small primordial fluctuations .",
    "the perturbation spectrum that forms the seeds of these structures is found to be nearly ( but not exactly ) scale - invariant , nearly gaussian , and adiabatic @xcite , precisely as predicted by the simplest models of inflation @xcite .",
    "future observations will dramatically extend our knowledge of the primordial fluctuations , probe further details of the inflationary paradigm , and allow us to constrain or exclude a considerable fraction of the proposed scenarios for inflation .",
    "the planck satellite will measure the temperature anisotropies of the cmb with unprecedented accuracy over a large range of scales ; in combination with small - scale cmb experiments ( e.g.  act @xcite and spt @xcite ) this will provide crucial information on deviations of the scalar spectrum from scale - invariance , gaussianity and adiabaticity .",
    "cmb polarization experiments from the ground ( e.g.  clover @xcite , quiet @xcite , and bicep @xcite ) and from balloons ( e.g.  ebex @xcite and spider @xcite ) promise to provide the first significant constraints on inflationary tensor perturbations",
    ". a planned cmb polarization satellite ( cmbpol @xcite ) would be designed to be sensitive enough to detect @xmath8-modes down to a tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath209 , thereby including all models of large - field inflation ( @xmath149 ) .      the most dramatic confirmation of inflation would come from a detection of @xmath8-mode polarization , which would establish the energy scale of inflation and would indicate that the inflaton traversed a super - planckian distance .",
    "as we have argued in this review , super - planckian displacements are a key instance in which the inflaton effective action is particularly sensitive to the physics of the planck scale . as a concrete example of the discriminatory power of tensor perturbations ,",
    "any detection of primordial gravitational waves would exclude the warped d3-brane inflation scenario of  3 @xcite , while an upper bound @xmath210 ( or a detection with @xmath211 ) would exclude the axion monodromy scenario of  5 @xcite .",
    "a further opportunity arises because single - field slow - roll inflation predicts null results for many cosmological observables , as the primordial scalar fluctuations are predicted to be scale - invariant , gaussian and adiabatic to a high degree .",
    "a detection of non - gaussianity , isocurvature fluctuations or a large scale - dependence ( running ) would therefore rule out single - field slow - roll inflation .",
    "inflationary effective actions that do allow for a significant non - gaussianity , non - adiabaticity or scale - dependence often require higher - derivative interactions and/or more than one light field , and such actions arise rather naturally in string theory .",
    "although we have focused in this review on the sensitivity of the inflaton potential to planck - scale physics , the inflaton kinetic term is equally uv - sensitive , and string theory provides a promising framework for understanding the higher - derivative interactions that can produce significant non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "finally , cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies induced by relic cosmic strings or other topological defects provide probes of the physics of the end of inflation or of the post - inflationary era .",
    "cosmic strings are automatically produced at the end of brane - antibrane inflation @xcite , and the stability and phenomenological properties of the resulting cosmic string network are determined by the properties of the warped geometry .",
    "detecting cosmic superstrings via lensing or through their characteristic bursts of gravitational waves is an exciting prospect .",
    "recent work by many authors has led to the emergence of robust mechanisms for inflation in string theory .",
    "the primary motivations for these works are the sensitivity of inflationary effective actions to the ultraviolet completion of gravity , and the prospect of empirical tests using precision cosmological data .",
    "string theory models of inflation have now achieved a reasonable level of theoretical control and are genuinely falsifiable by observational data . indeed , many string inflation models are already significantly constrained by the current data @xcite .",
    "a more difficult question is how cosmological observations might possibly provide evidence in favor of a string theory model of inflation .",
    "present observations and present theoretical considerations do not oblige us to expect an eventual positive result .",
    "however , if we are fortunate enough to detect evidence for string theory in the sky , this will most plausibly arise through a distinctive signature that is unnatural , albeit presumably possible , in field theory models .",
    "perhaps the best hope would be a striking correlation of many observables .",
