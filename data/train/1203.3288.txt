    "properties of products of random variables ( rvs ) are essential in performance analysis of contemporary wireless communication systems .",
    "for example , the fading amplitude of multi - hop relaying systems follows the distribution of the product of nakagami-@xmath0 rvs  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cascaded - keyhole channel can be modeled using the product of individual keyhole channels  @xcite .    the exact probability density function ( pdf ) and cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the product of independent beta , gamma and gaussian rvs can be represented in terms of the meijer - g function  @xcite .",
    "a more general framework involving the fox h - function was proposed in  @xcite for the distribution of product of almost any non - negative independent rvs . although being theoretically interesting , these g- or h - function representations are difficult to evaluate on a low - complexity computing platform , where the calculation of the product statistics is required  @xcite",
    ". the numerical calculations of g- and h - functions require a numerical solution of contour integrals or a construction of look - up tables that cover all parameter combinations . both approaches set stringent requirements for the considered platform either in the computing capability or the memory capacity .",

    "@xcite employed the mellin transform and the residue theorem to derive the pdf of a product of _ i.i.d .",
    "_ nakagami-@xmath0 rvs as an infinite series . by exploiting the structure of",
    "the mellin transforms , the authors in  @xcite proposed approximations to the pdfs and cdfs of products of independent rayleigh , gamma , nakagami-@xmath0 and gaussian rvs .",
    "however , when the rvs in product are correlated , exact distributions are known only in some special cases ( e.g. bivariate nakagami-@xmath0 in  @xcite ) . for arbitrary number of rvs with generic correlations ,",
    "none of the aforementioned methodologies are suitable to give a tractable solution .",
    "this is the main issue to be addressed in this paper .",
    "motivated by the central limit theorem ( clt ) , the approximation for the product of rvs can be constructed by using a lognormal density and its associated orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we apply the approach of  @xcite where the first few moments of the product and the approximated density function are set equal .",
    "the resulting approximative distribution involves only a finite sum of polynomials and the elementary lognormal density function .",
    "therefore , implementing the proposed expressions on practical computing platforms is straightforward compared with the g- or h - function representations .",
    "we note that the proposed framework is suitable for cases of both independent and correlated variables provided that moments of a product can be computed in closed - form .    in this paper",
    "we deduce a closed - form expression for the orthogonal polynomials associated with a general lognormal density .",
    "the result is obtained by taking advantage of the determinant representation of orthogonal polynomials . to give a specific example , we derive an approximative pdf and cdf for the product of both independent and correlated rvs .",
    "numerical results are compared with simulations in terms of the complementary cdf ( ccdf ) .",
    "the overall approximation accuracy is measured by the mean square error ( mse ) between the approximative cdf and the empirical cdf .",
    "the orthogonal polynomials associated with a standard lognormal density were first developed in  @xcite , which is a special case of our result .",
    "it is worth of noticing that our results are not straightforward extensions of the results presented in  @xcite but require new methodological elements .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is a gaussian rv with mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath4 follows the lognormal distribution @xmath5 and the @xmath6-th moment , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , of @xmath9 is given by @xmath10    let @xmath11 be the @xmath12-th degree polynomial @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the polynomials @xmath15 are said to be orthogonal with respect to the general lognormal density if @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a normalization factor .",
    "the symbol @xmath18 is the kronecker delta symbol , which is defined as @xmath19 if @xmath20 and zero otherwise .    due to  ( [ eq_moment ] ) any arbitrary moment of @xmath21 exists .",
    "thus , functions @xmath22 ( @xmath8 ) belong to the space of square integrable functions with respect to the weight function @xmath21",
    ". there exists a unique set of orthogonal polynomials @xmath15 which admits the explicit determinant representation @xmath23  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.1.1 ) , where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath12-th degree polynomial @xmath25 and the constant @xmath26 is formed by deleting the last row and column from @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the determinant ( [ eq_op_p1 ] ) can be expanded using the cofactors with respect to the last row .",
    "then @xmath11 becomes @xmath29 where the cofactor @xmath30 with respect to @xmath31 is obtained by removing the @xmath32-th column and the last row from ( [ eq_op_p1 ] ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . after comparing ( [ eq_op_cofactor ] ) with ( [ eq_p ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 let us calculate an explicit expression for @xmath36 .",
    "first , by the definition of @xmath30 and @xmath26 it is observed that @xmath37 , i.e. the orthogonal polynomials ( @xmath38 ) are monic .",
    "furthermore , after inserting ( [ eq_moment ] ) into @xmath30 and denoting @xmath39 , we obtain ( see appendix for details ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and ( [ eq_cofactor_expand ] ) becomes @xmath44 after substituting ( [ eq_cofactor_expand ] ) and ( [ eq_op_p2_expand ] ) into ( [ eq_cnk ] ) we find that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the generalized binomial coefficient .",
    "according to the clt , the distribution of a product of rvs can be approximated by a lognormal distribution when the number of rvs is large .",
    "motivated by this , we choose @xmath47 as an initial approximation for the distribution of a product of rvs in the context of the moment based density approximation , which is derived in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the @xmath49-th moment of a density function @xmath50 , the approximation to @xmath50 reads @xmath51 where the constant @xmath52 .",
    "note that the first @xmath53 moments of the approximation ( [ eq_approximant ] ) are matched with the corresponding moments of @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ( [ eq_approximant ] ) can be rearranged by combining the coefficients of @xmath54 with the same power of @xmath55 , resulting in @xmath56 where @xmath57 . after direct integration",
    "the approximated cdf attains the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the cdf of a standard normal rv .",
    "the ccdf @xmath60 is approximated by replacing @xmath61 with the expression  ( [ eq : cdf ] ) .",
    "it is a typical situation that the moments of certain rv are relatively easy to obtain whereas its exact distribution is difficult to calculate or unavailable  @xcite .",
    "the proposed approximations  ( [ eq_approximant ] ) and  ( [ eq : cdf ] ) are particularly useful in this situation , as will be shown in the next subsection .",
    "let rv @xmath62 be a product of @xmath63 nakagami-@xmath0 rvs each with the pdf @xmath64 we first consider the case when the variables @xmath65 are correlated with each other . in the literature , there exists different representations for the joint pdf of multivariate nakagami-@xmath0 rvs , which are either limited in parameter values or cross - correlation structures . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a recent result derived in  @xcite , which gives the joint pdf as a single integral . in the proposed approach ,",
    "the rvs @xmath65 are assumed to have the same fading parameter @xmath0 and the joint pdf is valid for integer and half - integer values of @xmath0 .",

    "we notice that with @xmath83 , the joint pdf  ( * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , when @xmath91 and @xmath96 , the proposed approximation yields improved accuracy compared with the results given in  @xcite .",
    "however , as @xmath90 , the approximations with the same correlation coefficients are noticeably inaccurate due to slow convergence of the series in  ( [ eq : cdf ] ) .",
    "note that in both cases the approximative ccdfs with @xmath105 deviate from the simulations since the clt fails under high correlation condition .",
    "table  [ tab_mse ] summarizes the mse @xmath106 between the approximation @xmath61 and the empirical distribution function @xmath107 of the product @xmath69 as a function of the number of rvs @xmath63 .",

    "when @xmath91 , all approximations are much more accurate compared with the corresponding rayleigh cases ( @xmath90 ) , and the mses @xmath110 , except for those where @xmath111 and @xmath112 , is less than @xmath113 in case of independent rvs or when correlation is low .",
    "although the accuracies of the approximations  ( [ eq_approximant ] ) and  ( [ eq : cdf ] ) should be improved as @xmath53 increases , analysis of the exact improvement is difficult due to the multiple nested finite summations involved .",

    "it is still an open problem to find a closed - form ( approximated ) distribution for the product of correlated nakagami-@xmath0 rvs under deep fading condition .",
