    "in recent years , owing mainly to the rapid advances both in new technologies of miniaturization and in highly sensitive squid magnetometry , there have been considerable theoretical and experimental studies carried out on the nanometer - scale magnets which exhibit macroscopic quantum phenomena(mqp).@xcite a number of nanometer - scale particles in the superparamagnetic regime have been identified as candidates for the observation of mqp such as the tunneling of the magnetization ( or the nel vector ) out of metastable potential minimum through the classically impenetrable barrier to a stable one , i.e. , macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) , or , more strikingly , macroscopic quantum coherence ( mqc ) , where the magnetization ( or the nel vector ) coherently oscillates between energetically degenerate easy directions over many periods . up to now , molecular magnets have been the most promising candidates to observe mqp because they have well - defined structures and magnetic properties .",
    "the system that have recently attracted much attention are the molecules @xmath2 $ ] ( in short mn@xmath3ac ) @xcite and @xmath4 ^{8+}$ ] ( in short fe@xmath5 ) , @xcite where tacn is a macrocyclic ligand triazacyclononance .",
    "the mn@xmath3ac molecule contains four mn@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ions in a central tretrahedron surrounded by eight mn@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) ions .",
    "oxygen bridges allow superexchange coupling among the mn ions , and both high - field and ac susceptometry experiments indicate a @xmath1 ground state , resulting from the four inner mn@xmath6 spins being paralleled to each other and the other eight mn@xmath8 also parallel with the two groups antiparallel to each other .",
    "the magnetization relaxation experiments , the dynamic susceptibility measurements , and the dynamic hysteresis experiments all indicate that the thermally assisted , magnetic - field - tuned resonant coherently quantum tunneling of magnetization occurs between spin states in a large number of identical mn@xmath3ac molecules .",
    "@xcite magnetic measurements have shown that fe@xmath5 also has a spin ground state @xmath1 , which arises from competing antiferromagnetic interactions between the eight @xmath10 iron spins with six spins being parallel and antiparallel to the other two spins .",
    "@xcite    one of the most striking effects in the magnetic mqp is that for some spin systems with high symmetries , the tunneling behaviors of magnetization seem sensitive to the parity of total spin of the magnet .",
    "it has been theoretically demonstrated @xcite that the ground - state tunneling level splitting is completely suppressed to zero for the half - integer total spin ferromagnets with biaxial crystal symmetry in the absence of an external magnetic field , resulting from the destructive interference of the berry phase or the wess - zumino , chern - simons term in the euclidean action between the symmetry - related tunneling paths connecting two classically degenerate minima . such destructive interference effect for half - integer spins is known as the topological quenching . @xcite",
    "but for the integer spins , the quantum interference between topologically different tunneling paths is constructive , and therefore the ground - state tunneling level splitting is nonzero . while such spin - parity effects are sometimes related to kramers degeneracy , they typically go beyond this theorem in rather unexpected ways .",
    "@xcite one recent experimental method based on the landau - zener model was developed by wernsdorfer and sessoli @xcite to measure the very small tunnel splitting on the order of @xmath11k in molecular fe@xmath5 magnets .",
    "they observed a clear oscillation of the tunnel splitting as a function of the magnetic field applied along the hard anisotropy axis , which is direct evidence of the role of the topological spin phase ( berry phase ) in the spin dynamics of these molecules .",
    "motivated by the experiment on topological phase interference or spin - parity effects in the molecule fe@xmath5 , @xcite in this paper we investigate the resonant quantum tunneling of the magnetization vector in molecular magnets with biaxial crystal symmetry in the presence of an external magnetic field at an arbitrarily directed angle in the zy plane . by applying the instanton technique in the spin - coherent - state path - integral representation ,",
    "@xcite we calculate both the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) exponent and the preexponential factor in the ground - state tunnel splitting .",
    "our results show that for the small angle @xmath12 of the applied magnetic field , the ground - state tunnel splitting oscillates with the field for both the integer and half - integer spins , and the oscillation behavior for integer spins is significantly different from that for half - integer spins . however , this oscillation is completely suppressed for the large angle region",
    ". the distinct angular dependence , together with the dependence of the ground - state tunnel splitting on the strength of the external applied magnetic field , may provide an independent experimental test for spin - parity effects in molecular magnets .",
    "it is noted that the instanton technique is semiclassical in nature , i.e. , valid for large spins and in the continuum limit . whether the instanton technique can be applied in studying the spin dynamics in the molecular magnet with @xmath1 ( such as fe@xmath5 )",
    "is an open question .",
    "we study this problem with the help of exact diagonalization calculation .",
    "our results show that the analytical calculation based on the instanton technique agrees excellently well with the exact diagonalization calculation , which strongly suggests that the molecular magnet with @xmath1 can be treated as a giant spin system .",
    "the system of interest is a molecular magnet at a temperature well below its anisotropy gap , which has the following euclidean action in the spin - coherent - state representation , @xcite    @xmath13 , \\label{action}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the total spin of the molecular magnet .",
    "the polar angle @xmath15 and the azimuthal angle @xmath16 label the spin coherent state .",
    "@xmath17 is the total energy of the molecular magnet which includes the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and the zeeman energy when an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "it is noted that the euclidean action is written in the north - pole gauge , and the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) define the wess - zumino or berry term which arises from the nonorthogonality of spin coherent states .",
    "the wess - zumino term has a simple geometrical or topological interpretation . for a closed path ,",
    "this term equals @xmath18 times the area swept out on the unit sphere between the path and the north pole . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) is a total imaginary - time derivative , which has no effect on the classical equation of motion for the magnetization vector , but yields the boundary contribution to the euclidean action .",
    "loss et al .",
    "@xcite and von delft and henley @xcite studied the physical effect of this total derivative term , and they found that this term is crucial for the quantum properties of the magnetic particle and makes the tunneling behaviors of integer and half - integer spins strikingly different .    in the semiclassical limit , the dominant contribution to the euclidean transition amplitude comes from finite action solutions of the classical equations of motion ( instantons ) , which can be expressed as the following equations in the spherical coordinate system , @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the classical path .",
    "note that the euclidean action eq .",

    "splitting @xmath26 for mqc ( not including the geometric phase factor generated by the topological term in the euclidean action ) is given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the small - angle precession or oscillation frequency in the well , and @xmath29 is the classical action or the wkb exponent which minimizes the euclidean action of eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) .",
    "the preexponential factor @xmath30 originates from the quantum fluctuations about the classical path , which can be evaluated by expanding the euclidean action to second order in the small fluctuations .",
    "we describe the molecular magnet with biaxial crystal symmetry by the standard hamiltonian , @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 are proportional to the anisotropy coefficients , and we take the easy , medium , and hard axes as * x * , * y * , and * z * , respectively .",
    "if the magnetic field is applied in zy plane , at an arbitrary angle @xmath33 with * z * , the hamiltonian becomes @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the land factor , and @xmath36 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the zeeman energy term associated with the applied field @xmath37 @xmath38 is given in the last two terms of the hamiltonian . if the field is below some critical value @xmath39 ( to be computed ) , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hami_mag ] ) has two degenerate minima , and therefore the magnetization can resonate between these two directions , providing a case of mqc . under the spin - coherent - state and the imaginary time representation , the @xmath40 term in the euclidean action is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the transverse and longitudinal anisotropy coefficients respectively , and @xmath44 being the anisotropy field . introducing @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , the @xmath40 reduces to @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant that makes @xmath40 zero at the initial state .",
    "it is clearly shown in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) that the energy minima of system are at @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and therefore there are two different instanton paths of opposite windings around hard anisotropy axis .",
    "we denote them by instanton @xmath54 , and instanton @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "the critical field at which the energy barrier disappears can be determined by ,    @xmath57    taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ crit_a ] ) and ( [ crit_b ] ) , we obtain @xmath58 for the special cases @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 , respectively . the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath12 is plotted in fig . 1 for @xmath62 .",
    "now we investigate the tunneling behaviors of magnetization by applying the instanton technique in the spin - coherent - state path - integral representation .",
    "first of all , we must find out the classical path @xmath63 and @xmath64 that satisfies the boundary condition . along the classical path , @xmath65 is conserved , so that the relation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be found purely by using energy conservation .",
    "@xcite after some algebra , we obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 are variables defined by @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 . here",
    "we assume that the condition @xmath74 @xmath75 is always fulfilled for the small magnetic field @xmath76 .",

    ", one can take @xmath67 to be entirely real ( see appendix a for detail ) .",
    "@xcite then through the expression @xmath79 , the desired wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) exponents ( or classical actions ) are found to be @xmath80 for instanton @xmath77 , and @xmath81 for instanton @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the difference of the action of two tunneling paths is @xmath82 note that @xmath83 comes from the berry phase @xmath84 , and leads to the oscillation of the ground - state tunnel splitting with the magnetic field .",
    "the preexponential factor in the tunnel splitting can be evaluated by taking the asymptotic form of zero - mode @xmath85 @xcite which can be deduced from the classical equations of motion ( see appendix a ) .    finally , the ground - state tunnel splitting is found to be @xmath86 with @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "the dimensionless prefactor @xmath89 can often be of order 1 or so , and is therefore relevant to the exact diagonalization calculation .",
    "before we discuss the eq .",
    "( [ split0 ] ) , we note here that our model can be directly related to the model describing the molecular fe@xmath5 magnet , @xcite @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 . according to the typical parameters of fe@xmath5 , @xmath95k , @xmath96k and @xmath97 , we obtain that @xmath98k , @xmath99k , @xmath100 and @xmath101 t .",
    "these parameters are used throughout the whole calculation .",
    "first , we discuss the effects of arbitrarily directed field on the spin phase oscillation .",
    "our results show that the topological phase interference or spin - parity effects depend on the direction of the magnetic field significantly . from eq ( [ split0 ] ) , whether the ground - state tunnel splitting oscillates with the field is determined by two factors , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for a fixed field strength ,",
    "i.e. @xmath104 , it brings two - fold effects to increase the field angle @xmath12 : ( _ i _ ) the dependence of @xmath102 on the field strength is reduced .",
    "as @xmath12 increases up to @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 gradually reduces to a constant @xmath108 ( _ ii _ ) the degree of oscillation @xmath109 which is defined as a ratio of the oscillation part @xmath110 to the non - oscillation part @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ split0 ] ) decreases from @xmath112 to a small value .    for @xmath113 (",
    "the field is along the hard anisotropy axis ) , the symmetry of two classical paths imposes @xmath114 then , the tunnel splitting @xmath115 oscillates with the field and thus vanish whenever @xmath116 where @xmath117 is an integer .",
    "@xcite for @xmath118 ( the field is along the medium anisotropy axis ) , on the other hand , @xmath119 becomes a constant @xmath120 , and therefore the tunnel splitting increases monotonically with the field .",
    "when the field is applied in zy plane with an arbitrarily angle @xmath12 , one may expect to observe a crossover for a certain field angle @xmath121 .",
    "choosing the magnitude of @xmath122 to be the first value that makes cos@xmath123 and taking @xmath124 , we obtain @xmath125 for the molecular fe@xmath5 magnet , @xmath62 , we find @xmath126 , which agrees well with the exact diagonalization calculation ( shown in fig . 2a ) and the experimental results obtained by wernsdorfer and sessoli . @xcite it is noted that the value of @xmath127 is independent of the total spin @xmath14 of the molecular magnet , and depends on the parameter @xmath128 only . for highly anisotropic materials ,",
    "the typical values of the transverse and longitudinal anisotropy coefficients are @xmath129erg/@xmath130 and @xmath131erg/@xmath130 .",
    "thus , @xmath132 , the value of @xmath121 is estimated to be @xmath133 and is much smaller than that for the molecular fe@xmath5 magnet , which means that even a very small misalignment of the field with the hard anisotropy axis can completely destroy the oscillation .",
    "therefore , the molecular fe@xmath5 magnet is a better candidate for observing the oscillation of the ground - state tunnel splitting with the field compared with the highly anisotropic materials .",
    "next , we turn to the comparison between the analytical calculations and the numerical stimulations .",
    "it is noted that the instanton approach is semiclassical in nature , i.e. , valid for large spins and in the continuum limit . whether the instanton technique can be applied in studying the spin dynamics in molecular magnets with @xmath1 ( such as fe@xmath5 )",

    "2a , for fe@xmath5 , the analytical results based on the instanton technique are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization results .",
    "in order to show the agreement more clearly , we have presented the numerical and analytical results in table 1 for the molecular fe@xmath5 magnet in the magnetic field applied at angle @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "it is clearly shown that the accuracy of the semiclassical calculation is very high for the low magnetic field up to @xmath137 t for the entire region of the angle @xmath138 . as a result , we conclude that the molecular magnet with @xmath1 can be treated as a giant spin system .",

    "( 3a ) and ( 3b ) .",
