    "the behavior of quantum fluids ( e.g. helium or hydrogen ) in reduced dimensionality is one of the most interesting topics in low temperature physics.@xcite among the systems of particular interest are monolayer films ( which are effectively two - dimensional , or 2d ) and fluids within narrow pores ( 1d ) or droplets ( 0d).@xcite properties associated with phase transitions ( e.g. critical exponents ) are particularly sensitive to the dimensionality , as exemplified by the kosterlitz - thouless theory of the 2d superfluid transition in he films.@xcite confined ideal gases are particularly amenable to theoretical study , because one need solve just the single particle schrdinger equation in the given environment , rather than the fully interacting many - body problem.@xcite such an idealized model can provide qualitatively , and sometimes quantitatively , reliable predictions of the effects of confinement on the fluid .",
    "furthermore , these calculations can be supplemented , in some cases , by virial expansions in order to assess the role of interactions , presuming their effects to be weak.@xcite in contrast , dense quantum fluids require the use of the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) or diffusion monte carlo methods , which are computationally demanding approaches .",
    "nevertheless , these techniques has been applied in recent years to many problems of reduced dimensionality.@xcite    considerable progress in understanding @xmath5 behavior has also been achieved on the experimental front . although the evolution of superfluidity in thin films was first observed in heat capacity experiments nearly 70 years ago , that subject remains incompletely understood.@xcite the problem of quantum droplets has received particular attention in recent years , stimulated especially by the search for superfluid hydrogen.@xcite the discovery of carbon nanotubes and interest in other quasi-1d porous media have led to many investigations of 1d quantum fluids.@xcite    this paper addresses a set of problems involving helium and hydrogen within small radius ( @xmath2 ) cylindrical pores , such as carbon nanotubes . for @xmath6 , one encounters the strictly 1d limit of a quantum fluid . while there has been considerable exploration of the zero temperature ( @xmath3 ) behavior of such systems , relatively few studies of finite @xmath3 behavior of the interacting system have been carried out.@xcite in a recent study , we explored such behavior for 1d @xmath0he .",
    "it was demonstrated that a 1d phonon model , analogous to the landau hydrodynamic theory of liquid @xmath0he , does describe the behavior at low @xmath3 of 1d @xmath0he at moderate to high density ( compared to the equilibrium density @xmath7/).@xcite section [ sec:4he-0 t ] of the present paper presents a finite range density functional study of the behavior of @xmath0he , at temperature @xmath4 , as @xmath2 is varied .",
    "the results exhibit the evolution of the system from an essentially 1d `` axial phase '' to a `` cylindrical shell '' phase , localized near the pore walls.@xcite section [ sec : h2-finitet ] shows how the behavior of h@xmath1 at finite @xmath3 , but low density , varies with pore radius @xmath2 .",

    "for the two smallest radii , the overall outcome , as seen in the upper panel of fig .",

    "the situation is reversed for the largest radii . for @xmath56   ,",
    "the potential energy gain of about 2  k near the cylinder axis is sufficient to sustain a non - negligible amount of fluid in that region .",
    "as a consequence , pores of radii between somewhat less than 7   and more than 9   result in a particle density spread out from axis to wall , and the appearance of the purely axial regime shifts towards larger radii .",
    "for radii near 12   and above , instead , the correlation effects in the helium fluid are negligible and the system behaves essentially as a confined gas .",
    "we consider in this section the adsorption of h@xmath1 ( which , after @xmath0he , is the textbook quantum fluid ) molecules inside a cylindrical pore within a bulk solid . as in the preceding section , a low density gas of molecules within a large pore will typically adsorb first onto the inner surface of the pore , creating a 2d cylindrical shell phase at low densities ; at higher densities , central regions of the pore will fill with a 3d bulk adsorbate.@xcite very narrow pores , however , will constrain the adsorbate to lie near the pore axis , forming a quasi-1d ( `` axial '' ) phase .",

    "the axial and shell phases can be distinguished in the classical , noninteracting case by the location of the potential minimum ( @xmath44 or @xmath63 ) for a given pore radius @xmath2 .",
    "quantum mechanically , one must resort to either solving the schrdinger equation and finding the peak probability from the radial wavefunction ( for the noninteracting case ) or by carrying out a full path integral monte carlo simulation ( in the general interacting case ) .",
    "besides their use in monte carlo simulations , the path integral method also yields a semiclassical approximation to the density that is almost as simple as inspection of the classical potential .",

    "this energy is greater than that of the classical potential minimum , due to the zero point energy .",
    "it is also located closer to the axis , because the repulsive hard wall of the potential at @xmath93 damps the wavefunctions of quantum particles in the repulsive region .",
    "qualitatively , then , these semiclassical considerations imply that a quantum gas has a greater tendency to be confined near the axis than does a classical gas , agreeing with the preceding results obtained by pimc simulation .",
    "quantitatively , the semiclassical approximation breaks down at temperatures above the @xmath59  k studied by pimc , but one may use it for qualitative purposes .",
    "for example , the location of the effective potential minimum at higher temperatures ( @xmath94  k ) is given in figure  [ fig : rmin - effpot ] .",
