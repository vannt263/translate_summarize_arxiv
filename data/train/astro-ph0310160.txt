    "the sauron project with william herschel telescope ( @xcite ) is providing the wide - field mapping of the kinematics and stellar population , which will certainly give stringent constraints on the galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "multiobject and integral field spectrographs are being developed also on 8 - 10 m ground - based telescopes , which can give the time evolution of such internal structure . to derive the physical processes from such observational data ,",
    "it is necessary to construct a realistic model , i.e. , a three - dimensional chemodynamical model , and to compare the theoretical predictions with such observational data .",
    "theoretical approaches have been performed in many ways : 1 ) the one - zone model ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) played an important role in constructing the basic evolutionary scenarios of galaxies . in this model ,",
    "the star formation history of a galaxy is constructed by carefully comparing the model predictions with the mean photometric and chemical properties of observed galaxies . however , because of the simplified assumption that all matter in a galaxy is well - mixed instantaneously , the one - zone model provides no idea of the internal structure of galaxies .",
    "2 ) the semi - analytic model ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is based on the press - schechter theory , can provide the mass function of dark halos , their survival timescales , and the merging rates . by adopting empirical laws to determine the stellar mass and the mass of heavy elements , and by introducing simple rules to determine the galaxy morphology ( i.e. , an elliptical galaxy forms from the major merger of spiral galaxies )",
    ", the semi - analytic model could reproduce some correlations among global properties ( e.g. , the tully - fisher relation and color - magnitude relation ) and some constraints on the number of galaxies ( e.g. , the luminosity function and number counts ) .",
    "however , there seems to be some difficulties to explain the number evolution of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed information on the internal structures remains untouched .",
    "3 ) numerical simulations of dissipationless systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) provide the interpretation of the interaction of galaxies and the internal structure of a galaxy .",
    "the gas dynamics in three dimensions was included in such numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and then star formation , feedback ( @xcite ) , and chemical enrichment ( @xcite ) were included .",
    "it is now possible to predict the spatial distributions of gas , stars , and heavy elements in a galaxy .",
    "however , the comparison with the observations has not been fully attempted yet .",
    "the reason is that it takes long time to calculate the evolution of one galaxy with enough resolution to predict such distributions . to reduce the calculation time and to improve the resolution ,",
    "a variety of methods have been invented .",
    "the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method ( sph ) is widely used to calculate three dimensional hydrodynamics with a lagrangian scheme ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for a review ) , and has been applied to many astrophysical problems that have large density contrasts ; formation of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and a cloud - cloud collision ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "various codes have been developed to combine sph with collisionless particles ( i.e. , dark matter and star particles ; hereafter an n - body system ) using different methods to calculate gravitational forces ; direct summations , particle - particle / particle - mesh methods ( @xcite ) , tree methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the method using the special purpose computer grape ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "grape ( gravity pipe ) is a special purpose computer for efficiently calculating gravitational force and potential ( @xcite ) .",
    "the grape - sph enables us to simulate the formation and evolution of a galaxy with more than @xmath3 particles in calculation time as short as a few days .",
    "it makes it possible to simulate many types of galaxies with different initial conditions , which is crucial to study the formation and evolution of galaxies statistically .",
    "the aim of our study is to put constraints on the formation history of elliptical galaxies by comparing the observed internal structures of stellar population .",
    "to construct a self - consistent three - dimensional chemodynamical model , we have introduced various physical processes associated with the formation of stellar systems such as radiative cooling , star formation , feedback of type ii and ia supernovae ( sne ii and sne ia ) , and stellar winds ( sws ) , and chemical enrichment .",
    "the chemical enrichment of sne ia has been recently included in several chemodynamical models . among two alternative scenarios of the sn",
    "ia progenitor ( e.g. , @xcite ) , most chemodynamical models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) adopted @xcite s formulation based on the double - degenerate scenario .",
    "@xcite adopted single time delay for the sn ia contribution , and the parameter corresponds to the double - degenerate scenario .",
    "the single - degenerate scenario has been introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it may be useful to note that @xcite s iron yield is too large compared with the observed abundance ratios in the milky way galaxy , and thus their iron yield should be reduced to be half .",
    "such modification is always adopted in the one - zone models , but is never mentioned in many chemodynamical models . we have constructed a realistic model of chemical enrichment , excluding the instantaneous recycling approximation , including the mass - dependent yields of sne ii and the single - degenerate scenario of sne ia .",
    "we then solved the evolution of slowly - rotating systems that consist of dark matter , gas , and stars from various initial conditions to predict the spatial distribution of stellar population within a galaxy . by comparing the theoretical metallicity gradients with the observed ones , we discuss the origin of elliptical galaxies .",
    "how elliptical galaxies form is a long - standing issue as a matter of big debate .",
    "the regularity in the light distribution and the global velocity anisotropy in elliptical galaxies were explained by the violent relaxation ( @xcite ) .",
    "effectively dissipationless formation of an elliptical galaxy was discussed in various ways ; e.g. , stars have formed prior to the beginning of the collapse of the gas cloud ( @xcite , 1975 ) or stars have formed slowly in disk galaxies which subsequently merge to make a spheroidal galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the limit of completely dissipationless collapse is amenable to n - body experiments , which can form the objects that have the observed dynamical properties .",
    "however , the dissipation during the formation is indispensable to explain the photometric and chemical properties of elliptical galaxies such as the color - magnitude relation , the mass - metallicity relation , and the radial metallicity gradients .",
    "two competing scenarios of the formation of elliptical galaxies have so far been proposed : elliptical galaxies should form monolithically by gravitational collapse of gas cloud with considerable energy dissipation ( hereafter referred to as the monolithic collapse hypothesis ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , or alternatively ellipticals should form via mergers of gaseous disk galaxies or of many dwarf galaxies ( hereafter referred to as the merger hypothesis ; e.g. , @xcite ; kauffmann et al . 1993 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the merger hypothesis can be supported by the dynamical disturbances of observed ellipticals such as shells / ripples and multiple cores ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and may easily explain the morphology - density relation of galaxies in clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , elliptical galaxies show apparently little evidence for on - going star formation , the bulk of their stars are old ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the monolithic collapse hypothesis assumes that the bulk of stars in ellipticals form during an initial star burst at high redshift , and that the star formation is terminated by a supernovae - driven galactic wind that expels the left - over interstellar gas from galaxies . the galactic wind is supposed to play an essential role in injecting heavy elements into the hot intracluster gas ( @xcite ) , and predicts tight correlations among global properties of galaxies such as the color - magnitude relation ( @xcite ) , the metallicity - velocity dispersion relation ( @xcite ) , and the fundamental plane ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( the color - magnitude relation could be reproduced also under the merger hypothesis ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) . )",
    "recent observations of clusters at high redshifts reveal that these relationships exist even at @xmath4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; stanford et al .",
    "1998 ) , which indicates that the bulk of stars in cluster ellipticals forms at the redshift @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , for cluster early - type galaxies , it has been argued that the `` progenitor bias '' is significant ; the progenitors of the youngest low - redshift early - type galaxies drop out of the sample at high redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2001 ) .",
    "thus the evolution of field early - type galaxies is now paid attention as the observational constraints .",
    "@xcite found that hdf - n early - type galaxies are relatively young with the formation epochs spanning @xmath6 , but no evolution of field elliptical galaxies found at least @xmath7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found mass evolution at @xmath8 . at high redshift ,",
    "the number of field red ellipticals is smaller than expected by the monolithic collapse hypothesis ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and there may be some global evolution that is consistent with the hierarchical clustering scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "the radial metallicity gradient gives one of the most stringent constraints on the galaxy formation .",
    "numerical simulations of the collapse of galaxies including star formation definitely predict strong radial gradients in chemical enrichment ( e.g. , @xcite , 1975 ; @xcite ) , whereas the dissipationless collapse models predict no gradient in chemical enrichment ( @xcite , 1975 ) . during the collapse , gas is chemically enriched , flows inward , and forms new stars , which form the radial metallicity gradients .",
    "the metallicity gradients are observed as radial gradients of colors and spectral line indices ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a typical observed metallicity gradient of elliptical galaxies is @xmath9 , which is less steep than those predicted by numerical simulations of dissipative collapse ( @xmath10 in @xcite ; @xmath11 in @xcite ; @xmath12 in @xcite ) . furthermore , if elliptical galaxies form monolithically from a massive gas cloud , metallicity gradient should correlate with global properties of galaxies in the sense that more massive galaxies have steeper gradients ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observational feature of metallicity gradients is complicated and confusing because of a lack of suitable sample of uniform quality .",
    "it was shown that elliptical galaxies with larger values of the central mg@xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) index tend to have steeper mg@xmath2 gradients ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , davies et al .",
    "( 1993 ) did not find any significant correlation between the mg@xmath2 gradient and @xmath14 in the sample of 13 galaxies .",
    "kobayashi & arimoto ( 1999 ) re - studied line - strength gradients of 80 elliptical galaxies by using the indices of mg@xmath2 , mg@xmath15 ( 5177@xmath16 ) , fe@xmath17 ( 5270@xmath16 ) , fe@xmath2 ( 5335@xmath16 ) and h@xmath18 ( 4861@xmath16 ) , and found that the metallicity gradients do not correlate with any physical properties of galaxies , including central and mean metallicities , central velocity dispersions , absolute b - magnitudes , absolute effective radii , and dynamical masses of galaxies .",
    "elliptical galaxies have different metallicity gradients , even if they have nearly identical properties such as masses , luminosities , and metallicities",
    ".    this discrepancy could be solved if mergers flatten the original gradient .",
    "indeed numerical simulations showed that the gradient in a disk galaxy should be halved after three successive mergers of galaxies with similar size ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , according to the dissipationless n - body experiment , the initial state is not fully wiped out during the violent relaxation phase , and n - body particles that were in the outer region of a progenitor galaxy are found in the similar location after merging events ( @xcite ) . from this point , it has been mentioned that metallicity gradients is not reduced by a merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "simulations of both dissipative collapse and mergers leave room for improvements , because essential physical processes such as star formation , feedback of supernovae , and metal enrichment were not taken into account .    here",
    "we simulate the chemodynamical evolution of elliptical galaxies based on the cdm picture . in the cdm cosmology ,",
    "the amplitude of primordial fluctuation decreases with increasing wavelength , and the formation of structure is driven by the hierarchical clustering .",
    "galaxies should form through the successive mergings of sub - galaxies with various masses .",
    "contrary to the semi - analytic models , we exclude the assumption that elliptical galaxies form only from the major merger of disk galaxies . instead we allow various merging histories for elliptical galaxies . in some cases , an elliptical galaxy forms by an assembly of gas rich small galaxies , which looks like a monolithic collapse . in other cases , the evolved galaxies with little gas merge to form an elliptical galaxy .",
    "this scenario is the midway of monolithic collapse and major merger of disk galaxies .    in this paper",

    "here we describe the grape - sph code , which is originally written by n. nakasato ( 2000 ) , and is highly adaptive in space and time by means of individual smoothing lengths and individual timesteps .",

    "here we describe the formulation and the assumptions of each physical processes .",
    "radiative cooling is modeled using an equilibrium cooling function . if gas is primordial with no heavy elements ( [ fe / h ] @xmath53 ) , we compute the cooling rates using two - body processes of h and he , and free - free emission ( katz et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these processes are collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen ( h@xmath54 ) and singly ionized helium ( he@xmath55 ) , collisional ionization of h@xmath54 , he@xmath54 , and he@xmath55 , standard recombination of h@xmath55 , he@xmath55 , and he@xmath56 , dielectric recombination of he@xmath55 , and free - free emission .",

    "heavy elements can significantly enhance the cooling rate . at @xmath59",
    "k , fe group line emission processes largely determine the cooling function , whereas at lower temperatures the lighter atoms such as c , o , and ne dominate . although the metallicity effect is small at @xmath60 k , the cooling rate with [ fe / h ] @xmath61 is @xmath62 times larger than that for the primordial gas around @xmath63 k. the radiative cooling , and hence the star formation rate , strongly depends on the metallicity . in the table of cooling function that we use ,",
    "cooling rates are given as functions of [ fe / h ] , and the elemental abundance ratios are set to be constant for given [ fe / h ] according to the relations in the solar neighborhood ; galactic halo stars ( i.e. , [ o / fe]@xmath64 ) for [ fe / h ] @xmath65 , and the solar values for [ fe / h ] @xmath66 , and interpolated the halo and solar values for @xmath67 [ fe / h ] @xmath68 .",
    "since the elemental abundance ratios depend on the star formation history and the inhomogeneous mixing of sne ii and ia , the cooling tables depending on [ o / fe ] are required to increase the accuracy .",
    "the treatment of star formation is similar to that in @xcite , which is widely used in grape - sph simulations . if a gas particle satisfies the following star formation criteria , a fractional part of the mass of the gas particle turns to a star particle .",
    "since an individual star particle has the mass of @xmath69 , it dose not represent a single star , but an association of many stars .",

    "the numerical accuracy for high density regions is much better than in mesh based methods , but the accuracy for low density regions is poorer . in an sph simulation such as those of @xcite , the numerical resolution ( 100 - 1000 pc ) is larger than the typical size of supernova remnants ( several tens of pc ) .",
    "thus , because of the nature of the sph method and the lack of resolution in current computing resources , it is necessary to simplify the release of the energy , momentum , and mass from stars .",

    "* minor merger* the formation of the main component of the present - day galaxy is the same as above two classes , but these galaxies undergo minor merger events at @xmath225 .",

    "the mass of the primary galaxy is no more than five times larger than the mass of the secondary galaxy .",
    "the redshift @xmath218 generally corresponds to the galaxy formation epoch , and the main component of the present - day galaxy forms at @xmath231 .",

    "* continuous star formation* galaxies grow though continuous star formation .",
    "after the initial star burst , there are the accretion of gas clumps and/or the interaction with other galaxies , which make the star formation continue to lower redshifts .",

    "we define a galaxy as the projection of @xmath252 kpc on the @xmath198-@xmath199 plane .",
    "below radius @xmath21 means a projected radius .",
    "we then derive the effective radius @xmath253 by fitting a de vaucouleurs law to the surface brightness profile . for the simulated galaxies ,",
    "we exclude the central region with @xmath254 kpc and @xmath255 kpc when fitting simulations with high- and low- resolution , respectively , because the surface brightness is smeared out due to the softening of the gravity . in the outer region , to derive proper effective radii in the simulation , we use large enough regions such as @xmath256 kpc . in some case",

    "@xmath295 is larger than @xmath294 , and spans from @xmath298 to @xmath192 .",
    "these are because star formation strongly depends on gas density and takes place slowly in the less - massive secondary galaxies . at @xmath299 , some major mergers ( @xmath230 ) have @xmath300 , which means that the secondary galaxies have comparable mass and gas content to the primaries .",
    "these induce strong star formation ( surrounded by circles ) . relatively weaker star formation ( surrounded by triangles ) is induced by mergers with @xmath301 , which means that the stellar mass of the secondary is small and the secondary galaxy behave like a gas cloud .",

    "the gradient change strongly depends on the mass ratio @xmath232 .",
    "the mergers with @xmath304 decrease the gradients at least by @xmath221 dex .",
    "this is the reason why we have defined major mergers as those with @xmath304 . a major merger changes the orbits of stars .",
    "the stars that are in the center and have high metallicities are able to move to the outer region of the galaxy . however , if the secondary galaxy contains as much gas as the primary galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath300 ) and strong star formation is induced ( surrounded by circles ) , then the gradient change stays smaller than @xmath221 dex .",
    "this is because such star formation takes place after the gas falls into the center of the primary galaxy and increases the metallicity at the center , resulting in a small gradient change . sometimes merging of a gas rich galaxy ( @xmath301 )",
    "also induces moderate star formation ( surrounded by triangles ) . in this case , star formation takes place in the outer region of the galaxy , and the gradient change can be as large as @xmath297 dex , even if @xmath305 . in some cases without a merging event ,",
    "a similar star formation is induced by late gas accretion , and the metallicity gradient gradually becomes shallower .    by showing the similar figure in @xcite , we argue that dynamical information on the orbits of n - body particles is not fully wiped out by a merger , but fairly lost to change the metallicity gradient .",
    "figures [ fig : enend ] and [ fig : enenm ] show the energies @xmath306 of particles before and after a merging event .",
    "large @xmath307 means that a particle has an extended orbit .",

    "figure [ fig : enend ] shows the same but for the non - merger galaxy i d h3/782389913 .",
    "clearly , the dispersion for the merger galaxy is much larger than the non - merger galaxy .    in summary , whether the merging event changes the metallicity gradient is mainly influenced by two factors ; 1 ) the mass ratio of the merging galaxies @xmath232 and 2 ) the induced star formation .",

    "iii ) passive evolution as star formation is induced in the outer regions at a rate dependent on @xmath295 .",

    "the global properties of elliptical galaxies depend mainly on their masses , while their metallicity gradients are much affected by their merging history . merging histories",
    "can thus , in principle , be inferred from the observed metallicity gradients of present - day galaxies .",
    "the dispersion in metallicity gradients for galaxies with similar merging histories is not small ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gh ] ) , and so it may be difficult to determine the merging history of an individual galaxy from its metallicity gradient . however , it should be possible to estimate the fractions of non - merger and merger galaxies by using the statistics of metallicity gradients .",
    "for example , if the fractions are estimated for field and cluster galaxies , it should provide information about environmental effects on galaxy formation . even allowing for the uncertainties in available observations of nearby galaxies ,",
    "our predicted difference between gradients of non - merger and merger galaxies is large enough to be detected .",
    "we should note that there are two problems in the simulated galaxies , which can not be improved by changing parameters in the present model .",
    "one is that galactic winds do not occur in large galaxies in the simulations , and star formation never terminates completely .",
    "the colors of our galaxies thus tend to be bluer than the observation , and the b - v color distribution extends to 0.4 mag bluer . in our galaxy centers ,",
    "the color gradients tend to have the opposite slope to the metallicity gradients , because the stellar populations there are young .",
    "such late star formation takes place in the central @xmath192 kpc , and this region is carefully excluded when estimating metallicity gradients in this paper .",
    "this problem arises from our sph method and our feedback scheme .",
    "if we include the kinetic feedback with @xmath102 , surface brightness decreases at the center , and metal - rich gas blow out .",
    "however , these results in too large effective radii and too shallow metallicity gradients to meet the observation .",
    "figure [ fig : param ] shows the surface brightness profiles and metallicity gradients with ( dash - dotted line ) and without ( solid line ) @xmath101 using the same initial condition . with @xmath103 ,",
    "the surface brightness decreases by @xmath310 mag at the center , which results in @xmath311 kpc ( @xmath312 kpc for @xmath246 ) .",
    "the metallicity gradient is almost flat within @xmath253 . to describe galactic winds with the kinetic feedback",
    ", star formation scheme should be modified simultaneously .",
    "we note that our predictions for oxygen abundance are not changed so much , whereas the iron abundance should decrease especially at the galaxy center . in figure",
    "[ fig : grad ] , there appear to be a relation between the iron abundance and iron gradients .",
    "this is because late star formation at the galaxy center increases the iron abundance and steepens iron gradients at the same time .",
    "such a relation can disappear if the galaxy model is improved . in figure",
    "[ fig : gh ] , the mean value of simulated iron gradients is steeper than observed .",
    "this is also caused by the same reason . if the galaxy model is improved so as to blow a galactic wind , iron gradients for non - merger galaxies will become the similar to their oxygen gradients .",
    "however , iron gradients for merger galaxies will be still steeper than oxygen gradients .",
    "the difference of iron and oxygen gradients , i.e. , [ o / fe ] gradients , may be the best indicator of the formation history of the galaxy . to discuss [ o / fe ] ,",
    "observational data of high - enough s / n is required , and the spectral population synthesis models should be prepared for various [ o / fe ] .",
    "the other problem is that simulated galaxies are more extended , and thus there is an offset in the radius - magnitude relation .",
    "this problem is not in magnitude , because the faber - jackson relation can be reproduced , and the galaxy with given mass has reasonable luminosity .",
    "while the stellar mass - to - light ratio is consistent with the observation as @xmath313 , the total mass - to - light ratio is as large as @xmath314 ( within a sphere of @xmath248 ) , which may be too large .",
    "the baryon fraction increases to @xmath297 at the center ( @xmath315 kpc ) because of the stellar concentration , but is as small as @xmath229 in @xmath316 .",
    "baryon does not fully dominate even at the galaxy center in our simulated galaxies , and the stellar concentration seems to be not enough compared with the dark matter concentration",
    ". these might be due to cosmological parameters , dynamical friction , star formation parameter , and the limited field size of initial condition .",
    "as well known with the zero - point offset in the tully - fisher relation ( @xcite ) , such high dark matter concentration should arise from the standard cdm cosmology that is adopted in this paper , and should decrease to some extent with the @xmath187-cdm cosmology .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the zero - point offset remains even with the @xmath187-cdm cosmology , which requires substantial revision to the cdm scenario such as @xmath317 , a tilt in the primordial power spectrum , or hot dark matter .",
    "the dynamical friction may be effective because the mass of a dark matter particle is ten times larger than the gas and stellar particles ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "too large effective radius suggests that the star formation takes place too early before the gas accretes towards the center .",
    "this can be solved by changing the star formation timescale , i.e. , reducing the star formation parameter @xmath81 , although colors become bluer .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : param ] , with @xmath82 ( dotted line ) , the surface brightness increase by 1 mag at the center , which results in smaller effective radius as @xmath318 kpc .",
    "the metallicity increases because of longer timescale of star formation , but the gradient dose not change so much . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : fit ] , the surface brightness profiles of our simulated galaxies well follow the de - vaucouleurs law , but is smeared out at the center , and the central surface brightness ( @xmath315 kpc ) is slightly smaller than the de - vaucouleurs fit ( see fig.[fig : param ] ) . although the resolution is not enough to discuss , this central stellar concentration may be smaller than other simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , can be as large with @xmath82 , and should be affected by the difference in the star formation and feedback schemes .",
    "surface brightness profiles ( upper panel ) and metallicity gradients ( lower panel ) with kinetic feedback ( dash - dotted line , @xmath103 ) , with longer timescale of the star formation ( dotted line , @xmath82 ) , and wider region of initial condition ( @xmath319 mpc ) .",
    ", width=226 ]    the initial condition is most important .",
    "the edge of the simulated fields actually falls into a galaxy at @xmath320 depending on the position of the galaxy in the field .",
    "the galaxy mass @xmath321 ( the mass with higher density than @xmath322 ) stops increasing at @xmath323 .",
    "this means that there is an artificial cutoff of mass accretion around this redshift , which results in the cutoff of star formation rate in figure [ fig : sfr ] . in a wider simulation with a radius of @xmath324 mpc ( dashed - line in fig.[fig : param ] ) instead of @xmath175 mpc in the series of our simulation , the star formation continues longer , and thus colors tend to be too blue .",
    "the total luminosity becomes @xmath310 times larger , but still @xmath325 times smaller than the observation . with much wider simulation , the luminosity difference",
    "could be improved , but the color inconsistency become much larger , and such galaxy is no more elliptical . the star formation and",
    "feedback schemes need to be modified accordingly , such as some recent works have tried ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper ,",
    "the mass accretion and star formation are truncated artificially by the initial condition . however , in observed ellipticals , star formation should be truncated at @xmath219 by some process ; tidal stripping , effects of active galactic nuclei , and so on . this epoch may correspond to the epoch when the galaxy falls into a cluster , because the galaxy moves too fast to arise mass accretion .",
    "if we include the contribution of the outside of the simulated field , late accretion and late merging events should increase . both make the metallicity gradient shallow . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : init ] , fields with larger spin parameter @xmath187 are not included in our simulation , and an elliptical can form through major mergers of disk galaxies in some of such fields .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig : gh ] , the predicted metallicity gradients are already in good agreement with the observation , and the increase of merger galaxies conflicts with the observation .",
    "if star formation and feedback schemes improved , evolution of metallicity gradients may also be affected at some extent .",
    "we should note , however , that the following conclusions will not change ; major merger make the metallicity gradients shallow , and there should be non - merger ellipticals to explain the observed steep gradients .",
    "we study the formation and chemodynamical evolution of galaxies with our grape - sph chemodynamical model that includes various physical processes associated with the formation of stellar systems ; radiative cooling , star formation , feedback from sne ii , sne ia , and sws , and chemical enrichment .",
    "we simulate 72 slowly - rotating spherical fields ( spin parameter @xmath202 ) , and obtain 124 galaxies ( 78 ellipticals and 46 dwarfs ) from the cdm initial fluctuation .",
    "all simulated galaxies have the de vaucouleurs surface brightness profiles , and are therefore elliptical galaxies .",
    "most stars in ellipticals form during the initial star burst at @xmath240 , while dwarfs undergo relatively continuous star formation . in our scenario , galaxies form through the successive merging of sub - galaxies .",
    "the merging history is various and the difference is seeded in the initial conditions . in some cases ,",
    "galaxies form through the assembly of gas rich small galaxies , and the process looks like a _ monolithic collapse_. in other cases , the evolved galaxies undergo _ major merger _ of galaxies .",
    "major mergers are defined as those with the mass ratios of the primary and secondary galaxies being @xmath230 .",
    "we examine the physical conditions during 151 merging events that occur in our simulation . whether the merging event changes the metallicity gradient",
    "is mainly influenced by two factors ; the mass ratio of the merging galaxies @xmath232 and the induced star formation .",
    "the basic processes of the formation and evolution of the gradients are summarized below :    * formation of initial gradients  the initial gradient is determined from the initial star burst at @xmath290 .",
    "the gradient is steeper in the case of quiescent gas accretion , and is shallower in the case of violent assembly of subgalaxies . as a result , the initial gradients span from @xmath267}/\\delta\\log r = -1.5 $ ] to @xmath11 . *",
    "destruction by mergers  the major merger changes the orbits of stars .",
    "the metal - rich stars at the center are able to move to the outer region of the galaxy .",
    "the gradient change is determined mainly from the mass ratio of merging galaxies @xmath232 . with larger @xmath232 ,",
    "the gradients become shallower . if the mass ratio of merging galaxies is larger than @xmath326 , the gradient change is larger than @xmath297 dex . *",
    "regeneration due to the induced star formation  if the ratio of gas mass is as large as @xmath327 , strong star formation is induced at the center of the primary galaxy , and the gradient change is smaller than @xmath297 dex . * passive evolution  if the gas fraction of the secondary galaxy is larger than @xmath328 , moderate star formation is induced in the outer region of the primary galaxy , and the gradient change becomes as large as @xmath297 dex , even if @xmath329 . in some case without merging event , if the similar star formation is induced by the late gas accretion , the metallicity gradient gradually becomes shallower .",
    "we succeed in reproducing the observations of metallicity gradients and finding the origin of the variety of internal structures . from the distribution functions of the gradients for different merging histories",
    ", we discuss the origin of elliptical galaxies .    *",
    "the average metallicity gradient is @xmath330 and the dispersion is @xmath1 , which are both consistent with observations of mg@xmath2 gradients . * no correlation is produced between gradients and masses .",
    "the metallicity gradients do not depend on the galaxy mass , and the variety of the gradients stems from the difference in the merging histories ; galaxies that form monolithically have steeper gradients , while galaxies that undergo major mergers have shallower gradients . * the metallicity gradient distributions for [ a ] non - major merger ( [ 1]-[3 ] ) and [ b ] major merger galaxies ( [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] ) are quite different .",
