    "one of the most important discoveries in the study of quantum systems which display chaotic dynamics in the classical limit , was the fact that generically , the spectral statistics obey the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "this observation was originally made on the basis of numerical experiments ( see e.g , @xcite for energy spectra , @xcite for @xmath0-matrix spectra ) , but during the past years it received a much stronger theoretical foundation .",
    "( @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the standard tools for the quantitative study of spectral statistics were the n - point correlation functions , or some functions thereof which were usually chosen because of their suitability in the analysis of finite spectral stretches . in the present work",
    "we would like to propose a different approach , which is based on the study of the statistical properties of the _ spectral determinant _ , sometimes referred to as the _ secular function _ , the _ spectral @xmath1 function _ or the _ characteristic polynomial _ : it is the function which vanishes if and only if its argument belongs to the spectrum .",
    "the spectral determinant , considered as a function of its variable , is defined in terms of coefficients which can be expressed as functions of the eigenvalues .",
    "this is particularly simple for the case of a matrix of finite dimension @xmath2 , where the characteristic polynomial is defined in terms of its coefficients , which , in turn , can be calculated from the spectrum .",
    "thus , the information stored in the spectral function is equivalent to the information stored in the spectrum , and one may ask why should one study the statistics of the former , when the n - point spectral statistics are so well investigated .    in this article",
    "we shall try to show that in fact the correlation function may offer some important advantages for studying the statistics of the spectrum . to name a few :",
    "in general the coefficients in the spectral determinants depend in a complicated way on the spectral points .",
    "sometimes , however , the ensemble averages of these quantities have particularly simple expressions , which are convenient for numerical and theoretical studies .",
    "this was the reason why the essen group @xcite studied the statistical properties of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials for the random circular ensembles .",
    "we would like to emphasize other aspects , which are especially important for establishing the connection between quantum chaos and rmt .",
    "the gutzwiller trace formula , which gives the semiclassical theory for the spectral density , typically diverges .",
    "the derivation of spectral statistics based on this theory , should therefore be augmented by additional assumptions @xcite or ad - hoc truncation procedures @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the semiclassical expression for the spectral determinant involves a finite number of periodic orbits , and therefore it converges on the real energy axis .",
    "the semiclassical spectral determinant preserves another important property , namely , it is explicitly real for real energies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . thus , the semiclassical study of the statistical properties of the spectral determinant can be based on a relatively solid starting point .",
    "last but not least , the semiclassical spectral determinant shares many of its properties with the riemann siegel expression for the riemann @xmath1 function on the critical line .",
    "the autocorrelation function for @xmath3 is the subject of a study of keating _ et al _ @xcite which was carried out in parallel to the present work .",
    "the rigorous results obtained for the @xmath4 case , provide some support to the physically reasonable , ( yet mathematically uncontrolled ) approximations made in the semiclassical theory to be discussed here .",
    "the object we would like to study in the present paper is the autocorrelation function .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the secular function , which vanishes at the spectral points @xmath6 .",
    "the variable @xmath7 can stand for the energy , or for the phase variable when the operator under study is a unitary operator such as a @xmath0 matrix or a unitary evolution operator . consider a domain of size @xmath8 centered about @xmath9 .",
    "the autocorrelation function is defined in terms of    @xmath10    the mean , normalized autocorrelation function is @xmath11 the brackets stand for averaging over an appropriate random matrix ensemble , or for a spectral average which is affected by averaging over @xmath9 .",
    "it is assumed throughout that the correlation variable @xmath12 takes values which are always much smaller than the integration interval @xmath8 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath13 can be intuitively clarified , by considering two extreme cases : an equally spaced ( infinitely rigid ) spectrum produces a correlation function which is a strictly periodic function of @xmath12 , @xmath14 where @xmath12 is measured in units of the level spacing .",
    "on the other hand , a poissonian spectrum with @xmath2 spectral points , yields a positive correlation which decays to zero on a scale which is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "this can be shown by considering the ensemble of diagonal matrices with independent , gaussian random diagonal elements with @xmath16 . with this choice ,",
    "the average level spacing at @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "the correlation function is @xmath19    thus , the lack of correlation between the energy levels , induces a slowly decaying correlation function .",
    "the canonical random ensembles all display level repulsion which induce strong correlations .",
    "it is expected , therefore , that the `` incipient crystalline character '' @xcite of the spectrum of these canonical random matrix ensembles will manifest itself by oscillatory , yet slowly decaying correlation functions .",
    "the more rigid the spectrum ( larger @xmath20 ) , the more marked and persistent will be the oscillations of @xmath13 .    the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the next chapter will be devoted to the derivation of the autocorrelation function for the standard random matrix ensembles .",
    "next , we shall discuss the semiclassical derivation , and compare it to the prediction of rmt .",
    "finally , we shall present some numerical results which were performed to illustrate and to supplement the theoretical derivations .",
    "the autocorrelation function takes a particularly simple form in the case of the circular random ensembles .",
    "moreover , the recent results of the essen group @xcite can be directly used to obtain closed expressions for the autocorrelation function . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we shall briefly summarize the results for the circular ensembles in the first part of this section .",
    "the gaussian ensembles require some more work : correlation functions of the kind we are interested in , were only derived for the unitary ( gue ) ensemble @xcite .",
    "moreover , the semicircular mean spectral density for the gaussian ensembles might introduce irrelevant features in the correlation functions , if they are not properly treated .",
    "the derivation of the autocorrelation function for any gaussian ensemble which interpolates between the goe and the gue , will be given in the second part of this section , together with a discussion of the effects which are due to the non uniform mean spectral density .",
    "fortunately , we find that these effects become less significant as the dimension of the random matrices increases .",
    "the spectrum of a @xmath21 unitary matrix @xmath0 consists of @xmath2 unimodular eigenvalues @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to write the characteristic polynomial such that it is real on the unit circle @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the characteristic polynom can be written down as @xmath25 the autocorrelation function reads now @xmath26 or explicitly , @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for the average with respect to the spectral measure of the orthogonal @xmath29 , unitary @xmath30 or symplectic @xmath31 circular ensembles .",
    "the unitarity imposes the identity @xmath32 which guarantees that the autocorrelation function is real , and reduces the effort needed to calculate the ensemble averages .",
    "the ensemble averages @xmath33 were calculated in @xcite for all values of @xmath20 .",
    "we shall quote here the results for the orthogonal and the unitary ensembles :    @xmath34    it is convenient to introduce the scaled correlation length @xmath35 and in the limit of large @xmath2 the sums in ( [ corrcen ] ) can be approximated as integrals , to give    @xmath36    equation ( [ corrcircle ] ) suggests the following relations between the real correlation functions : @xmath37    the two correlation functions are displayed in fig .",
    "[ exgaus ] .",
    "as expected , the more rigid ensemble ( @xmath38 ) shows stronger correlations than the less rigid ensemble .",
    "the expressions derived above for the circular ensembles appear also when the gaussian ensembles are discussed in the large n limit .",
    "a detailed derivation will follow in the next subsection .      unlike the circular ensembles , the mean spectral densities for the gaussian ensembles are not uniform .",
    "this has to be incorporated in the definition of the correlation function for the gaussian ensembles .",
    "otherwise this spurious behavior may blur the essential correlations . because of this consideration we shall compute the functions    @xmath39    this function should then be normalized by its value at @xmath40 , to get the function @xmath41 , as defined in eq .",

    "indicates an average over the ensembles of hermitian matrices with respect to the measures which will be defined below .    before doing any calculations",
    ", one can get some insight in this function by writing @xmath44 as @xmath45 hence , @xmath44 can be considered as the partition function of a gas of particles at positions @xmath46 , moving in a quadratic potential ( which is provided by the gaussian measures ) and interacting via a logarithmically repulsive interaction with two particles whose positions are fixed at @xmath47 and @xmath48 and which do not interact with each other .",
    "the interaction between the particles at positions @xmath46 themselves depends on the distribution and the symmetry of the random hamiltonian @xmath49 as we will see in more detail below",
    ". it may be useful to come back to this coulomb gas picture of @xmath44 to understand the results whose derivation we present in the following .    for analytical calculations within an ensemble of random matrices , it is more convenient to write each determinant as the functional integral over two sets of n grassmann variables , which greatly simplifies the averaging over the weight of the ensemble : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and with @xmath55 @xmath56 now , the averaging over the random matrices @xmath49 is reduced to a simple gaussian integral , when they are gaussian distributed",
    ". then , performing the grassmann integrals we could find @xmath57 as an int ( n/2 ) -th order polynomial in @xmath58 , and we could compare its coefficients with the ones obtained numerically for the non integrable quantum systems , for arbitrary n. although we succeeded to do this for arbitrary n , it turns out to be more useful to do a saddle point approximation which coincides with the exact result in the limit @xmath59 .    in the present section we shall present a theory which treats the unitary and the orthogonal gaussian random ensembles ( and any interpolating ensemble ) in a unified way .",
    "this is done by writing the hamiltonian as@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a symmetric real matrix , its matrix elements @xmath62 are real numbers @xmath63 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath64 are antisymmetric , @xmath65 and real numbers @xmath66 , since the hamiltonian h has to be hermitian .",
    "the random matrices are distributed with a gaussian measure , @xmath67 where @xmath68 corresponds to a spectrum with mean level spacing set equal to @xmath69 .",
    "note that , @xmath70 corresponds to goe where there is time reversal symmetry , the hamiltonian @xmath49 is symmetric and the distribution is invariant under orthogonal transformations @xmath71 . @xmath72 describes the pure gue where the time reversal symmetry is broken completely and the hamiltonian is hermitian and invariant under unitary transformations @xmath73 .    calculating the correlation function for @xmath74 between 0 and 1",
    ", we obtain the crossover between goe and gue .    using eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) we arrive after performing the gaussian average over the random matrices at : @xmath75 thus , we arrived at an interacting theory with interaction strength @xmath76 .",
    "although the grassmannian functional integrals can be performed exactly , let us treat this expression as one usually does when one encounters an interacting theory : first do a hubbard- stratonovitch transformation . if the resulting decoupled theory can not be solved exactly , do a saddle point approximation .",
    "expansion around the saddle point then leads to a nonlinear sigma model theory which can possibly be integrated out .",
    "the advantage over the exact result turns out to be that the limit @xmath59 can be done more easily and is exact",

    "the choice of @xmath255 is crucial for near optimal performance of the algorithm and we use @xmath256 for @xmath257 and @xmath258 for @xmath259 . for these parameters , approximately fifty percent of the metropolis steps",
    "are accepted .",
    "the initial vector @xmath260 is chosen at random and the transients due to the initial choice are erased after a few iterations since the `` random walker '' @xmath261 advances quickly towards the most probable domain . out of all the vectors",
    "@xmath262 only a small fraction is accepted to the ensemble in order to obtain an uncorrelated sample .",
    "each run generates a set of 2000 properly distributed vectors which are then used for further analysis .",
    "we checked the convergence with respect to the ensemble size , and found that a set of 2000 spectra is sufficiently large to obtain reliable results .",
    "the same algorithm can be used to sample the probability measure of the gaussian ensembles @xmath263 ) .    as the first application , we studied the difference between the autocorrelation functions for the circular ensembles @xmath264 and their corresponding gaussian ensembles for a _ finite",
    "_ dimension @xmath257 .",
    "we used the definitions ( [ corr1 ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) for the autocorrelation functions . for the circular ensemble , the domain of integration is @xmath265 $ ] and for the gaussian ensembles we limited the integration domain to the interval @xmath266 to avoid deformations whose origin is the nonuniform semicircular level density .",
    "[ gauscirc ] shows small yet systematic differences between the gaussian and circular ensembles which are most pronounced for the symplectic and the orthogonal ensembles .",
    "the differences between the unitary ensembles is the smallest .",
    "the overall agreement is rather good , as expected when the limit @xmath267 is approached .",
    "the same trend persists also when one compares the @xmath257 cases for the gaussian ensembles with the expressions derived in section  [ theory ] for @xmath267 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ exgaus ] .",
    "we see again that the @xmath257 data is fairly close to the infinite limit for the gue case . in the goe case the @xmath257 data is significantly different from the @xmath267 limit .",
    "we used two independent ways to treat a given large spectrum . in the first method the large spectrum with @xmath268 eigenvalues",
    "is `` chopped '' to a number of smaller subintervals .",
    "given a large spectrum , one can chop it in various ways , and one has to find a compromise which provides a sufficiently large ensemble of not too short intervals .",
    "we worked with @xmath269 subintervals of @xmath257 eigenvalues .",
    "each subinterval , is unfolded to a mean spacing of 1 and is shifted to be centered around @xmath17 .",
    "this procedure puts the subintervals on an equal footing . for the calculation of the correlation function ,",
    "the integration is limited to @xmath270 .",
    "the ensemble averaged autocorrelation @xmath271 is normalized by @xmath272 .",
    "the calculation of the autocorrelation function is similar to the way by which we used the ma samples which were constructed according to the gaussian measures .",
    "an alternative definition would have been to consider the autocorrelation function of the spectral determinant built from the entire large spectrum .",
    "the definition  ( [ corr1 ] ) will be harder to apply because both the numerator and the denominator diverge with either @xmath273 or @xmath107 .",
    "this difficulty is related to the well known problem of regularization of spectral determinants , and the regularization scheme we have chosen is the following .",
    "we shift the origin of the energy axis to the center of gravity of the large spectrum , and consider the secular function @xmath274 this function is defined also in the limit of @xmath267 as long as the symmetric construction is maintained in the limiting procedure .",
    "however , for finite @xmath2 the function @xmath275 diverge as @xmath276 for sufficiently large @xmath107 .",
    "this can be cured by a regularization factor whose origin can be illustrated by considering the spectral determinant for an equidistant spectrum :    @xmath277    using the asymptotic expressions for the @xmath278 function one gets @xmath279 which is valid for @xmath280 where @xmath281 .",
    "this suggests the definition of a regularized corrected spectral determinant @xmath282 where the @xmath46 are the unfolded , symmetrically centered spectrum .",
    "the autocorrelation function can now be calculated using @xmath283 note that all eigenvalues are used in one run . here",
    "@xmath284 is proportional to @xmath2 , but smaller than @xmath285 as even the regularized spectral determinant is much larger than 1 at the edges of the spectrum .",
    "we arbitrarily used @xmath286 which yields good results .    as long as @xmath2 is finite",
    "the correlation function based on the regularized polynomial can be expressed as @xmath287 thus , the difference between the two definitions of the correlation function comes from the different order of the operations of averaging and normalizing . in fig .",
    "[ regpol ] , we compare the correlation functions obtained by the two averaging methods . the dashed and the solid lines are ma runs for @xmath257 with goe statistics , using the original ( [ corr ] ) and regularized ( [ regcor ] ) definitions , respectively .",
    "the regularized correlation function is less damped , and it resembles the non - regularized function for gue .",
    "( the rmt expression for the correlation function ( [ regcor ] ) for the gue was considered in @xcite )    we have emphasized several times in the discussion above that the expectation value of the autocorrelation function depends on all the @xmath166-point spectral statistics , and therefore does not , in principle , contain any new information .",
    "however , since a typical spectral analysis is usually carried out in terms of only a few statistical measures , it is worth while to check to what extent the information in the autocorrelation function overlaps with the most common statistics - the nearest neighbour distribution @xmath288 .",
    "for this purpose we used the rejection method to generate a random ensemble of spectral sequences , with nearest neighbour spacings which are distributed as @xmath289 , disregarding all other correlations which are implied by the exact coe measure ( [ progaus ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ lespspec1 ] we compare the expectation value of the autocorrelation function for this ensemble , with the proper coe result .",
    "the difference between the two functions shows already at the positions of the first zero crossings , and the depths of the first minima .",
    "these differences are rather large , and establish the sensitivity of the autocorrelation function to correlations between levels which are further apart than the nearest neighbours .      at this point",
    "we turn to the analysis of physical spectra , to check the extent of applicability of the semiclassical and the rmt results .",
    "we used the spectra of sinai billiards in two @xcite and in three dimensions @xcite , for which we have the lowest 2591 and 6698 eigenvalues , respectively .",
    "we analyzed the ( unfolded ) spectra using the two methods mentioned previously .",
    "in the first , the spectra were chopped into subintervals of length @xmath257 , and were centered around @xmath290 .",
    "we thus obtained numerical ensembles consisting of @xmath291 and @xmath292 intervals respectively .",
    "the average autocorrelation functions are compared to the corresponding metropolis data in fig .",
    "[ sinai2 ] and fig .",
    "[ sinai3 ] .",
    "as the number of eigenvalues is quite small for the 2 dimensional sinai billiard , only the first minimum is reproduced correctly .",
    "however , the situation is improved when the larger spectrum for the 3 dimensional billiard is analyzed .    to use the entire spectral data in one run , we defined the correlation function as in ( [ regsin ] ) and applied it to the spectrum of the 2 dimensional sinai billiard , using all eigenvalues in one run . the result is given in fig .",
    "[ regpol ] ( dots ) .",
    "the numerical values agree better with the ma runs for the regularized version .",
    "both show nearly the same damping although the zeros are slightly shifted .",
    "the conclusion we may draw from the comparison of the two methods , is that the regularized version has a built in self - averaging mechanism .",
    "the energy integral represents an averaging over independent parts of the spectrum . at a certain value",
    "@xmath107 only @xmath46 which are close to @xmath107 significantly contribute to the product ( [ regcorpol ] ) .",
    "in this work we tried to emphasize the theoretical and practical advantages of the use of the autocorrelation function of spectral determinants , both as a practical statistical tool and as an alternative route to study the relationship between quantum chaos and rmt . to conclude , we would like to make a few further comments .",
    "one of the most gratifying aspects of the present work was the fact that the correlations of the riemann @xmath1 on the critical line have much in common with the present work , and could be studied using rigorous mathematical tools @xcite .",
    "this provides much more confidence in the ad hoc assumptions which were made in the development of the semiclassical theory .",
    "our work on the rmt expressions for the autocorrelation functions complements the previous results on the circular ensembles @xcite , and the the known results for gue @xcite .",
    "it also provides the expressions for the goe case , and for the ensembles which interpolate between goe and gue .",
    "the semiclassical derivation of the autocorrelation function is new , and enables a close scrutiny of relevance of the classical @xmath1 function to spectral statistics in the semiclassical limit .",
    "it is clear that both functions are derived form the same building blocks - as a matter of fact , their fourier coefficients coincide up to the topological time which corresponds to half the heisenberg time .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent observations of @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical methods which were developed here can also be used for quantum chaotic problems for which the spectral statistics differ from the one expected for the standard dyson ensembles .",
    "such problems are commonly met in applications to mesoscopic systems .",
    "this work was supported by the minerva center for nonlinear physics and the israeli science foundation .",
    "the minerva foundation provided postdoctoral fellowships to sk and dk .",
