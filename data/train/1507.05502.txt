    "in one dimensional disordered systems particles can not freely propagate .",
    "the particle undergoes a series of scattering processes and , as a result of the destructive interference , its density profile decays exponentially .",
    "this phenomenon is called the anderson localization ( al ) @xcite .",
    "al is a single particle effect and therefore can not be observed directly in solids ( because of the strong electron - electron and electron phonon interactions ) .",
    "nevertheless , nowadays many different tight - binding models can be easily implemented and investigated with ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "ultracold atomic systems in optical lattices guarantee a high degree of controllability @xcite , allowing to change experimentally parameters of the model , such as hopping amplitudes using periodic lattice modulations @xcite , or interparticle interaction strength using the magnetic feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "in particular , the interactions can be switched off completely , creating perfect conditions for the investigation of al .",
    "indeed , al of matter waves has been already observed in the laboratory @xcite ( as well as a similar aubry - andr localization @xcite ) .",
    "it is very convenient to study disorder phenomena with optical lattices . in particular",
    ", the diagonal disorder in ultracold systems can be very easily implemented by manipulating on - site energies , e.g. with incommensurate lattices @xcite or interactions with other ( heavy ) species of particles @xcite .",
    "the later method allows to introduce various types of correlations in the disorder distribution , e.g. dual random dimer models ( drdm ) , where two heavy atom never come in pairs ) or @xmath0-mers , where heavy particles always occupy a series of neighboring @xmath0 sites .",
    "@xmath0-mer correlations have been studied in various systems such as photons in dielectric waveguide @xcite , acoustic waves @xcite or electrons in crystalline lattice @xcite .",
    "the off - diagonal disorder arises quite naturally , as the differences in the on - site energies change the tunneling amplitude values . as such",
    ", the off - diagonal disorder is correlated with the diagonal disorder and its relative amplitude is small . on the contrary , in this paper we present a theoretical scheme allowing to control the off - diagonal disorder strength in an experiment ( for the drdm case see @xcite ) .    in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe a tight binding model with the binary disorder in both on - site energies and tunneling strengths . also , the methods of creating such a system using ultracold atoms in optical lattices is sketched . in section [ sec : nmer ] we describe a method employing transfer matrices to find resonant energies in the systems with binary correlated disorder , and use it to calculate positions of all transparent states in the case of @xmath0-mers with no off - diagonal disorder . in section [ sec : off ]",
    "we extend our analysis to include the diagonal - off - diagonal correlated disorder .",
    "we derive an equation for the resonant energies , discuss the asymptotic behavior and compare the results with numerical calculations of the localization length .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sec : drdm ] we describe a dual random dimer model ( being a @xmath1-mer model with off - diagonal correlated disorder ) .",
    "again , we find @xcite transparent modes , present an approximate expression for the localization length and compare the results with the numerical calculations . in the appendix , a detailed description of the floquet formalism used to derive effective hamiltonian with off - diagonal disorder is presented .",
    "consider a non - interacting tight - binding one dimensional hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3(@xmath4 ) is an operator of particle annihilation ( creation ) at site @xmath5 , @xmath6 a particle number operator and @xmath7 are on - site energies ( we set @xmath8 and use tunneling amplitude as an energy scale ) .",
    "the binary disorder occurs when @xmath9 are random numbers and take only two values : @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "because of its simplicity , the binary disordered models serve as a playground for studying the localization and transport properties .    to create the binary disorder in an optical lattice one can use two species of atoms repulsively interacting with each other .",
    "we allow only one fraction of atoms to move freely on the lattice , while the second one is trapped in the lattice sites ( we call them _ frozen _ and denote with a @xmath12 superscript ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by a hamiltonian h= _",
    "i(v_0 n^f_i n_i- ( a^_i a_i+1 + ) ) , where we eliminated interactions between the _ mobile _ particles ( experimentally , one can switch them off by the optical or microwave feshbach resonance @xcite or use spin polarized fermions ) .",
    "as @xmath13 is fixed , we can treat @xmath14 as an effective on - site energy @xmath7 . furthermore , if the _ frozen _ particles are fermions or strongly repelling ( hard - core ) bosons , then their occupation per a lattice site @xmath15 is either zero or one and hence the on - site energies take only two values @xmath16 .    the strength of the interspecies interaction @xmath17 can be changed in an experiment by applying a proper magnetic field @xmath18 , which is close to the value of the feshbach resonance . in our scheme ,",
    "we choose the magnetic field to be time periodic @xmath19 , in such a way that the interactions are changing harmonically : _ i _",
    "i(t)=n^f_i(v_0+v_1(t ) ) .",
    "as changing the magnetic field in a vicinity of the feshbach resonance leads to rapid changes of the interaction strength , the relative values of @xmath17 and @xmath20 can be chosen at will in a broad range of values . in this way",
    "we obtain a time - dependent hamiltonian : h(t)=_i ( n^f_i(v_0+v_1(t ) ) n_i - ( a^_i a_i+1 + ) ) .",
    "if the modulation frequency @xmath21 is bigger than other energy scales in system ( @xmath22 ) then , by the means of the floquet theory , one can average out fast oscillating terms and find an effective hamiltonian governing the long term dynamics of the system ( see appendix ) : h_eff=_i(_i n_i - t_i ( a^_i a_i+1 + ) ) , [ eq : h3 ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a renormalized hopping . for a binary case @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 varies from 1 to about -0.4 ( to the minimum of the bessel function , @xmath28 ) .",
    "due to anderson theory of localization in one dimensional system all states should be localized , unless disorder have some correlations . in the binary disordered systems correlations",
    "can take a form of @xmath0-mers where _ frozen _",
    "particles always come in series of length @xmath0 , or dual random dimer model ( drdm ) where no two _ frozen _ particles can appear on the adjacent sites .",
    "such correlations can be created by using several lattices with different lattice constants ( as described for the case of the drdm in @xcite ) .",
    "a transfer matrix method is a very effective tool for the numerical computation of the localization length @xcite .",
    "the formalism can be also used to find analytically the delocalized modes that are appearing in systems with the correlated binary disorder .",
    "a transfer matrix for a system described by has a form : (    c_i+1 + _ i    ) =(    c c & - + 1&0    ) (    c_i + _",
    "i-1    ) t_i (    c_i + _",
    "i-1    ) , where @xmath29 is an energy of a state . iterating the procedure : (    c_j+1 + _ j    ) = t_j  t_i (    c_i + _",
    "i-1    ) t_i^j (    c_i + _",
    "i-1    ) . in our analysis",
    ", we consider systems with binary disordered correlations in a form of @xmath0-mers where _ frozen _",
    "particles always come in series of length @xmath0 .",
    "all such blocks have the same internal structure - it is the distribution of them which is random .",
    "therefore , one can study transfer matrix of single block ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( i.e. @xmath32 ) to get some insight in the transport properties of the whole system . for the case of an @xmath0-mer with uniform tunnelings ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "such a matrix can be written explicitly : [ eq : tmnmer ] t^i+n_i+1 t^n()= (    c cw_n ( ) & -w_n-1 ( ) + w_n-1()&-w_n-2 ( )    ) , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a polynomial of the @xmath36-th order given by a recursive formula : [ eq : recc ] w_n()= -w_n-1 ( ) -w_n-2 ( ) , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . solving the equation we can get an explicit expression : w_m()=_k=0^m/2 (    m - k + k    ) ( -1)^k+m^m-2k .",
    "in particular , a transfer matrix for a system without disorder ( for an arbitrary number of sites ) reads [ eq : tmfree ] t^m(e)= (    c cw_m(e ) & -w_m-1(e ) + w_m-1(e)&-w_m-2(e )    ) . we can compare a free transfer matrix with the @xmath0-mer transfer matrix @xmath39",
    "if the condition is met for some energy @xmath40 , then we can say that for a state with such an energy the @xmath0-mer disordered system has the same transport properties as a free system .",
    "hence , this state is delocalized .",
    "such a procedure can be easily extended to any kind of correlations in a form of randomly distributed blocks with fixed internal structure , not necessarily @xmath0-mers .    a problem of finding transparent modes for binary disordered system with @xmath0-mer correlations can be fully solved by writing explicitly equations , using and the fact that determinant of @xmath41 is one ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "then , it can be shown that the only nontrivial solutions ( i.e. @xmath43 ) of the equation exist if [ eq : w_cond ] w_n-1(e - v_0)=0 , therefore a problem of finding resonant energies is reduced to finding zeros of the polynomial @xmath44 .",
    "it immediately follows that : t^n(e_r - v_0)= (    cc1&0 + 0&1    ) , which means that is trivially satisfied for @xmath45 .",
    "it turns our that a @xmath0-mer problem has @xmath46 resonant energies ( this result , from a different approach , has been first presented in @xcite ) : [ eq : er ] e_r = v_0 + 2(i ) i\\{1 ,  ,",
    "n-1}. the additional condition for the appearance of extended states is that its energy has to lie in the energy band for a system without disorder ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the properties of the system change dramatically if we add the off - diagonal disorder , as in .",
    "the off - diagonal disorder arises naturally in the model , as the differences in the on - site energies alter the hooping terms , but usually their values are small comparing to the diagonal disorder .",
    "nevertheless , in our approach we can independently manipulate the values of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder . for the @xmath0-mer , due to , only the edge tunneling amplitudes",
    "are changed : @xmath48 ( we assume here that @xmath0-mers are separated by at least one empty site ) . to obtain a transfer matrix of the @xmath0-mer",
    ", we need to write a transfer matrix for @xmath49 sites ( since the altered tunneling amplitudes @xmath50 appear in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 we have to include two extra matrices ) : ^n()t_i^i+n+1 = t_i+n+1t_i+n _ t^n-2()t_i+1t_i , resulting in ( where we denote the matrix elements with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 for the later convenience ) ^n ( ) = , where @xmath58 it is straightforward to check that a condition [ eq : transfer_m_tylda ] ^n()=t^m(e ) is not satisfied by energies given by . to fully solve the equation",
    ", we use the same procedure as in section [ sec : nmer ] .",
    "we assume that fulfill a recursive formula : [ eq : v_rec_eq ] v_n = -e v_n-1 -v_n-2 .",
    "it is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the resonance , as we do not know if there exist @xmath59 such that is satisfied ( in other words , we do not know if initial conditions of meet that of ) .    from we",
    "can get an equation for zeros of polynomial of @xmath0-th order in @xmath60 : [ eq : tunnelingsresonance ] ( ( 1-t^2)-t^2v_0)w_n-1()+(1-t^4)w_n-2()=0 .",
    "first , we can analyze limiting cases : for @xmath33 we restore the equation , so the approach is consistent with the one presented in section [ sec : nmer ] . in the case of @xmath61",
    "we get @xmath62 , so the resonances can appear for the same energies as for the @xmath63-mer with uniform tunnelings .",
    "the case of @xmath64 is trivial , as the chain is broken into pieces , and hence no transport can occur .",
    "still , we can find that comes down to @xmath65 , so for @xmath66 the resonant energies approach those of the @xmath67-mer .",
    "solving numerically gives always @xmath0 solutions , for @xmath68 one of them diverges and the rest converges to @xmath46 solutions for the @xmath0-mer with uniform tunnelings . if @xmath69 two edge solutions diverge and the rest of them go asymptotically to the solutions for the @xmath63-mer .",

    "for @xmath73 situation is ambiguous , the equation is satisfied , but we are unable to find @xmath74 for which @xmath75 .",

    "[ fig : plot1 ] we present numerically calculated anderson localization lengths ( using the standard transfer matrix method , see e.g. @xcite ) for the 4-mer and the mean occupation @xmath82 , the strength of disorder is set to @xmath83 .",

    "all the above analysis was valid for @xmath0-mers with @xmath85 , the case of @xmath1-mer is special .",
    "for the case of uniform tunnelings @xmath33 it does not have any delocalized modes  which is obvious as it is just the uncorrelated disorder .",
    "even if we add an auxiliary condition that no two _ frozen _ particles can occupy adjacent sites ( which is equivalent to a condition of separation of @xmath0-mers ) , situation does not change  it follows trivially from .",
    "however if @xmath73 , we get the so called dual random dimer model ( drdm ) . it has been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "such a model has the resonant energy e_r= , [ rezonans_drdm ] for which : ^1(e_r - v_0)=t^3(e_r ) is satisfied .",
    "as @xmath74 is finite , this resonance is similar to resonances for @xmath0-mers with uniform tunnelings rather than for case with @xmath73 .",
    "the resonance ( [ rezonans_drdm ] ) is present as long as the resonant energy lies withing the band width @xmath86 which is equivalent to the condition : @xmath87 .",
    "the presence of the resonant mode results in the divergence of the al length . in the limit of a small disorder ( both diagonal @xmath88 and off - diagonal @xmath89 ) it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for the inverse localization length @xcite @xmath90 where we substituted @xmath91 for an eigenenergy @xmath29 , and @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the mean occupation number of _ frozen _ particles .",

    "in this work we have described a method of preparing the binary disorder in optical lattices using two atomic species . in such systems",

    "consequently , effective values of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder can be changed independently in a broad range . in order to observe single particle localization , we assume that either our mobile particles are spin polarized fermions or that we switch off interactions using the optical feshbach resonance .",
    "we made a detailed analysis of the localization properties in systems with the disorder with correlations in a form of @xmath0-mers , especially determining the resonant energies for which the unobstructed transport through the system occurs .",
    "for that purpose , we employed the transfer matrix formalism . in this way , we restored a known result in the case of no off - diagonal disorder @xcite .",
