    "single field slow - roll inflation  @xcite successfully accounts for many of the observed properties of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , including the near scale invariance of the power spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations that seed the observed cmb anisotropies  @xcite . although one could claim that a large subset of the simplest models of single field inflation remain perfectly compatible with current cmb precision measurements  @xcite , a direct and accurate reconstruction of the primordial spectrum from cmb data is still limited by various degeneracies in the priors and systematics adopted in our reconstructions  @xcite",
    ". it may certainly be the case that the cmb data implies the presence of various features in the primordial power spectrum other than the nearly scale invariant power law parametrization anticipated from the simplest single field slow roll models  @xcite .",
    "upcoming data , such as that from the planck satellite promises to provide new handles on the overall shape of the spectrum and , particularly in combination with other data sets , could help us determine the precise nature of any possible features in it .",
    "if present , such features could lead to quantitative new tests on the single field slow - roll paradigm  @xcite and constitute strong evidence in favour of the existence of additional degrees of freedom present during the evolution of density perturbations as the universe inflated .",
    "one particularly compelling possibility which we wish to discuss in this report is of features in the spectrum generated by heavy ( relative to the scale of inflation ) degrees of freedom which do not necessarily decouple from the dynamics of the inflaton . although the effects of massive degrees of freedom on the density perturbations are known to quickly dissipate during inflation , there are evidently still a number of contexts where features in the primordial spectrum due to heavy physics can survive .",
    "it is well understood , for example , that departures from a bunch - davies vacuum as the initial condition for the scalar fluctuations will result in oscillatory features in the power spectrum ( see for example refs .",
    "other contexts in which features are generated in the power spectrum involve particle production during brief intervals much smaller than an @xmath7-fold as the universe inflates .",
    "examples of this include those situations where a massive field coupled to the inflaton suddenly becomes massless at a specific point in field space  @xcite .",
    "here it is the transfer of energy out of the inflaton field and the subsequent backscatter of its fluctuations off the condensate of created quanta that can result in features in the power spectrum , as well as in its higher moments @xcite .",
    "yet another context where such features have been shown to arise is in chain inflation , where instead of slowly rolling down a smooth continuous potential , the inflaton field gradually tunnels a succession of many vacua  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present report is to demonstrate the existence of , and to understand the general conditions under which features in the power spectrum result in the context of inflation embedded in a multi - scalar field theory ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for other recent discussions on this ) . for this",
    "we consider models of inflation where all of the scalar fields remain heavy except for one ( the inflaton ) which rolls slowly in some multi - dimensional potential .",
    "an effective field theory analysis tells us that in such scenarios , inflation should proceed in exactly the same way as in the single field case , with subleading corrections suppressed by the masses of the heavy scalar fields ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this framework",
    "it is easy to take for granted that a simple truncation of any available heavy degrees of freedom is the same as having integrated them out .",
    "however , it can certainly be the case that the adiabatic approximation is no longer valid at some point along the inflaton trajectory ( e.g. due to a `` sudden '' turn that mixes heavy and light directions ) , and higher derivative operators in the effective theory are no longer negligible even as inflation continues uninterrupted .    in various models of inflation in supergravity and string",
    "theory , the inflaton is embedded in a non - linear sigma model with typical field manifold curvatures of the string or planck scale  @xcite . in this type of scenario",
    "the inflaton traverses a curvilinear trajectory generating derivative interactions between the adiabatic and non - adiabatic modes  @xcite . in this context , it is straightforward to appreciate heuristically that a sudden enough turn can excite modes normal to the trajectory and non - trivially modify the evolution of the adiabatic mode .",
    "we will see that the net effect of this trajectory will translate into damped oscillatory features superimposed on the power spectrum ",
    "the transients after a sudden transfer of energy between the excited heavy modes and the much lighter inflaton mode , and the subsequent re - scattering of its perturbations off the condensate of heavy quanta that redshift in short time .",
    "a typical potential exhibiting such a curved trajectory is depicted in figure  [ figure - pot ] .",
    "it can be appreciated that there is always a heavy direction transverse to the loci of minima determining the inflaton trajectory .",
    "we should emphasise however that the focus of this work is more general and that a curved trajectory in field space is not exclusively due to the shape of the potential , but also depends on the particular sigma model metric defining the scalar field manifold : on a particular curve the two can be transformed into each other by suitable field redefinitions . with this perspective , curved trajectories appear in any situation where a mismatch exists between the span of geodesics of the scalar field manifold and the actual inflationary trajectory enforced by the scalar potential through the equations of motion  @xcite .",
    "the previously described situation is in fact generic of realisations of inflation in the context of string compactifications , where a large number of scalar fields are expected to remain massive but with their vacuum expectation values depending on the field value of the background inflaton  @xcite .",
    "limits of certain cases we wish to study in this report have been explored recently in seemingly different , but related contexts . in refs .",
    "@xcite for instance , the effects on density perturbations due to a circular turn with constant curvature in field space was explored within a two - field model .",
    "there , it was concluded that such a turn could render non - gaussian features in the bispectrum but would not generate features in the power spectrum . in another recent publication  @xcite",
    ", the effects of a sigma model with non - canonical kinetic terms motivated by string theory was explored within inflationary models where one of the fields remained very massive . there , an effective theory was derived describing the multi - field dynamics , characterised by having a speed of sound for the fluctuations smaller than unity ( and therefore indicating the possible departure from gaussianity of the cmb temperature anisotropies ) . in the framework we are about to discuss , both examples are just different faces of the same coin : while a non - canonical sigma model metric can always be made locally flat along a given trajectory generally generating contributions to the potential with a curved locus of minima , it is also possible to find a field redefinition which makes the loci of flat directions of the potential look straight at the cost of introducing a non - canonical metric .    as we will shortly demonstrate , the parameter determining how relevant a local turn in the background inflaton trajectory is for the effective dynamics of the adiabatic mode is given by the departure from unity of the quantity @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the speed of the inflaton background field , @xmath10 is the radius of curvature of the curve in field space and @xmath11 is the mass of the direction normal to the trajectory . keeping in mind that during slow - roll inflation , the inflaton velocity is given by @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the usual slow roll parameter , it follows that @xmath14 .",
    "thus , even with @xmath15 , if the radius of curvature describing the turn is small enough , significant imprints of heavy physics on the dynamics of the adiabatic mode can arise . more generally , whenever @xmath16 , some amount of particle creation takes place that backreacts on the dynamics of the adiabatic mode .",
    "let us not forget that in addition to the scale invariance of the power spectrum , single field slow - roll inflation predicts that the observed cmb temperature anisotropies seeded by the curvature perturbation satisfy gaussian statistics to a high degree of accuracy  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the class of models examined in this work , if the normal direction to the inflaton trajectory is sufficiently massive ( @xmath15 ) , it is possible to compute an effective action for the adiabatic mode capturing the relevant operators of the full multi - field dynamics .",
    "this effective theory has the characteristic that the adiabatic mode propagates with a speed of sound given by @xmath17 and therefore becomes a functional of ( the curvature of ) the trajectory traversed by the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this result has as a special case the particular context of ref .",
    "@xcite and indicates the presence of non - gaussian signatures correlated with features in the power spectrum",
    ". relates as a specific realisation of our analysis .",
    "this is easiest seen through comparing expressions ( 23 ) in ref  @xcite with ( [ betadef1 ] ) or ( [ betadef2 ] ) here .",
    "we emphasise that the non - decoupling effect , ascribed in these two papers to the non - trivial sigma model metric , is simply due to the non - geodesic nature of the trajectory obtained by putting the heavy field at its local minimum . ]",
    "we have organised this paper in the following way . in section  [ sec2 : setup ]",
    "we present the general setup and the notations used throughout this work . there",
    ", we will emphasise the need for using a geometric perspective to describe the evolution of the homogeneous background . then in section  [ sec3 : perturbations ] we proceed to examine the perturbations of the fields around a time dependent background , and consider their quantisation and provide general formulas for the power spectrum .",
    "our formalism allows us to consider situations beyond the regime of applicability of existing methods , such as trajectories with fast , sudden turns ( regardless of whether the sigma model metric is canonical or non - canonical ) , and any other situations in which the masses in the orthogonal direction are changing relatively fast along the trajectory while still remaining much heavier than @xmath18 . in section  [ two - field - power ]",
    "we apply the previous results to the particular case of two - field models .",
    "we also deduce an effective theory valid in the case where the field normal to the trajectory remains heavy and compare the spectrum of this effective , single - field theory with those found in the full , multi - field computation of the spectrum .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - results ] we examine in detail the evolution of adiabatic and non - adiabatic modes along the curved inflaton trajectory and compute the power spectrum for various cases . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we provide our concluding remarks .",
    "[ sec2 : setup ]    let us start our study by recalling some of the basic aspects of multi - field inflation and by introducing the notations and conventions that will be used throughout this work .",

    "the scalar fields may be thought of as coordinates on @xmath26 with christoffel symbols given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 are partial derivatives with respect to the scalar fields @xmath20 . in terms of these",

    "we should keep in mind that , typically , there will be an energy scale @xmath33 associated to the curvature of @xmath26 , and hence , fixing the typical mass scale of the ricci scalar as @xmath34 . in many concrete situations , such as the modular sector of string compactifications",
    ", the scale @xmath33 corresponds to the planck mass @xmath35 .",
    "the equations of motion for the scalar fields are given by ^a + ^a_b c g^ _ ^b _",
    "^c = v^a , [ scalar - equation-1 ] where @xmath36 . in what follows we discuss in detail the homogeneous solutions @xmath37 to these equations where the scalar fields depend only on time .",
    "the discussion in the sequel follows closely the analysis in @xcite .",
    "we look for background solutions by assuming that all the scalar fields are time dependent @xmath37 , and that spacetime consists of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry of the form @xmath38 later on we will also work in conformal time @xmath39 , defined through the relation @xmath40 . in this background , the equation of motion ( [ scalar - equation-1 ] ) describing the evolution of the scalar fields",
    "is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hubble parameter characterising the expansion rate of spatial slices , and where we have also introduced the convenient notation @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , the friedmann equation describing the evolution of the scale factor in terms of the scalar field energy density is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "notice that @xmath46 corresponds to the rate of change of the scalar field vacuum expectation value along the trajectory followed by the background fields .",
    "it is also convenient to recall the following equation describing the variation of @xmath47 @xmath48 which may be deduced by combining ( [ scal - eq-1 ] ) and ( [ friedmann - eq-1 ] ) . by specifying the metric @xmath27 and the scalar potential @xmath49 , these equations can be solved to obtain the curved trajectory in @xmath26 followed by the scalar fields . to discuss several features of this trajectory without explicitly solving the previous equations ,",
    "it is useful to define unit vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 distinguishing tangent and normal directions to the trajectory respectively , in such a way that @xmath52 . these are defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , denoting the orientation of @xmath51 with respect to the vector @xmath55 .",
    "that is , if @xmath56 then @xmath51 is pointing in the same direction as @xmath55 , whereas if @xmath57 then @xmath51 is pointing in the opposite direction .",
    "due to the presence of the square root , it is clear that @xmath51 is only well defined at intervals where @xmath58 .",
    "however , since @xmath59 may become zero at finite values of @xmath60 , we allow @xmath61 to flip signs each time this happens in such a way that both @xmath51 and @xmath62 remain a continuous function of @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that the sign of @xmath63 may be chosen conventionally at some initial time @xmath64 , but from then on it is subject to the equations of motion respected by the background .",
    "are analytic functions of time , and therefore we disregard any situation where this procedure can not be performed . ] in the particular case where @xmath26 is two dimensional , the presence of @xmath65 in ( [ eq : def - t - n ] ) is sufficient for @xmath51 to have a fixed orientation with respect to @xmath50 ( either left - handed or right - handed ) .",
    "this will become particularly useful when we examine two dimensional models in section [ two - field - power ] .",
    "observe that the tangent vector @xmath50 offers an alternative way of defining the total time derivative @xmath66 along the trajectory followed by the scalar fields .",
    "this is : @xmath67 now , taking a total time derivative to @xmath50 , we may use the equation of motion ( [ scal - eq-1 ] ) to write @xmath68 then , by projecting this equation along the two orthogonal directions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we obtain the following two independent equations @xmath69 where we have defined @xmath70 and @xmath71 to be the projections of @xmath72 along the tangent and normal directions respectively .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that @xmath73 lies entirely along a space spanned by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "that is , we are allowed to write @xmath74 . to anticipate the study of inflation within the present setup ,",
    "it is useful to define the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath75 we will not assume that these parameters are small until much later , where inflation is studied in the slow - roll regime ( see section  [ section : slow - roll ] ) . similarly to the case of @xmath76 , the vector @xmath77 may be decomposed entirely in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 as @xmath78 where we have used ( [ scal - eq-1 ] ) to simplify a few expressions .",
    "observe that @xmath79 is directly related to the rate of change of the tangent unit vector @xmath50 , since ( [ eq - mot - t - n-1 ] ) can be written as @xmath80 comparison with ( [ eq : def - t - n ] ) shows that @xmath81 .",
    "this is one of our main reasons for having introduced @xmath65 in ( [ eq :",
    "def - t - n ] ) : it allows us to keep @xmath79 continuous and avoid some unnecessary difficulties encountered in the definition of isocurvature modes .",
    "is introduced but with a fixed sign , which if the ` slow turn ' approximation were to be violated ( a regime we are mainly interested in ) , would produce a numerical overshoot in the evolution of curvature and isocurvature perturbations that has to be taken into account , and is naturally accounted for by our definition . ]    moving on with this discussion , we can relate @xmath79 to the radius of curvature @xmath10 characterising the bending of the trajectory followed by the scalar fields . to do so , let us recall that given a curve @xmath82 in field space parameterised by @xmath83 , we may define the radius of curvature @xmath10 associated to that curve through the following relation : @xmath84 here @xmath10 stands for the radius of curvature in the scalar manifold @xmath85 spanned by the @xmath20 fields , and therefore it has dimension of mass .",
    "figure  [ fig - n - t - k ] shows the relation between the pair of vectors @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the radius of curvature @xmath10 . using ( [ dt - td ] ) and comparing the last two equations we find the following relation between @xmath10 and @xmath79 : @xmath86    , the normal vector @xmath51 and the radius of curvature @xmath10 . ]    by definition any geodesic curve @xmath82 in @xmath26 satisfies the relation @xmath87 , which corresponds to the case @xmath88 , or alternatively , to the case @xmath89 .",
    "thus , we see that the dimensionless parameter @xmath79 is a useful quantity that parameterises the bending of the inflationary trajectory with respect to geodesics in @xmath26 .",
    "it is interesting to rewrite the previous relation by replacing @xmath90 coming from the definition of @xmath13 presented in ( [ def - slow - roll - parameters ] ) .",
    "one obtains : @xmath91 then , if the radius of curvature is such that @xmath92 , one already sees that @xmath93 .",
    "we shall come back to this result later when we study curved trajectories in the slow - roll regime @xmath94 . to continue , we may further characterise the variation of @xmath51 as : @xmath95 where we have defined the projector tensor @xmath96 along the space orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the unit vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "that is , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "details on how to obtain the previous relation can be found in appendix  [ background - app ] .",
    "observe that in the particular case where @xmath26 is two dimensional , one has @xmath99 and therefore @xmath100 identically .",
    "to finish this section , let us state some useful relations that will be used throughout the rest of this work .",
    "first , by using the definitions for @xmath13 and @xmath101 in ( [ def - slow - roll - parameters ] ) , we may rewrite the background equations ( [ friedmann - eq-1 ] ) and ( [ eq - mot - sigma ] ) respectively as : @xmath102 with the help of ( [ def - slow - roll - parameters ] ) these two relations may be put together to yield : @xmath103 next , by deriving ( [ eq - mot - sigma ] ) with respect to time and using the definitions for @xmath13 and @xmath101 , we deduce @xmath104 both ( [ first - slow - cond ] ) and ( [ second - slow - cond ] ) are exact equations linking the evolution of background quantities with the scalar potential @xmath49 .",
    "it may be already noticed that if @xmath13 , @xmath101 and @xmath105 are all much smaller than unity , then we obtain the usual relations for the slow roll parameters @xmath13 and @xmath101 in terms of derivatives of the potential : @xmath106 we shall come back to these relations later , when we consider the evolution of the background in the slow roll regime .",
    "[ sec3 : perturbations ]    the notation introduced in the previous section provides a useful tool to analyse perturbations @xmath107 about the background solution @xmath37 by decomposing them into parallel and normal components with respect to the inflaton trajectory . in what follows",
    "we proceed to study the evolution and quantisation of these perturbations .",
    "first , we consider scalar field perturbations by expanding about the background @xmath108 . it is well known that the equations of motion for the perturbed fields can be cast entirely in terms of the gauge - invariant mukhanov - sasaki variables  @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the curvature perturbation of the spatial metric .",
    "the equations of motion for these fields are found to be  @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the spatial laplacian and where we have defined the tensor @xmath113 as : @xmath114 we notice here that @xmath115 is symmetric .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the set of equations ( [ pert - eq-1 ] ) in terms of perturbations orthogonal to each other . with this in mind , we introduce a complete set of vielbeins @xmath116 and work with the following quantities : @xmath117 the @xmath118-index labels the abstract scalar manifold @xmath85 whereas the @xmath119-index labels a local orthogonal frame moving along the inflationary trajectory .",
    "recall that vielbeins are defined to satisfy the basic relations @xmath120 and @xmath121 . from these relations",
    "one deduces the identities @xmath122 from which it is possible to read @xmath123 where we have defined the antisymmetric matrix @xmath124 as : @xmath125 before writing down the equations of motion respected by the fields @xmath126 , it is useful to notice that the matrix @xmath127 allows us to define a new covariant derivative @xmath128 acting on quantities such as @xmath126 labelled with the @xmath119-index in the following way where @xmath129 are the usual spin connections for non - coordinate basis , hence justifying the definition of the new covariant derivative of ( [ def - d - x-2 ] ) . ] : @xmath130 this definition allows us to rearrange ( [ q - dot-1 ] ) and  ( [ q - dot-2 ] ) and simply write @xmath131 thus , the equations of motion for the perturbations in the new basis become @xmath132 where @xmath133 . to deal with the above set of equations , it is convenient to take one last step in simplifying them and rewrite them in terms of conformal time @xmath134 , and a new set of perturbations @xmath135 .",

    "figure  [ fig - plots - toy - model ] also shows the power spectrum obtained for the two described cases ( right panels ) . in the present examples ,",
    "the features appearing in the spectrum are not as regular as those of figure  [ figura-3 ] .",
    "this is mainly because in the present situation the curvilinear trajectory contains several turns , in order to go back to the attractor solution .",
    "although in this specific model the slow - roll parameter @xmath101 appears to be sensitive to the mass scale @xmath11 and the curves taking place , it is important to notice that this is a model dependent characteristic , and that in general @xmath101 may show various types of behaviour depending on the sigma model metric and the potential . in general , however , the momentary time variation of @xmath101 due to curved trajectories does not spoil the slow - roll regime , and background fields tend to quickly evolve back to the attractor behaviour characteristic of the single field case as soon as the bending of the trajectory stops . in this regard , we find that the time variation of @xmath101 is not relevant for the appearance of features in the power spectrum , and that the main contribution is that coming from the derivative interactions due to @xmath79 in the equations of motion .",
    "we briefly elaborate here on another potentially observable feature not already discussed .",
    "the previous section computed the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation for a few examples where the inflaton traverses sufficiently curved regions in field space .",
    "from the results , it is clear that features in the spectrum will result each time the trajectory traverses a bend .",
    "these features are produced via the kinetic interaction between the heavy isocurvature modes and the light curvature mode as the turns are traversed by the background field .",
    "crucially in these examples the heavy mode remained very massive throughout ( @xmath15 ) , highlighting the fact that heavy fields may not always be disregarded ( truncated ) when computing the spectrum for adiabatic modes .",
    "what is important to note is that the interaction between curvature and isocurvature modes implies a change in the speed of sound for the curvature perturbations as long as @xmath15 , then @xmath355 is effectively @xmath352-independent before horizon crossing and the speed of sound may be written as @xmath420 as is well known , a model with a speed of sound significantly smaller than unity gives rise to a noticeable level of non - gaussianity of equilateral type , characterised by the non - linear parameter  @xcite : @xmath421 thus , we are led to reason that for generic models of inflation with curvilinear trajectories in a multi - dimensional field space , glitches in the power spectrum are accompanied by a correlated enhancement of non - gaussianity of the equilateral type , provided that the turns in the inflaton trajectory violate the adiabatic approximation vigorously enough a phenomenon which we have argued occurs at various points in field space in many realistic realisations of inflation .",
    "thus although there appear to be many models where either non - trivial modulations in the power spectrum ( e.g. features in the single field inflaton potential  @xcite ) or large equilateral non - gaussianity ( e.g. dbi inflation  @xcite ) result , it appears that in generic multi - field models with curved inflationary trajectories , both are present and correlated .",
    "evidently , the effective quadratic action ( [ action - effective ] ) contains the leading higher order corrections which can also result in non - gaussian signatures and implies the non - linear parameter ( [ equi_fnl ] )  @xcite .",
    "however to fully describe the bispectrum associated with the curvature perturbation , we need to properly take into account the cubic order action including gravity .",
    "we will discuss this issue in a separate publication .",
    "multi - field models of inflation contain a range of physics which goes beyond that encountered within the single - field paradigm . in this work",
    "we have focused on the particular case where all of the scalar fields remain massive during inflation except for one , which slowly rolls down the multi - field potential .",
    "we have found that curved inflationary trajectories can generate significant features in the primordial spectrum of density perturbations arising from normal modes becoming excited and backreacting on the dynamics of the adiabatic mode .    to achieve these results we analysed the evolution of the quantum perturbations of a general multi - field setup , including the presence of a non - canonical kinetic term .",
    "our methods are completely general and naturally incorporate those implemented in previous works  @xcite , where stochastic gaussian variables are used .",
    "moreover , although the main focus of this work was the study of systems where there exists a hierarchy , our results may be used to study a wide range of situations , including where no such hierarchies are present .",
    "our formalism allows us to consider time - dependent situations beyond the regime of applicability of existing methods , such as inflaton trajectories with fast , sudden turns ( regardless of whether the sigma model metric is canonical or non - canonical ) as well as more general situations in which the masses of the heavy fields in the orthogonal direction are changing along the trajectory ( even if they still remain much heavier than @xmath18 and all other scales of interest ) . additionally , we wish to emphasise that these non - decoupling effects have their origin in the non - geodesic nature of the trajectories in field space .",
    "our results highlight the limitations of simply truncating heavy physics when modelling single - field realisations of inflation and show under which circumstances high energy effects can leave an imprint on the power spectrum .",
    "the main reason behind these effects is the existence of kinetic couplings between adiabatic and non - adiabatic modes , emerging as the inflationary trajectory suffers a turn . as we have seen in section [ canonical - frame ] , it is always possible to change basis to a canonical frame where such interactions are absent . in that case",
    ", the eigenvectors of the perturbation mass matrix quickly vary as the inflationary trajectory turns , and we are left with the alternative point of view by which these high energy effects appear due to a violation of the adiabatic condition for truncating heavy fields .",
    "in fact , if the heavy fields are sufficiently massive , we find that we can construct an effective field theory for the adiabatic modes encapsulating the relevant effects of the full multi - field dynamics",
    ". as we have seen , such effects are not mere corrections to the standard single field theory , but represent entirely new contributions to the quadratic action for perturbations .",
    "we find particularly noteworthy , the presence of potentially observable signatures that result from a reduced speed of sound for the adiabatic perturbations during sudden turns . as a corollary , correlated non - gaussianity",
    "will also manifest as a result of these sudden turns although a full analysis studying the details of their appearance in multi - field inflation is beyond the scope of this work and will be addressed in a future report  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it would appear that in generic multi - field models with curved inflationary trajectories , both effects are present and correlated , and can potentially give information about other , much heavier , fields that would otherwise be inaccessible to experiment .",
