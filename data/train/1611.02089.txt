    "this @xmath10-form @xmath11 is called the _ lee form_. these manifolds are a natural generalization of khler manifolds , and they have been much studied by many authors since the work of i. vaisman in the 70s ( see for instance @xcite ) .    a generalization of this class of manifolds is given by the so - called _ locally conformal symplectic _ ( lcs ) manifolds , i.e. , those manifolds carrying a non - degenerate @xmath6-form @xmath5 satisfying @xmath12 for some closed @xmath10-form @xmath11 .",

    "lck and lcs structures on lie groups and lie algebras ( and also in their compact quotients by discrete subgroups , if they exist ) have been considered by several authors lately .",

    "we also determine whether the @xmath0-dimensional lie groups associated to these lie algebras admit lattices ( theorem [ 4-lcs - latt ] ) and finally , we build in each dimension greater than or equal to @xmath23 a family of almost abelian solvmanifolds admitting an lcs structure of the second kind which carry no invariant complex structure .",

    "if the lie group is simply connected , then any left invariant lck or lcs structure turns out to be globally conformal to a khler or symplectic structure .",

    "the codimension one abelian ideal is unique .",
    "an important feature concerning almost abelian lie groups is that there exists a criterion to determine when such a lie group admits lattices . in general , it is not easy to determine if a given lie group @xmath13 admits a lattice .",
