    "recent advances in the observational cosmology make it real to start probing the most intriguing aspects of the universe . in particular , it is of importance to inquire whether the statistical isotropy of the scalar perturbations is exact or only approximate .",
    "this issue is of special interest because the statistical isotropy is one of the key assumptions of the six - parametric @xmath4cdm model and is favored by inflation .",
    "thus , the violation of this property in the observed cmb would imply a highly non - trivial extension of the now standard cosmological model . an additional motivation to search for the statistical anisotropy is the possible presence of various anomalies in the cmb data , such as alignment of low multipoles , axis of evil , power assymetries , cold spots and others  @xcite@xcite .    in the statistically anisotropic but spatially homogeneous universe ,",
    "the power spectrum of the primordial scalar perturbations @xmath5 depends on the direction of the wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "the power spectrum can then be written as follows , @xmath7 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 parametrize the direction - dependent part , which one expands in spherical harmonics @xmath10 . unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume here that the dependence on the wavenumber @xmath11 may be absorbed into one function @xmath12 .",
    "commutativity of the classical field @xmath13 yields @xmath14 and hence @xmath15 for odd @xmath16 .",
    "the generic prediction of the inflationary theory is that the power spectrum is isotropic , @xmath17 .",
    "however , the statistical anisotropy can be generated in models of inflation involving vector fields  @xcite or scalar fields with non - minimal kinetic terms  @xcite ; for reviews see also refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "somewhat more exotic examples are given by introducing bianchi i geometry  @xcite or noncommutative field theory  @xcite .",
    "the most common feature of these models is the statistical anisotropy of a special quadrupole type ( the only non - vanishing coefficient in a certain reference frame on the celestial sphere is @xmath18 ) .",
    "this prediction arises , e.g. , in the model with the rotational invariance broken by a space - like vector  @xcite , or in the hybrid inflation incorporating a vector field coupled to the waterfall scalar  @xcite .",
    "however , higher multipoles @xmath9 can also emerge within the inflationary framework , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in inflationary theory",
    ", the observed approximate flatness of the scalar power spectrum is due to the approximate de  sitter symmetry of inflating space - time .",
    "it has been suggested some time ago  @xcite that , alternatively , the flatness of the power spectrum may be a consequence of conformal symmetry .",
    "concrete models of this sort have been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and further developed in refs .",
    "it is this class of models that we focus on in this paper .    in models of refs .",
    "@xcite and similar ones , it is assumed that the cosmological evolution starts from or passes through a conformally invariant state with effectively flat geometry .",
    "this state is unstable , and conformal symmetry @xmath19 gets broken down to @xmath20 by a time - dependent ( rolling ) scalar field . during this conformal rolling stage , another field of zero conformal weight develops perturbations which automatically have flat power spectrum .",
    "these perturbations are reprocessed into adiabatic perturbations by one or another mechanism ( e.g. , of refs .",
    "@xcite ) at some later epoch , after the end of conformal rolling .",
    "it is then natural that the adiabatic perturbations inherit the properties of the original field perturbations , modulo possible additional non - gaussianity .    at the conformal rolling stage , the properties of perturbations to both linear and leading non - linear orders",
    "are uniquely determined by the underlying conformal symmetry  @xcite , modulo the overall amplitude and a single dimensionless parameter which we call @xmath0 ( in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude is also determined by @xmath0 , see section  [ sec : fields ] ) .",
    "this parameter governs the non - gaussianity and statistical anisotropy .",
    "the statistical anisotropy generated in the conformal rolling scenario is quite different from the predictions of inflation .",
    "in particular , the coefficients @xmath9 parametrizing the power spectrum   are the random variables rather than fixed parameters of the model .",
    "there are two sub - scenarios of the conformal rolling scenario which differ by the behaviour of the cosmologically interesting modes after the end of the conformal rolling stage .",
    "one possibility is that these modes are already superhorizon by the end of conformal rolling and remain frozen until the late hot epoch .",
    "the second sub - scenario assumes that there is an intermediate stage at which the field perturbations evolve in a non - trivial way before crossing out the cosmological horizon and getting finally frozen out . in the latter case , the evolution of the field perturbations results in the statistical anisotropy of all even multipoles .",
    "notably , it does not depend on the magnitude of the momentum @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath12 is independent of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the former sub - scenario for the statistical anisotropy are considerably different . to the linear order in the parameter @xmath21 , one obtains the statistical anisotropy of the general quadrupole type .",
    "it is characterized by the amplitude which decreases with the wavenumber @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "this means that the corresponding effects in the cmb sky are suppressed at high cmb multipoles @xmath23 .",
    "the statistical anisotropy of the special quadrupole type also appears in the next - to - linear order .",
    "though the effect is suppressed by the additional power of the parameter @xmath21 , now the amplitude @xmath12 does not depend on the wavenumber @xmath11",
    "hence , the subleading contribution may make stronger imprint on the cmb .",
    "signatures of the statistical anisotropy in the cmb temperature maps have been searched for in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite . motivated by the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , groeneboom and eriksen  @xcite discovered the evidence for the quadrupole statistical anisotropy in the five - year wmap data .",
    "however , it was found to be nearly aligned with the ecliptic poles . using quadratic maximum likelihood estimator ,",
    "hanson and lewis  @xcite extended the analysis to higher multipoles .",
    "they also included the relevant prefactor in the covariance neglected in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "hanson and lewis  @xcite confirmed the result on the large quadrupole @xmath24 lying nearly in the ecliptic plane .",
    "the strongest indication of the statistical isotropy violation , non - zero at the @xmath25 confidence level , was found in the @xmath2 band of the five - year wmap data in ref .",
    "these findings have been confirmed by the wmap team  @xcite in their analysis of the seven - year data .",
    "one possible explanation of the anomalous quadrupole is the systematics inherent in the wmap data . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , large observed statistical anisotropy may result from beam asymmetries rather than have the cosmological origin .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to constrain the parameter @xmath0 of the conformal rolling scenario from the non - observation of the cosmological statistical anisotropy in the seven - year wmap data .",
    "we follow the general method proposed by hirata and seljak for the purpose of studying cmb lensing and known as the quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimation  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same idea can be applied to the study of the statistically anisotropic properties of cmb . in this case",
    "one assumes that the coefficients @xmath9 are small and expands the log - likelihood of the observed cmb to the second order in these parameters . by maximizing the log - likelihood with respect to the coefficients @xmath9 ,",
    "one obtains the estimator .",
    "results derived within the qml approximation are in a good agreement with the exact likelihood methods .",
    "we apply this method to construct the estimator for the parameter @xmath0 . in view of the results quoted ,",
    "the estimated values are expected to be inconsistent with the statistical isotropy because of the alleged systematics present in the wmap data .",
    "assuming that the interpretation in terms of systematics is correct , we set the upper limits on the parameter @xmath0 in the following way .",
    "for each value of @xmath0 , we simulate the parameter sets @xmath26 , and then generate a number of anisotropic maps for each set @xmath26 . from the maps generated , we estimate the values of the parameter @xmath0 . we require that in 95% cases they should not exceed the value estimated from the observed cmb . in this way we constrain the conformal rolling sub - scenario with the intermediate stage , @xmath27 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the constraint is much weaker in the framework of the alternative sub - scenario .",
    "the reason is that the amplitude of the leading order quadrupole decreases as @xmath28 .",
    "this translates into the suppression of the statistical anisotropy effects at high cmb multipoles .",
    "thus , the data useful for the analysis are effectively limited , statistical errors are large and the constraint is @xmath29 at the 95% confidence level . the constraint is improved significantly , once we take into account the subleading contribution to the statistical anisotropy .",
    "this contribution is of the special quadrupole type , and has the amplitude @xmath12 , which is independent of the wavenumber @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the number of cmb multipoles useful in the analysis is much larger .",
    "this somewhat compensates the smallness of the constant @xmath21 , and we obtain the stronger constraint , @xmath30 at the 95% confidence level . here",
    "@xmath31 is the present value of the hubble parameter , which plays the role of the ultraviolet cutoff , and @xmath4 is the infrared cutoff . without going into speculation on the value of the constant @xmath4 ,",
    "we point out that this constraint is still very weak , in view of the fact that the conformal rolling scenario is self - consistent only at @xmath32 anyway .",
    "we conclude that the statistical anisotropy is the relevant signature of the conformal rolling with the intermediate stage .",
    "it is of particular interest in view of the upcoming planck data .",
    "hopefully , the latter will be free of the quadrupole anomaly .",
    "the other expected advantage of the planck data is the larger range of the cmb multipoles , which translates into smaller statistical errors .",
    "these two factors are expected to improve the sensitivity of the data to the parameter @xmath0 by more than an order of magnitude . on the other hand",
    ", statistical anisotropy appears to be a weak signature of the alternative sub - scenario , and the planck data are not expected to improve the situation significantly .",
    "thus , it makes sense to focus on the other prediction of this sub - scenario , the non - gaussianity  @xcite . at the level of bispectrum , the non - gaussianities in the conformal scenario are not particularly special .",
    "the shape of the intrinsic bispectrum is dictated  @xcite by the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath33 and coincides with the bispectrum of a spectator massless scalar field in inflationary theory  @xcite ( in fact , the intrinsic bispectrum may vanish for symmetry reasons , see section  [ sec : fields ] ) .",
    "the non - gaussianity generated at the conversion epoch is not specific to the conformal scenario either .",
    "so , bispectrum alone can not discriminate between the conformal scenario and , say , inflation equipped with the curvaton mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - gaussianity of a rather peculiar form arises in the trispectrum .",
    "existing constraints ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) are model - dependent and can not be directly applied to our model .",
    "we leave for the future the analysis of the cmb data aiming at the search for the non - gaussianity characteristic of the conformal scenario .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fields ] we review the properties of the field perturbations at the conformal rolling stage .",
    "the power spectrum of relevant perturbations generated by the end of their evolution posseses directional dependence .",
    "we show this explicitly in section  [ statan ] .",
    "we consider two sub - scenarios : one in which the cosmologically interesting modes are superhorizon by the end of the conformal rolling stage ( section  [ sec : scenarioa ] ) and another , with long intermediate stage ( section  [ sec : scenariob ] ) . in section  [ sec : estimator ] we review the main ideas of the qml method and construct model - independent estimators for the coefficients @xmath9 .",
    "we also construct an estimator for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] contains our main results .",
    "we implement the estimators to the seven - year wmap data and constrain the parameter @xmath0 of the two sub - scenarios .",
    "the main ingredient of the conformal rolling scenario  @xcite is the conformal stage preceding the conventional hot epoch .",
    "as we point out below , the properties of the conformal rolling stage are quite general  @xcite , as they are unambiguously determined by conformal symmetry .",
    "yet it is instructive to review a simple explicit model  @xcite illustrating this scenario .",
    "it involves a complex scalar field @xmath34 , conformally coupled to gravity , which rolls down the negative quartic potential @xmath35 , where @xmath21 is a small parameter . at large field values",
    ", the potential is assumed to change and have a minimum at @xmath36 where conformal symmetry is explicitly broken . the field @xmath34 is a spectator at the conformal rolling stage and somewhat later , i.e. , the evolution of the universe is dominated by some other matter ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative version where @xmath34 is the dominant matter component ) .",
    "the central object in the model is the phase @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 .",
    "its perturbations @xmath39 start off as vacuum fluctuations and eventually freeze out . by the end of conformal rolling , perturbations @xmath39 have flat power spectrum .",
    "once the radial field @xmath40 settles down to @xmath41 and conformal symmetry gets broken , what remains are the perturbations of the phase , which at this point are isocurvature perturbations .",
    "they get reprocessed into adiabatic perturbations at much later epoch . in this way the flat power spectrum of the adiabatic perturbations is obtained .",
    "it can be slightly tilted if there is small explicit breaking of conformal symmetry at the conformal rolling stage  @xcite .",
    "let us discuss conformal rolling in more detail . at this stage ,",

    "since the scalar potential is negative , the conformally invariant state @xmath50 is unstable , and the field rolls down its potential .",

    ". these are the phase perturbations by the end of conformal rolling .",
    "as promised , they do not depend on the conformal time @xmath49 , @xmath92 to the leading order in @xmath21 , the parameter @xmath93 is independent of @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 , @xmath96 and the phase perturbations are gaussian random field with the flat power spectrum and amplitude of order @xmath21 . to the subleading order ,",
    "the expression involves another time - independent gaussian field @xmath97 .",
    "this leads to both non - gaussianity and statistical anisotropy of @xmath98 and hence @xmath99 .",
    "note that the symmetry @xmath100 ensures that the intrinsic bispectrum vanishes in the concrete model we review .",
    "an important remark is in order . even though we illustrated the conformal rolling mechanism by making use of the concrete model , the results are characteristic of the entire class of conformal models . as an example , the above formulas are valid  @xcite , modulo field redefinition , in the galilean genesis model  @xcite based on conformal galileon field with higher derivative action  @xcite .",
    "in fact , these formulas hold  @xcite , provided that the theory has the following general properties at the conformal rolling stage : ( i ) space - time is effectively minkowskian ; ( ii ) conformal symmetry @xmath19 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath20 by a homogeneously rolling scalar field of non - zero conformal weight ( @xmath101 in the above example ) ; ( iii ) there is another scalar field of zero conformal weight ( the phase field @xmath37 above ) whose perturbations are in the end converted into the adiabatic perturbations .",
    "the only qualification is that the latter field need not be compact , so the amplitude of its canonically normalized perturbations can be arbitrary , whereas the overall amplitude of @xmath39 in the model is proportional to the same parameter @xmath21 that determines the amplitude of the perturbations @xmath97 and hence non - linear terms in @xmath39 , see eqs .   and .",
    "to avoid confusion , we note that the model ( [ feb15 - 2 ] ) is different from the galilean genesis model  @xcite and the pseudo - conformal model of ref .",
    "@xcite in that in the latter models , the cosmological background itself is driven by the rolling scalar field ( @xmath101 in our notations ) .",
    "therefore , the perturbation of this field ( mode @xmath56 ) is gauge - dependent , while the cuvature perturbation @xmath102 has blue power spectrum .",
    "this , however , does not invalidate the discussion in the previous paragraph .",
    "indeed , the time shift ( analogous to our @xmath97 ) can be given a gauge - invariant definition  @xcite ; this field is related to , but different from @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , at early times , when the conformal mechanism operates in models of refs .",
    "@xcite , the energy density and pressure of the rolling field are small , so the effects due to gravity are negligible .",
    "this is particularly clear in the newtonian gauge  @xcite , where the metric perturbations are small at early times , while the perturbations in the rolling field have the form equivalent to eq .  .",
    "in this regime , the curvature perturbation @xmath102 is irrelevant , as long as one is interested in the perturbations of the field similar to our phase @xmath37 , and the formulas of this section remain valid .",
    "this has been shown expicitly  @xcite in the pseudo - conformal model of ref .",
    "@xcite , both in the newtonian gauge and in the gauge @xmath103 .",
    "we continue to use the terminology borrowed from the model .    at the conformal rolling stage ,",
    "the phase perturbations @xmath39 get frozen out because of the fast evolving background .",
    "once the conformal rolling stage ends and the radial field settles down to a constant value @xmath41 , the phase becomes a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the behavior of its perturbations at later times depends on whether they are super- or subhorizon in the conventional sense by the end of conformal rolling .",
    "accordingly , there are two sub - scenarios which give different predictions for the statistical anisotropy ( and non - gaussinaity as well )  @xcite .      in this sub - scenario",
    ", the phase perturbations are already superhorizon by the end of conformal rolling .",
    "so , they remain frozen out , and there is a simple relation between the adiabatic and phase perturbations , @xmath104 plus possible non - linear terms , where @xmath98 are the phase perturbations late at the conformal rolling stage .",
    "so , the properties of @xmath102 can be read off from eq .  ,",
    "modulo possible non - gaussianity generated when @xmath39 is converted into @xmath102 .",
    "the interaction of the phase perturbations with the radial ones at the conformal rolling stage leads to non - trivial effects in the spectrum of the primordial perturbations .",
    "in particular , it gives rise to the statistical anisotropy .",
    "indeed , let us consider the two - point product @xmath105 and average it over the realizations of the operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 . to the leading order",
    ", we obtain the flat and isotropic power spectrum .",

    "the field @xmath68 gets averaged out .",
    "therefore , the expression in parenthesis in should be treated as a constant tensor throughout our part of the universe ; retaining its dependence on @xmath94 would result in effects suppressed by @xmath118 .",

    "the amplitude @xmath12 is independent of the wavenumber @xmath11 .",
    "we will see that this fact is crucial from the viewpoint of the cmb observations .",
    "the other important distinction is that the quantities @xmath24 are not gaussian now .",

    "@xcite@xcite , the preferred quadrupole direction lies very close to the ecliptic poles .",
    "another suspicious thing is the frequency dependence of the signal .",
    "namely , it is non - zero in the @xmath2 band at much higher confidence level than in the @xmath1 band .",
    "this indicates a systematic effect rather than the cosmological origin . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the account of beam asymmetries can provide a complete explanation of the anomaly .",
    "let us turn to the conformal rolling scenario .",
    "first , we consider the version of the model with the intermediate stage ( sub - scenario b ) .",
    "the statistical anisotropy is determined by eqs .   and .",
    "having the set of the coefficients @xmath231 reconstructed from the observed cmb , we solve eq .   and",
    "estimate the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we perform the analysis for the multipole numbers starting from @xmath232 and ranging up to @xmath233 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ h2 ] . to evaluate the statistical errors we use about one hundred mc simulated isotropic maps .",
    "we see that the isotropic model is ruled out at more than @xmath234 confidence level even in the @xmath1 band .",
    "however , the large value of @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xmath235 at @xmath236 ) is due to the anomalous quadrupole anisotropy , which is argued to have non - cosmological origin .    aiming at constraining the parameter @xmath0 , we simulate a large number of anisotropic maps for each value of this parameter .",
    "we adapt the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , and use the following procedure , adequate in the case of small statistical anisotropy .",
    "we first simulate a seed map @xmath237 with a covariance @xmath153  given by eq .  .",
    "then we generate a set of coefficients @xmath238 based on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the map @xmath239^{-1 } \\right)^{1/2 } { \\bf \\theta}^i \\ ; , \\ ] ] has covariance @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is given by eq .  . to the linear order in the anisotropic effects we have @xmath242^{-1 } { \\bf \\theta}^{i } \\",
    "; .\\ ] ] finally , we multiply the map by the beam transfer function in the harmonic space , convert it to coordinate space and add pixel noise to get statistically anisotropic simulated map @xmath243 similar to that observed by wmap . to set an upper limit , we allow @xmath0 to be so large that for @xmath244 of simulated anisotropic maps",
    "the value of the estimated parameter exceeds the value estimated from the observed cmb map . in this way",
    "we obtain the upper limit , which reads @xmath245 at the 95% confidence level .    in view of the likely non - cosmological origin of the anomalous quadrupole in the statistical anisotropy of the wmap data",
    ", one would like to constrain the parameter @xmath0 from the non - observation of higher multipoles only .",
    "one way to do that would be to follow the same procedure as discussed in section  [ sec : parameter ] but keep the set @xmath246 of the quadrupole coefficients fixed and taken from the observational data . in practice , things are simpler . indeed",
    ", the effects of the statistical anisotropy corresponding to different multipole numbers @xmath16 , @xmath177 do not interfere with each other , at least in the approximation of small coefficients @xmath9 . to see this , we note that the theoretical reconstruction of the fisher matrix   is diagonal .",
    "the covariances of the quantities @xmath9 are diagonal as well . as a consequence , it is straightforward to neglect the effect of the quadrupole modulation by using the estimator for the parameter @xmath0 as in   but with the summation starting from @xmath247 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 estimated in this way are plotted in fig .",
    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath236 and obtain that @xmath0 is consistent with zero for the v band . making use of the statistical uncertainty inferred from isotropic mc maps , we obtain the upper limit @xmath248 at the @xmath244 confidence level . even though omitting the anomalous quadrupole makes the situation cleaner ( at least in the @xmath1 band ) , this constraint is similar to eq .  .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , according to eq .",
    ", the predicted statistical anisotropy spectrum @xmath231 decreases with @xmath16 as @xmath249 second , the errors grow with the multipole number roughly as @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ cl ] .    with the planck data available , we expect substantial improvement of the constraint  .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "hopefully , the quadrupole anomaly will be absent in the planck data . also , the range of the cmb multipoles useful in the analysis will be considerably extended .",
    "the error bars , whch can be roughly estimated by making use of the inverse fisher matrix , scale with the number of multipoles as @xmath250 .",
    "this is clear from the eq .  .",
    "taking , e.g. , @xmath251 , one would be able to reduce the error bars by about an order of magnitude .",
    "hence , the non - observation of the statistical anisotropy will give the constraint as strong as @xmath252 .",
    "we conclude that the statistical anisotropy is a promising signature from the viewpoint of the cmb observations in the case of the sub - scenario b.    finally , we consider the sub - scenario a. to the linear order in constant @xmath21 , the statistical anisotropy is of the general quadrupole type with decreasing amplitude , @xmath22 . this fact is crucial for the search for the statistical anisotropy in the cmb sky .",
    "indeed , the contribution to the signal @xmath154 is additionally suppressed by the cmb multipole number @xmath23 .",
    "this suppression is due to the fact that the integral in eq .",
    "is saturated , roughly speaking , at @xmath253 .",
    "effectively , it results in low statistics of the relevant cmb multipoles and large statistical errors , which severely restrict the opportunity to observe the ( cosmological ) statistical anisotropy of the type predicted .",
    "somewhat loosely we apply the qml estimator to the seven - year wmap data . in fig .",
    "[ k1 ] we show the results for @xmath197 of the wmap reconstructed coefficients @xmath9 , assuming @xmath254 , but not restricting yet to the quadrupole - only @xmath9 .",
    "we apply the procedure used in the case of the sub - scenario with the intermediate stage , to constrain the sub - scenario a ; to this end , the quadrupole point @xmath255 in fig .",
    "[ k1 ] is relevant only .",
    "the limit on the parameter @xmath0 then reads @xmath256 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "note , however , that for large values of @xmath0 , the qml procedure is questionable .",
    "this limit can be viewed merely as an indication that the leading order contribution to the statistical anisotropy is in fact negligible .",
    "the stronger constraint comes from the subleading contribution encoded in  .",
    "the reason is that the amplitude @xmath12 is independent of the wavenumber @xmath11 in this case .",
    "thus , the suppression at high cmb multipoles is absent , and the range of relevant @xmath23 s is extended up to @xmath228 . since the quantities @xmath24 are non - gaussian in this particular case , the constraining procedure is somewhat different .",
    "first , we generate the components of the `` velocity '' @xmath84 starting from a given value of the effective constant @xmath203 .",
    "then , using  , we calculate the coefficients @xmath24 .",
    "the quantity @xmath257 constructed out of these @xmath24 is compared with the one estimated from the seven - year wmap data . in this way we obtain the constraint , which reads @xmath258 at the 95% confidence level . assuming that the logarithmic enhancement is not particularly strong , we conclude that this constraint is still weak .",
    "note also that the statistical anisotropy predicted by the sub - scenario  a is of the same type as in some inflationary models  @xcite    @xcite .",
    "thus , it can not be used to descriminate our model from other models of the generation of primordial perturbations .",
    "fortunately , the sub - scenario  a gives rise to the non - gaussianity in the trispectrum  @xcite , which is in the sharp contrast with the inflationary predictions .",
    "we leave for the future search for the corresponding signatures in the cmb sky .",

    "<S> we confirm the large quadrupole anisotropy detected in @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands , which has been argued to originate from systematic effects rather than from cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we construct an estimator for the parameter @xmath0 . in the case of the sub - scenario with the intermediate stage we set an upper limit @xmath3 at the 95% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> the constraint on @xmath0 is much weaker in the case of another sub - scenario , where the intermediate stage is absent . </S>"
