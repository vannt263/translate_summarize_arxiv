    "at present it is not known whether there exist sterile neutrinos .",
    "if they do , there exist additional neutrino mass eigenstates , and two of the central questions are : ( 1 ) how heavy are the new mass eigenstates @xmath2 ? ( 2 ) how strong ( weak ) are the corresponding heavy - light mixings @xmath9 , i.e. , mixings of @xmath2 with the standard model ( sm ) flavor neutrinos @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ?",
    "further , it is not known whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac fermions .",
    "majorana fermions are at the same time their own antiparticles , which is not the case for dirac fermions such as charged leptons or quarks .",
    "majorana neutrinos allow both lepton number conserving ( lnc ) and lepton number violating ( lnv ) processes , while dirac neutrinos allow only lnc processes to take place .",

    "the existence of sterile ( usually majorana ) neutrinos can be established by specific scattering processes @xcite and via rare meson decays @xcite .",
    "evidence of the nonzero neutrino masses comes from neutrino oscillation , predicted by @xcite and later observed @xcite .",
    "the observation of oscillations can determine the mass differences of the light neutrinos .",
    "nonetheless , if several sterile neutrinos exist , they may result in almost degenerate heavy mass states and such scenarios can lead to oscillation of heavy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos and the corresponding heavy neutrino particles appear naturally in several scenarios in which the small masses of the light neutrinos are explained . the very low masses @xmath13 ev of the three light neutrinos can be explained by seesaw scenarios @xcite where neutrinos are majorana particles and the heavy neutrino mass eigenstates have very high masses @xmath14 tev .",
    "other seesaw scenarios have lower masses of the heavy neutrinos , @xmath15 tev @xcite and @xmath15 gev @xcite , and their mixing with the sm flavors is in general less suppressed than in the original seesaw scenarios .",
    "cp violation is also possible in the neutrino sector @xcite . in the heavy neutrino sector",
    ", cp violation has been investigated in scattering processes @xcite ( resonant cp violation ) , coming from interference of the tree - level and one - loop neutrino propagator effects .",
    "resonant cp violation was also investigated in the leptonic @xcite and semileptonic rare meson decays @xcite , using a simplified ( effectively tree - level ) approach .",
    "these effects are appreciable in scenarios where we have at least two heavy almost degenerate neutrinos ( as is also required for oscillation , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , with masses @xmath16 gev .",
    "such scenarios appear to be compatible with the neutrino minimal standard model ( @xmath17msm ) @xcite and some low - scale seesaw models @xcite .    in this work",

    "@xcite we investigated semihadronic rare decays of charged pseudoscalar mesons in such scenarios , with intermediate on - shell neutrino @xmath2 and final pseudoscalar meson , such as @xmath20 .",
    "cp violation in such type of decays ( with two intermediate almost degenerated neutrinos @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) were investigated in refs .",

    "such decays have lnv and lnc channels , and the intermediate neutrino(s ) @xmath2 can be either majorana or dirac . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "also a review @xcite ) we showed that it is possible to distinguish between the majorana and dirac nature of @xmath2 in such decays by measuring the differential decay width @xmath25 with respect of the muon energy @xmath26 ( the latter being in the @xmath2-rest frame ) . since the heavy - light neutrino mixing coefficients",
    "are expected to be very suppressed , such differential decay width is difficult to measure with sufficient statistics . nonetheless , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , this problem can be overcome if the decaying pions are produced copiously ( project x , @xmath27 pions per year , @xcite ) . on the other hand , since pions are light , the produced on - shell neutrinos @xmath2 are also light and have thus a long lifetime , thus most of them escape through the detector before decaying .",
    "this effect accounts for a significant suppression of the decay rate in the mentioned rare decays @xmath23 .",
    "recently this issue of differentiating between majorana and dirac sterile neutrinos at the lhc has been revisited @xcite for the mass of sterile neutrino @xmath28 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the analogous rare leptonic decays of heavier mesons , such as @xmath0 or @xmath8 , the masses of the intermediate on - shell neutrinos can be significantly larger , and the decay widths of the rare decays are larger .",
    "nonetheless , such mesons are not produced copiously , except at lhc - b and in an upgrade of the belle experiment , belle ii @xcite .",
    "it is expected that belle ii can produce @xmath1 @xmath0-pairs per year .",
    "therefore , rare decays of @xmath0 mesons may give us a hint of the existence of heavier sterile neutrinos with masses of up to @xmath29 gev . moreover , differential decay widths of such decays may offer us a possibility of discerning the nature ( majorana or dirac ) of such neutrinos .",
    "however , the rare leptonic decays of the type @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are light charged leptons and @xmath17 is a light neutrino , are strongly ckm - suppressed in comparison with the analogous decays of @xmath8 mesons ( because @xmath32 ) .",
    "belle ii will produce @xmath0 mesons but not @xmath8 mesons .",
    "therefore , rare leptonic decays can not play an important role at belle ii , but rather at lhc - b where @xmath8 mesons are produced copiously .",
    "the question that arises naturally , especially for belle - ii measurements , is whether we can have rare @xmath0-meson decays which are not ckm - suppressed .",
    "the answer to this question is affirmative : namely , semihadronic rare @xmath0-meson decays @xmath33 and consecutively @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) are not ckm - suppressed because they are proportional to @xmath36 .    in this work",
