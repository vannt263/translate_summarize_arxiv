    "[ fig : tin ] , we show the time required by a pah to absorb one destructive photon , t@xmath174 , as a function of pah size @xmath154 ( filled - dots line ) , along with the average time for a pah to get hit by a photon of any energy ( triangle - symbols line ) .",
    "we use our sn burst templates described in sec .",
    "[ sec : snbursts ] and assume the distance of 199 light years ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] ) from cas a to the echo region . under those assumptions",

    "[ sec : snbursts ] shining on the dust particles .     in the pah .",
    "the triangle - symbols line shows the time required to get hit by a photon of any energy , including those not able to rip off atoms of the pah structure . ]",
    "we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : tin ] a higher - end estimate of the time required for a pahs of a certain size to be destroyed via photodissociation ( empty - dots line ) , based on the conservative following approach : assuming an initial pah size @xmath175 , we find the mean time required to get hit by a destructive photon ( eq .  [ eq : tin ] ) , calculate the number @xmath92 of atoms kicked off ( via eq .",
    "[ eq : x ] ) given the destructive photon mean energy ( from eq.[eq : numean ] ) .",
    "we then start again with the new , smaller , pah with @xmath176 atoms , and iterate the process until we reach @xmath177 , a value below which the pahs are photolitically unstable @xcite .",
    "summing the time of the various steps of the loop gives us the mean destruction time @xmath178 for a pah of size @xmath175 .",
    "this time can be considered as an over estimate , as a pah , after having lost some atoms , might not turn into a stable pahs of the new size .",
    "the c - atoms will likely be ripped off at random position , and thus weaken the pah structure . in that sense , it may be possible that less impacts of destroying photons are required in order to achieve the destruction of the pah - this , however , is not certain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tin ] , the destruction time increases rapidly with the pah size , and it already takes @xmath12.5 days in order to destroy pahs with an initial size of @xmath1300 c - atoms .",
    "let us recall here that assuming all pahs below 80 carbon atoms and 50% of pahs from 80 to 300 carbon atoms to be destroyed lead to the sim2 simulation .",
    "these very similar values suggest , under the assumptions of this simple pah destruction model , that the destruction of pahs by the uv burst appears plausible and logical .",
    "it should be noted here that we have neglected any dust processing mechanisms other than photodissociation , such as recombination , hydrogenation or the coagulation of small molecules on bigger ones @xcite .",
    "we do not expect these to have an impact as important as photodissociation in shaping the echo spectrum , as the reaction timescale are expected to be significantly larger than the duration of the uv - burst , typically of the order of a few years for hydrogenation and recombination ( in a standard ism environment , see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a dust destruction scenario also appears of special interest when considering the fact that @xcite have found strong [ c  i]@xmath109850   carbon emission in their optical spectrum of an echo region around cas a. the [ c  i ] lines can be excited via two main mechanisms : radiative recombination and collisional excitation by electrons .",
    "@xcite suggested the first mechanism to explain the [ c  i ] emission lines from m  42 and ngc  2024 , requiring strong radiation ( 10@xmath179 to 10@xmath180 times the isrf ) heating gas with a density of 10@xmath181  h  @xmath2 ; a radiation field intensity not so different from the one considered in this work . in our dust model , the c / h ratio in pahs is 16.1  ppm for n@xmath182100 , 26.1  ppm for n@xmath182200 and 36.1  ppm for n@xmath182500 ( see table  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "dust destruction in the form of @xmath115 described in eq .",
    "[ eq : xi ] will therefore , if affected pahs are entirely disrupted , increase the ism gas phase abundance of c atoms by @xmath124  ppm .",
    "standard carbon abundances in the gas phase of low to moderate density ism have been measured to be of the order of 150 ppm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xcite found abundances of the order of 50 - 100  ppm in the cold neutral medium .",
    "recently , using a different estimation method based on the strong transition of cii  @xmath101334   , @xcite suggested that the carbon gas phase abundance might be lower by @xmath140% than previous values found using methods based on a weak intersystem absorption transition . in any case , our dust destruction scenario could increase the amount of c atoms in the gas phase by as much as 10%-20% , which could in turn potentially affect the [ c  i ] line by the same factor .",
    "if this suggest that the [ c  i]]@xmath109850   detected by @xcite is not an unambiguous and direct confirmation of our scenario of pahs destruction , it can not be ruled out that destroyed pahs influence its strength .",
    "clearly , the study of other optical light echoes is required to better understand the origin and the ubiquity ( or not ) of the [ c  i]@xmath109850   line .",
    "we have obtained a spitzer irs spectrum and mips photometric measurements of an ir echo region around the cas a supernova . using simulations of an ism dust mix containing both carbon and silicate quantum - heated and thermal grain as well as pahs ,",
    "we can , to a large extent , reproduce the recorded ir echo spectrum . specifically :    1 .",
    "we find that the infrared echo spectrum can be described as the thermal signature from an uv and an optical component .",
    "those uv and optical component characteristics correspond to the values of the type iib sn 1993j which is considered to be representative of the cas a supernova based on its optical spectrum .",
    "their respective contribution in our best fit to the echo total luminosity are @xmath183% and @xmath117% ( in the 5 - 38 @xmath0 m range ) .",
    "2 .   the influence of the optically - heated dust becomes more important than uv - heated dust above @xmath150@xmath0 m .",
    "especially , the presence of the optical component in our heating spectrum is consistent with the 70@xmath0 m photometric measurement of the recorded echo .",
    "the spectrum below 15  @xmath0 m is better reproduced when removing artificially small pahs with less than 80 carbon atoms , and by removing 50% of pahs with 80 to 300 carbon atoms .",
    "the especially weak 11@xmath0 m complex of pah features in the recorded echo spectrum can be reproduced when introducing 80% of dehydrogenation for all pahs in our simulation .",
    "our best fit simulation implies a lower limit for the density of this echo region of @xmath183679  h  @xmath2 .",
    "the removal of small pahs is consistent with a simple and rather conservative theoretical model of pahs destruction via photodissociation assuming the considered uv burst radiation field .",
    "the strong dehydrogenation ratio of pahs , as compared to the amount of pahs destruction , is also consistent with this picture , where pahs tend to loose hydrogen atoms first . in the future , a more careful modelling of pahs destruction and dehydrogenation as compared to the one adopted here could lead to an even better fit to the recorded ir echo spectrum .",
    "the relatively weak 5 - 9  @xmath0 m pah complex , where our simulations differ from the recorded echo spectrum by a factor of @xmath1250% , remains to be explained .",
    "the approach we adopted in this work , in order to study dust processing in the ism , has a great potential .",
    "our results aim at being tested towards other echo regions around cas a and other snr , and this preliminary study shows the wealth of potential outcomes .",
    "the unique nature of ir echoes enables the study of otherwise cold and very faint ism structures being strongly processed over a very short period of time .",
    "such ism clouds , potentially being initially pristine , undisturbed , and located away from any altering radiation sources , can provide unique insights in the ism physics .",
    "furthermore , the large amount of echoes provides us with an extensive number of locations and environments to test the simulations and conclusions presented in this article .",
    "it is currently rather difficult to obtain near ir spectra of echoing regions , now that the spitzer space telescope has reached the end of its duty cycle .",
    "fortunately , there are some exciting prospects for observations at those wavelengths , such as the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) @xcite or the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _",
    "( sofia ) @xcite which has seen its first light in may 2010 .",
    "these telescopes and their instruments will be ideally suited to record infrared spectra of echoing regions , and we expect that infrared echoes will provide many new and unique insights into the ism dust composition and chemistry , as well as into the sn symmetries and characterization .",
