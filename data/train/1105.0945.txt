    "this paper uses quantum information measures , such as entanglement , and trace distance to study quantum many body systems . unlike physical observables , such quantities usually can not be directly measured @xcite , but can give an important insite into the properties of the system .",
    "abstract concepts such as quantum entanglement have been important for almost as long as quantum mechanics has existed @xcite .",
    "the power of these information theoretical quantities is that they represent general ideas that can be applied to any system which can be considered quantum .",
    "by studying such abstract quantities one can more easily generalize a result for a specific system to more universal behavior .",
    "examples of successful application of quantum information measures to the study of quantum many body systems are many , a few examples are @xcite",
    ". the specific uses of these quantities can be diverse , for example in @xcite the authors use the concept of trace distance from an averaged density matrix to define a type of quantum equilibration which would be analogous to equilibration in classical thermodynamics .",
    "similar questions are examined , but with different methods , in @xcite , where the concept of equilibration is used to detect criticality in a system . in @xcite a quantity related to fidelity is used to detect quantum chaos .",
    "this paper will make broad use of such quantum informational quantities , but will deal with relatively few direct observables .",
    "this is because our intention is to provide a study which can be easily related to other quantum systems , and to quantum many body theory in general .",
    "the central result of this paper involves a type of local quench which can propagate disturbances an unlimited distance in a j1-j2 heisenberg spin chain .",
    "the unitary dynamics of spin chains which can be studied through quenches can be realized experimentally with trapped cold atoms @xcite .",
    "certain superconducting qubit arrays can also provide promising physical realizations of spin chain hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "quenches are also important from a theoretical perspective . for example",
    ", quantum equilibration can be induced and studied in spin chains using various quenches @xcite .",
    "certain local quenches have also been proposed as a way to physically measure entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "furthermore local magnetic field quenches similar to those studied in this paper have been used to study entanglement specifically in heisenberg spin chains@xcite , as well as other quantum systems @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the specific system which is studied in this paper has also been proposed as being possibly useful in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the frustrated spin-1/2 anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg chain has one of the most prototypical matrix product ground states , featuring a two - fold degeneracy at the so - called majumdar - ghosh point @xcite , when the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor exchange integrals are the same .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is given by    @xmath0    where the sum extends over @xmath1 lattice sites , and the two terms represent anti - ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor heisenberg interactions respectively .",
    "the ground state of this model is exactly known @xcite , @xmath2 i.e. the product of nearest - neighbor spin singlets , assuming an even number of lattice sites . for the case of open boundary conditions , this state is unique , whereas for periodic boundary conditions it is two - fold degenerate , as the underlying lattice can be decorated by the singlet product state in another unique way , @xmath3 the resulting ground state for the periodic system is a superposition , @xmath4 where the two terms are not automatically orthogonal .",
    "@xcite hence , changing the boundary conditions of the hamiltonian from open to periodic one goes from a unique to a two - fold degenerate ground state , thus allowing us to study the effects of a ground state degeneracy .",
    "local disturbances of this ground state can be introduced by applying a local magnetic field @xmath5 to a subset of @xmath6 adjacent spins , @xmath7 where without loss of generality we consider the direction of the applied field to be along the z - direction .",
    "one can take advantage of the fact that spin polarization is conserved in this system , allowing one to reduce the complexity of the problem by dividing the hamiltonian into independent spin sectors , which may each be diagonalized independently .",
    "these sectors correspond to the total polarization of the system in the z direction , and may be diagonalized independently .",
    "the polarization sector which contains the global ground state of the system changes with field strength , therefore figures [ fig : sd_&_l_vs_h ] , [ fig : sd_&_l_vs_h],[fig : open sdvsem],[fig : periodic sdvem ] , [ fig : singlet shift ] , and [ fig : initial dist to av ] all show curves for three different polarization sectors .",
    "each sector is labeled with the total z polarization of the entire spin chain in that sector , which is conserved under the action of all hamiltonians considered in this paper .",
    "for example in the basis where @xmath8 is diagonal , all of the basis states in the l=0 sector will have the same number of spins pointing in + z as -z , in the l=-1 state , 2 more spins will be facing in -z than + z , etc .",
    "[ fig : quench ]    in this study , we identify several effects induced by the application of a local magnetic field , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench ] . here",
    "we briefly summarize our findings .",
    "firstly , for sufficiently small field amplitudes polarization induced by the local magnetic field is stored in the vicinity of the region to which the field is applied , instead of spreading throughout the entire system . only beyond a certain threshold field ,",
    "i.e. once some of the polarization in this boundary region has saturated , can it spread throughout the entire system .",
    "we argue that this is to be expected because at the majumdar - ghosh point the energy spectrum of the j1-j2 heisenberg hamiltonian is gapped .",
    "provided that the energy gained from the locally applied magnetic field is small compared to the coupling energy of the spins , any state which keeps the majority of spins in a matrix product configuration similar to the zero field ground state will have a lower energy . for an even number of spins in the non - field region , the system can only accomplish this if the total polarization of a given subsystem far from the field region is zero .",
    "the spins in the field region align in the direction of the applied field , thus in turn leading to an excess opposite polarization of the spins not directly subjected to the field .",
    "this induced polarization is typically localized near the edge of the field region .",
    "we will show , however , that this effect does not occur if the two degenerate ground states lie in different polarization sectors , because in this case the polarization can spread through the degenerate subspace at no energy penalty .",
    "we will also show that , for a sufficiently small fraction of the spins subjected to the field , there exists at least one state in one of the polarization sectors which looks locally like the zero field ( mps ) ground state far from the field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundry cartoon ] ) . for the systems studied in this paper one of these states is always the ground state .",
    "@xcite        for the case of periodic boundary conditions , any state which lies locally in the degenerate subspace far from the local magnetic field region will have the minimum local contribution to the energy .",
    "this means that even for a system with many more spins outside of the field than within it , a disturbance can easily propagate throughout the entire zero field region .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the observables on which we focus to understand the effects of a local applied magnetic field on this many - body system .",
    "the cases of open and periodic boundary conditions need to be treated separately . in section 3",
    ", we then discuss the physics of open chains , and in section 4 the phenomena observed in periodic systems .",
    "in section 5 , we consider how these results are affected when one departs from the majumdar - ghosh point in the underlying hamiltonian .",
    "this is followed by conclusions in section 6 .",
    "for open boundary conditions the field is applied to n spins on one end of the chain .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we consider finite chains with a total number of spins , n , performing full numerical diagonalizations of the frustrated majumdar - ghosh heisenberg hamiltonian.@xcite several observables are studied .",
    "the first is the total polarization outside of the region subjected to the applied field .",
    "while the total spin polarization of the chain is conserved , local polarization is not .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath9    furthermore , we study the trace distance from a singlet state of the two spins at the end of the chain opposite to the region of the applied magnetic field , i.e. the spins located at sites @xmath10 and @xmath1 .",
    "this observable is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12    finally , we focus on the polarization of the spins at sites @xmath10 and @xmath1 , defined the same as in eq .",
    "[ eq : l not n ] , but with the sum running from n-1 to n. in this paper the subsystem of the 2 furthest spins will be labeled f. this observable tells about whether the polarization has been allowed to spread to the furthest 2 spins from the field .",
    "two different sizes of field regions are considered , n=5 and n=4 .",
    "the reason that both are considered separately is that there are significant even - odd effects .    in this paper ,",
    "no actual quenches are performed in the system with open boundary conditions , and all observables are given for the ground state of a given sector .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions , the field is applied to a region of n adjacent spins . in this case",
    ", we are considering chains with an even number of sites . while the observables studied in the periodic case",
    "are defined in analogy to those studied in the open case , some extra care is necessary . in particular ,",
    "a complication arises for the trace distance from a singlet for the two spins furthest from the field region . for periodic boundary conditions",
    ", there is no unique choice of singlet covering for the system .",
    "two different approaches to this problem are examined .",
    "firstly , one can consider the distance from the closest of the two singlet coverings for a subsystem , @xmath13 however , this quantity has a drawback , i.e. all but a zero measure set of states in the degenerate subspace will have a finite distance to either of these coverings .",
    "an alternative approach is to look at the distance from the closest point in the subspace to the reduced density matrix , @xmath14\\vert_{1}).\\label{eq : dist sing subspace}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation appears as though it can be further simplified in an obvious way , but remember that the two wave functions are not orthogonal . the norm in the denominator is the usual l2 norm for a vector .",
    "also in this case the minimization is actually simpler than it looks , by realizing that it can be reduced to : @xmath15 where @xmath16is the 4-dimensional identity operator .",
    "while the observables presented in this section could be considered as time dependent variables , in this paper they are always studied for the ground state of a given polarization sector .",
    "because of the degeneracy caused by the periodic boundaries there is another quantity which is interesting to look at , relating to a field quench performed by changing the magnetic field instantaneously and subsequently monitoring the time evolution of the system , especially in regions far from where the local field is applied .",
    "unitary evolution gives the time evolution of a system following a quench at time @xmath17 , in terms of energies @xmath18 , @xmath19\\quad,\\label{eq : time evolution}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , where @xmath21is the pre - quench ground state of the system .",
    "this leads to a definition of the time averaged state , @xmath22    the field quench is performed by taking @xmath23 to be the ground state of a hamiltonian with a slightly stronger field , @xmath24 . at @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath25 is instantaneously turned off . in our analysis of the time evolution , we will focus on the trace distance from the time averaged ( or dephased ) state of the density matrix of the two spins furthest away from the field region @xmath26      we also examine the time evolution due to large local field quenches .",
    "several statistical distributions are studied to understand the ensuing equilibration behavior .",
    "these quenches are performed in a regime where quenches are shown to disturb the entire system , even regions far away from the field region . a global quantity which is studied",
    "is the loschmidt echo , a measure of the overlap of the time evolved system with the initial state , @xmath27    two local linear quantities are examined as well . in the region",
    "subjected to the local external field , the local polarization is studied .",
    "this is simply the expectation value of the magnetization operator with respect to the local density matrix , @xmath28    in the region far from the spins where the local magnetic field is applied , all of the states are expected to be locally within the degenerate ground state subspace and therefore have zero magnetization .",
    "therefore , a more appropriate observable to use is the overlap with a singlet state , @xmath29    finally an important non - linear local quantity is studied far from the local magnetic field , the time evolving distance to the average state , defined by @xmath30 this quantity is important , as it provides a direct measure of equilibration locally , and can thus be used to show that the quench not only disturbs the system far from the field , but also that these disturbances can cause equilibration .",
    "a tool which is used in this paper for visualizing quantum states is a map of two point entanglement . in these graphics ,",
    "colors are used to indicate entanglement strength between single spins using von neumann entropy , @xmath31 as a measure of entanglement .",
    "these graphics consist of arrays of colored squares where , for off - diagonal elements , the color corresponds to the entanglement between the two spins .",
    "the diagonal elements correspond to the difference between the maximum possible entropy on a spin and the actual entropy .",
    "this represents the the amount of information left about a spin after the rest of the system is measured .",
    "these maps are created using @xmath32    the color scale with the maximum entanglement normalized to 1 appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : entmap l1 h5 s4 ] .",
    "it is important to note that while these figures can give a good general impression of entanglement behavior of the system , they do not tell the whole story , i.e. they only give information about two - point entanglement .",
    "just because one of these figures shows no two point entanglement for a pair of spins , this does not mean that they are not entangled in a more complicated way.@xcite    although in principle there is nothing preventing one from obtaining entanglement maps for time averaged states , in this paper we only use this technique to study eigenstates .",
    "subjecting a local region of a majumdar - ghosh spin chain to an external magnetic field forces the exposed spins to align with the field . because of polarization conservation , excess polarization opposite to the direction of the field",
    "is generated in the field - free region of the system . in the sector of zero total spin polarization ( @xmath33 ) , and for sufficiently large magnetic field strengths , this can cause spins far from the field region to switch to non - trivial polarized configurations , whereas for smaller applied fields they remain in a spin singlet product state .",
    "in contrast , in polarization sectors with @xmath34 excess polarization is trapped close to the region where the field is applied , and singlets are pushed far away from this field region .",
    "this is demonstrated graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_&_l_vs_h ] where parts ( a ) and ( b ) show the trace distance of two spins far from the locally applied magnetic field from a singlet for fields on an even and odd number of spins respectively . parts ( c ) and ( d ) show the polarization stored in the region with no applied magnetic field versus field strength , again for fields on an even and odd number of spins respectively . as figs .",
    "[ fig : sd_&_l_vs_h](a ) and ( b ) show , for local fields applied to regions with both an even and odd number of spins , there is always at least one polarization sector for which singlets are located far away from the field region .",
    "even for relatively small finite systems , such as the ones studied here , the ground state always lies in one of these sectors .",
    "it is also interesting to note from figs .",
    "[ fig : sd_&_l_vs_h](c ) and ( d ) that for a small field in the l=0 sector , the spins in the field - free area behaves differently , depending on whether the local field is applied to an odd or to an even number of spins .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for a field on an odd number of spins , the boundary between the field and the region with no field cuts through a singlet , in the original ground state . e.g.",
    "the field gradient makes one component of the singlet more energetically favorable than the other . by rotating these two spins between the singlet and the classical @xmath35 state",
    ", the ground state can be adjusted locally .",
    "when , however the field boundary is between two singlets , a critical local field strength must be reached for any polarization to be transferred from the field region to the field - free region as fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_&_l_vs_h](c ) demonstrates .",
    "this is because the matrix product state of singlets is still an eigenstate of the hamiltonian for any field strength in this case , and a level crossing must occur before the ground state can change .",
    "@xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig : entmap l1 h5 s4 ] shows the entanglement map of a system in the l=-1 global spin sector , with a magnetic field of h=5j applied on 4 of 16 spins .",
    "[ fig : entmap l1 h5 s4 ] suggests that for a range of field values , the distance from a singlet is caused by frustration from having an effectively odd number of spins available in the majumdar - gosh hamiltonian . in this case , however , the frustration is alleviated by an intermediate transition region between the field behavior and far from field behavior changing its length ( at the cost of some energy ) .",
    "@xcite          the way the system distributes polarization depends strongly on even - odd effects . to study the effects of polarization we examine fig .",

    "[ fig : open sdvsem](c ) and ( d ) one can tell that if the field is placed on an even number of spins , any polarization that is in the non - field region will be immediately spread , even to the furthest spins . in the case where the field is placed on an odd number of spins ,",
    "however , a finite amount of polarization can be sequestered near the boundary .",
    "[ fig : open sdvsem](a ) and ( b ) show that this trend is mirrored in distance from a singlet for far - away spins .",
    "the differences between the even - spin and odd - spin ground state for the zero - field spin chain can be used to explain why polarization sequestration can occur in one case and not the other .",
    "any spin @xmath36 spin chain with an odd number of spins and no applied local field must have a degenerate ground state because the particle - hole duality .",
    "the degenerate ground states also have different polarization and , therefore , 2 degenerate ground states with a continuum of polarization between @xmath37 and @xmath38 are possible .",
    "this means that for a chain which is effectively `` odd '' , there is no energy penalty for being anywhere in this range .",
    "this effect allows polarization to be spread throughout the no - field region without increasing the energy in that region .",
    "polarization can effectively be moved through this locally degenerate subspace , therefore polarization sequestration does not occur .",
    "conversely , for a spin chain which is effectively `` even '' , the ground state is unique , and polarization will tend to be localized in the ground state to avoid raising the energy of all of the no - field spins . as fig .",
    "[ fig : entmap l1 h5 s4 ] suggests , for certain field ranges in a given sector , the length of the non - field region of the chain is effectively `` odd '' .",
    "when this happens polarization can be spread freely throughout the non - field region , and sequestration does not occur , see fig .",
    "[ fig : frustration cartoon ] .          for very strong fields , the spins within the field should have no entanglement with the rest of the system , in low energy states .",
    "this is because the spins subjected to the field will align with the field .",
    "therefore an effective hamiltonian which acts only on the spins outside of the field should be able to describe the system in low energy states . a simple model for this hamiltonian would be to alter the coupling between the two spins closest to the field , with the supposition that the coupling with the field spins acts to mediate the interaction between the two spins coupled to them ( see fig . [ fig : coupling approx cartoon ] ) .",
    "the overlap between the known ground state , and the ground state calculated using the approximation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling approx cartoon ] for different added coupling strengths and different spins in the field region appear in fig .",

    "[ fig : coupling approx gs ] supports the claim that this approximation works fairly well in the ground state for a field on an odd number of spins . for numerical results",

    "the coupling listed here is the additional coupling added to the 2 closest spins to the field [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "unlike open boundary conditions , periodic boundaries present a case where the unperturbed hamiltonian has a degenerate ground state . therefore , the local hamiltonian for the spins far away from the region subjected to the local field will also always have a degenerate ground state .",
    "the complications from this degeneracy add a new series of effects which are not observed in the open - boundary case .",
    "these effects are illustrated by fig .",

    "[ fig : initial dist to av ] suggests that there is a strong correlation between polarization outside of the subsystem where a magnetic field is applied and quench disturbance to the far spins , in the sense that when the quench has a strong effect , there is a rapid change in polarization in the non - field region .",

    "the double - peaked pattern of equilibration seen here is typical of small systems , see @xcite , and is thus consistent with the theory that although the system itself is rather large @xcite , the actual evolution is only taking place on a few spins in or near the region of externally applied field , the rest of the system is simply being drug along by long range entanglement with these spins . as fig .",
    "[ fig : large quench statistics](c ) demonstrates , even though the dynamics is driven by long range entanglement with far away spins , a subsystem of spins is still able to be pushed toward equilibration in the trace distance sense .",
    "the fact that there is no local energy difference does not seem to interfere at all with equilibration of these spins . the trace distance from the average",
    "is observed quite close to zero at some times , unlike in similar quenches performed at the majumdar - ghosh point in @xcite .",
    "this is because an undisturbed singlet somewhere in the region being observed would yield a large distance from the average at all times as shown in @xcite where the quench did not cause a change in singlet coverings . in the case",
    "we are observing , where the coverings switch , there are no undisturbed singlets in the region away from the field spins .",
    "although the equilibration is globally poor in this system , there are no signs that equilibration via long - range entanglement through a locally degenerate subspace is any less effective than direct equilibration of the spins to which the field is applied .",
    "the data from this quench therefore indicate that the entire system can be equilibrated ( at least somewhat ) by a quench which only affects a very small region .",
    "in fact a system of any size should be able to be brought locally close to equilibrium in this way .",
    "because all states of the far spins locally have the same energy , than they can not affect the time evolution of the system , therefore the same behavior would be expected for a spin chain of any sufficiently long ( even ) length .",
    "one can now ask what would happen if the coupling were changed such that the system was no longer using the majumdar - ghosh hamiltonian , but allowed the next nearest neighbor coupling to take on arbitrary values , see eq .",
    "[ eq : j2 hamiltonian ] .",
    "this study is done with 20 spins and periodic boundary conditions , with a local magnetic field on 4 adjacent spins .",

    "fig : init2avj2 ] which shows the initial trace distance from average for a small field quench versus coupling and field strength .",
    "this data shows that for a wide range of coupling near the majumdar - ghosh point , small field quenches can drastically affect spins very far from the spins with an applied magnetic field at specific field strengths .",
    "however , when the field strength is eventually different enough , these peaks broaden out and disappear ( note logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : init2avj2 ] ) .",
    "the basic behavior seen previously in this paper holds for a wide range of couplings , where the ground state is no longer degenerate .    ]    for an infinite system one would expect that , far spins from the local magnetic field could not be disturbed by a local field quench unless either the system is gapless or there exists a degenerate ground state . for a finite system , this would only be necessarily true if the gap between the ground state and first excited state is sufficiently large compared to the energy introduced by the applied local magnetic field , in which case the field will be unable to introduce enough energy to affect the entire system . in this case the order of magnitude of the energy which the field introduces can be estimated by simply multiplying the field strength by the number of spins it is applied to . because both of the quantities are of order 1 , one would expect that the energy introduced would also be of order 1 .",
    "the energy gap in the system which will be used for this calculation can be determined by exact diagonalization .",
    "the energy of the gap between the ground state and first excited state of this system are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : differentj2 ] part ( c ) which shows the gap energy versus coupling at zero applied field , part ( a ) shows the initial distance from the average for 4 spins far from the locally applied magnetic field after a large quench ( within the @xmath37 sector ) , part ( b ) shows the local trace distance from the nearest singlet covering for spins far from the local field in the ground state of the @xmath37 sector versus field strength and coupling , and part ( d ) is the same as ( b ) , but with trace distance from the nearest state in the ground state manifold .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : differentj2](c ) that the gap energy is at most of order 0.1 , therefore , one would expect that for the entire range of couplings , the far spins could be disturbed by the local field .",
    "the results seen in fig . [ fig : init2avj2 ] are as expected , however if the system size were increased to infinity , one would expect that in the gapped region for @xmath420.25 , the peaks in the distance would have to disappear except for exactly at @xmath43=0.5 , or any other point with a degenerate ground state .",
    "twenty spins , however , is still too small a system for changes in the coupling to destroy the ability to dephase far spins with a local field , in other words the system can be considered to have an approximately degenerate ( wrt . the energy scale associated with the field )",

    "all plot except for ( a ) are static quantities relating to eigenstates . ]",
    "one can now ask whether the effects seen in fig . [",
    "fig : init2avj2 ] away from the majumdar - ghosh point are also caused by some kind of shift in singlet covering . to answer this question",
    ", one can compare fig .",
    "[ fig : differentj2](b ) to fig .",
    "[ fig : differentj2](d ) and notice that where the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : init2avj2 ] are located , the trace distance from either covering tends to be relatively large , but the distance from the subspace tends to be relatively small .",
    "this indicates that movement within the singlet subspace is the cause of much of the disturbance in the far spins .",
    "also interesting to note is that for a significant portion of the couplings , the spins far from the locally applied magnetic field are closest to the singlet subspace when the small field quenches have the most effect on far spins .",
    "it appears that even at many couplings away from the majumdar - ghosh point , the model of switching between coverings as a way to spread a disturbance throughout the system is accurate .",
    "in fact for many values of @xmath43 , the system appears to move into the singlet subspace for a narrow range of fields only when the covering change occurs . for @xmath44",
    "this model seems to break down , but it is still at least relevant for a large range of @xmath43 . although not directly related to the quench , it is interesting to note that above a certain local magnetic field strength the spins far from the field seem to lie on the singlet superposition manifold for a fairly large range of coupling strengths near majumdar - ghosh coupling , as well as a narrow strip between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the reason for this is not known .",
    "the results of a large local magnetic field quench over varying @xmath43 as shown in fig.[fig : differentj2](a ) simply helps to underscore what has already been noted about changing coupling not being an effective way of preventing disturbances from propagating throughout the system at this system size . not only do the large quenches have a significant effect on far spins from the local magnetic field for all coupling strengths , but the expected trend of decreasing quench effect with increasing gap is not visible in any definitive way , indicating that , not only is the energy scale of the gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : differentj2](c ) ) too small to be the dominating factor in the quench effectiveness , it seems to not even play a very significant role .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous energy scale argument , the energy scale associated with the field is always at least an order of magnitude larger than the gap between the first 2 eigenstates .",
    "in systems with degenerate ground states , quantum entanglement , disturbances , and charges can propagate freely , as long as the quench crosses between pre and post quench ground states which are locally different from each other far away from the region affected by the local quench .",
    "this effect is different and independent from gapless excitations , and has been demonstrated to occur in a gapped system . unlike in gapless systems where excitations carry an arbitrarily small amount of energy far from the quench ,",
    "these excitations store all energy locally near the quench , and evolution far away is driven solely by long - range entanglement .",
    "the local energy far from the region affected by a local quench hamiltonian is exactly zero in these systems , not arbitrarily small .    to allow a charge to be propagated through a degenerate subspace",
    ", the two degenerate ground states must have different local expectation values for said charge far from the region affected by a local quench hamiltonian .",
    "an effectively odd spin chain far from the field is allowed to propagate polarization throughout the far region for example .",
    "again , in such a case , long range entanglement can propagate the charge , but does not propagate any energy far from the field . in cases where two degenerate ground states with different expectation values for a charge far from the region",
    "where the quench is applied do not exist , the charge can become locally trapped in part of the system . in the case of the majumdar - ghosh hamiltonian , the polarization is trapped near the boundary of the local magnetic field region .",
    "a locally unique ground state ( in a gapped system ) means that charges , as well as disturbances , are confined after a local quench .",
    "energy arguments prevent a disturbance from traveling throughout the system and also therefore forbid charges from moving outside of a small area .    in the system",
    "studied here , a large local magnetic field causes the spins within the field to become effectively fixed , facing in the direction of the field in the ground state .",
    "an approximation which does not include these spins directly but includes an effective modulation in coupling between the two spins neighboring the field can faithfully reproduce the ground state when an odd number of spins remain . for the case",
    "that an even number of spins are left out of the field region , this simple approximation fails .",
    "we believe that the effective transition region between the field and non - field region consists of an odd number of spins , and that this ground state can not be faithfully reproduced in this way because of odd length frustration effects .    for majumdar - ghosh spin chains with periodic boundaries , with a local magnetic field on some even number of spins , there exists a range of fields where a small field quench can propagate a disturbance through the entire system using long range entanglement .",
    "this disturbance is propagated locally through the degenerate subspace of the local ground state . in this case",
    ", this range of fields is relatively narrow .",
    "a quench across this entire range does not only cause equilibration near the field , but also moves the far spins towards equilibration , within the locally degenerate subspace .",
    "study of systems with different next nearest neighbor coupling indicate that the basic effect which causes disturbances to be propagated to far spins can , at least for small enough systems , be extended away from the majumdar - ghosh point . for finite systems",
    ", if the gap between the ground state and the first excited state is small enough , the same effect which was described here for degenerate systems can also be applied to systems where the first 2 states are close in energy . in other words , under the right conditions , an approximate degeneracy will work in place of an exact degeneracy . for a system of 20 spins any value of @xmath43 between 0 and 1",
    "still allows the far spins to be significantly affected by the field .",
    "we strongly suspect that for the values of @xmath43where the hamiltonian is gapped and for which a degenerate ground state does not exist , spins far from a local magnetic field applied to a few spins can not be affected in the large system limit .",
    "the authors would like to thank n. tobias jacobson for his assistance in editing this paper .",
    "we would also like to thank s. garnerone , b. normand , and m. diez for valuable discussions .",

    "this work a has been supported by nsf grants : phy-803304,dmr- 0804914 .",
    "the only case where this is not observed is for the case of periodic boundary conditions with a local field applied to an even number of spins . in this case",
    "these spins orient locally like in the frustrated ground state of a majumdar - ghosh chain with an odd number of spins .",
    "an example of this would be to consider a superposition of the two singlet coverings .",
    "any non - adjacent spins will have exactly zero two - point entanglement ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : entmap ] ) .",
    "however , any set of two pairs of adjacent spins will have a finite entanglement between them . to see this ,",
    "consider the case where one set of two spins is measured to be both in the up direction . if there is an odd number of spins between the two spin pairs , this forces the other pair to be a singlet , regardless of the distance between the pairs",
    ".    showing that this happens consists of demonstrating that the singlet covering is an eigenstate of any field which does not change within a singlet .",
    "this can be seen by realizing that the field operator on the first spin of the singlet will give the zero magnetization triplet state @xmath49 , while the operator on the second spin will give the same but with a negative sign .",
    "thus the two will cancel making the singlet covering an eigenstate with a zero eigenvalue .",
    "the closeness to the boundary may also be a factor in the trace distance of the last 2 spins from a singlet , the fact that no entanglement can cross the open boundary may cause spins close to it to assume more localized states , however while this effect could make finite distances smaller , it should not be able to make the trace distance ( virtually ) zero as it is in many parts of fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_&_l_vs_h](a ) .",
    "note that the excitations which travel through a locally degenerate ground state are not the same as gapless excitations , which locally carry an arbitrarily small amount of energy .",
    "the parts of these excitations which exist far from the region affected by the local quench hamiltonian carry exactly zero energy locally .",
    "one could argue that 20 spins is not such a large system , but it has been shown that the spins far from the evolution are always locally in the degenerate subspace . adding more far spins and making the system into one which all of the readers would agree would be `` large '' ( for example making the system size 100,000 spins ) would not effect the dynamics , and the double peaked pattern would remain ."
