    "in the last two decades the discovery of high-@xmath4 superconductors , heavy - fermion compounds and organic conductors has revived interest in strongly correlated electron systems .",

    "@xcite the equation can be solved in the one - loop approximation . however , the obtained solution has a flaw  a negative spectral weight in two narrow frequency regions .",
    "@xcite this flaw can be remedied by an interpolation using results for regular regions .",
    "@xcite the obtained spectral function @xcite was shown to be in agreement with results of monte - carlo simulations @xcite at half - filling and for moderate temperatures when the magnetic correlation length is comparable with the intersite distance .",
    "in particular , it was shown that in agreement with results of monte - carlo and cluster methods @xcite the diagram technique is able to describe the four - band structure of the spectrum at half - filling .    in the present paper",
    "the same method is used for the investigation of the energy spectrum at a departure from half - filling .",
    "it is shown that in this case the above - mentioned four bands persist and additionally a new band arises in some vicinity of the fermi level . by its properties  the dispersion , bandwidth and the variation with filling ",
    "the band resembles the spin - polaron band of the @xmath0-@xmath3 model .",

    "there are no indications that the unit cell is doubled which manifests itself in a replication of some parts of the quasiparticle dispersion with the period @xmath105 .",
    "such a doubling is inherent in the antiferromagnetic order with a correlation length which is much larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "this limitation of the one - loop approximation is partly compensated by the fact , known from experiment in cuprates @xcite and from the @xmath0-@xmath3 model , @xcite that the correlation length decreases rapidly with departure from half - filling and becomes comparable to the lattice spacing already at @xmath121 even for temperatures @xmath122 .",

    "the most important differences are connected with the fact that the one - loop approximation overestimates the spectral intensity in the lower inner band near the momentum @xmath105 and in the upper inner band near @xmath104 .",

    "this is the reason why the spectra in the above figures were labeled with the chemical potential rather than with the concentration .",
    "now let us consider the @xmath0-@xmath2-@xmath1 model with the initial electron dispersion @xmath124 + 4t'\\cos(k_x ) \\cos(k_y)$ ] . both for the case of hole and electron doping the ratio @xmath10 of the hopping constants for the next - nearest and nearest neighbors is accepted .",

    "figure  [ fig_vii ] demonstrates the dispersions of the new band and of the lower ( upper ) inner band in the case of hole ( electron ) doping , the inner band being located above ( below ) the fermi level .",
    "the pseudogap between these bands becomes more pronounced with increasing @xmath9 in the case of electron doping ( cf .",
