    "the ratios of high - order cumulants ( from the 3rd to the 6th order ones ) of conserved quantities are suggested as sensitive measurements of the qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
    "recently , the ratios of low - order cumulants ( from the 1st to the 3rd order ones ) are turned out to be a useful probe of freeze - out temperatures  @xcite .",
    "so it is important to precisely determine the cumulants experimentally , and subtract the influence of non - critical effects .",
    "the initial size fluctuation is one of the important non - critical effects .",
    "although it has not been taken into account in most of the theoretical calculations  @xcite , it exists in all event variables in experiments .",
    "experimentally , the initial size is usually quantified by the collision centrality , which is determined by the multiplicity ( @xmath3 ) of the final state .",
    "a centrality bin corresponds to a range of multiplicity . for a given centrality bin ,",
    "i.e. , a range of multiplicity , the initial size still fluctuates from event to event  @xcite .",
    "therefore , its influence on high - order cumulants of conserved quantities can not be neglected  @xcite .    in order to reduce the initial size fluctuation ,",
    "it is suggested to calculate the cumulant at each of @xmath3 .",
    "the cumulant is averaged over all multiplicities in a given centrality , where the average is weighted by the number of events in each of @xmath3 .",
    "this is called the centrality bin width correction ( cbwc )  @xcite .",
    "the corrected cumulants obviously show less centrality dependence  @xcite .",
    "a precise estimation of the high - order cumulant requires larger statistics . at rhic / bes ,",
    "however , the number of events , or statistics , is not yet large enough . in this case",
    ", we should carefully check if the statistics are large enough for the cbwc method .    at the lowest rhic / bes energy ( @xmath4 gev ) ,",
    "the total available number of events for the analysis of net - proton and net - charge cumulants are only a few millions , and a few hundred millions at the top rhic / bes energy ( @xmath5 gev )  @xcite .",
    "the statistics in each of @xmath3 are much less than the whole data sample . as a rough estimation , for 0 - 5% centrality at @xmath4 gev , the number of events for the analysis of net - proton is around 0.19 million ( m ) .",
    "gev in au + au collisions . ignoring the efficiency loss at peripheral collisions",
    ", we just simply suppose that @xmath6 of the events are within the @xmath7 centrality .",
    "] there are around 100 multiplicity bins without considering the tail of the multiplicity distributions  @xcite .",
    "then the total number of events in the sample in each @xmath3 is just around 1900 .",
    "therefore , it should be carefully checked if these statistics are enough for the cbwc method .",
    "as we have discussed , the motivation of the cbwc method is to reduce the initial size fluctuation , but calculating cumulants in each of @xmath3 is not only the solution .",
    "in fact , many other factors , such as tracking inefficiency loss which can fluctuate event - by - event , and fluctuations in particle production , affect the multiplicity measurement .",
    "those factors invalidate the one - to - one correspondence of @xmath3 to initial size .",
    "if we select a proper multiplicity bin width which is approximately the size of the resolution of @xmath3 , those uncontrollable factors will be smeared .",
    "since the width of this kind of multiplicity bin is slightly wider than each of multiplicity and much narrower than the entire multiplicity region in a given centrality , the statistics will be largely improved , and the initial size fluctuations will be reduced as well .    in this paper ,",
    "the application of the cbwc method for the statistics of rhic / star experiments is carefully discussed by using the sample generated by the urqmd model .",
    "it is found that the statistics at low rhic / bes energies are not sufficient for applying the cbwc method , and the expectations of @xmath8 of net - proton and net - electric charge are obviously smaller than those with sufficient statistics .    in section iii , way to improve the cbwc method",
    "is proposed . instead of getting the cumulant in each of @xmath3 in a given centrality ,",
    "we show the statistics dependence of @xmath8 at various centrality bin widths . an appropriate centrality bin width is found , where a stable mean of @xmath8 is obtained and initial size fluctuation is well reduced with contemporary statistics at rhic / star experiments .",
    "finally , the summary is provided in section iv .",

    "although the particle production mechanism of the urqmd model may differ from that of a real experiment , statistics dependence of the cumulants should be a valuable reference for experimental data analysis .",
    "we focus our discussions on the case of au + au collisions at @xmath10 gev .",
    "its statistics are 6.6 m for net - proton , and 2.4 m for net - charge at rhic / bes as showed in table i  @xcite .",
    "we firstly simulate total 250 million minimum bias events , and then randomly divide the total events into 250 , 125 , 50 , 25 , 10 and 5 sub - samples .",
    "corresponding statistics for each kind of sub - samples are 1 m , 2 m , 5 m , 10 m , 25 m and 50 m , respectively .",
    "so we can see how the mean value at each kind of sub - sample change with the statistics .",
    "these statistics cover all of the cases at rhic / star shown in table i.    .statistics ( 0 - 80@xmath11 centrality ) at rhic / bes energies for net - proton and net - charge cumulant analysis .",

[ statistics - nch](a ) . where the x - axis is the number of total minimum bias events of each sub - sample .",
    "these errors are close to each other and correlated among the data points , because the simulation data used for all the data points are identical except that they are chopped into different numbers of sub - samples .",
    "therefore , the differences between the data points are real despite they are smaller than the drawn error bars . the results shown in this plot can be directly compared with the statistics at rhic / star showed in table i. the statistics we mentioned in the following are the minimum bias sample .    fig .",
