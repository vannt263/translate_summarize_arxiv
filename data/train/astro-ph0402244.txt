    "cepheid variables are fundamental objects for the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "distances of cepheids can be derived in at least two different ways : by using their observed mean magnitudes and periods together with a period - luminosity relation , or by applying a baade - wesselink ( hereafter bw ) type technique to determine their distances and mean diameters from their observed variations in magnitude , color and radial velocity .",
    "this latter technique has been dramatically improved by the introduction of the near - infrared surface brightness method ( hereafter irsb ) by @xcite , and later by @xcite who calibrated the relation between the @xmath1-band surface brightness and near - infrared colors of cepheids . for this purpose",
    ", they used the observed interferometric angular diameters of a number of giants and supergiants bracketting the cepheid color range .",
    "this method has been applied to a large number of galactic cepheid variables , for instance by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    applying the surface - brightness relation derived from stable stars",
    "to cepheids implicitly assumes that the relation also applies to pulsating stars .",
    "the validity of this assumption can now be addressed by comparing direct interferometric measurements of the angular diameter variation of a cepheid to the one derived from the irsb technique .",
    "it has recently been shown by @xcite , hereafter k04 , that the vlt interferometer on paranal is now in a condition to not only determine accurate _ mean _ angular diameters of nearby cepheid variables , but to follow their angular diameter _ variations _ with high precision . using the palomar testbed interferometer",
    ", @xcite resolved the pulsation of the cepheids @xmath2  gem and @xmath3  aql as early as 2000 , but the comparison we present in this letter is the first where error bars on the derived distance and linear diameter are directly comparable at a few percent level between the interferometric and irsb techniques .",
    "the star that we will discuss in this letter , @xmath0  car , is the brightest cepheid in the sky .",
    "its long period of about 35.5 days implies a large mean diameter , which together with its relatively short distance makes it an ideal target for resolving its angular diameter variations with high accuracy . in this paper",
    ", we will compare the interferometrically determined angular diameter curve of @xmath0  car with that determined from the irsb technique , and we will demonstrate that the two sets of angular diameters are in excellent agreement . based on the available high - precision angular diameter and radial velocity curves for this star , we will also derive a revised value of its distance and mean radius .",
    "several authors @xcite have pointed out potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the determination of cepheid distances using the interferometric bw method . in particular , imperfections in the numerical modeling of cepheid atmospheres",
    "could lead to biased estimates of the limb darkening and projection factor .",
    "we will discuss the magnitude of these uncertainties in the case of @xmath0  car .",
    "the interferometric observations of @xmath0  car were obtained with the vlt interferometer @xcite , using its commissioning instrument vinci @xcite and 0.35 m test siderostats .",
    "this instrument recombines the light from two telescopes in the infrared @xmath4 band ( 2.02.4@xmath5 m ) , at an effective wavelength of @xmath6 m .",
    "a detailed description of the interferometric data recorded on @xmath0  car can be found in k04 .",
    "the limb darkening ( ld ) models used to derive the photospheric diameters from the fringe visibilities were taken from @xcite .",
    "the correction introduced on the uniform disk ( ud ) interferometric measurements by the limb darkening is small in the @xmath4 band : for @xmath0  car , we determine @xmath7 . considering the magnitude of this correction , a total systematic uncertainty of @xmath8 appears reasonable .",
    "however , until the limb darkening of a sample of cepheids has been measured directly by interferometry , this value relies exclusively on numerical models of the atmosphere .",
    "this is expected to be achieved in the next years using for instance the longest baselines of the vlti ( up to 202 m ) and the shorter @xmath9 and @xmath10 infrared bands accessible with the amber instrument @xcite .",
    "the ld correction is changing slightly over the pulsation of the star , due to the change in effective temperature , but @xcite have estimated the amplitude of this variation to less than @xmath11 peak to peak in the @xmath10 band ( for the 10days period cepheid @xmath2  gem ) .",
    "it is even lower in the @xmath4 band , and averages out in terms of rms dispersion . as a consequence",
    ", we have neglected this variation in the present study .",
    "the limb - darkened angular diameter measurements are listed in table  [ table_angdiams_l_car ] .",
    "two error bars are given for each point , corresponding respectively to the statistical uncertainty ( internal error ) and to the systematic error introduced by the uncertainties on the assumed angular diameters of the calibrator stars ( external error ) .",
    "the phases given in table  [ table_angdiams_l_car ] are based on the new ephemeris derived in sect.[sec.diameter ] .",
    "these measurements were obtained during the commissioning of the vlti , and part of them are affected by relatively large uncertainties ( 3 - 5% ) due to instrumental problems .",
    "however , the precision reached by vinci and the test siderostats on this baseline is of the order of 1% on the angular diameter , as demonstrated around the maximum diameter phase .",
    "the irsb technique has been presented and discussed in detail in @xcite ( hereafter fg97 ) . in brief , the angular diameter curve of a given cepheid variable is derived from its @xmath1 light and @xmath12 color curve , appropriately corrected for extinction .",
    "it is then combined with its linear displacement , which is essentially the integral of the radial velocity curve . a linear regression of pairs of angular diameters and linear displacements , obtained at the same pulsation phases , yields both the distance , and the mean radius of the star .",
    "while there are several sources of systematic uncertainty in the method , as discussed in @xcite , one of its great advantages is its strong insensitivity to the adopted reddening corrections , and to the metallicity of the cepheid @xcite . with excellent observational data at hand ,",
    "individual cepheid distances and radii can be determined with an accuracy of the order of 5% _ if _ the adopted @xmath4-band surface brightness - color relation is correct .",
    "a first calibration of this relation coming directly from interferometrically determined angular diameters of cepheid variables was presented by @xcite ( herafter n02 ) .",
    "they found a satisfactory agreement with the fg97 calibration , within the combined 1@xmath13 uncertainties of both surface brightness - color calibrations .",
    "considering more closely the results from n02 , an even better agreement is found between the @xmath14 relations _ before _ the zero point if forced between the different colors . before this operation",
    ", n02 found the relation : @xmath15 that translates , after forcing the zero point to the average of the three selected colors , to the relation : @xmath16 on the other hand , fg97 obtain : @xmath17 from this comparison , it appears that the slope initially determined by n02 for @xmath14 is significantly different both from their final value and from the fg97 relation .",
    "this difference could cause a bias due to the averaging of the multi - color zero points .",
    "though small in absolute value , such a bias is of particular importance for @xmath0  car , due to its relatively large @xmath12 color .",
    "another argument in favor of the fg97 surface brightness relation is that it relies on a sample of 11 cepheids with periods of 4 to 39  days , while the relations established by n02 were derived from the observations of only 3 cepheids with periods of 5 to 10  days .",
    "such short period cepheids are significantly hotter than @xmath0  car ( @xmath18  days ) , and a local difference of the slope of the irsb relations can not be excluded .",
    "for these two reasons , we choose to retain the fg97 calibration for our analysis of the cepheid @xmath0  car in the following section .",
    "we have combined the photometric data from @xcite and @xcite to construct the @xmath1-band light curve for @xmath0  car .",
    "the two data sets are spanning almost 30 years and allow an improved determination of the period of this variable .",
    "we find @xmath19  days .",
    "the time of maximum @xmath1 light has been adopted from @xcite who give a value of @xmath20 which is also in good agreement with the more recent data .",
    "the resulting light curve is shown in fig.[fig.vk ] .",
    "the @xmath4 band light curve is based on the data from @xcite and is also shown in fig.[fig.vk ] .",
    "the @xmath12 color curve which is needed by the irsb method has been constructed on the basis of the observed @xmath1 band data and a fourier fit to the @xmath4-band data as described in @xcite .",
    "for the radial - velocity curve we have used the data from @xcite and @xcite . using the new ephemeris from above we detected a slight offset of 1.5  between the two datasets .",
    "we choose to shift the @xcite dataset by @xmath21  to bring all the data on the well established coravel system of @xcite .",
    "we note that the exact radial velocity zero point is irrelevant as the method makes use of _ relative _ velocities .",
    "the combined radial velocity data are displayed in fig.[fig.vk ] .",
    "the application of the irsb method has followed the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the same reddening law with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , a reddening of @xmath24 @xcite , and a projection factor , @xmath25 , from radial to pulsational velocity of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite we only consider the points in the phase interval from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ( phase zero is defined by the @xmath1 band maximum light ) .",
    "we have applied a small phase shift of @xmath29 to the radial velocity data to bring the photometric and radial velocity based angular diameters into agreement .",
    "we note that a similar phase shift can be achieved by lowering the systemic velocity by @xmath30  .",
    "the angular diameter curve obtained from the photometry has been plotted in fig.[fig.svb ] , together with the linear displacement curve .",
    "the photometric and interferometric diameter curves are directly compared in fig .",
    "[ fig.ldfit ] , where they are plotted as a function of phase . with these data",
    "we can compute the average angular diameters obtained from each technique .",
    "for the irsb , we find an average limb darkened angular diameter @xmath31 milliarcsecond , and for the interferometric measurements we find @xmath32 milliarcsecond .",
    "the agreement between these two values is strikingly good .",
    "this is a serious indication that the calibration of the surface brightness - color relation ( fg97 ) , based on non - pulsating giant stars , does apply to cepheids .",
    "the surface brightness method yields a distance of @xmath33  pc , and a mean radius of @xmath34  .",
    "the corresponding mean absolute @xmath1 magnitude is @xmath35  mag and the distance modulus is @xmath36 .",
    "the error estimates are all intrinsic 1@xmath13 random errors .",
    "in addition to these random errors , a systematic error of the order of 4% should be taken into account , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the final irsb values are thus @xmath37  pc , and @xmath38  . compared to @xcite",
    "we find a significantly ( 0.24  mag ) shorter distance modulus for @xmath0  car .",
    "this can be explained by the use in the present letter of the new and superior radial velocity data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "k04 found @xmath39 pc , using the interferometric angular diameters and a subset of the radial velocity data used here . to make the comparison more relevant",
    ", we determined the distance and radius using the same data ( interferometric diameters from table  [ table_angdiams_l_car ] and radial velocity from @xcite and @xcite  see above ) , the same ephemeris , and the same projection factor ( see sect  [ subsec.angular ] ) . using the method of k04",
    ", we find a distance @xmath40 , and a linear radius @xmath41  .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the values obtained from the irsb method .",
    "this 6% difference in the distances based on interferometric diameters ( 603pc for k04 versus 566pc here ) has two major causes .",
    "first , the @xmath25-factor used in the present paper is @xmath42% smaller than in k04 .",
    "the choice of the reference used for the @xmath25-factor has currently an impact of a few percents on its value .",
    "this indicates that the average value of the @xmath25-factor for a given cepheid is currently uncertain by at least a similar amount , and this systematic error translates linearly to the distance determination .",
    "secondly , the use of a different  and superior  data set for the radial velocity makes the radius curve different from k04 .",
    "in particular the amplitude is smaller here than in k04 by @xmath43% .",
    "this is likely due to the more complete phase coverage that we have here , and possibly also to a different choice of spectral lines to estimate the radial velocity .",
    "this amplitude difference translates linearly on the distance through the bw method .",
    "the main point of our paper is to show that with a consistent treatment of the data , the internal accuracy of both methods ( irsb or interferometry ) is extremely good : the angular diameter variation observed using the vlti agrees very well with that derived from the @xmath14 version of the irsb technique as calibrated by fg97 .",
    "for all the interferometric measurements , the corresponding irsb angular diameter at the same phase lies within the combined 1@xmath13 error bars of the two measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig.ldfit ] ) .",
    "even more importantly , the mean angular diameter of the cepheid as derived from both independent sets of angular diameter determination are in excellent agreement , within a few percents .",
    "unfortunately , this is not equivalent to say that the cepheid distance scale is calibrated to a 1% accuracy .",
    "we have drawn attention to remaining sources of systematic errors that can affect cepheid radii and distances up to several percents . as an illustration of these sources , k04 obtain a distance @xmath44pc for @xmath0  car , while we obtain @xmath40pc from the same interferometric data .",
    "we have already shown that most of the 6% difference ( equivalent to @xmath45 ) can be explained by the use of different radial velocity data and projection factor . another thing to consider is the phase interval used .",
    "k04 used measurements over the whole pulsation cycle whereas in the irsb technique , one avoids the phase interval 0.81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.svb ] ) . during that phase interval",
    ", that corresponds to the rebound of the atmosphere around the minimum radius , energetic shock waves are created .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , they produce asymmetric line profiles in the cepheid spectrum .",
    "recent modeling using a self - consistent dynamical approach also show that the @xmath46 photosphere may not be comoving with the atmosphere of the cepheid during its pulsation , at the 1% level @xcite .",
    "such an effect would impact the @xmath25-factor , modify the shape of the radial velocity curve , and thus bias the amplitude of the radius variation , possibly up to a level of a few percents .",
    "as the bw method ( either its classical or interferometric versions ) relies linearly on this amplitude , a bias at this level presently can not be excluded .    the interferometric bw method is currently limited to distances of 12 kpc , due to the limited length of the available baselines .",
    "the irsb technique on the other hand can reach extra - galactic cepheids as already demonstrated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for the lmc ) and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for the smc ) .",
    "using high precision interferometric measurements of @xmath0  car and other cepheids , it will be possible to calibrate the irsb method down to the level of a few percents . from the present comparison",
    ", we already see that this fundamental calibration will be very similar to the calibration found by fg97 and @xcite .",
