    "the kinematics of deep - inelastic electron proton scattering ( dis ) by neutral current exchange ( nc ) ,    @xmath3    is characterized by the mass squared ( @xmath4 ) of the exchanged current and the bjorken scaling variable @xmath1 . in a hermetic detector , @xmath0 and @xmath1",

    "the determination of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is erroneous when the incoming electron radiates a photon before the hard interaction takes place ( initial state radiation , isr ) .",
    "when averaged over a large dis event sample , the effect of isr in general is rather small .",
    "between 10 and 100 gev@xmath5 , roughly 6@xmath6 of the events have an isr photon carrying between 5 and 20@xmath6 of the energy of the incident electron .",
    "] however , isr can have an important effect when , due to isr , events produced in a @xmath7 region of large cross section migrate into a region where the cross section is expected to be small .",
    "an example for such a constellation is presented by the possible excess of high-@xmath1 , high-@xmath0 events recently observed at hera  @xcite .",
    "most of the isr photons are emitted very close to the direction of the electron such that the emission angle can be assumed to be zero ( peaking approximation ) .",

    "this note presents the relevant formulae in a form suitable for hera experiments and illustrates the migration of events due to isr in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 planes , where @xmath15 is the effective mass of the electron current quark system .",

    "the method rests on the assumption that the total transverse momentum carried by those hadrons which escape detection through the beam hole in the proton direction as well as the energy carried by particles escaping through the beam hole in the electron direction can be neglected .",
    "the result is : @xmath45    the double - angle ( da ) method of  @xcite uses the electron scattering angle and the angle @xmath46 which characterizes the longitudinal and transverse momentum flow of the hadronic system ( in the naive quark - parton model @xmath46 is the scattering angle of the struck quark ) : @xmath47    leading to @xmath48    the energy of the scattered electron obtained by the da - method is : @xmath49    the @xmath50 method  @xcite combines the measurements of the energies and angles of the electron and hadron system . making use of the relation @xmath51 which holds exactly for a hermetic detector",
