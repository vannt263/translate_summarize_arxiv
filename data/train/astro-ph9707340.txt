    "only in recent years has it become accepted that our galaxy is barred . for decades",
    "the prevailing assumption had been that the central concentration of stars , hidden by intervening dust , could be described by a spheroid in which the density of stars fell as a power of the distance from the center .",
    "so much was suggested by the distribution of globular clusters in the galaxy , and by the structure of elliptical galaxies and the apparent shape of the central bulges of many spiral galaxies viewed edge - on .",
    "what little observational evidence there was , obtained by counting stars in low - extinction windows toward the inner galaxy , did not disprove this notion .",
    "some examples of spheroidal bulge models may be found in de vaucoleurs & pence ( 1978 ) , bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) , kent ( 1992 ) , and zhao ( 1996 ) .",
    "meanwhile , radioastronomy had been accumulating evidence that the inner part of the galaxy is less neatly arranged .",
    "the radial velocities of gas in the inner few kiloparsecs was found to be inconsistent with travel in circular orbits . in some directions ,",
    "the velocity is so great that the gas was proposed to lie in an  expanding three - kiloparsec arm \" ( oort , kerr & westerhout 1958 ) between us and the center ; and in general , its motion seemed predominantly outward , as if the gas were being driven by titanic explosions near the galactic center ( burbridge & hoyle 1963 ) , but this notion lost favor as the improbably vast energy , and driven mass , required of such explosions came to be better understood ( sanders & prendergast 1974 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the gas is moving in non - circular orbits because the potential it lies in is asymmetric , perhaps due to a bar , as de vaucoleurs ( 1964 ) suggested .",
    "other came to a similar conclusion , among them liszt & burton ( 1980 ) and gerhard & vietri ( 1986 ) .",
    "binney et al . ( 1991 ) took this analysis further . from the kinematics of , co and cs",
    ", they deduced the presence of a bar whose near end lay in the first galactic quadrant , tilted @xmath2 from the line joining sun and galactic center .    by this time information from stars in the central part of the galaxy had begun to arrive , mostly from observations in the mid- and near - infrared .",
    "harmon & gilmore ( 1986 ) constructed a picture of the shape of the stellar bulge by selecting mira variables , whose period is a function of luminosity , from the iras point source catalog on the basis of color .",
    "they found the bulge to be flattened in @xmath3 and , though they did not remark on it , the outer contours of their fig .",
    "3a show the bulge to be broader at positive longitudes .",
    "nakada et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , whitelock & catchpole ( 1992 ) , and weinberg ( 1992 ) also found this effect in the distribution of iras miras , and noted it was consistent with the appearance of a bar with near end in the first quadrant .",
    "more evidence came through the near - infrared .",
    "matsumoto et al . (",
    "1982 ) had mapped the surface brightness of the bulge at 2.4 @xmath0 m ; the pattern of the longitudinal asymmetry of this map was read by blitz & spergel ( 1991 ) as the clear signature of a bar .",
    "the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) mapped the entire sky in 10 wavelength bands , including four in the near - infrared ( boggess et al .",
    "weiland et al .",
    "( 1994 ) corrected the dirbe 2.2 @xmath0 m map for extinction and subtracted an extrapolated projection of the galactic disk , leaving behind a boxy , very bar - like object that seems to loom forward into the first quadrant .",
    "dwek et al .",
    "( 1995 ) applied a variety of bar and spheroid models to this same data , and concluded that the bulge is definitely a bar , with a tilt angle of @xmath4 .",
    "gravitational microlensing has recently been proposed as a means of studying the inner galaxy .",
    "results from the ogle project regarding the bar are still preliminary ( paczyski et al . 1994 ) , but the stellar database assembled for the project has allowed stanek et al . (",
    "1997 ) to discover a bar tilted @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "freudenreich ( 1996 , henceforth paper i ) , presented a model of the galactic disk derived from the dirbe observations at 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 and 4.9 @xmath0 m , where the surface brightness is dominated by red giants .",
    "the dirbe photometric bands approximate the standard @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "( here the  d \" subscript used to denote dirbe in paper i will be omitted . )",
    "the model presumed that mature stars and the diffuse component of the interstellar dust each form a homogeneous , possibly warped , disk ; if the structure of the galaxy appears different in different near - infrared bands , it is due solely to the wavelength - dependent extinction and emission by dust .",
    "the model fit the data very well , except in the directions of nearby molecular clouds , which a smooth dust model can not account for , and toward the inner @xmath11 kiloparsecs of the galaxy , which had been intentionally masked out to avoid the bulge . in this paper",
    "i have used the same data but expanded the model to include the bulge and the inner part of the disk .",
    "the  young disk \" ( the  thin disk \" in paper i ) , the ragged collection of molecular clouds , young stars , and associated dust concentrated at the galactic plane , makes penetration of the inner part of the galaxy difficult , but in the near - infrared the extinction is low enough that , with the proper techniques , we can discern structure to within roughly half a kiloparsec of the center .",
    "subsequent sections discuss the data reduction and optimization scheme , the model itself , how well it fits the data , its residuals , and what it tells us about the galaxy .",
    "there are frequent references to paper i , in particular for a more detailed explanation of the data reduction and a review of the model parameters pertaining to the disk , but all the information needed to understand the model is included here .",
    "comparison to others work is made in the course of discussing the parameters of the model .",
    "the analysis was performed on cylindrical equal - area projections of the dirbe full - sky surface brightness maps , each map consisting of 391,612 pixels .",
    "the zodiacal light was modeled and removed , and point sources ( nearby stars and a few supergiants ) filtered out .",
    "( see paper i for a more detailed explanation . ) at low latitudes , @xmath12 , unresolved sources dominate the dirbe surface brightness , but at higher latitudes the contribution of point sources can not be neglected . to account for the deleted point sources",
    ", the simplifying assumption was made that all stars within a  deletion distance \" @xmath13 of the sun were filtered out , which in effect places us at the center of a star - free bubble .",
    "there are three deletion distances : for the @xmath7 , the @xmath8 , and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "the @xmath10 band does not have its own deletion distance because at high galactic latitudes it is seriously contaminated by zodiacal light or artifacts of its removal .",
    "maps of the near - infrared colors were then used to identify and mask anomalously red areas of the sky , most of which are strongly associated with molecular clouds .",
    "the mask derived from the @xmath14 color has been retained from paper i , without , of course , the rectangle covering the galactic bulge . in the inner galaxy , this mask covers everything within approximately three degrees of the galactic equator .",
    "a second mask , chosen on the basis of @xmath15 color , has been added for use with the @xmath7-band map only .",
    "see fig .  [ sample ] .",
    "( from this point on , the term  primary mask \" refers to both of these masks used in conjunction . )",
    "the magellanic clouds and the heart of the barnard 78 cloud complex ( @xmath16 ) were excluded by rectangular masks .",
    "shrinking the masked area would certainly introduce more contamination by young - disk features , which the robust fitting procedure might or might not be able to accomodate , yet there are reasons to consider doing so .",
    "one is that we could approach the galactic center more closely .",
    "another is that the mask is an implicit parameter of the fit , and by using more than one we can gauge our sensitivity to it . as further justification",
    ", we may note that a line of sight at low latitude toward the inner galaxy can accumulate a great deal of reddening solely from diffuse dust , which the model is intended to account for , in an averaged way .",
    "therefore i created a  minimal \" mask . for @xmath17 or @xmath18 ,",
    "it is identical to the primary mask for all four bands , but interior to this only the barnard 78 clouds and a narrow strip ( @xmath19 ) along the galaxy s brightness crest , which has been eroded by point - source removal , are excluded .    as a further precaution against zodiacal light residue , a zone of low ecliptic latitude @xmath20",
    "was also rejected , regardless of mask , in the disk region . for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath21 ; for @xmath10 , @xmath22 .",
    "the maps were divided into bulge and disk regions .",
    "the bulge region is defined as @xmath23 , @xmath24 ; the disk region is everywhere else .",
    "the model was optimized separately for multiple samples of pixels taken from the dirbe maps .",
    "a sample of pixels was chosen , the fit made , its figures of merit and parameter values recorded , a new sample chosen , a new starting point in parameter space chosen at random , and the process repeated .",
    "the disk region was represented by 660 pixels , only 60 taken from @xmath25 , where a line of sight spans a smaller portion of the galactic plane .",
    "the bulge region was represented by 170 pixels , out of the possible 6,795 which remain after the primary mask has been applied .",
    "the pixels comprising each sample were selected quasi - randomly , to ensure uniform spatial coverage without imposing the artificial regularity of a grid . in the disk region , the density of selected pixels was low enough that each sample was virtually unique , but in the bulge region some pixels were selected more than once , and some ( 5% ) never .",
    "the results presented are the averages over fits to 60 samples , but due to overlap between samples in the bulge region , this is no better than having only 37 independent samples of the same size . the number of pixels in the bulge region limits how well the mean of any given parameter can be determined .",
    "in fitting the model , the figure of merit was calculated separately for each band in each of the two regions , then weighted means taken to form a disk figure of merit and a bar figure of merit . in the disk region , @xmath10 is the least trustworthy band due to residual zodiacal light , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 the most trustworthy .",
    "i assigned bands @xmath7 through @xmath10 the relative weights 1.0 , 2.0 , 2.0 , 0.1 . in the bulge region , zodiacal light residue is negligible and extinction makes @xmath7 the least useful band .",
    "there i assigned the relative weights 0.1 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 3.0 . changing the relative weights in either region had little effect on the final result , as long as most of the weight was not given to either @xmath7 in the bulge region or @xmath10 in the disk region .",
    "the figures of merit for the disk and bar were then averaged to arrive at a single figure .",
    "the relative weights of disk and bulge proved unimportant .",
    "few of the parameters significantly affected the quality of fit in both regions .    in paper",
    "i , the figure of merit was not the @xmath26 but a statistically robust quantity : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes pixel number and the angular brackets a bisquare - weighted average over pixels . unlike @xmath26 , @xmath29 can accomodate small - scale irregularities in galactic structure , such as the deep patchy extinction associated with molecular clouds , that remain even after applying the exclusion mask , and defy any smooth model .",
    "another advantage of a robust figure of merit is that by giving less weight to a lesser component it aids in cleanly dividing the galaxy into components : bar plus disk plus ",
    "whatever appears in the final residuals .",
    "estimates of the measurement errors @xmath30 were obtained from the scatter about polynomial fits to the local surface brightness .",
    "( see paper i. ) although @xmath29 has the basic characteristics desired of the figure of merit , it makes no quantitative statement about the validity of the model in any case , and it has been replaced by a measure that is simpler and at least makes more intuitive sense : the mean absolute fractional deviation ( mad ) , obtained by substituting @xmath31 for @xmath30 in the equation above .",
    "the optimization algorithm was based on the simulated annealing method ( press et al .",
    "it never failed to converge .",
    "my intention was to build a simple model .",
    "i still consider the model simple , overly simple in some respects , but , grudgingly , parameter by parameter , it grew to a minimum of 47 free parameters .",
    "seven pertain to the data reduction , 11 to the dust layer , 15 to the disk , 12 ( to 14 ) to the bar , and two to the location of the sun .",
    "a few of the symbols representing the parameters have been changed since paper i in the interest of clarity , as their number has multiplied ; these changes are noted in the text .",
    "the parameters are explained in the subsections that follow , and are labeled later on when their values are tabulated .",
    "modeling was done in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath32 ) , with the sun at @xmath33 , and @xmath34 measured counter - clockwise , looking down from positive @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is free .",
    "the model consists of an exponential stellar disk , a bar , and an exponential disk of diffuse dust .",
    "a thick disk is not included .",
    "as noted in paper i , a thick disk is superfluous to reproducing the observed surface brightness . if one exists , it is too faint for the dirbe to discern . after some experimentation with a halo model , a halo was rejected for the same reason .",
    "the intensity at frequency @xmath36 in the direction @xmath37 is obtained by integrating the volume emissivity per unit solid angle @xmath38 along the line of sight @xmath39 : @xmath40 the additive offset @xmath41 absorbs the extragalactic background and possibly zodiacal light and filtering artifacts .",
    "the extinction term @xmath42 is calculated from the dust model .",
    "the modeled disk is exponential in @xmath43 , outer - truncated in @xmath43 , inner - truncated in @xmath43 , @xmath44 in @xmath3 , and warped .",
    "the model does not force the truncations and warping , but allows them to occur if the data so dictate .    for @xmath45 , another free parameter ,",
    "the modeled disk is flat . for @xmath46",
    ", it is allowed to bend upward on one side and downward on the other , with a straight line of nodes at azimuth @xmath47 .",
    "letting @xmath48 , the mean elevation from the flat reference plane established by the inner galaxy is : @xmath49 \\sin(\\theta\\!-\\!\\theta_w).\\ ] ]    in paper i , giving the disk a hole in its center , as in a freeman type ii galaxy ( freeman 1970 ) , produced more plausible residuals than leaving it purely exponential .",
    "holes have been found in the disks of other barred spirals ( ohta , hamabe & wakamatsu 1990 ) , though not all ( baggett , baggett & anderson 1996 ) , and this is a natural outcome in @xmath50-body simulations , in which a bar forms from an instability in the disk ( hohl 1971 ; schwartz 1984 ; noguchi 1996 and references therein ) . therefore the modeled disk is permitted a central hole . since the inner part of the disk",
    "can not be expected to be axisymmetric in the presence of a strong bar , the hole is permitted an eccentricity .",
    "the hole is implemented through the function : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is real and @xmath53 is calculated in the bar frame , in which @xmath54 is defined by the bar s major axis .",
    "the axis ratio of the hole is @xmath55 .",
    "this @xmath56 was the best of three three - parameter functions tried , and arose naturally from the best of several two - parameter functions , @xmath57 .",
    "freeman s ( 1970 ) suggested @xmath58 was not among the better two - parameter functions , being too steep .",
    "the less - successful three - parameter functions were of logistic and algebraic forms .",
    "the full expression for the volume emissivity of the disk in each of the four bands is : @xmath59 where @xmath60 the truncation radius @xmath61 and the central emissivity ( in the absence of a hole ) @xmath62 are also free parameters .",
    "( the symbol  @xmath63 \" replaces the  @xmath64 \" used in paper i. )    the scale length @xmath65 and scale height @xmath66 are constant .",
    "this assumption may not be strictly valid in the outer galaxy , where dark matter comes to dominate the mass .",
    "in particular , @xmath66 may grow with @xmath43 , as does the scale height of the layer ( burton 1976 ) .",
    "i attempted to allow for this effect by including two additional parameters : a rate of change of @xmath66 with @xmath43 , and a radius beyond which the change occurs .",
    "this proved fruitless . whether the scale height was a function of @xmath43 or @xmath67 ,",
    "the additional freedom did not lead to a significant change in the figure of merit of the fit .",
    "it did allow the truncation radius @xmath61 to be moved outward a kiloparsec or two , but did not provide justification for the move , or for itself , and so was dropped .",
    "the model of the dust layer is used to calculate extinction and emission by dust , and possibly some of the light scattered by dust .",
    "the dust layer has the same form as the stellar disk , though with its own scale height ( @xmath68 ) , scale length ( @xmath69 ) , and hole parameters ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "the eccentricity of the dust layer s hole is forced to that of the disk .",
    "the dust layer is given a warp with the same line of nodes , but an amplitude that differs by a scale factor @xmath72 : @xmath73 .",
    "this was done because freudenreich et al .",
    "( 1994 ) noted that , in surface brightness maps , the dust layer as observed in the far - infrared appears to be warped through a greater amplitude than the stellar disk , and because the mean distances of the disk stars and the dust that is important to the model ( foreground dust ) may not be the same .",
    "two changes have been made since paper i. the radial dependence of the dust density , in the absence of a central hole , has been changed from @xmath74 to @xmath75 to be consistent with the form of the stellar disk ; and due to the greater sensitivity to extinction , now that more of the inner galaxy is included , the extinction law of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) has been replaced by a power law in wavelength , @xmath76^{-\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are free .",
    "it is likely the scale height of the dust layer , like that of the layer , grows outside the solar circle , but the optical depth there is too low for the model to grasp such detail .",
    "dust emission at these wavelengths is assumed to be due to fluorescence or stochastic heating caused by _",
    "o _ and _ b _ stars with the same scale length as the old disk , but with the warping ( @xmath79 ) and the scale height ( @xmath68 ) of the dust .",
    "the dust emissivity at any point is proportional to the product of the dust density and the uv emissivity within a uv absorption length ( @xmath80^{-1/3}$ ] ) , so that @xmath81 note that as a product of the dust density and a stellar emissivity , the emissivity of the dust falls off more rapidly in @xmath43 and @xmath3 than either alone .",
    "dust - scattered starlight is neglected .",
    "however , since it is proportional to the dust density , and nearly isotropic at these wavelengths , there will be an apparent correlation between scattering and emission , and some scattered light will find its way into @xmath82 .",
    "other spiral galaxies show a great variety in the shapes of their bars , as they do in many things , but some generalities have been drawn .",
    "a typical bar is straight .",
    "its brightness along the major axis varies from roughly exponential to roughly flat , and often ends abruptly .",
    "the flatter bars tend to belong to galaxies of earlier hubble type , and to be stronger , often joining directly to spiral arms or a ring ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1984 ; elmegreen et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the outer part of a bar often has a somewhat rectangular appearance when viewed face - on ( ohta et al .",
    "see kormendy ( 1977 ) and sellwood & wilkinson ( 1993 ) for general information .",
    "the simplest bar shape is an ellipsoid .",
    "more realistically , a  generalized ellipse \" has been proposed by athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for the two - dimensional case of a galaxy observed face - on : @xmath83 elliptical when @xmath84 , diamond- or lozenge - shaped when @xmath85 , and boxy when @xmath86 .",
    "this can be generalized to three dimensions : @xmath87 the effective radius is @xmath88 ; the scale lengths are @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ; and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the face - on and edge - on shape parameters .",
    "a bar may appear diamond - shaped from one vantage point and boxy from another .",
    "athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and athanassoula ( 1992a ) found that both the ellipticity and the shape parameter of face - on galaxies varied with @xmath43 , but after some unsuccessful experimentation with an @xmath43-dependent @xmath92 and @xmath94 ratio , i decided to leave these parameters single - valued .",
    "the radial dependence of the bar must cover the range of flat to exponential .",
    "i have tried three functions flexible enough to model this characteristic , when coupled with a term that truncates them radially : @xmath95 model s has the fewest parameters . at first , the power of the sech function was left free , but in test runs it settled so close to a value of 2.0 that i fixed it there . giving the bar and disk the same functional @xmath3-dependence has the advantage of allowing the direct comparison of scale heights .",
    "model e , an exponential - to - a - power , fit almost as well , but at the price of an extra free parameter , the power @xmath96 .",
    "an @xmath96 of 1.0 would give us an exponential bar , the form recommended by stanek et al .",
    "an @xmath96 of 2.0 would match the radial dependence of the best - fitting model of dwek et al .",
    "model p , a power law with core radius @xmath97 , led to a distinctly inferior fit .",
    "the bar would possibly be better fit using a different function , rather than just a different scale length , along each axis , but i am reluctant to enter this wilderness of functional combinations without the firm guidance of theory .    to truncate the bar at radius @xmath98 , its density is multiplied by a gaussian function with scale length @xmath99 . both @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "are free parameters . in model",
    "s , for example , the volume emissivity of the bar is : @xmath100    the bar has two more degrees of freedom : a tilt angle @xmath101 ( a clockwise rotation about the @xmath3 axis from the sun - center line ) and a pitch angle ( the angle between the bar s major axis and the galactic plane ) .",
    "a dust lane often runs along the leading edge of a bar , but is not included in my model , in the belief that masking the low - latitude sky would hide it .",
    "if a dust lane is present , we must search for it in the residuals .",
    "the mean absolute deviations of the models , obtained using the primary mask , are given by table 1 .",
    "these are averages over the 60 fits .",
    "the mad was the quantity optimized , but @xmath29 and the @xmath26 per degree of freedom were also calculated and are included .",
    "ideally , the values of @xmath26 and @xmath29 would be 1.0 and 0.77 respectively , but due to the presence of the young disk , the figures of merit would not approach the ideal values even if the models of the bar and the old disk were perfect . in any case , the figures of merit are only relative and do not provide confidence limits on a model .",
    "the formal uncertainties are omitted , except in the last column , containing the weighted mean values .",
    "as expected , by all measures the @xmath7-band fit is the worst in the bar region , and the @xmath10-band fit the worst in the disk .",
    "the @xmath9 band , with low extinction and very little remaining zodiacal light , provides the best fit , judging by @xmath29 and @xmath26 .",
    "( the mad can not be used to compare different bands . )    in the disk region , the figures of merit of all the models are approximately equal , indicating the exponential part of the disk has been successfully decoupled from the inner part . in the bar region ,",
    "model s has a small but consistent superiority over model e , while model p is a poor third .",
    "when the minimal mask was used , all figures of merit worsened , mad by @xmath102% over its previous value , but the relative quality of fit among the models did not change .",
    "( they were not tabulated for this reason . )    a penalty incurred by smoothing away point sources must be discussed before contour plots of the data and model are presented .",
    "because of the broad dirbe beam , it is difficult distinguishing between nearby stars and pointlike but extended distant sources , such as those on the brightness crest of the inner galaxy . as a consequence",
    ", the brightness crest is rounded off .",
    "the effect of this on the old disk can be gauged by applying the same procedure to the modeled @xmath9-band surface brightness map . in fig .",
    "[ smoothfac ] we have the difference between the unsmoothed and smoothed maps , from model s , as a fraction of the unsmoothed map s surface brightness .",

    "x \" appears where the corners of the bulge have been eroded , but it is very faint and fills only a small part of the bulge region .",
    "this figure tells us that if data and model are to be compared over the whole sky , and not just over the non - masked area , both must be either smoothed or unsmoothed .",

    "there is more extinction , especially at positive latitudes , than the model predicts .",
    "proceeding from the @xmath7 through the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 bands , the extinction lessens and the negative residue approaches zero .",
    "it does not reach zero , however , which suggests a flaw in the model , perhaps in its treatment of the dust layer .",
    "there is much information in these plots of residuals , but as that information does not include distances , they should be interpreted with care .",
    "most prominent in the residuals is a bright nucleus roughly @xmath103 ( or 300 pc , at a distance of 8.5 kpc ) in diameter .",
    "this becomes brighter and morphologically simpler as the observing wavelength increases , and probably does occupy the center of the galaxy , a unique environment in which the model is certainly inadequate ( see , for example , morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "there is also a bright narrow ridge in the inner galaxy along the galactic midplane , probably created by stars associated with the young disk , red supergiants in particular .",
