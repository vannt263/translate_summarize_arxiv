    "quantum optics is usually concerned with the generation of nonclassical states of the electromagnetic field and their experimental detection . however with the recent rapid progress in the theory of quantum information processing the _ protection _ of quantum states and their quantum dynamics",
    "also is becoming a very important issue .",
    "in fact what makes quantum information processing much more attractive than its classical counterpart is its capability of using entangled states and of processing generic linear superpositions of input states . the entanglement between a pair of systems",
    "is capable of connecting two observers separated by a space - like interval , it can neither be copied nor eavesdropped on without disturbance , nor can it be used by itself to send a classical message @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using linear superposition states has given rise to quantum computation , which is essentially equivalent to have massive parallel computation @xcite . however",
    "all these applications crucially rely on the possibility of maintaining quantum coherence , that is , a defined phase relationship between the different components of linear superposition states , over long distances and for long times .",
    "this means that one has to minimize as much as possible the effects of the interaction of the quantum system with its environment and , in particular , _ decoherence _ ,",
    "i.e. , the rapid destruction of the phase relation between two quantum states of a system caused by the entanglement of these two states with two different states of the environment @xcite .",
    "quantum optics is a natural candidate for the experimental implementation of quantum information processing systems , thanks to the recent achievements in the manipulation of single atoms , ions and single cavity modes .",
    "in fact two quantum gates have been already demonstrated @xcite in quantum optical systems and it would be very important to develop strategies capable of _ controlling the decoherence _ in experimental situations such as those described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the possibility of an experimental control of decoherence is important also from a more fundamental point of view .",
    "in fact decoherence is the practical explanation of why linear superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states , the states involved in the famous schrdinger cat paradox @xcite , are never observed and how the classical macroscopic world emerges from the quantum one @xcite . in the case of macroscopic systems , the interaction with the environment can never be escaped ; since the decoherence rate is proportional to the `` macroscopic separation '' between the two states @xcite , a linear superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states is immediately changed into the corresponding statistical mixture , with no quantum coherence left . nonetheless , a full comprehension of the fuzzy boundary between classical and quantum world is not yet reached @xcite , and therefore the study of `` schrdinger cat '' states in _ mesoscopic _ systems where one can hope to observe the decoherence is important .",
    "a first achievement has been obtained by monroe _",
    "@xcite , who have prepared a trapped @xmath0 ion in a superposition of spatially separated coherent states and detected the quantum coherence between the two localized states .",
    "however , in this experiment the decoherence of the superposition state has not been studied .",
    "the progressive decoherence of a mesoscopic schrdinger cat has been observed for the first time in the experiment of brune _",
    "et al_. @xcite , where the linear superposition of two coherent states of the electromagnetic field in a cavity with classically distinct phases has been generated and detected .    in this paper",
    "we propose a simple physical way to control decoherence and protect a given quantum state against the destructive effects of the interaction with the environment : applying an appropriate feedback .",
    "we shall consider a radiation mode in a cavity as the quantum system to protect and we shall show that the `` lifetime '' of an initial quantum state can be significantly increased and its quantum coherence properties preserved for quite a long time .",
    "the feedback scheme considered here has a quantum nature , since it is based on the injection of an appropriately prepared atom in the cavity and some preliminary aspects of the scheme , and its performance , have been described in refs .",
    "the present paper is a much more detailed description of our approach to quantum state protection and is organized as follows . in section ii , the main idea is presented and a continuous feedback scheme for optical cavities is studied . in section iii , a possible application of this continuous feedback scheme to quantum information processing systems as the quantum phase gate of ref .",
    "@xcite is presented . in the remaining sections , the stroboscopic version of the continuous feedback scheme , more suited for the microwave cavity of the brune _",
    "_ experiment @xcite , and first introduced in @xcite , is discussed in detail .",
    "applying a feedback loop to a quantum system means subjecting it to a series of measurements and then using the result of these measurements to modify the dynamics of the system .",
    "very often the system is continuously monitored and the associated feedback scheme provides a continuous control of the quantum dynamics .",
    "an example is the measurement of an optical field mode , such as photodetection and homodyne measurements , and for these cases , wiseman and milburn have developed a quantum theory of continuous feedback @xcite . this theory has been applied in refs .",
    "@xcite to show that homodyne - mediated feedback can be used to slow down the decoherence of a schrdinger cat state in an optical cavity .    here",
    "we propose a different feedback scheme , based on direct photodection rather than homodyne detection .",
    "the idea is very simple : whenever the cavity looses a photon , a feedback loop supplies the cavity mode with another photon , through the injection of an appropriately prepared atom .",
    "this kind of feedback is naturally suggested by the quantum trajectory picture of a decaying cavity field @xcite , in which time evolution is driven by the non - unitary evolution operator @xmath1 interrupted at random times by an instantaneous jump describing the loss of a photon . the proposed feedback almost instantaneously `` cures '' the effect of a quantum jump and is able therefore to minimize the destructive effects of dissipation on the quantum state of the cavity mode .    in more general terms",
    ", the application of a feedback loop modifies the master equation of the system and therefore it is equivalent to an effective modification of the dissipative environment of the cavity field . for example , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that a squeezed bath @xcite can be simulated by the application of a feedback loop based on a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of a quadrature of a cavity mode . in other words , feedback is the main tool for realizing , in the optical domain , the so called `` quantum reservoir engineering '' @xcite .",
    "the master equation for continuous feedback has been derived by wiseman and milburn @xcite , and , in the case of perfect detection via a single loss source , is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cavity decay rate and @xmath4 is a generic superoperator describing the effect of the feedback atom on the cavity state @xmath5 .",
    "( [ feedeq ] ) assumes perfect detection , i.e. , all the photons leaving the cavity are absorbed by a unit - efficiency photodetector and trigger the cavity loop .",
    "it is practically impossible to realize such an ideal situation and therefore it is more realistic to generalize this feedback master equation to the situation where only a fraction @xmath6 of the photons leaking out of the cavity is actually detected and switches on the atomic injector .",
    "it is immediate to see that ( [ feedeq ] ) generalizes to @xmath7    now , we have to determine the action of the feedback atom on the cavity field @xmath4 ; this atom has to release exactly one photon in the cavity , possibly regardless of the field state in the cavity . in the optical domain",
    "this could be realized using _",
    "adiabatic transfer of zeeman coherence _",
    "@xcite .",
    "a scheme based on the adiabatic passage of an atom with zeeman substructure through overlapping cavity and laser fields has been proposed @xcite for the generation of linear superpositions of fock states in optical cavities .",
    "this technique allows for coherent superpositions of atomic ground state zeeman sublevels to be `` mapped '' directly onto coherent superpositions of cavity - mode number states .",
    "if one applies this scheme in the simplest case of a three - level @xmath9 atom one obtains just the feedback superoperator we are looking for , that is @xmath10 corresponding to the feedback atom releasing exactly one photon into the cavity , regardless the state of the field .    to see this ,",
    "let us consider a three level @xmath11 atom with two ground states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , coupled to the excited state @xmath14 via , respectively , a classical laser field @xmath15 of frequency @xmath16 , and a cavity field mode of frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath18 the time dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 is provided by the motion of the atom across the laser and cavity profiles .",
    "this hamiltonian couples only states within the three - dimensional manifold spanned by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes a fock state of the cavity mode . of particular interest within this manifold is the eigenstate corresponding to the adiabatic energy eigenvalue ( in the frame rotating at the frequency @xmath17 ) @xmath23 , @xmath24 now , according to the adiabatic theorem @xcite , when the evolution from time @xmath25 to time @xmath26 is sufficiently slow , a system starting from an eigenstate of @xmath27 will pass into the corresponding eigenstate of @xmath28 that derives from it by continuity .",
    "this means that if the atom crossing is such that adiabaticity is satisfied , when the atom enters the interaction region in the ground state @xmath12 , the following adiabatic transformation of the atom - cavity system state takes place @xmath29 roughly speaking , this transformation amounts to a single photon transfer from the classical laser field to the quantized cavity mode realized by the crossing atom , provided that a counterintuitive pulse sequence in which the classical laser field @xmath15 is time - delayed with respect to @xmath20 is applied .",
    "figure [ appa1 ] shows a simple diagram of the feedback scheme , together with the appropriate atomic configuration , cavity and laser field profiles needed for the adiabatic transformation considered .",
    "the quantitative conditions under which adiabaticity is satisfied are obtained from the requirement that the transition from the dark state @xmath30 to the other states be very small .",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cavity crossing time and @xmath33 are the two peak intensities .",
    "the above arguments completely neglect dissipative effects due to cavity losses and atomic spontaneous emission . for example",
    ", cavity dissipation couples a given manifold @xmath21 with those with a smaller number of photons . since ideal adiabatic transfer occurs when the passage involves a single manifold , optimization is obtained when the photon leakage through the cavity is negligible during the atomic crossing , that is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is mean number of photons in the cavity . on the contrary ,",
    "the technique of adiabatic passage is robust against the effects of spontaneous emission as , in principle , the excited atomic state @xmath36 is never populated .",
    "of course , in practice some fraction of the population does reach the excited state and hence large values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 relative to the spontaneous emission rate @xmath39 are desirable . to summarize , the quantitative conditions for a practical realization of the adiabatic transformation ( [ reali ] ) are @xmath40 which",
    ", as pointed out in @xcite , could be realized in optical cavity qed experiments .",
    "we note that when the adiabaticity conditions ( [ condi ] ) are satisfied , then also the markovian assumptions at the basis of the feedback master equation ( [ feedeq2 ] ) are automatically justified .",
    "in fact , the continuous feedback theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is a markovian theory derived assuming that the delay time associated to the feedback loop can be neglected with respect to the typical timescale of the cavity mode dynamics . in the present scheme",
    "the feedback delay time is due to the electronic trasmission time of the detection signal and , most importantly , by the interaction time @xmath41 of the atoms with the field , while the typical timescale of the cavity field dynamics is @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the inequality on the right of eq .",
    "( [ condi ] ) is essentially the condition for the validity of the markovian approximation and this _ a posteriori _ justifies our use of the markovian feedback master equation ( [ feedeq2 ] ) from the beginning .      when we insert the explicit expression ( [ adiafi ] ) of the feedback superoperator into eq .",
    "( [ feedeq2 ] ) , the feedback master equation can be rewritten in the more transparent form @xmath43 \\right ] \\label{sqroot}\\ ] ] that is , a standard vacuum bath master equation with effective damping coefficient @xmath44 plus an unconventional phase diffusion term , in which the photon number operator is replaced by its square root and which can be called `` square root of phase diffusion '' .    in the ideal case @xmath45 ,",
    "vacuum damping vanishes and only the unconventional phase diffusion survives . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is equivalent to say that ideal photodetection feedback is able to transform standard photodetection into a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of the photon number . in this ideal case , a generic fock state @xmath46",
    "is obviously preserved for an infinite time , since each photon lost by the cavity triggers the feedback loop which , in a negligible time , is able to give the photon back through adiabatic transfer . however , the photon injected by feedback has no phase relationship with the photons already present in the cavity and , as shown by ( [ sqroot ] ) , this results in phase diffusion .",
    "an alternative description of this phenomenon is that the photon injection process is essentially a nonlinear number amplifier which is necessarily accompanied by diffusion in the conjugate variable @xcite .",
    "this means that feedback does not guarantee perfect state protection for a generic _ superposition of number states _",
    ", even in the ideal condition @xmath47 .",
    "in fact in this case , only the diagonal matrix elements in the fock basis of the initial pure state are perfectly conserved , while the off - diagonal ones always decay to zero , ultimately leading to a phase - invariant state .",
    "however this does not mean that the proposed feedback scheme is good for preserving number states only , because the unconventional `` square - root of phase diffusion '' is much slower than the conventional one ( described by a double commutator with the number operator ) .",
    "in fact the time evolution of a generic density matrix element in the case of feedback with ideal photodetection @xmath47 is @xmath48 while the corresponding evolution in the presence of standard phase diffusion is @xmath49    since @xmath50 each off - diagonal matrix element decays slower in the square root case and this means that the feedback - induced unconventional phase diffusion is slower than the conventional one",
    ".    a semiclassical estimation of the diffusion constant can be obtained from the representation of the master equation in terms of the wigner function .",

( [ derise2 ] ) @xmath70 this slowing down of phase diffusion ( similar to that taking place in a laser well above threshold ) means that , when the feedback efficiency @xmath71 is not too low , the `` lifetime '' of generic pure quantum states of the cavity field can be significantly increased with respect to the standard case with no feedback ( see eq .",

    "photon states are known to retain their phase coherence over considerable distances and for long times and for this reason high - q optical cavities have been proposed as a promising example for the realization of simple quantum circuits for quantum information processing . to act as an information carrying quantum state",
    ", the electromagnetic fields must consist of a superposition of few distinguishable states .",
    "the most straightforward choice is to consider the superposition of the vacuum and the one photon state @xmath100 .",
    "however it is easy to understand that this is not convenient because any interaction coupling @xmath101 and @xmath102 also couples @xmath102 with states with more photons and this leads to information losses .",
    "moreover the vacuum state is not easy to observe because it can not be distinguished from a failed detection of the one photon state .",
    "a more convenient and natural choice is _ polarization coding _ , i.e. , using two degenerate polarized modes and qubits of the following form @xmath103 in which one photon is shared by the two modes @xcite .",
    "in fact this is a `` natural '' two - state system , in which the two basis states can be easily distinguished with polarization measurements ; moreover they can be easily transformed into each other using polarizers .",
    "polarization coding has been already employed in one of the few experimental realization of a quantum gate , the quantum phase gate realized at caltech @xcite .",
    "this experiment has demonstrated conditional quantum dynamics between two frequency - distinct fields in a high - finesse optical cavity .",
    "the implementation of this gate employs two single - photon pulses with frequency separation large compared to the individual bandwidth , and whose internal state is specified by the circular polarization basis as in ( [ twoqub ] ) .",

    "we have shown that the proposed feedback scheme is able to increase the `` lifetime '' of linear superpositions of fock states .",
    "therefore it is quite natural to look if our scheme can be used to protect qubits like those of the caltech experiment , against the destructive effects of cavity damping . to be more specific , here we shall not be concerned with the protection of the quantum gate dynamics , but we shall focus on a simpler but still important problem : protecting an unknown input state for the longest possible time against decoherence . for this reason we shall not consider the two interacting fields , but a single frequency mode with a generic polarization , i.e. , a single qubit .",
    "we shall consider a class of initial states more general than those of eq .",

    "( [ twoqubgen ] ) , one has to consider a feedback loop as that of fig .  1 for each polarized mode .",
    "this can be done using polarization - sensitive detectors which electronically control the polarization of the classical laser field and the initial state of the injected atoms .",
    "in fact one has to release in the cavity a left or right circularly polarized photon depending on which detector has fired and this can be easily achieved when the @xmath106 and @xmath107 transitions are characterized by opposite angular momentum difference @xmath108 . in this case a left polarized photon , for example , is given back to the cavity with the adiabatic transition @xmath109 of fig .  1 , while the right polarized one is released into the cavity through the reversed adiabatic transition @xmath110 and the two possibilities are controlled by the polarization sensitive detectors .",
    "since the input state we seek to protect is unknown , the protection capabilities of the feedback scheme are better characterized by the minimum fidelity , i.e. , the fidelity of eq .",
    "( [ fido ] ) minimized over all possible initial states .",
    "this minimum fidelity can be easily evaluated by solving the master equation ( [ sqroot ] ) for each polarized mode and one gets the following expression @xmath111    in the absence of feedback ( @xmath83 ) , this expression becomes @xmath112 showing that in this case , the states most robust against cavity damping are those with the smallest number of photons , @xmath113 , i.e. , the states of the form of eq .",

    "it is very difficult to achieve these experimental conditions with the present technology , but our scheme could become very promising in the future .",
    "in the case of measurements of an optical field mode , such as photodetection and homodyne measurements , the system is _ continuously _ measured and in these cases applying a feedback loop can be quite effective in controlling the decoherence of an optical schrdinger cat .",

    "when the probe atom is detected in @xmath156 , the cavity mode state is projected into the even subspace and this is equivalent to say that the cavity has lost an _ odd _ number of photons .",
    "again , in the limit of enough closely spaced sequence of probe atoms , @xmath200 , the probability of loosing three or more photons is negligible and therefore finding the level @xmath156 means that one photon has exited the cavity .",
    "therefore , for achieving a good protection of the initial odd cat state , the feedback loop has to supply the superconducting cavity with a photon whenever the probe atom is detected in @xmath156 , while feedback must not act when the atom is detected in the @xmath154 state .",

    "this assumption is essentially equivalent to the markovian assumption made for the continuous photodetection feedback described above and it simplifies considerably the discussion .",
    "the operator @xmath205 describing the dissipative time evolution between two successive atom crossings can be obtained from the exact evolution of a cavity in a standard vacuum bath @xcite and it can be written as @xmath215 where @xmath216    if we now use the explicit expressions ( [ fb ] ) and ( [ disso ] ) , we get the general expression of the transformation @xmath217 of eq .",

    "this implies in particular that only even values of @xmath220 can be considered in ( [ mapoele ] ) , because one starts from an odd coherent state and the matrix elements with @xmath220 odd , being zero initially , remain zero at any subsequent time .",
    "to state it in other words , if the initial state has a definite parity , the dynamical evolution is such that the cavity mode state evolves within the two subspaces with given parity and the projection into the space with no definite parity always remains zero .",
    "we have already used this fact in eq .",
    "( [ fb ] ) where we have written @xmath221 , since , as showed by ( [ offre21 ] ) and ( [ offre22 ] ) , these two matrices are just the odd and even components of the density matrix .",
    "generally speaking , the parity of the cavity mode state plays such a fundamental role that our stroboscopic feedback scheme is able to protect only even and odd coherent states ( we have considered an initial odd cat state only , but the scheme can be simply adapted to the even case ) .",
    "in fact one could generalize the scheme described above and consider the generation of more general cat states .",
    "for example , one can consider generic phase shifts @xmath222 ( as it is done in @xcite ) and generic microwave pulses in the two cavities @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 depend on the intensity and phase of the microwave pulses in @xmath142 and @xmath143 and on the interaction time .",
    "this allows to generate a large class of linear superpositions of coherent states with different phases , but only in the case of cat states with a given parity our stroboscopic scheme can be implemented .",
    "in fact the essential condition for the stroboscopic protection scheme to be applied is the existence of relations like ( [ offre21 ] ) and ( [ offre22 ] ) in which the cavity mode states conditioned to the detection of the two atomic levels are expressed as projections into given , orthogonal subspaces . only in this case in fact , is it possible to correlate with no ambiguity one atomic detection with a state or property of the cavity mode and then consequently apply a feedback scheme .",
    "it is then easy to prove that the two microwave pulses in @xmath142 and @xmath143 and the dispersive interaction in @xmath137 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2at2 ] ) ) determine two projection operators only for the situation considered here , ( @xmath226 and two @xmath144 pulses ) and these projectors are just the projectors into the even and odd subspace .",

    "the coupling parameter @xmath236 is instead connected to the probability of releasing the photon within the high - q cavity .",
    "we have assumed that the feedback atoms come from an independent source just to have the possibility of varying their velocity and therefore the parameter @xmath237 .",
    "this probability of releasing the photon in the cavity is maximized when the sine term in ( [ fb ] ) is maximum , i.e. , when @xmath238 this resonance condition depends on the photon number @xmath22 which however is not determined in general and moreover decreases as time evolves ( when @xmath239 ) . in the case of the schrdinger cat state studied here , ( [ sqreso ] ) roughly corresponds to the condition @xmath240 and this explains why at small times the case @xmath241 gives a good result ( @xmath228 in the figures ) . at longer times",

    "( [ statio ] ) .    at first sight , the comparison between the curves in the presence of feedback , with @xmath255 remaining close to one , and that in absence of feedback , seems to suggest that the initial odd cat state can be preserved almost perfectly .",
    "however , this is an incorrect interpretation because the quantity @xmath255 gives only a partial information on the state of the radiation mode within the cavity : it is a measurement of its parity ( see eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) ) and fig .",
    "[ peef ] only shows that our feedback scheme is able to preserve almost perfectly the initial parity .",
    "perfect cat state `` freezing '' can be realized only in cavities with an infinite @xmath256 ; the proposed feedback scheme inevitably modifies the initial state , even in the ideal conditions of perfect detection efficiency @xmath47 and continuous feedback @xmath257 .",
    "in fact the stroboscopic feedback model shows the same behavior of the continuous feedback model discussed above for optical cavities , which ( when restricting to initial states with given parity ) represents its continuous measurement limit @xmath258 .",
    "it is characterized by phase diffusion , because the photon left in the cavity by the resonant atom has no phase relationship with those in the cavity .",
    "however this phase diffusion proves to be slower than the usual phase diffusion , so that also in this stroboscopic case , the protection of the initial cat state is extremely good .",

    "the state evolved in presence of feedback is almost indistinguishable from the initial one and the interference oscillations are still very visible .",
    "[ strobo1]b also shows that the unconventional , feedback - induced phase diffusion is actually very slow , since its effects are not yet visible after @xmath261 .",

    "[ strobo2 ] , where the wigner functions at this time , both in the presence ( a ) and in absence ( b ) of feedback are compared ( other parameter values are the same as in fig .  [ strobo1 ] ) .",
    "quantum coherence is quite visible in ( a ) , while it has completely disappeared in ( b ) ; however the state in the presence of feedback begins to distort with respect to the initial state , as the two peaks associated with the two coherent state become broader and more rounded due to phase diffusion .",
    "in this paper we have presented a way for protecting a generic initial quantum state of a radiation mode in a cavity against decoherence .",
    "the initial quantum state is not perfectly preserved for an infinite time ( this is possible only in a cavity with an infinite q ) ; nonetheless its quantum coherence properties can be preserved for a long time and the `` lifetime '' of the state significantly increased .",
    "the model presented here is a `` physical '' way to control decoherence based on feedback , that is , measuring the system and modify its dynamics according to the result of the measurement . in this sense",
    "it is very similar in spirit , to the proposals of refs .",
    "our approach is complementary to those based on quantum error correction codes @xcite , using software to deal with decoherence .",
    "the present feedback acts in a very simple way : one checks if the cavity has lost a photon , and when this happens , one gives the photon back through the injection of an appropriately prepared atom . in the case of a continuous monitoring of the system and in the ideal limit of unit detector efficiency , the model preserves perfectly the photon number distribution of the initial quantum state of the cavity .",
    "this is obtained at the price of introducing an unconventional phase diffusion , slower than the usual phase diffusion , ( see eqs .",
    "( [ sqroot ] ) and ( [ derise2 ] ) ) , that modifies the state at sufficiently long times . to be more specific",
    ", feedback protects very well the relative phase of the coefficients of the components of the initial state , generating at the same time the diffusion of the phase of the field .",
    "the above description of the feedback scheme explicitely considers all the experimental limitations ( non - unit efficiency of the detectors , comparison between the various timescales ) except one : here we have assumed that one has an extemely good control of the atomic injection and that it is possible to send _ exactly _ one atom at a time in the cavity .",
    "this is not experimentally possible at the moment : for example , in @xcite sending an `` atom '' explicitely means sending an atomic pulse with an average number @xmath262 , so that the probability of having two atoms simultaneously in the cavity is negligible",
    ". this fact makes the proposed feedback scheme much less effective ; in fact , this is essentially equivalent to have , in the stroboscopic case , an effective quantum efficiency @xmath263 , because one has a probability @xmath264 of having one probe atom and one feedback atom in each feedback loop . as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamics in the presence of feedback becomes hardly distinguishable from the standard dissipative evolution .",
    "in the continuous feedback scheme for optical cavities one has the feedback atomic beam only and the effective efficiency is @xmath265 . anyway in the optical case , the problem of having _ exactly _ one feedback atom at a time with certainty , could be overcome , at least in principle , replacing the beam of feedback atoms with a single fixed feedback atom , optically trapped by the cavity ( for a similar configuration , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the trapped atom must have the same @xmath8 configuration described in fig .  1 and the adiabatic photon transfer between the classical laser field and the quantized optical mode could be obtained with an appropriate shaping of the laser pulse @xmath15 .",
    "the possibility of simulating the adiabatic transfer with an appropriately designed laser pulse has been recently discussed by kimble and law @xcite in a proposal for the realization of a `` photon pistol '' , able to release exactly one photon on demand ( see also @xcite ) . in this case , the feedback loop would be simply activated by turning on the appropriately shaped laser pulse focused on the trapped atom . during the time interval between two photodetections , the atom has to remain in the `` ready '' state @xmath266 , which is decoupled from the cavity mode , and this could be obtained with an appropriate recycling process , driven , for example , by supplementary laser pulses @xcite .",
