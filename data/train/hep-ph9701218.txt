    "the investigation of exclusive nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons represents an important and complicated theoretical problem .",
    "in contrast to the exclusive semileptonic decays , where the weak current matrix elements between meson states are involved , nonleptonic decays require the evaluation of hadronic matrix elements of the local four - quark operators . to simplify the analysis it is usually assumed that the matrix element of the current - current weak interaction factorizes into the product of two single current matrix elements .",
    "thus the problem reduces to the calculation of the meson form factors , parametrizing the hadronic matrix elements of weak currents as in the case of semileptonic decays , and the meson decay constants , describing leptonic decays @xcite .",
    "this makes the factorization hypothesis to be a very appealing assumption .",
    "however , strong interaction effects , such as final state interactions , the rescattering of the final hadrons etc . , can violate this approximation @xcite .",
    "there are also some problems with the different renormalization point dependence of the initial and factorized amplitudes @xcite .",
    "thus factorization can not be considered as a universal approach to nonleptonic decays .",
    "there were several theoretical developments which can help to justify the factorization for certain nonleptonic decays of heavy mesons .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that factorization holds in the limit of large number of colours @xmath1 in qcd .",
    "the leading @xmath2 corrections to this limit have also been considered .",
    "moreover intuitive arguments justifying factorization for the energetic nonleptonic decays were given by bjorken @xcite on the basis of the so - called colour transparency .",
    "in these decays the final hadrons are produced in the form of point - like colour - singlet objects with a large relative momentum .",
    "and thus the hadronization of the decay products occurs after they are too far away for strongly interacting with each other , providing the possibility to avoid final state interactions .",
    "dugan and grinstein @xcite discussed the factorization hypothesis within the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "they proved that factorization holds for the decays of a heavy @xmath0 meson into a heavy @xmath3 meson and a light meson , where the light quarks , which hadronize into a light meson , are highly energetic and collinear .",
    "therefore we have a good theoretical background to expect that factorization can be applied to the consideration of energetic nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the branching ratios of the exclusive energetic nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons in the framework of the relativistic quark model on the basis of factorization .",
    "the heavy - to - heavy hadronic form factors , appearing in the factorized amplitudes , are constrained by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "our model explicitly satisfies all these constraints and allows the determination of the corrections in the inverse powers of the heavy quark masses up to the second order @xcite . in the quoted paper",
    "we have determined the isgur - wise function and the subleading form factors in the hole kinematical range accessible in @xmath4 transitions .",
    "we shall use these functions here to evolve @xmath4 transition form factors from the point of zero recoil of the final @xmath3 meson to the values of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a mass of the final light meson .",
    "the form factors of the heavy - to - light transitions have been calculated in our model at the point of maximum recoil of the final light meson using the expansion in inverse powers of the heavy @xmath7 quark mass from the initial @xmath0 meson and in inverse powers of the large ( @xmath8 ) recoil momentum of the final light meson @xcite .",
    "we have also determined the @xmath9 dependence of the form factors near this kinematical point .",
    "thus we can calculate the heavy - to - light form factors which are necessary for the determination of energetic nonleptonic decay amplitudes .",
    "this combination of the methods of heavy quark expansion and the relativistic quark model increases the reliability of our predictions .",
    "the comparison of the results with the available experimental data will be the test of factorization .",

    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the standard model @xmath0 decays are described by the effective hamiltonian , obtained by integrating out the heavy @xmath10-boson and top quark and applying the operator product expansion . for the case of @xmath11 transitions , @xmath12 \\cr & & + \\frac{g_f}{\\sqrt{2}}v_{ub}\\left[c_1(\\mu)o_1^{ub}+ c_2(\\mu)o_2^{ub}\\right ] + \\dots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 are the corresponding cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",

    "however , as it is shown in @xcite , in the case of the production of an energetic light meson or meson resonance it is posible to justify the factorization approximation and the right - hand side of ( [ factor ] ) is scale - independent",
    ". thus we limit our analysis of nonleptonic decays to consideration of decays with at least one energetic meson in the final state ( such as @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us additionally note that in writing eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) we discarded the contribution of the colour - octet currents which emerge after the fierz transformation of colour singlet operators ( [ o12 ] ) .",
    "clearly these currents violate factorization since they can not provide transitions to the vacuum state .",
    "we also neglected the so - called @xmath10-exchange and annihilation diagrams . in the limit @xmath31 they are connected by the fierz transformation and",
    "are doubly suppressed by the kinematic factor of order @xmath32 and then dynamicly by the decreasing form factor @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the coefficients ( [ amu ] ) have been calculated at @xmath15 in the leading logarithmic approximation @xcite as well as beyond the leading logarithmic approximation @xcite .",

    "the form factor @xmath48 is the linear combination @xmath49 and in order to cancel the poles at @xmath50 , it is necessary to require @xmath51 we calculate the corresponding form factors in the framework of the relativistic quark model .",

    " the quasipotential of quark - antiquark interaction  we have assumed that the effective interaction is the sum of the one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials .",
    "we have also assumed that the vector confining potential contains the pauli interaction .",
    "the quasipotential is defined by @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath61 is the gluon propagator ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the dirac matrices and spinors and @xmath64 .",

    "the explicit expression for the quasipotential with the account of relativistic corrections of order @xmath70 can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "all the parameters of our model like quark masses , parameters of linear confining potential @xmath71 and @xmath0 , mixing coefficient @xmath69 and anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment @xmath66 were fixed from the analysis of meson masses @xcite and radiative decays @xcite .",

    "the value of the mixing coefficient of vector and scalar confining potentials @xmath79 has been chosen from the consideration of the heavy quark expansion @xcite and meson radiative decays @xcite , which are very sensitive to the lorentz - structure of the confining potential : the resulting leading relativistic corrections coming from vector and scalar potentials have opposite signs for the radiative m1-decays @xcite .",
    "finally the universal pauli interaction constant @xmath80 has been fixed from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath81- states @xcite .",
    "the meson wave functions in the rest frame have been calculated by numerical solution of the quasipotential equation ( [ 1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is more convenient to use analytical expressions for meson wave functions .",
    "the examination of numerical results for the ground state wave functions of mesons containing at least one light quark has shown that they can be well approximated in the meson rest frame by the gaussian functions @xmath82 with the deviation less than 5% .",
    "the parameters are    @xmath83    the matrix element of the local current @xmath38 between bound states in the quasipotential method has the form @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the initial ( final ) meson , @xmath86 is the two - particle vertex function and @xmath87 are the meson wave functions projected onto the positive energy states of quarks and boosted to the moving reference frame .",
    "this relation is valid for the general structure of the current @xmath88 , where @xmath89 can be an arbitrary combination of dirac matrices .",
    "the contributions to @xmath90 come from figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "note that the contribution @xmath91 is the consequence of the projection onto the positive - energy states .",
    "the form of the relativistic corrections resulting from the vertex function @xmath91 is explicitly dependent on the lorentz - structure of @xmath92-interaction .",
    "the general structure of the current matrix element ( [ 8 ] ) is rather complicated , because it is necessary to integrate both with respect to @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath95-function in the expression for the vertex function @xmath96 permits to perform one of these integrations . as a result",
    "the contribution of @xmath96 to the current matrix element has the usual structure and can be calculated without any expansion , if the wave functions of initial and final meson are known .",
    "the situation with the contribution of @xmath91 is different . here instead of the @xmath95-function we have a complicated structure , containing the potential of the @xmath92-interaction in a meson .",
    "thus , in general case , we can not perform one of the integrations in the contribution of @xmath91 to the matrix element ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to use some additional considerations .",
    "the main idea is to expand the vertex function @xmath91 in such a way that it will be possible to use the quasipotential equation ( [ 1 ] ) in order to perform one of the integrations in the current matrix element ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the realization of such expansion differs for the cases of heavy - to - heavy ( @xmath97 ) and heavy - to - light ( @xmath98 ) transitions .",
    "in the case of the heavy - to - heavy ( @xmath97 ) meson decays we have two natural expansion parameters , which are the heavy quark masses ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) in the initial and final meson . the most convenient point for",
    "the expansion of vertex function @xmath91 in inverse powers of the heavy quark masses is the point of zero recoil of the final @xmath3 meson , where @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath91 contributes to the current matrix element at first order of the @xmath103 expansion .",
    "we limit our analysis to the consideration of the terms up to the second order . after the expansion we perform the integrations in the contribution of @xmath91 to the decay matrix element . as a result",
    "we get the expression for the current matrix element , which contains the ordinary mean values between meson wave functions and can be easily calculated numerically .",
    "the results of such calculation are given in comparison with the predictions of hqet @xcite in @xcite .",
    "our model satisfies all the constraints imposed on the form factors by heavy quark symmetries and allows the determination of the isgur - wise and subleading form factors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of form factors at leading order of the @xmath103 expansion is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xmath106 the isgur - wise function in our model is @xmath107 with the slope parameter @xmath108 , which is in accordance with the recent cleo ii measurement @xcite @xmath109 .    at the first order of the @xmath103 expansion",
    "four additional independent form factors arise in hqet @xcite .",
    "we have determined these subleading form factors in the framework of our model @xcite @xmath110 where the hqet parameter @xmath111 in our model is equal to the mean value of the light quark energy in the heavy meson @xmath112 gev .",
    "we have also calculated the second order power corrections at the point of zero recoil of the final meson @xcite .",
    "the obtained structure of the second order corrections is in accord with predictions of hqet @xcite . as a result we got the values of the @xmath97 transition form factors at @xmath113 up to the second order terms .",
    "the higher order terms of the @xmath103 expansion are negligibly small . however",
    ", for the consideration of the energetic nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons we need the form factor values at @xmath114 ( @xmath115 is a final light particle ) .",
    "thus it is necessary to evolve the form factors from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath118 range is not very wide ( from 1 to @xmath119 ) .",
    "for such @xmath118 values the form factors are dominated by the isgur - wise function @xcite .",
    "some small contributions may arise from subleading form factors .",
    "the higher order terms give very small corrections @xcite .",
    "therefore we combine the universal isgur - wise @xmath9 dependence of form factors ( [ hffq ] ) with the subleading symmetry breaking corrections ( [ fo ] ) .",
    "the resulting form factor @xmath118 dependence is shown in figs .",
    "the values of form factors at @xmath50 are @xmath120",
    "in the case of heavy - to - light decays the final meson contains only light quarks ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) .",
    "thus , in contrast to the heavy - to - heavy transitions , we can not expand matrix elements in inverse powers of the final quark mass .",
    "the expansion of @xmath91 only in inverse powers of the initial heavy quark mass at @xmath101 does not solve the problem .",
    "however , the final light meson has the large recoil momentum , in comparison with its mass , almost in the whole kinematical range . at the point of maximum",
    "recoil of the final light meson the large value of recoil momentum @xmath124 allows for the expansion of decay matrix element in @xmath125 .",
    "the contributions to this expansion come both from the inverse powers of heavy @xmath99 from the initial @xmath0 meson and from inverse powers of the recoil momentum @xmath126 of the final light @xmath127 meson . in ref.@xcite",
    "we carried out this expansion up to the second order and performed one of the integrations in the current matrix element ( [ 8 ] ) using the quasipotential equation as in the case of a heavy final meson .",
    "as a result we again get the expression for the current matrix element , which contains only the ordinary mean values between meson wave functions , but in this case at the point of maximum recoil of the final light meson .",
    "the found values of @xmath121 form factors at the point of maximum recoil ( @xmath50 ) are @xmath128    the @xmath9 behaviour of the heavy - to - light form factors near @xmath126 ( corresponding to @xmath129 ) is given by @xcite @xmath130 where we have introduced the function @xcite @xmath131 @xmath132 equation ( [ xi ] ) reduces to the isgur - wise function ( [ iw ] ) in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks in the initial and final mesons .",
    "it is important to note that the form factors @xmath133 and @xmath134 in ( [ 48 ] ) , ( [ 46 ] ) have a different @xmath9 dependence than the other form factors ( [ 47 ] ) , ( [ 49 ] ) , ( [ 50 ] ) . in quark models",
    "one usually assumes a pole @xcite or exponential @xcite @xmath9 behaviour for all form factors .",
    "however , the recent qcd sum rule analysis indicates that the form factor @xmath133 has a @xmath9 dependence which is different from other form factors @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation of the @xmath9 dependence ( [ 46])-([50 ] ) to all values of @xmath9 ( or @xmath118 ) , accessible in @xmath98 transitions , introduces rather large uncertainties , because @xmath118 varies in a broad kinematical range ( from 1 to @xmath135 in @xmath136 and from 1 to @xmath137 in @xmath138 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath118 values for @xmath121 form factors which are really necessary for the consideration of energetic nonleptonic decays are limited to a rather small interval near @xmath139 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus , the application of formulas ( [ 46])-([50 ] ) in this region is rather reliable .",
    "we show the @xmath118 dependence of @xmath98 decay form factors in figs .",
    "in the factorization approximation one can distinguish three classes of @xmath0 meson nonleptonic decays ( see fig .",
    "6 ) @xcite : the ` class i ' transitions , such as @xmath140 , where only the term with @xmath141 in ( [ factor ] ) contributes ( i.e. both mesons are produced by charged currents ) ; ` class ii ' transitions , such as @xmath142 , where only the term with @xmath37 in ( [ factor ] ) contributes ( i.e. both mesons are produced by neutral currents ) and ` class iii ' transitions , such as @xmath143 , where both terms can contribute coherently .",
    "the results of the calculation of the nonleptonic branching ratios for @xmath97 and @xmath98 transitions are given in tables  1 and 2 in comparison with other model predictions @xcite-@xcite and experimental data .",
    "the @xmath144 decay branching ratios are presented for completeness .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that our results for the ` class i ' nonleptonic @xmath145 decays are close to the improved bsw model predictions @xcite , while our results for the ` class ii ' and @xmath37 contributions to ` class iii ' decays are smaller than those of @xcite .",
    "these contributions come from @xmath121 transition form factors , which have a different @xmath9 behaviour in our and the bsw models .",
    "the bsw model assumes universal @xmath9 dependence of all @xmath121 form factors .",
    "as already mentioned in our model we find the @xmath133 and @xmath134 form factors to have a different @xmath9 dependence than that of the other form factors ( see ( [ 46])-([50 ] ) and figs .",
    "the form factor @xmath134 in our model decreases with the growing of @xmath9 ( decreasing of @xmath118 ) in the kinematical range of interest for energetic nonleptonic decays ( see fig .  4 ) . note that our value for @xmath136 form factors at @xmath50 is approximately 1.5 times less than that of bsw , while the values for @xmath146 form factors are close in both models .",
    "our predictions for the branching ratios of @xmath147 nonleptonic decays presented in table  1 agree with experimental data within errors .",
    "thus we can conclude that factorization works rather well for ` class i ' and ` class iii ' decays @xmath29 .",
    "however , an improvement of experimental accuracy is needed to make a definite conclusion .",
    "it will be very interesting to measure the ` class ii ' decay @xmath148 branching ratios",
    ". such measurement will be the test of factorization for ` class ii ' nonleptonic decays and will help to constrain the @xmath118 ( or @xmath9 ) dependence of @xmath121 form factors .",
    "we also present in table  1 the predictions for @xmath149 nonleptonic decays , where only heavy mesons are present in the final state .",
    "the factorization is less justified for such decays .",
    "however , as we see from table  1 our predictions , based on the factorization , are consistent with the experimental data for these decays too .",
    "for the branching ratios of @xmath150 nonleptonic decays presented in table  2 there are only experimental upper limits at present . the measurement of these decays will allow the determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath151 , which is poorly studied .",
    "the closest experimental upper limit to the theoretical predictions is for the decay @xmath152 .",
    "it is approximately two times larger than our prediction and is very close to the result of @xcite . from this upper limit on @xmath153",
    "we get the limit on @xmath151 in our model @xmath154 which is close to the value previously found from semileptonic @xmath155 decays @xcite : @xmath156",
    "in this paper we have calculated the branching ratios of the energetic exclusive nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons on the basis of the factorization approximation . in particular the form factors of @xmath157 and @xmath121 transitions",
    "have been evaluated using the relativistic quark model and the heavy quark expansion .",
    "such expansion has been carried out up to the second order in the heavy quark masses .",
    "finally the momentum dependence of leading and subleading terms of this expansion has been used for the determination of the heavy - to - heavy transition form factors at @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is a final light meson .",
    "the overall agreement of our predictions for two - body nonleptonic decays of @xmath0 mesons with the existing experimental data @xcite shows that the factorization approximation works sufficiently well in the framework of our model . from another side ,",
    "if the factorization hypothesis is taken for granted , the aforementioned agreement confirms the selfconsistency of our approach , which incorporates our previously obtained results for semileptonic and leptonic decays of heavy mesons . in particular it would be quite intersting to test the specific @xmath9 behaviour of the heavy - to - light transition form factors @xmath134 and @xmath133 predicted by our model .",
    "another important problem is the determination of the coefficients @xmath141 and @xmath37 via @xmath160 and @xmath161 directly from qcd . as it has been discussed already in sec .  2 their values found in ref .",
    "@xcite are close to those obtained from fitting experimental data , though one should mention that @xmath161 is rather unstable with respect to the renormalization scheme and scale .",
    "nevertheless that means from our point of view that the factorization hypothesis for energetic @xmath0 meson decays has more or less firm grounds within qcd , at least for the ` class i ' decays .",
    "the situation is essentially different for @xmath3 meson nonleptonic decays . in this case",
    "the best fit to the experimental data yields @xmath162 and @xmath163 @xcite . meanwhile qcd predicts @xcite ( the instability of the coefficient here is even stronger ) @xmath164 and @xmath165 , which can only be consistent with the result of fitting data if one drops the @xmath2 terms in eq .",
    "( [ amu ] ) and puts @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "clearly , such an assumption would give a completely wrong result for @xmath0 decays , namely a negative sign of @xmath37 , which is ruled out by the experimental data .",
    "this result could indicate that the factorization approach in @xmath3 decays is insufficient and non - factorizable contributions there are large . in other words",
    "the @xmath3 meson is possibly not heavy enough compared to the @xmath0 meson . the results of refs .",
    "@xcite seem to point in the same direction .",
    "the successful description of nonleptonic two - body decays of @xmath0 mesons makes the present approach appealing for the further consideration of @xmath168 meson decays . work in this direction",
