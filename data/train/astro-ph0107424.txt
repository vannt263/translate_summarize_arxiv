    "these profiles are in conflict with the observations : rotation curves of late - type dwarf and lsb galaxies ( dm dominated galaxies ) seem to rule out singular halo profiles and are in good agreement with density profiles characterized by soft cores , central regions with constant density ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) . on the other hand , van den bosch & swaters ( 2001 )",
