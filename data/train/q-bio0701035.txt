    "<S> as shown in  @xcite , a large fraction of the non - self - regulatory links of the _ e. coli _ transcription network likely originated from duplication events . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , many pairs of tgs from the same homology class are regulated by a common tf ; likewise , many homologous tfs regulate the same tgs , and many pairs of tfs from the same homology class regulate homologous pairs of tgs . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the likely duplication events underlying this transcription network expansion conserve the number of tfs upstream of each target , hence leaving the layer hierarchy untouched . </S>",
    "<S> the only duplication event that can actually add a layer is the duplication of an ar , provided that a crosstalk is conserved . a comparison of the homology classes with the populations of the network layers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ardupl]b , table  [ tab : tables]b , supplementary table  s5.1a , and supplementary note  s2 ) , shows that globally genes of the same homology class tend to populate the same layer .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find only 5 non - self - regulatory links within homology classes ( see supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2.7 ) and they all involve at least one ar , suggesting that they originated from duplication events of an ar . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the histone - like autoregulator h - ns , belonging to layer 2 , regulates its homolog stpa , which belongs to layer 3 ( supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2.7 ) . yet </S>",
    "<S> , the coincidence between the number of non - self - regulatory links within homology classes and the number of hierarchical layers in _ e. coli _ , does not allow to conclude that the layers were generated by ar duplication events . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for some presumed rewiring of regulatory links also exists . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the same ar h - ns ( supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2.7 ) is also regulated by the cold shock protein cspa , which neither regulates any homologs of h - ns , nor has any homolog itself in the dataset . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus likely that this incoming regulatory link of h - ns does not come from duplication , but rather , from rewiring . </S>",
    "<S> thus rewiring could also be a mechanism for creation of new computational layers . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find also indications that _ de novo _ rewiring of regulatory links is limited by the network hierarchy . with respect to randomized instances , </S>",
    "<S> there is smaller dispersion of tg homology classes over multiple layers of computation than observed for tf homology classes . </S>",
    "<S> this can be quantified for example by the z - score of the number of gene pairs in the same layer and class ; the higher this quantity , the more duplication dominates on rewiring . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath20 for layer one ( entirely made of tfs ) , while @xmath21 for layer two ( dominated by tgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with an evolutionary scenario leading to an early structuration of the transcriptional network into a few hierarchical layers of computation ( from duplication of ars and limited rewiring as well ) followed by a primarily lateral expansion of tgs ( mostly by duplication ) .    altogether , these observations lead us to conclude that maintaining a `` shallow '' layer structure , where most of the computation is performed at the single layer level , seems to be important for the _ e.  coli _ transcription network . </S>",
    "<S> a possible rationale for this fact is that the time taken by a computational cascade involving multiple layers is expected to be roughly proportional to the number of layers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , since the network has to react to a particular stimulus or environment by `` switching on '' the proper genes without unnecessary delays , having many layers might be disadvantageous . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , it could be interesting to target studies to the sub - systems that make use of multi - layer computation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fback]d ) .     </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : tables ]    [ [ horizontal - gene - transfer . ] ] horizontal gene transfer .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us focus on horizontal gene transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the role of transferred genes with respect to their position in the network and in the homology classes ( table  [ tab : tables]c , supplementary table  s5.1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we used lists of genes likely to be transferred in _ e.  coli _ from ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these lists were obtained by a phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on 51 bacterial species . with a gain / loss penalty of two , @xmath22 of the genes in the network </S>",
    "<S> are classified as gene gains . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the gene gains are target genes . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with a simple binomial null model shows that most tfs are not likely to have been horizontally transferred , while transferred tgs are abundant . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one can conclude that in analogy with _ </S>",
    "<S> e.  coli _ metabolic network  @xcite , imported genes are mainly found at the `` periphery '' of the network . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , transferred tgs are not found in large homology classes , defining instead mostly single - gene classes , suggesting that gene duplications preceded many horizontal gene transfers . </S>",
    "<S> overall , this is consistent with a view of prokaryote evolution based on ancient duplications and conservation of a `` stable genetic core '' despite widespread horizontal gene transfers  @xcite .    0.5 cm    in conclusion , our findings confirm the importance of ( probably ancient ) duplications for the evolution of this network , and pinpoint to some important trends due to selective pressure and evolutionary dynamics , namely , preservation of ars and cancellation of crosstalks , as well as a propensity for a feedforward structure with a small number of computational layers . </S>",
    "<S> the layered hierarchy of _ e. coli _ transcription network appears to have first emerged and laterally expanded from duplication of a few ars . </S>",
    "<S> overall , this supports an evolutionary scenario based on duplication  @xcite ( with duplicates occupying the same layer ) and selective deletion of crosstalks between autoregulators ( which would otherwise increase the number of hierarchical layers ) . </S>",
    "<S> further duplication - driven lateral expansions of tg homology classes have then taken place together with widespread horizontal gene transfers of new tgs . </S>"
