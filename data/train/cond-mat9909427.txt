    "statistical behavior of the foreign exchange ( fx ) markets and price fluctuations in currency have been the subject of studies in recent years @xcite , @xcite . the high - frequency data for financial markets has made it possible to investigate market dynamics on timescales as short as 1 min , a value close to the minimum time needed to perform transaction in the market .",
    "it was observed that the short - term price fluctuations in fx market , for example , between us dollar and german mark , has the same statistical behavior as the velocity differences in hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .",
    "probability distributions in turbulence well fit the experimental data by superposition of the gaussians with log - normal distributions of its variances @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the convergence of the velocity differences distributions toward a gaussian shape corresponds to a decrease of the log - normal variance for increasing of spatial distances @xmath0 . in the fx fluctuation dynamics",
    "the statistical distributions of the price difference separated by time @xmath1 was elaborated by the theoretical model of a levy walk or levy flight @xcite,@xcite .",
    "i have developed a new stochastic dynamic theory for the fx market .",
    "the langevin type stochastic differential equation is proposed .",
    "i introduce the random force with some general characteristics in order to fit the theoretical predictions of my model with observed statistical dependencies .",
    "it is shown that the developed model describes exactly the ",
    "experimental  data of the dynamics of a price index of the new york stock exchange .",
    "the probability distributions of the standard & poor s 500 index differences @xmath2 are reproduced exactly by the @xmath3 .",
    "the new model describes well the scaling behavior of the  probability of return  @xmath4 as a function of @xmath1 ( for definitions , see @xcite ) .",
    "we will describe the dynamics of the fx price @xmath5 by the stochastic differential equation    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the random force .",
    "the quantity which were interested about is the price differences separated by the time scale @xmath1 ,    @xmath8    the distribution function of stochastic process @xmath9 is defined as follow    @xmath10    where ... means the averaging over the all possible realizations of the random force @xmath7 .",
    "let us construct the general stochastic force @xmath7 by the following way    @xmath11    here @xmath12 are the random amplitudes , @xmath13 is the response function , @xmath14 are the homogeneously distributed ( on time interval @xmath15 $ ] ) moments of time , the number @xmath16 of which obeys the poisson law .",
    "thus , the averaging includes three statistically independent averaging procedures :    \\1 . averaging over random amplitudes",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath17 ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the probability distribution of amplitudes @xmath12 .    \\2 . averaging over @xmath14 on time interval @xmath20 ,    @xmath21    \\3 . averaging over random numbers @xmath16 of time moments @xmath14 ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the density of points @xmath14 on time interval @xmath20 .    taking into account the definition eq.([eq3 ] ) and performing the averaging in accordance with eqs.([eq5])-([eq7 ] ) we will have    @xmath25    where we put notation    @xmath26    for simplicity the eq.([eq8 ] ) is considered for the market currency situation when @xmath19 is factorized as follow    @xmath27    where the gaussian distribution @xmath28 is given by    @xmath29    we also choose the response function in the form    @xmath30    the response function describes the influence of a piece of information which has become available at the delay time @xmath31 on the decision of a trader to propose or accept a price change .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is the character scale of the time delay .",
    "we also have considered the response function in the form    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a new parameter .",
    "for example , for @xmath35 we have    @xmath36    where    @xmath37    thus , we derive the new @xmath3 distribution ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) ) starting from the differential stochastic equation eq.([eq1 ] ) .    as it was mentioned the levy stable distribution",
    "is widely applied to this problem .",
    "the comparison between @xmath3 transformed to the form    @xmath38    @xmath39    the levy stable distribution @xcite , @xcite , @xcite    @xmath40    and the gauss distribution    @xmath41    is shown in fig.1 .",
    "figure 2 is a comparison of scaling properties of @xmath42 , and @xmath43    it is interesting that the _ laskin _ stochastic dynamics and phenomenological approach based on the _ levy _ distribution give the same scaling for the probability of return @xmath4 of the s&p 500 index variations as a function of the @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the developed theory is to predict the behavior of currency exchange market in the future and based on these prediction to develop the efficient currency market strategy .    as we will see",
    "further it is useful to generalize the eqs.([eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) in following way    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a  price dissipative coefficient  the financial mean of which will be discussed further .",
    "let us define the new pdf @xmath46 as follow    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the formal solution of the eq.([eq19 ] ) . and    @xmath49    using the eqs.([eq19 ] ) , ( [ eq20 ] ) it is easy to obtain the evolution equation for pdf @xmath46    @xmath50    @xmath51    the initial condition for this equation has the form    @xmath52    the eq.([eq21 ] ) , ( [ eq22])will serve as the main equations to predict the behavior of fx market in the future .",
    "it is easy to see that the solution of the problem eqs.([eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) can be written as    @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is characteristic function of the random amplitude @xmath56 .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the pdf @xmath28 and characteristic function @xmath55 are connected each other    @xmath57    and    @xmath58    the eqs.([eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) allow one to study the evolution problems in fx currency market .",
    "some analytically solvable evolution problems will be demonstrated in the next publication .",
    "the new dynamic stochastic theory of fx currency market dynamics is developed .",
    "we have established the new _ laskin _ distribution which well describes the observed statistical dependencies of the price difference separated by time scale @xmath1 and the _ laskin _ pdf which allows elaborate evolution of the currency market and predict behavior of market dynamics .",
    "the theoretical predictions based on the _ laskin _ distribution are compared with phenomenological the _ levy _ distribution based approach and observed statistical dependencies .",
    "it is interesting that the _ laskin _ stochastic dynamics and phenomenological approach based on the _ levy _ distribution give the same statistical and scaling dependencies",
