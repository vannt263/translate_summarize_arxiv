    "classical elasticity is a continuum theory that deals with the large scale deformation properties of solid systems .",
    "it relates stresses and strains by introducing a host of phenomenological parameters , e.g. shear and bulk modulus for isotropic media , that characterize the elastic properties on wave lengths large compared with any other material length scale  @xcite .",
    "biological systems like the cell or sub - cellular organelles are often characterized by a highly heterogeneous structure with a multitude of hierarchical levels of organization  @xcite . due to these large scale inhomogeneities",
    "that may extend up to the scale of the system size , the applicability of elasticity theory on smaller length scales has to be critically examined .",
    "in particular , the actual deformations in the system are expected to relate to the externally applied stresses in a non - trivial way that crucially depends on the specific structural details .    to shed some light on the relevance of structure to the effective elasticity this article deals with the calculation of elastic constants in networks of semi - flexible polymers . in eukaryotic cells these networks",
    "assemble to form the cytoskeleton that plays a central role in many cellular functions such as locomotion , adhesion or cell division .",
    "from the point of view of structure already a one - component isotropic solution of semi - flexible polymers represents an interesting model - system being studied for many years  @xcite .",
    "one of the main quantities of interest is the plateau value of the shear modulus found at intermediate timescales where single polymer bending fluctuations are equilibrated , yet center of mass motion is negligible .",
    "the generally accepted theory for the concentration dependence of the plateau modulus is based on the free energy change of confining a polymer to a tube  @xcite , the diameter of which is a consequence of the structural organization of the tubes in the form of a random assembly of cylinders  @xcite . even though this is well known for more than a decade , computer simulations to study the geometrical as well as elastic properties in this fibrous architecture have only recently been realized  @xcite .    upon the addition of cross - linking agents or other",
    "regulating proteins one can induce structural changes to modify the network architecture in many ways  @xcite .",
    "there have been attempts to describe the phase - diagram of these systems  @xcite , the detailed mechanisms that lead to a particular structure , however , are far from being understood . in general",
    ", there will be a complex interplay of polymer kinetics , thermal fluctuations and chemical as well as mechanical properties of the polymers and the cross - linking agents yielding a particular architecture relevant for a given physical situation .",
    "a complementary approach to describe cross - linked networks is to neglect these intricate `` dynamic '' aspects of the network , and to concentrate on a `` static '' architecture and its effect on the macroscopic elasticity  @xcite . in the structural engineering community , for example",
    ", it is of tantamount importance to analyze the architecture of structures made of beams or trusses . a common way to take advantage of the reduced weight compared to the bulk material without suffering from a loss of stiffness",
    "is a triangulation of the basic cells .",
    "this eliminates the soft bending modes of the beams and makes it possible to construct huge cantilever bridges like that over the firth of forth in scotland or towers like eiffel s tower in paris .",
    "since the rigidity of these structures is not due to the individual beam but to a non - local back - coupling effect induced by the architecture of the network , the triangulation is therefore one example on how cooperativity among the building blocks may be possible .    to address this question of cooperativity in the context of the elasticity of cross - linked stiff polymer networks",
    "we will concentrate in the following on two generic structures , _ cellular _ and _ fibrous _ networks , that may serve as reference systems for the classification of real polymer networks . while cellular structures may be characterized by the amount of randomness in size and type of their unit cells ( see fig.[fig : vornet]b - d ) , fibrous networks have a hierarchical structure , where smaller cells are generated within lager cells within even larger cells ( fig.[fig : vornet]a ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the presence of the additional mesoscopic scale of the fiber length .",
    "as we will see , this length - scale is ultimately responsible for the intricate scaling properties of the elasticity of fibrous polymer networks .",
    "the goal of this article is to identify these mechanisms , that couple the particular network structure to the properties of the individual polymers and effectuate the macroscopic elasticity of the system .",
    "in contrast to the purely mechanical systems relevant for engineering applications  @xcite , the systems we would like to study are immersed in a thermal environment .",
    "this implies that in addition to the usual enthalpic polymer elasticity also entropic effects have to be accounted for .",
    "we have published a brief account of this study recently  @xcite .",
    "it will turn out that by accounting for the entropic origin of the single - polymer elasticity , the networks acquire a strong susceptibility to polydispersity and structural randomness that is completely absent in athermal models .",
    "illustration of the different architectures of ( a ) fibrous and ( b - d ) cellular materials in two dimensions . while ( a ) and ( b ) are random structures generated by poisson point processes , ( c ) and ( d ) are quite regular networks based on honeycomb and square lattices , respectively . ]    the article is organized as follows .",
    "in sect.[sec : model - definition ] we motivate our modeling approach of thermally fluctuating networks of stiff polymers .",
    "this will lead us to the definition of effective elastic properties of the `` polymer segments '' that constitute the elementary building blocks of the network . in sect.[sec : cell - arch ] and [ sec : fibrous - architecture ] these polymer segments are assembled into cellular and fibrous networks , respectively .",
    "the macroscopic elastic constants of these structures are calculated and related to the particular architectural features . finally , in sect.[sec : conclusion ] we present our main conclusions and hint at implications for experiments .",
    "to study the elastic properties of thermally fluctuating cross - linked stiff polymer networks we calculate numerically the low frequency shear modulus . assuming a time - scale separation between the fast bending fluctuations of the single polymer and their very slow center of mass motion",
    ", we adopt a description of the system in the spirit of a born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "this neglects entropic contributions from the `` slow variables '' , the cross - link positions , while assuming the `` fast '' polymer degrees of freedom to be equilibrated at all times .",
    "macroscopic quantities will then depend parametrically on the set of cross - link variables .",
    "a macroscopic shear strain @xmath0 constrains the cross - links at the boundaries , while those in the bulk are moving freely to minimize the elastic energy @xmath1 .",
    "the shear modulus is defined as its second derivative with respect to the shear strain , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the system volume .    by keeping the positions of the cross - links fixed",
    ", the energy can be written as a sum @xmath4 over contributions from individual polymer segments @xmath5 , each of which connects a given pair of cross - links ( see fig.[fig : modeling ] ) .",
    "the single segment energy @xmath6 depends on the generalized `` displacement - vector '' @xmath7 , which incorporates the degrees of freedom , displacements @xmath8 and rotations @xmath9 , of the two cross - links pertaining to the segment .    in the numerical section we focus on two - dimensional systems such that a vector @xmath10 has six components .",
    "those are in - plane displacements @xmath11 and z - axis rotations @xmath12 , at both ends @xmath13 of the segment with length @xmath14 ( see fig.[fig : modeling ] ) .",

    "the matrix elements are well established and relate to the two deformation modes of stretching ( s ) and bending ( @xmath23 ) , respectively .",

    "is used .    while we refer to appendix  [ sec : stiffness - matrix ] for a derivation of the complete matrix",
    ", it turns out that the response of a beam of length @xmath14 is sufficiently characterized already by two elements of @xmath21 , @xmath25 relating to either deformation mode . due to their small aspect ratios",
    "@xmath26 slender rods are highly anisotropic and much softer in bending than in stretching , @xmath27 . in this approximation",
    "the two deformation modes are decoupled such that , for example , pre - stretching does not influence the bending response .",
    "therefore , euler - buckling can not be accounted for .    here",
    ", we consider thermally fluctuating stiff polymers immersed in a heat bath of solvent molecules . in these systems",
    ", the effects of temperature on the elastic properties of the polymer can be quantified by defining the persistence length @xmath28 as the ratio of bending stiffness to thermal energy @xmath29 . with this definition",
    "we have , in addition to the enthalpic stiffness of the classical beam , an entropic contribution @xmath30 to the polymer s stretching compliance that can be calculated within the wormlike chain model  @xcite .",
    "the prefactor @xmath31 depends on the specific boundary conditions chosen at the ends of the polymer segment .",
    "its value can be absorbed in the persistence length , and therefore only quantitatively affects the results . to avoid a large numerical offset with respect to eq.([eq : kbeam ] ) , we have chosen @xmath32 , which corresponds to a boundary condition with one end clamped  @xcite . having two longitudinal deformation modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 the effective stretching stiffness is equivalent to a serial connection @xmath33    thus , the elastic properties of the polymer segments are given by the classical theory of beam bending supplemented by a generalized stretching stiffness , that also includes entropic effects .",
    "while the stiffness matrix has only been set up for the two - dimensional problem , the governing entries in three dimensions will still be the same eqs.([eq : kbeam ] ) and ( [ eq : k_entr ] ) .",
    "as one can infer from eqs.([eq : kbeam ] ) and ( [ eq : k_entr ] ) , at a given temperature @xmath34 there are two length scales characterizing the material properties of the polymers , the radius @xmath22 and the persistence length @xmath28 .",
    "typical biological polymers are characterized by a ratio @xmath35 .",
    "f - actin , for example , a key component of the cytoskeleton has @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , while microtubules , most important for cell - division and intra - cellular transport , have an even larger @xmath38 . for specificity , we require in the following a constant @xmath39 , the precise value , however , is irrelevant if one is interested only in the thermal response where the radius does not enter and @xmath40   and the youngs - modulus @xmath41 in such a way that the bending stiffness @xmath42 stays constant . as a consequence",
    "the stretching stiffness diverges , @xmath43 , and the beam becomes inextensible .",
    "occasionally , we will perform this limit to highlight features that are independent of the mechanical stretching response . on the other hand ,",
    "the location of the cross - over point , where the mechanical stretching becomes relevant , does indeed depend on the choice of @xmath44 . by definition",
    ", it determines the relative magnitude of the two stretching compliances @xmath45 .",
    "the dependence of the three force constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , eqs.([eq : kbeam ] ) and ( [ eq : k_entr ] ) , on the ratio of persistence length to segment length @xmath46 is illustrated in fig.[fig : forceconstants ] .",
    "one can clearly distinguish three regimes , in each of which one of the spring constants is by far smaller than the remaining two .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a hypothetical spring where the deformation modes are coupled in series @xmath47 .",
    "if the segment length @xmath14 was representative for the network under consideration , that is the network was characterized by only small polydispersity , then we would expect the macroscopic modulus to be well approximated by the microscopic single segment behavior considered here .",
    "we will later refer to this behavior as the `` affine model '' .",
    "it will be shown to be valid only in regular cellular structures .",
    "dependence of the three spring constants @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 on persistence length @xmath46 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a hypothetical spring with the three deformation modes connected in series . ]",
    "this completes the specification on the microscopic scale of the elastic properties of the single polymer segments .",
    "we now proceed to assemble the segments into networks of varying architecture to identify the physical principles which determine the elastic response on the macroscopic scale .",
    "to determine the elastic shear modulus , we apply a small shear strain of @xmath48 to stay in the regime of linear elasticity and use periodic boundary conditions on all four sides of the simulation box .",
    "the numerical procedure is performed with the commercially available finite element solver msc.marc .",
    "the results will be complemented by scaling arguments .",
    "we will find that in _ regular cellular architectures _",
    ", to be discussed next , macroscopic elasticity can trivially be explained by the microscopic constitutive laws given in terms of the stiffness matrix @xmath49 . in sufficiently _ random cellular systems _",
    ", however , this picture is changed .",
    "the macroscopic response takes up nontrivial features that can not be explained by single polymer elasticity . in _ fibrous architectures _ , subject of sect.[sec : fibrous - architecture ] , we will find this anomalous elasticity again but in more striking form .",
    "a cellular structure is most conveniently constructed from a voronoi tessellation of a distribution of points which may either be chosen regularly or by some random process  @xcite . with each point",
    "we associate a voronoi cell that is defined to enclose that region in space which is closer to the given point than to any of its neighbors .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to the wigner - seitz construction known from solid - state physics . in three dimensions",
    "the elastic elements are defined to be the lines of intersection of two neighboring cell walls , while in two dimensions ( see fig.[fig : vornet ] ) they are represented by the cell walls themselves .",
    "we will call these elastic building blocks of the network _",
    "polymer segments _ and associate to them the material properties , respectively the stiffness matrix @xmath21 , introduced in the preceding section . by its definition , a segment spans the distance between two vertices and is therefore `` end - linked '' to the rest of the network .",
    "depending on the spatial distribution of voronoi points there will also be a distribution @xmath50 of segment lengths @xmath51 . only in regular structures , for example the ( anisotropic ) two - dimensional honeycomb structure , this distribution will degenerate into one ( or several ) delta - function peaks .",
    "the first moment of this distribution , the average segment length @xmath52 , is naturally the most important quantity to describe the geometrical aspects of a cellular structure . in @xmath53 dimensions",
    "this `` mesh - size '' may be reparametrized in terms of the density @xmath54 as @xmath55 where we defined @xmath54 as the total polymer length per system size .",
    "while there are practical reasons to use @xmath54 as a measure for the density in the simulations , in experimental work it is sometimes easier to control the monomer concentration @xmath56 .",
    "this can be found as @xmath57 , where the cross - section radius @xmath22 is assumed proportional to the monomer size .      in the engineering literature",
    "the cellular structures defined above are well known as foams and are ubiquitous in nature and many areas of technology .",
    "examples range from liquid foams and froths well known from drinks or household detergents , to plastic and metallic foams used for insulation or shock absorption  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that naturally occurring foams have to obey plateau s laws to reach an equilibrium state .",
    "we do not require these laws to hold in the following , since we are interested in the dependence of elastic properties on the architectural features in general , and not in the specific details of the dynamic properties of foams .",
    "for purely mechanical cellular foams , where thermal fluctuations are neglected altogether , the only material length scale is the radius @xmath22 of the cross - section . by identifying @xmath58 as an energy scale",
    ", we can use dimensional analysis to write the shear modulus @xmath59 as @xmath60 where the occurrence of the spatial dimension @xmath61 highlights the fact that the modulus has units of an energy density . in writing this ,",
    "we have not made explicit the dependence on the higher moments of the probability distribution @xmath62 .",
    "as will become clear below , these can be used to characterize the randomness of the structure and will be considered separately .",
    "if one defines force - constants at the scale of the average mesh - size @xmath63 the scaling variable can alternatively be written as @xmath64 , and therefore characterizes the relative stiffness of the bending to the stretching mode .      restricting our attention for the moment to regular structures , macroscopic elasticity",
    "can already be understood by considering the response of a single cell  @xcite . in these systems",
    "it seems reasonable that local stresses acting on an individual cell are the same as those applied on the macroscopic scale . in other words ,",
    "the local deformation @xmath65 of a cell with linear dimension @xmath52 follows the macroscopic strain @xmath0 in an _ affine way _ such that it scales as @xmath66 . with this assumption",
    "the scaling function can be calculated  @xcite and one generically finds for the modulus @xmath67 where the details of the particular structure may enter the numbers @xmath68 and @xmath69 in an involved way .",
    "the important conclusion to be drawn is that the deformation modes act as if they were springs connected in series . for slender beams with @xmath70",
    "the bending mode is softer than the stretching mode and therefore dominates the modulus ",
    "mechanical foams are _ bending dominated_.    while we argue here that the modulus in eq.([eq : gfoam ] ) represents the generic case , there may be special cases were the prefactors @xmath68 or @xmath69 are suppressed by the specific choice of the unit cell .",
    "the triangulated network is one example where @xmath71 and the bending mode is suppressed .",
    "below we will encounter another example when studying the square lattice .",
    "for these systems the special geometry of the unit cell , or more generally , the local architecture has to be taken into account .",
    "this is indeed the main focus of this article . on the other hand , by assuming affine displacements no cooperativity between the elastic responses of neighboring cells is possible .",
    "the macroscopic modulus @xmath59 directly reflects the elastic properties of the single cell .",
    "the local geometry is being hidden in the prefactors @xmath68 and @xmath69 , while the effect of the assembled structure may simply be predicted by counting the numbers of cells .",
    "we have tested the validity of the affine model in a simple two - dimensional cellular structure with varying degree of randomness .",
    "we have taken the seeds for a voronoi construction of a regular , honeycomb lattice structure and randomly displaced them with a uniform probability distribution of width @xmath72 .",
    "the influence of randomness on the elastic properties of mechanical ( non - fluctuating ) foams has been studied extensively by various authors  @xcite . here , we also include effects from thermal fluctuations such that the response of a polymer segment is characterized by three deformation modes with stiffnesses @xmath73 and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "this has to be compared with the actual results of our numerical analysis in fig.[fig : vorhexmod ] .",

    "the curves correspond to varying degrees of randomness @xmath81 .",

    "inset : distribution @xmath62 of segment lengths for the same systems . at low levels of randomness ( @xmath82 )",
    "it can be approximated by a gaussian probability distribution ( dashed line ) , while it shows significant broadening upon increasing the randomness to @xmath83 .",
    "the peak disappears completely in the case of the maximally random poisson foam . ]",
    "we find that regular networks ( black curve , circles ) characterized by a single mesh - size @xmath52 indeed display the functional form expressed through eq.([eq : gthermfoam ] ) . for mesh - sizes",
    "much larger than the persistence length @xmath84 the network deforms by pulling out thermal undulations and @xmath85 ( left part of fig.[fig : vorhexmod ] ) . decreasing the mesh - size beyond @xmath86 stretching of the polymer backbone",
    "dominates the modulus @xmath87 ( right part of fig.[fig : vorhexmod ] ) .",
    "the physically relevant situation for studying stiff polymers , however , corresponds to the intermediate regime , where the persistence length is much larger than the mesh - size , which is still much larger than the polymer radius @xmath88 .",
    "typical actin networks with @xmath89 and @xmath90 may have mesh - sizes in the sub - micron range @xmath91 . in this regime ,",
    "most of the energy is stored in the bending modes leading to @xmath92 corresponding to the plateau region visible in fig.[fig : vorhexmod ] .    using the values @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 we managed to fit the scaling function of eq.([eq : gthermfoam ] ) to the numerical data ( in fact , this is the dashed line in fig.[fig : forceconstants ] ) .",
    "increasing the level of randomness the presence of the additional variable @xmath81 spoils the scaling property and a fit is no longer possible .",
    "the power law regimes gradually shrink and the cross - over regions increase in size . while the mechanical stretching regime is hardly affected by the randomness at all , this effect is most pronounced in the cross - over from the bending to the thermal stretching dominated regime .",
    "the physically most relevant intermediate plateau regime disappears completely and shows strong amplitude modulations .",
    "we have also generated foams by voronoi tessellation of a fully random distribution of points , corresponding to a poisson process ( blue curve , left triangles ) .",
    "for these `` maximally random foams '' one could rather use an expression @xmath96 to characterize the modulus at these intermediate parameter values . at this point",
    "this is only an empirical observation .",
    "later , in the context of the fibrous architecture , we will see how this exponent can be derived from a scaling argument that properly takes into account the randomness in the system .",
    "one may infer from the inset of fig.[fig : vorhexmod ] that deviations from the scaling form presented in eq.([eq : gthermfoam ] ) are indeed intimately connected to a broadening of the segment length distribution @xmath50 . in the regular structure the distribution can very well be described by a gaussian centered around the average mesh - size @xmath52 ( dashed line in fig.[fig : vorhexmod ] ) .",
    "random foams , on the contrary , display significantly broader distributions and even have non - negligible weight on very small segments .",
    "we will see below that the different effect of randomness in the thermal and the mechanical stretching regimes can be traced back to the unusually strong length dependence of the entropic stretching stiffness @xmath97 as compared to @xmath98 .",
    "we will find that this leads to the breakdown of the affine model whenever there is a sufficiently broad distribution of segment lengths .",
    "thermal networks are thus inherently more sensitive to elements of randomness than purely mechanical systems .",
    "it is instructive to consider yet another lattice structure as a basis for our foam model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vornet ] ) . by placing the voronoi points on a slightly randomized square lattice",
    "one can generate a foam with a bimodal segment length distribution having a second peak at some small length @xmath99 ( see inset fig.[fig : vorsquaremod ] ) . to understand this",
    ", one has to realize that a generic foam structure generated by voronoi tessellation has only three - fold connected vertices , while they are four - fold connected in the square network .",
    "a small amount of randomness therefore induces a bifurcation of a four - fold vertex into a short segment with three - fold connected vertices at its ends ( see fig.[fig : squareshear ] ) .    .",
    "]    unlike the honeycomb foam , the resulting structure is elastically anisotropic and has @xmath100 distinct moduli @xcite .",
    "in addition to the bulk modulus there are two shear moduli corresponding to simple and pure shear deformations .",
    "these two modes are schematized in fig.[fig : squareshear ] , while the corresponding moduli ( together with the isotropic shear modulus of the poisson foam ) are shown in fig.[fig : vorsquaremod ] .    ) as shown in fig.[fig : vornet ] . also shown is the modulus of the highly random poisson foam .",
    "inset : distribution of segment lengths for the same network .",
    "the dashed line is a fit to a sum of two gaussians centered around @xmath101 and @xmath102 . ]",
    "pure shear leads to deformations along the main axis of symmetry of the unit squares and thus to stretching of the elements .",
    "the bending regime is therefore strongly suppressed . on the other hand , simple shear deforms the squares along their diagonals and thus favors the bending mode .",
    "only when the stretching energy stored in the small segments @xmath103 equals the bending energy in the average segment @xmath104 does the system cross - over to a stretching dominated network .",
    "noting ( from the inset of fig.[fig : vorsquaremod ] ) that @xmath105 we find that this happens when @xmath106 in accord with fig.[fig : vorsquaremod ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that the network looses its anisotropy at the two points @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where the modulus takes the same value as that of the poisson foam .",
    "this follows from the fact that the stiffness of the average polymer segments is isotropic at these parameter values and either @xmath109 or @xmath110 . comparing absolute values",
    "we find that the shear modulus in the thermal regime , strongly influenced by the presence of the small segments , can vary orders of magnitude while the mechanical stretching regime is hardly affected at all .    to conclude this section we emphasize once again that polydispersity in the segment lengths can have strong effects on the macroscopic elasticity of a cellular polymer network .",
    "it can lead to modifications of the scaling properties , as we have found in the most random foams , as well as to quantitative changes of the modulus by several orders of magnitude as in the anisotropic square structure . as a consequence ,",
    "experiments which are limited to restricted parameter windows would most likely measure effective exponents that lie in between the extremal values given by pure stretching and bending .",
    "one , therefore , has to be cautious interpreting experimental data within the context of the foam - model , without the knowledge of the polydispersity of the structure .",
    "looking at pictures of cross - linked actin networks reconstituted in vitro  @xcite one might wonder whether a description in terms of a cellular architecture is actually relevant for these systems at all . besides having a strong polydispersity in cell sizes , real polymer networks seem to have a hierarchical architecture that allows for smaller cells to be generated within larger cells within even larger cells . on the contrary",
    ", foams only have one of these hierarchies ( see fig.[fig : vornet ] ) .",
    "what is more , cellular structures do not account for the effects of the polymer length @xmath111 , which constitutes an additional mesoscopic scale in the problem .    in the following we want to quantify the effects of the polydispersity in connection with the length scale @xmath111 by studying the elastic properties of a generic two - dimensional fibrous structure which is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath112 anisotropic elastic elements , geometrically represented by straight lines of length @xmath111 , are placed on a plane of area @xmath113 such that both position and orientation of the elements are uniformly random distributed .",
    "this randomness entails a distribution of angles @xmath114 $ ] between two intersecting filaments @xmath115 which has a maximum for filaments at right angles . at any intersection",
    "a permanent cross - link with zero extensibility is generated .",
    "this constrains the relative translational motion of the two filaments . for the rotational degree of freedom one may introduce an energy contribution @xmath116 for the change of relative cross - link angles @xmath117 from their initial values @xmath118 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the study of the two limiting cases , where the potential is either soft ( @xmath119 ) and therefore allows for free relative rotations of the filaments ( free hinges ) , or infinitely stiff ( @xmath120 ) and inhibits any change of the angles at the cross - links ( fixed angles ) .",

    "this implies that , in general , two neighboring segments on the same filament produce a net force @xmath182 at their common node that has to be taken up by the crossing filament .",
    "there , it leads to additional deformations that eventually destroy the affine order .",
    "this mechanism is illustrated in fig.[fig : mechanism ] where the relaxation of the small segment @xmath99 leads to bending of its neighbor on the crossing filament ( b ) .",
    "also the segment @xmath183 on the same filament is affected by the relaxation and experiences an additional stretching contribution ( a ) . whether the available energy is stored in the stretching or the bending mode depends crucially on the value of the persistence length , as is indicated in the figure .",

    "there are always residual forces high enough to cause additional deformation of the crossing filament .",
    "hence we conclude that an affine deformation field is unstable and that the system can easily lower its energy by redistributing the stresses to relieve shorter segments and remove the tails of the residual force distribution @xmath192 .    even though we have evaluated eq.([eq : resforce ] ) for the special case of an exponential segment length distribution eq.([eq : segdist ] ) , it is important to note , that the observed sensitivity is not a special feature of the fibrous architecture , but applies to any polymer network with a broad distribution of segment lengths independent of the dimensionality of the network . due to the strong length dependence of @xmath193",
    "the thermal response is highly sensitive to even small polydispersity as we have already seen in the random cellular network of sect.[sec : cell - polydispersity ] . on the contrary ,",
    "these effects are completely absent in purely mechanical models and also in models of flexible polymers , where the distribution @xmath192 degenerates into a delta - function peak at the value @xmath194 , and explains the robustness of these regimes to randomness .    if we want to include the effects of randomness into a microscopic theory we can not naively apply the conventional picture of affine deformations on the scale of the single segment .",
    "this can safely be done only in highly ordered structures like regular cellular materials .",
    "instead , we have to adopt a description of the deformations ( at least ) on the larger scale of the complete polymer . in the following we therefore consider a _",
    "typical polymer filament _ , which is composed of a sequence of segments drawn from the distribution @xmath50 . to describe the elastic properties correctly",
    ", we will also have to consider the connections of the polymer to the surrounding network matrix , in addition to the elastic properties of the segments themselves .",
    "we may now employ this picture to explain the intricate scaling properties of the polymer network in all the parameter regimes displayed in fig.[fig : modulusscaled ] .",
    "we start with the description of the system in the parameter region @xmath131 ( @xmath177 ) , where the properties of the cross - links strongly influence the system s response .",
    "the idea is to impose a virtual affine deformation on every segment and calculate , as a perturbative correction , the contribution to the elastic energy resulting from the relaxation out of this reference state .",
    "this procedure will lead to good predictions only when the corrections are small and the affine deformations are only weakly perturbed . as we will see below ,",
    "this is the case in the parameter region @xmath131 .",
    "however , it will also become clear , that a small perturbation for the deformations is sufficient to generate completely different scaling properties for the macroscopic modulus . for the moment",
    "we restrict our attention to free relative cross - link rotations ( branch @xmath133 ) , since then the affine reference state is particularly simple and contains stretching contributions only .",
    "as explained above any deviation from the affine reference state , induced by relaxation of non - zero residual forces , will lead to additional deformations in the crossing filaments .",
    "since it is more likely that two filaments cross each other at an angle close to @xmath195 , the induced non - affine deformations will mainly be oriented transverse to the contour of the crossing filament and are therefore of bending character .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath156 supports this assumption and indicates that bending and stretching deformations in this regime contribute equally to the elastic energy even though the bending mode is very stiff ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "therefore any relaxation of residual stretching forces , will be punished by high amounts of bending energy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mechanism]b ) .",
    "only the smallest segments on the polymer , corresponding to the outermost tails of the residual force distribution , will have sufficient energy to perturb the deformation field and relax to a state of lower strain .    in the following",
    ", we will assume that segments up to a critical length @xmath197  to be determined self - consistently  fully relax from their affine reference state to give all their energy to the neighboring segment on the crossing filament .",
    "the total energy of the polymer can then be calculated from segments with @xmath198 only .",
    "there are two contributions .",
    "first , a stretching energy @xmath199 from the imposed affine strain field @xmath200 .",
    "second , a bending energy that is due to the relaxation of a neighboring segment on the crossing filament out of its affine reference state .",
    "this process requires that the segment of length @xmath201 moves the distance @xmath202 , which corresponds to its own affine deformation .",
    "the resulting bending energy @xmath203 now depends on the length @xmath51 of the segment under consideration as well as on the length @xmath201 of the neighboring ( now relaxed ) segment .",
    "as we have assumed above , the second contribution @xmath204 only arises if the length @xmath205 is shorter than the critical length @xmath197 .",
    "the total deformation energy along the polymer is then obtained by adding both contributions and integrating over all segments @xmath198 along the filament as well as averaging over neighbors with @xmath206 , @xmath207 where the prefactor @xmath208 just counts the number of segments per polymer . for simplicity ,",
    "we have not considered any dependence of the deformations on the orientation relative to the macroscopic strain field .",
    "in essence , this would only introduce some additional numerical prefactors that are irrelevant for the scaling picture developed here .",
    "the integrations are reparametrized by introducing the non - dimensional variable @xmath209 such that we arrive at the expression for the average polymer energy @xmath210 where numerical constants have been dropped and @xmath211 in the parameter range of interest .",

    "increasing the persistence length , the short segments one after the other loose their energies in favor of additional excitations in longer segments .",
    "this is fully consistent with the assumption of a growing non - affinity scale @xmath220 below which no energy is stored .",
    "it is important to realize that our derivation of the exponent does not make use of the precise form of the segment length distribution @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , there is no need to perform the integrations explicitly and only the limiting behavior of @xmath221 enters .",

    "we have also conducted simulations that assume a more general form for the stretching stiffness @xmath223 which reduces to the original definition for @xmath224 .",

    "while an affine strain @xmath0 would change all angles by an amount @xmath231 , due to the infinite rotational stiffness in the cross - links this can not actually occur .",
    "the segments therefore have to experience an extra bending contribution induced by cross - link rotations @xmath232 that restore the angles to their original values . in the parameter regime @xmath131 , where bending is the stiffer mode , we therefore expect strong contributions to the energy from the bending mode already in the affine reference state .",
    "allowing for the relaxation of the smallest segments from their stretched state to even stronger reduce the amount of stretching we might find an exponent as low as @xmath157 , signalling nearly exclusive contributions from the bending mode , not too surprising . in fact , we will argue below that neglecting the stretching energies , i.e. assuming an exponent of @xmath166 , represents a reasonable approximation to the elasticity in this regime .      by increasing @xmath153 from its small value",
    "we soften the bending mode and therefore reduce the influence of the fixed cross - link angles on the elastic energy . at the same time the non - affinity scale @xmath233 increases , indicating ever stronger deviations from the affine reference state .",
    "when , eventually , @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) the affine strain field does not serve as a reference configuration any more , since it is strongly perturbed by a majority of segments with @xmath236 . at this stage , the two branches , present in the cross - link dominated regime , merge and one enters a universal filament - dominated regime . there , the specific properties of the cross - links do not influence the macroscopic elasticity notably .",
    "while the scaling argument presented for the hinged network ceases to be applicable , the remaining residual forces @xmath182 continue to lead to a redistribution of stresses from shorter to longer segments , albeit at higher scales . as we have shown in @xcite , eventually about @xmath237 of the energy",
    "is stored in the longest @xmath238 of the segments only . the new feature",
    "as compared to the regime @xmath132 is that unloading of a segment from its stretched configuration will also lead to stretching of its immediate neighbor on the _ same _ filament ( see fig.[fig : mechanism]a ) .",
    "this way , the available energy for bending of the _ crossing _ filament , which was the primary contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : toten ] ) , is reduced . in the limit",
    "@xmath134 we can neglect these contributions and calculate the energy from the polymers stretching stiffness only .",
    "the physical picture is that of a serial connection of infinitely many segments along the backbone of a `` typical '' polymer .",
    "the stiffness of this polymer , and therefore the modulus , may be obtained from the stretching spring constants of the individual segments @xmath193 as @xmath239 corresponding to the exponent @xmath162 . for the more general response coefficient of eq.([eq : gen_k_entropic ] ) this argument predicts @xmath229 , a result which is closely confirmed by the results of the simulation as can be seen from the inset of fig.[fig : genexponents ] .",
    "note , that the shear modulus in this asymptotic region takes the same form as postulated by the affine theory in eq.([eq : gthermfoam ] ) .",
    "however , using eq.([eq : infserial ] ) one can resolve the effects according to segment length to find that the contribution to the total energy from segments with length @xmath51 grows as @xmath240 .",
    "this strong increase is in accord with the assumption of a large non - affinity scale , below which no energy is stored , and in striking contrast to the affine theory that would yield @xmath241 .",
    "we have studied the macroscopic elastic properties of networks of semi - flexible polymers .",
    "we provide exhaustive numerical studies supplemented by scaling arguments that elucidate the subtle interplay between the architecture of the network and the elastic properties of its building blocks .",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn is that , irrespective of the specific architecture chosen , thermally fluctuating stiff polymer networks are inherently more sensitive to polydispersity and randomness than their purely mechanical counterparts .",
    "this is due to their strongly length - dependent entropic stretching response @xmath242 which has to be contrasted with the mechanical stretching stiffness @xmath243 .",
    "although simulations have only been conducted in two - dimensional networks , the identified mechanism by which the structural randomness influences the elastic properties is expected to be of universal character and hold independent of dimensionality .",
    "as we have shown , the actual consequences of this susceptibility ( e.g. scaling behaviour of elastic moduli ) may vary from system to system and certainly also with the dimension .",
    "a precise knowledge of the network architecture is therefore indispensable for the interpretation of experimental data . for this it will be most important to develop new techniques that allow the characterization of the microstructure and monitor its changes upon deformation . as exemplified by the discussion in the universal regime sec .",
    "[ sec : universal - regime ] , where the ( non - affine ) elastic modulus turns out to be similar to that in an affine theory , we have shown that macroscopic measurements alone do not suffice to extract the network mechanics also on the microscopic scale .",
    "we have described how the polymer length @xmath111 can be used to drive the system from a simple cellular structure with filaments as short as the mesh - size @xmath244 , to a fully scale - invariant fibrous structure characterized by infinitely long filaments @xmath245 .",
    "especially the latter limit allows for intricate scaling behavior that impressively demonstrates the qualitative difference between thermally fluctuating and purely mechanical elastic networks .",
    "the elasticity of a simple cellular structure may be described by a serial connection of their elementary deformation modes bending and stretching , respectively .",
    "this leads to the modulus of eq.([eq : gfoam ] ) @xmath246 in this picture , deformations can be drawn from either mode and it will be the softer one that dominates the modulus . in fibrous networks with fixed cross - link angles",
    "we have shown that the modes rather act as if they were springs connected in parallel .",
    "the modulus can then be approximated by @xmath247 where the prefactors @xmath170 depend weakly on the scaling variable @xmath248 .",
    "the network elasticity is therefore always dominated by the stiffer mode , qualitatively similar to a triangulated network , where the specific geometry of the unit cell always imposes stretching deformations on the system , no matter how soft the bending mode actually is .",
    "the fibrous architecture apparently also suppresses the transition into regimes where the softer mode is dominant .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with recent simulations on the purely mechanical fiber model  @xcite , where a transition into a regime dominated by soft bending modes ( @xmath134 ) could only be observed at finite values for the filament length @xmath111 . increasing the length to asymptotic values @xmath245 , as we have done here ,",
    "such a `` bending - soft '' regime is strongly suppressed and eventually can not occur any more . instead , the elasticity is governed by the much stiffer ( mechanical ) stretching mode .",
    "a detailed theoretical explanation of how this suppression is generated in mechanical fiber networks will appear elsewhere  @xcite , however , it is clear that the mechanism that leads to bending in cellular structures can not work in fibrous networks .",
    "the fact , that any segment is part of the larger structure of the polymer fiber leads to strong geometric correlations and imposes very strict conditions on possible segmental deformations .",
    "allowing the filaments to freely rotate at the cross - links , a situation which may be relevant for f - actin networks cross - linked for example with @xmath5-actinin , we also find an asymptotic scaling regime where stretching and bending modes contribute equally to the elastic energy , eq.([eq : gpoly ] ) , @xmath249 by quantifying the degree of co - operation between neighboring elements in the network we were able to identify a non - affinity length - scale @xmath197 below which the state of affine deformations is rendered unstable .",
