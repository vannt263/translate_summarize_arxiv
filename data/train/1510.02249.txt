    "the manner in which cosmic ray ( cr ) particles are accelerated in the galaxy and how they propagate is still the subject of argument although it is generally agreed that up to a few pev or so supernova remnants ( snr ) play an important role , as does the diffusion in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite",
    ". however , there are a few problems of detail among which one is the following : + why , when the surface density of snr in the galaxy falls so rapidly with galactocentric radius , @xmath3 , for @xmath4kpc @xcite , does the cr intensity fall so slowly @xcite ?    in the recent past we have examined this question in some detail @xcite , but here we study the problem again in the light of superior data on the radial gradient of snr and the appreciation that in some models of particle injection into sn shocks the temperature of the ambient ism has relevance @xcite .",
    "the determination of the radial gradient is a matter of some difficulty on account of obscuration by dust and attenuation of the radio signals , by which distances are measured .",
    "two , rather extreme , estimates have been made , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first @xcite peaks at @xmath5kpc and drops to 40% of its peak value by @xmath6kpc whereas the second @xcite peaks at @xmath7kpc and falls to 15% by 10kpc .",
    "insofar as the analysis in @xcite is later and , @xcite points to shortcomings in the analysis of @xcite we adopt the results from @xcite .",
    "a representative surface density of snr from @xcite is given in figure 1 , denoted snr .",
    "the analysis of the gamma - ray emissivity in the galactic disk derived from the cos - b data by @xcite and @xcite showed a flatter distribution of crs than that of their presumed sources ( snr ) as derived even from @xcite .",
    "later work by @xcite as well as the emissivity from the fermi - lat @xcite came to the same conclusion ( see also for a review of the history of the radial gradient of the cr intensity @xcite ) . here",
    "we use an amalgam and present the result in figure 2 .",
    "it can be remarked that the problem of the difference between the radial gradient ( i.e. the dependence of cr density on the galactocentric radius @xmath3 ) of cr and sources is a live one .",
    "it seemed that a natural explanation would be an effective spatial mixing of crs due to the diffusion which produces a more or less uniform distribution of crs in different parts of the galactic disk if it is surrounded by a giant halo .",
    "however , numerical calculations of @xcite for the free escape boundaries have shown , that even in the most favorable case of an extended halo , the diffusion model is unable to remove the signature of the source distribution even for the relatively smooth snr distribution of @xcite .",
    "the problem is even more aggravated for the sharper snr distribution of @xcite .",
    "one of the explanations was suggested by @xcite who assumed that crs leave the disk faster from the regions of a higher concentration of snrs and that smoothes the cr distribution in the disk in comparison with that of snrs .",
    "here , we suggest an alternative explanation of this effect .      it is well known that there is a radial increase of the measured electron temperature in hii regions with the mean temperature from about 6600@xmath8k at @xmath9 to about 10000@xmath8k at @xmath10 ( @xcite and figure 1 ) .",
    "this fact arises from the galactic metallicity gradient - the fall in metallicity ( e.g. fe / h ) with increasing @xmath3 due to the reduced surface density of snr there ( e.g. figure 1 ) .",
    "the metals act as cooling agents .    the data on the mean temperature comes from measurements on hii regions and the resulting warm gas occupies on average some 30% of the available volume @xcite",
    "however , sn are frequently to be found in regions of ob - associations - and nearby hii objects - so that most snr will accelerate background electrons ( and protons ) having high temperatures . in what follows",
    "we assume that the cr all come from sn exploding in regions where the temperature is similar to that in the hii - temperature regions or , at least , the similarity is not radially dependent .",
    "the relevance of rising temperature of the ism with increasing galactocentric radius is that , as mentioned in  1 , in some cr acceleration models , two of which we examine below , the temperature of the ions in the ambient ism is related to the injection efficiency for the ions to take part in the acceleration process.the argument is that the particles in the high energy tail of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution above some high threshold energy @xmath11 have a number which rises rapidly with temperature when the mean energy @xmath12 is much less than @xmath11 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the situation .",
    "the inferred cr intensity is proportional to the product of the surface density of snr , @xmath13 , and the efficiency factor @xmath14 , where we assume that @xmath15 is a function of the electron temperature and is the fraction of the ionized gas having sufficiently high energy to enter the snr shock , i.e. the fraction with energy greater than @xmath11 .",
    "the problem is to find the necessary values of @xmath11 and @xmath15 .    in figure 4",
    "we give @xmath16 versus @xmath0 for various values of @xmath11 .",
    "indicated above the abscissa are the limiting values of @xmath3 : 2 and 14kpc to which the analysis refers ( the data are too sparse beyond 14kpc and there are complications within 2kpc due to black hole effects ) .",
    "examining figures 1 and 2 we see that an increase in efficiency of about a factor 30 is needed between @xmath17 and @xmath10 .",
    "figure 5 shows the ratio of @xmath15 vs. @xmath11 for @xmath10 and @xmath18 ; it shows that a factor of 30 results from @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath15-values are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and , writing @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 .",
    "it means that the fraction of interstellar plasma injected into the acceleration process can rise rapidly with the rising temperature .",
    "we have applied this idea to the known mechanisms of cr production in the galaxy : the stochastic fermi acceleration and acceleration by snr shocks .",
    "the equilibrium maxwellian momentum spectrum @xmath24 of a background plasma is formed by coulomb collisions .",
    "the equation for the distribution function , @xmath24 , of background plasma with temperature @xmath0 has a simple form ( see @xcite ) @xmath25=0\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the particle momentum , @xmath27 is the rate of coulomb losses , @xmath28 is the coefficient of spatial diffusion due to coulomb collisions , @xmath29 is the mass of the accelerated particles and @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the equilibrium maxwellian distribution follows , as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of background plasma and @xmath33 is the particle energy .",
    "if background particles are under the influence of any acceleration , e.g the fermi stochastic acceleration , @xmath34 , ( see @xcite ) , then the energy variations of particles in the range @xmath35 are described by the equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rate of ionization losses of a ion with the charge @xmath38 and the atomic number @xmath39 in a gas with the temperature @xmath0 and the density @xmath40 , which has the form ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath43 is the mass of the accelerated particles , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the rest masses of electrons and protons , and @xmath46 is the frequency of coulomb collisions of thermal particles .    for a proton ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) eq .",
    "[ en_var ] has the form @xmath49    from eq.([en_var1 ] ) the threshold energy , @xmath11 can be derived as @xmath50 which defines the energy range of accelerated particles with @xmath51 .",
    "we notice that the injection energy for a nucleus with mass @xmath43 , and the charge @xmath52 has the form @xmath53 as a result , the chemical composition of the accelerated particles differs from that of the background plasma ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the stochastic acceleration forms a power - law spectrum of nonthermal particles @xmath54 and the naive assumption is that the tail of nonthermal particles joins directly to the maxwellian distribution .",
    "the constant @xmath55 in this case is @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the power - law exponent of the spectrum .",
    "however , as @xcite showed , this equation strongly underestimates the number of accelerated particles ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the point is that under the influence of acceleration a flux of particles , running - away into the acceleration region , is formed and as a result the particle distribution is nonequilibrium and time variable .",
    "because of the running - away flux , the equation for the stochastic fermi acceleration is nonstationary : @xmath58=0\\ ] ]    for the case of weak acceleration , when @xmath59 , the ionization losses have a simple form @xmath60 and this equation can be solved analytically .",
    "this acceleration forms also a power - law spectrum but with the coefficient @xmath55 being different from that in eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) . for the momentum diffusion e.g. @xmath61",
    ", the distribution function of accelerated particles is @xmath62 where @xmath63 describes slow temporal variations of the density of background particles due to the effect of runaway flux .    in @xcite",
    "the stochastic acceleration was taken as a power - law , @xmath64 .",
    "for the fermi acceleration @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the frequency of acceleration . in fig.4 ( dash - dotted line )",
    "we present the fraction of accelerated particles as a function of the background temperature @xmath0 for the case of stochastic fermi acceleration with @xmath67 . in order to reproduce the fraction of accelerated particles @xmath68 at @xmath69 k we take the characteristic acceleration frequency @xmath70 s@xmath71 . here , and below @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "as @xcite concluded , the fraction of particles accelerated from a background plasma is higher than follows from eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the acceleration generates not only the tail of nonthermal particles but modifies also the component of the spectrum which is formed by coulomb collisions ( the maxwellian component ) . as a result",
    ", an extended transfer region is formed between the thermal and nonthermal parts of the spectrum .",
    "we notice , however , that this conclusion was derived in the framework of the equation when variations of the temperature @xmath0 are neglected , @xmath74 .",
    "however , as @xcite showed this effect is not negligible .",
    "the point is that the energy supplied by sources of stochastic acceleration was quickly absorbed by the thermal plasma because of the ionization / coulomb energy losses of accelerated particles . as a result",
    ", this acceleration is accompanied mainly by background plasma overheating instead of acceleration .",
    "this conclusion was later revised by @xcite for the case when the effect of acceleration has a cutoff at a low energy of the particles , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the heaviside function .",
    "this cutoff can be due to the absorption of mhd - waves by low energy crs ( see , in this respect , appendix a in @xcite ) .    in these conditions",
    "two competing effects arise : one of them is the plasma overheating which prevents the acceleration ; the other is a flux of particles from the thermal pool which cools down the plasma .",
    "as @xcite showed , for the case when @xmath77 , acceleration is more effective than the effect of plasma overheating , and the acceleration forms a prominent non - thermal tail . it is interesting to notice that in this case an extended transfer region between the thermal distribution and the tail of accelerated particle ( as in @xcite ) is not formed , and the power - law spectrum joins directly with the maxwellian distribution at the energy @xmath78 , that is identical to the estimations shown in fig.3 , where the vertical dashed line marks the position of @xmath78 .",
    "estimates of @xmath78 is beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "its value is determined by e.g. spectral characteristics of mgd waves , namely by processes of their excitation and absorption which are not targets of our analysis . for the effective acceleration",
    "we need the condition @xmath79 and we ad hoc assume them .",
    "the idea of particle acceleration by snr shocks has been suggested by krymskii @xcite , bell @xcite and many others .",
    "this idea is now confirmed by recent fermi - lat observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration suggested also that a fraction of crs is accelerated in ob association and their superbubbles @xcite .",
    "the medium inside superbubbles is filled by shock fronts generated by sn explosions and supersonic winds . in this conditions particles",
    "are accelerated by interaction with the supersonic turbulence @xcite this mechanism is similar to the classical fermi acceleration by magnetic fluctuaions / turbulence @xcite .    in the case of cr production by snrs ( that is the goal of this paper ) ,",
    "particles are accelerated by snr shocks . in the reference frame of a shock",
    ", the process is described by the equation ( see @xcite ) @xmath80 where the coordinate @xmath81 is perpendicular to the shock front , @xmath82 is the coefficient of particle spatial diffusion , @xmath83 is the particle fluid velocity and the velocity jump at the shock @xmath84 is @xmath85 for strong shocks with the mach number @xmath86 .",
    "the characteristic time of acceleration in this case is @xmath87 , and the spectrum of accelerated particles is power - law , @xmath88 , or for the energy spectrum @xmath89 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) we can estimate the value of @xmath11 when @xmath90 . in order to obtain @xmath91 for @xmath92",
    "k we take @xmath93 cm s@xmath71 and the spatial diffusion coefficient near the shock is @xmath94 @xmath95s@xmath71 .    for the case of shock acceleration from a background plasma",
    "the kinetic equation is two dimensional . as a result ,",
    "the particle spectrum varies in space , and this makes analysis of the acceleration processes quite arduous .",
    "this case of acceleration was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the equation has the form @xmath96=-\\frac{\\nabla { \\bf u}}{3}\\frac{1}{p^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}(p^2f ) \\label{shacc}\\ ] ] the solution describes the thermal and nonthermal components of the spectrum and as a result it allows us to estimate the number of accelerated particles as a function of the parameters of the background plasma . the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ shacc ] ) provided by @xcite is very bulky . therefore below",
    "we present only the final result for the nonthermal component of the spectrum at the shock ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this spectrum is @xmath98 from this equation we can derive the ratio @xmath99 : @xmath100\\frac{1}{3\\delta}\\right)\\right\\ } \\label{ratio}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the electron and proton mass respectively , @xmath101 is the mass of the accelerated particles , @xmath102 the ratio @xmath99 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) is shown in fig.4 ( dashed line ) . in the standard models of cr propagation",
    "the term describing cr injection by snrs is supposed to be proportional to the density of snrs , @xmath103 , at the galactocentric radius @xmath3 . however ,",
    "as one can see from fig.4 for the case of shock acceleration from a background plasma it depends also on the temperature of the background plasma .",
    "we see that both in our general consideration and in more sophisticated models the fraction of background particles injected into the acceleration process rises with the ambient ism temperature . in first order ,",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath104 for the fractions appear reasonable but there are a number of uncertainties . the most important concerns the extent to which the gas densities in the regions in which cr are accelerated are proportional to the total gas densities in those regions and the temperatures likewise . if they are then the value of @xmath11 will be appropriate and the @xmath15-values can be regarded as injection efficiencies and can be compared with the values commonly adopted ; for example , the values adopted as examples in @xcite range from @xmath105 to @xmath20 , i.e. in our range .",
    "writing @xmath106 we have @xmath107 .    in conclusion , we have presented a model in which the gradient of electron temperatures in the galaxy can make a contribution , at least , to solving the cosmic ray gradient problem . a proper evaluation of the implications of the background particle temperature effects for the cr gradient problem will require a more detailed analysis taking into account the acceleration and propagation processes in a self - consistent manner .",
