    "the current understanding of the collective properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can be summarized by so - called unification models ( e.g. , @xcite ) in which the observed properties of active galaxies are governed primarily by orientation and intrinsic luminosity . for low luminosity agn ( seyfert galaxies )",
    "a wide range of properties can be explained by differences of viewing angle to a nucleus surrounded by dusty obscuring material . if the viewing angle is such that the innermost region is not shielded from the observer , the optical spectrum is characterized by strong blue continuum and broad emission lines .",
    "however , if the line of sight happens to pass through a sufficient amount of obscuring material , the nuclear spectrum is dominated by narrower emission lines emitted by gas farther from the central engine . in this picture",
    ", the difference in line widths is naturally related to the depth of the potential well that the observer probes at different distances from the central object .",
    "more specifically , obscured ( type ii ) seyfert galaxies manifest themselves as narrow high - ionization emission line objects and outnumber unobscured broad line ( type i ) seyfert galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "unification models predict that agn output a significant fraction of their bolometric luminosity in the far - infrared because part of the uv and optical continuum is thermally reprocessed by circumnuclear dust . in obscured ( type ii ) agn the strong optical continuum is hidden from the observer , so the observed far - ir - to - optical ratios are expected to be large .",
    "these objects are also expected to have hard x - ray spectra because the gas along the line of sight absorbs soft x - rays and permits only the hard x - rays from the nucleus to escape directly .    if the same unification models apply to higher - luminosity agn ( quasars )",
    ", there should exist high - luminosity obscured agn ( type ii quasars ) which would be observable up to high redshifts .",
    "obscured agn have been postulated to account for the cosmic hard x - ray background @xcite , and type ii quasars might conveniently account for a large fraction of it . a number of different methods have been used hitherto to discover type ii quasars , but only a handful have been found .    in the optical , type",
    "ii quasar candidates have been selected as objects with narrow permitted emission lines and high - ionization line ratios .",
    "@xcite selected several candidates at @xmath6 as outliers from the standard color - color loci of stars , galaxies and quasars from the digital palomar observatory sky survey .",
    "@xcite selected one type ii quasar candidate at @xmath7 as a powerful ir source .",
    "this object was later confirmed to possess properties expected from a type ii quasar in the optical and in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "radio - loud type ii agn ( narrow - line radio galaxies ) are readily detectable in radio surveys and have been known for decades ( see @xcite for a review ) out to very high redshifts @xcite .",
    "a typical high - redshift radio galaxy requires a hidden quasar with a luminosity @xmath8 erg s@xmath2 in order to explain its powerful optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "several type ii quasar candidates have been selected as objects with unusually hard x - ray spectra ( @xcite at redshifts 2.01 , 3.7 , 3.29 , and 0.40 , respectively ) .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of these objects support their identifications as type ii quasars .",
    "in particular , in the optical they show high equivalent width , narrow emission lines with high - ionization line ratios .",
    "however , in many other cases follow - up optical observations of promising x - ray selected candidates revealed broad components in their permitted emission lines @xcite .",
    "overall , no more than 20% of hard x - ray sources in deep surveys have high - ionization narrow emission line optical counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ; or @xcite for an overview ) . in general ,",
    "x - ray and optical selection techniques , while complementing each other , do not necessarily reveal the same populations of objects .",
    "x - ray selection favors high - redshift objects , for which their hard x - ray spectra are redshifted into the observable range , so candidates found by x - ray surveys can be very faint optically ( down to @xmath9 ) . obtaining optical spectra of these candidates",
    "is thus a challenging task . on the other hand , very compton - thick type ii agn can be optically bright while being quite faint in x - rays @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) makes it possible to find a large number of type ii quasar candidates . in this paper",
    "we present a large sample ( 291 objects ) of high - ionization narrow emission line agn with @xmath0 from the sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "the sample includes seyfert ii galaxies as well as objects luminous enough to be called type ii quasar candidates .",
    "we briefly summarize relevant information on the sdss imaging , targeting for spectroscopy and processing of spectroscopic data in section [ data ] .",
    "we describe our selection procedure for type ii agn in section [ selection ] , and present the sample in section [ properties ] , where we discuss the collective and individual observed properties of the objects from our sample . in section [ composite ] we present the composite spectrum of type ii agn and we estimate their intrinsic luminosities in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey offers a unique opportunity to study large samples of agn with well - defined selection criteria .",
    "spectroscopic data for about 16,000 quasars , and many more lower - luminosity agn , are now publicly available @xcite .",
    "the high quality of the spectroscopic data and the size of the survey allow unprecedented study of the properties of agn .",
    "in particular , in our research we make extensive use of results from the study of nearby type ii agn and their host galaxies by @xcite and from the study of emission - line galaxies and nearby agn by @xcite .",
    "in addition to selecting large homogeneous samples of extragalactic objects , the survey is optimized for the discovery of rare and unusual objects .",
    "the combination of the size of the survey and the ` serendipity ' search program resulted in finding numerous unusual agn , such as extreme bal quasars @xcite , extremely red quasars @xcite , bl lac objects @xcite , and agn with double - peaked broad emission lines @xcite , and makes it possible to find a significant number of type ii quasars , as we describe in this paper .",
    "luminosities are calculated in a @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 cosmology ( also referred to in this paper as the @xmath13-cosmology ) .",
    "we use iau designations and j2000 coordinates for identifying objects ( e.g. , sdss j102746.03@xmath14003205.0 ) . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we use capital @xmath15 for redshifts and lower - case @xmath16 for the @xmath16-band magnitudes .",
    "all wavelengths of the emission lines in the text are vacuum wavelengths taken from the atomic line listpeter / atomic ) ] ; the conventionally used air wavelengths are listed in table 2 . all equivalent widths ( ews ) and all full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) are rest - frame values .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) uses a drift - scanning imaging camera @xcite and a 640 fiber double spectrograph on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope .",
    "it is an ongoing survey to image 10,000 sq .",
    "deg . of the sky in the sdss @xmath17",
    "ab magnitude system @xcite and to obtain spectra for @xmath18 galaxies and @xmath19 quasars .",
    "the astrometric calibration is good to better than @xmath20 rms per coordinate @xcite , and the photometric calibration is accurate to 3% or better @xcite .",
    "we use petrosian magnitudes for resolved sources and psf magnitudes for unresolved sources as measures of flux ; asterisks on magnitudes indicate that preliminary photometry is used ( see description in @xcite ) .",
    "we now proceed to describe targeting for spectroscopy .",
    "about 66% of the main spectroscopic survey is the galaxy sample .",
    "resolved sources are targeted as galaxies , down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) constitute about 9% of the spectroscopic survey and are targeted based on their distinctive colors down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "another 13% of the survey are quasar candidates targeted based on their colors down to @xmath23 , plus additional high - redshift candidates ( @xmath24 ) which are targeted to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "objects in the few untargeted regions of color space outside the main stellar locus , plus objects with radio emission detected by the first survey @xcite , plus objects with x - ray emission detected by the rosat survey @xcite can also be selected to @xmath26 as ` serendipity ' targets @xcite which constitute about 4% of the spectroscopic survey .",
    "fibers are allocated according to a tiling algorithm @xcite with the galaxy sample and the quasar sample being the top priorities .",
    "the remaining 8% of fibers serve for calibration purposes .",
    "a small number of plates are devoted to miscellaneous projects that are not part of the main spectroscopic survey ; for such plates , target selection algorithms different from those discussed above were applied .",
    "for some plates , hereafter designated `` special plates '' , resolved objects with @xmath27 were targeted , with a preference to objects bluer than normal galaxies ( on average , about 1 mag bluer in @xmath28 than the main galaxy sample ) .",
    "most objects on the special plates are emission - line galaxies .",
    "a few plates are dedicated to the spectroscopic follow - up of the deep southern equatorial scan ( dses ; a project for repeat imaging of certain fields in the southern portion of the sdss area ) . for these plates ,",
    "hereafter designated `` dses plates '' , the quasar , high - redshift quasar and serendipity selection algorithms select objects somewhat fainter ( up to 1 mag ) than in the main spectroscopic sample .",
    "sdss spectra are obtained using plates holding 640 fibers , each of which subtends 3@xmath29 on the sky ; the spectra cover @xmath30 with resolution of @xmath31 and sampling of @xmath32 pixels per resolution element .",
    "the relative and absolute spectrophotometric calibration is good to @xmath33 .",
    "some objects have multiple spectra , either because they lie on multiple plates ( which is done for quality assurance purposes ) or because a plate was observed more than once .",
    "the spectra presented in this paper are co - additions of all available spectra using inverse variance weighting at each pixel .",
    "spectral flux errors per pixel in most cases are about @xmath34 erg s@xmath2 @xmath35 @xmath2 .",
    "redshifts are automatically assigned by the sdss spectral classification algorithm , which is based on @xmath36 fitting of templates to each spectrum ( schlegel et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "averaged over the whole survey , about 99% of redshift determinations are correct , as confirmed by visual inspection .",
    "in this section we describe the selection procedure aimed at finding objects with optical properties expected of obscured agn in the sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "we search for objects with narrow emission lines without underlying broad components and with line ratios characteristic of non - stellar ionizing radiation .",
    "we discuss how we distinguish them from star - forming galaxies , in particular low - metallicity emission line systems , and narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      in this paper",
    "we discuss objects with redshifts in the range @xmath0 .",
    "detailed studies of local ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 mag ) agn from the sdss are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we only considered objects with @xmath39 to disfavor selection of low - luminosity objects .",
    "we restricted the analysis in this paper to redshifts @xmath40 in order to have the [ oiii ] 5008 line ( the strongest expected emission line ) present in all spectra , to be able to study the emission line properties of the objects statistically .",
    "( we use vacuum wavelengths throughout this paper , but air wavelenths are listed in table 2 for convenience . )",
    "we required signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) @xmath41 , where by `` signal '' here we mean the flux density in the 7th brightest pixel over the whole spectroscopic range ( about 3840 pixels ) and by `` noise '' we mean the median estimated flux error per pixel over all pixels .",
    "this unconventional criterion allows us to keep objects with weak continua but strong narrow emission lines , while rejecting low s / n continuum sources . for illustration , an emission line with fwhm@xmath42 km s@xmath2 occupies about 7 pixels of the spectroscopic range .",
    "we avoid using the brightest pixels because they can be strongly affected by sky subtraction and other instrumental problems .    in order to select emission line objects",
    ", we required the rest - frame equivalent width of the [ oiii ] 5008 line to be @xmath43 .",
    "the division in line width between narrow - line and broad - line agn is not well determined in the literature ; moreover , the width criteria are applied to different permitted lines depending on which are available in the spectrum .",
    "the specific fwhm criteria range from 1000 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) to 2000 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite provided a formal separation criterion by showing that the width distribution of the h@xmath44 line is strongly bimodal among agn , with a significant dip at fwhm(h@xmath44)@xmath45 km s@xmath2 .",
    "lines can be broadened by splitting , outflows or other effects , as discussed in section [ unusual ] below .",
    "to retain such unusual objects , we adopted the more conservative criterion fwhm(h@xmath46)@xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , this criterion by itself does not reject some genuinely unobscured objects , in particular , nlsy1 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our high - ionization selection criteria are designed to disfavor selection of these objects based on the emission line ratios , as described in section [ high - ion ] .",
    "below we show that the results of our selection are not very sensitive to the exact value used for the line width cut .    at the redshifts of our sample ( @xmath39 )",
    "the projected aperture of the fiber ( 3@xmath29 ) is greater than 13.4 kpc , and thus the spectra include most of the light from the host galaxy .",
    "the emission lines coming from the nuclei can be significantly contaminated by stellar absorption lines from the host galaxy , so we subtract the host galaxy contribution from each spectrum before measuring the line parameters following @xcite . to perform this subtraction , we fit each spectrum to a linear combination of several templates and minimize the residuals to find the best - fit combination .",
    "we use the following templates : ( a ) the first seven principal component analysis ( pca ) components derived from a large sample of high s / n , pure absorption line sdss galaxies ; ( b ) an a - type star template to account for recent star formation in the host galaxy and ( c ) a power - law component proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "we have to use the a star template explicitly because the pure absorption - line galaxies used in the pca contain only old stellar populations ( galaxies with a lot of young stars are likely to show emission lines from associated hii regions ) .",
    "the power - law component is introduced to represent any continuum contribution from the nucleus and , possibly , very young o and b stars .",
    "the fitting procedure is applicable to rest wavelengths @xmath48 for which there exist reliable galaxy templates . in the final fit , the stellar contribution ( stars of the spectral type a and later )",
    "is the linear combination of templates ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we subtract the stellar contribution from the original spectrum and then proceed with characterizing the emission lines .",
    "we fit all emission lines with gaussian profiles .",
    "a constant fit to the continuum in the vicinity of the line is used . the best - fit height and the width of the profiles ,",
    "the wavelength of the peak of the flux , as well as the continuum level are obtained by minimizing @xmath36 .",
    "our goal was to reject all objects with broad components in their emission lines . due to the spectroscopic coverage , the strong permitted lines that are available for study are h@xmath44 and h@xmath46 for @xmath49 and h@xmath46 and mgii 2800 for @xmath50 .",
    "many objects show weak broad components in h@xmath46 and/or h@xmath44 , in addition to much stronger narrow components ; automated procedures attempting to detect underlying weak broad components were found to be inefficient because the narrow lines often show deviations from the gaussian shape ( e.g. , asymmetry or splitting ) .",
    "we fitted the h@xmath51[nii ] 6550 , 6585 and h@xmath52[oiii ] 4960 , 5008 line complexes with four gaussians .",
    "the [ nii ] 6550 , 6585 lines are fitted with gaussian profiles of the same width and with the height ratio of 1/3 as required by the energy level structure of the [ nii ] ion @xcite .",
    "[ oiii ] 4960 , 5008 are fitted in the same way .",
    "we fitted balmer lines with two gaussian components and excluded all objects with strong broad components , i.e. whose broad component had a fwhm of at least 2000 km s@xmath2 and the same amplitude ( peak @xmath53 ) as the narrow component or larger .",
    "we then visually inspected all other spectra and rejected all objects where the broad component could be detected above the noise level .",
    "mgii 2800 requires a different fitting procedure .",
    "because the narrow component of mgii 2800 is generally quite weak compared to the broad component ( if the latter is present ) , we fit mgii 2800 with only a single component and reject all objects with fwhm@xmath542000 km s@xmath2 if the amplitude of the line is detected above the noise level .",
    "however , a broad component with amplitude comparable with the noise ( i.e. , about @xmath55 erg s@xmath2 @xmath35 @xmath2 ) can not be detected by any of our procedures ; it is therefore possible that deeper spectroscopy could reveal broad components in some of the objects in our sample .",
    "whenever available , we combined ( using error - weighting ) multiple observations of the same object to obtain a higher s / n spectrum , and rejected objects which have a broad component in balmer lines or in mgii 2800 in the co - added spectrum .",
    "this procedure reveals weak broad components in about 6% of objects with multiple spectra . to determine whether the sample remains significantly contaminated by objects with weak broad components",
    ", we constructed a composite spectrum of the entire sample ( see section [ composite ] ) .",
    "there remains a possibility that for @xmath56 there is a broad component in h@xmath44 which is redshifted out of the spectral range , while there is none at an observable level in h@xmath46 .",
    "however , at these redshifts mgii 2800 is present in the spectra and can be used as an additional check .",
    "whether some of objects at @xmath57 have broad components in h@xmath44 ( while only having a narrow mgii 2800 ) can only be resolved with near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "the idea to use emission line ratios to distinguish between ionization mechanisms goes back to @xcite ( and references therein ) , with high - ionization line ratios being indicative of photoionization by the underlying power - law agn continuum . to distinguish type ii agn from other narrow emission line objects ( star - forming galaxies and nlsy1 galaxies ) we used diagnostic diagrams in the form suggested by @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic database provides a large number of emission - line galaxies which enables detailed statistical studies of the properties of the objects in different regions of the diagnostic diagrams @xcite .",
    "we measure the relative fluxes of several emission lines ( h@xmath46 , [ oiii ] 5008 , h@xmath44 , [ nii ] 6585 and [ sii ] 6718 , 6733 ) and then apply the agn diagnostic , which in analytical form is @xmath585008}{\\rm h\\beta}\\right)>\\frac{0.61}{\\log({\\rm [ nii]/h\\alpha})-0.47}+1.19;\\label{diag1}\\\\ \\log\\left(\\frac{\\rm [ oiii]5008}{\\rm h\\beta}\\right)>\\frac{0.72}{\\log({\\rm [ sii]/h\\alpha})-0.32}+1.30.\\label{diag2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite and @xcite use an additional criterion involving the [ oi ] 6302 line ; we do not employ it in our selection because this line is weak , and for our redshift coverage it lies in the red part of the spectrum where sky subtraction is particularly difficult , making this line an unreliable measure .",
    "we use criteria ( [ diag1])-([diag2 ] ) for objects at redshifts @xmath49 . for @xmath59 , the [ sii ] 6718 ,",
    "6733 lines are redshifted out of the observed range so that criterion ( [ diag2 ] ) can no longer be applied . finally , at @xmath56 h@xmath44 moves out of the spectroscopic range , so criterion ( [ diag1 ] ) can not be used either .",
    "for @xmath56 we adopt the following criteria :    1 .",
    "the [ oiii ] 5008/h@xmath46 ratio requirement in reduced form : @xmath605008}{\\rm h\\beta}\\right)>0.3 . \\label{reduced}\\ ] ] as can be seen from the diagnostic diagrams of @xcite and @xcite , agn satisfy this criterion , but the majority of objects that meet this criterion at low redshift are low - metallicity emission - line galaxies .",
    "we restricted our selection to @xmath39 , so we disfavor selection of star - forming galaxies relative to agn due to the intrinsically lower luminosities of the former . nevertheless , criterion ( [ reduced ] ) alone is not sufficient to distinguish type ii agn from star - forming galaxies . 2 .",
    "in addition , a sign of agn activity should be present : either ( a ) the high - ionization lines [ nev ] 3347 , 3427 should be detected , or ( b ) fwhm([oiii])@xmath61 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the [ neiii ] 3870 line can be prominent in the spectra of star - forming regions @xcite , but the higher ionization [ nev ] 3347 , 3427 lines are unambiguously characteristic of agn activity .",
    "when low s / n does not allow detection of [ nev ] lines , we rely on the correlation between line width and ionization ratios established by @xcite .",
    "this correlation implies that the majority of agn have fwhm([oiii])@xmath61 km s@xmath2 , while star - forming galaxies have fwhm([oiii])@xmath62 km s@xmath2 .",
    "low - metallicity emission line systems can be a source of confusion due to their large [ oiii ] 5008/h@xmath46 ratios @xcite but they have fwhm([oiii])@xmath63 km s@xmath2 .",
    "although originally the criteria of @xcite were only used to distinguish agn from star - forming galaxies , we found the high - ionization criteria very useful in rejecting nlsy1 galaxies , which are characterized by narrow h@xmath46 ( fwhm@xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) , weak [ oiii ] 4960 , 5008 and strong feii lines ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , one observational definition of nlsy1 includes the criterion [ oiii]5008/h@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "reassuringly , not a single nlsy1 object from the sdss early data release catalogued by @xcite met the high - ionization selection criteria presented here .",
    "we also do not see any sign of the feii emission blend around @xmath65 in any of the type ii agn candidates we selected . because the high - ionization criteria efficiently reject nlsy1 , the results of our selection are remarkably insensitive to the line width cut that we set at fwhm(h@xmath46)@xmath1 km s@xmath2 , with only a few objects having 1000@xmath66fwhm(h@xmath46)@xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we further address possible contamination of our sample by nlsy1 in section [ comp_contaminants ] .",
    "finally , although we do not rely on the [ neiii ] 3870 line in our selection , we find that objects that we select generally fall in the agn region of the diagnostic diagrams involving [ neiii ] 3870 from @xcite ( the diagrams of [ neiii]/h@xmath46 vs [ oii]/h@xmath46 and [ oiii]/h@xmath46 ) .",

    "these fractions are quite high considering that dses and special plates only constitute 5.5% and 0.7% , correspondingly , of the initial sample ( 33 and 4 plates out of the 600 plates to which the selection algorithm was applied ) .",
    "this suggests that target selection algorithms used for dses and special plates favor selection of type ii agn .",
    "the high selection efficiency on dses plates is due to the deeper magnitude limits for the quasar and serendipity algorithms on these plates , whereas low - luminosity type ii agn are effectively targeted on special plates due to the preferential selection of objects bluer than normal galaxies .",
    "we remark that our sample of type ii agn is not complete . for the samples of low - redshift sdss agn by @xcite and @xcite",
    "the selection criteria are well - defined because agn are selected from the main galaxy sample . in our sample",
    ", many objects were targeted for spectroscopy as serendipity sources which are sampled for spectroscopy only if fibers remain available after galaxy and quasar candidates have been allocated fibers . a large fraction of the sample was observed on dses or special plates where targeting algorithms varied with time and depended on specific tasks of the specialized surveys . moreover , spectroscopic selection partly relies on the presence of the weak [ nev ] 3347 , 3427 lines , and thus is dependent on s / n .      in this section",
    "we compare the colors of type ii agn with those of other objects . for a comparison sample , we selected all objects from 100 spectroscopic plates with assigned redshifts @xmath0 ( about 5700 objects ) , most of which are lrgs and quasars .",
    "figure [ zc ] shows redshift - color diagrams for type ii agn in comparison with lrgs and quasars .",
    "type ii agn show a large color scatter at a given redshift and generally have colors intermediate between those of lrgs and of quasars .",
    "the main quasar locus exhibits complicated redshift - dependent behavior as emission lines move in and out of the filters ( see @xcite for details ) ; vertical lines indicate redshifts at which color changes are expected to occur .",
    "the colors of lrgs behave as expected for an old stellar population placed at different redshifts .",
    "the range of ews of bright emission lines accounts for some of the scatter of the colors of type ii agn , as well as for some features of the redshift dependence . for example , the @xmath73 color in figure [ zc](d ) changes dramatically at @xmath74 when the h@xmath52[oiii ] 4960 , 5008 line complex moves from the @xmath75 band to the @xmath16 band , similarly to the change of the colors of normal quasars . the maximum equivalent width of the [ oiii ] 5008 line is about 1400  for the objects in our sample . together with the [ oiii ] 4960 line ( its flux is 1/3 of the flux of [ oiii ] 5008 , @xcite ) and a much weaker h@xmath46 , the maximum equivalent width of the line complex is about 1900 .",
    "the change of magnitude in band @xmath76 with width @xmath77 ( about 1000@xmath78 for sdss filters ) due to the presence of emission lines is @xmath79 and thus the maximum change in color introduced by the h@xmath46+[oiii ] complex is about 0.7 mag .",
    "the ews of this line complex range between about 15  and 1900 , and lines with ews at the lower limit give a negligible contribution to the color .",
    "even if the underlying continuum has the same spectral energy distribution in all objects , the varying ews of emission lines alone can account for the scatter of the @xmath80 and @xmath73 colors of type ii agn in figures [ zc](c , d ) .    the same argument",
    ", however , does not apply to figure [ zc](b ) , where a large scatter in the @xmath81 color ( @xmath821.5 mag ) is present even though the brightest line complex h@xmath52[oiii ] is redshifted out of both bands at @xmath83 .",
    "all type ii agn have @xmath81 color significantly bluer than that of an old stellar population ( as can be seen from comparison with the position of the lrg locus ) . unlike galaxies ,",
    "many type ii agn are detected in the @xmath84 band as we show in figure [ zc](a ) , and have colors that are different from those of quasars .",
    "in other words , there is evidence for a varying blue component in the spectral energy distribution of type ii agn as compared to an old stellar population .",
    "we have been unable to quantify the contribution of the blue component to the spectra of individual objects .",
    "stellar absorption features ( e.g. , caii 3935 , 3970 absorption lines ) are readily seen in the spectra of many type ii agn , but when we subtract the stellar contribution according to the procedure described in section [ line_width ] , the residual continua have very low s / n .",
    "we discuss the nature of the blue component in section [ comp_continuum ] using the composite spectrum of the entire sample .      in this section",
    "we compare the emission line properties of our sample of type ii agn with those of broad - line agn . for a comparison sample , we took all objects from 100 plates with assigned redshifts @xmath40 spectroscopically classified as broad - line agn  overall , 1954 objects .",

    "the range of line luminosity ratios is @xmath87[oiii]/@xmath87[oii]@xmath8810 , with 4 being the median value , consistent with the ratio of line fluxes of 5.97 for the composite spectrum of quasars @xcite and with other studies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in figure [ oii_oiii ] ,",
    "type ii agn tend on average to have slightly less luminous [ oiii ] 5008 for a given [ oii ] 3728 luminosity than broad - line agn . to quantify this trend we plot the distributions of [ oiii]/[oii ] ratios for both types of agn in figure [ oii_oiii_distribution ] .",
    "the effect is opposite in sign to reddening : the shorter - wavelength line would have been extincted more in obscured agn if the two lines originated in the same location .",
    "our result is in agreement with many previous studies showing that [ oiii ] 5008/[oii ] 3728 ratios are higher in broad - line agn than in narrow - line agn @xcite .",
    "this trend might imply that the ionization parameter of the narrow - line region ( the ratio of ionizing flux to density ) that governs the balance of ionized species is higher in type i agn than in type ii agn .",
    "this difference could be due to geometric effects related to anisotropic obscuration .",
    "alternatively , one might suggest that the [ oiii]-emitting region is subject to more reddening than the [ oii]-emitting region . in this case",
    "a necessary requirement is that the ionization parameter should rise inward .",

    "we produced a composite spectrum of the type ii agn in order to reveal weak emission lines , to study the underlying continuum , and to discuss possible types of contaminants to the sample .",
    "we start by shifting each spectrum to the rest frame determined from the [ oiii ] 5008 emission line redshift . constructing the composite using the redshift of the [ oii ] 3728 line made no significant difference .",

    "since fewer objects contribute to the ends of the covered spectral range , the blue and red parts of the composite spectra have lower s / n than the central part .      an expanded version of the variance - weighted composite spectrum in the range 2700 - 7100   is shown in figure [ blowup ] . the contribution from the host galaxy",
    "was subtracted according to the procedure described in section [ line_width ] .",
    "the part of the spectrum where host galaxy templates are unavailable is plotted with a dotted line .",
    "we compared the composite spectrum of type ii agn to the composite spectrum of sdss quasars @xcite and identified all emission features as labeled in figure [ blowup ] based on their wavelength position ( see @xcite for a complete list of references on line identifications ) . in this manner",
    "we identified 26 emission features in this wavelength range .",
    "we then fit the emission lines with gaussian profiles , and from the best - fit parameters of the gaussian fitting we calculate relative fluxes of emission lines .",

    "the same effect is seen for the high s / n emission line [ oiii ] 5008 ( section [ em_lines ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath44/h@xmath46 ratio of 4.0 in the type ii agn composite suggests that there is a reddening of about @xmath90 mag toward the region where the narrow balmer lines originate , assuming that the intrinsic ratio is ( h@xmath44/h@xmath46)@xmath91=3.1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the variance - weighted composite spectrum presented in figure [ two_composites](a ) shows no sign of the feii emission blend around @xmath65 prominent in high s / n spectra of nlsy1 @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is clear from figure [ hbeta_width ] that the distributions of h@xmath46 fwhm are very different for type ii agn and for nlsy1 from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in section [ selection ] , our high - ionization criteria strongly disfavor selection of nlsy1 , and the feii emission blend is not seen in the spectra of any individual objects in our sample .",
    "this suggests that our sample is not contaminated by appreciable numbers of nlsy1 .",
    "we also do not see any evidence for broad components in permitted lines ( mgii 2800 , h@xmath44 , h@xmath46 ) .",
    "we conclude that our selection procedure efficiently rejected objects with weak underlying broad components in these lines .      in section [ colors ] , based on the photometric data",

    "the continuum flux density of type ii agn in our sample is for the most part detected with low s / n and the shape of the continuum can not be studied based on spectra of individual objects .",
    "the contributions to the continuum can now be discussed using the high s / n composite spectrum .",
    "the composite spectra ( figure [ two_composites ] ) show evidence for an old stellar population through caii 3935 , 3970 absorption lines . apart from this contribution",
    ", there is evidence for the presence of young stars through the high - order balmer absorption lines ( four absorption features , h9 ",
    "h12 , between the [ oii ] 3728 and the [ neiii ] 3870 emission lines are clearly detected ) and the strength of the balmer edge at 3650 .",
    "these features are very characteristic of a stars , and are also the strongest spectral features of o and b stars in the optical .",
    "a - type stars , however , can not explain the strong blue and uv continuum apparent in figure [ two_composites ] .",
    "the problem of the excess blue continuum of seyfert ii galaxies has been known for a long time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of options have been discussed ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and some have been convincingly ruled out .",
    "for example , thermal emission from the scattering plasma @xcite produces a very high ratio of heii 4687 to h@xmath46 .",
    "our heii 4687/h@xmath46 of @xmath92 is consistent with predictions of standard photoionization models @xcite and , following the argument by @xcite , we conclude that the contribution to the continuum from this mechanism is negligible .    scattered light from the nucleus is another possibility but the broad components of permitted emission lines would have been scattered , too . since broad components are not observed , an upper limit can be placed on the contribution from the scattered light from the nucleus .",
    "assuming that the scattered component has the same spectrum as the composite spectrum of broad - line sdss quasars @xcite , we estimate that no more than 8% of the continuum of type ii agn at @xmath93 and no more than 20% of the continuum at @xmath94 can be due to the scattered light .",
    "the resolution of the problem of excess blue continuum appears to be the strong correlation between nuclear activity and starbursts in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "very young o and b stars can supply the necessary amount of uv continuum , their only observable spectroscopic features in the optical being balmer absorption lines and the balmer edge .    to study this possibility further , in figure",
    "[ binned ] we plot geometric mean composite spectra in logarithmic bins of the [ oiii ] 5008 line luminosities .",
    "unexpectedly , with increasing line luminosity , balmer absorption lines and balmer edge disappear .",
    "in fact , no stellar features from young stars are apparent in the two highest luminosity bins ( the caii 3970 absorption line is due to the old stellar population ) .",
    "the absence of these features had been historically put in an argument against the stellar origin of the blue continuum .",
    "we remark that the highest - luminosity composite spectrum looks similar to the optical spectrum of mrk477 , a nearby luminous type ii agn , which also does not have absorption features from young stars . in mrk477",
    "a starburst is directly detected in the far - uv , and @xcite showed that balmer absorption lines and balmer edge due to o and b stars are washed out by line emission in this object .",
    "we suggest that the same mechanism is operating in the most luminous type ii agn in our sample .",
    "as was mentioned before , the sdss fibers subtend more than 13.4 kpc on the sky at the redshifts of the objects in the sample , and the spectra include most of the light from the host galaxy , so from the spectra alone we can not infer whether the starburst is circumnuclear or occurs in the outer parts of the galaxy . traditionally it was thought that the starburst occurs on the sub - kpc scales near the nucleus ; this is supported by investigations of nearby seyfert ii galaxies showing circumnuclear starbursts with sizes of several hundred parsecs @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argued recently that the starbursts in agn are spread out over several kpc .",
    "as discussed in section [ introduction ] , multi - wavelength observations are essential to develop a physical model for type ii agn .",
    "in particular , if these objects are obscured , the optical continuum magnitude is by definition a poor indication of the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "we therefore use the [ oiii ] 5008 emission line as a proxy of the agn activity , as it is emitted from the extended ( and therefore presumably less obscured ) narrow line region .",
    "there is no general agreement in the literature on which narrow emission line , [ oiii ] 5008 or [ oii ] 3728 , can best serve as a nuclear luminosity indicator . in this work and in many previous studies ( section [ em_lines ] and references therein )",
    "it was concluded that the [ oiii ] 5008/[oii ] 3728 ratios are higher in broad - line agn than in narrow - line agn , but @xcite do not confirm this trend .",
    "@xcite argues that such studies suffer from incompleteness and that the [ oiii ] 5008 line is a good indicator of the underlying nuclear continuum .",
    "@xcite find that [ oii ] 3728 can be significantly contaminated by star formation in the host galaxy , while @xcite suggest that the same effect is negligible for the [ oiii ] 5008 line .",
    "following these authors , we use [ oiii ] 5008 as the luminosity indicator .",
    "in addition to all these possible complications , all emission lines can be subject to extinction by interstellar dust in the host galaxy and in our galaxy .",
    "this effect is usually corrected for by using the balmer decrement , but we do not have spectral coverage of the h@xmath44 line for most of the sample .",
    "interstellar extinction should affect type i and type ii agn in a similar way , so we ignore this effect for the purposes of the comparative analysis .",

    "the [ oiii ] luminosity function of low - redshift type ii agn by @xcite extends up to @xmath87[oiii]@xmath127 , and the sample by @xcite includes four objects with @xmath87[oiii]@xmath124 . based on the line luminosity criterion @xmath87[oiii]@xmath124 , we identify 21 type ii quasar candidates among the samples of nearby ( @xmath128 ) agn by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we considered all objects in these samples spectroscopically classified by the authors as seyfert ii galaxies and calculated [ oiii ] 5008 line luminosities in the @xmath13-cosmology from the line fluxes and redshifts given in these compilations .",
    "the most luminous type ii quasar candidates from these samples ( @xmath87[oiii]@xmath129 ) are iras b094335.8@xmath89130710 , iras b105111.2@xmath89272314 , mrk34 , mrk463 and mrk477 .    estimating the space density of type ii agn or their fraction in the agn population is a very important task which is , however , beyond the scope of this paper due to the incompleteness of the sample . in our future work",
    ", we hope to set useful bounds on the space density of luminous type ii agn based on the small subsample selected by the quasar targeting algorithm .",
    "we emphasize that multi - wavelength studies of the sample are necessary to support their physical interpretation as obscured agn .",
    "although technically challenging given the optical flux from the objects in the sample , optical spectropolarimetry would directly confirm the presence of a hidden broad - line region and underlying ionizing continuum through scattered light .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy of the h@xmath44 region for @xmath57 objects would place the objects on conventional diagnostic diagrams , resolve the questions of underlying broad components , and allow for extinction correction using balmer decrements .",
    "mid - ir imaging would allow us to compare the spectral energy distribution of our type ii agn candidates with that of known obscured agn and with theoretical models , while far - ir imaging would allow direct estimates of bolometric luminosities .",
    "column densities of the gas along the line of sight can be inferred from the x - ray spectra .",
    "studies of radio properties would allow comparisons between optically - selected type ii agn and radio galaxies .",
    "such follow - up studies would allow us to estimate the efficiency of optical selection and to study the differences between the populations selected by different techniques . finally , by studying host galaxies and environments of agn , one could establish just which properties of the galactic hosts and environments are associated with activity in agn .",
    "work is underway in all these areas , and we will report on the results in future papers .",
    "the sample of type ii agn presented here was selected based on about a quarter of all spectroscopic data that will have been obtained by the sdss upon its completion in 2005",
    ". we will be able to substantially expand the sample of type ii quasar candidates as the sdss progresses .",
