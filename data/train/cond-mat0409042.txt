    "the existence of a critical value , @xmath96 , for @xmath97 implies that the parameter space , @xmath98 , is divided into two regions , diffusive and superdiffusive .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the diffusive region defined by the condition @xmath99 is the elliptical region , @xmath100 , inscribed within the triangular phase - space .",
    "interestingly , the area of this diffusive region is @xmath101 which is roughly @xmath102 of the available phase - space area .",
    "this may be contrasted with the binary case where it is exactly @xmath103 .",
    "now the question arises whether a diffusive subregion of the ternary is likely to be mapped into a superdiffusive region of the binary due to a coarse - graining process .",
    "since a mapping of a set of three symbols to a set of two symbols always introduces a global bias in the resulting binary system , it is necessary to reformulate the binary case so that we can identify long - range correlation in a biassed sequence .     and",

    "we write @xmath119 where @xmath120 $ ] pametrizes the deviation from the intrinsic bias of the coin .",
    "we then have @xmath121 in order to check whether the equality @xmath117 holds good for @xmath33 in the range @xmath122 $ ] , we have generated [ 8 ] a large number of sequences each consisting of upto hundred thousand symbols for @xmath123 .",
    "we find that @xmath124 for @xmath125 and decreases fast to the value @xmath126 for @xmath127 . on the other hand ,",
    "the variance @xmath128 turns out to be proportional to @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and to @xmath0 for @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that @xmath44 , defined as above , does not lead to the expected constant value for @xmath132 , whereas @xmath133 correctly defines the correlation exponent .",
    "since the above definition of @xmath44 is derived from eq.(23 ) for @xmath116 , we have to check whether eq.(23 ) is a valid definition also for the biassed case . treating @xmath44 as a parameter to be fixed later",
    ", we can easily show that the probability , @xmath134 , that there are @xmath18 zeros in the sequence satisfies the following equation in the continuum limit : @xmath135}{\\partial x}\\ ] ] solving this equation , we can show that the distribution , @xmath136 , peaks at @xmath137 asymptotically where @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "thus , the peak will remain fixed at @xmath139 for all values of @xmath33 only if @xmath140 .",
    "this leads to the following definition for @xmath116 : @xmath141 \\right ) = 2b(1 - g_0 ) + ( 2g_0 - 1)\\frac{n_0}{n}\\ ] ] it is a general definition applicable even to an unbiassed sequence ( _ i.e. , _ reduces to the definition , eq.(23 ) , for @xmath142 ) .",
    "the variance of the distribution is given by , @xmath143 since @xmath119 , long - range correlation in the sequence will be characterized by the values of @xmath33 in the range @xmath144 , -1 + [ 1/b])$ ] .",
    "again , we have numerically checked [ 8 ] that the condition @xmath140 ( @xmath145 in our case ) does ensure the constancy of @xmath146 and , more importantly , we have confirmed that the variance has the above expected behaviour . in other words ,",
    "the lrc behavior of a binary sequence is characterized by the exponent , @xmath147 , for @xmath130 .",
    "assume that the symbols zero and one of the ternary are identified as @xmath21 while the symbol two is identified as @xmath22. then the _ a priori _ probability for @xmath21 and @xmath22 will be @xmath148 the condition for non - trivial correlations then turns out to be @xmath149 , above the lower line shown in fig.1 .",
    "the entire region of the phase space between this line and the upper line , @xmath105 , corresponds to long - range correlation when mapped into the biassed binary .",
    "this is so because the correlation parameter , @xmath33 , for the binary is related to @xmath150 and @xmath151 by the identity , @xmath152 which in turn implies a correspondence between the range @xmath153 of the ternary and the range @xmath154 of the biassed binary ; every line in between and parallel to the upper and lower lines in fig.1 is mapped into a point in the range @xmath154 and _ vice versa_. in particular , the shaded part of the ellipse in fig.1 is the diffusive area that is mapped into the superdiffusive regime of the biassed binary , which in general is characterized by a parameter , @xmath33 , in the range @xmath144 , -1 + [ 1/b])$ ] .",
    "conversely , the fact that the correlation parameter of the biassed binary sequence under study has a value in the range @xmath144 , -1 + [ 1/b])$ ] does not necessarily mean that the parent ternary sequence also has long - range correlations . even if we know",
    "_ a priori _ that there are long - range correlations between symbols of the parent sequence , the parameter @xmath33 is not a true measure of its strength .",
    "we have worked out the exact phase diagram for a ternary sequence with long - range correlation .",
    "motivated by the fact that the diffusive portion of the phase space is larger for the ternary than for the binary , we have studied the mapping between these two .",
    "we have shown that long - range correlation for the binary does not necessarily imply long - range correlation for the ternary .",
    "this exact result has deeper implications for the coarse - graining of many - alphabets sequences [ 8 ] .",
    "for example , if we do not know that the original sequence has long - range correlations or ( and ) if we do not know the coarse - graining procedure that has led to the representative sequence under study , then we may not be able to make accurate inferences about the correlation properties of the original sequence .",
    "a systematic numerical study of this problem will be reported elsewhere .",
    "it could be of interest to do a similar study for a non - markov sequence .",
