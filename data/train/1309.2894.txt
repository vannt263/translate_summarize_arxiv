    "the asymmetric simple inclusion process ( asip ) is a unidirectional lattice - gas flow model which was recently introduced @xcite as an ` inclusion ' counterpart of the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite . in both processes , random events",
    "cause particles to hop uni - directionally , from site to site , along a one - dimensional lattice . in the asep particles are subject to _ exclusion _ interactions that keep them singled apart , whereas in the asip particles are subject to _ inclusion _ interactions that coalesce them into inseparable particle clusters .",
    "the asip links together the asep with the tandem jackson network ( tjn ) @xcite  a fundamental service model in queueing theory . from a queueing perspective",
    ", the asip s ` gluing ' of particles into inseparable particle - clusters manifests unlimited ` batch service ' @xcite and the model can thus be understood as a tjn with this additional property . the asip is briefly described as follows .",
    "particles enter a lattice with rate @xmath0 at its leftmost site , and hop from one site to the next in clusters . in each hopping event the entire particle content of a site translocates as one to the next site and immediately coalesces with the particle content therein .",
    "the clusters continue to hop and coalesce with other clusters until they finally exit the lattice from its rightmost site .",
    "even the simplest asips  homogeneous asips , in which the hopping rates do not depend on the position along the lattice  were shown to display an intriguing showcase of complexity , including power law occupations statistics , diverse forms of self - similarity , and a rich limiting behavior @xcite . however ,",
    "several of the aforementioned ` complexity results ' relied only on monte - carlo studies , as an exact expression for the joint stationary probability distribution of particle occupations is not known .",
    "obtaining an exact , closed form , solution of the model is undoubtedly difficult , as coalescence introduces strong correlations between the occupations of different lattice sites . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an iterative scheme for the computation of the probability generating function ( pgf ) of this steady - state distribution was presented . and",
    "yet , the pgf turns out to be analytically tractable only for very small asips  a fact that is manifest in the rapid growth in its complexity as a function of lattice size @xcite .",
    "homogenous asips were nevertheless proven optimal with respect to various measures of efficiency @xcite thus further indicating their special importance .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present an exact closed - form expression for the probability that a given number of particles occupies a given set of consecutive lattice sites on an homogeneous asip lattice .",
    "these probabilities , which we term the incremental load probabilities ( to be defined precisely below ) , are marginals of the joint occupation distribution .",
    "progress can be made with their analysis by using the empty - interval method , a method which has proven useful in the study of aggregation in closed systems @xcite .",
    "the calculation of these probabilities in our open system is based on a combinatorial analysis of the incremental load and on the solution of a boundary value problem that governs its distribution .",
    "this approach yields exact , closed form , results expressed in terms of the entries of catalan s trapezoids @xcite  number arrays which generalize catalan s numbers and catalan s triangle @xcite .",
    "the incremental load probabilities provide valuable information on the asip steady state , and furnish an analytical proof for the numerical results obtained in @xcite . in particular , we prove that : ( i ) the probability that the @xmath1 lattice site is non - empty decays like @xmath2 ; ( ii ) the variance of the occupancy of the @xmath1 lattice site grows like @xmath3 ; and ( iii ) the asip s outflow is governed by rayleigh - distributed inter - exit times .",
    "thus , in this paper we present a substantial advance towards the exact solution of the asip model .    before presenting the exact expression for the incremental load probabilities ,",
    "we follow a complementary approach which is based on mapping the original problem onto its diffusion limit counterpart .",
    "this approach shows that the incremental load probabilities in lattice segments that are far away downstream have asymptotic scaling forms which we compute .",
    "some of these scaling forms were previously found in ref .",
    "@xcite using an alternative discrete approach . here",
    "we present a `` real - space '' analysis performed in a continuum limit .",
    "our analysis yields physical insight into the behavior of the model and allows us to derive some new asymptotic scaling forms .",
    "more importantly , the diffusion - limit approach reveals that the asymptotics of the incremental load probabilities are _ universal _ , in the sense that they do not depend on the details of the process which feeds particles into the asip lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model - description ] reviews the asip , as well as the motivation for introducing this model .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized in section [ sec : results - summary ] where we also introduce the notion of incremental load . in section [ sec : the - asip - as - a - coag ] the asip is described as a coagulation model and the empty - interval method is adapted to its analysis . in section [ sec : continuum - limit - of ] a continuum diffusion limit is carried out and asymptotic results are obtained ; various implications of these results are discussed in section [ sec : implications - of - the ] .",
    "section [ sec : incremental - load - analysis ] further deepens the probabilistic analysis of the incremental load , and the associated boundary - value problem . in this section",
    "we obtain expressions for the incremental load which may be efficiently computed even for inhomogeneous asips . in section [ sec : homogeneous - asips - exact ] we return to homogeneous systems , for which we solve the boundary value problem and obtain a set of exact , closed form , results .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper with an overview and future outlook .    a note about notation : throughout the paper * * @xmath4 * * and @xmath5 will denote , respectively , the mathematical expectation and variance of a real - valued random variable @xmath6 .",
    "in this section we briefly review the asip .",
    "this process was introduced and explored in @xcite and is described as follows . consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath7 sites indexed @xmath8 .",
    "each site is followed by a gate  labeled by the site s index  which controls the site s outflow .",
    "particles arrive at the first site ( @xmath9 following a poisson process @xmath10 with rate @xmath0 , the openings of gate @xmath11 are timed according to a poisson process @xmath12 with rate @xmath13 ( @xmath8 ) , and the @xmath14 poisson processes are mutually independent .",
    "note that from this definition it follows that the times between particle arrivals are independent and exponentially distributed with mean @xmath15 , and that the times between the openings of gate @xmath11 are independent and exponentially distributed with mean @xmath16 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "a key feature of the asip is its ` batch service ' property : at an opening of gate @xmath11 all particles present at site @xmath11 transit simultaneously , and in one batch ( one cluster ) , to site @xmath17  thus joining particles that may already be present at site @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . at an opening of the last gate ( @xmath19 ) all particles present at site",

    "the asip s dynamics can be schematically summarized as follows : ( i ) first site ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 ( ii ) interior sites @xmath23 : @xmath24 ( iii ) last site ( @xmath19 ) : @xmath25 throughout most of the paper we focus on homogeneous asips . in this subclass of asips , the rates @xmath26",

    "two of the simplest models of this kind are the coalescence - diffusion model @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents an occupied site and @xmath30 represents an empty site , and the aggregation - diffusion model @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents a site occupied by @xmath33 particles , and @xmath30 represents an empty site @xcite . in both eqs .",
