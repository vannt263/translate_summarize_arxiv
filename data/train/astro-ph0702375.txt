    "the high - luminosity wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are characterised by bright emission line spectra produced in hot , high - speed stellar winds @xcite . thought to embody the final stable stage in the evolution of very massive stars , they are candidate precursors to type ib / ic supernovae @xcite . the fast ( @xmath11kms@xmath12 ) stellar winds of wr stars are responsible for prodigious mass loss ( @xmath13m@xmath5yr@xmath12 ) , eventually stripping the star of its outer layers and forming their characteristic he - rich emission - line spectrum .",
    "despite the ephemeral nature of this phase , these stars are important not only for understanding the evolution of massive stars but also as tracers of galactic structure and star formation @xcite .",
    "the double - lined spectroscopic binary @xmath0  velorum ( hr 3207 , hd 68273 , wr 11 ) contains the brightest example of the wr type in the sky and has a combined visual magnitude @xmath14 with an o - star companion .",
    "it has a _ hipparcos _ determined distance of @xmath15pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , placing @xmath0  vel closer to earth than any other wr star by a factor of approximately two ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its proximity is not the only reason that it is a key target for astronomers : the orbital motion of the two stars makes @xmath0  vel one of the few systems for which a direct mass determination of the components can be achieved . as such",
    ", @xmath0 vel provides critical tests for the theory of wr and massive star evolution .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that numerous studies of this system have been made , but in spite of its seemingly textbook status , considerable uncertainties remain .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of @xmath0  vel has been hampered by entanglement of the o - star and wr wind emission : all absorption features of the brighter o - star component are blended with emission lines from the wr wind @xcite .",
    "accounting for the wr emission is not trivial because _ a ) _ multiple emission lines may contribute to the blend , _ b ) _ the shape of the emission line may differ significantly from a gaussian , _",
    "c ) _ the emission lines vary in time with some excess emission attributed to wind - wind collision phenomena , _ d ) _ the extended wings of the strong o - star absorption are lost in the blend ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this has resulted in numerous luminosity and spectral class identifications of the o - star in the literature : o7.5 @xcite , o8 @xcite , o9  i @xcite , o8  iii @xcite and o7.5  iii  v @xcite.the wr component has retained its original classification of type wc8 by @xcite .    the first to determine the period and some of the orbital elements by radial velocity measurements were @xcite .",
    "further spectroscopic studies , for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , continued to add to our knowledge of the system but discrepancies could not be resolved and observations from the _ iue _ could _ ` only be seen as muddying some already murky waters ' _ @xcite . by correcting the o - star absorption lines due to the wr emission , @xcite believe they have the most definitive spectroscopic orbit to date .",
    "however , this type of analysis can not determine all of the orbital elements .",
    "for example , the inclination has been estimated from the polarimetric analysis of @xcite and further constraints were imposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who used the _ hipparcos _ distance , stellar models and spectroscopy .    due to",
    "the high angular resolution needed , only interferometric techniques can currently be employed to accurately constrain the remaining orbital parameters . however , the southerly declination ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath0  vel places it out of reach for many interferometers of sufficient resolving power .",
    "@xcite used the narrabri stellar intensity interferometer ( nsii ) to study this system , determining the angular semi - major axis to be @xmath17mas .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise of their observations necessitated the adoption of the parameters of @xcite which have now been superseded by those of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the lack of observations , the inclination could not be adequately constrained and a value @xmath18 was assumed from theoretical arguments .",
    "the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) has observed @xmath0  vel and produced a single angular separation and position angle @xcite but has yet to improve the orbital parameters .",
    "reliance on distance estimations and stellar models has paved the way for further analysis of fundamental parameters , although this path has been fraught with controversy .",
    "the pre-_hipparcos _ distance of @xmath0  vel was inferred from the assumed membership of the vela ob2 association or from statistical absolute magnitudes of similar or nearby stars .",
    "@xcite assumed equidistance with the visual companion @xmath19  vel while @xcite adopted 460pc from estimates of nearby stars .",
    "the interferometric study of @xcite combined with the spectroscopy of @xcite produced the first dynamical parallax of this system yielding @xmath20pc , although this distance is affected by the assumed values of some orbital parameters . in the 1980s ,",
    "the distance to @xmath0  vel was assumed to be equal to that of the vela ob2 association ( 450pc ) with sufficient certainty as to be used in the determination of galactic wr intrinsic parameters @xcite .",
    "the publication of the significantly different _ hipparcos _ parallax distance of @xmath15pc by @xcite and @xcite caused a critical reassessment of all @xmath0  vel parameters that are distance dependent  the absolute magnitude of the components , the spectral class of the o - star primary , the mass - loss of the wr star etc .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "distance has been challenged by the discovery of a low - mass , pre - main - sequence stellar association in the direction of @xmath0  vel and the vela ob2 association .",
    "@xcite argue these low - mass stars are associated with @xmath0  vel and approximately coeval at a distance consistent with earlier estimates of 360490pc .",
    "the single measurement by the vlti has yielded a measure of the distance to @xmath0  vel of @xmath21pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) placing the system farther from the _ hipparcos _ distance and closer to the vela ob2 association .    in section",
    "[ fit ] we provide the first complete orbital solution for @xmath0  vel determined by long - baseline optical interferometry . in combination with the latest radial velocity measurements , the tightly constrained distance , spatial scale and mass of the components",

    "there is good agreement between our values and those derived from recent spectral analysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the o - star is consistent with a giant using the ` spectroscopic ' calibration of @xcite but is a little low compared to the values of @xcite . a possible explanation for the higher value of @xcite is given in @xcite who note that evolutionary models produce masses systematically higher than spectroscopic models ( the evolutionary model analysis in section  [ ostar ] also produced a higher mass : @xmath25m@xmath5 ) . with the tables of @xcite",
    "the o - star mass is consistent with the ` theoretical ' giant mass but is slightly high for the ` observed ' giant mass . therefore our proposed luminosity classification of ii ",
    "iii is also supported by our observed mass and o - star calibrations in the literature .",
    "the mass of the wr star determined with the mass - luminosity relationship given by equation 3 of @xcite is 9.2m@xmath5 ( using the estimated @xmath26(wr)@xmath27 from section  [ wrstar ] ) which is in good agreement with our mass value . in the catalogue of @xcite",
    "there are 6 wc stars that have reliable masses and range from 916m@xmath5 with a mean of @xmath28m@xmath5 , consistent with our value .    the mass and @xmath29(wr ) we have determined",
    "can be used to check our choice of bc in section  [ wrstar ] . using fig .",
    "4 of @xcite , our mass and @xmath29 produces a point that lies above the -4.5 bc line but is lower than the wc7 and wc9 points .",
    "this implies a bolometric correction between -3.5 and -4.5 , justifying our choice of -4.0 from the atmospheric analysis of wr135 .",
    "previous observational mass - loss estimates of the wr star require adjustment using our distances and revised parameters before turning to a comparison with the expected values from theory .",
    "the mass - loss derived from radio continuum at 4.8ghz of @xcite with the wind velocity @xmath30kms@xmath12 from @xcite and corrected for nonthermal emission by @xcite is @xmath31m@xmath5yr@xmath12 .",
    "this is in agreement with the average radio - derived mass - loss rate of wc89 stars of @xmath32m@xmath5yr@xmath12 determined by @xcite .",
    "the polarimetric mass - loss of @xcite has been given more attention due to the improved orbital parameters from the interferometric orbit .",
    "as described in section  [ pol ] , we reanalysed the polarimetric data of @xcite but restricted all orbital parameters to the values given in table  [ fit_table ] to obtain @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to a polarisation amplitude near periastron of @xmath36 . once again using @xmath30kms@xmath12 and @xcite the polarimetric mass - loss is found to be @xmath37m@xmath5yr@xmath12 .",
    "the disparity of the radio and polarimetric measurements can be attributed to density variations or clumping in the wr wind @xcite .",
    "clumping affects the radio mass - loss as it assumes a smooth wind and is proportional to the wind density squared . on the other hand ,",
    "polarimetric mass - loss is proportional to the density and is therefore insensitive to clumping ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the above radio and polarimetric mass - loss gives an estimate of a clumping factor @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite predict a value of @xmath39 and the value for the single wc analysed by @xcite is @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite re - estimated @xmath41m@xmath5yr@xmath12 and used the _ hipparcos _",
    "@xmath42 of @xcite to find @xmath43 in the order of 4 .",
    "the consistency with our value is a fortuitous accident of the polarimetric mass - loss changing by a small amount and the radio mass - loss remaining unchanged at @xmath44m@xmath5yr@xmath12  the removal of the nonthermal component in the radio flux negated the revision of the distance .",
    "theoretical mass - loss rates for a 9m@xmath5 ( smooth stellar wind ) wr are @xmath45m@xmath5yr@xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the clumping - corrected , chemical composition dependent relationship of @xcite",
    "we also find @xmath46m@xmath5yr@xmath12 .",
    "these values are consistent within errors of both our mass - loss estimates .",
    "further comparison can be made to the detailed modeling of @xmath0  vel by @xcite with the use of a clumping volume filling factor @xmath47 .",
    "our clumping factor @xmath43 is related to @xmath47 by @xmath48 @xcite i.e. @xmath49 and gives @xmath50m@xmath5yr@xmath12 in agreement with our polarimetric mass - loss rate .    the wr wind performance or transfer efficiency @xmath51 represents the ratio of radial momentum in the stellar wind to the radiation momentum and is @xmath52 for winds that are within the single - scattering limit for a radiatively driven flow @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have shown @xmath53 is possible for winds that are radiatively driven with multiple - scattering effects . a typical value of @xmath53 is given in @xcite while @xcite approximate @xmath54 for @xmath0  vel assuming a 10% clumping volume filling factor . the wind performance , using our polarimetric mass - loss and luminosity with @xmath30 kms@xmath12 from @xcite , is @xmath55 ; consistent with values where multiple - scattering effects drive the wr wind and mass - loss @xcite",
    "we present the first complete orbital solution for @xmath0 vel based on interferometric measurements with susi .",
    "emission line contamination has been simply modeled and found not to affect the orbital solution .    in combination with the latest radial velocity measurements , the dynamical parallax and distance to @xmath0  vel",
    "have been revised .",
    "the constraints we have placed on the galactic location of @xmath0  vel are the tightest to date by an order of magnitude and membership of @xmath0  vel in the vela ob2 association has been confirmed .",
    "the contrast between our distance and previous measurements in the literature is such that all distance - dependent fundamental parameters require revision e.g. absolute magnitudes , mass - loss rates .",
    "moreover , the formal uncertainty in the distance can now be included in the determination of fundamental parameters .    using calibrations found in the literature , the radius , absolute visual magnitude and mass of the component o - star are consistent with a luminosity classification of ii  iii . the age that we have estimated for the o - star falls at the centre of the 26 myr range estimated by @xcite for the nearby population of low - mass , pre - main sequence stars , implying coeval formation with @xmath0  vel .",
    "we have shown that the narrow - band absolute visual magnitude and mass of the wc8 component is consistent with other galactic wr stars of similar type and theoretical mass - luminosity relationships .",
    "the mass - loss rates determined by radio and polarimetric measurements have been revised to include new information in the literature and our orbital parameters .",
    "these values allowed an estimation of the clumping volume filling factor which is used to show agreement between recent atmospheric model analysis and our clumping insensitive mass - loss rate .",
