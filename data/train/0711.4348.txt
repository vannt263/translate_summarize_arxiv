    "the unique system ss  433 is an x - ray binary star that falls in the class of microquasars @xcite .",
    "the system exhibits relativistic jets originating from a compact object surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "the companion star in the system contributes only a small fraction of the total light and is thus difficult to detect . because the accretion disk and its wind are the dominant source of light in the system ,",
    "reasonable measurements have been made of the radial velocity amplitude of the compact object ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models of the precessing jets and eclipses have also provided a very accurate system inclination ( 788 , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , identifying the mass donor and accurately determining its radial velocity amplitude will lead to direct kinematical masses for both components .",
    "the first potential observations of the mass donor star were reported by @xcite with additional observations published later by @xcite .",
    "these studies detected faint absorption lines present in blue spectra of ss  433 that exhibited the doppler shifts expected for the donor star .",
    "finding these lines is difficult , not only due to the small relative flux contribution of the a - star , but also to the active emission spectrum from the accretion disk , jets , and strong disk wind in the system .",
    "the most convincing observations to date of the mass donor spectrum were obtained by @xcite .",
    "their spectra suggested that the donor star has a spectral classification of a37  i , and their radial velocity measurements led to component masses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( where the subscripts represent the optical companion star _ o _ and the x - ray emitting compact object _ x _ ) .",
    "this identification of the mass donor star was challenged by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors present spectra of ss  433 that show features found in an a - supergiant , but that do not follow a coherent orbital radial velocity curve .",
    "their observations show a larger scatter , were performed over a greater variety of orbital and precessional phases , and have a much lower average velocity than those presented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that these a - supergiant absorption lines arise in an accretion - driven outflow .",
    "thus , their work demonstrates that not all the absorption features in the spectrum of ss  433 form in the photosphere of the mass donor star .",
    "some of the differences between these investigations are due to the timing of the observations and the inherent time variability of the spectrum . given the relative faintness of the mass donor star compared to the super - eddington disk in the system , @xcite planned observations for orbital phases when the disk is partially eclipsed and for precessional phases when the donor star appears above the disk plane at orbital inferior conjunction .",
    "this strategy maximizes the opportunity to reduce the glare of the disk and avoid obscuration by the extensive disk gas . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite made observations at a variety of other orbital and precessional phases and made plausibility arguments that the donor star spectrum might appear at some of these ( but was not in fact detected ) .",
    "given the need to resolve the differing interpretations in the papers of @xcite and @xcite , we undertook follow - up observations to repeat the observations of @xcite .",
    "if the absorption features identified do originate in a disk outflow , then the highly variable nature of the outflow in ss  433 suggests that repeat observations will show significant scatter from prior observations , if in fact the absorption features are still present .",
    "however , if the absorption lines originate from the mass donor star , then the highly stable and periodic nature of the orbit should produce observations consistent with the data of @xcite .",
    "observations were acquired with gmos on the gemini north telescope on ut 2006 june 713 .",
    "the resulting spectra cover the wavelength range 37675227   with a dispersion of 0.235   pixel@xmath4 and resolution @xmath5 .",
    "observations were made for approximately four hours each night , and all the individual spectra from each night were coadded to improve the s / n .",
    "the coadded spectra were shifted to a heliocentric frame and continuum normalized by fitting regions free of strong emission lines .",
    "the observations were timed to correspond to mid - eclipse and greatest disk opening angle , as with the data from @xcite . the spectra cover orbital phase @xmath6 and precessional phase @xmath7 , according to the orbital ephemeris of @xcite , @xmath8 and , for disk precession , the model ephemeris of @xcite , @xmath9 the orbital phase coverage overlaps with and extends that of @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectra from seven consecutive nights around mid - eclipse show the expected broad `` stationary '' emission lines .",
    "the brightest emission lines of hydrogen and helium all showed strong p cygni absorption components every night except on the fourth and last nights of the run .",
    "the h@xmath10 jet line was present in the spectra , but weak .",
    "the new series of spectra appear to show considerably more emission contamination in the range @xmath1145004625   than seen at the time of the investigation by @xcite , and consequently , it was not possible to measure unambiguously the same set of absorption lines they analyzed",
    ". the only clearly problem free regions larger than @xmath12    in the observed spectral range are the intervals of @xmath1147504830   and @xmath1149504985  .",
    "these regions show clear absorption features in the spectra .",
    "an interesting case is that of night seven , in which the only visible absorption features are interstellar in origin .",
    "their clear appearance in that spectrum allowed us to subtract the interstellar absorption from the spectra obtained on the first six nights .",
    "this was especially helpful near 4762 and 4780   where interstellar lines overlapped apparent stellar absorption features .",
    "the resulting , interstellar - subtracted , and normalized spectra of ss  433 in the wavelength region described above are shown in figure [ spec ] along with a spectrum of an a - supergiant , hd  9233 ( a4  iab ) .",
    "the hd  9233 spectrum was obtained in 2005 august with the medium resolution spectrograph ( mrs ) on the university of texas hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "it has been smoothed to match the resolution of the ss  433 spectra and intensity scaled to match the mid - eclipse line depth as described below .",
    "a comparison of the interstellar spectrum of ss  433 from night seven with that of hd  9233 shows that the latter has no appreciable interstellar absorption .",
    "we confirm that the the lines of an a - type supergiant absorption spectrum are once again present in the spectrum of ss  433 .",
    "line identifications for major absorption lines are also shown in figure [ spec ] .",
    "all the spectra in the figure are doppler - shifted to the heliocentric rest frame .",
    "the ss  433 spectra were shifted using the radial velocity values discussed below .",
    "the hd  9233 spectrum was shifted using a measured heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath13 km s@xmath4 , significantly different than the value of @xmath14 km s@xmath4 given by @xcite .",
    "it is likely that hd  9233 is a radial velocity variable .",
    "we measured radial velocities for the absorption lines in the ss  433 spectra using the same method applied by @xcite , i.e. , by calculating cross - correlating functions ( ccfs ) of the absorption line regions in each ss  433 spectrum with those in the spectrum of hd  9233 .",
    "the spectrum of hd  9233 was first rescaled in intensity to match the absorption features of the mid - eclipse spectrum of ss  433 . the scaling factor found in @xcite of @xmath15 was also found to be appropriate for this data .",
    "we then added the radial velocity of hd  9233 to the relative velocities from cross - correlation to transform them to an absolute scale .",
    "the resulting heliocentric radial velocities for ss  433 are given in table [ rvel ] and are plotted as a function of orbital phase in figure [ ss433rv ] ( together with the radial velocity measurements from @xcite for comparison ) .",

    "if this line might be consistently offset from the full sample ccf values , and thus offset the night six radial velocity value , a ccf fit was run using just this line .",
    "the resulting radial velocity and ccf amplitude results for nights 16 were well within the individual error ranges of the full ccf fits and there were no apparent systematic differences .",
    "the absorption lines shown in figure [ spec ] appear to be strongest near mid - eclipse ( phase 0.0 ) when the flux dilution from the disk light is minimized .",
    "this variation in strength is represented in figure [ ccf ] by the relative ccf amplitudes for the 2006 june gemini north data , along with those from @xcite .",
    "the solid line in this figure shows the predicted variation in strength for a constant flux component that is diluted by the phase - variable flux contribution from the disk .",
    "this function was derived from the schematic @xmath18-band light curve of @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "since the disk flux varies stochastically , the actual eclipse light curve during the time of the 2006 june observations may have differed from this prediction .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the absorption lines did strengthen and weaken as expected during this particular eclipse .",
    "@xcite discuss three criteria that must be met if the absorption line pattern is to be reliably associated with the supergiant : ( 1 ) the radial velocity variation with orbital phase should appear with the ascending branch centered at orbital phase 0.0 ( i.e. , at inferior conjunction at the time of the optical and x - ray mid - eclipse ) .",
    "furthermore , the systemic velocity should be approximately the same as that of the nebula ( @xmath19 to @xmath20 km  s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the new radial velocity data ( fig .",
    "[ ss433rv ] ) agree with these predictions and with the earlier radial velocity measurements .",
    "( 2 ) the absorption line depths will usually be weak and modulated in strength by the orbital curve and precessional phase .",
    "the observed spectrum is a composite of disk and stellar light , so that the stellar lines will always be diluted by the continuum flux from the disk .",
    "furthermore , the accretion disk is probably optically thick and vertically extended , so the supergiant will often be hidden when the star is behind the disk plane from our line of sight .",
    "the new spectra show the same variation in absorption line strength ( fig .",
    "[ ccf ] ) as found previously by @xcite , consistent with our expectations for the varying supergiant to disk flux ratio . ( 3 ) the presence of a super - eddington disk in ss 433 implies that the system is undergoing rapid mass transfer from an evolved and roche - filling mass donor . the fact that the absorption line spectrum resembles that of an a - supergiant with a projected rotational line broadening that matches expectations for a roche - filling star in synchronous rotation @xcite is fully consistent with the mass transfer picture .",
    "all three criteria are met in the new observations , and the remarkably consistent agreement between the new results and those of @xcite strongly support the conclusion that the absorption pattern in the spectrum of ss  433 observed near mid - eclipse and precessional phase zero is that of the mass donor star . on the other hand , the behavior of an absorption spectral component associated with a disk or disk wind will be highly time variable , and we suspect that the kind of absorption features described by @xcite and @xcite do originate in a disk outflow as they propose .",
    "the radial velocity curve also provides us with the opportunity to revise the kinematical mass calculations for each component .",
    "the best - fit radial velocity curve for the combined sets of data shown in figure [ ss433rv ] gives a semiamplitude for the mass donor star of @xmath21 km s@xmath4 and a systemic velocity of @xmath22 km s@xmath4 . adopting a compact object semiamplitude of @xmath23 km s@xmath4 ( see * ? ? ? * ) and system inclination of @xmath24 @xcite gives component masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the larger revised mass for the compact object establishes it much more firmly as a black hole candidate . the derived mass ratio @xmath27 is consistent with limits from the optical @xcite and x - ray @xcite light curves .",
    "we caution that our estimate of @xmath28 may differ from the actual geometric value if the inner hemisphere of the a - supergiant is significantly heated by flux from the disk @xcite .",
    "the amount of irradiation present is very uncertain since the disk vertical extensions may be sufficient to block most of the high energy radiation from the central accretion zone from reaching the facing hemisphere of the supergiant .",
    "furthermore , the effects of such heating on line formation are complicated .",
    "for example , a hotter , brighter inner hemisphere will have a center of light that is shifted towards the companion ( so that the measured radial velocity shifts would be less than actual ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the temperature is high enough in the irradiated hemisphere to shift the plasma to higher ionization stages or to reduce the temperature gradient in the atmosphere , then the lines we observe would be weaker or absent in the surface elements of the inner hemisphere ( shifting the measured radial velocities to larger than actual ) .",
    "the clues from the available spectra suggest that irradiation probably plays a minor role since the decline in ccf strength following mid - eclipse follows approximately the expected curve for flux dilution alone ( fig .",
    "[ ccf ] ) .",
    "however , the absorption lines do weaken and disappear in the final spectrum obtained near orbital quadrature phase , and this behavior may be due to some contribution of irradiation or the disappearance of the supergiant behind an optically thick accretion disk . if irradiation of the inner hemisphere were to change the ionization stage , however , then at quadrature the absorption lines would be visible from only half of the projected stellar surface , meaning the line strengths should be no greater than half that predicted by the eclipse model ( _ solid line _ ) in figure [ ccf ] .",
    "we have shown that the behavior of the a - supergiant absorption spectrum observed in ss  433 during eclipse and near precessional phase zero is repeatable .",
    "this suggests that the origin of the spectrum is a consistent , well - behaved source .",
    "we suggest that the source is the mass donor star in the system rather than the disk or a disk wind .",
    "it is interesting that ss  433 would show such similar spectra from both the mass donor star and the disk / disk wind .",
    "however , the appearance of such absorption might be anticipated if the disk outflow material is clumpy and has a temperature in the line forming region comparable to that of the supergiant .",
    "the radial velocity curve resulting from observations of the mass donor star then allow calculations of the kinematical masses of the two components .",
    "we find masses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the mass donor and compact object .",
    "it is possible that the inner hemisphere of the mass donor is irradiated , which would change the mass of both components , potentially reducing the compact object mass to below the neutron star limit .",
    "the behavior of the ccf amplitude suggests that a strong irradiation effect is not present in the data presented here .",
    "if this is the case , then the compact object in ss  433 can be firmly identified as a black hole candidate .",
