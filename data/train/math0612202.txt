    "a great variety of phenomena in physics and engineering can be modelled in the form of matrix - differential equations . although linear matrix - differential equations , whose numerical solutions using cubic matrix splines were presented in  @xcite , are valid for a wide range of applications , non - linear equations are also of great interest . this work generalizes the approach of  @xcite , providing a novel scheme to numerically solve non - linear differential matrix equations of the first - order . concretely , in this work we will develop a method for the numerical integration of the first order matrix differential equation given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 \\times { \\mathbb c}^{r \\times q } \\mapsto { \\mathbb c}^{r \\times q}$ ] . + different examples of problem ( [ problem ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
