    "this recentering corrects for differential atmospheric refraction .    for the other two objects , there are no stars in the vimos field of view .",
    "we used the information on the spatial shifts contained in the image headers to apply the corresponding shifts .",

    "for this reason , we used the ly@xmath1 peak of emission to recenter all cubes .",
    "although this recentering is valid in the blue , it is not clear that it is also valid in the red . in particular , in the case of mrc 1558 - 003 , we found a residual spatial shift of @xmath81 spaxel in the direction of the radio structures between the blue ( ly@xmath1 ) and red ( civ , heii ) parts of the spectrum , which is much larger than found in previous works ( villar - martn et al .",

    "an additional correction was applied .",

    "although the accuracy of the spatial centering between the red and the blue ends of the spectrum is uncertain , this will not affect the results presented here , due to the nature of our analysis and the clear separation between the spatial components of the ly@xmath1 nebula .",
    "the cubes were then combined using iraf tasks , masking the broken and/or low sensitivity fibres .",
    "a 3@xmath30 clipping algorithm removed cosmic rays .",
    "the sky background was estimated before subtraction by selecting the spectra of object free areas and creating an interpolated datacube ( using e3d , snchez @xcite ) . a spatial median smoothing using a 4x4 spaxel box",
    "was applied .",

    "observations of standard stars were used to perform a relative calibration from blue to red .",
    "the absolute flux calibration for mrc 1558 - 003 and mrc 2025 - 218 was done using available keck long - slit spectroscopy along the radio axis .",

    "the flux in different spectral windows was then compared and scaled .",
    "the final flux calibration has an accuracy of @xmath820% . for mrc 0140 - 257 ,",
    "this could not be done , due to the unavailability of a high quality long - slit spectrum , but as we explain in  5.3 , the agreement between the measured ly@xmath1 flux and published values is reasonably good ( @xmath820% ) .",

    "@xcite ) on the ly@xmath1 images , a different method was used for each object depending on the information available in the data . for mrc 2025 - 218",
    ", we placed the radio core at the position of the continuum centroid in the vimos data .",
    "since this is a broad line object (  3.2 ) , it is reasonable to expect that this marks the location of the active nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that the uv continuum has an spatially unresolved component (  3.2 ) .    for mrc 1558 - 003",
    ", we positioned the radio core at the spaxel with the maximum ly@xmath1 flux , which is expected to be shifted by a few tenths of a spaxel relative to the continuum centroid ( humphrey et al .",
    "this method would be incorrect if the agn is spatially shifted relative to the continuum and/or line centroids .",
    "however , we do not expect this to be the case since this is a broad line object and moreover , it shows little evidence for ly@xmath1 absorption ( see below ) .",
    "the 1@xmath30 uncertainty in the ly@xmath1-radio registration is @xmath80.3 \" in both cases .    for mrc 0140 - 257",
    ", we assumed that the radio core is placed between the two ly@xmath1 spatial components , although it is not necessarily the case .",
    "this is the main source of uncertainty since the radio core could be shifted by 2@xmath29 if it is associated with one of the two ly@xmath1 blobs (  4.3 ) .",
    "the impact of this assumption on the interpretation of our results will be discussed when relevant .",
    "the main scientific goal of our vimos - vlt observational program is to study the properties of the giant nebulae associated with a sample of hzrg . by isolating spectroscopically and/or spatially the emission from the perturbed and the quiescent gaseous components ( e.g. villar - martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , one of our priorities is to characterize the morphological , kinematic and ionization properties of the quiescent gas . in this way we can study the gas without the strong distortions that the radio structures can imprint on its observed properties .",
    "such study has the potential to provide critical information on the star formation and chemical enrichment histories as well as the galaxy formation process ( villar - martn et al .",
    "@xcite , humphrey et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in order to achieve these goals , it is critical to detect the main uv lines ( very especially lya and heii ) with high signal / noise in the faint , outer regions of the objects , which are usually characterized by quiescent kinematics .",
    "moreover , this would allow to study in detail the high surface brightness regions ( at least several times brighter ) .",
    "although usually distorted by the radio structures , it should be possible to isolate spectroscopically the emission from the quiescent and the perturbed gas using especially the non resonant heii line , as villar - martn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the faintest regions of our interest have often ly@xmath1 surface brightness levels which are , within the errors , consistent with or even below the detection limit or our vimos data ( 3@xmath3110@xmath32 erg s@xmath7 @xmath33 arcsec@xmath34 ) for 8 - 10 hours exposure time . for comparison , van ojik et al .",

    "not even ly@xmath1 could be definitively detected from the faintest regions of our interest , which at least in mrc 1558 - 003 and mrc 2025 - 218 we knew exist (  3 ) . heii and civ are detected only from the highest surface brightness regions , but with not enough signal / noise ratio to perform an adequate kinematic and ionization analysis in two spatial dimensions .",
    "thus , the investigation of the properties of the quiescent gas has been possible only for those objects where there is no signature of interactions between the radio structures and the gas ( mrc 1558 - 003 and mrc 0140 - 257 , see  4 ) or objects with no spectroscopic blend between the perturbed and the quiescent nebula ( mrc 2104 - 242 , villar - martn et al .",

    "resonant scattering of ly@xmath1 photons has been ignored in our model because the gas within the cones is highly ionized and likely optically thin to ly@xmath1 ( see appendix  a ) . although resonant scattering effects could explain the large ly@xmath1 fwhm values , and its broader profile compared with heii (  4.1 ) , they would contradict other observational results .",
    "@xcite have performed radiative transfer calculations through neutral collapsing gas clouds and found that resonant scattering does not only broaden the ly@xmath1 line , but that energy transfer from the infalling gas to the ly@xmath1 photons shifts the line to bluer wavelengths . on the contrary , the observations suggest that the ly@xmath1 line is redshifted with respect to other emission lines and probably relative to the system s redshift .",
    "neither does resonant scattering through optically thick , collapsing , gas clouds reproduce the observation that the ly@xmath1 line is redshifted more towards the center .",
    "if resonant scattering does not occur , then it remains to be explained why ly@xmath1 shows such large fwhm values and it is much broader than heii .",
    "an alternative mechanism that can broaden ly@xmath1 relative to other emission lines and could produce a similar velocity pattern as that of infall is outflows ( dijkstra , haiman & spaans @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a shell propagates outwards from the center , which is thick enough to be self - shielding ( with column densities of hydrogen of 10@xmath63 @xmath33 ) .",
    "all material is highly ionized , except inside the shell that is moving outwards . in this case ,",
    "ly@xmath1 photons basically bounce off the shell as if it were a mirror , scattering back and forth between the two expanding mirrors until they have been doppler boosted far enough for them to be able to simply propagate through the shell ( each time a lya photon scatters off the shell , it picks up a doppler shift from the shell ) .",
    "this process will broaden ly@xmath1 , not affecting the other emission lines .",
    "detailed modeling would be necessary to test whether outflows can reproduce all other observed properties of the nebula as infall does .",
    "however , since outflows can not explain the radio / optical asymmetries seen in mrc 1558 - 003 ( humphrey et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which on the other hand , are successfully explained with infall , here we will not explore the outflows scenario further .    in conclusion",
    ", our infall model can explain successfully the morphology , size , surface brightness distribution and the velocity field of the ly@xmath1 nebula associated with mrc 1558 - 003 .",
    "it can also explain why ly@xmath1 is redshifted relative to other emission lines and the fwhm values of the non resonant heii line .",
    "the infall scenario is also consistent with our previous results which imply that the _ quiescent _ nebulae in many hzrg ( and mrc 1558 - 003 in particular ) are infalling ( humphrey et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , this model fails to explain the large ly@xmath1 fwhm values .",
    "a mechanism which might not be connected with the infall process could be responsible for the line broadening ) , while keeping the infall pattern and the heii fwhm intact .    _",
    "mrc 2025 - 218 _    it is not possible to investigate the kinematic pattern of the quiescent gas , since the data do not allow to isolate its emission in the ne component .",
    "_ mrc 0140 - 257 _    it is not possible to disentangle how the quiescent gas is moving in this object .",
    "the relaxed kinematics is not suggestive of outflows .",
    "mrc 0140 - 257 does not follow the trend found by humphrey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in powerful radio galaxies at different @xmath13 , such that the quiescent gas has the highest redshift at the side of the brightest and more polarized radio hot spot .",
    "the authors interpret these results as evidence for infall . on the contrary , the highest redshift in mrc 0140 - 257",
    "is measured in @xmath48 , at the side of the fainter ( northern ) radio hotspot .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to three different reasons : ( i ) the orientation diagnostics based on the radio properties is not valid ( ii ) the gas is not in infall ( iii ) our radio - optical registration (  2 ) is incorrect . if the radio core was located on @xmath48 or @xmath49 ( rather than between the two ly@xmath1 components ) , we would have no information on the redshift on one side of the nucleus .",
    "the interpretation of infall by humphrey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is based on the fact that the radio asymmetries in their sample provide a powerful diagnostic tool to constrain the orientation of the radio source ( and the ly@xmath1 nebula as a consequence ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the mrc 0140 - 257 discrepancy is that in this particular case the radio properties are not reliable indicators of the object orientation .",
    "this is actually suggested by the fact that the brightest ( southern ) hot spot shows the lowest polarization ( carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ) , contrary to what we would expect if both flux and polarization asymmetries where mostly determined by orientation .",
    "the orientation diagnostics based on the radio properties would fail , for instance , when the radio axis is very close to the plane of the sky . for mrc 0140 - 257 , on the contrary , the detection of a radio core ( carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ) rather suggests that the angle between the radio axis and the plane of the sky is not negligible .",
    "the diagnostics would also fail if the radio asymmetries are a consequence of environmental effects ( e.g. mccarthy , van breugel & kapahi @xcite ) , rather than orientation .",
    "this is possibly the case in mrc 0140 - 257 . on one hand , the brightest",
    ", less polarized hotspot is closest to the nucleus , and the ly@xmath64 emission on that side of the nucleus ( adopting our present radio - optical registration ) is also brightest .",
    "this is what we expect from mccarthy , van breugel & kapahi ( @xcite ) environmental scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "the southern ( brighter ) radio structure consists of two radio hot spots ( fig.8 ) . if this is due to a interactions with the gas ( e.g. carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ) , this process would enhance the radio emission and the higher brightness of the southern radio structure would therefore be a consequence of environmental effects .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the ly@xmath1 nebula is not infalling towards the center . @xmath48 and @xmath49 could be two objects rotating around a common center of mass ( e.g. de breuck et al .",
    "if this is located between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we estimate a dynamical mass of @xmath03@xmath65 m@xmath17 for a radius @xmath66=16 kpc and a projected rotation velocity of 60 km s@xmath7 ( i.e. half of the @xmath42 value between @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "this mass value is at least a factor of 100 smaller than the stellar masses inferred for other hzrg ( seymour et al .",
    "@xcite , villar - martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) or for massive , early - type galaxies at @xmath22 in deep , ir surveys ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "mrc 0140 - 257 could be an unusually small mass hzrg , a possibility that is also suggested by the small fwhm values measured in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it would be essential to obtain rest frame h and k magnitudes ( e.g. seymour et al .",
    "@xcite , villar - martn et al .",
    "@xcite ) to make a proper estimation of the stellar mass .",
    "if , on the contrary , this is progenitor of a massive elliptical galaxy , as one expects for a powerful hzrg ( e.g. mclure et al .",
