    "the theory calculations are computed consistently for all data sets using recent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and common choices for the strong coupling constant @xmath7 and the renormalization and factorization scales",
    ". ratios of data and theory are presented as a function of jet transverse momentum . throughout this article",
    "we use @xmath1 to refer to both , either the jet transverse momentum or the jet transverse energy , as appropriate . in hadron - hadron collisions",
    ", `` transverse '' refers to the momentum or energy component perpendicular to the hadron - hadron beam axis . in dis ,",
    "`` transverse '' refers to the momentum component perpendicular to the photon - proton axis ( which is the @xmath8-axis in the breit frame ) . ]",
    "@xmath1 or , alternatively , as a function of the scaling variable @xmath2 .",
    "this article is intended as a persistent repository for the newest theory - data comparisons possible in jet production in hadron - induced processes and will be updated whenever new relevant data and/or theory results are published .    in section 2",
    "we discuss how the theory results are obtained while details of the data sets are described in section 3 .",
    "comparisons of theory and data are presented in section 4 .",
    "conventionally , experimental measurements are corrected for instrumental effects and the results are provided at the `` particle level ''  @xcite .",
    "corresponding theory predictions for jet observables @xmath9 are therefore obtained as the product of a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) result , @xmath10 , multiplied by a correction factor for non - perturbative effects , @xmath11 @xmath12 for inclusive jet cross sections in hadron - hadron collision and in dis , the fixed - order perturbative expansion is known to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath13 , which is of order @xmath14 for dis and @xmath15 for hadron - hadron collisions . for inclusive jet cross sections in hadron - hadron collisions , additional @xmath16 corrections from threshold corrections",

    "the proton pdfs are taken from the pdf parametrizations mstw2008",
    "@xcite , ct10  @xcite , nnpdf2.1  @xcite , or herapdf1.5  @xcite .",
    "all of these parametrizations are available in nlo and nnlo approximations ( except for ct10 which are only available in nlo ) as well as for a series of @xmath7 values . in each case",
    ", we use those pdf sets which were obtained for @xmath21 which is closest to the current world average value  @xcite . the same value of @xmath7 is also employed in the matrix elements .",

    "the nnlo versions ( where available ) are used for the comparisons with data from hadron - hadron collisions , together with nlo matrix elements plus @xmath16 contributions from threshold corrections .",
    "correspondingly , in these comparisons @xmath13 is evolved using the numerical solutions of the 2-loop and 3-loop approximations of the renormalization group equation for dis and hadron - hadron collisions , respectively .",
    "all pqcd contributions are computed within the framework of fastnlo  @xcite using nlojet++@xcite for the lo and nlo contributions and code from the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite for the threshold corrections .",
    "the anti-@xmath22 jet algorithm is taken from the implementation in fastjet  @xcite .    the factor @xmath11 includes non - perturbative corrections due to hadronization and the underlying event .",
    "these corrections are usually obtained using monte carlo event generators and the values are published together with the measurement results .",
    "whenever this was not the case , we have computed the correction factors ourselves using pythia  6.4  @xcite with tune  a  @xcite . for dis data at high @xmath23 ,",
    "underlying event corrections are assumed to be negligible . in those cases ,",
    "the pqcd results are only corrected for hadronization effects .",
    "for some of the data sets , additional theoretical effects have already been folded into the published results .",
    "this is taken into account as follows :    * for some @xmath24 data sets ( as mentioned in section 3 ) , corrections for the underlying event have already been applied to the data . in the corresponding calculations ,",
    "pqcd theory is only corrected for hadronization effects .",
    "* observables in dis are usually corrected for higher order qed effects which may either include corrections for the running of the qed coupling @xmath25 , or not .",
    "the former is the standard choice by the zeus collaboration , and therefore the corresponding pqcd calculations are made for a fixed value of @xmath26 .",
