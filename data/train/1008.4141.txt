    "situated on the mass continuum between planets and hydrogen - burning stars are objects commonly known as brown dwarfs , with masses spanning approximately 13  up to 80  ( assuming solar metallicity ) . since the first discoveries of these substellar objects fifteen years ago @xcite , various surveys have found additional examples in numbers exceeding the population of known exoplanets . however , despite the large sample of brown dwarfs , very little is known about the physical properties or formation mechanism(s ) of these substellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most known brown dwarfs have been discovered as solitary objects by wide - field , near - infrared ( nir ) imaging surveys(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their identification is often based on spectral typing , with physical parameters derived from comparing photometric measurements to substellar evolutionary models .",
    "knowledge beyond spectral typing is limited by the difficulty in modeling the complex molecular features that dominate the spectra of cool dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a problem that persists above the hydrogen - burning mass limit for m - type dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the preferred method of measuring physical properties of substellar objects such as masses , compositions and ages , is to study examples that are physically associated with brighter main - sequence stars . by assuming both the brown dwarf and its host star formed at the same time from the same molecular cloud , ages and chemical composition of the companion can be tied to the properties of the brighter , more easily characterized component @xcite .",
    "however , brown dwarfs in these favorable `` benchmark '' configurations are found in numbers far below the sample of exoplanets , despite their relative ease of detection compared to planet - mass companions .",
    "this observed feature of the substellar mass distribution of bound companions is known as the `` brown dwarf desert , '' and the barren region extends over a wide swath around stars , extending from @xmath5  au out to hundreds of au @xcite .",
    "the existence of a deep minimum in the mass continuum between stars and planets suggests that distinct formation mechanisms operate at either mass extreme , one for stellar objects and one for planets .",
    "however , the scarcity of objects in the brown dwarf desert makes it difficult to determine where this line should be drawn .",
    "for example , it is unclear whether a 20  object in orbit around a main - sequence star formed like a massive planet , or instead should be considered part of the extreme low - mass tail of the stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an issue as fundamental as the mass - radius relationship below the hydrogen - burning limit is largely unconstrained by observations .",
    "understanding the nature and origins of brown dwarfs requires a much larger sample of detections .",
    "one promising avenue for increasing the sample of well - characterized substellar companions is through wide - field photometric transit surveys . since the radii of objects are roughly constant from 1100  @xcite , transit surveys are uniformly sensitive to companions throughout the entire brown dwarf desert .",
    "the transit light curve , together with precise radial velocities ( rv ) , provide both the absolute mass ( as opposed to minimum mass , @xmath6 ) and radius of the companion , thereby directly testing the predictions of interior structure models @xcite . once transits have been discovered , the door is opened up a wealth of follow - up opportunities that can measure properties such as the brown dwarf s albedo , temperature distribution , emission spectrum and atmospheric composition ( see , e.g. the review by * ? ? ?",
    "further , studying the distribution of physical characteristics of companions , and their relationships to the characteristics of their host stars , can inform theories of the origins of brown dwarfs in the same way that the statistical properties of exoplanets inform theories of planet formation @xcite .    in this contribution we present the discovery and characterization of a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a nearby low - mass star in the  field .",

    "the light curve depths are constant to 0.3  mmag and exhibit no obvious additional dimming at intermediate periods , consistent with the signal of a transiting planet - sized object .",
    "the astrometry shows no shift in the center of light greater than 1 millipixel ( 4  mas , @xcite ) , and there are no secondary eclipses evident at intermediate phases .",
