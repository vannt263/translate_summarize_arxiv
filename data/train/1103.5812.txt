    "the spectropolarimeter ( sp ) of the solar optical telescope ( sot , * ? ? ? * ) on board _ hinode _ @xcite reveals ubiquitous granular - sized horizontal magnetic fields in the internetwork regions @xcite .",
    "such horizontal fields are highly transient with lifetimes ranging from 1 to 10 minutes , and are called  transient horizontal magnetic fields  ( thmfs , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that a thmf has the form of an isolated flux tube in an almost field - free photosphere using sirgaus inversion code @xcite .",
    "these horizontal magnetic fields are observed in the quiet sun , a weak plage region @xcite , and the polar regions @xcite .",
    "the occurrence rate and magnetic field strength distribution ( histogram ) are exactly the same in these different regions in spite of a considerable difference in the amount of vertical magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "the mean field strength of thmfs is about 400  g @xcite , which is comparable to the equipartition field strength corresponding to the granular motion .",
    "these results suggest that a local dynamo process due to the granular motion generates thmfs all over the sun .",
    "@xcite observed that ubiquitous tangled magnetic fields with a mean field strength of @xmath3  g exist on the spatial scale of the granulation ( order of arcsec ) by means of the hanle effect .",
    "they pointed out that magnetic fields detected with the zeeman effect might be only the tip of the iceberg of the sun s magnetism so that most of the magnetism is hidden from traditional observing methods .",
    "a fundamental question is whether most of the volume of the granular region is occupied by tangled magnetic fields or has sporadic distinct form of flux tubes .    in this letter ,",
    "we study temporal and spatial distributions of thmfs with deep exposure and with large field of view ( fov ) . such long - exposure polarization maps with very wide fov allow us to obtain global distributions of much weaker horizontal magnetic fields in spatial and time domains .",
    "the spatial and temporal distributions would directly address the issues of the hidden magnetism @xcite and the origin of thmfs .",
    "a quiet solar region at disk center was observed with a cadence of 60  s using the narrowband filter imager ( nfi ) of sot on 2009 april 25 .",
    "the fov is @xmath0 , and the pixel size is @xmath4 ( @xmath52 summed mode ) .",
    "we continuously take the stokes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 images ( in total 123 sets ) in the blue wing of the  525.0  nm line with the exposure time of 4.8  sec ( same as standard sp ) .",
    "the spectral bandwidth of nfi is @xmath3  m@xmath10 .",
    "the dark current and the flat field corrections were performed .",
    "residual crosstalk between the stokes parameters was removed @xcite .",
    "the observation was performed in the shutterless mode , whose modulation scheme is exactly the same as that of sp .",
    "the nfi noise level in the stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 signals is measured by the standard deviation of each stokes signals in pixels without any apparent polarization signal , and is @xmath11 . since these pixels used for",
    "this measurement may contain weak polarization signals , the real noise level may be smaller than the number obtained here .",
    "we sum magnetograms over the whole time sequence .",
    "the exposures have constant cadences in 2 hours of observing time , and the total exposure time in the summed magnetograms is 9.8  min .",
    "this exposure time should be compared with 4.8  sec of the standard sp exposure time , and the nominal exposure time is a factor of 123 better in the summed nfi magnetogram .",
    "the noise level of the standard sp data is @xmath12 for a single wavelength pixel @xcite . for comparison , assuming that wavelength - integration for making polarization map is performed in the range of @xmath3  m@xmath10 in the blue wing of  630.25  nm line for sp , the noise level in the wavelength - integrated stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the signal to noise ratio of the summed nfi magnetogram is a factor of 4.6 ( @xmath14 ) better than that of the standard sp observation .",
    "furthermore , the effective lande g - factor is 3.0 for the  525.0  nm line , and 2.5 for the  630.25  nm line .",
    "the polarization sensitivity of the summed nfi magnetogram would be more than 4.6 ( 21.2 in exposure time ) times the standard sp .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( a ) shows the map of the circular polarization ( @xmath15 ) summed over the whole observing duration . the fov has a size that approximately covers one supargranular cell , which is delineated by the scattered vertical network fields .",
    "we sum 123 maps of linear polarization , @xmath16 ( figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the deep @xmath1 map should potentially show spatial distribution of much weaker horizontal magnetic fields , which have not been detected in the single @xmath1 map .",
    "the summed @xmath1 map clearly shows cellular structures on a scale of @xmath2 with voids .    to evaluate the statistical significance of these apparent structures",
    ", we here estimate the noise level of the summed @xmath1 map .",
    "we derive the standard deviation , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) of the photon noise of a single @xmath1 map from the pixels without any enhanced linear polarization signals . the standard deviation ,",
    "@xmath19 of the summed @xmath1 map is then simply given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of the @xmath1 images ( n=123 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( b ) , the regions with summed @xmath1 above @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 levels are shown .",
    "30% of the fov possess @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ]  ( b ) clearly shows that the cellular structure of the horizontal fields with voids is statistically significant .",
    "does the cellular distribution in figure[fig1 ]  ( b ) consist of isolated sporadic thmfs or weaker magnetic fields , which persist longer ? to answer this question , we pick up thmfs from the individual @xmath1 maps .",
    "the appearance of a thmf is defined by a timing when the area with @xmath26 becomes larger than 4  pixels .",
    "we track the thus - identified thmf as long as @xmath26 . except for the areal threshold of 4  pixels used to identify the start of an event",
    ", there is no area threshold during the subsequent tracking .",
    "37% of the fov in the summed map are pixels where thmfs occurred over the course of the observations .",
    "we also investigate how many thmfs appear in the same pixel during the 2  hours . in 67  % of the pixels that possess at least one thmf ,",
    "thmfs appear once , and in 24  % thmfs appear twice . in this case , two thmfs separated in time appear during the observing time of 2 hours .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] ( b ) represents a number of the occurrence in the small area indicated with the box in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the black area corresponds to the region where no thmfs appear during 2  hours . in the occurrence map ( figure  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) ) , the cellular structure on a scale of @xmath27 is identified and the structure is similar to that of the summed @xmath1 map in figure  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) .    figure  [ fig3 ]  ( a ) shows histograms of the 2-hour summed @xmath1 map . each line represents the @xmath1 distribution for pixels with different numbers of thmf appearances .",
    "here we focus on the summed @xmath1 histogram for pixels without any thmf appearance shown with dashed line . in spite of no appearance of thmfs , 16% of such pixels possesses summed @xmath1 greater than 1@xmath19 ( 4% greater than @xmath23 ) .",
    "do they represent the hidden magnetic fields @xcite ?",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ]  ( c ) , the pixels with the summed @xmath25 _ and _ without any thmf appearance for 2  hours are shown with black , while the pixels with the summed @xmath25 _ and _ with one or more thmf appearance are shown with white .",
    "we notice that the black dot - like regions clearly delineate the boundaries of the white regions , where thmfs appear at least once .",
    "this indicates that these black pixels are also occupied by thmfs , but their @xmath1 does not reach the @xmath28 threshold . in the summed @xmath1 map , we do not find any signature of weak extended horizontal magnetic fields . instead ,",
    "the structure seen in the deep exposure map consists of individual isolated thmfs .",
    "the peak of the histogram in figure  [ fig3 ]  ( a ) is shifted toward higher @xmath1 with an increasing number of thmf appearances .",
    "this indicates that the regions with multiple appearances of thmfs have higher @xmath1 .",
    "examples of such multiple appearances are found at positions [ @xmath29 , @xmath30 and [ @xmath31 , @xmath32 in figure  [ fig2 ] ( b ) . on the other hand , the number of occurrences is not necessarily high in the pixels even with high summed @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the @xmath1 histograms overlap with @xmath33 regardless of the different number of thmf occurrences ( figure  [ fig3 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "for instance , at [ @xmath34 , @xmath29 ] in figure  [ fig2 ] ( b ) , even though 2-hour summed @xmath1 is high , the number of occurrences is 1 . in such regions ,",
    "thmfs with long lifetimes or with higher linear polarization signals would appear .",
    "we confirm that regions with statistically significant summed @xmath1 essentially have an isolated thmfs at least once for two hours of observation time .      in the previous two sections ,",
    "we show that the regions where thmfs appear have structures on a scale of @xmath36 , which is larger than a typical granule size . in this section",
    "we compare the summed @xmath1 map with the photospheric flow pattern with a spatial scale larger than that of granules .",
    "we apply a subsonic filter to the time series of stokes @xmath6 images with a cut off velocity at 10  km  s@xmath37 @xcite . from these filtered images ,",
    "we obtain the horizontal flow velocity using the local correlation technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique compares the small subfields in each image with those in the subsequent image , and obtains the displacement that provides the best correlation .",
    "the small subfields are defined by the apodization window with a gaussian function .",
    "the choice of the fwhm of the apodization window should depend on the spatial scale of what we want to track . for the present work we use an fwhm of @xmath38 @xcite , and derived velocity maps are averaged over the whole time sequence to measure the horizontal flow with scale size larger than the granular flow in temporal and spatial domain .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ]  ( c ) represents the horizontal flow field plotted over the divergence map ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the positive divergence is distributed with a scale of @xmath2 , and corresponds to mesogranules ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "comparing figure  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) with ( c ) , it appears that the @xmath1 avoids the region with the positive divergence ( see movie ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ]  ( b ) represents the relationship between the @xmath1 signals summed over 2  hours and the divergence of the horizontal flow field .",
    "we find a weak dependence of @xmath1 on the divergence : pixels with weak @xmath1 signals appear to have positive divergence , while pixels with strong @xmath1 signals appear to have negative divergence .",
    "the @xmath1 signals are essentially concentrated on the negative divergence area , which corresponds to the boundary of mesogranules .",
    "on the other hand , we do not find any relationship of the summed @xmath1 with the rotation of the horizontal flow field .      in figure  [ fig2 ] ( e )",
    "we plot the azimuth directions of thmfs when the area of each thmf become the largest through their time evolution .",
    "when multiple thmfs appear at different times at the same position , the lines showing the azimuth direction of each thmf overlap .",
    "we find no coherent magnetic field lines extending to a mesogranular scale .",
    "furthermore , even though thmfs appear at several times , the azimuth directions seem to be random .",
    "these results would suggest that there are no coherent magnetic fields on a mesogoranular scale lying below the solar surface , or even if such magnetic fields exist , the field strength is too weak to maintain its memory to the surface .      in this section",
    "we examine whether there is any typical timescale for the thmf appearance . as we described in section [ occurrence ] , 37% of the pixels throughout the fov possess thmfs , and thmfs appear twice in 24% of the pixels , which have thmfs at least once . figure  [ fig3 ]  ( c )",
    ", solid line represents time intervals between the first and the second thmf appearances at each pixel in which thmf appears twice for 2  hours .",
    "we find a strong peak at 2 - 4 minutes .",
    "thmfs have lifetimes ranging from 1  min to 10  min @xcite , and this peak would originate from the false identification of thmfs with @xmath1 close to the detection threshold .",
    "we normalize the histogram by the total number of pixels with time intervals of two thmfs longer than 10  minutes . over 10  minutes",
    ", the distributions do not show any peak . for comparison , as summarized by @xcite , the lifetime of the mesogranules ranges from 30  min to 6  hours depending on analyses , while the turnover time of granules is believed to be of the order of 1000  sec .",
    "though our observing time is limited to 2 hours , we do not see any signature associated with these time scales of the flow field .",
    "dashed lines show the distribution of time intervals when thmfs appear randomly twice for 2  hours . to put 2 balls ( thmfs ) into",
    "123 linearly numbered boxes ( time bins ) @xmath40=7503 combinations are possible in total , and we measure the intervals of two balls for all cases .",
    "this corresponds to the case of random distribution ( dashed line in figure  [ fig3 ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "there is a remarkable coincidence between the measured interval of thmfs and the interval of the random distribution .",
    "this shows that the multiple appearances of thmf are independent , i.e. random , and are not causally related .",
    "appearances of thmfs are organized by mesogranular velocity field in spatial domain , but are random in time domain .",
    "we have analyzed the vector magnetograms taken at  525.0  nm with long exposure time to investigate spatial and temporal distributions of thmfs .",
    "we find that the deep - exposure @xmath1 map has a clear cellular structure with spatial scale of @xmath2 .",
    "although we anticipate with its better signal to noise ratio that such an @xmath1 map allows us to detect weak polarization signals possibly extended in temporal and spatial domains , we do not find any such structure .",
    "instead , we demonstrate in this letter that such a summed @xmath1 map essentially represents the occurrence distribution of thmfs , which we see in much shorter exposure @xmath1 maps .",
    "we infer that , in the quiet sun , isolated horizontal flux tubes exist in the essentially field - free regions .",
    "such isolated flux tubes are sporadically ( intermittently ) observed as thmfs in the photosphere .",
    "we compare the deep - exposure @xmath1 map with the photospheric horizontal flow field , and find a correlation between the flow field and the distribution of @xmath1 : the regions abundant in @xmath1 coincide in position with negative divergence areas .",
    "since @xmath41=0 , this negative divergence area is the region with downflow , corresponding to the boundary of the mesogranules .",
    "interestingly , thmfs do not appear in the intergranular lanes where downflow dominates @xcite .",
    "the location of thmfs is restricted to the downflow region of mesogranules , although the appearance of thmfs would be driven by the granular upward motion .",
    "the azimuth directions of thmfs appear to be random on a mesogranular scale .",
    "when thmfs appear more than once , their azimuth directions and the time interval are random .",
    "the random appearance of thmfs in time may not be consistent with a scenario of observed horizontal magnetic fields simply being maintained by recycling ( without any dynamo process ) of magnetic fields in the granular convective motions : the emerged horizontal magnetic fields do not come back to the convection zone , and are not subject to recycling and subsequent emergence .",
    "instead , they reach above the photosphere as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mesogranular pattern was also found for vertical magnetic elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported from a single sot / sp snap shot that linear polarization signal as well as circular one are organized on a scale of @xmath2 .",
    "are both the vertical magnetic fields and thmfs transported to the mesogranular boundaries with the same mechanism ? such a concentrated circular polarization signal may be at least partially contributed by the footpoints of thmfs found in the mesogranular boundaries .",
    "@xcite simulated the motion of corks advected by the observed flow velocity field , and found that the observed vertical magnetic elements have a distribution similar to that of the corks ( mesogranular concentration ) .",
    "one difference between the two cases ( vertical vs. horizontal ) is that the vertical magnetic fields tend to be pinned down and can stay in the granular and mesogranular downflow region , while the horizontal fields may be subject to the continuous turnover motion .",
    "indeed , no thmfs appear in the intergranular lanes , while we find elemental vertical flux tubes in the intergranular lanes .",
    "if thmfs are transported by the mesogranular flow and somehow stay in the mesogranular downflows , these thmfs should have had more uniform azimuthal distribution .",
    "in fact , there is no correlation in the azimuthal angles of thmfs .",
    "the mean field strength of thmfs is comparable to the equipartition field strength ( @xmath42 ) corresponding to the granular motion , and is much stronger than @xmath42 corresponding to mesogranular flow velocity of 300 - 500  m  s@xmath37 ( see table 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "this may make the transport of the thmfs with mesogranular flow difficult .",
    "these considerations indicate that thmfs are not advected like the vertical magnetic fields .",
    "then , why do we see such clear concentrations of thmfs around the boundaries of mesogranules ?",
    "any dynamo mechanism needs seed magnetic fields . such seed fields with field strength less than the mesogranular @xmath42 may be easily advected to the boundaries of mesogranulation , and a local dynamo mechanism amplifies the field strength from mesogranular @xmath42 to granular @xmath42 .",
    "the local dynamo process can occur anywhere due to the ubiquitous granular motion .",
    "but , the seed fields are provided to the mesogranular boundaries by the mesogranular flow field .    as a last note",
    ", we have not discussed something important , namely the relationship between thmfs and supergranulation .",
    "the lack of the observations is due to the limitation of the fov in this particular observation ( figure  [ fig1 ] ( a ) ) . in order to obtain the supergranular flow pattern by smoothing out the granulation and the mesogranulation , a longer observation and a larger",
    "fov is necessary @xcite .",
    "this is left to future hinode and/or groundbased observations .",
    "our observation belongs to the hinode operation plan ( hop ) 71 , supported by k. ichimoto , r. a. shine , and t. j. okamoto .",
    "the authors thank v. martnez pillet for stimulating discussion .",
    "_ hinode _ is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as a domestic partner and nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "it is operated by these agencies in co - operation with esa and nsc ( norway ) ."
