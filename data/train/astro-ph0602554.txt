    "stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) is a system of four strongly interacting galaxies in a compact group , and a likely foreground galaxy seen in projection against them @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable aspects of sq is a @xmath040 kpc long non - thermal radio continuum structure ( see fig.1 ) lying in intergalactic space between the galaxies @xcite . the same structure is also seen in x - rays , and has been shown to be consistent with a large - scale shock wave , based on the optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "it is probable @xcite that the shock wave has formed because a high - velocity `` intruder '' galaxy , , is colliding with the inter - group - medium ( igm ) located within the main group .",
    "we assume here a group distance of 94 mpc , assuming a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath3 and a systemic velocity for the group as a whole of 6600 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we used the infrared spectrograph @xcite on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ to take mid - ir spectra at the peak in the ir / radio emission from the shocked region .",
    "observations were made on november 17 and        fig.1 stephan s quintet showing the positioning of the irs slits centered on @xmath4(j2000 ) = 22h 35 m 59.57s , @xmath5(j2000 ) = + 33d 58 m 1.8s .",
    "contours are vla 1.4 ghz radio emission superimposed on an r - band optical image@xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission ( not shown here ) follows closely that of the radio .",
    "only the central portion of the slits ( red boxes ) were common to the two separate observing ( nod ) positions made in each irs module slit ( the purple shows the full coverage ) .",
    "short - low = sl = 57 x 3.6 arcsecs@xmath6 , short - high = sh = 11.3 x 4.7 arcsec@xmath6 , and long - high = lh = 22.3 x 11.1 arcsecs@xmath6 .",

    "the raw data were processed through the ssc irs s11-science pipeline to create 2-d flat - fielded images of the spectral orders .",
    "these data were further processed to remove the effects of the so - called rogue pixels which were not corrected by the pipeline .",
    "these pixels have erratic high dark - currents which vary with time , and were replaced using a simple pixel interpolation scheme . flux and wavelength calibration was performed using the standard calibration methods @xcite .",

    "slit oriented along the shock structure , we found that the h@xmath2 emission was extended on the scale of 52 arcsecs ( 24 kpc ) , declining slowly from a small peak at the pointing centre .",
    "we therefore consider three possible distributions : a ) the h@xmath2 originates in a point source  an unrealistic limiting case , b ) the h@xmath2 is extended with constant surface brightness over the slits , and c ) a `` preferred '' case based on the observed sl distribution , assuming it has a similar spatial width to the radio emission . table 1 provides a list of the lines and their measured fluxes , including upper limits for some key undetected lines .",
    "figure 3 shows the excitation diagram for h@xmath2 , ( n / g ) versus the upper - level energy , for the 5 detected and one undetected hydrogen transitions .",
    "n is the molecular column density , g is the statistical weight for that transition . the non - linear decline of log ( n / g ) with upper - level energy is commonly seen in shocks within the galaxy , as well as in external galaxies @xcite , and is an indication that no single temperature lte model fits these data .",
    "there are no obvious deviations from the assumed ortho / para ratio = 3 visible in these plots .",
    "we fit a multi - temperature model through the `` preferred '' data points , constraining the warm gas by the s(0)/s(2 ) [ para ] ratio , and allowing the higher order s(3)/s(5 ) [ ortho ] transitions to provide a very rough guide to the temperature of a hotter component .",
    "our data are consistent with a warm t  =  185@xmath930k component ( h@xmath2 column density 2.06 @xmath10 10@xmath11 cm@xmath3 ) and t  =  675@xmath980k ( column 1.54 @xmath10 10@xmath13 cm@xmath3 ) for the hotter components .",
    "the choice of a 2-component temperature model ( especially the hotter component ) is quite arbitrary : in reality ( if our interpretation is correct that the emission arises in a highly turbulent medium ) it is likely to be the sum of a continuous distribution of multi - temperature components . however , the coolest component dominates the hydrogen column density estimates given here .",
    "we note that a multi - phase medium could also lead to a similar excitation pattern .",

    "the colored lines represent three different assumed spatial distributions of the h@xmath2 across the lh and sh slits . for sl ,",
    "we scale the spectrum to that of sh using the 0 - 0 s(2 ) line which is detected in common .",
    "the blue line ( and error bars ) represents the `` preferred '' distribution based on an extrapolation from the h@xmath2 distribution seen in the sl slit ( see text ) , the green line and red show the limiting cases of an infinite and point source distribution respectively .",
    "the dotted lines represent a rough model for the `` preferred '' distribution which assumes a two - temperature fit to the points .",
    "the solid line represents the sum of these components .",
    "the total h@xmath2 line luminosity , accounting for an extra 40% in undetected lines , is 8.4 @xmath10 10@xmath14 ergs s@xmath1 from the sh slit area alone .",
    "the corresponding h@xmath2 mass in these warm / hot components seen in the sh slit is 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath15 m@xmath16 ( @xmath17@xmath18 = 3.1 m@xmath16 pc@xmath3 ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 surface luminosity of 2.0 l@xmath16 pc@xmath3 , is only a factor of three less than the ir continuum surface luminosity of 5.4 l@xmath16 pc@xmath3 (= 2.5 @xmath10 10@xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 ) based on an extrapolation from unpublished 70@xmath8 m spitzer data by one of us ( rjt  and consistent with earlier iso data from xu et al .",
    "the corresponding h@xmath2 lines and fir continuum surface brightnesses are 10@xmath10 and 26@xmath10 the x - ray ( 0.51.5  kev ) surface brightness ( 0.21 l@xmath16 pc@xmath3 ) respectively .",
    "the dominance of the fir continuum emission over the x - ray emission confirms that the shocked gas is cooling primarily through inelastic collisions of the ions and electrons with grains , as proposed by ( xu et al .",
    "2003who derived a cooling timescale of @xmath02  myrs ) , and may explain the unexpectedly cool post - shock x - ray gas seen in recent xmm observations @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that a substantial minority of the total cooling also proceeds through h@xmath2 lines comes as a surprise .",
    "a remarkable feature of the spitzer observations ( fig.4 ) is the discovery that the h@xmath2 line is extremely broad and resolved spectrally , even with the relative low resolution of the irs ( r=600 ) . assuming a gaussian decomposition from the instrument profile",
    ", we estimate the intrinsic width of the 0 - 0  s(1 ) line to be 870 @xmath960 km s@xmath1 : exceeding the largest known h@xmath2 line - width known to date ( e. g. the ulirg ngc 6240 ; @xmath20v @xmath0 680 km s@xmath1 ) @xcite . because h@xmath2 is a fragile molecule which can easily be destroyed in 50 km s@xmath1 j - shocks @xcite ,",
    "such a wide , potentially intrinsic , spread in molecular cloud velocities is extremely unusual .",
    "the line - width is comparable with the collision - velocity ( @xmath20v @xmath0500 - 600 km s@xmath1 ) of ngc 7318b with either ngc 7319 or an inter - galactic gas filament ( allen & hartsuiker 1972 ; van der hulst 1981 ; williams et al .",
    "2002 ; sulentic et al .",
    "2001 ; trinchieri et al .",
    "2003 ; trinchieri et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting that the h@xmath2 emission is intimately linked to the formation of the radio and x - ray shock structure .",
    "fig.4 the 0 - 0 s(1)17.0@xmath8 m molecular hydrogen line ( detected with a signal to noise ratio of 33 ) is clearly resolved ( intrinsic fwhm = 870@xmath960 km s@xmath1 ) by the irs ( black ) as compared with two unresolved spectral lines ( r = 600 ) in the planetary nebula ngc 6543 at 15.6 and 18.7@xmath8 m which bracket the h@xmath2 line ( grey ) .",
    "similar broad widths are found for the 0 - 0  s(0 ) and 0 - 0  s(2 ) lines .",
    "the width of the [ neii]@xmath712.8@xmath8 m line is significantly less broad ( intrinsic fwhm = 600@xmath980 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "@xmath7@xmath21 is the wavelength of the line center for the three lines shown in order to allow their widths to be compared .",
    "although the irs does not have the spectral resolution to determine whether the apparently broad line is made up of a number of narrow line components blended together along the line of sight , or whether the line is truly broad , there are some pieces of evidence that favor the latter .",
    "these are , 1 ) broad ( @xmath20v = 1000 km s@xmath1 ) optical [ oi]@xmath76300 line emission with excitation properties of shocked gas is seen at our observing position @xcite , whereas at other positions much further from the peak of the x - ray / ir ridge narrower lines are seen , ( 2 ) extremely high speed shocks are highly dissociative , and it is unlikely that pre - existing h@xmath2 , nor even more fragile pah molecules , could survive a @xmath22500 km s@xmath1 collision with the intruder @xcite . furthermore , the h@xmath2 line luminosity we see from the region ( @xmath02 l@xmath16 pc@xmath3 ) is a significant fraction of the predicted @xcite mechanical luminosity density in the shock ( 160 @xmath10 the h@xmath4 surface density , @xmath23 = 160 x 0.13 l@xmath16 pc@xmath3 = 21 l@xmath16 pc@xmath3 )",
    ". there would appear to be plenty of mechanical luminosity available to excite the h@xmath2 molecules if they reformed in post - shocked gas .",
    "if we assume a 500 km s@xmath1 shock is driven into the igm , and second similar shock into the intruder ( assuming their densities are similar ) , this will create an unstable turbulent ( @xmath20v @xmath0 1000 km s@xmath1 ) cooling layer where the flows mix .",
    "if the gas can cool quickly enough , h@xmath2 recombination would occur in that layer , and this would have the necessary properties to explain our observations  including the high velocity dispersion from turbulence .",
    "the cooling timescale  @xcite for the hot x - ray gas in each shock wave , @xmath24@xmath25 ( myrs ) = 0.24 @xmath26 , where v@xmath27 is the speed of the shock in units of 500 km s@xmath1 , z is the metallicity in solar units and @xmath28 is the pre - shock density ( we assume @xmath28 = 0.027 @xmath29 , from x - ray observations @xcite ) . for @xmath30 @xmath0 1 , @xmath31 = 1 , @xmath24@xmath25 = 9.5 myrs , during which time the shock wave",
    "would have travelled @xmath0 5kpc = 10 arcsecs ( or twice this for the double shock ) . in reality",
    ", the cooling layer would be much sharper , since this analysis excludes the effects of ir - cooling by dust which is known to be very significant @xcite .",
    "this argument demonstrates that the post - shocked gas layer would cool fast enough to begin forming h@xmath2 within the viewing zone of the irs slits even for a mainly transverse geometry for the shock propagation as projected on the sky , the observed h@xmath2 column of the cooler component ( @xmath02 @xmath10 10@xmath11 @xmath29 ) could easily be built up over a scale of a few kpc from the available pre - shocked gas mass once the temperature of the gas had cooled sufficiently for h@xmath2 to form .",
    "one challenge for the post - shock origin of the h@xmath2 is to avoid putting too much of the shock dissipation energy into the x - ray component .",
    "usually in high - speed shocks , x - ray dissipation dominates the cooling in the t= 10@xmath32 to 10@xmath33 k regime , before h@xmath2 molecules can form : not the case here since h@xmath2 line emission exceeds the x - rays by a factor of ten .",
    "part of the answer may come from the even stronger ir continuum seen at longer wavelengths ( xu et al 2003 ) .",
    "these authors argued that the principal coolant in the shock is from large grains which efficiently cool the shock through far - ir emission .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission from the post - shocked material could be additionally boosted relative to the x - rays by invoking a glancing collision between the intruder galaxy and the igm  which would create an oblique - shock geometry rather than a plane - parallel one . in oblique shocks , much more energy is carried in bulk transverse motions ( hence reducing x - ray dissipation ) , and the shock is significantly weakened ( e. g. dopita 2003 ) , while still allowing a fraction of the mechanical energy to cascade down to smaller and smaller scales ( as in the galactic ism e. g. mckee , chernoff & hollenbach 1984 ; elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) , where shock - speeds would be lower and molecules could re - form in the post - shocked medium . to test these ideas",
    "will require detailed 3-d hydrodynamic models beyond the scope of this observational paper .",
    "an alternative explanation for the h@xmath2 emission is to postulate that the emission comes from a 500 km / s shock overrunning a clumpy pre - shocked medium .",
    "this has the advantage that dense clouds ( embedded in a more diffuse medium ) will experience much slower shocks and are more likely to cool through line emission than x - rays , whereas the fir emission could come from grains emitting over the entire diffuse medium  thus partly explaining the anomalous h@xmath2 line to ir continuum ratio .",
    "the large velocity dispersion could arise because the shock would eventually accelerate clouds to different velocities within the shock , or because of multiple velocity components being present in the pre - shocked gas .",
    "the problem with this picture is that we might expect to see pah emission from the precursor ism which is not observed .",
    "we note that if the h@xmath4 emission seen from the shocked regions was scaled to an equivalent pah line strength typical of those seen in the largest of the m51 hii regions ( calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) , we should have easily ( @xmath2210-sigma ) detected the signal even in the case of no extinction correction for the h@xmath4 .",
    "of course the ism of any precursor material is likely to contribute only a small factor to the h@xmath4 emission observed , but this provides an upper limit .",
    "the shock is also likely to be radiative , which could also help to destroy pah molecules , whereas the more refactory grains must have been able to survive the shock .",
    "this model still has to be capable of predicting the large ratio of h@xmath2 line luminosity relative to the ir continuum luminosity  implying a lot of energy has to be somehow channeled into mechanical energy .",
    "further modeling of these scenario will be required in order to determine whether it can explain all the available data on the shock .",
    "future h@xmath2 observations with much higher velocity and spatial resolution may allow us to explore further the nature of the emission mechanism that is generating such large h@xmath2 line flux",
    ". there are hints of large - scale clumpyness in the h@xmath2 distribution as seen by sl along the shock front , and studying the velocity and spatial inhomogenities within the shock would be highly beneficial .",
    "the discovery of strong , high velocity - dispersion h@xmath2 emission in a large - scale group - wide shock wave provides support for the idea @xcite , that shock waves are primarily responsible for the strong h@xmath2 emission lines seen in many ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "indeed our observations suggest l(h@xmath2 ) @xmath22 10@xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 over the whole shock structure  comparable to the h@xmath2 luminosity of arp 220 , but a factor of ten less than ngc 6240 @xcite .",
    "an alternative idea for ngc 6240 is that x - rays heating the gas , rather than shocks , is the dominant mechanism for the ir lines in ulirgs @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to the low x - ray surface density compared with the h@xmath2 lines , our spectra of sq , show little evidence of the h@xmath34@xmath35@xmath716.33@xmath8 m line : a key diagnostic of this model . although the geometry of the shocks are unlikely to be identical to that suggested by the sq observations , there is little doubt that large - scale shocks must be present in ulirgs , where high velocity streams of molecular gas must collide  especially in the early stages of a merger .",
