    "accretion disks around neutron stars are often subject to sudden intense radiation fields due to type i x - ray bursts @xcite , or , on rare occasions , superbursts @xcite .",
    "these events can reach the eddington luminosity , and thus deposit a large amount of energy in the accretion disk over a short amount of time ( tens of seconds for type i bursts ; hours for superbursts ) .",
    "the accretion disk structure may be altered by this sudden injection of energy , as suggested by the evolution of x - ray reflection features observed from the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) 4u  182030  during a superburst @xcite . in this source ,",
    "modeling of fe  k@xmath3  line and edge features produced by the disk indicated that the reflecting part of the disk moved outward from @xmath4  @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the neutron star ) to @xmath8  @xmath5 in @xmath9  s , before eventually returning to @xmath10  @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior was puzzling because the change in the reflecting radius was not correlated with the observed x - ray flux , but with the hardness of the blackbody spectrum .",
    "@xcite therefore proposed a model in which the surface density of the inner accretion disk was altered by heating from the incident x - rays ; however , alternative models have not yet been carefully considered .    in this paper , we examine in detail a number of different physical processes which may alter the structure of accretion disks during a sudden heating event .",
    "the physics are treated as generally as possible , but quantitative comparisons are made with the 4u  182030results in order to test the individual models as possible explanations for the inferred behavior .",
    "we begin in the next section by reviewing the observed properties of 4u  182030 .",
    "the paper is then broken into three sections based on the different possibilities for the accretion disk response . in ",
    "[ sect : outflows ] we consider outflow mechanisms , such as thermally and radiatively driven winds .",

    "the results are gathered and discussed in   [ sect : discuss ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in   [ sect : concl ] .",
    "4u  182030  is one of the most compact lmxbs known with an orbital period of only 11.4 minutes @xcite .",
    "evolutionary models of the system @xcite all predict that the accreting material is primarily helium .",
    "type i x - ray bursts from 4u  182030  have been observed for nearly 30 years @xcite , and have recurrence times between 2 and 4 hours .",
    "@xcite presents further details and models of the type i x - ray bursts from 4u  182030 .",
    "although the system resides within the metal rich globular cluster ngc  6624 , the distance to 4u  182030  is still not precisely known .",
    "the difficulty arises because of uncertainties in the interstellar extinction along the line - of - sight , and in the metallicity relation used to correct the absolute magnitude of horizontal branch stars .",
    "thus , using the same technique , @xcite derived the distance to 4u  182030  of 7.6@xmath110.4  kpc , in agreement with an earlier estimate @xcite , while @xcite found it to be 6.4@xmath12  kpc .",

    "[ fig : loverledd ] we plot the time evolution of @xmath19 over the first 1600  s of the 4u  182030superburst .",

    "separate curves are plotted for the different distance estimates described above . since large super - eddington luminosities are not expected for x - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this figure seems to indicate that the 5.8  kpc distance may be the most reasonable .",
    "however , by using equation  [ eq : ledd ] we find that increasing the mass and radius of the neutron star to , for example , 1.7  m@xmath16 and 12  km , would make the 6.4  kpc distance consistent with @xmath20 .",
    "the 7.6  kpc distance is more challenging , but a much larger mass and radius ( for example , @xmath7=2.3  m@xmath16 and @xmath21=18  km ) can allow the eddington luminosity to approach the observed value .",
    "such a large mass is implied by the highest frequency of the khz qpo discovered from 4u  182030  if it is assumed to correspond to the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that since the superburst had a pre phase to it , the emitting photosphere may be larger than the true stellar radius , resulting in @xmath20 being underestimated , and therefore overestimating @xmath19 . because of these uncertainties , we will , if necessary , use all three values of the distance in the following sections , and continue to assume @xmath17  ergs  s@xmath18 .",
    "x - ray bursts are seen from 4u  182030  when the persistent x - ray flux is @xmath22  ergs  @xmath23  s@xmath18 , which is the low end of the observed range .",
    "this emission is powered by accretion onto the neutron star , so the flux can be converted to an accretion rate , @xmath24  g  s@xmath25  m@xmath16  yr@xmath18 @xcite , consistent with the prediction of gravitational radiation driven mass - loss @xcite . using the above value of @xmath20 and the observed persistent luminosity",

    "it is unknown what occurred to the material within 20  @xmath5 to prevent it from reflecting ( this is speculated upon in   [ sect : discuss ] ) , so we will only consider the evolution of the disk between 20 and 100  @xmath5 . the accretion rate onto the neutron star is low enough ( for all three values of the distance )",

    "this is much lower than the number density predicted by @xcite , but may be reasonable for the surface layers where the density must fall off rapidly .",
    "equation  [ eq : surfdens ] can also be used to calculate the gravitational potential energy of the disk material between 20 and 100  @xmath5 , @xmath50  ergs .",
    "the energy released during the first @xmath51  s of the 4u  182030  superburst is @xmath52  ergs , assuming isotropic radiation .",
    "therefore , there seems to be enough energy in the radiation field to completely remove the reflecting region of the accretion disk in a radiatively driven wind .",
    "the viability of such a wind is considered in more detail below .",
    "a numerical wind model can be used to calculate the radiative acceleration , velocity , and escape time for outflowing gas . for this paper , we define a model of a continuum - driven wind , launched from the accretion disk , and moving along radial streamlines ( radial because the wind is driven by momentum taken from radially - streaming photons ) .",
    "this outflow structure therefore fills an open bi - cone in which gas flows radially outward , nearly along the surface of the accretion disk ( for simplicity the wind is set here to flow at a constant @xmath53 above the disk ) .",
    "the wind s acceleration is computed by taking the local velocity , density , ionization structure , and transmitted continuum into account .",
    "the outflow is launched from a user - defined radius with a nearly optically thick column at the disk ( the maximum column that a radiation driving could support ) , with the initial outflow speed set to the sound speed .",
    "the photoionization of this outflowing gas is then simulated using cloudy @xcite at various heights in the wind .",
    "these simulations yield both the transmitted continuum and the ionization state of the gas from which the radiative acceleration can be calculated . integrating this acceleration then yields the solution for the velocity as a function of distance along the wind .",
    "we then iterate on this solution to ensure that the density , photoionization , acceleration , and velocity profiles are all consistent .",
    "the initial conditions for the model are chosen to match the observed and modeled properties of 4u  1820 - 30 @xcite .",
    "first , the gas is illuminated with a 2.6  kev blackbody continuum , matching the temperature inferred by @xcite near the peak of the observed flux .",
    "we use gas abundances for cool extreme helium stars as given by @xcite .",
    "the initial number density was set to @xmath54 at the disk s surface , as implied by the simple calculation in the previous section limit beyond which cloudy s three - body recombination calculations are defined @xcite . however , for these luminosities , the ionization level is so high ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the density of ionizing photons ) that this will not substantially affect our results . ] .",
    "the innermost streamline of the wind is set to a radius of 20  @xmath5 , the initial distance derived from the fe  k@xmath3line . as mentioned above ,",
    "the base of the wind is simulated as being approximately optically thick with @xmath57 to model the entire wind that would be launched radiatively from the disk and to set a conservative limit on the velocity of the outflowing gas . at the specified initial density , this column implies wind launching radii of 20 to @xmath5870  @xmath5 , approximately the same range as the observed variation in the fe  k@xmath3  emission radius .",
    "these models are then run for a range of @xmath59 values .",
    "for these calculations , it is important to note that the @xmath60 defined in   [ sect : overview ] is replaced by the _",

    ", we can effectively disregard the final bracketed expression in eq .",

    "thus , @xmath59 is set to the local value that the disk and wind would see .    with the above parameters , models",
    "are then run for a range of eddington ratios to examine the resultant outflow velocities .",
    "these simulations show that the gas is highly ionized by the superburst , such that the wind is accelerated only by electron scattering and bound - free opacity of the wind , justifying _ a posteriori _ the approximation that the wind is continuum - driven .",
    "figure  [ vobsplot ] shows the velocity of this wind at @xmath63  @xmath5 as a function of the eddington ratio .",
    "the time required for the gas to be launched from 20 to 100  @xmath5 is therefore calculated by a numerical integral over @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the velocity as a function of distance along the outflow streamline .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ tauplot ] for the model where @xmath57 at the base of the wind .",
    "the gas would easily be driven beyond 100  @xmath5 in @xmath66@xmath67  s as long as the source has @xmath68 .",
    "these results are insensitive to changes in initial conditions , such as the initial density or blackbody temperature , since variations in either do not substantially change the ionization state of the gas or the continuum acceleration .",
    "we now ask whether the mass outflow rate from the disk is enough to remove a significant amount of mass from the accretion disk . from the above model with @xmath69  @xmath49 , for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 at @xmath73  @xmath74 . calculating @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the covering fraction of the outflow , we find @xmath77 . in ",

    "the geometry of the calculated streamlines imply @xmath79 , resulting in an outflow rate @xmath80 times smaller than the theoretical estimate .",
    "therefore , these calculations show that it is feasible for a continuum - driven outflow to remove a significant portion of the inner accretion disk during a superburst , but only for @xmath68 and it would not completely empty the inner accretion disk around 4u  182030  on the timescales observed ( @xmath39  s ) .",
    "the observed mass accretion rate for this system is @xmath81 (   [ sect : overview ] ) , implying that the replenishment rate in the disk is very competitive with the outflow rate .",
    "the gas near the surface of the accretion disk around the neutron star will be subject to intense x - ray heating by the explosion .",
    "if the temperature of the material increases to the point where the local sound speed exceeds the escape velocity then a thermal , pressure - driven wind could form , removing material from the disk .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed as a means to disperse circumstellar gas around newly forming stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it is very unlikely that such a wind will form close to a compact object such as a neutron star , where the escape velocity will be a large fraction of the speed of light .",

    "a radiative driven wind off the accretion disk is an effective means to remove mass from the inner regions of the disk .",

    "@xcite found that the x - ray reflecting region drastically changed @xmath39  s into the burst , when the luminosity would have been sub - eddington .",
    "second , the mass outflow rates predicted by the numerical wind calculations are too small to remove the inner disk ( assuming it is a shukura - sunyaev disk ) unless it subtends a significant fraction of the sky as seen from the x - ray source . furthermore , the accretion rate through the disk is of the same order or even greater than the predicted outflow rates , and thus increases the difficulty in removing the inner disk",
    ".    on the other hand , it may not be necessary to completely excavate the inner disk in order to remove the reflection features .",
    "all that is required is to replace the optically - thick , efficiently reflecting disk with something that is a poor reflector .",
    "if a wind is blown off the disk , then it may obscure the surface from the x - rays and thereby destroy the reflection features .",
    "the longer observed timescale may be related to this more inefficient evaporation of the disk .",
    "more detailed simulations are required to test this idea .",
    "in   [ sect : inflow ] we found that poynting - robertson drag is an efficient mechanism to remove angular momentum from the gas .",
    "however , the predicted infall timescale is so rapid that the superburst would drain the entire accretion disk onto the star in only a few seconds .",
    "clearly , the simple analytic estimate employed in   [ sect : inflow ] is not applicable to the case of optically thick accretion disks .",
    "one important issue with the analysis is the single particle assumption in equation  [ eq : t2 ] . if the illuminated gas on the disk is significantly coupled by the viscous stresses ( e.g. , magnetically ) to other areas in the disk , then the mass and cross - section of this larger , more massive parcel of gas would replace the single particle in eq .",
    "[ eq : t2 ] .",
    "the details of this coupling would obviously depend on the viscous physics within the accretion disk , but could produce a mechanism to reduce the angular momentum loss rate in this material . a full radiation hydrodynamics simulation which included radiative transfer would be needed to completely elucidate the effects of radiation drag on the disk material .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that radiation drag will only be important for the very innermost regions of the accretion flow ( as concentrated on by @xcite ) .",
    "the high luminosity of the burst will very quickly reduce the angular momentum from this material and increase the local accretion rate .",

    "the final mechanism considered in the paper involved neither outflow nor inflow ( although it seems likely that both are occurring at some level ) , but rather a change in disk structure or surface density due to x - ray heating .",
    "this scenario is the easiest to explain the correlations seen in the x - ray data , as it predicts a strong dependence on the blackbody temperature ( rather than the flux ) , and the viscous timescale is of the right order ( with @xmath1@xmath2 ) to account for the trends seen in the reflections fits .",
    "however , it is the hardest to justify theoretically because the x - ray heating would change the local disk structure on a dynamical time , much faster than the viscous time .",
    "we suggest therefore that the intense and long lasting heating does have a large impact on the disk transport mechanisms which will change on the appropriate timescale . if the surface density drops globally over the inner accretion disk , due to the material being puffed up by x - ray heating",
    ", then it could easily become an inefficient reflector .",
    "unfortunately , to truly determine if this mechanism is the correct explanation , and to determine its importance relative to the inflow and outflow scenarios described above , a full numerical simulation which encompasses all the relevant physics will need to be performed .",
    "this is planned for future work .",
    "of course , there is the possibility that the spectral features identified by @xcite are not due to reflection at all .",
    "@xcite argue that since the disk will be heated very quickly to the blackbody temperature by the burst , all the heavy metals will be entirely ionized and unable to produce reflection features .",
    "these authors propose that the fe  k@xmath3  line and edge are formed in an outflow from the stellar surface @xcite . while it is possible that spectral features may form in an outflow ( although it would be unusual to find a large column of heavy metals close to the surface of a neutron star ; @xcite ; @xcite ) it is not clear that the disk will be entirely ionized by the superburst .",
    "numerical simulations of accretion disks subject to the magnetorotational instability consistently find that the gas is inhomogeneous and clumpy due to turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these density inhomogeneities may enhance the line emission in the x - ray reflection spectrum @xcite .",
    "the spectral fitting by @xcite measured the ionization parameter @xmath141 of the reflecting region on the disk .",
    "shakura - sunyaev disk theory can be used to estimate @xmath142 and determine if the disk is expected to be completely overionized .",
    "writing @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we obtain @xmath145 the scale - height @xmath136 for a gas - pressure dominated disk with electron scattering opacity is @xmath146 using this expression , equation  [ eq : surfdens ] , @xmath147 and @xmath35 , we now obtain    @xmath148    figure  [ fig : ionispar ] plots the predicted @xmath142 at the radius measured by the spectral fitting of @xcite , assuming it is illuminated by the luminosity plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : loverledd ] . following the results of ",
    "[ sect : heating ] , we have also assumed @xmath149 .",
    "overplotted on the figure are the measured values of the ionization parameter as inferred from the spectral fitting .",
    "in contrast to the expectations of @xcite , the disk does not have to be overionized by the burst .",
    "rather , figure  [ fig : ionispar ] shows that the predicted @xmath142 is generally much smaller than the measured one , especially near the beginning of the superburst .",
    "a simple way to bring the theoretical prediction of @xmath142 in line with the measured one is to have a variable surface density which is @xmath150 times smaller over the first @xmath9  s , but then becomes only @xmath151 times smaller a couple of hours later , as the burst is decaying .",
    "of course , increasing the scale height also results in a larger @xmath142 .",
    "the exact behavior of how the surface density would evolve as a function of radius and burst luminosity would have to be calculated with a numerical simulation .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : ionispar ] shows that the predicted @xmath142 follows the same trend as those inferred from the spectral fitting , supporting the ionized reflection interpretation of the observed spectral features .",
    "there are additional dynamical effects that arise in bursting systems that could affect the accretion flow .",
    "for example , while models of pre bursts show that the luminosity from the photosphere will barely exceed the eddington limit , they also indicate that winds will be driven from the surface of the star @xcite .",
    "thus , while the burst radiation may not blow away the disk , there may be a mechanical interaction between the stellar wind and the accretion flow .",
    "however , the outflows generally carry very little kinetic energy compared to the radiative energy released in the burst , so any mechanical interaction is unlikely to be significant . secondly , the x - ray heated gas on the disk surface will want to move to larger radii due to the gas pressure gradient as well as radiation pressure .",
    "this tendency to rotate at larger radii will be counteracted by viscous transport within the hot gas and radiative drag .",
    "therefore , there may be some interesting dynamics within the disk as a response to x - ray bursts .",
    "modeling of the reflection features in the spectra of the 4u  182030superburst showed that there was little to no reflection within a radius of @xmath152  @xmath5 @xcite , much larger than the innermost stable circular orbit at @xmath153  @xmath5 .",
    "one explanation for this apparently truncated accretion flow is locally enhanced accretion due to poynting - robertson drag (   [ sect : inflow ] ) .",
    "alternatively , this radius may correspond to the magnetospheric radius , @xmath154 , where the magnetic pressure from the neutron star s magnetic field is equal to the gas ram pressure in the accretion flow . within @xmath154",
    "the dynamics of the accreting gas is dominated by the magnetic field , and therefore the disk may be easily disrupted into a configuration which is unlikely to produce reflection features .",
    "the magnetospheric radius is @xcite @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the magnetic moment of the stellar field ( assuming dipole geometry ) . substituting @xmath157  m@xmath16 and @xmath158  g  s@xmath18 , and taking @xmath159  @xmath5 , we find that @xmath160  g  @xmath161 , or @xmath162",
    "g. this is a reasonable field strength for a non - pulsating lmxb system @xcite .",
    "in fact , almost all systems which exhibit x - ray bursts , and lmxbs in general , do not show x - ray pulsations @xcite , implying much weaker field strengths then pulsars ( which have @xmath163  g ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the lack of x - ray reflection from within @xmath152  @xmath5 may be due to magnetic truncation .",
    "the superburst from 4u  182030  occurred when the system was being observed by _",
    "rxte_. as a result , the sensitive narrow - band instruments onboard were able to pick up the reflection features and track their evolution as the burst evolved .",
    "so far only one other system has been as fortunate ( 4u  163653 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "superbursts are the ideal events for which to search for x - ray reflection features from the accretion disk as they last for a number of hours . moreover , because of this long timescale , the analyses presented in this paper predict that we are more likely to observe changes to the accretion disk during superbursts than during the much shorter type  i x - ray bursts .",
    "the major difficulty is the unknown recurrence time of superbursts which can vary over a number of years depending on the composition of the accreted material @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we suggest that rapid x - ray followup of superbursts would be an important secondary science objective for the _ swift _ mission",
    ". detecting reflection features from a variety of systems with different orbital and spin periods , magnetic field strengths and evolutionary paths would allow examination of the accretion process over a wide parameter space .    as the overall geometry is the same and",
    "the light travel time is much shorter than the burst duration , x - ray reflection features should be produced in type i bursts as well .",
    "the difficulty will be detecting them with sensitive enough instruments to do time averaged spectral analysis let alone time - resolved studies .",
    "however , type i events are much more common than superbursts allowing repeatable experiments and tests of hypotheses .",
    "sensitive spectral analysis of type  i x - ray bursts would be an important objective for a future high - throughput observatory .",
    "type i x - ray bursts or superbursts on neutron stars produce a significant amount of energy ( @xmath164 or @xmath165  ergs , respectively ) in a short amount of time . in this paper , we have discussed how this energy , in the form of a x - ray flux , would affect the surrounding accretion flow .",
    "the goal was to elucidate the meaning behind the apparent evolution of the accretion disk uncovered by @xcite in their analysis of x - ray reflection features observed during the 4u  182030  superburst .",
    "three separate physical processes were considered .",
    "the first , radiatively driven winds , was found to be occur , but only for @xmath68 and , for a thin accretion disc , the predicted outflow rate was less than the accretion rate , so this effect may not produce a large change to the accretion flow .",
    "poynting - robertson drag , the second process , was in fact predicted to be too efficient , and would have removed the inner accretion disk is less than a second .",
    "this was the result of using a too simple description of the problem , but poynting - robertson may be dominant very close to the central star .",
    "the final process considered was a change in surface density due to x - ray heating .",
    "this successfully reproduced the observed timescale for a shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter of @xmath166@xmath2 , but requires the _ ansatz _ that the x - ray heating will result in significant changes to the surface density of the disk that would propagate on a viscous time .",
    "our conclusion is that , while the x - ray heating may dominate the explanation of the observations , all three processes will be ongoing during a superburst , and numerical simulations are required to fully understand the response of the accretion disk to such large explosions .",
    "finally , we emphasize that future rapid follow - up observations of x - ray bursts ( both super and otherwise ) will be vital in the progress of this problem .",
    "x - ray reflection features should be common in these systems and any observed changes are likely to correspond to changes in the accretion flow .",
    "further examples are needed to test the ideas presented here as well as provide constraints on accretion theory .",
