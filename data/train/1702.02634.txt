    "multi - carrier code division multiple access ( mc - cdma ) is a multi - access scheme based on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) method . since its invention",
    ", mc - cdma has attracted broad interest , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "mc - cdma naturally integrates cdma s flexible multiuser access with interference suppression capability and the advantages of multicarrier ofdm , including robustness against frequency - selective fading .",
    "therefore , it has the potential to be one of the candidates to support massive access and provide reliable data communication and better coverage for future - generation wireless systems .",
    "as in all cdma systems , mc - cdma may experience severe multi - access interference due to the loss of user orthogonality , which may occur , particularly , in frequency - selective channel environments . for such systems",
    ", optimal detection entails an exponential number of hypothesis testings about data symbols of all users and thus could be computationally demanding , time - consuming and even infeasible in a large system with conventional dense signature design . to circumvent the complexity issue , sparse signatures ,",
    "whose fraction of non - zero entries is small , have been introduced and exploited for the cdma uplink multi - user detection  @xcite . in particular , the belief - propagation algorithm has been proposed for such a system , an algorithm that has a natural implementation using parallel computation units , and one that is fast and provably optimal for different ensembles of sparse signatures in the large system limits @xcite . inspired by the belief - propagation algorithm ,",
    "references  @xcite and @xcite have developed reduced - complexity soft - in soft - out ( siso ) and turbo iterative multiuser detection algorithms for the sparse cdma uplink and a sparse - signature ofdm uplink , respectively .    in this work",
    ", we formulate a different problem , appropriate for the mc - cdma downlink counterpart , from the symbol detection point of view . the solution to the problem",
    "provides a power - efficient precoding algorithm for the base station ( bs ) .",
    "the precoding is implemented at the bs , allowing the mobile stations ( mss ) to use simple conventional single - user matched filters and standard single - user symbol detection .",
    "this hence simplifies the implementation of the receiver , as compared to the conventional mc - cdma downlink transceiver design , where multi - user interference is normally mitigated by a frequency - domain equalization at the receiver  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the proposed algorithm optimizes the signals transmitted on different subcarriers so that they can be constructively combined at each receiver , leading to a power - efficient precoding .",
    "the use of random sparse signatures was suggested for the mc - cdma downlink in @xcite to allow low - complexity iterative multiuser detection at each ms .",
    "but here we show that sparsity can be exploited to reduce the complexity of the precoding , as compared to mc - cdma with dense signatures .",
    "in addition , using sparse signatures simplifies channel measurement , since each ms only needs to estimate channels for a small number of subcarriers it occupies .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we introduce the mc - cdma downlink communication with regular sparse signatures , where each ms has access to an equal number of subcarriers and each subcarrier has ( roughly ) equal load .",
    "we also consider a bipartite graph representation for the system studied and use it to facilitate algorithm design and complexity analysis . *",
    "assume that data symbols intended for mss are drawn from discrete alphabets .",
    "we take the symbol detection point of view and introduce the minimum symbol error probability ( sep ) as a quality of service ( qos ) metric for each ms .",
    "we formulate the precoding problem as a transmit power optimization problem subject to minimum sep requirements at mss .",
    "we translate the sep targets into constraint regions on noiseless received signal components at mss and characterize them via a conservative approximation to make the problem tractable .",
    "detailed formulation procedures are provided for systems with both standard 4/16-qam constellations and tomlinson - harashima replica points .",
    "* we develop a precoding algorithm that accommodates parallel computation units via the dual - decomposition theory .",
    "aided by the graph representation of the system , the complexity of the algorithm is characterized in terms of the number of message passings between computation units and the number of additions and multiplications for precoding calculation .",
    "signature sparsity is shown to play a vital role in reducing precoding complexity .",
    "* we demonstrate that the proposed optimized precoding generally outperforms the conventional zero - forcing ( zf ) and the optimized regularized zf ( rzf ) precodings in terms of power efficiency under the same sep requirements .",
    "the exact gain depends on the system load and it is very significant for a fully loaded system . we also demonstrate that , for a fixed system load , sparse mc - cdma , e.g. , with a proper relatively small number of subcarriers allocated to each ms , attains almost the same power efficiency and link throughput as dense mc - cdma under our proposed precoding scheme . this important observation , in conjunction with the fact that sparsity reduces precoding complexity , promotes the practicality of sparse mc - cdma .",
    "precoding is a relatively mature concept in multi - antenna communication systems , enabling multiuser multiplexing in the spatial domain , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it has to balance between the two conflicting interests of maximizing the useful signal power at the intended user and minimizing interference leakage towards non - intended users .",
    "the same concept can be applied to other systems such as direct - sequence cdma or mc - cdma , where multiplexing takes place in the time- or frequency - domain , and multi - access interference , if it arises , has to be dealt with @xcite .",
    "existing precoding techniques can be divided into two categories , linear precoding and non - linear precoding , where both require channel state information while the latter requires additional symbol - based processing .",
    "within the first category , matched filtering , zf and rzf @xcite are three commonly known precodings that maintain different levels of balance between the two conflicting goals .",
    "other power - aware linear precodings of general form have also been proposed in the literature subject to different qos metrics , such as signal - to - noise - plus - interference ratio  @xcite .",
    "compared with linear precoding , non - linear precoding may offer higher power efficiency and transmission rate , but the gain comes at the cost of incorporating more sophisticated signal processing @xcite . in the multi - antenna broadcasting setup , capacity - achieving non - linear dirty - paper coding ( dpc )",
    "entails a successive pre - cancelation of known intra - user interference at the bs .",
    "the encoding of data relies on codewords of infinite length and involves a high - dimensional sphere - search algorithm , which renders dpc unattractive in practical systems .",
    "tomlinson - harashima precoding ( thp ) is a simplified version of dpc , where the codebook is comprised of periodic extension of standard constellations ( replica points ) in the two - dimensional space and a transmit modulo - operation is introduced in the interference pre - cancelation process in order to reduce transmit power .",
    "built on zf or rzf , reference  @xcite generalizes the single - user - based symbol extension idea of thp and introduces a joint perturbation of user symbol vector to further reduce transmit power .",
    "the optimized precoding proposed in this work belongs to the second category .",
    "as in existing works , power consumption is one of the primary concerns in our optimized precoding .",
    "however , the optimization criterion , minimum sep constraint , has not been considered before , except our own works @xcite in the mimo ( or distributed mimo ) setup .",
    "this criterion appears to be natural when we consider a system with discrete alphabets as inputs .",
    "in addition , in our formulation , we fix the information - bearing alphabets at the bs but allow a certain relaxation of received signals at mss through precoding , as long as they reside in detection - favorable regions and the sep targets are met .",
    "this is distinguished from related works @xcite , where non - linear relaxation of input alphabets has been adopted . in @xcite , the relaxation is required to maintain the minimum signalling distance , while in @xcite , the relaxation is to ensure the corresponding symbol - energy - to - noise ratio is above a certain threshold @xcite .",

    "[ fig : graph : representation ] depicts an instance of the graph @xmath57 for @xmath58 , where each osn is connected with two psns .",
    "we use @xmath59 to denote the collection of osns connected to @xmath56 and define the node degree of @xmath56 as the cardinality @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath61 to denote the collection of psns connected to @xmath45 and define the node degree of @xmath45 as the cardinality @xmath62 . this graph representation introduced",

    ", we assume that the non - zero elements @xmath63 are i.i.d . drawn from a uniform distribution on @xmath64 .",
    "it is observed that generating non - zero elements according to other distributions , e.g. , gaussian distribution , has little impact on the averaged system performance .",
    "hence , we stick to the binary uniform distribution , which leads to a binary phase - offset for the symbol transmitted as in @xcite .    depending on the number of subcarriers allocated across mss and the load per subcarrier , we have three common signature ensembles suggested for the uplink @xcite : _ i _ ) irregular ensemble , where poisson - distributed number of subcarriers are allocated across mss and the load per subcarrier is also poisson - distributed ; _ ii _ ) semi - regular ensemble , where each ms is allocated a fixed positive integer number of subcarriers and the load per subcarrier is poisson - distributed ; and _ iii _ ) regular ensemble , where the number of subcarriers allocated for each ms and the loading per subcarrier both take fixed positive integer values . in particular ,",
    "@xcite advocates the regular ensemble as it amongst others prevents the systematic inefficiency due to leaving some subcarriers unoccupied by any of mss .    in this work ,",
    "we follow @xcite and deploy the regular - type ensemble to ensure that the system enjoys full utilization of resources and provides user fairness .",
    "specifically , when the system is fully - loaded ( @xmath65 ) , a perfectly regular signature matrix is randomly generated in the sense that each ms is allocated @xmath66 subcarriers , and each subcarrier is accessed by exactly @xmath66 mss .",
    "when the system is under - loaded ( @xmath67 ) , a nearly regular signature matrix is randomly generated such that each ms is allocated @xmath66 subcarriers , and each subcarrier is of almost equal load , namely , accessed by either @xmath68 or @xmath69 mss .",
    "for notational convenience , we define @xmath70 as the noiseless received component at ms @xmath25 ( @xmath71 is the @xmath25th row of matrix @xmath50 ) with real part @xmath72 and imaginary part @xmath73 ; similarly , denote the real and imaginary parts of data symbol and noise as @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "in addition , define @xmath78 as the fixed noise variance per signal dimension .",
    "assuming that all data symbols transmitted are selected from discrete alphabets , we take a symbol detection point of view and impose minimum symbol error probabilities ( seps ) as the user qos constraints .",
    "specifically , let @xmath79 denote the decision region associated with data symbol @xmath33 intended for ms @xmath25 and @xmath80 denote the sep target .",
    "detection error happens when the output signal @xmath45 lies outside decision region @xmath79 . according to the sep requirement",
    ", the probability of error events should be no greater than the target , i.e. , @xmath81    a question we then ask is : how do we design a precoder that efficiently maps a symbol vector @xmath35 into a precoded vector @xmath82 such that the sep requirements at mss can be met ?    following the conventional zero - forcing ( zf ) approach , one could form @xmath82 according to @xmath83 which inverts the channel matrix and forces noiseless component @xmath84 to sit exactly at the constellation point @xmath33 . in order to meet a given sep target , @xmath80",
    ", data symbol @xmath33 has to be chosen from a discrete alphabet set whose minimum distance between any two neighboring points ( denoted by @xmath85 ) is above a certain threshold .",
    "for instance , consider a system with @xmath20-qam modulation whose standard constellation is represented by @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "we need to scale the constellation points ( increasing the minimum distance @xmath85 , but also the transmit power ) in order to meet the sep target , @xmath80 . considering the 4-qam constellation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4:qam ] ) , the scaling factor , @xmath88 , to use for ms @xmath25 , must satisfy @xmath89 as implied by .",
    "thus the minimum scaling factor under the conventional zf approach for the 4-qam system is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the inverse of the standard @xmath92-function @xcite .",
    "when @xmath93 ( see fig .  [ fig:16:qam ] for 16-qam ) , the standard constellation @xmath94 should be scaled so that @xmath95 as implied by , considering the dominant scenario in which one of the inner most points is transmitted .",
    "thus the minimum scaling factor under the conventional zf approach is given by @xmath96    in general , however , we do not have to zero - force @xmath97 , and in fact , it is sufficient to ensure @xmath97 falls into a region that favours correct symbol detection .",
    "this relaxation introduces room to optimize the choice of @xmath82 , leading to the following transmit power minimization problem : @xmath98",
    "in this section , we show how to translate the set of sep targets in   into constraints on noiseless output components at mss .",
    "in particular , we begin with the 4-qam signaling case and then generalize to the 16-qam signaling case .",
    "a similar approach can be applied to systems with higher - order qam constellations .",
    "assume that each @xmath33 is drawn from the 4-qam constellation set @xmath99 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4:qam ] , where the green dashed lines partition the complex plane into four symmetric decision regions each occupying an open quarter plane . any received signals falling outside the correct region lead to detection error .",
    "thus , the sep requirement becomes @xmath100 where the tuple @xmath101 depends on the data transmitted and equals :    a.   @xmath102 for @xmath103 ; b.   @xmath104 for @xmath105 ; c.   @xmath106 for @xmath107 ; d.   @xmath108 for @xmath109 .    given symbol @xmath110 and a target @xmath80",

    "the constraint region @xmath125 then includes all the points on and within the boundary ( see the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:4:qam ] ) .",
    "note that point @xmath130 is exactly a scaled constellation point .",
    "also note that this region generally implies non - linear constraints on input signal @xmath82 , which makes the optimization problem less tractable .",
    "alternatively , we can find a polytype contained in @xmath125 , i.e. , we conservatively approximate the region using the area bounded by line segments between a finite number of points on or within boundary . a simple approximation for @xmath131",

    "note that the exact areas of these regions only depend on the sep targets .",
    "we now turn to the case where @xmath33 is drawn from the 16-qam constellation set @xmath140 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:16:qam ] .",
    "the constraint region on @xmath141 can be characterized based on procedures similar to those for the 4-qam case .",

    "potential benefits can be accrued from the resulting enlarged feasible region . however , when the corner points are transmitted , the corresponding constraint regions always shrink as the constellation is scaled up . in this case , power efficiency loss may be induced because of the reduced feasible optimization space .",

    "most of these algorithms are designed for centralized implementation and could be efficient enough for a small - scale problem . however , as the problem dimension increases , the computational complexity may be prohibitive .",
    "more importantly , the sparsity inherent to the problem may not be well exploited in standard solvers . given these observations",
    ", we are interested in developing a precoding algorithm that leverages the sparsity to reduce complexity and is suitable for solving large - dimension problems using parallel computation units .",
    "these units may correspond to parallel processor cores ( threads ) at the bs computer @xcite or parallel processors at the cloud to which the bs is connected @xcite .",
    "we now detail the precoding algorithm with a focus on the general problem as if all inequalities and equalities in were activated .",
    "the key technique is the dual decomposition approach , see , e.g. , @xcite . recalling the graph representation @xmath57 introduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : graph : representation ] ) , we can map all psns and osns to parallel computation units .",
    "we start with forming the lagrangian function : @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are lagrangian multipliers ( dual variables ) , among which each pair of primal variables @xmath203}$ ] is associated with psn computation unit @xmath29 ( @xmath204 ) , while each tuple of dual variables @xmath205 } , { \\bm \\nu}_{[2k-1:2k]}\\}$ ] is associated with osn computation unit @xmath25 ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "the dual problem is then defined as @xmath207 with @xmath208 being the dual objective function",
    ".    then one can solve the original problem by finding the optimal dual variables in an iterative manner . specifically , at the @xmath209th iteration , for fixed dual variables @xmath210 and @xmath211 , to attain the minimization of lagrangian , one sets the first - order derivative of the lagrangian to zero , which leads to @xmath212 or more explicitly , @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 denote the collection of indices of dual variables @xmath216 and @xmath217 that have interactions with @xmath218 , respectively , according to the graph @xmath57 .",

    "in particular , the boundary of the region is determined by the equality @xmath230 in  . in the following ,",
