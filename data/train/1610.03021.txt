    "in the last years , metamaterials have generated a huge interest among communities of physicists and mathematicians , owing to their extraordinary properties such as negative refraction @xcite , allowing the design of spectacular devices like the perfect flat lens @xcite or the cylindrical cloak in @xcite .",
    "such properties result from the possibility of creating artificially microscopic structures whose macroscopic electromagnetic behavior amounts to negative electric permittivity @xmath0 and/or negative magnetic permeability @xmath1 within some frequency range .",
    "such a phenomenon can also be observed in metals in the optical frequency range @xcite : in this case one says that this material is _ a negative material _ @xcite .",
    "thanks to these negative electromagnetic coefficients , waves can propagate at the interface between such a negative material and a usual dielectric material @xcite .",
    "these waves , often called _ surface plasmon polaritons _ , are localized near the interface and allow then to propagate signals in the same way as in an optical fiber , which may lead to numerous physical applications .",
    "mathematicians have so far little explored these negative materials and most studies in this context are devoted to the frequency domain , that is , propagation of time - harmonic waves @xcite . in particular , it is now well understood that in the case of a smooth interface between a dielectric and a negative material ( both assumed non - dissipative ) , the time - harmonic maxwell s equations become ill - posed if both ratios of @xmath0 and @xmath1 across the interface are equal to @xmath2 which is precisely the conditions required for the perfect lens in @xcite .",
    "this result raises a fundamental issue which can be seen as the starting point of the present paper .    indeed , for numerous scattering problems",
    ", a time - harmonic wave represents the large time asymptotic behavior of a time - dependent wave resulting from a time - harmonic excitation which is switched on at an initial time .",
    "such a property is referred to as the _ limiting amplitude principle _ in the context of scattering theory .",
    "it has been proved for a large class of physical problems in acoustics , electromagnetism or elastodynamics @xcite .",
    "but what can be said about the large time behavior of the time - dependent wave if the frequency of the excitation is such that the time - harmonic problem becomes ill - posed , that is , precisely in the situation described above ?",
    "what is the effect of the surface plasmons on the large time behavior ?",
    "our aim is to give a precise answer to these questions in an elementary situation .    to reach this goal ,",
    "several approaches are possible .",
    "the one we adopt here , which is based on spectral theory , has its own interest because it provides us a very powerful tool to represent time - dependent waves and study their behavior , not only for large time asymptotics .",
    "our aim is to make the spectral analysis of a simple model of interface between a negative material and the vacuum , more precisely to construct a _",
    "generalized fourier transform _ for this model , which is the keystone for a time  frequency analysis .",
    "indeed this transform amounts to a _ generalized eigenfunction expansion _ of any possible state of the system , which yields a representation of time - dependent waves as superpositions of time - harmonic waves . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", this transform offers a _",
    "diagonal _ form of the operator that describes the dynamics of the system .",
    "the existence of such a transform is ensured in a very general context @xcite , but its practical construction highly depends of the considered model .",
    "the situation studied here consists in the basic case of a plane interface between the vacuum and a negative material filling respectively two half - spaces .",
    "our negative material is described by a non - dissipative drude model , which is the simplest model of negative material .",
    "the technique we use to construct the generalized fourier transform is inspired by previous studies in the context of stratified media @xcite . compared to these studies , the difficulty of the present work relies in the fact that in the drude material , @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend on the frequency and become negative for low frequencies . for the sake of simplicity , instead of considering the complete three - dimensional physical problem , we restrict ourselves to the so - called transverse electric ( te ) two - dimensional problem , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the electric field is orthogonal to the plane of propagation .",
    "the transverse magnetic ( tm ) case can be studied similarly .",
    "as shown in @xcite , in stratified media , the spectral theory of the three - dimensional problem follows from both te and tm cases , but is not dealt with here .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the construction of the generalized fourier transform of the te maxwell s equations .",
    "it will be used in a forthcoming paper @xcite to study the validity of a limiting amplitude principle in our medium , but the results we obtain in the present paper are not limited to this purpose .",
    "the generalized fourier transform is also the main tool to study scattering problems as in @xcite , numerical methods in stratified media as in @xcite and has many other applications . in",
    "let us mention that both present and forthcoming papers are an advanced version of the preliminary study presented in @xcite .",

    "[ s - mod - meth ] , we introduce the above mentioned plane interface problem between a drude material and the vacuum , more precisely the te maxwell s equations . these equations are formulated as a conservative schrdinger equation in a hilbert space , which involves a self - adjoint hamiltonian .",
    "we briefly recall some basic notions of spectral theory which are used throughout the paper .",
    "section [ s - spec - th - ak ] is the core of our study : we take advantage of the invariance of our medium in the direction of the interface to reduce the spectral analysis of our hamiltonian to the analysis of a family of one - dimensional _",
    "reduced hamiltonians_. we diagonalize each of them by constructing a adapted generalized fourier transform .",
    "we finally bring together in  [ s - spec - th - a ] this family of results to construct a generalized fourier transform for our initial hamiltonian and conclude by a spectral representation of the solution to our schrdinger equation .",
