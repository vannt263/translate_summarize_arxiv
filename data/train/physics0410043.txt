    "the density functional theory ( dft ) has a important problem with the calculation of transition metal complexes . in spite of the recent development of the exchange - correlation functionals , it is difficult to evaluate the multiplet energies using the kohn - sham method , because these electronic structures are not always written in a single slater determinant .",
    "several methods have been proposed to calculate the multiplet energies using dft .",
    "one of these methods has been proposed by ziegler @xcite , wood @xcite and von barth @xcite .",
    "they have carried out the computation of the multiplet energies using the diagonal sum rule , in which the sum of the multiplet energies is equal to the corresponding sum of the single determinant energies .",
    "the method reproduces the multiplet energies of p electron system , but the method does not give correct multiplet energies for the d electron system .",
    "@xcite    the time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) has been recently developed to calculate excited states including the multiplet states .",
    "the method has been applied to p electron systems @xcite within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the non - adiabatic tddft calculation , in which the exchange - correlation kernel becomes frequency dependent , is still difficult .",
    "another method was formally discussed in the grling s paper @xcite in which the energy functional depends on the multiplet states .",
    "they applied the optimized effective potential method to the calculation of the multiplet energies of p electron atoms .",
    "@xcite the optimized effective potential method ( opm ) was firstly proposed by sharp and horton@xcite .",
    "the method was applied to the neon and carbon atoms by talman et .",
    "grling pointed out that opm is formally regarded as dft because the orbital dependent energy functional implicitly depends on the density @xcite .",
    "the opm potential can be evaluated by the singular integral equation called as the opm equation .",
    "talman et .",
    "al.@xcite and engel et .",
    "al.@xcite solved the one - dimensional opm equation for an atom , in which the angular components of the opm equation for an atom are integrated out using the spherical symmetry . to efficiently calculate the opm potentials for atoms and molecules , grling et .",
    "al . expanded the opm potential using some base functions .",
    "@xcite the base expansion method gives the same total energy as calculated by talman s method .",
    "however , in the base expansion method , the opm potential shows spurious oscillations . to solve the problem ,",
    "some methods have been proposed but still are not applied to d electron atoms . @xcite    an early work of opm for the multiplet states is the opm calculation by aashamar @xcite who applied opm to the ground multiplet of the atom of which atomic number is less than 85 .",
    "the opm potentials for the p electron ground and excited state multiplets are calculated by nagy @xcite using the kli method.@xcite furthermore , aashamar also applied opm to the multiplet energies of p electron atoms using the multi - configuration hf form .",
    "@xcite the total energies of the multiplet states have been discussed in these studies , but the potentials of the multiplet states are not presented .",
    "sala and grling have been developed the lhf method to approximately calculate the exchange only opm potential .",
    "@xcite recently , the lhf method is extended to the open shell atoms and molecules.@xcite they applied the lhf method to the ground and excited multiplets of p electron atoms and molecules .",
    "however , in these papers , they did not treat the excited multiplet energies of the d electron atoms , which are difficult to calculate using the dft .",
    "furthermore , these studies give incorrect result caused by the approximation methods such as the kli or the lhf method .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply opm to the ground and excited state multiplets of the 3d@xmath0 electron atoms using the total energy functional of the single - configuration hf @xcite form . following talman and engel@xcite ,",
    "we solve the one - dimensional opm equation correctly .",
    "the solution is considered to give the most reliable result among all the available methods .",
    "we show that the differences between the opm potentials of the multiplet states can be approximated by the linear combination of the potentials derived from @xmath1,@xmath2 slater integrals .",
    "we numerically show that the opm exchange potential of multiplet state is approximated by the linear combination of the opm exchange potentials of the single determinants .",
    "in the present paper , we calculate the opm potential for eigenstates of an transition metal atom .",
    "each state is characterized by a definite value of the total orbital angular momentum @xmath3 and of the total spin angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "these multiplet energies can be expressed as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the seniority number .",
    "the multiplet energy level is degenerate for possible directions of total momentums @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "then , each multiplet wavefunction @xmath7 can be written as a linear combination of single slater determinant functions @xmath8 which are not always eigenfunctions of the atom . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11 component of the total momentums @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and @xmath12 specifies different states with the same @xmath9 and @xmath10 component . each total energy of the single determinant is represented as @xmath13 .",

    "<S> firstly , the difference between opm exchange potentials of the multiplet states can be approximated by the linear combination of the potentials derived from the slater integrals @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the average energy of the configuration . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the opm exchange potential can be expressed as the linear combination of the opm exchange potentials of the single determinants . </S>"
