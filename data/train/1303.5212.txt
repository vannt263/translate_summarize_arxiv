    "localization of massless gauge fields on a domain wall with @xmath0 dimensional world volume has been a long - standing problem to achieve the dynamical compactification in the brane - world scenario @xcite .",
    "if the gauge symmetry is unbroken only inside the domain wall and broken outside , the gauge field inevitably acquires a mass proportional to the inverse of the width of the wall @xcite .",
    "the localization of gauge fields can be achieved if the gauge theory is in the confining phase outside of the domain wall @xcite .",
    "this requirement can be translated into a position - dependent gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric gauge theories in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions allows a cubic coupling @xcite between adjoint scalar fields @xmath2 and gauge field strengths @xmath3 @xmath4 with coupling constants @xmath5 . in ref.@xcite , a domain wall solution",
    "is chosen so that the scalar field @xmath6 is positive inside and vanishes asymptotically outside of the domain wall . in this way ,",
    "non - abelian gauge fields have been localized on the domain wall . more recently a method to localize non - abelian gauge fields together with minimally interacting matter fields on domain walls has been introduced and a particular model has been presented in five - dimensional spacetime @xcite , by gauging the unbroken global symmetry associated to the degenerate scalar fields to form the domain wall @xcite . this mechanism provides a step towards a realistic model of branes as soliton solutions of higher dimensional field theories , and realizes one of the most important characteristics of d - branes : massless @xmath7 gauge fields emerge when @xmath8 walls are coincident , and become massive as walls separate .     of two separated kinks ( left panel ) . ]     of two separated kinks ( left panel ) . ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two real scalar fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 were introduced to form the usual kink profile in the extra - dimensional coordinate @xmath11 as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , and the cubic coupling in eq.([eq : general_cubic_coupling ] ) is chosen as @xmath12 , \\label{eq : cs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the non - abelian gauge field strength to be localized on the domain wall . in this way , one achieved the desired profile of the position - dependent coupling which is positive and vanishes asymptotically outside of the domain wall as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig:01 ] .",
    "more recently , matter fields have also been localized on the domain wall interacting minimally with the localized gauge fields @xcite .",
    "although the model realized the localization mechanism in a simple setup , the width of the position - dependent coupling is a modulus and can become negative implying an instability of the gauge kinetic term .",
    "moduli of domain walls arise as remaining degrees of freedom of scalar fields constrained by gauge symmetry to form the domain wall .",
    "this observation prompts us to construct a model with smaller number of scalar fields with a different charge assignments in order to eliminate the unwanted modulus in the position - dependent coupling @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present models in @xmath1 dimensional spacetime with domain wall solutions which allow stable localized gauge fields interacting minimally with localized matter fields . for any values of the moduli parameters ,",
    "we show that the position - dependent gauge coupling is positive everywhere in the extra - dimensional coordinate @xmath11 . in particular , its width is no longer a modulus and is fixed by the parameters of the theory .",
    "we thus find that the gauge kinetic term is stable for all values of moduli , namely for all possible domain wall configurations . as localized matter fields ,",
    "we obtain scalar fields in singlet and adjoint representations of the gauge group .",
    "they are associated with the broken part of the global symmetry , and interact minimally with the localized gauge fields .",
    "the effective lagrangian on the domain wall is also worked out , using the method in ref.@xcite .",
    "it resembles the chiral lagrangian associated with the chiral symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "a new feature of the effective lagrangian is that the coupling strength of the adjoint matter fields is larger than that of the singlet matter fields .",
    "we examine generality of models with a stable kinetic term for gauge fields to identify the class of models with desirable properties .",
    "we also discuss ways to build more realistic models for a phenomenology of the brane - world scenario .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to construct a model in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions with domain wall solutions which localizes matter and gauge fields .",
    "the position - dependent gauge coupling is shown to be positive . in section 3",
    ", the low - energy effective lagrangian is obtained . in section 4",
    ", we examine the generality of models with the stable gauge kinetic term . conclusion and discussion",
    "are in section 5 .",
    "some details to derive the low - energy effective lagrangian is given in appendix a. in appendix b , we summarize geometrical features of the three - flavor model .",
    "in this section we first present a model allowing the domain wall solution with unbroken non - abelian global symmetry @xcite . as the second step , we introduce non - abelian gauge fields for the unbroken symmetry . as the third step",
    ", we consider the cubic coupling @xcite in eq.([eq : general_cubic_coupling ] ) to localize non - abelian gauge fields : we use expectation values of a singlet scalar field to give the position - dependent gauge coupling , whose positivity is demonstrated for any values of moduli parameters .",
    "a broken part of the global symmetry provides matter fields in singlet and adjoint representations of the localized gauge fields @xcite .",
    "let us consider a five - dimensional @xmath14 gauge theory and @xmath8 scalar fields @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in the fundamental representation with the degenerate mass @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , together with a singlet scalar field @xmath19 , whose charge assignments are summarized in tab .",
    "[ table:01 ]",
    ". therefore we obtain global symmetry @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , we introduce adjoint and singlet scalars @xmath6 and @xmath21 associated with the gauge group @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .       since we are interested in the domain wall solutions , it is enough to consider the strong gauge coupling limit where gauge theories become non - linear sigma models ( nlsm ) , whose target space is defined as an intersection of two spaces as @xmath24 here @xmath25 stands for the two dimensional hyperbolic plane . in the above expression , the @xmath26 and @xmath25 are defined by @xmath27 this space is isomorphic to @xmath26 but it is a squashed sphere .",
    "the metric can be read from the khler potential @xmath28 one can eliminate the real superfields @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and find the following expression of the khler potential with respect to the gauge invariant inhomogeneous coordinate @xmath31 as @xmath32,\\\\ f & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lambda - |\\varphi|^2   + \\sqrt{4|\\varphi|^2(1+\\lambda ) + \\left(\\lambda - |\\varphi|^2\\right)^2}\\right),\\\\ \\varphi & = & \\frac{h_2h_3}{c_1h_1},\\quad \\lambda \\equiv \\frac{c_2}{c_1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this manifold is singular at @xmath33 when @xmath34 . this can be understood in two different ways .",
    "the first one is to realize the fact that @xmath23 gauge symmetry is restored at that point .",
    "this is because @xmath35 holds there .",
    "namely , the additional massless degrees of freedom should be taken into account .",
    "the second way is more straightforward .",
    "let us calculate the scalar curvature in the vicinity of @xmath36 . to this end",
    ", first we change the coordinate by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , then we obtain @xmath39 from this it is clear that the scalar curvature at @xmath36 becomes infinity when @xmath40 .    0 s.  l.  dubovsky and v.  a.  rubakov , int",
