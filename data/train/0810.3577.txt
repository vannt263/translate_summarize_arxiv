    "galaxy collisions and mergers have long been known to influence star formation in galaxies ( see , e.g. , the review by struck 1999 and references therein ) and likely play a fundamental role in the transformation of the population of gas - rich spiral galaxies at high redshift into the spheroidal and elliptical galaxies that dominate dense galaxy groups and clusters at the present epoch .",
    "probing the details of the gravitational and hydrodynamical processes that affect star formation during these collisions has only recently become possible with the advent of high spatial resolution observations that are capable of resolving star - forming complexes within nearby galaxies across the full electromagnetic spectrum ( radio to x - ray ) , and that allow us to measure the thermodynamic properties of cold and hot gas in and around these galaxies .",
    "early studies of star formation in interacting galaxies were based primarily on observations in the optical and far - infrared wavebands .",
    "these studies focused on global star formation properties and correlations between observable star formation indicators .",
    "for example , kennicutt et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) found that h@xmath9 emission and far - infrared to blue luminosity ratios were enhanced in interacting galaxies compared to galaxies in non - interacting samples .",
    "more recent optical studies using large area redshift surveys suggest h@xmath9 equivalent widths may be correlated with galaxy pair separation ( e.g. , barton et  al .",
    "2000 using the second cfa redshift survey ; lambas et  al .",
    "2003 using the 2df survey ; nikolic , cullen & alexander 2004 using the sdss survey ) . however , extinction in the optical wavebands and dust heating by evolved agb stars in the far - infrared made global star formation activity in galaxies difficult to measure , and contributed to the large scatter in these relationships .",
    "studies of individual star - forming regions within interacting galaxies were largely limited to optical wavebands , because of the low spatial resolution of the far - infrared data . from these optical studies , the spatial distributions and masses of star forming clumps were found to be diverse . while star formation was often enhanced in the nuclear region of the dominant galaxy of an interacting galaxy pair , star formation was also prevalent at large radii in extended tidal features .",
    "masses of these star - forming clumps span more than six orders in magnitude , from young ( @xmath10myr old ) @xmath11 star associations , that may rapidly dissolve ( werk et  al .",
    "2008 ) , to bound @xmath12 systems , with masses similar to globular clusters ( trancho et  al .",
    "2007 ) , and @xmath13 systems , sometimes called tidal dwarf galaxies . with the launch of the spitzer space telescope ( werner et  al .",
    "2004 ) , high spatial resolution mid - infrared imaging and spectroscopy of star - forming regions within nearby galaxies became possible .",
    "using mid - infrared luminosities and colors , nonstellar emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , excited by newly formed stars in dusty regions , could be separated from the diffuse starlight and the silicate emission expected from evolved stars , thus completing the census of global star formation in the galaxy . with the high angular resolution of the _ spitzer _ infra - red array camera ( irac ; fazio et  al .",
    "2004 ) , subtle differences in the star - forming clumps could be probed as a function of their spatial distribution within the interacting system .",
    "most recent mid - infrared studies of interaction - induced star formation have focused on interacting galaxy pairs in isolation from their environment .",
    "galaxies in the largest such study , the spitzer spirals , bridges and tails interacting galaxy survey ( ssb&t ; smith et  al .",
    "2007 ) , were optically selected from the arp catalog of interacting galaxies ( arp 1966 ) to include only nearby , isolated galaxy pairs that exhibited tidal features , and specifically excluded triple and higher multiple galaxy systems and merger remnants .",
    "smith et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) compared the mid - infrared properties of interacting galaxies in the ssb&t sample , as a whole , to those of normal , noninteracting spiral galaxies drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings ; kennicutt et  al .",
    "2003 ) . on average",
    ", they found that interacting galaxy pairs have redder mid - infrared colors , and that star formation is enhanced and more centrally concentrated in the dominant spiral galaxy of the interacting pair than in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "no evidence was found for a correlation between mid - infrared colors and galaxy pair separation in the interacting galaxies , as might have been expected from the optical data .",
    "also , no strong differences were found between the mid - infrared colors in the interacting galaxies stellar disks and those measured in their tidal bridges and tails .",
    "however , since the study averaged over interactions with different orbital characteristics and galaxy masses , subtle differences related to the details of the interaction could be washed out . individual case studies of a handful of isolated , interacting galaxy pairs , using ultraviolet , optical and mid - infrared data , suggested that interaction - induced star formation occurs in clumpy bursts .",
    "the ages and spatial distribution of the star - forming clumps may reflect the stage and orbital parameters of the collision , as inferred from numerical simulations of the collision ( e.g. wang et  al .",
