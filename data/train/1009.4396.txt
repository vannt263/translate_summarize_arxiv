    "ngc 4490/85 are a pair of closely interacting galaxies that are relatively nearby , at a distance of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "ngc 4490 is a type sb(s)d spiral galaxy , and its companion , ngc 4485 , is a type ib(s)m irregular galaxy @xcite .",
    "the optical isophotes of ngc 4490 indicate that its disk has a high inclination of @xmath11 @xcite , which allows us to separate emission from the hot gaseous medium in the plane and the halo of the galaxy .",
    "these galaxies are embedded in an unusually large envelope of hi gas @xcite , which @xcite suggest may have been formed by star formation driven outflows .",
    "@xcite studied the thermal and synchrotron components of the radio continuum emission from these galaxies and concluded that active star formation has been progressing throughout the disk of ngc 4490 at an approximately constant rate of @xmath12 for at least @xmath13 years .",
    "observations of the h@xmath9 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with star formation occuring throughout the disk of ngc 4490",
    ". however , h@xmath9 emission is also present between the galaxies , indicating that tidal interactions are important in determining the location of star formation .",
    "ngc 4490/85 were first imaged in x - rays by @xcite using _",
    "rosat_. they found 4 discrete sources in these galaxies as well as diffuse emission , but they were unable to isolate a hot ism , since the spectrum of the diffuse emission showed a high energy tail that suggested strong contamination by unresolved point sources . the first _",
    "observation , by @xcite , had an exposure time of 20 ks .",
    "they were able to resolve 29 discrete point sources in ngc 4490 and one in ngc 4485 , including 6 ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "they also detected diffuse emission that contributed @xmath14 of the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "they fitted an absorbed mekal model to the x - ray spectrum of the diffuse component , finding a temperature @xmath15 kev , an abundance @xmath16 and an absorbing hydrogen column density @xmath17 .",
    "two more _ chandra _ observations and an observation with _ xmm - newton _ have been used by @xcite to further investigate the ulx population in these galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we use all of the archival x - ray data from the _ chandra _ observatory @xcite to study in detail the properties of the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) gas in these galaxies . the sub - arcsecond resolution of the _ chandra _ mirror assembly @xcite enables us to remove emission from discrete sources ( x - ray binary systems or supernova remnants ) , and also allows us to separate the remaining diffuse emission from the hot gas in different regions within the galaxies . we extract the x - ray spectra from these regions and use spectral models to probe the properties of the hot gas .",
    "we also use these x - ray spectra to study the chemical enrichment of the hot ism by determining the abundances of various elements in different regions within the galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for studies following a similar approach ) .",
    "this paper is divided into the following sections .",
    "after the introduction (  1 ) , in  2 we describe the details of the _ chandra _ observations and the data reduction .",
    "we analyse the diffuse x - ray morphology in  3 , and then we conduct a spectral analysis of the different regions of the hot ism in ngc 4490 in  4 . the results of this spectral analysis are used to derive the physical properties of the hot gas in  5 . in ",
    "6 we discuss the morphology of the hot ism and compare this with the morphology of the cooler phases of the ism seen in other wavelengths , we discuss the nature of the hot gaseous ism and we consider the energy input and chemical enrichment of this medium from supernovae .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and present our conclusions in  7 .",
    "ngc 4490/85 have been observed three times with the acis - s detector on _ chandra _ , for a total exposure time of @xmath0 ks .",
    "the details of these observations are summarized in table  [ obs ] .",
    "we reprocessed the level 1 event files from these observations using the latest versions of the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations software ( ciao 4.1 ) and calibration database ( caldb 4.1 ) , and filtered them using the good time interval files to obtain new level 2 event files .",
    "more recent calibration files have been released since we started this analysis ( caldb 4.2 ) , however we found that the improvements in the calibration were small compared to the uncertainties in the data , resulting in the same spectral results , so we did not redo the analysis with caldb 4.2 . to identify any background flares , we created a lightcurve of the background emission in each observation , excluding any point sources detected by the ciao task _ wavdetect _ , and used the sigma - clipping algorithm _",
    "lc_sigma_clip _ in ciao to identify any time intervals when the lightcurve rose to more than @xmath18 above the mean value .",
    "we only found background flares in obsid 4726 , with a total duration of 1.2 ks .",
    "these intervals were excluded from the event file .",
    "we used the ciao software to reproject the world coordinate system ( wcs ) coordinates of the event files to match the obsid 4726 observation and corrected the aspect solutions for small shifts in the coordinates between observations ( determined from the position of a bright source found in all three observations ) .",
    "we then merged these reprojected event files using the ciao task _ dmmerge _ and extracted an image 700 x 700 pixels ( 5.74 arcmin across ) centered on the galaxies in the @xmath19 kev energy band . this image",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ galaxies1 ] .",
    "to look at the morphology of the diffuse x - ray emission from the hot gaseous ism we need to remove the discrete point sources .",
    "following @xcite , we split the x - ray image of the galaxies into three energy bands : @xmath20 kev , @xmath21 kev and @xmath22 kev , and then ran the ciao task _ wavdetect _ on these three images and the image of the entire energy band , @xmath19 kev . using wavelet scales of 2 and 4 pixels",
    ", we find a total of 55 sources at a threshold of 3@xmath23 . to confirm that these are genuine point sources , and",
    "not extended sources , we compared the radial extent of each source with the radius of the _ chandra _ acis point spread function ( psf ) at the same off - axis angle as the source , using an enclosed count fraction of 85% , which we obtained from the psf library on the hrma calibration page . as the off - axis angles of each source are different in the three observations it was necessary to measure the sources in the individual observations and not the merged image .",
    "four sources appeared to have a larger radius than the psf , however they were all extended at a significance level of below 2@xmath23 , so we can not confidently determine whether these sources are true point sources or extended objects .",
    "we therefore decided to exclude these four sources along with the 51 ` true ' point sources in our analysis of the hot ism .",
    "all 55 detected sources are listed in appendix  [ point_sources ] , where the four uncertain sources are also highlighted .    to create images of the diffuse emission ( but not for the spectral analysis )",
    ", these detected point sources were subtracted from the merged images in each of the separate energy bands , and the ciao task _ dmfilth _ was used to fill in each source region using values randomly sampled from an elliptical annular region around the source , using the source region as the inner boundary and an ellipse with twice the radius as the outer boundary of the elliptical annulus .",
    "the remaining emission includes the diffuse emission from the hot gaseous ism , although it is very likely that there is also contamination from unresolved point sources that could not be detected with the current _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the contours of the diffuse emission in these three energy bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ optical_xray ] .",
    "the point source - subtracted and filled images in each energy band were adaptively smoothed using the _ csmooth _ task in ciao , which uses a gaussian kernel that varies in size to obtain a minimum signal / noise ratio beneath the kernel at each pixel .",
    "we used a minimum s / n ratio of 2.4 , with the maximum s / n ratio set at 5 to prevent oversmoothing on larger scales ; and kernel sizes between 1 and 40 pixels .",
    "the medium energy band image was used to determine the smoothing scales , as it contained the largest number of counts , and then the same smoothing scales were applied to the other bands .",
    "we created exposure maps in each energy band , which were smoothed using the same smoothing scales , and then each image was divided by its corresponding smoothed exposure map .",
    "finally , we combined these smoothed , exposure - corrected images from the three energy bands to create a mapped - color image of the diffuse x - ray emission , which is shown in fig .  [ smoothed ] .",
    "we also created a smoothed image of all x - ray emission , including the point sources , using the same method , which is also shown in fig .",
    "[ smoothed ] for comparison .",
    "these images show a soft ( red ) extended halo and four regions of extended bright emission in ngc 4490 . the comparison of soft diffuse x - ray and r - band optical emission in fig .",
    "[ optical_xray ] shows that two of these regions of extended bright emission emanate from the nucleus of ngc 4490 , while the other two emanate from the base of the spiral arm that extends towards the companion galaxy , ngc 4485 .",
    "these regions are reminiscent of the outflows found in starburst nuclei ( e.g. ngc 253 @xcite ; m82 @xcite ) .",
    "the disk of ngc 4490 appears blue in this image , suggesting considerable absorption by the cold ism .",
    "we divided the halo of ngc 4490 into six azimuthal sectors - four containing the outflows and two containing the regions of the halo between the outflows .",
    "these sectors are shown in fig .",
    "[ sectors ] .",
    "we found that the thermal component of the x - ray emission dominates in the energy band @xmath24 kev , whereas above 2.0 kev the x - ray emission is dominated by the power - law component from unresolved point sources ( see  6.2 ) .",
    "therefore , to investigate the radial profiles of the hot gas in the halo and outflows we used x - ray emission in the @xmath24 kev band . to enable us to study the spectral hardness ratios ( which we describe in  3.3.2 ) as well as the total x - ray surface brightness profiles in this band , the x - ray image was divided into two energy ranges , a soft band at @xmath25 kev and a hard band at @xmath26 kev .",
    "we divided each sector into circular annuli 10 pixels wide centered between the bases of the two pairs of outflows in ngc 4490 , and then used the ciao task _ dmextract _ to extract the number of counts in each radial bin of each sector in the two energy bands , starting from the radius at which the plane region ends and the halo begins in each sector .",
    "the north east corner of the image was not covered by the acis - s3 chip in all three _ chandra _ observations , so the radial profiles are strongly affected by exposure in this region . to correct for this effect ,",
    "we created exposure maps in the two energy bands and created radial profiles of them in each sector . in the three sectors on the south side of the galaxy the profiles of the exposure maps remain approximately constant , however on the north side they decrease significantly above a radius of 100 arcsec . for each radial bin above 100 arcsec in these northern sectors we calculated the ratio between the exposure map in that bin and the mean value within 100 arcsec , and then used these ratios to weight the corresponding radial bins in the x - ray surface brightness profiles , thereby correcting these profiles for exposure .    these brightness profiles reach a constant background level at a radius of 140 arcsec ( see fig .",
    "[ sb_profile_with_bkg ] ) , which corresponds to a distance of 5.3 kpc at the distance to ngc 4490 of 7.8 mpc .",
    "therefore for the background region we used a segment of a circular annulus between radii of 140 arcsec to 220 arcsec , in the three southern sectors .",
    "we did not include the northern sectors in the background region because they were affected by exposure , and we did not include the regions between the northern and southern sectors because the brightness profiles will extend further out radially along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "we were limited by the area of the merged acis - s3 image covered by all three observations , however the uncertainties in the net counts in each radial bin were dominated by uncertainties in the total measured counts and not the background , so using a larger background region would have little effect on our results .",
    "most of the radial bins in each sector contained a small number of counts , so for bins in which there were fewer than 50 counts we obtained the uncertainties using the tables in @xcite , who uses poisson and binomial statistics to calculate the confidence limits of small numbers for which the standard approximation of @xmath27 is not valid .      the exposure - corrected , background - subtracted profiles in the energy bands @xmath25 kev and @xmath26 kev were combined to create the radial x - ray surface brightness profiles of each azimuthal sector in the energy band @xmath24 kev .",
    "we then used ciao s modeling and fitting software package , _ sherpa _ , to fit power - law , exponential and gaussian models to these profiles , from the radius at which the halo region begins in each sector out to a radius of 140 arcsec , where the background region begins .",
    "these profiles are shown with their best fit power - law , exponential and gaussian models in fig .",
    "[ brightness_profiles ] , and the best fit parameters are summarized in table  [ profile_pars ] .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness profiles in the halo are well fit by all three models , with @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the reduced @xmath30 for @xmath31 degrees of freedom ) , however in the outflows the power - law model is a poorer fit than the exponential or gaussian models .",
    "the exponential model gives a fairly good fit in the nw and sw outflows , with @xmath32 , however in the ne and se outflows neither model gives a good fit , both giving @xmath33 .",
    "the exposure - corrected , background - subtracted profiles in the energy bands @xmath25 kev and @xmath26 kev were also used to calculate the radial profiles of the spectral hardness ratio , which is defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the number of counts in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 energy bands respectively .",
    "the uncertainties in q were relatively large , so we increased the size of the radial bins to 20 pixels per bin up to a radius of 100 arcsec , and we combined all bins from 100 arcsec to 140 arcsec into a single bin .",
    "these profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ hardness_ratios ] .",
    "they suggest that in general the temperatures are declining less steeply than would be expected for an adiabatically expanding gas ( see  6.2 ) .",
    "we extracted the spectrum of the diffuse emission of ngc 4490 from an elliptical region with a semi - major axis of 130 arcsec ( corresponding to 4.9 kpc at a distance of 7.8 mpc ) centered on ngc 4490 and excluding the point source regions .",
    "we used the ciao script _",
    "specextract _ to extract the x - ray spectra from each _ chandra _ observation along with the response matrix files ( rmfs ) and the ancillary response files ( arfs ) .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from a region to the south west of ngc 4490 with a total area of @xmath39 .",
    "these source and background regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ 4490_spec_regions ] .",
    "the spectra from the separate observations were added using the ftool _ mathpha _ , and the response files from each observation were weighted by the exposure times and added using the ftools _ addrmf _ and _ addarf_. the spectra were then grouped to contain a minimum of 20 counts per bin , using the ` adaptive ' option in the ciao tool _",
    "dmgroup _ , which leaves bright regions ungrouped and groups low signal to noise regions of the spectrum until they contain the minimum number of counts .",
    "the effective area of the acis detector on _ chandra _ is known to degrade over time , particularly at softer energies , which could create significant differences between data taken from observations separated by several years .",
    "we use observations from 2000 and 2004 , so to investigate whether this effect is significant we also considered fitting the spectra from the 2000 and 2004 observations separately .",
    "we found that this had no significant impact on our results as the response files accurately account for the degradation in the effective area of the acis detector , so we continue to use the combined spectra in the following analysis .    to identify any emission lines in the spectrum of the diffuse emission of ngc 4490 we used _ sherpa _ to fit the continuum emission with an absorbed bremsstrahlung model plus a power - law component to account for unresolved point sources that may still contaminate the diffuse emission . after an initial fit in the energy range @xmath19 kev this spectrum showed clear evidence for excesses above the continuum fit , attributable to emission lines , including the ( fe+o+ne ) blend in the energy band @xmath40 kev , mg at @xmath41 kev and si at @xmath42 kev . to fit this model to only the continuum emission",
    "this fit was repeated excluding these energy bands that include strong line emission .",
    "these lines are highlighted in the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ spectrum_all ] .    following the method used by @xcite and @xcite , we extracted x - ray images in these energy bands containing strong line emission and also continuum images in the energy bands @xmath43 kev and @xmath44 kev .",
    "we used the best fit continuum model to weight the continuum images to the emission line energy bands and subtracted them to create images of the line emission from ( fe+o+ne ) , mg and si . these images were then combined to create a mapped - color emission line strength map of these galaxies , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ line_map ] .",
    "note that the relative lack of ( fe+o+ne ) emission in the galaxy plane ( which appears blue in fig .",
    "[ line_map ] ) may be in fact due to the higher @xmath45 in this region .",
    "this is taken fully into account in our spectral fitting , where we separate different regions .      using the diffuse x - ray image and the emission line strength map",
    ", we divided the diffuse x - ray emission from ngc 4490 into two regions , the halo and the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we also divided these regions into two further subregions each that appear to show different spectral properties in these images - the halo was split into a combined subregion containing all outflows , and the rest of the halo ; and the plane was split into the central and outer plane subregions .",
    "these regions and subregions are highlighted in fig .",
    "[ regions ] . there were too few counts from the companion galaxy , ngc 4485 , to be able to fit a model to its x - ray spectrum . in each region and",
    "subregion we extracted the x - ray spectra and their response files using the same method described in  4.1 . since the line strength map in fig .",
    "[ line_map ] suggests that the individual outflows show different spectral lines , in particular in the ne outflow , we also extracted x - ray spectra from each individual outflow separately and compared them .",
    "the individual outflows contained too few counts to distinguish these different line structures in their separate spectra , so we will use their comined spectrum in the following analysis .    to model the spectrum of the hot ism we used the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) @xcite , which is based on the thermal plasma emission model introduced by @xcite but makes use of modern computing techniques and more accurate atomic data .",
    "the spectrum may also be contaminated by unresolved point sources such as x - ray binaries , which , in the hard / low state , typically have power - law spectra with a photon index @xmath46 in the range @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we therefore added a power - law component with a fixed photon index of @xmath48 to account for these unresolved point sources .",
    "@xcite found similar contamination from unresolved point sources in several regions of the hot ism in ngc 4038/9 ( ` the antennae ' ) , which they were able to characterize with a power - law . in many of these regions",
    "they fixed the photon index at a value of @xmath49 , although they also considered allowing it to vary freely . to confirm that the value of @xmath48 that we used is consistent with our spectra we extracted the x - ray spectrum of all emission from ngc 4490 ( including point sources ) in the energy range @xmath50 kev and fitted a power - law using _",
    "sherpa_. this fit gave a photon index @xmath51 , which is close to the value that we used .",
    "we found that using this value instead of @xmath52 did not make a significant difference to the spectral results , so it was not necessary to redo the analysis using this value .",
    "the thermal and power - law components were both multiplied by a photoelectric absorption model ( _ xswabs _ in _ sherpa _ ) to account for both galactic and intrinsic absorption .",
    "we then used _ sherpa _ to fit this absorbed apec plus power - law model to the spectra from each region and subregion , using the _ neldermead _ optimization method in _ sherpa _ ( a simplex algorithm created by @xcite ) .",
    "the apec component dominates the spectrum at softer energies , while the power - law dominates at harder energies , so we initially fitted just the power - law component in the energy range @xmath53 kev , where the thermal component is negligible - at energies above @xmath54 kev the background dominates .",
    "the power - law parameters were then fixed at their best fit values in this energy range and the remaining components were fit in the energy range @xmath55 kev - at energies below @xmath56 kev the _",
    "data is poorly calibrated .",
    "the abundances of fe , ne , mg and si in the apec model were allowed to vary , as they show strong emission lines .",
    "we also considered varying the abundance of o , which showed strong line emission as well , however we found that this abundance was poorly constrained .",
    "therefore the abundances of o and all other elements were fixed at their solar values ( as measured by @xcite ) .    at energies above 2.0 kev",
    "the spectra have a poor s / n ratio .",
    "we considered increasing the binning of the spectra , with up to a minimum of 50 counts per bin , however we found that this made little difference to the fits , with the parameters changing by no more than 10% .",
    "we therefore continue to use spectra binned with a minimum of 20 counts per bin , which prevents the bin sizes becoming too large around the emission lines , which generally have good s / n ratios .",
    "the spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , and their best fit parameters are summarized in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the @xmath57 uncertainties in the parameters were calculated using the _ projection ( ) _ command in _ sherpa _ , which varies each parameter and calculates the change in the @xmath30 value . to confirm the accuracy of these uncertainties , and also to look at whether any of the parameters were correlated , we looked at the confidence level contours in the planes of both @xmath58 and @xmath45 plotted against each other and each of the abundances , and also the planes of the fe abundance against each of the other abundances . in the plane region and subregions these contours",
    "were well behaved , showing a single minimum in the @xmath30 at the best fit values , however in the halo regions and subregions the contours often showed two or three minima .",
    "the 1 , 2 and 3@xmath23 confidence level contours in the plane and halo regions are shown for the @xmath58 vs @xmath45 plane in fig .",
    "[ nh_kt_contours ] ; they show that the gas in the halo region does have a lower temperature than in the plane region , but the hydrogen column density in the halo is uncertain due to the presence of two local minima either side of the best fit value .",
    "therefore , while the best fit parameters do find the global @xmath30 minimum , the presence of other local minima may make the uncertainties larger than those found by the _ projection ( ) _ command in _ sherpa _ in the halo regions and subregions .",
    "these fits suggest that the temperature of the gas is higher in the plane of ngc 4490 , which could explain the harder color in the plane that is seen in fig .",
    "[ smoothed ] .",
    "we can not compare @xmath45 in the plane and halo from the spectral fitting alone because it is poorly constrained in the halo , however maps of the 21 cm line emission suggest that @xmath45 is higher in the plane ( see fig .",
    "[ h1 ] in  6.1 ) .",
    "if this is true then this could also contribute to the harder color seen in the plane .",
    "the spectral fits suggest that the metal abundances are higher in the halo , particularly in the outflows , however the large uncertainties in these parameters prevent us from making a conclusive comparison between the abundances in the halo and the plane .",
    "the emission line strength map also suggests that there are higher abundances of fe and ne in the outflows , however if the absorption is higher in the plane , as suggested by the 21 cm line map ( fig .",
    "[ h1 ] ) , then the fe and ne emission may simply be absorbed in the plane .",
    "therefore we can not conclusively compare the plane and halo based on the emission line strength map either .",
    "using the abundances found from the spectral fits in each region and subregion , we calculated the ratios of the ne , mg and si abundances with respect to the fe abundance .",
    "these ratios are summarized in table  [ abundance_ratios ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the abundances obtained from the spectral fits are asymmetric ( see table  [ parameters ] ) , so we can not use the standard rules for error propagation , which assume that the errors are gaussian . therefore , to calculate the uncertainties in the abundance ratios we introduced a new parameter into the _ sherpa _ model which we linked with the model parameters so that this new parameter was equal to each of the abundance ratios in turn .",
    "we were then able to calculate the uncertainties in _ sherpa _ using the _ projection ( ) _ command .",
    "this method correctly accounts for the asymmetric errors , since they are calculated directly from the changes in @xmath30 , and it also accounts for correlations between model parameters , which the error propagation rules can not as they assume that the parameters are independent .",
    "the errors calculated by this method are significantly smaller than if they had been calculated using the standard error propagation rules , which suggests that the abundances are correlated .",
    "to investigate this effect further , we ran a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation to simulate the distribution of the abundance ratios in our spectral fits .",
    "in the plane and central plane regions the results of this simulation agreed with the smaller uncertainties found by _ sherpa _ , and",
    "the confidence level contours in these regions confirm that the abundances are strongly correlated , as they are narrow ellipses in which the individual abundances vary over a large range , while their ratios only vary a little . these confidence level contours from the plane region of ngc 4490",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ abun_contours ] .",
    "however , in the other regions the mcmc simulation was strongly affected by the unusual shape of the confidence level contours in these regions , for example getting stuck in local minima , which resulted in confidence intervals that were either strongly asymmetric or did not enclose the best fit values .",
    "we have characterized the thermal x - ray emission from the hot gaseous ism using the apec model , which assumes that the plasma is in a collisional ionization equilibrium . however , the relatively high abundance ratios that we find in the hot ism suggest that this plasma may originate from young supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from this plasma would then be dominated by shocked supernova ejecta for which this assumption of ionization equilibrium may not be true .",
    "therefore we also fitted the spectra of the diffuse x - ray emission from ngc 4490 with an absorbed non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model ( _ xsvnei _ in _ sherpa _ ) plus a power - law component .",
    "this model was fitted using the same method described in  4.2 for the absorbed apec plus power - law model .",
    "the best fit parameters of this model are summarized in table  [ nei_pars ] and the spectra are plotted with this model in fig .",

    "the abundance ratios from this model were calculated as described in  4.2.2 and are summarized in table  [ nei_abund ] .    the spectral fits using the nei model",
    "give very similar values for the reduced @xmath30 as the fits using the apec model , however the ionization timescale parameter @xmath59 in the nei fits is typically @xmath60 .",
    "if the plasma was close to a collisional ionization equilibrium then we would expect @xmath61 @xcite , so this suggests that the plasma is in a nonequilibrium ionization state .",
    "we will therefore use the results of the nei fits for the rest of the analysis .    the spectral fits using the apec model",
    "suggested that the gas was hotter in the plane of ngc 4490 than in the halo ( see  4.2.1 ) , however the parameters of the nei model were poorly constrained , and the temperature in the plane region is only a lower limit , so we can not make a conclusive comparison between the temperatures of the gas in the plane and the halo .",
    "the metal abundances in the nei fits are higher in the halo than in the plane , similar to the results using the apec model , however the uncertainties from the nei fits are even larger , so we still can not conclusively compare the metal abundances in the plane and halo .",
    "we also note that the abundance ratios derived from the nei model are generally consistent with those derived from the apec model .",
    "using the results from the spectral analysis we can derive properties of the hot ism gas in each region and subregion .",
    "we use the results of the spectral fits with the nei model in this section as the nei fits suggested that the plasma is not in a collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "the normalization of the nei model is proportional to the emission measure , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the number density and @xmath64 is the volume . to calculate the electron number density @xmath65 we need to make assumptions about the volume of the emitting region . for the volume of the plane",
    "we assume that we are viewing the disk of the galaxy edge on , so that the emitting region is a circular disk with thickness equal to the width of the region that we see , and a diameter equal to the length of this region .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) in the spiral galaxy ngc 4490 , which is interacting with the irregular galaxy ngc 4485 , using @xmath0ks of _ chandra _ acis - s observations . </S>",
    "<S> the high angular resolution of _ chandra _ enables us to remove discrete sources and perform spatially resolved spectroscopy for the star forming regions and associated outflows , allowing us to look at how the physical properties of the hot ism such as temperature , hydrogen column density and metal abundances vary throughout these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find temperatures of @xmath1 kev and @xmath2 kev , electron densities of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and hot gas masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the plane and halo of ngc 4490 respectively , where @xmath7 is the filling factor of the hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance ratios of ne , mg and si with respect to fe are found to be consistent with those predicted by theoretical models of type ii supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal energy in the hot ism is @xmath8 of the total mechanical energy input from supernovae , so it is likely that the hot ism has been enriched and heated by type ii supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission is anticorrelated with the h@xmath9 and mid - infrared emission , suggesting that the hot gas is bounded by filaments of cooler ionized hydrogen mixed with warm dust . </S>"
