    "there has been a growing interest in the properties of charmed hadrons after belle , babar , cdf and other collaborations observed a series of interesting new states @xcite .",
    "much attention is paid to the recently observed charmed hadrons @xcite .",
    "one may also wonder whether there exist some undiscovered new states .",
    "certainly , the interaction of charmed hadrons is important to understand the underlying structure of these states .",
    "the light pseudoscalar meson and charmed baryon scattering can reflect the interaction between them .",
    "we will use the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath3pt ) to study the scattering lengths between the light pseudoscalar meson and charmed baryon in the triplet , sextet , and excited sextet to the third order .",
    "the scattering lengths are expanded as a power series in @xmath4 with explicit power counting , where @xmath4 is the small momentum of the light pseudoscalar mesons or the residual momentum of the charmed baryons .",
    "the mass difference between charmed baryons is also counted as @xmath5 .",
    "the scattering length @xmath6 is related to the @xmath7-matrix @xmath8 at the threshold by @xmath9 . on the one hand",
    ", the positive scattering length indicates that there exists attractive interaction in these channels , which might lead to the loosely bound molecular states . on the other hand",
