    "this paper is a follow - up to our previous paper  @xcite , where we presented an algebraic construction of the chiral effective action for conformal field theory on higher genus riemann surfaces .",
    "the aim of the present work is two - fold .",
    "first , in light of the renewed interest for classical field theory  @xcite , we present a case study for an action functional whose construction exhibits non - trivial algebraic properties  the action is actually the evaluation of a certain deligne class .",
    "the functional is non - topological , which should be contrasted with cases where methods of homological algebra and algebraic topology were used to construct topological terms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the recent development of string theory , there appear dynamical fields of a new geometric content , such as , for example , the @xmath0-field .",
    "it is very important to find adequate geometric structures to describe these fields and to devise suitable action functionals  @xcite .",
    "some attempts have been made at introducing the language of _ gerbes _ as the proper geometric structure , at least in the lower degrees ( where the language itself makes sense ) . in this approach",
    ", one usually settles for a ech description relative to some open covering of the underlying manifold . therefore an added motivation to our work , although we mention gerbes only in passing , was to show the universal nature of the ech paradigm for constructing action functionals . by this",
    "we mean to develop a method which works for general ech resolutions and cohomology with respect to _ arbitrary coverings _ , and not just the standard open cover , and which allows to freely change among the coverings .",
    "this brings us to the second goal : to describe explicitly the dependence of the chiral action functional on various default choices , which is necessary in order to make our construction in  @xcite work for arbitrary coverings .",
    "in particular , this calls for the following .    1 .   a detailed analysis of the descent equations with respect to the nerve of the cover , where the use of deligne complexes becomes crucial . 2 .",
    "an analysis of the dependence of the chiral action on the choice of the projective structure on the riemann surface .",
    "recall that the choice of the universal cover for a riemann surface , made in  @xcite , yields a default choice for the projective structure : the fuchsian projective structure , provided by the uniformization map .",
    "since the universal conformal ward identity ( cwi ) determines the chiral action only up to a holomorphic projective connection , the dependence of the chiral action functional on the choice of a projective structure should be compatible with it .",
    "indeed , we prove this for the chiral action `` on shell '' , i.e. , for solutions of the classical equations of motion .",
    "in order to describe the content of this paper in more detail , we briefly recall the main results in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a beltrami coefficient on @xmath2  a smooth bounded function @xmath1 with the property @xmath3  and let @xmath4 be a solution of the beltrami equation @xmath5 a self - map @xmath6 , unique up to post - composition with a mbius transformation .",

    "consider the universal cover @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the upper half - plane , and let @xmath1 be a beltrami coefficient on @xmath16 , which is a pull - back of a beltrami coefficient on @xmath13 ( see  [ sec : prel_qc ] and  @xcite , and also  @xcite for details )",
    ". depending on the extension of @xmath1 into the lower half - plane , there exists a unique solution @xmath4 to the beltrami equation on @xmath16 .",
    "it is a map @xmath17 with the following intertwining property : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a fuchsian group uniformizing the riemann surface @xmath13 ( it is isomorphic to @xmath20 as an abstract group ) , and @xmath21 is an isomorphism onto a discrete subgroup of @xmath22 . the domain @xmath23 is diffeomorphic to @xmath16 and can be made equal to @xmath16 by choosing an appropriate extension of @xmath1 . in this way one gets a deformation map @xmath24 ( which is also denoted by @xmath4 ) onto a new riemann surface @xmath25 .",
    "the de rham complex on @xmath16 is a complex of @xmath19-modules for the obvious pull - back action .",
    "the basic 2-form of polyakov s ansatz @xmath26=\\frac{f_{zz}}{f_z}\\mu_z \\,dz\\wedge d\\bar z\\ ] ] on @xmath16 is manifestly not invariant under the action of @xmath19 ; this means that regarding @xmath27 $ ] as a 0-cochain for @xmath19 with values in 2-forms , its group coboundary is not zero .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath27 $ ] can be extended to a cocycle @xmath28 $ ] of total degree 2 living in the double complex @xmath29 , whose total cohomology coincides with the de rham cohomology of @xmath13 .",
    "simple integration for the genus zero case is replaced by the evaluation over a suitable representative @xmath30 of the fundamental class @xmath31 $ ] of @xmath13 , defining @xmath32 = \\langle \\omega[f],\\sigma\\rangle.\\ ] ] this construction  @xcite extends the definition of the chiral action to a higher genus riemann surface @xmath13 , and the functional @xmath33 $ ] has the same variational properties as polyakov s action on the complex plane . in particular , it solves the universal cwi , the general solution being the sum of @xmath9=-c/96\\pi^2\\,s[f]$ ] and an arbitrary quadratic differential , holomorphic with respect to the new complex structure on @xmath13 determined by the beltrami differential @xmath1 .",

    "these projective structures are inherent in the choice of @xmath16 as a cover , and they do not appear explicitly in the expression for the total cocycle @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "* @xmath38 has to be invoked to close the descent equations leading from @xmath39 to the total cocycle @xmath40 .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as the vanishing of an obstruction or , in other words , as an integrability property for the problem of choosing integration constants to the last descent equation .",
    "an element of arbitrariness is introduced in the explicit computation of @xmath40 by choosing a shift of a @xmath2-valued 3-cochain in this equation to turn it into ech coboundary .",
    "* a specific choice of logarithm branches was made in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this construction shows that what we have used were not some specific features of the universal cover @xmath41 , but rather its algebraic properties relative to the double complex @xmath42 : the facts that @xmath16 is contractible , and that @xmath19 is cohomologically trivial with respect to modules of smooth forms on @xmath16 .",
    "these are precisely the properties of a `` good '' cover  @xcite , one for which the ech - de rham double complex computes cohomology groups for both theories .    as in  @xcite ,",
    "start with the deformation map @xmath43 , defined , say , as the solution of the beltrami equation on @xmath13 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether it is possible to carry out the same scheme as with @xmath16 with respect to a different cover of @xmath13 , for example an ordinary open cover @xmath44 of @xmath13 , with the requirement that it should allow for a change of covering morphism without changing the formalism .",
    "this is achieved by considering , for a given covering map @xmath45 and a sheaf @xmath46 , or complex of sheaves @xmath47 on @xmath13 , its ech cohomology @xmath48 , or hypercohomology @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the framework of the universal cover is retrieved from the observation that group cohomology for @xmath19 is ech cohomology for the covering @xmath15 .",
    "our main difference from  @xcite is the use of the deligne complex instead of the simpler de rham complex . in particular , introducing the smooth de rham sheaves @xmath50 , we work with the deligne complex of length 3 : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , and apply the same procedure as before .",
    "namely , we form the double complex @xmath53 , localize the polyakov s",
