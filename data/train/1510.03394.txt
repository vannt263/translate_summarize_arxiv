    "we start our appendices with the following discussion , which is a summary of the work done in deriving the device - independent guessing probability ( digp ) @xcite . a probability distribution that is the outcome distribution for some measurement on a quantum state",

    "for example , a distribution @xmath135 with elements @xmath136 is quantum if there exist at least one positive semi - definite hermitian unit trace matrix @xmath137 and at least one set of positive semi - definite hermitian matrices @xmath138 , @xmath139 satisfying @xmath140 and @xmath141 such that @xmath142 .",
    "we will often abuse notation and refer to a distribution by its elements @xmath136 when there is no confusion in doing so .",
    "the set @xmath143 of quantum distributions is closed and convex and a distribution in @xmath143 that can not be decomposed as a convex combination of other distributions is called _ extremal _ in @xmath143 . for a non - extremal distribution @xmath144",
    "there is in general more than one possible convex decomposition .",
    "a non - extremal distribution @xmath136 with a convex decomposition @xmath145 can be constructed by sampling the different distributions @xmath146 with probability @xmath147 . in this case knowledge about the convex decomposition chosen changes the ability of an eavesdropper to correctly guess the outcomes @xmath148 and/or @xmath149 .    without knowledge of the decomposition , or for extremal distributions ,",
    "the probability of correctly guessing the outcome of measurement @xmath150 is @xmath151 , the probability of the most likely outcome .",
    "with knowledge of the decomposition @xmath145 , the probability is larger or equal to @xmath151 @xmath152 for a given observed non - extremal distribution it is possible that it was produced by an agent eve that has larger predictive power than an agent which only observes the outcomes . the maximal probability for the agent eve to correctly guess an outcome @xmath149 of measurement @xmath150 given a distribution @xmath153 and a free choice of decomposition is the digp @xmath154 @xmath155 where @xmath156 is labelling the convex decompositions of @xmath157 in terms of extremal distributions @xmath146 . for any open interval of @xmath143",
    "the function @xmath154 is a concave function @xcite .",
    "therefore this kind of maximization is called a _",

    "the guessing probability as a function on the space of probability distributions is not everywhere continuous .",
    "an example of this is that the family of bell - inequalities described in of ref .",

    "[ eq : ibeta2 ] has @xmath158 and is at the same time arbitrarily close to a distribution corresponding to measurements on a product state with @xmath159 , i.e. , a distribution which can be prepared by a local deterministic procedure .",
    "there is thus a discontinuity where the guessing probability jumps from @xmath63 to @xmath160 .",
    "the key to understanding this discontinuity is that the local deterministic distribution is not extremal while the quantum distribution in the neighbouring point is extremal . as seen in eq .",
    "[ noos ] , the guessing probability is given by different functions depending on whether a distribution can be decomposed into other distributions or not , i.e. , if it is extremal or not .",
    "this means discontinuities can appear at the boundary between extremal points and non - extremal points .",
    "we will now show that discontinuities can _ only _ appear at such boundaries between extremal and non - extremal points in the boundary @xmath161 of the quantum set @xmath32 . to do this we use the property of the guessing probability described in eq .",
    "[ noos ] , together with some general properties of concave functions and in particular concave roof constructions .",
    "we want to show that the following propositions are true :    [ prop1 ] the function @xmath154 on the set of quantum distributions @xmath32 is continuous in the interior of @xmath32 .",
    "[ prop2 ] the function @xmath154 is continuous in any extremal point of @xmath32 .",
    "proposition [ prop1 ] is trivial .",
    "the guessing probability @xmath154 is concave by definition and any concave function is continuous on an open subset of its domain @xcite .",
    "in particular this means that @xmath154 is continuous in the interior of @xmath32 .",
    "to address proposition [ prop2 ] we consider the restriction @xmath162 of @xmath154 to the boundary @xmath161 of the quantum set .",
    "first we note that the function @xmath163 by definition is continuous on any open set of extremal points since @xmath164 is a continuous function .",
    "next we observe that the boundary @xmath165 can be decomposed into a collection of open sets of extremal points and a collection @xmath166 of closed connected possibly overlapping sets where each set is the closure of a maximal open connected subset .",
    "a maximal open connected subset @xmath167 of the non - extremal points is an open set such that any other open connected set of non - extremal points which contains @xmath167 is @xmath167 itself .",
    "therefore , each set @xmath168 is the convex hull of the set of extremal points in its closure .",
    "any closed set @xmath168 has a boundary @xmath169 with the rest of @xmath165 which can be decomposed in the same way into open sets of extremal points and closed connected sets @xmath170 that are closures of maximal open connected sets of non - extremal points .",
    "the boundary @xmath171 of @xmath170 with the rest of @xmath169 is in turn decomposable in the same way .",

    "@xcite .",
    "a function for which all discontinuities are such that the function takes the higher value at a closed set and the lower value at an open set is called _ upper semi - continuous_.    the function @xmath174 defined on a closed convex set @xmath175 can be viewed as an extension of @xmath176 to the interior of @xmath175 . this extension is called the _ concave roof extension_.

    "the guessing probability is bounded and concave by definition . if the boundary of @xmath175 has only extremal points it follows that @xmath176 is continuous in @xmath180 and by theorem [ theo1 ] @xmath174 is upper semi - continuous on @xmath175 . moreover , since @xmath174 is concave it can not have an upper semi - continuous discontinuity between the boundary and the interior .",
    "if @xmath175 is a one - dimensional simplex we can , if necessary , restrict the domain of the guessing probability to a one dimensional subspace and make the same argument .",
    "next we consider discontinuities between @xmath175 and an open set of extremal points .",
    "[ theo2]any discontinuity of @xmath154 between a closed set and an open set of extremal points is upper semi - continuous .",
    "if the boundary point of the closed set is extremal the @xmath154 is continuous since @xmath151 is continuous .",
    "next consider a non - extremal boundary point of the closed set .",
    "@xmath154 in the non - extremal point is always greater or equal to @xmath181 by eq .",
    "thus any discontinuity is upper semi - continuous .    if there is a discontinuity of @xmath154 on the boundary of @xmath175 it is , by lemma [ theo2 ] , upper semi - continuous and at a set of non - extremal points .    by repeated application of theorem [ theo1 ] and lemma [ theo2 ]",
    "we can conclude that @xmath163 is upper semi - continuous on @xmath165 and that @xmath154 is upper semi - continuous on @xmath182 . since @xmath154 is concave there can not be an upper semi - continuous discontinuity between the boundary @xmath165 and the interior of @xmath183 .",
    "thus the only discontinuities are between non - extremal points in closed subsets of @xmath165 and extremal points in open subsets of @xmath165 .",
    "we have described the guessing probability as a function on set of quantum distributions , but it is sometimes useful to consider it as a function of the violation of some given bell inequality @xmath184 .",
    "a bell expression is a linear function on the space of distributions and the set of distributions for which it takes a given value @xmath185 is a hyper - plane @xmath186 .",
    "the different values of the bell expression thus defines a family of parallel hyperplanes .    on each hyperplane",
    "@xmath186 we can consider the restriction @xmath187 of @xmath154 to the intersection of @xmath186 with @xmath183 and take its maximum @xmath188 on this intersection .",
    "this maximum is the highest probability for eve to guess the outcome of @xmath150 for any distribution @xmath189 such that @xmath190 .",

    "let us consider a bell expression @xmath184 and its maximal value @xmath194 on @xmath143 . if the intersection of @xmath195 and @xmath143 is a single extremal point it follows from propositions [ prop1 ] and [ prop2 ] that there is a @xmath196 such that for the range @xmath197 for which @xmath188 is a continuous function of @xmath185 .",
    "if the intersection of @xmath195 and @xmath143 contains more than one extremal point it also contains a set of non - extremal points of @xmath198 and @xmath154 could have a discontinuity between this set and an open set of extremal points .",
    "this discontinuity could lead to a discontinuity of the function @xmath188 at @xmath194 .",
    "let us consider a sequence of measurements @xmath199 chosen by bob and denote @xmath200 .",
    "the convex decomposition of the observed outcome distribution that gives eve optimal probability to correctly guess the sequence of outcomes @xmath201 of the measurements @xmath202 is a function of @xmath203 .",
    "the guessing probability @xmath204 is thus given by @xmath205 where the extremal distributions @xmath206 and weights @xmath207 of the optimal convex decomposition are functions of @xmath203 as indicated by the index @xmath208 .",
    "let us assume that a term which appears in the convex combination is @xmath209 thus we assume that it corresponds to the most probable sequence of outcomes @xmath210 for a specific distribution indexed by @xmath208 .",
    "given that eve has chosen the optimal convex decomposition for guessing the outcomes of @xmath211 we consider her probability of correctly guessing the outcome of @xmath212 for @xmath213 given a particular sequence of previous outcomes @xmath214 .",

    "our bound is thus tight at the maximal violation of the inequality .",
    "since the probability distribution of maximal violation is unique , the point is necessarily an extreme point @xcite , so we can directly use the observed guessing probability @xmath253 to bound the eavesdropper s predictive power ( as an extreme point allows only for one decomposition : itself ) .",
    "+   + if we now want to use our function to bound the guessing probability _ inside _ the set ( not only at the point of maximal violation ) , and following the arguments of @xcite , one can check that the function @xmath259 bounding the @xmath260 is a concave function of its variable @xmath66 : @xmath261 + where we used that both the numerator and denominator are positive from @xmath262 .",

    "<S> it was shown how to use non - locality ( probability distributions that violate a bell inequality ) to _ certify _ the unpredictability of the outcomes of certain physical processes . </S>",

    "<S> entanglement is a necessary resource for quantum non - locality , that in turn is required for randomness certification . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus crucial to understand qualitatively and quantitatively how these three fundamental quantities relate one to another . in our work , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite shows that either of the two parties , alice or bob can certify at most @xmath3 bits of randomness @xcite , where @xmath4 is the dimension of the local hilbert space the state lives in , which in turn implies a bound of @xmath5 bits when the two outputs are combined . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates a fundamental limitation for device - independent randomness certification in this standard scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of our work is to show that this limitation on the amount of certifiable random bits from one quantum state can be lifted . to do this </S>",

    "<S> basis @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of this measurement is random and if the device then makes another measurement on the state , this time in the pauli-@xmath6 basis , it gives yet another random outcome . in this fashion of alternating between the two orthogonal bases , one can potentially obtain an unbounded number of random bits from one qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the limitation of this procedure for producing random numbers is that one can not distinguish this device from a classical one with pre - programmed outcomes  a _ local model _ for the outcomes  if one does not trust the functioning of the device completely .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly we can not _ certify _ any randomness from a single system ( in a device - independent manner ) as in the above example , since one needs non - locality for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> but is it possible to build a scheme , that exploits non - locality and makes use of this idea of measuring the state repeatedly , to overcome the bound on the amount of certifiable randomness that one can obtain from a single entangled quantum system ? </S>",
    "<S> to do so , the main obstacle comes from the fact that the local measurements needed to generate the random outcomes destroy the entanglement present in the state ( and non - locality in the correlations ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one of the challenges is to come up with non - destructive measurements that still produce non - locality but retain some entanglement in the post - measurement state . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the state can still be used as a resource for subsequent measurements . </S>",
    "<S> bell tests with sequences of measurements have received less attention than the standard ones with single measurement in the literature despite the novel features in this scenario @xcite . in our work we show that they prove useful in the task of randomness certification , which also provides another example  @xcite where general measurements can overcome limitations of projective ones .    </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we describe a scheme where any number @xmath12 of random bits can be certified using a sequence of @xmath13 consecutive measurements on the same system . </S>",

    "<S> [ app1:pggen ] , [ app2:continuityproof ] , and [ app6:contatpextunique ] we show how to make conclusions about the guessing probability for non - maximal violations . in particular , we show that for _ any _ bell inequality with a unique point of maximal violation , the guessing probability is a continuous function of the value of the inequality close to the maximal violation . </S>",
    "<S> this implies in the particular case we are studying that : @xmath64 in appendix [ app5:numbound ] , we also provide a numerical upper bound on the guessing probability @xmath65 by a concave function of the value of @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have reviewed and rigorously expanded on the results in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showing how much randomness can be obtained from a pure entangled two - qubit state for dichotomic measurements . as mentioned , we can obtain more local randomness by considering measurements with more outcomes but it is ultimately limited to two bits @xcite . to go beyond this restrictive limit we work in a more general bell scenario that allows for sequences of measurements ( see fig.[fig : scen ] ) made on the state .    if @xmath67 performs a projective measurement on @xmath68 the post - measurement state now shared between alice and @xmath69 is separable and thus useless for randomness production . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , one needs to consider non - projective measurements to retain some entanglement in the system for the subsequent measurements . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the following two - outcome quantum measurement ( written in the formalism of kraus operators ) : @xmath70 corresponding to the two outcomes @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement @xmath72 can be understood as a noisy version of the projective measurement @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> it varies from being projective ( for @xmath74 ) to being non - interacting ( for @xmath75 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can verify that measuring an entangled state for @xmath760,\\pi/4]$ ] ( non - projective measurement ) the post - measurement state still retains some entanglement , irrespectively of the outcome . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by tuning the parameter @xmath77 we are able to vary the destruction of the entanglement of the state at the gain of extracting information from it ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . intuitively , the closer to being a projective measurement , the lower the entanglement in the post - measurement state , but the bigger the violation of the initial bell inequality .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ a scheme for unbounded randomness certification.__we now combine the previous observations to demonstrate our main result . </S>",
    "<S> first , let us recall that , as shown in @xcite , one can obtain one bit of randomness from any pure entangled two qubit state , irrespectively of the amount of entanglement in it . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can verify that approximately one random bit can be certified if the measurements are close to the ones in ( in the sense that @xmath78 for @xmath79 ) since @xmath66 is then close to @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the measurement in eq . </S>",
    "<S> is only close - to - projective for @xmath77 close to zero and leaves entanglement in the post - measurement state between alice and bob which is thus still useful for randomness certification . by repeated use of these two properties </S>",
    "<S> we can certify the production an unbounded amount of random bits from a single pair of entangled qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we now formally describe this process in which alice makes a single measurement on her share of the state , whereas bob makes a sequence of @xmath17 measurements on his .    </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath15 chooses between measurements of @xmath81 and @xmath82 for inputs @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively , with outcomes @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath85 is fixed before the beginning of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the initial entangled state shared between alice and bob , before @xmath67 s measurement , is @xmath86 ( see with @xmath87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the first non - projective measurement of the operator @xmath88 is made by @xmath67 on the initial state @xmath86 , the post - measurement state is of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 and the two unitaries , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and angle @xmath940,\\pi/4]$ ] depend on the first outcome @xmath95 and the angles @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> after his measurement , @xmath67 applies the unitary @xmath98 , conditioned on his outcome @xmath99 , on the post - measurement state going to @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows @xmath100 to use the same two measurements @xmath101 and @xmath81 independently of the outcome @xmath99 since the unitary @xmath102 is cancelled in . </S>",
    "<S> this last procedure will be applied by each @xmath15 after his measurement , before sending the post - measurement state to the next @xmath18 . if the system passed through _ only _ the non - projective measurements , the state received by @xmath15 can be one of @xmath103 potential states , depending on all of the previous @xmath19 s ( @xmath104 ) outcomes ( one for each combination @xmath105 of outcomes obtained by the previous @xmath19 , these can be computed _ before _ the beginning of the experiment ) . </S>",
    "<S> any of these states can be written as : @xmath106,\\ ] ] where the angles @xmath107 and the matrix @xmath108 both depend on the outcomes @xmath109 , on the initial angle @xmath96 and the angles @xmath110 of the previous @xmath19 s with @xmath104 . in the notation </S>",
    "<S> , we will always omit the dependence on the angles @xmath96 and @xmath111 since these are fixed _ before _ the beginning of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> for each of these different potential states with angle @xmath107 , alice adds two measurements to her input choices , where for @xmath112 , these are measurements of the observables @xmath113 which are defined as @xmath114(u_a^{\\vec{b}_{i-1}})^{\\dagger},\\ ] ] where @xmath115 , depending on the specific state @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now ready to describe how the scheme certifies randomness . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement operator @xmath82 can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath73 by choosing @xmath117 sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> this brings the outcome statistics for measurements @xmath118 on bob s side and @xmath119 on alice s side on the state in eq . </S>",
    "<S> , arbitrarily close to the statistics for the measurements in eq . and a state of the form in eq . </S>",
    "<S> , for @xmath120 . therefore , the inequality @xmath121 for alice and @xmath15 as defined in can be made arbitrarily close to its maximal violation . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn guarantees that the guessing probability , @xmath122 can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this guessing probability does not only describe the instances when alice chooses the measurements @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> since eve does not know alice s measurement choices in advance she can not use a strategy that gives higher predictive power for the instances when alice chooses other measurements . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by making @xmath122 sufficiently close to @xmath63 for each @xmath124 ( by choosing each @xmath85 sufficiently close to @xmath125 ) the digp @xmath126 can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath127 ( see appendix [ app4:arbitrarysequ ] for a proof ) .    at the end </S>",
    "<S> , bob can produce @xmath12 random bits by a suitably chosen sequence @xmath82 , @xmath16 , of @xmath128 measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the certification only requires that each @xmath15 occasionally chooses the projective measurement @xmath81 so that the whole statistics can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> note that bob can choose @xmath81 with probability @xmath129 and @xmath82 with probability @xmath130 for @xmath129 as close to zero as he wants .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarise the idea of the scheme , the post - measurement state after @xmath131 , given a sequence of non - projective measurements , is of the form of . with some probability alice </S>",
    "<S> chooses measurements @xmath132 which give outcome statistics that allow randomness certification of the @xmath124th bit using the @xmath121 inequality . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can certify randomness for each measurement @xmath15 in the sequence at the expense of increasing the number of measurements that alice chooses from . </S>",
    "<S> finally , also remark that the value of _ each _ inequality @xmath121 between each @xmath15 and a can be made as close as wanted to the maximal value @xmath133 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion.__we have presented a scheme for certifying an unbounded amount of random bits from a single pair of entangled qubits where one of the qubits is subjected to a sequence of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements do not completely destroy the entanglement but map the state to another pure entangled two - qubit state ( with reduced entanglement ) . </S>",
    "<S> our main result made use of the fact that every measurement in bob s sequence generated an almost - maximally non - local output distribution ( in the sense of violating some bell inequality almost maximally ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar study was made in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a sequence of non - local correlations was obtained from a single pair of qubits . nevertheless , it was still an open question to know whether it was possible to get a sequence of ( arbitrarily close to ) maximally non - local correlations , and our results show that this is possible , a property that could be of further use for many other device - independent quantum information tasks .    </S>",
    "<S> our results proves that in the sequential scenario one can certify an unbounded amount of randomness . </S>",
    "<S> however , our scheme requires an exponentially increasing number of measurements on alice s side ( @xmath134 measurement choices for @xmath17 measurements in the sequence ) and is not robust to noise . </S>",
    "<S> all these issues deserve further investigation , for instance for the construction of device - independent randomness _ expansion _ protocols in the sequential scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , on a more fundamental level , our results offer new insights in the relation between entanglement , non - locality and randomness . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that a single pair of pure entangled qubits is a potentially unbounded source of certifiable random bits ( and of non - local correlations ) if we perform sequences of measurements on it .    _ </S>",
