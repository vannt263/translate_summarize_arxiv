    "with the crossing of the termination shock ( ts ) by the _ voyager _ 1 and 2 spacecraft @xcite , the post - shock solar wind ( sw ) region , known as the inner heliosheath @xcite , has become an area of increased interest @xcite . despite its non - functioning plasma instrument , _ voyager _ 1 has provided important data on the flow , energetic particle , and magnetic field orientation in the heliosheath , much of which is poorly understood .",
    "now that _ voyager _ 2 has crossed the ts at 84 astronomical units ( au ) , new data will further increase our understanding of the outer reaches of the heliosphere .    although _ in situ",
    "_ measurements by the _ voyager _",
    "spacecrafts are immensely valuable , they do not provide much information about the global structure of the heliosphere - interstellar medium interaction region .",
    "the interstellar boundary explorer ( _ ibex _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will try to infer global heliospheric structure by surveying the sky in energetic neutral atoms ( ena s ) from earth orbit .",
    "ena s are created in the heliosheath after a neutral atom from the local interstellar medium ( lism ) charge - exchanges with a plasma proton . the new neutral atom ( generally hydrogen )",
    "is born from the proton distribution , and , as such , reflects the characteristic plasma conditions at the point of creation .",
    "ena s propagate virtually ballistically ( particularly ena hydrogen ) , subject only to the sun s gravity and radiation pressure . _",
    "ibex _ will directly detect ena s and create all - sky maps at a variety of energies between 10 ev and 6 kev at the rate of one complete map every six months .",
    "the challenge to both data analysts and theorists is how to interpret the ena flux measurements made by the ibex - lo ( 10 ev  2 kev ) and ibex - hi ( 300 ev  6 kev ) instruments .",
    "the ena flux at a given energy will be a function of the properties of the heliosheath along a particular line of sight . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this includes plasma and neutral number densities , plasma flow speed and direction , plasma temperature , and distance to the heliopause ( heliosheath thickness ) .",
    "however , that analysis was limited to energies close the thermal core of the heliosheath distribution , since we did not incorporate high energy tails in the ena parent population due to either pick - up ions , or energetic protons accelerated by other mechanisms .",
    "recently , @xcite used a @xmath0-distribution for the ena parent population to obtain ena maps .",
    "the advantage of using this distribution , as opposed to a maxwellian , is that it has a power - law tail , and is therefore capable of producing ena s at suprathermal energies .",
    "however , the focus in that paper was on the _ ibex _ instrument s response to ena fluxes , and feed - back of ena s on the global solution was not considered .    in this paper",
    "we seek to extend the investigations of @xcite to higher energies by adopting a @xmath0-distribution for heliosheath protons , using an approach similar to @xcite .",
    "the suggestion that the supersonic sw should be described by a @xmath0-distribution rather than a maxwellian has a long history @xcite .",
    "more recently , with the measurement of pui s by _ ulysses _ @xcite , it became apparent that the pui distribution merged cleanly into the solar wind distribution , yielding an extended energetic tail .",
    "this was carried further by @xcite who constructed an extended supersonic sw proton spectrum showing that a high energy tail emerged smoothly from the clearly identifiable low energy solar wind particles .",
    "the results of @xcite showed that not only did a continuous power law tail emerge from the thermal distribution , but this tail merged naturally into higher energies associated with ( low energy ) anomalous cosmic rays ( acr s ) @xcite .",
    "the voyager lecp data obtained in the heliosheath indicates that a power law distribution at thermal energies is maintained , but of course we have no means to show that a tail emerges smoothly from the shocked sw plasma .",
    "nonetheless , we do not expect an abrupt departure from the supersonic sw particle distribution characteristics in that its overall `` smoothness '' should be preserved .",
    "we use a self - consistently coupled mhd - plasma / kinetic - neutral code to compute a steady - state heliosphere with a @xmath0-distribution in the sw , and investigate ena fluxes at 1 au , looking in particular for signatures which can be related to the heliospheric structure .",
    "we begin , however , by investigating the effects of assuming such a distribution on the supersonic and subsonic sw and , due to the non - local coupling mediated by charge - exchanging neutrals , the global heliosphere .",
    "at around 100 astronomical units ( au ) the supersonic sw flow encounters the termination shock ( ts ) , whereupon it becomes subsonic and heated .",
    "the hot subsonic sw fills the inner heliosheath and heliotail ( these features are visible in the computed plasma distributions shown in figure [ fig : hpfzandl07_global ] ) . at the same time , the solar system is thought to travel supersonically through the partially ionized plasma of the lism . as a result , a bow shock forms upstream of the heliosphere , and a tangential discontinuity , known as the heliopause ( hp ) , separates the shocked solar and lism plasmas .",
    "interstellar neutral gas ( primarily hydrogen ) is weakly coupled to the plasma through charge - exchange , but readily traverses the heliopause ( with a filtration ratio of about 45% ) and may be detected near earth at a range of energies that correspond to the creation site of the neutral h , ranging from the lism to the hot heliosheath , to the fast solar wind .    to determine the flux of neutral atoms at 1 au",
    ", we use a steady - state solution obtained from the 3d heliospheric model based on the 3d mhd code of @xcite and a 3d version of the kinetic neutral hydrogen code of @xcite . the first self - consistently coupled 3d application of this code appears in @xcite .",
    "a steady - state is reached by iteratively running the coupled plasma and neutral codes until successive iterations converge .",
    "although several plasma - only models of the heliosphere are still in use , it is now recognized that including neutral atoms in a global model is critical to obtaining the correct location and shape of the termination shock and heliopause , as well as determining the right temperature of the heliosheath , since interstellar neutrals contribute to significant cooling and heating of the inner and outer heliosheath respectively @xcite .",
    "we also note that inter - particle collisions do not significantly alter the neutral distribution and that charge - exchange mean free paths are of the order of the size of the heliosphere , so that neutral atoms should ideally be modelled kinetically , with charge - exchange coupling the neutral and charged populations @xcite .",
    ".boundary conditions for the 3d heliospheric model considered here .",
    "we use a spherical coordinate system , where @xmath1 is the angle in the ecliptic plane around from the meridional plane and @xmath2 is the angle above the ecliptic plane . the solar rotation axis is assumed orthogonal to the ecliptic plane .",
    "the sw is assumed to change from a slow wind to a high speed wind at 35 degrees above the ecliptic plane , as suggested by ulysses observations @xcite of the sw during solar minimum . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      pick - up ions ( pui s ) originate in the sw due to charge - exchange of lism neutrals with sw protons .",
    "however , they do not thermalize with the background sw plasma @xcite and are not therefore equilibrated with the sw . thus , pui s constitute a separate suprathermal population of the sw @xcite .",
    "pui s contribute to the power - law tails observed almost universally in the sw plasma distribution @xcite . a simple way to add a power - law tail , and thereby model the proton ,",
    "energetic particle , and pui populations as a single distribution , is to assume a generalized lorentzian , or `` @xmath0 '' , function @xcite given by @xmath3^{-(\\kappa+1)}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a typical speed related to the effective temperature of the distribution , and is evaluated using the pressure equation ( [ eq : pressure ] ) below .",
    "this distribution has a maxwellian core , a power - law tail which scales as @xmath5 , and reduces to a maxwellian in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "although the core and tail features agree qualitatively with observations , a limitation of the @xmath0 formalism is that it does not allow us to adjust their relative abundances .",
    "the observed flat - topped pui population is also absent in the @xmath0 approximation . in figure",
    "[ fig : kappa1.63_maxwellian ] , we plot a @xmath0-distribution for @xmath6 , along with a maxwellian distribution .",
    "the basic principle in our approach is to note that the mhd equations for the plasma do not change if we assume a @xmath0-distribution for sw protons .",
    "this is facilitated by the fact that the basic fluid conservation laws do not assume any specific form of the distribution function ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "closure at the second moment is possible if the distribution is isotropic , since the heat flux and the off - diagonal components of the stress tensor are then identically zero .",
    "the only difference from conventional fluid dynamics is that the collision integrals do not vanish as they would for a maxwellian distribution .",
    "however , collisional frequencies are so low for the sw that we may neglect these collisional terms and treat the distribution function ( [ eq : kappa_dist ] ) as `` frozen '' into the plasma . even though the sw is effectively collisionless , an mhd approach is still warranted since the plasma has fluid properties perpendicular to the magnetic field , while various wave phenomena help isotropize this ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "for these reasons we solve the regular mhd equations to find the bulk plasma quantities , but in the inner heliosheath we simply interpret these as having come from ( [ eq : kappa_dist ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we assume @xmath6 in all sw plasma , which is a value consistent with the data analysis of @xcite . as we show in section [ sec : ena_spectra ] , observations by the upcoming _ ibex _ mission can be used to estimate @xmath0 in the heliosheath .",
    "the two distribution functions , @xmath0 and maxwellian , used to model the plasma are linked through the choice of @xmath4 , and we reconcile these using the isotropic plasma pressure , given by @xmath7 note that the thermal core collapses as @xmath8 and the pressure becomes undefined .",
    "this limiting case corresponds to a @xmath9 tail @xcite . for the purposes of comparison",
    ", we define an effective temperature for the @xmath0-distribution @xmath10 the temperature profiles depicted in figures [ fig : hpfzandl07_global ] and [ fig : plasma_slices ] refer to the effective temperature .",
    "charge - exchange couples the neutral and plasma populations . however , the charge exchange loss terms are different when we use a @xmath0-distribution for protons . in the appendix",
    "we derive the charge exchange rate for a hydrogen atom traveling through a @xmath0-distribution of protons , which is used in our kinetic code for h atoms in the heliosheath .",
    "other authors have included pick - up ions into their heliospheric models in various different ways .",
    "the bonn model @xcite include pui s as a separate fluid with a source term due to interstellar neutrals charge - exchanging in the supersonic sw , and a sink due to pui s being energized and becoming part of the anomalous cosmic ray population , which is modeled as a separate fluid .",
    "the pui distribution function of the bonn model is assumed to be isotropic and flat - topped between 0 and @xmath11 in the frame of the sw .",
    "although this type of distribution agrees reasonably well with observations of pui s in the supersonic sw @xcite , the validity of the same distribution downstream of the ts is more questionable .",
    "such a distribution also does not have a tail that extends beyond the pick - up energy , which is a requirement for obtaining ena s at high energies .",
    "this model was modified in @xcite to include a significant improvement in the form of the pui distribution , based on the work of @xcite which includes analytic estimates of the effects of upstream turbulence .",
    "although restricted by axial symmetry , this model includes time - dependent effects , and allows the authors to estimate various properties of ena s .",
    "@xcite recently introduced a more complicated pui model based on earlier work by @xcite . in this model a host of different neutral atom and pui populations are tracked kinetically .",
    "this model incorporates more physics than our relatively simple @xmath0-distribution approach , but to manage the added complexity , it also requires a number of additional assumptions .",
    "these include the form of the velocity diffusion coefficient , that the magnetic moment is conserved by pui s as they cross the ts , and an ad hoc assumption about the downstream energy partition between electrons , protons and pui s .",
    "the increased computational requirements also forces @xcite to consider only the case of axial symmetry , thereby neglecting the imf and restricting the ismf to being aligned with the flow .",
    "although their assumptions are reasonable , it is difficult to determine the influence these have on their conclusions .",
    "one of the interesting results from their model is that the locations of the ts , hp and bs change when the effects of pui s are allowed to self - consistently react back on the plasma  a result which agrees quite well quantitatively with our findings in the next section .",
    "in the preceding section we showed that we may solve the regular mhd equations for the plasma in the heliosheath , and interpret these results in terms of a @xmath0-distribution for the ion population .",
    "it is less clear , however , what the effects of @xmath0-distributed neutral atoms originating from the heliosheath will have on the global heliosphere - interstellar medium solution .",
    "figure [ fig : hpfzandl07_dist ] shows the velocity distribution of heliosheath hydrogen at various locations along the lism flow vector .",
    "it is clear from this figure that for a @xmath6 distribution significantly more h - atoms with energies above 1 kev result than for a maxwellian ion population in the heliosheath .",
    "it is also important to note that ena s in the heliotail ( left plot ) show a clear power - law tail ( @xmath12 ) , mirroring the plasma , when a @xmath0-distribution is assumed for heliosheath protons .",
    "these tails persist even outside the heliosphere ( middle and right plots ) for energies above 1 kev .    to test the effect of kev ena s on the global heliosphere",
    ", we ran our code with @xmath6 in the heliosheath , and allowed these ena s to feed back self - consistently on the global solution . since h - atoms are modeled kinetically , this provides no extra difficulty for our model .",
    "the only difference , by comparison with the case of a maxwellian proton distribution , is that we need to use a different formula for the relative motion between a given particle and the ambient plasma .",
    "this formula is derived in the appendix .",
    "figure [ fig : plasma_slices ] compares plasma density and temperature along radial lines in the nose , polar and tail directions for the maxwellian and equilibrated @xmath6 heliosheath cases .",
    "secondary charge - exchange of neutrals created in the hot heliosheath was identified by @xcite as a critical medium for the anomalous transport of energy from the shocked solar wind to the shocked and unshocked lism . in particular , the upwind region abutting the hp experienced considerable heating as a result of secondary charge - exchange of hot ( @xmath13 k ) neutrals with the cold lism protons .",
    "the efficiency of this medium of anomalous heat transfer is increased with a @xmath0-distribution in the inner heliosheath .",
    "this results simultaneously in a shrinking of the inner heliosheath and an expansion of the outer heliosheath .",
    "the inner heliosheath plasma temperature ( defined in terms of pressure ) remains unchanged , because the maxwellian and @xmath0-distributions have the same second moment ( see section [ sec : implications ] ) .",
    "we find that in the nose direction the termination shock moves out by about 4 au , while the heliopause moves inward by about 9 au . the bow shock stand - off distance increases by 25 au , and the shock itself is weakened by the additional heating of the lism plasma by fast neutrals from the sw .",
    "table [ table : distances ] summarizes these changes in heliospheric geometry .",
    "the observed modifications to the heliospheric discontinuity locations agree quite well with the changes observed by the multi - component heliospheric model of @xcite , which includes a kinetic representation of pui s .",
    "these authors report a 5 au increase in the ts distance and a 12 au decrease in the distance to the hp , for an axially symmetric calculation without magnetic fields .",
    "another important distinction between the maxwellian and @xmath0-distribution based models is that the filtration rate of hydrogen changes at the heliopause .",
    "we find that in the maxwellian case the hydrogen density at the ts is about 63% of the interstellar value , while for the @xmath0-distributed model the density drops slightly to 60% . as with the ts and hp locations ,",
    "these results agree quite well with the @xcite model .",
    "the interstellar boundary explorer mission will provide all - sky maps of ena s coming from the inner heliosheath , at 14 energy bands from 10 ev to 6 kev .",
    "however , this data is unusual in that all the ena s detected at a particular pixel and energy bin , will have come from a large volume of space with non - uniform plasma properties . as such it is not possible to invert an ena map to determine the heliosheath s shape , size , and plasma distribution .",
    "for this reason , we need to use forward modeling to help us understand the relationship between model heliosheaths and their corresponding synthetic ena maps . in @xcite",
    ", we identified several possible signatures to infer heliosheath properties from _ ibex _ data .",
    "below we present ena maps and spectra from our improved heliospheric model , and relate these to the properties of our model heliosheath .",
    "ena s propagating from the heliosheath to a detector at 1 au may experience re - ionization due to charge exchange , electron impact ionization , or photo - ionization .",
    "these effects are of major importance close to the sun , and in the simplest approximation scale according to @xmath14 \\;,\\quad \\beta_e \\simeq 6\\times 10^{-7 } { \\rm s}^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a pseudo - particle weight which is initially equal to @xmath16 at the point of charge - exchange and decays with time as a function of position .",
    "alternatively , we can view @xmath17 as the survival probability for a particular particle .",
    "we note here that @xmath18 does not have to be uniform in all directions , so that ionization losses for particles coming in over the poles could be different from those traveling in the ecliptic plane , and it may also have temporal variations .    generally ena s will travel on effectively straight trajectories since solar gravity is approximately balanced by radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite show that for solar minimum conditions the deflection angle will be less than 5 degrees , even for the lowest energies we consider . in the simulations presented here",
    ", we assume zero deflection , since we are mainly interested in the gross features of the ena maps .",
    "trajectory `` a '' in figure [ fig : ibex_path ] shows the shortest straight - line path to 1 au for an ena , while path b represents the longest .",
    "if we assume straight line propagation at constant speed @xmath19 , then the survival probability ( i.e. @xmath17 ) is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 for path a and @xmath22 for path b. upon integration we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the particle speed in au per second . here",
    "path b is relevant to _ ibex _ observations , but experiences more ionization losses .",
    "a simple @xmath25 factor can be used to switch between 1 au fluxes and _ ibex _ fluxes , assuming no deflection due to gravity or radiation pressure occurs .",
    "figure [ fig : ibex_path ] shows survival probability profiles for both paths , and we note that profile `` a '' corresponds to figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "these loss formulae will we used in the next section to undo the losses simulated in the code so that we can use the pristine ena fluxes to construct energy spectra .",
    "such a procedure would also be necessary for _ ibex _ data , when we want to infer properties of the parent plasma .",
    "we may extract information about the proton energy spectrum in the heliosheath by simply plotting the _ ibex _ energy bin data for a particular pixel ( i.e. direction ) .",
    "our global model allows us to both prescribe a form for the distribution function in the heliosheath for ena s ( i.e. @xmath0 ) and then attempt to deconvolve this from the data .",
    "the only difference is that _ ibex _ spectral data will be line - of - sight integrated , rather than at a particular point in space .",
    "nevertheless , we have the global data from our model , which we can use to compare an _ ibex _ line - of - sight spectrum with plasma properties along that line of sight .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the nose direction , where the plasma distribution observed by the _ voyager",
    "_ spacecraft can be compared with the spectral slope inferred from the _ ibex _ data .    to obtain a more accurate representation of the ena spectrum in the heliosheath , we need to undo the ionization losses experienced by particles as they travel to the detector . in section [ sec : ionization_losses ] we derived a simple expression to estimate the survival probability of a particle with a given energy along a particular line of sight .",
    "figure [ fig : ibex_spectra ] shows three energy spectra for ena s originating from the nose , tail and polar directions . for these spectra , we have divided the flux measured at 1 au by the survival probability for each energy band to undo the ionization losses , as mentioned above .",
    "we find that for the three directions considered , the energy spectrum tends toward the value of @xmath26 above about 1 kev .",
    "this result shows that the _ ibex _ data , in spite of being line - of - sight integrated , should be able to help determine the spectral slope of the heliosheath protons in the 0.6  6 kev range .",
    "figure [ fig : ibex_spectra ] also shows that the spectra in the three directions considered have very similar properties",
    ". this will not necessarily be true for the real heliosphere , where the post - shock sw may develop different high energy tails in different directions .",
    "the dotted line ( labeled `` nose2 '' ) is for a spectrum in the nose direction obtained using 32 energy bins ( compared to about 10 non - overlapping _ ibex _ bins ) .",
    "the agreement between this curve and the green markers shows that , for @xmath6 at least , the number of _ ibex _ bins is sufficient to reproduce the spectrum .",
    "the method we use for computing all - sky ena maps is described in @xcite , where we first obtain a steady - state heliosphere and then trace ena s born through charge - exchange in the heliosheath down to 1 au , where these are then binned according to energy and the direction of origin .",
    "additional ionization losses along the particle s trajectory act to `` evaporate '' its computational weight .",
    "the key difference from our previous results is that we now assume a @xmath0-distribution for the heliosheath protons which form the parent population for ena s .",
    "this modification allows us to obtain ena s up to several kev , and is more consistent with sw data .",
    "figure [ fig : skymaps ] shows all - sky ena maps obtained from our steady - state solution with a @xmath0-distribution for heliosheath protons .",
    "the top right plot shows the ena map for 200 ev , which can be compared with our previous work @xcite , where we did not self - consistently couple the plasma and kinetic neutral atoms , and where we assumed a maxwellian proton distribution .",
    "we find that when we use a @xmath0-distribution , the ena flux at 200 ev is two to three times smaller than for the maxwellian case , due to the shape of the proton distribution ( see figure [ fig : kappa1.63_maxwellian ] ) and resulting ena distribution ( figure [ fig : hpfzandl07_dist ] ) , as well as the thinner inner heliosheath resulting from the use of a @xmath0-distribution ( see section [ sec : global_solution ] ) .",
    "as expected , this decrease of medium energy ( 100 s of ev ) ena s is compensated by an increased ena flux above 1 kev .",
    "our results predict a count rate of about 3 atoms per ( @xmath27 sr s kev ) at 6 kev .",
    "less obvious is the decline in low energy flux when compared to the maxwellian results @xcite , even though there are more ena s being generated at the lowest energies ( see figure [ fig : hpfzandl07_dist ] ) .",
    "the principal reason for this is that the sw core temperature is significantly lower when we use @xmath0 , so that these ena s lack the energy to propagate upstream , since the bulk speed exceeds the thermal speed of the core .",
    "this low sw core temperature is in fact qualitatively consistent with the latest _",
    "2 findings @xcite .",
    "the heliosphere depicted in figure [ fig : hpfzandl07_global ] , is commensurate to approximately `` solar minimum '' conditions , with a clearly defined high speed wind emanating from the poles .",
    "the high speed wind gives rise to hotter high latitude heliosheath plasma , which in turn increases the energy of ena s generated in the subsonic polar sw .",
    "the all - sky maps of figure [ fig : skymaps ] show that at energies above about 1 kev , these streams of hot sw dominate the ena flux , while at lower energies the central tail region is the major source of ena s .",
    "comparing skymaps at different energies , we see from figure [ fig : skymaps ] that the qualitative properties do not vary widely over the _ ibex _ energy range .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the results for a maxwellian heliosheath , where we generally see a higher flux coming from the tail than the nose at low energies , and the reverse at high energies @xcite .",
    "this can be attributed to the steep decline in the maxwellian distribution , compared to the much broader @xmath0-distribution ( see figure [ fig : kappa1.63_maxwellian ] ) , which means that particles observed at a given energy have come from plasma with a narrower range of temperatures . in other words ,",
    "the relatively cool plasma in the distant heliotail can still be a significant source of high energy ena s , if we assume it has a @xmath0-distribution . only at the highest energies , above about 2 kev ,",
    "does the nose - tail asymmetry favor the nose direction .",
    "we have used our 3d mhd - kinetic code to investigate the impact of assuming an alternative heliosheath proton distribution , a @xmath0-distribution rather than the more usual maxwellian , on both the sw - lism interaction region , and the observed ena flux at 1 au .",
    "the motivation for this is that pick - up ions , generated when an interstellar neutral atom charge - exchanges in the supersonic solar wind , form high energy tails that are always observed in the solar wind plasma .",
    "the @xmath0-distribution has core and tail features , and is often invoked in data analysis of the sw proton distribution function .",
    "the use of a @xmath0-distribution introduces ( possibly ) more realistic estimates of the ena flux at 1 au , and thereby serves as an important tool in reconciling global heliospheric models with data from the upcoming _ ibex _ mission .",
    "one drawback of this approach is that we can not control the ratio between core and tail populations . while obviously not capturing the full details of the thermal and pui plasma distributions in either the inner heliosheath or throughout the supersonic sw ,",
    "a @xmath0-distribution is nonetheless well grounded in observations as a general representation of the sw distribution function .",
    "we used @xmath28 in our calculations , based on the _ voyager _ 1 lecp data of @xcite .",
    "although the lecp data is for much higher energies than _ ibex _ will measure , we have shown that _",
    "ibex _ data can be used to infer the spectral slope of the heliosheath distribution for energies between 1 kev and 6 kev .",
    "the tails of the energy spectra may have different slopes in different directions ( over the poles , for example ) .    the use of a @xmath0-distribution for the ena parent proton population results in a significant increase of the ena flux at energies above 1 kev , when compared with a maxwellian distribution .",
    "our results predict a count rate of about 3 per ( @xmath27 sr s kev ) at the highest energies considered by _",
    "ibex _ , which is many orders of magnitude higher than could be expected from a maxwellian heliosheath distribution .",
    "at the same time , there is a marked reduction in the flux for intermediate energies , to about half the maxwellian value at a few hundred ev .",
    "we have also calculated the feed back of the revised ena distribution on the global heliospheric solution .",
    "the result is an increased transport of energy from the inner to the outer heliosheath , with a corresponding thinning and expansion of the former and latter .",
    "the distance between the ts and hp decreases by 13 au ( about 25% ) in the nose direction , and the bow shock moves out farther and becomes very weak .",
    "the thinner heliosheath is also partly responsible for the decreased ena flux at energies of a few hundred ev .",
    "finally , we note that we have not considered time - dependent effects in this paper .",
    "@xcite recently looked at the changes in the ena maps when they included a simple model for the solar cycle into their 3d hydrodynamic ( i.e. no magnetic fields ) code which includes a single fluid for neutral gas .",
    "they found cyclic changes in the ena flux at 100 ev , which varied by about 25% .",
    "the observed variations at 1 kev were considerably larger , but because they assumed a maxwellian distribution for protons in the heliosheath , their fluxes were about an order of magnitude lower than ours at this energy .",
    "effectively , they found that fluctuations in ena flux due to the solar cycle are relatively small for energies close to the core of the distribution ( a few hundred ev in the heliosheath ) , while at high energies the changes in ena flux are larger . since the @xmath0-distribution declines much more slowly than the maxwellian away from the core , we expect our ena fluxes to vary by perhaps 50% over a solar cycle for energies relevant to _",

    "<S> by the end of 2008 ( approximately one year , at the time of writing ) , the nasa small explorer ( smex ) mission ibex ( interstellar boundary explorer ) will begin to return data on the flux of energetic neutral atoms ( ena s ) observed from an eccentric earth orbit . </S>",
    "<S> this data will provide information about the inner heliosheath ( the region of post - shock solar wind ) where ena s are born through charge - exchange between interstellar neutral atoms and plasma protons . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed flux will be a function of the heliosheath thickness , the shape of the proton distribution function , the bulk plasma flow , and loss mechanisms acting on ena s traveling to the detector . as such , ena fluxes obtained by ibex can be used to better parametrize global models which can then provide improved quantitative data on the shape and plasma characteristics of the heliosphere . in a recent letter @xcite </S>",
