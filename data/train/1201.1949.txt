    "quantum correlation arises from noncommutativity of operators representing states , observables , and measurements @xcite",
    ". quantum entanglement , which refers to the separability of the states , is very important in quantum information processing and can be realized in many kinds of physical systems which involve quantum correlation .",
    "quantum entanglement has been investigated widely in past decades , while quantum correlation seems to have been seldom exploited before .",
    "an alternative classification for quantum correlations , which is based on quantum measurements , has arisen in recent years and also plays an important role in quantum information theory @xcite . in particular ,",
    "quantum discord @xcite is introduced to measure these quantum correlations . there",
    "exist indeed separable mixed states having nonzero discord , and the separable mixed states can be used to perform useful quantum tasks @xcite .",
    "evaluation of quantum discord in general requires considerable numerical minimization and analytical expressions are known only for certain classes of states .",
    "luo evaluated analytically the quantum discord for a large family of two - qubit states , and make a comparative study of the relationships between classical and quantum correlations in terms of the quantum discord @xcite .",
    "dakic , vedral , and brukner propose a geometrical way of quantifying quantum discord @xcite , which is termed as ` gmod ` . `",
    "gmod ` can be extended to any number of subsystems , though evaluating the measure of discord becomes progressively more difficult with the increasing of the number of subsystems and that of their dimensionality .",
    "moreover , luo and fu @xcite evaluate ` gmod ` for an arbitrary state and obtain an explicit and tight lower bound . very differently , measurement - induced nonlocality ( ` min ` ) @xcite has been proposed to interpret the maximum global effect caused by locally invariant measurements , the authors claim that ` min ` is in some sense dual to ` gmod ` . anyway ,",
    "both ` gmod ` and ` min ` are the measurement tool of quantum correlation .",
    "the interaction of a quantum system with its environment causes the rapid destruction of crucial quantum properties and drives the system to an incoherent state .",
    "it was shown by yu and eberly that entanglement of a bipartite system decays to zero in a finite time , which is called entanglement sudden death ( esd ) , while coherence vanishes exponentially with time to zero @xcite .",
    "subsequently , esd in different systems has been made by various groups @xcite .",
    "al - qasimi and james @xcite demonstrated that a broad class of mixed quantum states undergo esd at finite temperatures .",
    "recently , by using carefully engineered interactions between system and environments , experimental studies have been carried out to demonstrate esd , and esd has been observed both in photons @xcite and in atomics ensembles @xcite .    in this paper , motivated by the work on sudden death of entanglement at finite tem- peratures @xcite , we investigate whether ` gmod ` and ` min ` endure sudden death , their different characteristics are shown .",
    "the qubits system is in finite temperature reservoirs , thus the reservoirs can cause excitation of qubits instead of the energy of the qubits being lost via the spontaneous decay to the environment . for a broad class of mixed quantum states , which includes all of the states studied by yu and eberly and others in connection with this problem ,",
    "we demonstrate that all states can endure sudden death of ` gmqd ` and ` min ` at finite temperatures , and there is no asymptotic decay for ` min ` while asymptotic decay exists for ` gmqd ` .",
    "we consider two two - level atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 that present a two - qubit system and interact with their local thermal reservoirs .",
    "there is no direct interaction between the atoms .",
    "the effect of heat is included in our system .",
    "the dynamics of the density matrix @xmath3 describing the two qubits reads @xcite @xmath4+[\\sigma^{i}_{-}\\rho,\\sigma^{i}_{+}]\\}+\\frac{1}{2}m\\gamma\\sigma^{2}_{i=1}\\{[\\sigma^{i}_{+},\\rho\\sigma^{i}_{-}]+[\\sigma^{i}_{+}\\rho,\\sigma^{i}_{-}]\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the spontaneous emission rate of the atom , and we assume that two atoms have the same value , @xmath6 are the rasing @xmath7 and lowering @xmath8 operators of atom @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the mean occupation number of the reservoir and it also is assumed to be the same for both atoms . on the right hand side of equation ( 1 ) , the first term describes the depopulation of the atoms due to simulated and spontaneous emission , while the second term corresponds to the reexcitations caused by the finite temperature .",
