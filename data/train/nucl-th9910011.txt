    "the study of csv in the interaction of pions with nuclei in the delta resonance region has been of considerable interest for the last two decades . the interaction of pions with light nuclei such as @xmath6 @xcite @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath8 @xcite has attracted particular attention .",
    "however , we note that quite a large data set also exists for scattering of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 as well @xcite .    from the point of view of theory",
    ", the advantage of searching for csv in the scattering of pions from light nuclei is that one can describe pion scattering in these systems in a relatively straight - forward manner . with this in mind , we limit ourselves to the consideration of the scattering of pions from deuterium , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , we anticipate that csv effects are considerably diminished in the case of pion scattering from heavier nuclei because of the importance of processes such as absorption .    first , in order to evaluate the scale of csv effect",
    ", we focus our theoretical efforts primarily on @xmath14 elastic scattering . in a following article",
    ", we will develop the formalism further to investigate csv in the three - nucleon system .",
    "a detailed analysis of the experimental situation will be given in the next section .",
    "here , we want only to point out that in order to make a comparison between experimental data related to different projectile or target , we must deal with the same experimental measurables .",
    "historically , the csv experimental data were given in terms of asymmetry , @xmath15 for the deuteron : @xmath16 and in terms of ratios @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and superratio @xmath19 for the @xmath2 case : @xmath20 both interactions @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the ratio @xmath17 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the ratio @xmath18 are isomirror interactions .",
    "therefore , if charge symmetry is strictly observed , both @xmath17 and @xmath18 would be equal to @xmath25 .",
    "of course , the coulomb interaction is not charge symmetric and would have to be taken into account .",
    "the superratio @xmath19 is the product @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "so , if charge symmetry is universally true , @xmath19 is also equal to @xmath25 .",
    "the experimental data suggests evidence for a small effect in @xmath15 for the deuteron ( e.  g. @xmath26 at 143  mev @xcite ) with some indication of structure at scattering angles around @xmath27 in cm frame . at the same time , a sizable effect is clearly seen in the @xmath2 case .",
    "for example , @xmath28 for @xmath29 = 256  mev and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions for the asymmetry @xmath15 in the deuterium case were given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to describe the asymmetry , authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used a single - scattering approximation with allowance for differently charged @xmath3s(1232 ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the csv effect proved to be independent of the scattering angle with typical value proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "approximately the same approach was used in the @xmath2 case in ref.@xcite .",
    "a different approach for the @xmath2 case was suggested in the paper @xcite .",
    "authors of this paper used an optical potential to describe the pionic @xmath2-amplitudes .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath32 potentials was determined in terms of matter and spin densities for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the coulomb - nuclei interference effect in the vicinity of minima in differential cross sections",
    "was reported as the main reason for the csv effect in @xcite approach . however , this interpretation was disputed by briscoe and silverman @xcite because the authors of @xcite obtained structure only near the @xmath27 in @xmath18 but could not at all explain the overall behavior of the experimental data .    in our investigation , we study the role of double - scattering on csv because of mass splitting of @xmath3-isobars .",
    "it is widely known that the single - scattering approximation reproduces a differential cross section fairly well in the forward hemispere .",
    "but for scattering angles beyond @xmath27 , the double - scattering term is important and should be included .",
    "the influence of multiple scattering terms on differential cross section for deutron case was studied long ago in the papers @xcite @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "but the influence of double and multiple scattering on csv effects was never studied in detail .    in section  iii , we explain how the basic ingredients of the scattering amplitude and constraints such as single- and double - scattering , and the coulomb interaction are combined for @xmath14 elastic scattering .",
    "these results and the prospect for improvement are summarized in section  iv .",
    "the @xmath2 case is considered in forcoming paper .",
    "the csv effect was first observed in the difference of total @xmath33 cross sections in psi and reported in @xcite .",
    "this has been widely discussed , see , e.  g. the book by ericson and weise @xcite .",
    "there have been several measurements for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the first systematic study of the csv effect in the differential @xmath36 cross sections was done at lampf and presented in the paper @xcite . soon after , the asymmetry @xmath15 for @xmath29 = 143  mev was presented for the range of laboratory scattering angles between @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the experiment was repeated for approximately the same range of scattering angles at @xmath29 = 256  mev @xcite .",
    "we note that the structure in the asymmetry seen in @xcite was not seen in the triumf measurements of @xcite .",
    "meantime , some indications for csv effects were also obtained at low energies 30 , 50 , and 65  mev at triumf @xcite .",
    "we also mention the high - energy gatchina data at @xmath29 = 417  mev @xcite which also shows some indications on csv .",
    "we recall that the asymmetry ( [ 1 ] ) , and ratios ( [ 2 ] ) , are two different measures of csv - effects . as in the @xmath2-case , we denote the ratio @xmath39 @xmath40 then , in the case of small magnitudes of csv , we get @xmath41 clearly , this tiny effect would require high - quality data .",
    "smith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported a @xmath71.5% asymmetry in the @xmath14 cross sections at back angles , with uncertainties of 0.6% at the different angles .",
    "the energy dependence of the asymmetry between 30 and 417  mev is shown in fig",
    "we see two possible ways to interpret the experimental situation :    * the _ first _ way is that one may conclude that there is really no effect in deuterium in accordance with statement @xcite and that the effect in the @xmath2 case is influenced correspondingly by specific three - body configurations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . by this , we mean the possible influence of three - body , csv forces which are absent in the @xmath6 case and/or differences in the description of @xmath12 and @xmath13 wave functions ( wf ) as a consequence of an additional coulomb repulsion between two protons in the @xmath12 case ( see in this connection ref .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "the _ second _ scenario is to suggest that the effect may be seen in both cases @xmath6 and @xmath42 , but in deuterium , the effect is small in comparison with @xmath2 .",
    "there should still be some angular dependence for the csv effect in deuterium .",
    "however , masterson _",
    "@xcite have shown that within the impulse single - scattering approximation the angular dependence for csv is absent when only scattering via the @xmath43 is considered .",
    "the inclusion of others s- and p - waves does not change the situation dramatically as all the phases except @xmath43 are small in the region of interest .",
    "so , we need to look beyond the single - scattering approximation and to consider multiple scattering of pions .    1 .   everywhere below",
    ", we shall use the following notations : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the pion energy , @xmath47 are the masses of isobars , and here and below indices @xmath48 in the notations of amplitudes , masses and widths mean the corresponding isobar isospin state : @xmath49 for @xmath50 we suppose @xmath51 .",

    "we shall neglect fermi motion of the nucleon and consider ( for a while ) the expression ( [ 4 ] ) in the static limit , i.  e. @xmath81 .",

    "this is the consequence of the simplification we used .",
    "namely , we took into account the impulse approximation with the @xmath61 scattering in the @xmath43 wave .",
    "as was demonstrated in @xcite , the inclusion of others s- and p - waves does not change the picture dramatically but leads to a smooth dependence of @xmath15 versus scattering angle @xmath103 .",
    "( note , the deviation from calculated constant value is much smaller than the experimental data . ) nevertheless , as was shown in @xcite , the inclusion of the csv effect in the form ( [ 8 ] ) already raises the possibility of describing the observed csv on the deuteron at 143  mev for scattering angles @xmath104 .",
    "3 .   the @xmath14 differential cross section in the approximation ( [ 6 ] ) has a minimum at the scattering angle around @xmath27 , where the non - spin - flip amplitude vanishes .",

    "there are two arguments as to why one may expect the csv - effect to be larger for these nuclei :    * the enchancement of effect in @xmath2 case in comparison to deuteron may take place because of a smaller role of the spin - flip terms in the single - scattering approximation . in this approximation for the deuteron case ,",
