    "obtaining accurate results in strongly - correlated systems remains an extremely difficult task in systems where the sign - problem prevents one to use numerically exact quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "@xcite in the recent past , a large variety of numerical approaches have been proposed and devised to study simple models of interacting electrons on the lattice . among the most promising ones , we mention post density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques , based upon tensor networks .",
    "@xcite as far as insulating phases are concerned , one important issue is to describe mott insulators , in which the insulating character is driven by the strong electron - electron interaction .",
    "when lowering the temperature , the general expectation is that some symmetry - breaking phenomena take place , leading for example to magnetic or peierls ( i.e. , dimerized ) phases . in two spatial dimensions , a continuous symmetry can not be spontaneously broken at finite temperatures ; still , the ground state may possess magnetic long - range order . in this regard ,",
    "the existence of quantum spin liquids , i.e. , states that do not break any symmetry down to zero temperature , in two dimensions represents a fascinating problem .",
    "the key feature to impede long - range ordering is given by the presence of frustrating interaction , namely the presence of competing super - exchange couplings that strongly enhance quantum fluctuations .",
    "the simplest example that captures the low - energy physics of mott insulators and may give rise to spin - liquid ground states is the frustrated heisenberg model : @xmath0 where both @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are spin-@xmath4 operators at each lattice site @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote sum over nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor sites , respectively . here , we consider both the square and kagome lattices with @xmath8 sites : @xmath9 for the square lattice and @xmath10 for the kagome lattice .",
    "all energies are given in units of @xmath1 .",
    "the ground state properties of these two models have been widely debated in the past twenty years , with contradicting results .",
    "recent dmrg calculations suggest that the ground state on the kagome lattice for @xmath11 is a gapped @xmath12 spin liquid ,  @xcite while the ground state of the @xmath13 model on the square lattice is a gapless spin liquid for @xmath14 and a ( gapped ) valence - bond solid for @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite here , we present a variational monte carlo method to assess ground - state properties of these models .",
    "the starting variational wave functions can be substantially improved by the application of few lanczos steps , which can be easily affordable for rather large clusters ( i.e. , few hundreds sites ) .",
    "moreover , the calculation of both the energy and its variance makes it possible to perform a zero - variance extrapolation to estimate exact energies , not only for the ground state but also for low - energy excitations .",
    "the variational wave functions are defined through the mean - field hamiltonian for the abrikosov - fermion representation of the spin-@xmath4 operators :  @xcite @xmath16 where for each bond @xmath17 there are hopping @xmath18 and/or pairing @xmath19 terms ; on - site terms , i.e. , a real chemical potential @xmath20 and/or a complex pairing @xmath21 , may be also considered . given any eigenstate @xmath22 of the mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) , a physical state for the spin model can be obtained by a projection onto the subspace with one fermion per site : @xmath23 is the gutzwiller projector , @xmath24 being the local density .",
    "the flexibility of this approach is given by the fact that _ different _ spin liquids , having for example @xmath25 or @xmath12 gauge structure and gapped or gapless spinon spectrum , may be obtained by changing the pattern of the @xmath18 s and the @xmath19 s .",
    "@xcite moreover , dimerized or chiral states can be also easily obtained within this approach .",
    "@xcite    in the following , we will consider the square lattice with @xmath26 and the kagome lattice with both @xmath11 and @xmath27 , corresponding to cases where the high frustration may stabilize fully symmetric spin liquids .",
    "for the square lattice , we will consider a state that is obtained by taking a real pairing @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 symmetry ) on top of the @xmath25 state with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath30 and real pairing @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 symmetry ) .",
    "the @xmath29 term is responsible for breaking the @xmath25 gauge symmetry down to @xmath12 .",
    "restricting this coupling along the @xmath33 bonds implies four dirac points in the mean - field spectrum .",
    "@xcite for the kagome lattice , we will consider the @xmath25 state that is described by nearest - neighbor real hoppings such to have @xmath34 magnetic flux through triangles and @xmath35 flux through hexagons .",
    "@xcite at the mean - field level , there are gapless excitations at two dirac points",
    ". a slight improvement of the energy can be achieved by considering a next - nearest - neighbor real hopping .",
    "@xcite a gapped wave function , corresponding to a @xmath12 spin liquid ( labelled by @xmath36\\beta$ ] ) can be obtained by adding on - site and next - nearest - neighbor pairing terms .",
    "@xcite a gapless spin liquid with a large fermi surface ( labeled by uniform rvb ) is obtained when no magnetic fluxes are present .    within this formalism , it is straightforward to construct not only an ansatz for the ground state but also for low - energy excitations . in this respect , it is useful to consider a particle - hole transformation for the down electrons on the mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) , i.e. , @xmath37 , such that the transformed hamiltonian conserves the total number of particles",
    ". then , the ground state is obtained by filling the lowest @xmath8 orbitals , with suitable boundary conditions ( either periodic or anti - periodic ) in order to have a unique mean - field state .",
    "spin excitations can be obtained by creating the appropriate bogoliubov quasi - particles ( spinons ) and possibly switching boundary condition . here",
    ", we will consider only the case of a @xmath38 excitation with momentum @xmath39 , for both the square and the kagome lattices . by computing separately the energies of the @xmath40 and @xmath38 states ,",
    "the spin gap @xmath41 is studied as a function of the cluster size .",
    "the energy per site versus the energy variance per site for the @xmath13 heisenberg model on the square lattice with @xmath26 and @xmath42 .",
    "exact lanczos diagonalizations starting from two random initializations ( a ) and quantum monte carlo calculations starting from the best variational state  ( [ eq : psivar ] ) ( b ) are reported.,width=528 ]     the size scaling of the @xmath38 spin gap for the best variational wave function and the zero - variance extrapolation on the square lattice with @xmath26 .",

    "the thermodynamic extrapolation gives @xmath43.,width=268 ]",
    "in order to systematically improve the variational wave functions , we can apply a number @xmath44 of lanczos steps to the starting variational wave function : @xmath45 are @xmath44 additional variational parameters .",
    "clearly , whenever @xmath46 is not orthogonal to the exact ground state , @xmath47 converges to it for large @xmath44 .",
    "unfortunately , on large sizes , only few steps can be efficiently afforded : here , we consider the case with @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 corresponds to the original variational wave function ) . furthermore , an estimate of the exact energy may be obtained by the variance extrapolation . indeed , for accurate variational states @xmath47 with energy @xmath51 and variance @xmath52",
    ", it is easy to prove that @xmath53 where : @xmath54 are the energy and variance per site , respectively . therefore , the exact energy @xmath55 may be extracted by fitting @xmath51 versus @xmath52 and performing a zero - variance extrapolation .",
    "it should be emphasized that the lanczos step procedure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psilan ] ) is not size consistent if @xmath44 is not increased with the number of sites @xmath8 . indeed , both the energy and variance improvements with respect to the original state @xmath46 vanish for @xmath56 and fixed @xmath44 .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that a sizable improvement is obtained even for rather large clusters with few hundred sites .",
    "by contrast , the zero - variance extrapolation remains size consistent , as shown below .",
    "by using the variational monte carlo technique , the properties of the gutzwiller - projected wave function can be easily assessed .",
    "indeed , expectation values of any operator @xmath57 , including @xmath58 , are given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents a complete and orthogonal basis . by interpreting @xmath61 as a probability distribution",
    ", a markov chain can be constructed to sample eq .",
    "( [ eq : average ] ) .",
    "in particular , the gutzwiller projector is automatically implemented by taking @xmath60 written in terms of electron configurations in real space with only singly - occupied sites . within the fermionic representation , an efficient metropolis algorithm can be implemented with local electron moves , e.g. , spin flips , @xmath62 . for @xmath50 , whenever few electrons are moved , the computational cost of @xmath63 only requires @xmath64 operations , while the updating when a new configuration is accepted requires @xmath65 operations . in order to have uncorrelated electron configurations , @xmath8 moves must be done , so that the variational algorithm scales like @xmath66 .",
    "when the first lanczos step is implemented , the only extra cost is that @xmath63 scales as @xmath67 , while the second lanczos step gives @xmath65 ; in both cases the updating algorithm remains @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , up to @xmath49 , the variational calculations have the same computational effort as the @xmath50 case . in some cases ,",
    "in order to have a stable simulation for @xmath44 lanczos steps , it is important to adopt a regularization scheme to avoid vanishingly small determinants . here",
    ", we consider to sample configurations @xmath68 such that : @xmath69 with @xmath70 ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "we start by showing how the lanczos step procedure and the variance extrapolation work for a case where exact diagonalizations are also available , namely the heisenberg model on the square lattice with @xmath42 and @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : square36 ] , we report the calculations for the ground state in two different cases , either by starting from random initial states ( i.e. , what is usually done in the lanczos method ) or by initializing with the best variational wave function  ( [ eq : psivar ] ) . while in the former cases",
    ", many lanczos steps are needed to reach a good energy per site and , therefore , also the linear regime of eq .",
    "( [ eq : extrapol ] ) , the latter one gives excellent results even with two steps , the zero - variance extrapolation being exact within the statistical error .",
    "we would like to stress that abrupt reductions of the energy , with almost constant variance , or even non - monotonic behaviors , can appear when the initial wave function has large overlaps with excited states .    by using the best gutzwiller projected state",
    ", we can extend the lanczos step procedure to larger systems , where exact diagonalizations are not possible . in fig .",
    "[ fig : square ] , we report the calculations for both the @xmath40 ground state and the @xmath38 excitation .",
    "calculations are performed up to @xmath73 with @xmath50 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , and up to @xmath76 with @xmath50 and @xmath74 . even though it is visible that the energy / variance gain reduces when increasing @xmath77 , the slope of the fit remains similar , allowing a size - consistent zero - variance extrapolation . from these results ,",
    "the @xmath38 gap is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : squarefinal ] .",
    "we expect a vanishing gap in the thermodynamic limit for the variational calculations with @xmath50 , since the @xmath12 gauge structure is not expected to alter the mean - field properties .",
    "@xcite however , our numerical results up to @xmath78 can not definitively confirm this fact .",
    "most importantly , the zero - variance extrapolation for the gap suggests that the frustrated heisenberg model on the square lattice is gapless for @xmath26 .",
    "energies per site for the @xmath40 states for the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice on @xmath79 sites ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) for @xmath11 ( a ) and @xmath81 ( b ) .",

    "the thermodynamic extrapolation gives @xmath83.,width=249 ]    let us move to the kagome lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome48 ] , we report the variance extrapolation for a small lattice with @xmath79 sites ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) for both @xmath11 and @xmath81 . for the former case ,",
    "no matter what is the initial state ( gapless with dirac points or a large fermi surface , or even gapped ) , the extrapolated energy is the same , within the statistical errors . notice , however , that the actual values of the initial energies and variances are quite different for these three cases .",
    "by contrast , for the case with @xmath27 , a rather different behavior is found when starting from the @xmath25 dirac state or the @xmath12 gapped one .",
    "remarkably , although the latter one gives a slightly better variational energy for @xmath50 , the lanczos extrapolation performs much better for the dirac state , where a smooth fit is possible . instead , for the @xmath36\\beta$",
    "] state , the second lanczos step makes a sensible energy gain , while the variance does not improve .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of what is seen when the initial wave function has some large overlap with excited states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : square36 ] for the square lattice ) . the evidence that the @xmath36\\beta$ ] state is not a good approximation even when",
    "@xmath11 is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagomej20 ] . for @xmath84 , the lanczos extrapolation of the @xmath25 dirac spin liquid",
    "gives a better energy than the one obtained from the @xmath12 state .    by performing a size - scaling extrapolation of the gap by using the @xmath25 dirac state",
    ", we obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagomefinal ] .",
    "first of all , it is clear that the gutzwiller projector does not open a spin gap on top of the dirac state : this is a non - trivial outcome , given the fact that a @xmath25 gauge structure may give rise to strong interactions among spinons that may completely change the mean - field picture .",
    "most importantly , also after the lanczos step extrapolation , the system is compatible with a gapless spectrum .",
    "in summary , we have shown that extremely accurate calculations for the energy per site are possible in frustrated two - dimensional lattice by using variational wave functions that are built from abrikosov fermions .",
    "few lanczos steps can be applied to the pure variational state , giving a remarkable energy gain , also for clusters with few hundreds sites . moreover , performing a zero - variance extrapolation , it is possible to obtain accurate values of the exact energies , not only for the ground state but also for excited states .",
