    "in its simplest form , the water - wave problem concerns the flow of an incompressible inviscid fluid with a free surface over a horizontal impenetrable bed . in this situation ,",
    "the fluid flow is described by the euler equations with appropriate boundary conditions , and the dynamics of the free surface are of particular interest in the solution of this problem .",
    "there are a number of model equations which allow the approximate description of the evolution of the free surface without having to provide a complete solution of the fluid flow below the surface . in the present contribution ,",
    "interest is focused on the derivation and evaluation of a nonlocal water - wave model known as the whitham equation .",
    "the equation is written as @xmath0 where the convolution kernel @xmath1 is given in terms of the fourier transform by @xmath2 @xmath3 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath4 is the undisturbed depth of the fluid , and @xmath5 is the corresponding long - wave speed . the convolution can be thought of as a fourier multiplier operator , and represents the fourier symbol of the operator .",
    "the whitham equation was proposed by whitham @xcite as an alternative to the well known korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xmath6 the validity of the kdv equation as a model for surface water waves can be described as follows .",
    "suppose a wave field with a prominent amplitude @xmath7 and characteristic wavelength @xmath8 is to be studied .",
    "the kdv equation is known to produce a good approximation of the evolution of the waves if the amplitude of the waves is small and the wavelength is large when compared to the undisturbed depth , and if in addition , the two non - dimensional quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are of similar size . the latter requirement can be written in terms of the stokes number as @xmath11 while the kdv equation is a good model for surface waves if @xmath12 , one notorious problem with the kdv equation is that it does not model accurately the dynamics of shorter waves .",
    "recognizing this shortcoming of the kdv equation , whitham proposed to use the same nonlinearity as the kdv equation , but couple it with a linear term which mimics the linear dispersion relation of the full water - wave problem .",
    "thus , at least in theory , the whitham equation can be expected to yield a description of the dynamics of shorter waves which is closer to the solutions of the more fundamental euler equations which govern the flow .",
    "the whitham equation has been studied from a number of vantage points during recent years . in particular , the existence of traveling and solitary waves has been established in @xcite .",
    "well posedness of a similar equation was investigated in @xcite , and a model with variable depth has been studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in @xcite that periodic solutions of the whitham equation feature modulational instability for short enough waves in a similar way as small - amplitude periodic wave solutions of the water - wave problem .",
    "however , it appears that the performance of the whitham equation in the description of surface water waves has not been investigated so far .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to give an asymptotic derivation of the whitham equation as a model for surface water waves , and to confirm whitham s expectation that the equation is a fair model for the description of time - dependent surface water waves . for the purpose of the derivation",
    ", we introduce an exponential scaling regime in which the whitham equation can be derived asymptotically from an approximate hamiltonian principle for surface water waves . in order to motivate the use of this scaling , note that the kdv equation has the property that wide classes of initial data decompose into a number of solitary waves and small - amplitude dispersive residue @xcite . for the kdv equations ,",
    "solitary - wave solutions are known in closed form , and are given by @xmath13 for a certain wave celerity @xmath14 .",
    "these waves clearly comply with the amplitude - wavelength relation @xmath15 which was mentioned above .",
    "it appears that the whitham equation - as indeed do many other nonlinear dispersive equations - also has the property that broad classes of initial data rapidly decompose into ordered trains of solitary waves ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "quantifying the amplitude - wavelength relation for these solitary waves yields an asymptotic regime which is expected to be relevant to the validity of the whitham equation as a water wave model .",
    "as the curve fit in the right panel of figure 1 shows , the relationship between wavelength and amplitude of the whitham solitary waves can be approximately described by the relation @xmath16 for certain values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since the whitham solitary waves are not known in exact form , the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 have to be found numerically .",
    "then one may define a whitham scaling regime @xmath19 and it will be shown in sections 2 and 3 that this scaling can be used advantageously in the derivation of the whitham equation .",
    "the derivation proceeds by examining the hamiltonian formulation of the water - wave problem due to zhakarov , craig and sulem @xcite , and by restricting to wave motion which is predominantly in the direction of increasing values of @xmath20 .",
    "the approach is similar to the method of @xcite , but relies on the new relation .    .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    first , in section 2 , a whitham system is derived which allows for two - way propagation of waves .",
    "the whitham equation is found in section 3 . finally , in section 4 , a comparison of modeling properties of the kdv and whitham equations is given .",
    "the comparison also includes the regularized long - wave equation @xmath21 which was put forward in @xcite and studied in depth in @xcite , and which is also known as the bbm or pbbm equation .",
    "the linearized dispersion relation of this equation is not an exact match to the dispersion relation of the full water - wave problem , but it is much closer than the kdv equation , and it might also be expected that this equation may be able to model shorter waves more successfully than the kdv equation .",
    "however , as will be seen , solutions of the whitham equation appear to give a closer approximation to solutions of the full euler equations than either or in most cases investigated .",
    "the surface water - wave problem is generally described by the euler equations with slip conditions at the bottom , and kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions at the free surface .",
    "assuming weak transverse effects , the unknowns are the surface elevation @xmath22 , the horizontal and vertical fluid velocities @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and the pressure @xmath25 . if the assumption of irrotational flow is made , then a velocity potential @xmath26 can be used . in order to nondimensionalize the problem ,",
    "the undisturbed depth @xmath4 is taken as a unit of distance , and the parameter @xmath27 as a unit of time . for the remainder of this article ,",
    "all variables appearing in the water - wave problem are considered as being non - dimensional .",
    "the problem is posed on a domain @xmath28 which extends to infinity in the positive and negative @xmath20-direction . due to the incompressibility of the fluid",
    ", the potential then satisfies laplace s equation in this domain .",
    "the fact that the fluid can not penetrate the bottom is expressed by a homogeneous neumann boundary condition at the flat bottom .",
    "thus we have @xmath29 the pressure is eliminated with help of the bernoulli equation , and the free - surface boundary conditions are formulated in terms of the potential and the surface excursion by @xmath30 the total energy of the system is given by the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy , and normalized such that the potential energy is zero when no wave motion is present at the surface . accordingly",
    "the hamiltonian function for this problem is @xmath31 defining the trace of the potential at the free surface as @xmath32 , one may integrate in @xmath33 in the first integral and use the divergence theorem on the second integral in order to arrive at the formulation @xmath34 \\",

    "it will be convenient for the present purpose to formulate the hamiltonian in terms of the dependent variable @xmath42 .",
    "to this end , we define the operator @xmath43 by @xmath44 as was the case with @xmath35 , the operator @xmath43 can be expanded in a taylor series around zero as @xmath45 in particular , note that @xmath46 . in non - dimensional variables ,",

    "this system will be a stepping stone on the way to a derivation of , but may also be of independent interest . consider a wavefield having a characteristic wavelength @xmath8 and a characteristic amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "taking into account the nondimensionalization , the two scalar parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 appear . in order to introduce the long - wave and small amplitude approximation into the non - dimensional problem , we use the scaling @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "this induces the transformation @xmath58 if the energy is nondimensionalized in accord with the nondimensionalization mentioned earlier , then the natural scaling for the hamiltonian is @xmath59 .",

    ", dx dz.\\ ] ] however , the difference between @xmath72 and @xmath73 is below the order of approximation , so that it is possible to formally define the truncated hamiltonian with @xmath72 instead of @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the whitham system is obtained from the hamiltonian as follows : @xmath74 one may also derive a higher - order equation by keeping terms of order @xmath75 , but discarding terms of order @xmath76 . in this case",
    "we find the system @xmath77",
    "in order to derive the whitham equation for uni - directional wave propagation , it is important to understand how solutions of the whitham system - can be restricted to either left or right - going waves . as it will turn out , if @xmath41 and @xmath60 are such that @xmath78 , then this pair of functions represents a solution of - which is propagating to the right .",
