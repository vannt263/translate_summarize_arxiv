    "the hotspots of powerful fanaroff - rilley type ii [ frii ; fanaroff & riley 1974 ] radio galaxies and quasars are the locations where the jets of these sources , after propagating for distances up to @xmath2 mpc , terminate in a collision with the intergalactic medium .",
    "the optical emission observed in several hotspots suggests that at least a fraction of the electrons that goes through the shock(s ) formed at the termination of the jets undergoes efficient particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ results show that while in some sources ( e.g. cygnus a ; wilson et al .",
    "2000 ) the hotspot x - ray emission is consistent with synchrotron - self compton radiation from relativistic electrons in energy equipartition with the magnetic field ( ssce ) , in other sources ( e.g. the hotspot on the jet side of pictor a ; wilson et al .",
    "2001 , hardcastle & croston 2005 , migliori et al .",
    "2007 , tingay et al . 2008 ) the x - ray emission is at a much higher level ( by up to a factor of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the nature of this anomalously bright ( significantly brighter than ssce ) x - ray hotspot emission remains a matter of active discussion in the literature , being connected to the issue of particle acceleration efficiency and jet power [ for two recent reviews see harris & krawczynski ( 2006 ) and worall ( 2009 ) ] and extending to a similar and possibly related issue for the knots of powerful jets ( e.g. kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) .",
    "two different considerations appear to be relevant to the collective properties of hotspot x - ray emission , relativistic beaming and hotspot luminosity ; however , it is not as yet clear how exactly these may be combined to reproduce the observed phenomenology .",
    "based on early _ chandra _ results , suggesting that in most cases the anomalously bright x - ray hotspots were seen at the approaching jet of sources with jets forming relatively small angles to the observer s line of sight , georganopoulos & kazanas ( 2003 ) proposed that the x - ray emission is beamed , and that the plasma in the hotspot is relativistic and decelerating from a bulk lorentz factor @xmath4 to velocities that match the subrelativistic advance speed of lobes ( @xmath5 ; arshakian & longair 2001 ) . in this scenario",
    "the x - ray emission is mostly due to upstream compton ( uc ) scattering of electrons in the upstream fast ( @xmath4 ) part of the flow , inverse - compton scattering the synchrotron photons produced downstream .",
    "the relevance of beaming is also supported by a study of quasar hotspots by tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that concluded that the anomalously bright x - ray emission is indeed found mostly on the hotspot corresponding to the approaching jet side , although these authors favor the cosmic microwave background as a source of seed photons . on the other hand , hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find only weak evidence that the anomalously x - ray bright hotspots are more frequently found at the termination of the approaching jet .",
    "the second consideration , namely the hotspot luminosity , was introduced by @xcite , who found that the synchrotron emission seen at radio energies extends to the optical for lower power sources like 3c 445 @xcite but cuts off before the optical regime for powerful sources like cygnus a @xcite .",
    "they explained this as a consequence of radiative losses increasing with hotspot luminosity . the luminosity range over which this decrease of the synchrotron peak frequency with increasing luminosity is observed , was extended to powerful hotspots by @xcite .",
    "based on an extensive sample of hotspot multiwavelength data , @xcite argued for the relevance of the hotspot luminosity to the x - ray emission , by showing that hotspots with x - ray luminosity much higher than that predicted by ssce were usually of low luminosity , in contrast to more powerful hotspots .",
    "however , instead of uc , @xcite favored synchrotron emission from an altogether separate electron population as the source of the anomalously bright x - ray emission .",
    "other workers have also come to the conclusion that synchrotron radiation from a second electron population is the most likely emission mechanism for this component ( e.g. , in the case of pic a , see fan et al .",
    "2008 , tingay et al . 2008 ) , partly as a result of observing compact radio hotspots with the vlba .    synchrotron radiation ,",
    "but from a single electron population , is indeed the x - ray emission mechanism for the jets of low power fr i radio galaxies , as seen from their single component radio - optical - x - ray spectra ( e.g. perlman & wilson 2005 for the jet of m 87 ) .",
    "this turns out to be the case also for some of the weakest hostspots of fr ii radio galaxies : the northern hotspot of 3c 390.3 @xcite , the northern hotspots of 3c 33 @xcite , the eastern hotspots of 3c 403 @xcite and both hotspots of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it comes as no surprise that in these sources their x - ray emission is much higher than the anticipated ssc flux , since the x - ray emission is indeed the continuation of the radio - optical synchrotron spectrum to higher energies .",
    "we therefore do not consider sources that exhibit a single spectral component from radio to x - ray emission to be part of the family of hotspots exhibiting anomalously high x - ray emission .    an additional handle in understanding the x - ray emission process of the anomalously x - ray bright hotspots ( those for which the x - rays ( i ) can not be a continuation of the synchrotron spectrum and ( ii ) are significantly brighter than predicted by ssce ) can come from spatial displacements between the emission at different frequencies . in a handful of these hotspots , displacements between the radio and the x - ray hotspot emission have been observed , with the x - rays being upstream of the radio : 3c 351 @xcite , 4c 74.26 @xcite , 3c 390.3 and 3c 227 @xcite , 3c 321 @xcite , 3c 353 @xcite .",
    "_ so far no displacements have been observed in the hotspots of sources for which their x - ray emission is consistent with ssce .",
    "_ an additional important characteristic is that when optical - ir emission is detected from these hotspots ( as in 3c227 , 3c 390.3 , 3c 351 ) it coincides with or is shifted somewhat upstream of the radio , to a location downstream of the x - rays .",
    "beaming in the hotspots that exhibit displacements can be a relevant but not a dominant influence , because , while in three of them the hotspots are in the approaching jet that points toward us ( 4c 74.26 , 3c 227 , 3c 351 ) , in two others ( 3c 321 and 3c 353 ) , the jets are believed to be close to the plane of the sky , while in superluminal 3c 390.3 the hotspot exhibiting the x - ray radio displacement is at the termination of the counter jet .",
    "similarly , a low hotspot power does not seem to be strictly required , since the hotspot of 3c 351 is rather powerful and still exhibits the displacements mentioned above .",
    "in this paper we present _ chandra _ x - ray observations and discuss the x - ray emission mechanism of the hotspots of 3c 445 , a broad line fr ii radio galaxy at redshift @xmath7 @xcite , which for the standard cosmology ( @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) corresponds to a luminosity distance of @xmath12 mpc .",
    "this is a promising source for constraining the hotspot x - ray emission mechanism with high resolution _",
    "chandra _ observations .",
    "both its southern and northern hotspots have been detected in the radio and in the near - ir / optical , with the southern hotspot being @xmath13 times brighter than the northern and having multiple sites of synchrotron optical emission , a manifestation of ongoing particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "the hotspot - counter hotspot luminosity difference can be intrinsic , or due to mild beaming with the southern hotspot being on the approaching jet side .    in the first case , adopting the suggestion of @xcite , we expect x - ray emission brighter than ssce from both hotspots , because this is a source with a modest extended power at @xmath14 mhz , @xmath15 w hz@xmath9 sr@xmath9 @xcite , as well as a low @xmath16 ghz luminosity from both hotspots ( @xmath17 w hz@xmath9 sr@xmath9 for the northern hotspot and @xmath18 w hz@xmath9 sr@xmath9 for the southern hotspot @xcite ) . in this scenario , the x - ray emission from the weaker northern hotspot is expected to be higher than predicted by the x - ray to radio ratio from the brighter southern hotspot .",
    "this model makes no prediction regarding offsets between emission in different bands .    in the second case",
    ", we expect that due to beaming , the presumed approaching - jet side , southern hotspot will have more pronounced x - ray emission .",
    "in the context of a relativistic decelerating hot spot flow @xcite , we also expect to observe offsets , with the x - rays peaking upstream of the radio . if , in addition , distributed particle acceleration takes place ( as suggested by prieto et al .",
    "2002 ) , the optical and radio emission will peak at the same location ( see figure 3 of georganopoulos & kazanas 2004 ) .",
    "3c 445 has been the subject of several x - ray observations .",
    "_ ginga _ observations were reported by pounds ( 1990 ) , while _ asca _ observations were reported by sambruna et al .",
    "both observations reported an absorbed seyfert nucleus with a hard x - ray continuum .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations of 3c 445 were previously published by @xcite and @xcite , but in those data a partial window configuration was chosen for the mos and pn that caused both the northern and southern hotspots to be at locations where the ccds were not read out .",
    "this work thus represents the first study of extended x - ray emission from this object , and we report the discovery of x - ray emission from the southern hotspot , as well as a meaningful x - ray flux upper limit from the northern hotspot . in ",

    "3 we present and contrast the morphology seen in each band for the southern hotspot . in ",
    "4 we discuss the x - ray emission mechanism of the southern hotspot , present our conclusions and suggest directions for future work .",
    "3c 445 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on the chandra x - ray observatory on 18 october 2007 for 50ks .",
    "the acis - s configuration was used due to its linear alignment which allowed all emission regions ( in particular both hotspots ) to be included in the observation .",
    "the northern and southern hot spots are at projected distances of @xmath19 300 kpc ( more than 5 arcminutes in angular distance ) from the core of the galaxy . however , because of the greater surface brightness of the southern hotspot ( seen in the radio and near - ir ) we decided to center it in the observations to maximize our sensitivity and angular resolution in this region .",
    "the _ chandra _ observations were reduced in the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package .",
    "standard recipes ( i.e. , the _ science threads _ ) were followed for imaging spectroscopy of extended sources as well as data preparation and filtering .",
    "no significant flare events were seen during the observation , so all data could be used in the analysis .",
    "we extracted spectra for the southern hotspot and nucleus , and created an exposure map to allow a search for emission from other source regions .",
    "all x - ray spectra were fitted in xspec .",
    "this process is discussed in  3 .",
    "deep optical and near - infrared observations of the northern and southern hot spots were obtained by @xcite with the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) and the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) in the k@xmath20 ( 2.2 @xmath21 m ) , h ( 1.7 @xmath21 m ) , j@xmath20 ( 1.2 @xmath21 m ) , and i ( 0.9 @xmath21 m ) bands ; deeper images in these same bands plus the r ( 0.7 @xmath21 m ) and b ( 0.45 @xmath21 m ) bands were obtained by @xcite .",

    "the vlt image was registered to this frame by comparing to palomar sky survey and usno - a2.0 data .",
    "the radio galaxy itself could not be used for this procedure , as it was out of the field of view of both the vlt and vla images .",
    "it was therefore necessary to use stars in the field to do the registration .",
    "we then checked the alignment of the radio and optical images by overplotting the two , in the process reproducing the prieto et al .",

    "this corresponds to an equipartition magnetic field , @xmath75 g . as can be seen , while the synchrotron sed clearly extends below the lowest radio frequency safely associated with the hotspot [",

    "existing low fequency radio observations suggest such a break for the eastern hotspot of cygnus a @xcite . for 3c 445 , vla observations at 74 mhz and 330 mhz ( kassim et al .",
    "2007 ) , provide us with upper limits for the emission of the hotspots ( due to lobe contamination ) .",
    "the low frequency data plotted in figure [ fig : sed ] may be contaminated by lobe emissions and hence are not sufficient to constrain the spectral shape below 4.8 ghz . if a low frequency break is found by future low frequency - high resolution observations , they will strengthen the above picture .",
    "if on the other hand the low frequency radio spectrum exhibits no such break , we will have to search for an alternative reason for the lack of cooling break ( as we discussed above , a low value for @xmath54 , manifested through a lack of low frequency break , requires a higher value for @xmath69 , which in turns produces a cooling break below the optical , as can be seen from the thin solid line in figure [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "distributed reacceleration is a very plausible candidate and it has been claimed to explain the optical emission of 3c 445 ( e.g. prieto et al . 2002 ) .",
    "any interpretation of the x - rays must take into account ( @xmath92 ) the level and spectrum of the x - ray emission , ( @xmath93 ) the apparent upstream ` nesting ' of the x - ray emission into the hollow part of the east - west arc of radio  optical emission , and ( @xmath94 ) the mostly westward displacement of the x - ray emission relative to the peak of the radio - nir 1 hotspot .",
    "also , because of the moderate hotspot to counterhotspot flux ratio in the radio and optical , it should not invoke significant beaming for the radio - optical emitting plasma .",
    "these considerations automatically exclude the possibilities of one zone ec / cmb @xcite and ssc in equipartition , because in these models both the ssc and ec / cmb emission is cospatial with the radio  optical hotspot emission and ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) is much lower than the x - ray detected flux ) .",
    "a displacement between the x - ray and radio emission is predicted in the case of uc emission from a decelerating flow , in which freshly accelerated relativistic electrons from the fast base of the flow upscatter to high energies the radio photons produced in the downstream slow part of the flow by electrons that have cooled radiatively @xcite .",
    "this version of the uc emission from a decelerating flow is not favored , however , as it predicts that the optical and the x - rays are co - spatial and that the radio emission is shifted downstream .",
    "this is because optical emission can only be produced by the fast , upstream part of the flow , where the freshly accelerated electrons are found , the same place from which the uc x - rays are produced .",
    "also , the model predicts the optical to be more beamed than the radio , something not supported by the very similar hotspot to counter - hotspot flux ratio in radio and optical .",
    "finally , the model uses as seed photons the synchrotron photons produced in the source , making the implicit assumption that these photons dominate the local photon energy density .",
    "this is not the case , as can be seen in figure [ fig : seeds ] .",
    "the fact that the x - ray emission is displaced from the radio - optical hotspot requires the x - ray emitting electrons to also be displaced from the radio - optical emitting electrons .",
    "if the x - ray emission is of ic nature , these electrons will experience the seed photon field of figure [ fig : seeds ] , provided they are located at a distance from the radio - optical hostspot not much greater than the radio - optical hotspot size .",
    "this immediately excludes the ir - optical photons as seed photons for the x - ray emission , because this would require the presence of a powerful component of ic emission due to cmb photons upscattered in @xmath19 the optical band , co - located with the x - ray component .",
    "this is not observed .",
    "we therefore reach the conclusion that _ if the x - ray emission is due to a particle population located upstream of those in other bands , then the seed photons that these electrons upscatter must be the cmb .",
    "_    a model that produces co - spatial radio - optical synchrotron emission and ec / cmb x - ray emission shifted upstream , has been proposed by @xcite to address such displacements observed in the large scale jets of quasars .",
    "the model assumes that distributed particle acceleration offsets radiative losses . in this model , a relativistic decelerating flow results in an increase of the magnetic field and electron density at the slow downstream part of the flow , increasing the synchrotron emissivity . at the same time , the faster upstream part of the flow experiences a higher cmb comoving energy density @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the bulk lorentz factor of the flow ( see figure 3 of georganopoulos & kazanas 2004 ) . in this scenario",
    "the only displacement observed is along the flow axis . in our case , however , besides the general upstream shift of the x - rays relative to the radio  nir emission , we note that the peak of the radio  nir 1 emission is shifted by @xmath97 to the east relative to the center of the x - rays ( @xmath98 corresponds to @xmath99 kpc ) . therefore , for this model to still be viable , the flow needs to bend to the east after producing the x - ray emission .    to demonstrate how this could reproduce the observed upstream x - ray emission , we plot in figure [ fig : sedx ] the emission that would result from plasma in equipartition moving with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath100 at an angle to the line of sight @xmath101 and carrying the same power as that injected in the radio - optical hotspot ( @xmath102 erg s@xmath9 ) .",
    "although such a small angle to the line of sight , bordering angles typical of blazars is admittedly uncomfortable , it can not be excluded for this broad line fr ii radio galaxy . to reproduce the shift of the radio - optical emission in nir 1 relative to location of the x - ray emission",
    ", the flow must bend to the east , forming an angle of @xmath103 to the line of sight .",
    "the projected physical distance between the x - ray and radio - optical components is 4.6 kpc .",
    "bends in the flow and velocity gradients at the hotspots , such as the one suggested here , are seen in numerical simulations of relativistic flows ( e.g. aloy et al .",
    "deceleration from @xmath100 to the subrelativistic speed of the radio - optical hotspot could be achieved by a series of oblique shocks that could also aid electron re - acceleration .",
    "this latter possibility could be tested by future , high - resolution radio imaging of the hotspot .",
    "if indeed this is the x - ray emission mechanism , we expect that due to relativistic dimming , the x - ray emission from the counter hotspot would be undetectable , even for very deep _ chandra _ exposures . on the assumption of hotspot - counter hotspot symmetry",
    ", x - ray detection of the counter hotspot would exclude this last alternative for an inverse compton interpretation of the x - rays .",
    "an alternative model , which avoids the uncomfortably small jet angle to the line of sight and the relatively high lorentz factor of the x - ray emitting plasma needed for the above interpretation , together with the arguments against strong beaming in other sources ( see  [ intro ] ) , is to generate the x - ray emission via synchrotron radiation from a high energy population ( @xmath104 ) of electrons accelerated upstream of the radio - optical hotspot . a possible way to produce this electron population upstream",
    "the radio - optical emitting region is through acceleration in the reverse shock of a reverse - forward shock structure ( in this picture the radio - optical comes from electron acceleration in the forward shock ; kataoka et al . (",
    "2008 ) proposed it , motivated by the upstream , relative to the radio , x - ray emission seen in both hotspots and jets of 3c 353 ) .",
    "this scheme , however , as kataoka et al .",
    "( 2008 ) note , does not address the reason the two shocks accelerate electrons at different energies , with the reverse shock consistently reaching higher electron energies . if the x - ray emission of the southern hotspot is synchrotron , then the observed emission in the _ chandra _ band must lie close to the peak of its @xmath105 emission .",
    "this is because the x - ray photon index is @xmath106 and the luminosity of this component at optical energies must be below the level of the optical emission detected downstream .",
    "the emission could in principle extend to energies higher than the _",
    "chandra _ band but this would require the presence of unrealistically energetic electrons . ) because cooling of the x - ray emitting electrons is severe , even if we only consider the cmb photon energy density , these electrons are suffering strong cooling , which must be balanced by continuous reacceleration .    finally , an account of most of the phenomenology may rest with the possibility that the entire radio - nir - x - ray emission is synchrotron , and that the jet beam moves laterally with time to the west , implying that the maximum x - ray emission is the most recent and naturally further displaced from the agn core .",
    "for this same reason ( age ) there is less ir and almost no radio emission in along this direction ( the corresponding electron radiative times are longer ) .",
    "the fact that the radio emitting electrons have the longest radiative lifetime would then explain the displacement of the maximum emission at this frequency ( and of the ir ) to the east and the absence of x - rays in the same region ( the x - ray emitting electrons have all cooled to lower energies ) .",
    "there is some indication of such a motion from the fact that the agn core and the two lobes do not all line on a straight line .    to conclude , both the ec / cmb from a decelerating flow and synchrotron interpretation of the x - rays face important problems , although the ec / cmb model is more constrained and , therefore , easier to falsify , while the synchrotron interpretation can reproduce any observed emission by introducing additional electron populations as needed .",
    "a purely spectral discrimination between the synchrotron and inverse - compton models is not possible , as both can be made compatible with various x - ray slopes as well as the forms for the valley in between the x - ray and radio - ir components ( see e.g. , uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; jester et al . 2007 ; and hardcastle et al . 2004 ) . the synchrotron interpretation ,",
    "however , does not require beaming and is the only alternative among those examined that could produce detectable x - ray emission from the counter - hotspot .",
    "therefore , detection of bright x - ray emission from the counter hotspot in future x - ray observations would rule out any reasonable ic models for the hotspots of 3c 445 .",
    "an additional test of the nature of the x - ray emission could come from future x - ray polarimeters like gems : while the synchrotron emission is expected to be highly polarized , the ec / cmb should produce negligible polarization ( begelman & sikora 1987 , mcnamara et al .",
    "2009 , uchiyama & coppi in prep . ) .",
    "an approach that can yield results with our current observational capabilities is based on hst uv polarimetry : if the far uv emission is shown to be the low energy tail of the x - ray component as is the case with 3c 273 ( e.g. jester et al .",
    "2007 ) , then uv hst imaging polarimetry of the hotspots will distinguish between the ec / cmb and synchrotron mechanisms ( e.g. , mcnamara et al .",
    "2009 , uchiyama & coppi , in prep . ) .",
