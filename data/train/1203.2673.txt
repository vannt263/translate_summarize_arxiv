    "how `` active '' is the interior of a living cell ?",
    "imagine an under water `` metro city '' which is , however , only about @xmath0 m long in each direction ! in this city , there are `` highways '' and `` railroad '' tracks on which motorized `` vehicles '' transport cargo to various destinations .",
    "it has an elaborate mechanism of preserving the integrity of the chemically encoded blueprint of the construction and maintenance of the city .",
    "the `` factories '' not only supply their products for the construction and repair works , but also manufacture the components of the machines . this eco - friendly city re - charges spent `` chemical fuel '' in uniquely designed `` power plants '' .",
    "this city also uses a few `` alternative energy '' sources in some operations . finally , it has special `` waste - disposal plants '' which degrade waste into products that are recycled as raw materials for fresh synthesis .",
    "all the automated processes in this high - tech micro - city are run by _ nano - machines _ @xcite .",
    "this is not the plot of a science fiction , but a dramatized picture of the dynamic interior of a cell .",
    "a molecular machine is either a single protein or a macromolecular complex consisting of proteins and rna molecules @xcite . just like their macroscopic counterparts ,",
    "these nano - machines take an input ( most often , chemical energy ) and it transduces input energy into an output .",
    "if the output is mechanical work the machine is usually referred to as a molecular motor @xcite .",
    "similarly , a cell can also be regarded as a micron - size `` energy transforming device '' .",
    "the concept of `` machine '' is not restricted only to subcellular or cellular levels of biological organization .",
    "in ancient times , philosophers proposed the concept of `` living machine '' to describe a whole animal , including a man ; we ll discuss the evolution of this concept towards the end of this article .",
    "not only animals , but even plants also move in response to external stimuli @xcite and movements take place in plants at all levels- from whole plant and plant cell to the subcellular level .",
    "i can not resist the temptation of quoting thomas huxley s poetic description of cytoplasmic streaming @xcite , in particular , and of intracellular motor traffic , in general , in plants @xcite : `` _ .. the wonderful noonday silence of a tropical forest is , after all , due only to the dulness of our hearing ; and could our ears catch the murmur of these tiny maelstroms , as they whirl in the innumerable myriads of living cells which constitute each tree , we should be stunned , as with the roar of a great city _ '' .    in this article , however , we focus attention almost exclusively on molecular machines that drive subcellular processes within living cells .",
    "the processes driven by molecular machines include not only intracellular motor transport , but also manipulation , polymerization and degradation of the bio - molecules @xcite .",
    "explaining the physical principles that govern these machine - driven processes will bring us closer to the ultimate goal of biological physics : understanding `` what is life '' in terms of the laws of physics ( and chemistry ) .",
    "biomolecular machines operate in a domain where the appropriate units of length , time , force and energy are , _ nano - meter _ , _ milli - second _ , _ pico - newton _ and @xmath1 , respectively ( @xmath2 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath3 is the absolute temperature ) .",
    "are nt the operational mechanism of molecular machines similar to their macroscopic counterparts except , perhaps , the difference of scale ?",
    "no . in spite of the striking similarities , it is the differences between molecular machines and their macroscopic counterparts that makes the studies of these systems so interesting from the perspective of physicists .",
    "this article is a brief guide for a beginner embarking on an exploration of the exciting frontier of research on molecular machines .",
    "it begins with a catalog of the known molecular machines and a list of fundamental questions on their operational mechanism that the explorer should try to address . like any travel guide , this article also cautions the explorer about the counter - intuitive phenomena that await him / her in this new territory of his / her exploration where he / she may need new sophisticated technical tools that were not needed for handling macroscopic machines . for the explorer",
    ", this article also charts a tentative road map along with a summary of the mathematical strategies that he / she might use to make progress in this frontier territory .",
    "excursions to some of the listed border areas that overlap with areas of research in other branches of science and engineering could be enjoyable and intellectually rewarding for the explorer . for any explorer , it is good to know the experience of the pioneers .",
    "the final section , on the evolution of the concept of biological machines , is likely to be enjoyed as a dessert by physicists , and as a fresh food for thought by historians and philosophers of science .",
    "based on the mode of operation , the biomolecular machines can be divided broadly into two groups . _ cyclic machines _ operate in repetitive cycles in a manner that is very similar to that of the cyclic engines which run our cars . in contrast , some other molecular machines are _ one - shot _ machines that exhaust an internal source of free energy in a single round . force exerted by a compressed spring , upon its release , is a typical example of a one - shot machine .",
    "the most common way of supplying energy to a natural nanomachine is to utilize the chemical energy ( or , more appropriately , free energy ) released by a chemical reaction .",
    "most of the machines use the so - called high - energy compounds- particularly , nucleoside triphosphates ( ntps)- as an energy source to generate the mechanical energy required for their directed movement .",
    "the most common chemical reaction is the _ hydrolysis _ of atp ( adp ) : @xmath4 .",
    "some other high - energy compounds can also supply input energy ; one typical example being the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) to guanosine diphosphate ( gdp ) . under normal physiological conditions , hydrolysis of atp is extremely slow .",
    "most of the molecular motors fuelled by atp function also as atpase enzyme ( i.e. , catalyzes hydrolysis of atp ) thereby speeding up the energy - supplying reaction by several orders of magnitude .",
    "if a cyclic machine runs on a specific chemical fuel then the spent fuel must be removed as waste products and fresh fuel must be supplied to the machine .",
    "fortunately , normal cells have machineries for recycling waste products to manufacture fresh fuel , e.g. , synthesizing atp from adp .",
    "this raises an important question : since atp is a higher - energy compound than adp , how are the atp - synthesizing machines driven to perform this energetically `` uphill '' task ?",
    "fortunately , chemical fuel is not the only means by which input energy can be supplied to intracellular molecular machines .",
    "a cell gets its energy from external sources .",
    "it has special machines to convert the input energy into some `` energy currency '' .",
    "for example , chemical energy supplied by the food we consume is converted into an electro - chemical potential @xmath5 that not only can be used to synthesize atp , but can also directly run some other machines . in plants",
    "similar proton - motive forces are generated by machines which are driven by the input sunlight . only hydrogen ion ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "i.e. , a proton , and sodium ion ( @xmath7 ) are used in the kingdom of life to create the electro - chemical potentials , i.e. , it used either a proton - motive force ( pmf ) or a sodium - motive force ( smf ) as an energy currency .",
    "the advantages of using light , instead of chemical reaction , as the input energy for a molecular motor are as follows : ( i ) light can be switched on and off easily and rapidly , ( ii ) usually , no waste product , which would require disposal or recycling , is generated .",
    "thus , study of molecular machines deals with two complementary aspects of bioenergetics : ( a ) conversion of energy input from the external sources into the energy currency of the cell , and ( b ) conversion of the energy currency to drive various active other active processes .",
    "the cytoskeleton of a cell is the analogue of the human skeleton @xcite .",
    "however , it not only provides mechanical strength to the cell , but its filamentous proteins also form the networks of `` highways '' ( or , `` tracks '' ) on which cytoskeletal motor proteins @xcite can move .",
    "filamentous actin ( f - actin ) and microtubules ( mt ) which serve as tracks are `` polar '' in the sense that the structure and kinetics of the two ends of each filament are dissimilar",
    ".    .superfamilies of motor proteins and the corresponding tracks . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in an eukaryotic cell dna is packaged in a hierarchical structure called _",
    "chromatin_. in order to use a single strand of the dna as a template for transcription or replication , it has to be unpackaged either locally or globally .",
    "atp - dependent chromatin remodelers @xcite are motors that perform this unpackaging .",
    "however , only one of the strands of the unpackaged duplex dna serves as a template ; the duplex dna is _ unzipped _ by a dna helicase @xcite .",
    "similarly , a rna helicase unwinds a rna secondary structure . during dna replication ,",
    "a helicase moves ahead of the polymerase , like a mine sweeper , unzipping the duplex dna and dislodging other dna - bound proteins .",
    "however , the transcriptional and translational machineries do not need assistance of any helicase because these are capable of unzipping dna and unwinding rna , respectively , on their own",
    ". a helicase can be monomeric , or dimeric or hexameric .",
    "rotary molecular motors are , at least superficially , very similar to the motor of a hair dryer .",
    "two rotary motors have been studied most extensively .",
    "( i ) a rotary motor embedded in the membrane of bacteria drive the bacterial flagella @xcite which , the bacteria use for their swimming in aqueous media .",
    "( ii ) a rotary motor , called atp synthase @xcite , is embedded on the membrane of mitochondria , the powerhouses of a cell .",
    "a * synthase * drives a chemical reaction , typically the synthesis of some product ; the atp synthase produces atp , the `` energy currency '' of the cell , from adp .",
    "one can define _ processivity _ of a motor in three different ways : + ( i ) average number of _ chemical cycles _ in between attachment and the next detachment from the track ; + ( ii ) _ mean time _ of a single run , i.e. , in between an attachment and the next detachment of the motor from the track ; + ( iii ) _",
    "mean distance _ spanned by the motor on the track in a single run .",
    "+ since the definitions ( ii ) and ( iii ) are directly accessible to experiments , these are more useful than the definition ( i ) .",
    "another related , but distinct , concept is that of _ duty ratio _ which is defined as the average fraction of the time that each head spends remaining attached to its track during one cycle .    to translocate processively , a motor may utilize one of the three following strategies : + _ strategy i _ : the motor may have more than one track - binding domain ( oligomeric structure can give rise to such a possibility quite naturally ) .",
    "most of the cytoskeletal motors like conventional two - headed kinesin use such a strategy @xcite .",
    "one of the track - binding sites remains bound to the track while the other searches for its next binding site .",
    "+ _ strategy ii _ : a motor may possess non - motor extra domains or some accessory protein(s ) bound to it which can interact with the track even when none of the motor domains of the motor is attached to the track .",
    "dynein seems to exploit dynactin @xcite to enhance its own processivity .",
    "+ _ strategy iii _ : it can use a `` clamp - like '' device to remain attached to the track ; opening of the clamp will be required before the motor detaches from the track .",
    "for example , dddp utilizes this strategy @xcite .    an external force directed opposite to the natural direction of walk of a motor",
    "is called a _ load _ force .",
    "average velocity of a motor decreases with increasing load force .",
    "the magnitude of the load force at which the average velocity of the motor vanishes , is called the _",
    "stall force_. the _ force - velocity relation _ is one of the most fundamental characteristic properties of a motor .",
    "its status in biophysics is comparable , for example , to that of the i - v characteristics of a device in semiconductor physics .",
    "two motors with identical average velocities may exhibits widely different types of fluctuations .",
    "therefore , as we ll show in detail , a deeper understanding of the operational mechanism of a motor can be gained from the distributions of their `` dwells '' at the successive spatial positions on the track .",
    "\\(i ) _ single - molecule mechanism _",
    "@xcite : how do the interactions among the component structural units of an individual motor , motor - track interactions , motor - ligand ( fuel ) interactions and the mechano - chemical kinetics of the system determine , for example , ( a ) the directionality , ( b ) processivity , ( c ) dwell - time distribution , ( d ) force - velocity relation , and ( e ) efficiency of transduction ?",
    "does a given dimeric motor walk hand - over - hand or crawl like an inchworm , and why ? do the atpase domains of a hexameric motor `` fire '' ( a ) in series , or ( b ) in parallel , or , ( c ) in random sequence ?",
    "\\(ii ) _ multi - motor coordination in a `` workshop '' _ : the motors do not work in isolation _ in - vivo_. what are the mechanisms and consequences of the spatio - temporal coordination of the motors ?",
    "for example , a single mitotic spindle consists of many polymerizing and depolymerizing mts , several types of cytoskeletal motors , including depolymerases @xcite .",
    "a replisome , the workshop for dna replication , has to coordinate the operations of clamps and clamp loaders with those of primases , polymerases , etc .",
    "@xcite . similarly , a ribosome is a mobile platform on which the operations of several devices have to be coordinated properly during protein synthesis @xcite .",
    "well known co - directional as well as head - on collisions of polymerases and those of ribosomes can create traffic jam under some circumstances whereas a collision can restart stalled traffic in other circumstances @xcite .",
    "force is one of the most fundamental quantities in physics .",
    "as we ll argue in this section , some of the forces which dominate the dynamics of molecular machines have negligible effect on macroscopic machines .      for simplicity ,",
    "let us first consider a hypothetical scenario where neither the tracks nor the fuel molecules are present in the aqueous medium in which there is a free ( i.e. , not bound to any other molecule ) motor protein .",
    "suppose the medium consists of only @xmath8 `` particle - like '' molecules and the center of mass of the motor protein is also represented by a `` particle '' .",
    "then , the exact trajectories of all these @xmath9 `` particles '' can be obtained by solving the corresponding coupled _",
    "newton s _ equations that describe the dynamics of the @xmath9 particles . in reality",
    ", this approach is impractical because , even with the largest and fastest computers available at present , we can not get the trajectories over time intervals of the order of @xmath10s which is relevant for majority of the motor proteins as long as @xmath8 is large ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "a more pragmatic approach would be to solve only the equations of motion for the motor protein by treating the @xmath8 particles of the medium as merely the constituents of a reservoir .",
    "in other words , one monitors the motion in a 6-dimensional subspace of the full @xmath12-dimensional phase space of the system .",
    "the price one has to pay for this simplification is that instead of the original newton s equation for the motor protein , one has to now solve a _ langevin equation _ that describes the `` brownian '' motion of the motor protein .",
    "since we are soon going to extend the discussion in the presence of filamentous tracks which are essentially one - dimensional , we write the langevin equation for the `` brownian '' motion of the motor protein in one - dimension @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of the protein , @xmath15 is the viscous drag and and @xmath16 is the random brownian force . note that the langevin equation is neither deterministic nor symmetric under time - reversal ( @xmath17 ) .      using the stokes formula @xmath18 for a globular protein of radius @xmath19 moving with an average velocity @xmath20 ( corresponding to @xmath21 ) in the aqueous medium of viscosity",
    "@xmath22 we get an estimate @xmath23 . surprisingly , this viscous drag force is about @xmath24 times larger than the elastic force it experiences when stretched by @xmath25 !",
    "consequently , the _ reynold s number _ , which is the ratio of the inertial and viscous forces , is at most of the order @xmath26 .",
    "the reynold s number will be of the order of @xmath27 if you ever try ( not recommended ) to swim in honey !",
    "now let us supply the tracks and fuel molecules to the motor protein in the same medium .",
    "the langevin equation will now include additional terms @xmath28 which represents the net force arising from the interaction of the motor protein with its track and the ligand ; the ligand could be the fuel molecule or the molecules produced by its `` burning '' ( e.g. , atp or adp ) . besides , since the dynamics of motor proteins is expected to be dominated by hydrodynamics at low reynold s number @xcite , one generally drops the inertial term . in this `` overdamped '' regime @xmath29",
    "the energy released by the hydrolysis of a single atp molecule is about @xmath30 .",
    "interestingly , the mean thermal energy @xmath1 associated with a molecule at a temperature of the order of @xmath31 , is also @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , equating this thermal energy with the work done by the thermal force @xmath33 in causing a displacement of @xmath25 we get @xmath34 .",
    "this is comparable to the elastic force experienced by a typical motor protein when stretched by @xmath10 nm .",
    "thus , a motor protein that gets bombarded from all sides by random thermal forces is similar to a tiny creature is a very strong hurricane !",
    "therefore , in contrast to the deterministic dynamics of the macroscopic machines , the dynamics of molecular motors is stochastic ( i.e. , probabilistic ) .    already in the first half of the twentieth century darcy thompson , father of modern bio - mechanics , realized the importance of _ viscous drag _ and",
    "_ brownian forces _ at the cellular ( and subcellular ) level .",
    "he pointed out that @xcite that in this microscopic world `` _ gravitation is forgotten , and the viscosity of the liquid , ... , the molecular shocks of the brownian movement , .... the electric charges of the ionized medium , make up the physical environment ... predominant factors are no longer those of our scale _ '' .",
    "molecular motors generate force by transducing energy .",
    "interestingly , one of the two mechanisms of energy transduction that i describe here , does not have any analogous macroscopic counterpart .",
    "i explain in considerable detail why thermodynamic formalisms , which have been successfully utilized to calculate the common performance characteristics of macroscopic machines , are inadequate for natural nano - machines .",
    "molecular motors are made of _ soft matter _ whereas macroscopic motors are normally made of hard matter to withstand wear and tear .",
    "nature seems to exploit the high deformability of molecular motors for its biological function .",
    "but , this difference is minor compared to the others and will not be elaborated further here .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the macroscopic thermal engines which require at least two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures and which convert part of the input heat energy into mechanical work .",
    "why ca nt a molecular machine work as a heat engine ? in order to examine the viability of a intracellular heat engine ,",
    "let us create a temperature gradient on a length scale @xmath35 nm .",
    "an elementary analysis of heat diffusion equation is adequate to show that a temperature gradient on a length scale @xmath36 relaxes within a time interval @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the specific heat per unit volume and @xmath39 is the thermal conductivity . using the typical characteristic values of @xmath40 and @xmath39 for water",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath41s .",
    "thus , temperature gradients can not be maintained for the entire duration of even one single cycle of a cyclic molecular machine which is , typically , few orders of magnitude longer than @xmath42 . in other words , for all practical purposes , natural nano - machines operate _ isothermally_. because of the condition @xmath43 , the molecular machines operate as _ free energy transducers_.      a majority of the molecular motors are chemo - mechanical machines for which input and output are chemical energy and mechanical work , respectively .",
    "recall that for carnot s thermo - mechanical machine , the thermodynamic efficiency is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the temperatures of the two reservoirs at high and low temperatures , respectively .",
    "similarly , for an isothermal chemo - mechanical engine , the thermal reservoirs would be replaced by chemical reservoirs at fixed chemical potentials @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "consequently , the heat flow of the thermal engine would be replaced by particle flow in the chemical engine . just as the difference of heat input and output in the heat engine is converted to mechanical work , the difference @xmath50 would be converted into output work in the chemical engine . obviously , the corresponding thermodynamic efficiency would be @xcite @xmath51 .",
    "note that , because of the quasi - static nature of each step in the equilibrium thermodynamic theory of these cyclic engines , each cycle takes infinite time . naturally , the power output @xmath52 for both the thermal and chemical carnot engines .",
    "can we apply the theory of such isothermal carnot engines to a chemo - mechanical molecular machine by identifying , for example , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) as the chemical potentials of atp and adp , respectively ?",
    "the answer is : no .",
    "the cycle time of the real molecular machines is _",
    "finite _ and their power output is non - zero .",
    "moreover , motors are examples of open systems @xcite which continue to run in repetitive cycles as long as energy is pumped in .",
    "such a system can not be in thermodynamics equilibrium .      for macroscopic engines with _",
    "finite cycle time _",
    ", the characteristics of performance are often reliably calculated within the theoretical framework of endo - reversible thermodynamics @xcite . in this case",
    ", the ratio of the _ rates _ of output and input energies defines the efficiency of transduction .",
    "the rate of output work is called power output of the engine .    the formalism of endo - reversible thermodyamics for _ heat _ engines is based on the _ assumption _ that the working substance of the engine is coupled to the two _ thermal _ reservoirs by heat conductors of _ finite _ thermal conductivity ( non - zero thermal resistance ) .",
    "entire dissipation is assumed to take place in the irreversible process of heat conduction through these thermal resistors whereas all the processes in the working material of the engine are assumed to be fully reversible ( i.e. , no entropy is generated internally ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the corresponding thermal conductances in the carnot engine are infinite .",
    "efficiency at maximum power output @xmath53 , rather than maximum efficiency itself , is the most appropriate quantitative measure of the performance of such engines .",
    "the upper - bound of @xmath53 is given by the curzon - ahlborn expression @xcite @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , within the framework of the endoreversible thermodynamics , a phenomenological theory for _ chemical _ engines can also be formulated if the cycle time is _ finite _ @xcite .",
    "ca nt we use this approach for molecular machines which are also chemical engines with finite cycle times ?",
    "recall that endo - reversible thermodynamics is based on the assumption that dissipation takes place only in the process of transfer of matter between reservoirs and the working substance whereas processes that the working substance goes through in each cycle are perfectly reversible ( and , therefore , non - dissipative ) .",
    "this assumption is valid if the relaxations in the working substance of the engine are very rapid compared to the processes involving the coupling of the working substance with the reservoirs .",
    "the validity of this assumption requires clear separation of time scales of relaxation in the working substance and in the working substance - reservoir coupling .",
    "but , such separation of time scales does not hold in molecular machines which consist of macromolecules .",
    "in general , molecular motors operate far beyond the linear response regime and , therefore , the formalism of non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite for coupled mechano - chemical processes is not applicable .",
    "moreover , thermodynamic formalisms developed for macroscopically large systems do not account for the spontaneous fluctuations . on the other hand , because of the small size of a molecular motor and because of the low concentrations of the molecules involved in its operation , fluctuations of positions , conformations as well as the cycle times are intrinsic features of their kinetics .",
    "therefore , one has to use the more sophisticated toolbox of stochastic processes and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics for theoretical treatment of molecular machines .",
    "interestingly , as we argue below , noise need not be a nuisance for a motor ; instead , a motor can move forward by gainfully exploiting this noise !      the performance of _ macroscopic _ motors are characterized by a combination of its efficiency , power output , maximum force or torque that it can generate . just like the performance of their macroscopic counterparts with finite cycle time , that of molecular motors @xcite have also been characterized in terms of efficiency at maximum power , rather than maximum efficiency .",
    "however , the efficiency of molecular motors can be defined in several different ways @xcite .    the efficiency of a motor , with finite cycle time ,",
    "is generally defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the input and output powers , respectively . the usual definition of _ thermodynamic efficiency _",
    "@xmath58 is based on the assumption that , like its macroscopic counterpart , a molecular motor has an output power @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath28 is the externally applied opposing ( load ) force .",
    "although this definition is unambiguous , it is unsatisfactory for practical use in characterizing the performance of molecular motors .",
    "as explained earlier , a molecular motor has to work against the omnipresent viscous drag in the intracelluar medium even when no other force opposes its movement ( i.e. , even if @xmath60 ) .    a generalized efficiency @xmath61 is also represented by the same expression ( [ eq - eff ] ) where , instead of ( [ eq - thermoout ] ) , the output power is assumed to be @xcite @xmath62 this definition treats the load force and viscous drag on equal footing .",
    "in contrast , the `` stokes efficiency '' @xmath63 for a molecular motor driven by a chemical reaction is defined as @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average rate of the chemical reaction and @xmath66 is the chemical free energy consumed in each reaction cycle .",
    "this efficiency is named after stokes because the viscous drag is calculated from stokes law .",
    "as we show in the next subsection , the directional movement of some motors arises from the rectification of random thermal noise . for such motors ,",
    "an alternative measure of performance is the _",
    "rectification efficiency _ @xcite .",
    "thus , different definitions of the efficiency of a molecular motor may arise from different interpretations of their tasks or may characterize distinct aspects of their operation .",
    "nevertheless , for any definition of efficiency , it is essential to ensure that its allowed values lie between @xmath67 and @xmath10 .      if the input energy directly causes a conformational change of the protein machinery which manifests itself as a mechanical stroke of the motor , the operation of the motor is said to be driven by a `` power stroke '' mechanism .",
    "this is also the mechanism used by all man made macroscopic machines .",
    "however , in case of molecular motors , the power stroke is always `` noisy '' because of the brownian forces acting on it .",
    "let us contrast this with the following alternative scenario : suppose , the machine exhibits both `` forward '' and `` backward '' movements because of spontaneous thermal fluctuations . if now energy input is utilized to prevent `` backward '' movements , but allow the `` forward '' movements , the system will exhibit directed , albeit noisy , movement in the `` forward '' direction .",
    "note that the forward movements in this case are caused directly by the spontaneous thermal fluctuations , the input energy rectifies the `` backward '' movements .",
    "this alternative scenario is called the brownian ratchet mechanism @xcite .",
    "the concept of brownian ratchet @xcite was popularized by richard feynman with his ratchet - and - pawl device @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of molecular motors , the brownin ratchet mechanism was proposed by several groups in the 1990s @xcite .",
    "thus , in principle , there are two idealized scenarios for a transition from a conformation a to a conformation b- one is by a pure power stroke and the other by a purely brownian ratchet mechanism @xcite . however , for a real molecular motor , it is difficult to unambiguously distinguish between a power stroke and a brownian ratchet @xcite ; the actual mechanism may be a combination of the two idealized extremes .",
    "@xmath68*are brownian motors maxwell s demon ? * brownian ratchet mechanism transduces random thermal energy of the reservoir into mechanical work .",
    "does it imply that these motors are perpetual motors of the second kind that violate the second law of thermodynamics ?",
    "in that case , does it have any similarity with the maxwell s demon @xcite ?",
    "a short answer is : no , a brownian ratchet is not a maxwell s demon because it is an open system far from the state of equilibrium whereas the second law of thermodynamics is strictly valid only for systems in stable thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "is there any real biomolecular motor which can be regarded as a true physical realization of brownian ratchets ?",
    "the answer is an emphatic `` yes '' and we list a few typical examples here .",
    "kif1a , a single - headed kinesin , is an example of cytoskeletal motor whose operational mechanism can be interpreted as a brownian ratchet @xcite . the original acto - myosin crossbridge model suggested by huxley @xcite can be interpreted as brownian ratchet @xcite although huxley himself did not use this terminology .",
    "brownian ratchet can also account for the force generation by a polymerizing cytoskeletal filament @xcite .",
    "the crossing of a membrane during the export / import of a protein of length @xmath69 ( amino acid monomers ) takes place at a faster rate by the brownian ratchet mechanism compared to that by pure translational diffusion @xcite .",
    "it has been claimed that the translocation of a mrna molecule across the nuclear membrane of an eukaryotic cell takes place also by a similar brownian ratchet mechanism through the nuclear pore complex @xcite .",
    "the elongation of a mrna during transcription by a rna polymerase can also be a physical realization of the brownian ratchet mechanism @xcite .",
    "translocation , one of the crucial steps of the mechano - chemical cycle of a ribosome is a physical realization of brownian ratchet @xcite .",
    "we combine the fundamental principles of ( stochastic ) nano - mechanics and ( stochastic ) chemical kinetics to formulate the general theoretical framework for a quantitative description of the _ mechano - chemistry _ or _ chemo - mechanics _ of molecular motors .",
    "we mention a few alternative formalisms .",
    "this approach is useful for an intuitive physical explanation of the coupled mechano - chemical kinetics of molecular motors .",
    "at least one of the independent coordinate axes of this landscape represents the position of the motor in real space ( i.e. , its `` mechanical coordinate '' ) while at least another represents its chemical state ( .e .",
    ", `` chemical coordinate '' ) .",
    "therefore , the minimum dimension of this `` land '' is @xmath70 and the free energy can be represented by the hight at each point on the `` land '' .",
    "both the position and chemical state variables are assumed to be continuous .",

    "`` the story of the living machine '' @xcite narrated by herbert william conn , one of the founding members and the third president of the society of americam bacteriologists ( renamed , in 1960 , american society for microbiology ) , is a critical overview of the understanding of these machines at the end of the nineteenth century . because of his deep understanding of the basic principles of physical sciences as well as evolutionary biology , his narrative on the fundamental principles of living machines remains as contemporary today as it was at the time of its publication .",
    "conn asked whether the operations of individual organisms , i.e. , the living machines , could be `` reduced to the action of still smaller machines '' @xcite .",
    "conn argued that one can look upon each constituent cell of an organism also `` a little engine with admirably adapted parts '' @xcite .",
    "his summary @xcite that a living organism is a `` series of machines one within the other '' sounds very similar to leibnitz s philosophical idea .",
    "conn went even further : `` as a whole it is machine , and its parts are separate machines .",
    "each part is further made up of still smaller machines until we reach the realm of the microscope . here",
    "still we find the same story .",
    "even the parts formerly called units , prove to be machines '' .",
    "he speculated @xcite `` we may find still further machines within '' cells .",
    "he ended his summary with the statement `` and thus vital activity is reduced to a complex of machines , all acting in harmony with each other to produce together the one result- life '' @xcite .",
    "conn @xcite not only discussed `` the running of the living machine '' , but also `` the origin of the living machine '' . in the latter context , while pointing out the differences in the principles of engineering design of man - made machines and evolutionary principles of nature s nano - machines , he wrote @xcite : `` it is something as if steam engine of watt should be slowly changed by adding piece after piece until there was finally produced the modern quadruple expansion engine , but all this change being made upon the original engine without once stopping its motion . ''",
    "jaques loeb , a famous embryologist , delivered a series of eight lectures at the columbia university in 1902 ( see ref.@xcite for a more complete published version ) .",
    "in the first lecture , loeb started by saying `` in these lectures we shall consider living organisms as chemical machines , consisting essentially of colloidal material , which possess the peculiarities of automatically developing , preserving , and reproducing themselves '' @xcite .",
    "he emphasized the crucial differences between natural and artificial machines by the following statement : `` the fact that the machines which can be created by man do not possess the power of automatic development , self - preservation , and reproduction constitutes for the pesent a fundamental difference between living machines and artificial machines '' .",
    "however , just like some of his other visionary predecessors , he also admitted that `` nothing contradicts the possibility that the artificial production of living matter may one day be accomplished '' @xcite .",
    "the concept of `` living machine '' as a `` transformer of energy '' , from the level of a single cell to the level of a multi - cellular organism as complex as a man , found mention in many lectures and books of the leading biologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieh centuries ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "research on molecular machines was focussed almost exclusively on the mechanism of muscle contraction during the first half of the 20th century and it was dominated by archibald hill and otto meyerhof @xcite who shared the nobel prize in physiology ( or medicine ) in 1922 .    by mid - twentieth century , physical sciences already witnessed spectacular progress and life sciences was just embarking on its golden period . in his guthrie lecture (",
    "also titled `` the physical basis of life '' ) , delivered on 21st november , 1947 ( see ref.@xcite for the full text ) , j. d. bernal drew attention of the audience to the structure and dynamics of machines .",
    "ten years later , in a review article , the title of which again had the words `` physical basis of life '' , schmitt @xcite made even more concrete references to molecular machines covering almost all the types of machines that we have sketched in this article .",
    "the concept of molecular machines @xcite was mentioned on many occasions in the late twentieth century by leading molecular biologists who made outstanding contributions in elucitaing their mechanisms of operation .",
    "the strongest impact was made , however , by the influential paper of bruce alberts @xcite , then the president of the national academy of sciencs ( usa ) .",
    "he wrote that `` _ the entire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines , each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines _ '' @xcite .",
    "why did i start my story with aristotle ? in darcy",
    "thompson s words @xcite `` we know that the history of biology harks back to aristotle by a road that is straight and clear , but that beyond him the road is broken and the lights are dim '' .",
    "moreover , a section of the modern enterprise in animal sciences is pursuing important investigations on the efficiency of energy utilization by animals @xcite treating an entire animal as an a `` combustion engine '' , a modern and scientifically correct version of the original philosophical idea developed by aristotle and propagated by his followers .",
    "why am i closing my story with alberts ?",
    "because of a fortutious coincidence , alberts vision for training the next generation of biologists for studying natural nano - machines coincided with the explosive beginning of nano - technology that includes research programs on artificial nano - machines .",
    "alberts article @xcite was appeared at a time when the statistical physics of brownian ratchets was getting lot of attention @xcite .",
    "the concept of molecular machine has matured fully into an area of interdisciplinary research in the twenty - first century .",
    "a new exciting era of research has just begun !",
    "so far as the current status of our understanding is concerned , i would say that till the middle of the 20th century we had never seen or manipulated a single molecular machine although machine - like operation of a cell or an entire organism was fairly well established . in the last 60 years",
    "this area has seen explosive growth in activity .",
    "the structures as well as the mechanisms of many machines no longer appear any more mysterious than those of macroscopic machines .",
    "it is practically impossible to predict new ideas in any field of research ; molecular machines are no exception .",
    "the reason , as peter medawar @xcite admitted in his presidential address at the cambridge meeting of the british association for the advancement of science , is as follows : `` to predict an idea is to have an idea , and if we have an idea it can no longer be the subject of prediction '' .",
    "therefore , in this section , i do not propose any new idea but merely mention a few systems and phenomena which need new ideas for their studies and understanding .",
    "let me begin with solving the forward problem with process modeling .",
    "here we need new ideas to make progress in two opposite directions : ( a ) _ in - silico _ modeling of single individual machines in terms of its coordinating parts in an aqueous medium- aquatic nano - robotics ; ( b ) integration of nano - machines and machine - assemblies into a micro - factory , the living cell .",
    "so far as the point ( a ) is concerned , serious efforts have been made by developing coarse - grained computational models @xcite that can be regarded as the substitutes for full molecular dynamics based models .",
    "however , a technical ( or algorithmic ) breakthrough is needed to achieve the ultimate goal of `` seeing '' the operation of a machine in its natural aqueous environment by carrying out an experiments _ in - silico_.    next let me explain the aim of developing _ integrated _ models .",
    "it has been strongly argued at the dawn of this millenium @xcite that the machinery of life is _ modular_. the machineries of transcription , translation , replication , chromosome segregation , etc .",
    "are all examples of modules which perform specific tasks .",
    "the components of some of these modules are parts of a single machine , e.g. , all devices participating in translation function on a single platform provided by a ribosome .",
    "signal transduction machinery is an extreme example of the other types of functional modules which are spatially distributed over a significantly large region of intracellular space without need for direct physical contacts among the parts .",
    "the machines that we have considered here are all more or less spatially - confined functional modules",
    ". normally , functional modules are not completely isolated and must communicate and coordinate their function with other modules .",
    "for example , dna replication and chromosome segregation machineries require proper coordination . to my knowledge , no attempt has been made so far for quantitative stochastic _",
    "process modeling _ incorporating more than one functional module in a seamless fashion .",
    "such an enterprise may look like what is now the happening in systems biology : to integrate the operations of machineries for different functional modules within a single theoretical framework .",
    "finally , let me point out some of the standard practices of statistical inference that , to my knowledge , have not been followed so far while reverse - engineering molecular machines .",
    "the experimental data for molecular machines have been analyzed by several groups to extract an underlying kinetic model .",
    "however , most often the analysis carried out during such _ reverse engineering _ is based on a single working hypothesis .",
    "it would be desirable to follow platt s @xcite principle of `` strong inference '' which is an extension of chamberlin s @xcite `` method of multiple working hypothesis '' . by multiple model",
    "i do not mean models hierarchically nested such that each one is a special case of the model at the next level . by the term multiple model ,",
    "i mean truly competing models that may , however , overlap partially .",
    "the relative scores of the competing models ( and the corresponding underlying hypothese ) would be a true reflection of their merits .",
    "for example , in case of a closely related systems in cell biology and systems biology , experimental data have been analyzed recently within the framework of this method @xcite . in the case of molecular machines ,",
    "a method for model selection has been developed @xcite ; it extracts the best model by optimizing the maximum _ evidence _ , rather than maximum likelihood , that treats , for example , the number of discrete states of the system as a variational parameter .",
    "this is a step in the right direction .",
    "however , i am not aware of any work that ranks alternative models according to relative scores computed on the basis of the principle of strong inference .",
    "the molecular mechanism of muscle myosin and the structure of double - stranded dna were both discovered in the 1950s .",
    "these discoveries set the stage for the research on cytoskeletal motors as well as on machines that make , break and manipulate nucleic acids and proteins .",
    "last 50 years has seen enormous progress .",
    "i wanted to tell you about the pis and their contributions during this glorious period .",
    "but , i have run out of space .",
    "so , i ll narrate this fascinating story in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "* acknowledgements * : i apologize to all those researchers whose work , although no less important , could not be included in this article because of space limitations .",
    "i thank all my students and colleagues with whom i have collaborated on molecular machines .",
    "i am also indebted to many others ( too many to be listed by name ) for enlightening discussions and correspondences over the last few years .",
