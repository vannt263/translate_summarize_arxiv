    "recently , considerable progress has been made in the experimental and theoretical study of single quantum systems in atomic traps and optical cavities as well as in the context of solid - state physics ( coupled quantum dots ) . in many cases",
    "the physical situation may be described by means of a two level system with states @xmath2 and @xmath3 under the influence of a periodic driving potential @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting motion of the normalized state @xmath5 involves oscillations of the probabilities @xmath6 and @xmath1 called rabi oscillations .",
    "the usual way to measure the dynamics of @xmath1 employs many projection measurements of an observable with eigenstates @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for this purpose",
    "an ensemble is prepared in the initial state and a projection measurement is carried out at time @xmath7 on each member of the ensemble leading to the determination of @xmath8 . repeating the procedure for different times",
    "@xmath9 one obtains the rabi oscillations of @xmath1 .",
    "this procedure fails if there is only one single quantum system available and the objective is to visualize its motion in real time .",
    "imagine , e.g. , there is a single two - level system performing only once a hundred rabi oscillations .",
    "is there a method to visualize them ?",
    "there are two complementary conditions such a method must meet .",
    "the measurement must not disturb the system too much , so that its evolution remains close to the undisturbed case . on the other hand",
    ", the coupling of the measurement apparatus to the two level system should nevertheless be so strong that the readout shows accurately enough the modified dynamics of the system ( including the disturbance by the measurement ) .",
    "this can clearly not be achieved by standard measurements which project onto an eigenstate of the measured observable .",
    "they disturb the system too strongly .",
    "for instance , the well known quantum zeno effect shows that it is possible to detect perfectly the modified dynamics of a system at the price of loosing all information about the undisturbed motion .",
    "the measurement disturbs the dynamics so much as to make the system stay in one of the eigenstates of the observable .",
    "a more promising strategy to fulfill our demands is to carry out appropriate sequences of generalized measurements .",
    "generalized measurements differ from projection measurements in that the probabilities of their outcomes are in general given by the expectation values of positive operators instead of projection operators .    the theory of generalized measurements in which observables are represented by positive operator valued measures ( povm ) has intensively been studied @xcite . for",
    "a survey see busch et al .",
    "these measurements are in their generic form also called unsharp , as we will do , or non - ideal , weak , soft or fuzzy , thereby paying attention to one of their different properties . they have been investigated theoretically in connection with the problem of joint non - ideal measurements of incompatible observables , c.f .",
    ", busch et al .",
    "recent quantum optical measurements like the haroche - ramsey set - up have been analyzed too with respect to the question of complementarity by de muynck and hendrikx @xcite using the concept of generalized measurements .",
    "martens and de muynck @xcite address the question of which measurements extract the most information about the system .",
    "information extraction and disturbance has been widely discussed in quantum information theory , as e.g. , in the context of continuous measurement and feedback control by doherty et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "we will deal instead with sequences of discrete unsharp measurements which are separated in time and show that , if appropriately chosen , they may provide a real time visualization of rabi oscillations .    in the context of continuous quantum measurements of energy",
    "the question of visualization of oscillations has been addressed in @xcite in a phenomenological approach , which was based on the application of restricted path integrals @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it had been indicated , that for continuous measurements a correlation may exist between the time - dependent measurement readout and modified rabi oscillations between energy eigenstates .",
    "this visualization of a state evolution has been numerically verified in @xcite , to our best knowledge for the first time ( compare also @xcite ) .",
    "oscillations in coupled quantum dots measured by a quantum point contact are treated in an approach to continuous quantum measurements using stochastic master equations by korotkov @xcite . for a quantum trajectory approach see goan et al .",
    "@xcite .    a realization scheme for the continuous fuzzy measurement of energy and the monitoring of a quantum transition",
    "has then been given in @xcite .",
    "the intention was to present a microphysical basis for the phenomenologically motivated continuous measurement scheme .",
    "inspired by this article we give below an independent treatment which is solely based on successive single - shot measurements of the generalized type ( povm ) . all concepts necessary to introduce an appropriate measurement readout , to justify this choice and to specify different measurement regimes are based on these single measurements .",
    "this is also the case for the numerical evaluation which makes use of the simulation of single unsharp measurements and the otherwise undisturbed dynamical evolution ( rabi oscillations ) between the measurements .",
    "our intention is to keep our treatment as general as possible but nevertheless readable for those who may be able to design experimental realizations .",
    "we will give an application to a particular quantum optical setup in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ 2 ] we specify the particular subclass of unsharp measurements on which our considerations are based . in sect .  [ 3 ] a succession of these unsharp measurements is studied .",
    "in addition we introduce the concept of a best guess based on the outcome of one series of @xmath10 consecutive measurements ( n - series ) . in sect .  [",
    "4 ] a hamiltonian is introduced generating the rabi oscillations we want to measure by means of series of unsharp measurements with time @xmath11 between two consecutive measurements . an appropriate measurement readout is defined and different regimes of measurement are specified .",
    "finally the results of the numerical analysis ( specified in app .",
    "c ) are presented in sect .",
    "[ 5 ] . in order not to interrupt the flux of the presentation we postponed the detailed motivation of the particular choice of generalized measurements to app .",
    "a and some technical considerations concerning the measurement readout to app .",
    "for later use we introduce in this section a well known special class of generalized measurements and discuss how they may be experimentally realized .",
    "we discuss measurements on a _ two - level system _",
    "( s ) with orthonormed states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are eigenstates of an observable @xmath12 represented by a self - adjoint operator .",
    "this observable may be for example energy or spin .",
    "we perform a particular kind of generalized measurement , that is a measurement which can be represented by means of a _ positive operator valued measure _ ( povm ) .",
    "its operational meaning will become clearer in subsection [ 2.2 ] , where we describe its realization .",
    "the measurement is specified as follows : there are only two _ outcomes _ or pointer readings denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the duration of the measurement is @xmath15 .",
    "depending on the outcome the normalized initial state @xmath16 of s is tranformed due to the measurement into one of the related states @xmath17 , @xmath18 with so - called _ operations _ , which are required to be diagonal : @xmath19    we add to this first requirement an important second one : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are assumed to be positive . here and in the following an overall phase factor @xmath22",
    "is omitted without loss of generality .",
    "a justification for both requirements is given in app .",
    "a. let us introduce @xmath23 we will characterize the measurement later on by the _ parameters _",
    "@xmath24    according to the specifications above , we restrict ourselves to a particular class of _ generalized measurements _ with commuting hermitean operations , which will prove to be useful for our purpose . throughout the paper we discuss selective measurements , which are non - destructive .",
    "we use the schrdinger picture unless otherwise stated .",
    "note , that the state vectors will in general not be normalized .",
    "the probabilities @xmath25 for the outcomes @xmath13 and @xmath14 to occur if the measurement is performed on the state @xmath16 are given by the expectation value of the so - called _ effects _",
    "@xmath26 according to @xmath27 this leads to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "one may also write @xmath30 the effects @xmath31 and @xmath32 are semi - positive operators . because of the property ( [ effects2 ] ) they constitute a povm .",
    "it is a characteristic trait of the type of measurements in question that the effects are in general not projections : @xmath33 .",
    "we call this the _ genuine case_.    only in the limiting cases with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( or with indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 interchanged ) , i.e. @xmath38 , we obtain a projection operator valued measure ( pvm ) . looking at the resulting states @xmath39 in this limit we see that they are identical with @xmath2 or @xmath3 . accordingly ,",
    "if the initial state @xmath16 is @xmath3 , we obtain reliably @xmath13 as measurement outcome and @xmath14 for @xmath2 ( or with indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 interchanged ) .",
    "this well known von neumann measurement is called a _",
    "sharp measurement_.    the opposite limit is characterized by @xmath40",
    ". then @xmath41 are nearly proportional to the identity operator and the probabilities @xmath42 of the outcomes become nearly independent of the initial state @xmath16 . even if the initial state is @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) , there are finite probabilities for both outcomes @xmath13 and @xmath14 . because in the genuine case the generalized measurement does not allow a fully reliable conclusion regarding the initial state , it is called an _ unsharp ( or non - ideal ) measurement_. with @xmath43 of the form ( [ defe+ ] ) and ( [ defe- ] ) it is generally accepted to refer to it as an unsharp measurement of the observable @xmath12 @xcite . because it is not evident what this notation could mean from an operational point of view , we discuss an explicit realization below . in the limit @xmath44 ,",
    "the measurement changes the state only a little as can be seen from equations ( [ defm+ ] ) and ( [ defm- ] ) . regarding its influence on the state , an unsharp measurement",
    "may also be called _ weak _ or _ soft_. below we will make use of the fact that single measurements with different degrees of weakness may be introduced by choosing the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 appropriately .",
    "it is known that the unsharp measurements above can be realized by coupling the two - level systems s to a _ meter _",
    "m and performing a projection measurement on m only ( c.f .",
    "neumark s theorem @xcite ) .",
    "it is to be expected , that in this way experiments with unsharp measurements of the class we are discussing may in practice be performed for example in the domain of quantum optics or condensed matter physics .",
    "we give therefore some details :    the two - level system in the state @xmath47 interacts with another two - level system with orthonormed states @xmath48 which acts as the meter m. its initial state is @xmath49 .",
    "hence the initial state of the compound system is @xmath50 .",
    "it is then assumed that the interaction lasting for the time @xmath15 results in the particular unitary development @xmath51 with positive @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "after @xmath15 a sharp measurement on the meter alone is performed which , depending on the outcome @xmath13 or @xmath14 , projects on the state @xmath54 or @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "these two pointer readings @xmath13 and @xmath14 are taken as the measurement outcomes of section [ 2.1 ] .",
    "the readout @xmath13 occurs with probability @xmath57 which agrees with @xmath58 of ( [ prob ] ) . in this case",
    "the state of the compound system after the measurement is the product state @xmath59 with @xmath60 as given in equations ( [ statetrafo ] ) with ( [ defm+ ] ) and ( [ defm- ] ) .",
    "in order to obtain the final state for the measurement readout @xmath14 one simply has to interchange the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the class of unsharp measurements of section [ 2.1 ] is thus reconstructed .",
    "the device specified above shows clearly that the unsharpness in question is of genuine quantum nature .",
    "it can not be traced back to an imperfect measurement procedure , which itself may for example be caused by an imperfectly fixed pointer showing from time to time @xmath13 although the meter state is @xmath55 .",
    "the reason is instead that the quantum dynamics leading to the unitary development ( [ sysmeter ] ) does not correlate @xmath2 only with @xmath54 and @xmath3 only with @xmath55 but allows the appearance of the states @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the superposition .",
    "we will now perform on the same single system @xmath10 unsharp measurements of the type specified above with the same parameters in an immediate succession .",
    "this is called an _",
    "n - series_. later on we will allow the measurements to be separated in time by @xmath11 .",
    "a motivation to use n - series will be given below .",
    "since the operations @xmath63 and @xmath64 commute , the final state after the n - series will not depend on the order of @xmath13 and @xmath14 results .",
    "for any particular sequence of results with a total number @xmath65 of results @xmath13 the state is transformed for @xmath66 according to @xmath67 with @xmath68    now we discard the information about the order of the results , i.e. , we restrict ourselves to the information that the total number of @xmath13 results is @xmath65 , regardless when they occurred in the sequence . as measurement outcome attributed to the total n - series we take in the following the relative frequency of positive results @xmath69 in order to transcribe for this type of unsharp measurement the scheme of section [ 2.1 ] , which is based on the equations ( [ statetrafo ] ) ,",
    "( [ effects1 ] ) and ( [ prob ] ) for non - normalized state vectors , we have to work out the related operations and effects .",
    "the probability @xmath70 that @xmath65 positive results are measured in an n - series is @xmath71 times the probability that a particular ordered sequence of @xmath65 positive and @xmath72 negative results is obtained : @xmath73 where the effect @xmath74 is given by @xmath75\\nonumber\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding probability is @xmath76 to complete the scheme we write the pure state resulting after the n - series in the form @xmath77    in order to quantify by how much an n - series of measurements affects the state , we calculate for arbitrary values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 the fidelity , which shows how closely the post - measurement state resembles the pre - measurement state .",
    "the fidelity @xmath80 between the pure state @xmath16 before the measurements and the state @xmath81 after the n - series is equal to the square of root of the overlap between @xmath16 and @xmath82 @xcite @xmath83 please note , that @xmath84 is unnormalized . after some algebra one finds @xmath85 where @xmath86 equation ( [ fidelcon ] ) shows that for all choices of the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 the fidelity assumes its minimum for @xmath87 and its maximum for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( or with indices interchanged ) .",
    "fidelity may serve as a direct measure for the weakness of the influence of an n - series of weak measurements on the pre - measurement state .",
    "this becomes evident by looking at the limiting cases : for extremely sharp measurements with @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( or vice versa ) the fidelity equals the fidelity @xmath92 of a projection measurement .",
    "the maximal fidelity @xmath93 is obtained for infinitely weak measurements with @xmath94 .    for an infinite n - series the limit @xmath95 equals for all values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath96 the fidelity of an projection measurement . that such an iteration of measurements produces an eigenstate",
    "has theoretically been discussed in @xcite . for an experimental scheme which realizes a projection measurement by an iteration of unsharp measurements",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for the moment we refer again to repeated measurements on the same initial state @xmath16 ( ensemble approach ) .",
    "the statistical expectation value of @xmath97 reads @xmath98 the latter equation follows with ( [ probn ] ) . in a similar way we obtain the variance @xmath99 :    @xmath100    based on ( [ expn2 ] ) it is easy to relate @xmath101 of the initial state @xmath16 with the expectation value @xmath102 of an n - series of unsharp measurements starting with @xmath16 : latexmath:[\\[\\label{c2n }    quantities @xmath101 and",
    "@xmath102 refer to an ensemble represented by the state @xmath16 .",
    "if only one n - series is measured as will be the case below , only a _",
    "best guess _",
    "@xmath104 for the quantity @xmath101 can be obtained .",
    "equation ( [ varn ] ) suggests to choose it as @xmath105 the standard deviation of the best guess @xmath104 is then given by    @xmath106    it specifies how accurate @xmath101 of the pre - measurement state @xmath16 can be estimated by means of one n - series .",
    "@xmath107 can be decreased by increasing @xmath10 or @xmath46 .    in case of a single measurement ( @xmath108 )",
    ", the standard deviation @xmath107 assumes its minimal value @xmath109 for @xmath110 , i.e. , for a projection measurement ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 or vice versa ) .",
    "for all other choices of the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath111 ) and other choices of @xmath10 , there is a larger standard deviation .",
    "this justifies to call these measurements unsharp , because they provide less reliable information about @xmath101 .    as we will see below",
    ", there are physical situations in which the parameters are fixed and have to be chosen with @xmath112 .",
    "( [ varb2 ] ) shows that in this case the standard deviation decreases with increasing number of repetitions @xmath10 so that it is favorable to refer to n - series .",
    "this is the reason why we will now make use of them .",
    "we refer in the following not to an ensemble but to one single two - level quantum system .",
    "it is driven by an external periodical influence with frequency @xmath113 to perform resonant rabi oscillations , if it is not disturbed by measurements . in the schrdinger picture",
    "its undisturbed dynamics is therefore given by @xmath114 with @xmath115 and rabi period @xmath116 . because of the resonance we have : @xmath117 .",
    "it is our intention to visualize the undisturbed behaviour in time of @xmath1 , i.e. , in our case the rabi oscillations .",
    "a sharp measurement implies a drastic change of @xmath118 into @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "a succession of projection measurements will in fact result approximately in the zeno effect .",
    "unsharp measurements can be weak and may change the state less .",
    "if their parameters are properly adjusted , one can therefore expect that these measurements are superior for our purpose .",
    "accordingly many unsharp measurements of the type specified in sect .  [",
    "2.1 ] are performed on this system with time @xmath11 between two consecutive measurements . the unitary development between the measurements",
    "is determined by the hamiltonian @xmath119 .",
    "it is assumed that the time @xmath11 is much larger than the duration @xmath120 of a single unsharp measurement ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "again we bundle up @xmath10 unsharp measurements to an n - series of total duration @xmath122 , so that in fact a sequence of n - series is obtained with outcomes @xmath123 at @xmath124 with @xmath125 . in order to resolve the rabi oscillations we require @xmath126 .",
    "as outlined in appendix b the best guess @xmath127 related to @xmath123 by @xmath128 can still be used as approximation for @xmath129 even if a driving influence is present .",
    "however , it will only be a good approximation if the number @xmath10 of measurements within a n - series is not too large .",
    "more precisely , @xmath10 has to fulfill inequality ( [ nbound ] ) .",
    "the sequence @xmath130 obtained from the outcomes of the successive n - series serves as the _ measurement readout_.      how unsharp ( or weak ) must the underlying single measurement of section [ 2 ] for our purpose be ?",
    "a measure for the strength of the driving influence in ( [ h ] ) is given by the frequency @xmath131 .",
    "a strong influence corresponds to a short rabi period of the oscillations between the two levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the other hand measurements on the system ,",
    "even if they are unsharp , modify and hinder this primary time development of the state of the system .",
    "we have therefore two contrary influences on the two - level system . for a comparison",
    "we want to introduce a characteristic time which represents the reciprocal strength of the disturbing influence of the measurement alone . to this end",
    "we discuss in a first step again one n - series with @xmath66 .",
    "the two states @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the two - level system correspond to @xmath89 and @xmath132 . according to ( [ varb2 ] ) the standard deviation @xmath107 of the best guess @xmath104 improves with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "how large must @xmath10 be in order to obtain a standard deviation smaller than @xmath36 , so that one can discriminate between the two values of @xmath101 above ?",
    "we have to demand    @xmath133    @xmath107 depends on @xmath134 and @xmath135 of the initial state . but",
    "this requirement should be fulfilled for any initial state .",
    "we may therefore take in ( [ 1.gt.sq1 ] ) the maximum value of @xmath107 @xmath136 which amounts to @xmath137 in fact we are interested in unsharp measurements within the n - series which are repeated after a time @xmath138 . in order to discuss the influence of the measurements separately , we consider the absence of the driving influence ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "then the operator of the dynamical evolution between the measurements commute with @xmath140 . therefore independent from the initial state altogether a finite interval of time not larger than @xmath141 is needed in order to obtain a variance of the related best guess so small as to resolve the levels with high probability .",
    "we call @xmath142 the _ level resolution time_.    we return to the situation when in addition the driving external influence is active too",
    ". the complete setup is then characterized by two time scales : the level resolution time @xmath142 and the rabi period @xmath116 .",
    "there are three physically different regimes : for @xmath143 the succession of measurements is strong or sharp enough to push the state to one of the states @xmath2 or @xmath3 before the rabi oscillation becomes manifest . connected with this",
    "is a small variance .",
    "therefore @xmath127 will correspond well to the disturbed @xmath129 but the readout will not reflect the underlying rabi oscillations .",
    "we call this the _ quantum jump regime _ for reasons to be seen later . for @xmath144 on the other hand , the measurement influence on the state dynamics is so weak , that the state and therefore @xmath129 shows the rabi oscillations . but because of the large variance of @xmath104 , a single readout @xmath127 will in general not be significantly related to @xmath129 but will show a _",
    "fuzzy _ behaviour .",
    "the state motion thus can not be read off from @xmath127 .",
    "we call this the",
    "_ rabi regime_. of particular interest is the _ intermediate regime _ characterized by @xmath145 .",
    "one can expect that this regime shows two features : on one hand the state motion is still close to the rabi oscillations and on the other hand the readout @xmath127 follows closely the @xmath129 of the state . in this case",
    "the state motion would be made visible as intended , without modifying too much the original rabi oscillations by the influence of the measurement .",
    "the numerical simulations show that the intermediate regime can rather be characterized by the condition @xmath146 than by @xmath145 . in the following we use @xmath147 instead of @xmath142 as _ measure of fuzziness_.",
    "we discuss the three regimes by considering one typical example for each regime .",
    "the characteristic traits can be read off from figs .",
    "[ figure1]  [ figure3 ] . in all three cases",
    "we have chosen @xmath148 and @xmath149 , so that condition ( [ nbound ] ) is fulfilled . figs .",

    "the noise reduction is sketched in appendix c. the related figs .",
    "[ figure1]b  [ figure3]b show the respective fourier spectra gained by discrete fourier transform of the @xmath101-curve ( black ) and the measurement readout @xmath104 ( grey ) .",
    "the peaks at @xmath151 are caused by the non - vanishing average value of the curves . in the three regimes",
    "we find characteristically different results :      with fuzziness @xmath152 there is a rather strong influence of the measurements on the time evolution of the state .",
    "the single measurement is still rather sharp and close to a projection measurement .",
    "accordingly , we observe in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , that the rabi oscillations of @xmath101 , which would appear in the absence of the measurements are completely destroyed . the @xmath101-curve ( black ) shows jumps between extended periods with values approximately equal to @xmath153 or @xmath36 .",
    "this means that if the state of the system is close to an eigenstate @xmath2 or @xmath3 , it has a high probability to stay there .",
    "the @xmath104-curve of the measurement readout ( gray ) reflects very well the @xmath101-curve of the state .",
    "the peaks of the @xmath101-curve pointing upwards and downwards follow the direction of the corresponding peaks of the @xmath104-curve .",
    "the processed @xmath104-curve ( dashed ) reflects the quantum jump regime even better . in this regime",
    "there is a rather good agreement between the readout and the @xmath101-curve , but there is no characteristic indication of the undisturbed dynamics .",
    "the fourier spectra show a very good correlation , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure1]b .",
    "the other extreme can be found in the rabi regime .",
    "we have chosen a high fuzziness @xmath154 .",
    "the single measurements are so unsharp and their influence on the motion of the state so weak , that the rabi oscillations remain nearly undisturbed .",
    "this can be seen from the @xmath101-curve ( black ) in fig .",
    "[ figure2]a .",
    "in contrast to this the @xmath104-curve of the measurement readout ( grey ) is very fuzzy .",
    "the single measurement results lie far away from the interval @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "the processed @xmath104-curve ( dashed ) shows also no correlation , neither in phase nor amplitude with the @xmath101-curve . turning to the fourier spectra ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) , we see that the rabi frequency of the @xmath101-curve ( black ) is represented well . on the other hand , no frequency can be attributed to the measurement readout ( gray curve ) . in this regime",
    "the measurement readout does not allow a conclusion on the motion of the state as represented by the @xmath101-curve .",
    "finally we turn with a fuzziness of @xmath156 and @xmath157 to a parameter choice , which leads to representative curves for the intermediate regime . according to the fourier spectrum ( black ) in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b the @xmath101-curve is dominated by one frequency , which differs only little from the rabi frequency @xmath116 . in this regime",
    "the @xmath101-curve , which would characterize the state motion if no measurement were performed , is not much modified .",
    "the important point is that now the @xmath104-curve of the measurement readout ( grey ) shows a correlation with the @xmath101-curve regarding the phase : if the @xmath101-curve has a maximum , the @xmath104-curve is in the upper domain and for a minimum correspondingly .",
    "regarding the fourier spectrum of the measurement readout ( grey curve in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b ) , there is still a lot of noise , but a clear peak indicates the frequency of the @xmath101-curve .",
    "the measurement readout follows therefore closely the @xmath101-curve of the state motion in phase and frequency .",
    "this is even more convincing for the processed @xmath104-curve ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ figure3]a ) .",
    "the normalized state @xmath158 of a single two - level system performs oscillations under the influence of a resonant time dependent driving field .",
    "it is assumed that there is only one realization of this process available .",
    "we ask the question whether it is possible to visualize in real time the evolution of the system as far as it is given by @xmath1 .",
    "this result can clearly not be obtained by means of standard measurements which result in projections .",
    "generalized measurements , can be discussed by means of positive operator valued measures ( povm ) . for our goal we restrict to a particular subclass of unsharp measurements , which have a simple structure so that an experimental realization should be possible .",
    "the pointer values of this measurements are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we perform a sequence of measurements separated in time leading to the pointer readings @xmath159 .",
    "it can be shown that it is favorable to transform a series of @xmath10 pointer readings to one point of a measurement readout which is defined as best guess @xmath160 for @xmath1 .",
    "the single unsharp measurement must be weak enough as not to disturb the evolution of the system too much .",
    "on the other hand it must not be too weak in order to give information about the state of the system .",
    "we determined analytically the domains for the different open parameters such that this intermediate regime of measurement can be reached .",
    "the numerical analysis finally shows that for this intermediate regime the real time visualization of @xmath1 can be obtained to a satisfactory amount .",
    "the readout @xmath160 reflects rather well the resulting @xmath1 , which itself shows only a slight modification of the undisturbed rabi oscillations .",
    "note that above the rabi frequency of the unitary development was assumed to be known .",
    "if this is not the case a feed - back mechanism must be introduced so that after a certain time from the beginning of the measurements a visualization can be reached .",
    "this project is subject of future research .",
    "the authors thank peter marzlin for many stimulating discussions .",
    "this work has been supported by the optik zentrum konstanz .",
    "in order to detect the dynamics of @xmath101 we choose measurements with particular operations corresponding to a particular povm . we justify this choice as follows :    since our measurement scheme contains consecutive measurements , it is important to consider in which state the system is left after one measurement .",
    "we require the operations , which describe the transformation of the state up to a phase factor , to be such that the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not changed due to the measurement .",
    "hence these states should be eigenstates of the operations @xmath63 and @xmath64 in agreement with ( [ defm+ ] ) and ( [ defm- ] ) .",
    "we now address the question why @xmath140 should be positive operators , thus @xmath161 in ( [ defm+ ] ) and ( [ defm- ] ) ( second requirement of sect .  [ 2.1 ] ) . in the context of quantum feedback control",
    "one makes use of the fact that the operations may be decomposed into modulus and phase , in our case : @xmath162 where @xmath163 are unitary operators and @xmath164 . while the modulus @xmath165 , because of its relation to the effects @xmath166 , is connected to the acquisition of information , the unitary operators @xmath163 represent rather an additional hamiltonian evolution , not leading to any increase of information about the system ( compare wiseman @xcite and doherty et al .",
    "@xcite ) . if thus @xmath163 can not be used as a feedback to compensate the influence of @xmath165 , it only adds to the disturbance by the measurement and should be set @xmath167 ( a global phase factor @xmath168 is always neglected ) .    that the additional evolution represented by @xmath163 is indeed obstructive in our case can be made clear as follows .",
    "to be diagonalizable the @xmath140 have to be normal , i.e. , @xmath169=0 $ ] which amounts to @xmath170=0 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath163 and @xmath165 have a simultaneous basis of eigenvectors , which has to be @xmath2 and @xmath3 , because @xmath140 is required to be diagonal in that basis .",
    "now if @xmath163 is diagonal with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , it can be written as : @xmath171 for some angle @xmath172 and @xmath173 as pauli operator . in order to illustrate the corresponding different influences on the state motion",
    ", we refer to the bloch sphere .",
    "the resonant rabi oscillations which our system performs in the absence of measurements can be represented by a rotation of the normalized bloch vector in the y - z - plane ( given that the initial state lies in this plane ) .",
    "the measurement induces a change of the state given by @xmath140 .",
    "the contribution due to @xmath165 leads to a jump of the bloch vector towards one of the poles on the bloch sphere at @xmath174 and at @xmath175 .",
    "the bloch vector thereby does not leave the plane spanned by the state before the measurement and the z - axis .",
    "@xmath163 on the other hand forces the bloch vector to leave this plane . as a consequence @xmath163 can not compensate the change due to @xmath165 and the influence of @xmath165 is inevitable . beyond that , a unitary evolution @xmath176 disturbs the original rabi oscillations heavily in a succession of measurements by leading the bloch vector out of the y - z - plane .",
    "therefore we have to choose @xmath167 in order to disturb the rabi oscillations by the action of the operations @xmath140 as little as possible . in an experimental situation with nontrivial unitary transformations @xmath177 the state change due to @xmath177",
    "could be compensated by means of feedback ( compare wiseman @xcite ) .",
    "in this appendix we describe under which circumstances the concept of the best guess as introduced in sect .",
    "[ 3 ] can also be used for n - series with dynamical evolution due to the hamiltonian in ( [ h ] ) between the single measurements .    consider a n - series of unsharp measurements which are separated by the unitary evolution according to ( [ h ] ) . in the interaction picture the state after the first n - series thus reads : @xmath178 with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "we have to discuss for this new situation again the concept of a best guess . if we may commutate unitary evolution and operations representing the change due to the measurement , so that @xmath181 with @xmath182 we are back to the situation described in section [ 3.2 ] and the best guess @xmath127 of ( [ b2 ] ) may be taken as a good candidate to approximate @xmath129 .",
    "the underlying commutators are @xmath183=\\sigma_y(u_1^{\\pm}-u_2^\\pm ) \\sin(\\frac{\\pi\\tau}{t_r})\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath184 represents the pauli operator .",
    "although the commutators are small for @xmath185 , their contribution accumulates and is no longer negligible if the number @xmath10 of measurements within the n - series is too large .",
    "a lengthy calculation shows that for @xmath186 the term ( [ totev ] ) may be approximately written in the form ( [ sep ] ) , if @xmath187 here it was assumed that the matrix elements of the operation @xmath63 fulfill @xmath188 .",
    "otherwise the indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 in ( [ nbound ] ) have to be permutated .",
    "in this appendix the procedure is described we employed to simulate the measurements of rabi oscillations on the computer .",
    "it is denoted here in form of four instructions : + 1 ) evolve initial state unitarily according to the undisturbed dynamics of the system ; @xmath189 + 2 ) simulate single unsharp measurement in two steps . first generate a random outcome by a monte carlo method according to the probabilities @xmath190 . then change the state depending on the outcome @xmath191 .",
    "+ 3 ) n - series : carry out instructions 1 ) and 2 ) @xmath10 times , every time replacing the initial state by the state obtained after the previous unsharp measurement . after the n - series record @xmath192 of the current state and the measurement readout , i.e. , the best guess @xmath193 for @xmath194 .",
    "the best guess is calculated from the number of @xmath13-results ( c.f . equation ( [ b2 ] ) ) .",
    "+ 4 ) simulate @xmath195 times an n - series of unsharp measurements , always inserting as initial state the state obtained from the previous n - series .",
    "the total record of the simulation will then consist of a sequence of readouts @xmath127 and squared components of the state @xmath196 with @xmath197 .",
    "the readouts from the simulated measurements can now be processed to eliminate noise .",
    "we used the following method . + the sequence @xmath198",
    "is expressed by means of discrete fourier transform as @xmath199 , with @xmath200 . from the power - spectrum ( @xmath201 ) the main peak ( if present )",
    "is identified with the modified rabi frequency and the noise is estimated .",
    "the noise is reduced by transforming the fourier coefficients employing a wiener filter @xmath202 @xcite : @xmath203 .",
    "further noise reduction is achieved by omitting higher frequencies in the fourier series which can not be related to the original rabi oscillation .",
    "we truncated the fourier series after the @xmath204-th term , where @xmath205 is the frequency of the main peak of the power spectrum .",
