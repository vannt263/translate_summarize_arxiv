    "over the last twenty years , much effort has been invested in searching for a `` third parameter '' to reduce the scatter in the two - parameter tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) between the stellar luminosity and the rotation speed of spiral galaxies ( strauss & willick 1996 , courteau 1997 ; hereafter c97 , and references therein ) . for late - type spiral galaxies ,",
    "no other structural parameter ( such as the size , light concentration , or mean surface brightness of the galaxy ) appears to lead to a significant reduction in scatter . in short",
    ", the stellar luminosity alone seems to determine the rotation speed ( which we will define more precisely below ) of a spiral galaxy .",
    "it is common to model the rotation curves of individual galaxies with multi - component mass models , usually consisting of bulge , disk and dark halo components ( broeils 1992 , hereafter b92 ; van der kruit 1995 , hereafter vdk95 ) .",
    "the mass components representing the bulge and the disk are usually derived from the deprojected light - distribution , assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio , to be determined by the data .",
    "the assumed constancy of @xmath16 across a given galaxy is often justified on the basis of modest radial color gradients ( de jong 1995 ) and the small changes of vertical scale heights as a function of radius in late - type spirals ( van der kruit 1988 , de grijs & peletier 1997 ) . especially for data taken in the redder bands",
    "this approximation should be valid . with only a single value of @xmath16",
    ", analytical galaxy formation models can explain simultaneously the properties of hsb and lsb galaxies , like the slope and zero - point of the tf relation , very well ( dalcanton 1997 , mo , mao , & white 1998 ) .",
    "this provides further support for the constancy of @xmath16 among disk galaxies .",
    "dark matter halos in rotation curve decompositions have been modeled traditionally as isothermal spheres with a homogeneous core .",
    "because these multi - component fits to the rotation curve data are not unique , it appeared sensible to add a constraint , such as the  maximum disk \" or  minimum dark matter \" solution ( sancisi & van albada 1985 , carignan & freeman 1985 ) , to obtain a unique solution .",
    "these fits imply the highest possible value for @xmath16 , typically ranging from 3 to 5 in the @xmath17 band ( broeils & courteau 1997 ; hereafter bc97 ) and , in turn , lead to larger core radii for the halo .",
    "`` maximum disk '' fits have been very successful , matching almost all and rotation curve data ( b92 , buchhorn 1992 , bc97 ) , reproducing the small scale features of optical rotation curves well ( freeman 1993 ) , and satisfying constraints on spirals arms for non - interacting galaxies ( athanassoula 1987 ) .",
    "maximum disk models imply that for bright hsb sb - sc spirals , the stellar disk and bulge are the dominant mass components inside two exponential scale lengths .",
    "these galaxies are typically hi - deficient in their inner parts and the mass of the neutral gas is negligible ( broeils 1992 ) .",
    "an operational definition for the maximum disk hypothesis is that the stellar disk provides @xmath18 of the total rotational support of the galaxy at @xmath19 ( sackett 1997 ) . the lower boundary accounts for bars and massive bulges which reduce the contribution of the disk to the overall rotation curve .",
    "the upper boundary of this ratio is kept at 95% in order to prevent hollow cores in the dark halo .",
    "still , the validity of the maximum disk hypothesis has yet to be demonstrated unequivocally in external galaxies because of our inability to constrain @xmath16 , independent of mass models .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have computed mass decompositions for 10 late - type spirals with extended rotation curves previously modeled with an isothermal halo and maximum disk by broeils ( 1992 , p. 246 ) .",
    "we have repeated broeils modeling , but with a cosmologically motivated halo ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ; hereafter nfw ) and two values of @xmath16 corresponding to a maximal disk and lighter disk with @xmath20 .",
    "the data - model residuals are shown in figs .  1 & 2 .",
    "details regarding the fitting procedure will be given elsewhere .",
    "clearly , one can not discriminate in favor of any one mass model based on the quality of these multi - component fits ; the observed rotation curves are reproduced equally well by each fit .",
    "a similar result was also found by bc97 who modeled 290 rotation curves with @xmath17-band surface brightness profiles and found equally good fits using either a pure disk or a pure halo .",
    "this latter argument is however trivial given the limitations to constrain fitting parameters from shallow rotation curves .",
    "note also that the particular shape of the nfw halo does not play a role in constraining @xmath21 ; this is because of the strong covariance that exists between the concentration parameter of the nfw halo and @xmath16 .",
    "this is true of any other halo model with a core parameter .",
    "an example of such fitting is found in navarro ( 1997 , p. 408 ) for ngc 3198 .",
    "a related argument in support of maximum disks is that the luminous matter alone can reproduce the overall shape and small scale features of optical rotation curves ( buchhorn 1992 , freeman 1993 ) .",
    "the small - scale features are almost certainly the result of spiral wave streaming and offer weak support for maximum disks .",
    "this is confirmed by matching the bumpy features of the rotation curve with similar features in major - axis luminosity cuts .",
    "the match to the overall shape of the rotation curve is met just as well by pure halo or pure disks models ( bc97 ) .    in principle",
    ", there exists a technique to constrain @xmath16 uniquely , but it is difficult to implement in practice , and it still requires statistical arguments . for pure exponential disks ,",
    "the vertical ( azimuthal ) velocity dispersion and scale height of the stellar disk are linked to its mass density , independent of the halo mass ( van der kruit & searle 1981 , bahcall & casertano 1985 ) .",
    "if the disk scale length is also known , one can directly infer the mass of the disk .",
    "the measurement of velocity dispersions in stellar disks away from the central bulge and disk inhomogeneities is however difficult for large samples .",
    "the rapid surface brightness decline in stellar disks requires that absorption profiles beyond 1 - 2 disk scale lengths be measured with 8 - 10 m class telescopes .",
    "this technique also requires that galaxy properties be matched statistically since disk scale heights and scale lengths can not be measured in face - on and edge - on galaxies simultaneously .",
    "one attempt at this technique has been published so far ( bottema 1993 ) which suggests , based on a sample of 12 bulge - less systems and some assumptions about their stellar populations , that late - type spirals are sub - maximal with @xmath21 equal to @xmath22 at @xmath23    locally , most investigations of the galactic mass density near the sun support the notion of a significantly sub - maximal milky way disk with @xmath24 at @xmath25 ( kuijken 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "sackett ( 1997 ) however argues that new or revised structural data for the milky way would favor a maximal galactic disk .",
    "a crucial element in these models is the precise contribution of the massive central bar ( zhao , spergel , & rich 1995 ) or elongated bulge ( kuijken 1995 ) to the dynamical support in the inner parts of the galaxy , which is quite uncertain at present .",
    "the uncertainty in the disk scale length is also an issue ; a 25% difference above or below the nominal value of 3.5 kpc is sufficient to lend a sub - maximal result or not",
    ". published values for the disk scale length of the milky way currently differ by more than 30% ( sackett 1997 )",
    ".    numerical and analytical models of disk formation in a dissipationless dark matter halo also predict , for realistic total fractions of baryonic to dark matter , that spiral disks should be far from maximal ( blumenthal 1986 , barnes 1987 , flores 1993 , moore 1994 , nfw , dalcanton 1997 , mo , mao , & white 1998 , navarro 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore whether the tully - fisher relation , and its seemingly sole dependence on stellar luminosity , is consistent with `` maximal '' disks .",
    "the basic idea of our test is best described by a _",
    "gedankenexperiment _ : consider a pure exponential disk galaxy of a given luminosity , mass - to - light ratio , and disk scale length . in the absence of dark matter or bulge , its rotation curve is given by ( freeman 1970 ) , @xmath26,\\ ] ] where , @xmath27 is the gravitational constant , @xmath28 the central surface brightness , @xmath4 the disk exponential scale length , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind .",
    "the disk rotation curve will peak at @xmath32 at a value of @xmath2 .",
    "for disks of finite thickness ( say , @xmath33 ) the rotation curve will have a very similar shape but a @xmath34% lower peak ( casertano 1983 ) ; this will slightly affect the  shape \" term in square brackets in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , but leave the subsequent scalings untouched .",
    "imagine  compressing \" the same disk to a somewhat smaller scale length .",
    "the more compacted disk will peak at a higher rotation velocity , and dimensional analysis of eq .",
    "1 yields @xmath35 at fixed @xmath36 . thus , if dark matter is negligible inside 2.2@xmath37 , a 20% change in disk scale length  at a given disk mass  should translate into a 10% change of @xmath2 , hence into a @xmath38% offset in luminosity from the mean tfr .",
    "such an offset should be easily detectable in a statistical sense , given the size and quality of tfr samples currently available .",
    "of course , this effect will be altered by the presence of a dark matter halo and of a bulge , and we will devise a sequence of models that predicts @xmath39 for a wide range of disk - to - halo mass ratios .    even though in practice such a test requires to substitute @xmath40 for @xmath36 , our test does not rely on any assumption that @xmath41const ; it merely requires that @xmath16 be independent of surface brightness and that any gradient in @xmath42 for comparable disks be self - similar .    in  2 of this paper",
    ", we determine the mean value of @xmath39 for a set of well defined samples of luminous ( @xmath43 ) , non - barred hsb galaxies . in  3 , we compare this observed value to the predictions from a number of disk@xmath44halo models and examine the effects due to color gradients .",
    "this enables us to estimate what fraction of the rotation speed , @xmath14 at @xmath45 arises from the stellar disk .",
    "we discuss our results in  4 and offer a brief conclusion in  5 .",
    "to date , two large optical tf data sets have been published , from which we can determine @xmath2 for many hundreds of non - barred hsb galaxies .",
    "all galaxies are selected from the field , where dark matter halos have likely not overlapped or recently merged .",
    "we first use the collection of 306 sb - sc northern galaxies from courteau and faber ( courteau 1992 ; hereafter referred to as cf ) .",
    "the cf galaxies were selected from the ugc catalog using the following criteria : @xmath46 , blue major axis diameter @xmath47 , inclination between 55  and 75 , no bar , and no apparent interaction .",
    "the velocities @xmath2 were modeled via parametric fitting of the h@xmath48 rotation curves ( c97 ) and the ccd magnitudes and disk scale lenghts were measured in the gunn @xmath17 band ( courteau 1996 ) .",
    "specific details about galaxy selection can be found in courteau ( 1992 , 1996 ) .",
    "we use a sub - sample of the cf catalog in a region of quiet hubble flow ( qhf ) to minimise the effects of streaming and local infall motions on distance estimates ( courteau 1993 ) . for this analysis , the cf qhf sub - sample",
    "is further restricted to rotation curves that extend beyond @xmath49 ( so that @xmath2 is defined ) and to @xmath50 . only the brighter galaxies ( @xmath43 ) are retained where the dynamical contributions from the stellar disk are likely to be largest .",
    "all other cases , expect perhaps for bar - dominated galaxies , presumably yield a lower fraction of visible - to - total matter at @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath51 color is also computed from the rc3 b - band and cf @xmath17-band magnitudes are corrected for galactic and internal extinction . after all culling ,",
    "124 cf / qhf galaxies are kept for final analysis .",
    "we also use the collection of 1355 southern late - type spirals from mathewson , ford , & buchhorn ( 1992 ; hereafter mat ) .",
    "peculiar motions are not as conspicuous in this sample and no spatial culling is applied . excluding or retaining galaxies in the vicinity of the great attractor does not change the final result . as above for the cf sample , we restrict the total mat sample to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and require galaxies to have a measured @xmath54 color and i - band scale length .",
    "this yields a final sample of 406 mat galaxies .",
    "the @xmath55-band magnitudes and @xmath54 colors were corrected for internal and galactic extinction as described in willick ( 1997 ) .",
    "the fitting of @xmath2 for the mat galaxies is described in c97 .",
    "the disk scale lengths , from byun ( 1995 ) , were extracted from 2d bulge / disk decompositions of the galaxy images .",
    "five galaxies overlap between the cf and mat samples . with those",
    ", we can verify that our cf scalelengths and those measured by byun agree to within 10% .",
    "the typical uncertainty in published scalelengths for a given galaxy is about 23% ( knapen & van der kruit 1991 ) .",
    "the matching rotational amplitudes @xmath2 also agree very well , within 5% ( c97 ) .",
    "it is of interest to verify how adequately the surface density of disk galaxies is described by a pure exponential profile . using this information",
    ", we can show that our final result does not depend on any assumption about the shape of the luminosity profile of the disk .",
    "we compute the fraction of `` exponential light '' at a given radius as the ratio of the integrated light , based on the disk exponential fit , to the total observed light inside that radius .",
    "we measure two separate ratios at @xmath45 and at `` infinity . ''",
    "the total magnitude measured at infinity includes all the light from the galaxy plus a small extrapolation of the disk profile ( typically @xmath56 ) from its observed edge to infinity .",
    "a disk is deemed `` purely exponential '' if the ratio of `` exponential '' to observed light at a given radius does not deviate by more than 20% from unity . in fig .  3",
    ", we show exponential light ratios computed at @xmath45 and infinity for all 306 cf galaxies .",
    "more than three - quarters of the light profiles deviate from the idealized exponential disk model , some by more than 50% .",
    "galaxies left of the peak of the histogram have typically a larger bulge or can be described by a freeman type i luminosity profile ( freeman 1970 ) , whereas those on the right side correspond to a freeman type ii profile or will show a truncated disk .",
    "based on the criterion above , 85 cf galaxies , or 22% of the total cf sample , qualify as pure exponential disks .",
    "this ratio is closer to 18% for all mat galaxies .",
    "the tf distribution of all cf galaxies is shown in fig .  4 . the two distributions with circles and squares in each panel use absolute magnitudes _ measured _ at @xmath45 and infinity respectively .",
    "the solid line is the qhf tf fit from c97 and the dashed line is offset from that fit by 05 .",
    "this magnitude difference is that expected between the light measured at @xmath45 and at infinity for a pure exponential disk .",
    "the tf slopes are statistically equivalent and the zero - points differ by 062 @xmath57 005 , a little over the exponential disk value .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same distributions for pure exponential disks only ; here , the tf zero - point offset is exactly 05 , as expected by construction .",
    "the tf scatter for the qhf galaxies increases from 034 when total extrapolated magnitudes are used to 040 if the light interior to @xmath45 is used . as expected , there is no dependence of the tf scatter on the choice of magnitudes for the pure exponential galaxies ( @xmath58 in either case ) . in all cases , whether one considers the full cf sample or only the distribution of pure exponential disks , the tf slopes are equivalent within their statistical error ( independent of the choice of magnitude ) , meaning that dynamically , all late - type spirals behave as exponential disks .",
    "( c97 ) . ] .",
    "the data used in this study are : @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 or @xmath59 , a @xmath51 or @xmath54 color term , distance of the galaxy in mpc ( see c97 ) , and the fraction of exponential light in a galaxy .",
    "distance - dependent quantities assume @xmath60  as in c97 .",
    "a galaxy s rotation speed , size , and color correlate with its absolute luminosity ; these correlations are known as the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , freeman s law ( freeman 1970 ) , and the color - magnitude relation ( tully 1982 ) , and are shown in fig .  5 for our two samples .",
    "at present , we want to ask how various galaxy properties correlate _ at a given absolute luminosity_. hence we need to fit and remove the trends of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and color ( @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) with absolute magnitude ( @xmath63 or @xmath64 for each sample ) .",

    "further , the residual analysis shows that there is a slight ( but not statistically significant ) tendency that redder disks ( at a given luminosity ) are slightly more compact , and that redder disks have higher @xmath114 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "these trends are expected in a variety of evolutionary models for disk galaxies ( firmani & avila - reese 1998 ) .    before proceeding with a dynamical analysis (  3 ) one",
    "should explore the potential impact of stellar population variations among disks of the same luminosity .",
    "qualitatively , one would expect redder disks to have higher mass - to - light ratios , whether their colors are affected by dust , greater age , or higher metallicity . since",
    ", more compact disks are observed to be marginally redder ( table 2 ) , this would imply that the derived @xmath39 is lower than its  true \" value , and consequently the observed mean value of @xmath115 is an _",
    "upper _ limit to the actual dynamical contribution from the disk stars .    to be more quantitative about m / l variations _ among _ different disks",
    ", we have used population models ( vazdekis 1996 , their table 2 ) to determine how the stellar @xmath17-band @xmath116 varies with color . as a full exploration of this question",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper , we follow the common practice of using single age population models to match colors that arise from a more complex star - formation history , but which has resulted in the same luminosity weighted stellar age .",
    "we use population models with a mean age of @xmath117  gyrs and near - solar metallicity to find that @xmath118 \\sim 1 $ ] if the color differences are attributable to age differences , @xmath118 \\sim 0.4 $ ] if they are attributable to metallicity differences , and @xmath118 \\approx r_{b - r}/2.5 \\sim 1 $ ] for dust reddening , where @xmath119 is the ratio of total @xmath17-band extinction to the differential extinction @xmath120 .",
    "this last quantity will depend on the details of the dust distribution .",
    "for the benchmark case of a simple absorption screen with a mean galactic extinction curve , @xmath121 ( savage and mathis , 1979 ) .    in the context of these models , it appears the reddening due to stellar population age differences , and dust reddening imply the largest @xmath122 differences , with @xmath123 corresponding to a 25% increase in @xmath122 .",
    "another potential bias on the final value of @xmath39 is the wavelength dependence on scalelengths .",
    "the stellar disk mass is dominated by low - mass stars which emit most of their light in the redder bandpasses .",
    "therefore , k - band scalelengths may be most representative of the surface density of the disk population . scale lengths at red band passes are typically @xmath124 shorter than in the blue ( de jong 1995 , peletier & balcells 1997 ) .",
    "the ratio between the @xmath17 and @xmath55 band scalelengths and k - band scalelengths is about half that value but we will test for a more extreme difference of 10% .",
    "that is , we now measure @xmath125 at @xmath126 and use the shorter scalelength as our new fiducial . for both cf and mat galaxies ,",
    "this yields an 8% increase of @xmath127 .",
    "this effect is negligible and does not impact our conclusions . in the following",
    "we develop a dynamical analysis under the assumption that _ within our sample _ the stellar populations of disks at the same luminosity are similar .",
    "if the stellar disk were the only relevant mass component , we would expect @xmath9 , in the absence of color gradients . if , on the other hand , the stars are only test particles , then a difference in @xmath37 simply shifts the physical radius at which we determine @xmath2 . therefore , in this limiting case @xmath39 just reflects @xmath129 , the logarithmic gradient of the halo rotation curve at @xmath0 disk scale lengths .",
    "note that for halos with rising rotation curves ( isothermal with a core , or nfw ) one finds @xmath130 . as a consequence",
    ", one would expect a surface brightness , or disk size , dependence in the @xmath131 relation , both for the case of dominant and of negligible disk mass , yet with _",
    "opposite sign_. consequently , there must be an intermediate case , where the stellar disk is somewhat important and the surface brightness disappears .",
    "the actual situation will be bracketed by these two extremes .",
    "below , we explore how @xmath39 depends on the fraction of the circular velocity at @xmath45 that is attributable to the stellar disk , @xmath21 .",
    "we first examine a simple exponential disk embedded in dark matter halo . for the _ initial _ dark matter halo structure ,",
    "we use a density profile @xmath132^{-2}$ ] found in the collisionless cdm simulations of halo formation by nfw .",
    "these simulations indicate that this initial structure only depends on the total halo mass , which translates into the total stellar mass , if the baryonic fraction is constant among halos of identical mass , and if most cooled baryons have been converted into stars .",
    "if the central accumulation of the baryons occurs on a longer time scale than the local dynamical time , the dissipationless dark matter halo will contract obeying adiabatic invariance ( blumenthal 1986 ) .",
    "calculating this adjustment is easy in spherical geometry ( flores 1993 , nfw ) , but requires replacement of the disk configuration by the spherical density profile that has the same enclosed mass @xmath133 ( see binney & tremaine 1987 , eq . 2 - 170 ) .",
    "it is well known that this procedure leads to a somewhat incorrect rotation curve , but we are only interested in derivatives .",
    "the final disk rotation curve is still computed using eq . 1 , and the final dark matter distribution is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the total mass within radius @xmath136 before disk formation ( nfw ) .    using a scdm halo profile from nfw with @xmath137  and assuming a baryon fraction of @xmath138 , we calculated the combined disk@xmath44halo rotation curves for various @xmath16 and for @xmath139  kpc , corresponding to a range of @xmath21 at @xmath45 .",
    "then we changed @xmath4 by 5% retaining the total disk mass and the _ initial _",
    "( uncontracted ) halo profile , and repeated the calculation to estimate @xmath39 for each value of @xmath21 .",
    "our choice of @xmath140 and @xmath4 is representative of the milky way and the @xmath141 galaxies considered in this study",
    ". we will show below that our result is rather insensitive to reasonable variations in our disk and halo parameters .",
    "experiments with @xmath142 showed that the finite change has no significant impact on the estimate of the gradient . in cases",
    "where a central bulge is included (  3.2 ) , the spheroid remains unchanged when considering the small changes in @xmath4 for the gradient calculation .",
    "an example of such a contraction is shown in fig .",
    "the estimated gradients are shown as the short - dashed line connecting the open circles in fig .",
    "note also that for low mass disks , @xmath143 , the gradient @xmath39 becomes positive , because the halo rotation curve is rising , and an increase in @xmath4 means that @xmath2 is measured at greater metric radii .",
    "these results are insensitive to the adopted disk scale length or rotation curve amplitude provided representative values are used . if we choose @xmath144  kpc ( 4 kpc ) in the calculations , the value of @xmath39 at a given @xmath21 increases ( decreases ) in the mean by only 0.03 ( see fig .",
    "9 ) from our nominal case .",
    "disk scale lengths for hsb galaxies vary typically between 2kpc and 6kpc ( courteau 1996 ) .",
    "similar modest excursions for @xmath39 are found if we use different rotation curve amplitudes .",
    "the value of @xmath140 is a slow function of the optical velocity , or @xmath2 , and is typically smaller than @xmath2 for hsb galaxies ( the opposite is true for lsb galaxies ) .",
    "we have experimented with a range of halo velocities from 160 to 200 , or a variation in @xmath2 of 150 to 300  ( depending on the cosmology ) .",
    "the value of @xmath39 increases in the mean by less than 0.03 per 10  increments in @xmath140 for a given disk mass and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this is because the shape of the logarithmic nfw rotation curve changes little over such amplitude increments at @xmath2 .",
    "this is also depicted in fig .",
    "these tests were performed with and without a bulge component ( see below ) .",
    "thus our results are only weakly dependent on the exact value of @xmath140 and @xmath37 provided we use reasonable estimates for @xmath141 galaxies .",
    "our nominal halo velocity , @xmath145  corresponds to @xmath146  for an @xmath147 cdm universe ( navarro 1998 ) .",
    "our choice of baryon fraction is consistent with the latest d / h abundances ( burles & tytler 1998 , levshakov 1998 ) which give @xmath148 .",
    "the specific choice of @xmath149 is inconsequential for this analysis ; results are essentially unchanged if we adopt @xmath150 ( = 70 ) .      even considering the late - type spirals of our sample",
    ", the bulge component may not be dynamically negligible .",
    "therefore , we repeated the above calculation including in the rotation curve calculation a spheroid with 20% of the disk mass and a scale radius of 500  pc .",
    "such a bulge mass fraction is an upper - limit for these sb@xmath44sc galaxies ( bc97 ) .",
    "we repeated the same analysis as above with this new component in the halo contraction and rotation curve calculation .",
    "the resulting @xmath39 are shown as the solid line connecting the triangles in fig  9 .",
    "it is evident that even a large bulge for these galaxies makes little difference for this calculation at @xmath45 ( see also mo 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we explore how sensitive are these results to the particular functional form of the assumed dark matter profile . to this end",
    ", we repeated our calculations starting from an isothermal dark matter halo with an initial core radius @xmath151 .",
    "the resulting dependence of @xmath39 on @xmath21 is shown by the long - dashed line connecting the open squares in fig .",
    "the result is again quite similar to the previous two cases .",
    "choosing a larger core radius makes little difference for heavy disks ( @xmath152 ) , but leads to rotation curve shapes for very light disks that are linearly rising within @xmath153 , grossly inconsistent with the observations for these luminous , hsb disks ( c97 ) .",
    "the derivative @xmath154 is a function of ( at least ) four variables : the initial values of @xmath140 ( assumed to be directly coupled to the nfw concentration parameter ) and @xmath37 , the disk size , mass and disk mass - to - light ratio . if the initial halo structure and size of the disk were coupled , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath140 varied systematically with @xmath37 , it would change the interpretation of @xmath154 . to impact our conclusions , the denser , or more concentrated , halos of a given mass scale ( nfw predict a 25 % scatter in their concentration parameter ) would need to harbor larger than average disks .",
    "the dark matter could aid the lower surface brightness stellar disks to yield the same rotation speed at @xmath2 as that of their higher surface brightness cousins and remove any surface brightness trend in the tf relation , even in the presence of a near - maximal disk .",
    "there seems to be broad agreement that ( at least for systems with small bulges , little merging ) the disk size is regulated by the initial angular momentum ( _ e.g. _ mo , mao and white , 1998 ) . for the purpose of our analysis",
    ", it suffices that there exists a monotonic mapping between total initial angular momentum and final disk size ; this would mean that larger disks ( at a given total baryonic mass ) come from baryon / dark matter systems with higher initial spin parameters @xmath155 ( see also  3.5.2 in mo , mao & white 1998 ) . when considering halos of the same mass scale but with different spin - parameters @xmath155 one might suspect that the halos , too , become more extended ( or less concentrated ) at higher @xmath155 , analogous to the disks . in this case",
    "the surface mass density of both disk and halo would drop at higher @xmath155 , and one would necessarily expect an sb dependence of the tfr .",
    "the halo concentration is found to be independent of the spin parameter @xmath155 ( see also  3.5.2 in mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "hence , at least in the context of hierarchical formation simulations , one would not expect any correlation between the ( initial ) halo structure and size of the disk .",
    "this is implicit in our derivation .",
    "we calculate @xmath39 using halo parameters that depend only on the total mass .",
    "hence our conclusion is somewhat model dependent , but one which follows from current hierarchical scenarios .",
    "note that the initial halo choice matters least for a dominant disk , where the final halo structure in the inner parts is predominantly determined by the ( adiabatic ) contraction process .",
    "we have not investigated the ( random ) scatter in the initial halo concentrations but this would merely contribute to weakening our model - data comparison and the power of our statistical tests and we believe our conclusions to be conservative in this respect .",
    "the mean value of @xmath39 in both cf and mat samples of exponential disks is @xmath156 . by taking the range of @xmath21 for which our models predict @xmath39 in this range ( fig .  8)",
    ", we find a mean value of @xmath157 .",
    "this range can be widened if we adopt limits determined from each sample separately ; in this case , we would have @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , our mean relation is inconsistent with @xmath159 , the mimimum boundary for a `` maximal disk '' ( sackett 1997 ) , at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this statement holds for any reasonable combination of @xmath140 , @xmath37 , the mass of the disk , and @xmath16 .",
    "that is , we have tested for any combination of our model input parameters and can not produce @xmath159 for @xmath160 , the absolute maximum allowed by our global data exceeds 0.75 . ] .",
    "the need to consider the actual distribution of the light in any dynamical measurements ( mass decomposition ) , instead of assuming _ a priori _ an average luminosity profile , can not be overemphasized ( see kalnajs 1983 ) .",
    "we did indeed restrict our analysis to galaxies with a nearly pure exponential light profile",
    ". however , this distinction turns out to matter little for our statistical analysis .",
    "inclusion of all types of galaxy profiles would bias the value @xmath39 towards larger fractions of dark - to - total matter at @xmath45 by no more than 15% of the actual value for pure exponential disks , with @xmath161 and a 95% upper limit of 0.66 ( courteau & rix 1998 ) .",
    "inspection of eqs .",
    "1 and 2 shows that our analysis is insensitive to the assumption of exponential disks : as long as the rotation curve shape factor in eq .",
    "1 , @xmath162 $ ] , does not depend strongly on @xmath4 at a fixed luminosity , eq .",
    "2 holds exactly . for the remainder of this discussion",
    ", we adopt the ratio @xmath163 as our nominal result .",
    "our main argument is based on possible correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath4 which can be ruled out statistically in the presence of the observed scatter .",
    "as long as the sources of the scatter are not systematically linked to the correlation of interest , their nature , cause or origin is inconsequential .",
    "for example , inclination errors and hubble - flow distance errors are not systematically linked to either @xmath2 and @xmath4 and we did not consider them explicitly . color gradients ( dust , stellar populations ) are relevant sources of scatter that might vary systematically with disk scale length . however , as we saw in  2.3 , correction for color differences can only increase the ratio of dark - to - visible matter at @xmath45 .",
    "this is because the mean inferred value of @xmath21 is an upper limit to the contribution of the disk mass to the rotation speed at @xmath45 .",
    "the dynamical interpretation of this gradient is only slightly altered if we consider the dependence of stellar population on disk mass - to - light ratios ( bottema 1997 , hereafter b97 ) .",
    "b97 examined population differences between lsb and hsb galaxies using crude population synthesis arguments , and showed that dust or metallicity gradients in spiral galaxies can account for @xmath124 of @xmath164 our own estimates in  2.3 using the population models of vazdekis 1996 , suggest that the impact of age and dust on @xmath21 can be even larger with an increase of 25% in @xmath122 , or a 50% decrease of @xmath21 .",
    "this would lower @xmath21 to @xmath165 for color offsets @xmath166 from the mean .",
    "this value is in agreement with the data if the maximum observed color trends seen in fig .",
    "8 for @xmath4 and @xmath2 are removed from the distribution of @xmath39 . however , because colors depend strongly on the star formation history of the galaxy , more detailed chemical and spectral evolutionary models based on different galaxy formation scenarios ( merging , extended collapse ) are needed to address the interplay between colors and the dynamical properties of galaxies on firmer grounds (  firmani & avila - reese 1998 , sommerville & primack 1998 )",
    ".    arguments in favor of sub - maximal disks have been given by van der kruit ( 1995 ) and a few were highlighted in  1 .",
    "abiding by the definition that a disk is `` maximal '' if @xmath167 ( sackett 1997 ) , we have effectively shown that non - barred late - type spirals are , _ on average _ , sub - maximal at @xmath45 , and that the halo contributes @xmath168 , within that radius .",
    "sub - maximal disks with @xmath169 imply @xmath170 , a factor of two smaller than maximal disk values ( bottema 1993 , bc97 ) .",
    "this corresponds to twice more dark matter in the inner parts of late - type spirals than previously accounted for by maximal disk fits .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models of spiral galaxies suggest mass - to - light ratios in the range 1 - 2 ratios depends significantly on the choice of initial mass function . here , we assume a scalo imf truncated at @xmath171 and @xmath172 in the @xmath17-band , with possible extremes up to 5 for very red systems ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "thus , there is good agreement between these models and our result .",
    "the same is also true with the work of bottema ( 1993 ) who combined measurements of velocity dispersion , scale length , and scale height of exponential disks to infer that old disks contribute at most @xmath173 of the observed maximum rotation at a given luminosity .",
    "another supportive result is that of quillen & sarajedini ( 1998 ) who find that low values of the disk @xmath174 in the range 1 - 2 are required to explain stable disks at @xmath175 . in order to avoid unrealistically thick disks",
    ", one must invoke a substantial amount of dark matter in the inner parts of these distant disks , in agreement with our study of low redshift galaxies .",
    "swing amplification theory ( athanassoula 1987 ) puts a constraint on the density of galactic disks in order to preserve m=2,3 modes ( and inhibit m=1 modes ) .",
    "the low values of @xmath16 observed here are in complete agreement with the observed spiral structure of late - type disks .",
    "while our statistical argument favors sub - maximal disks in the majority of hsb non - barred disk galaxies , it does not completely exclude the possibility that some galactic disks could be maximal .",
    "such disks are more likely to be found in lighter or less centrally concentrated halos or equivalently , systems of very high surface brightness or low angular momentum .",
    "ostriker and peebles ( 1973 ) have shown that a massive halo will suppress bar instabilities in the disk .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that bar - dominated galaxies may exhibit a higher fraction of luminous - to - dark matter at their center , to the point of possibly being maximal ( quillen & frogel 1998 , bottema & gerritsen 1998 , debattista & sellwood 1998 , weiner 1998 ) .",
    "the current analysis together with other recent studies , suggest a continuum of luminous - to - dark matter content in spiral galaxies directly proportional to their mean surface brightness ( or initial angular momentum ) .",
    "lsb and dwarf galaxies appear to be fully dm dominated at all radii ( broeils 1992 , zwaan 1995 , bottema 1997 , ct 1997 , dalcanton 1997 , de  blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) , non - barred hsbs are sub - maximal in their inner parts ( bottema 1993 , this work ) , and bar - dominated galaxies which exhibit , on average , higher surface brightnesses than typical tully - fisher galaxies may possibly be maximal . following this argument",
    ", one may infer that our milky way , if it does harbor a strong bar at its center , could indeed be maximal ( sackett 1997 ) .",
    "more explorations of the central regions of our galaxy and the structure of extragalactic disks and bulges are desperately needed .",
    "we have shown that the tf relation , when cast as @xmath3  _ vs. _  @xmath2 , is independent of surface brightness for hsb galaxies . we are lead to interpret this empirical result as evidence for large quantities of non - luminous matter in the inner parts ( @xmath176 ) of late - type galaxies",
    ". we have employed simple models for the contraction of the dark matter halo by adiabatic infall of baryons ( the  luminous component \" ) . for halos with initially rising rotation curves , this contraction leads to approximately flat , or featureless , rotation curves , _ and _ to a tf relation that is independent of surface - brightness , if @xmath177 in the mean .",
    "this analysis assumes that the initial halo structure is uncorrelated with the size of the resulting disk , as suggested by current cosmological simulations .",
    "combined with the empirical tf evidence , this model invalidates the notion of maximal disks for the majority of hsb late - type spirals . our result is independent of the shape of the luminosity profiles and large variations in our choice of model parameters .",
