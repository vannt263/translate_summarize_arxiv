    "a pair of majorana bound states at the ends of one - dimensional _ p_-wave superconductors hosts a nonlocal fermionic mode at an energy close to the middle of the energy gap.@xcite the nonlocality of the fermionic mode has inspired proposals to observe nonlocal current correlations which arise when electrons are transported through the mode from a lead contacting the left bound state to a lead contacting the right.@xcite unfortunately , nonlocal transport is completely suppressed in favor of local andreev reflection for ideal majorana bound states at zero energy and the currents through the left and right lead are uncorrelated with characteristic peak conductances @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite later , it has been pointed out that a coupling @xmath2 between the majorana end states that is larger then the lead - induced level broadening @xmath3 is required for a recovery of nonlocal current correlations.@xcite by increasing the length of the superconductor @xmath4 the coupling constant @xmath2 decays exponentially such that for sufficiently long topological superconductors the transport remains local despite the nonlocal nature of the fermionic zero mode .",

    "due to the suppression of local andreev reflection , the analysis can be carried out in the usual mean - field setup of superconductivity without violating current conservation.@xcite subsequent studies have considered the behavior of the peak conductance as the charging energy is lowered away from the coulomb blockade regime , finding a smooth increase from the peak conductance @xmath0 in the coulomb blockade regime to @xmath1 in the absence of charging energy.@xcite    ) setup consisting of a one - dimensional topological superconductor ( ts ) that is floating and hosts ideal zero - energy majorana bound states @xmath6 , @xmath7 contacted by two normal - conducting , non - interacting leads ( n ) .",

    "however , the presence of the large global charging energy , which is a strong , nonlocal perturbation at the level of the hamiltonian , makes it difficult to unambiguously attribute the nonlocal current correlations to the presence of the majorana bound states.@xcite in this sense , a large charging energy can be considered ill - suited for probing the majorana - induced nonlocality .    in this work",

    "the contradiction to the results of refs .   can be resolved by noting that away from the coulomb blockade regime , transport into the cooper pair condensate is no longer blocked energetically and current conservation has to be enforced self - consistently.@xcite this appears to be technically demanding in the interacting setup of finite charging energy . even though the peak conductances does not distinguish the two regimes , the transport mechanisms differ strongly . in the coulomb - blockade regime ,",
    "the cooper - pair condensate is irrelevant and transport proceeds by sequential tunneling which can be modeled as coherent transport through a double barrier.@xcite in contrast , in the non - interacting case , transport is incoherent due to the presence of the cooper - pair condensate which acts as a phase - breaking scatterer.@xcite we will show that while the difference between the two transport regimes is not captured by the peak conductance , it is reflected in the shot noise properties .",
