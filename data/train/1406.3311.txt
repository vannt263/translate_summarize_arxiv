    "can reveal the presence of a second dynamical phase .",
    "importantly , the separation of trajectories into distinct classes can be made rigorous by demonstrating a singularity in the appropriate scaled cumulant generating function  @xcite .",
    "conversely , demonstrating such a singularity implies a broad distribution for dynamical fluctuations , which can rationalize experimentally observed dynamical heterogeneity .",
    "this perspective has been elaborated in several interesting contexts  @xcite , albeit in most cases for complicated many - body systems that do not permit full analytical solutions and are thus not entirely transparent .",
    "notable examples include lattice and molecular models of glasses  @xcite , asymmetric exclusion processes  @xcite and zero - range processes  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that similarly complex behavior can emerge in seemingly very simple systems which do permit an analytical treatment .",
    "specifically , we have shown that a dynamic phase transition can be demonstrated analytically for a biased random walker on a ring with a single impurity in the transition rates  @xcite .",
    "the relatively simple analytics of our random walker model provides an excellent arena for addressing two basic questions about dynamic phase transitions .",
    "firstly , under what conditions will a dynamic phase transition emerge ?",
    "secondly , are there physical methods for modulating the dynamics to achieve coexistence between dynamical phases or to induce transitions between them ?    to this end , here we investigate the statistics of two dynamical order parameters whose fluctuations can reveal the phase transition .",
    "we analytically construct the joint rate function for entropy production ( eq .  [ eq : entropyproductiondef ] ) and dynamical activity  @xcite ( eq .  [ eq : activitydef ] ) , which is analogous to a two dimensional free energy surface .",
    "the two - dimensional rate function in all cases reveals two basins , corresponding to two distinct classes of trajectories , one localized and the other delocalized .",
    "when one of the order parameters is integrated out , the remaining marginal distribution does not necessarily reveal the underlying bistability .",
    "in particular , we show regimes for which the dynamical activity statistics is influenced by two dynamical phases while the fluctuations in entropy production reveal only a single phase .",
    "the dynamic phase transition implies the existence of a rare localized class of trajectories  @xcite .",
    "we investigate conditions required to induce the transition , thereby causing the localized trajectories to become typical . in conventional statistical mechanics",
    "a rare phase can be made dominant by adjusting intensive fields like temperature , pressure , or chemical potential .",
    "the statistical mechanics of trajectories is more complicated as the field conjugate to a dynamical order parameter ( the @xmath0 or @xmath1 field throughout this paper ) is time - non - local and therefore can not be experimentally tuned in a straightforward way .",
    "we construct markov matrices which ( in the long time limit ) are equivalent to the natural dynamics with a @xmath0 or @xmath1 field  @xcite .",
    "these markov matrices reveal the _ physical _ values of the rate constants which would place the two dynamical phases at coexistence . in other words , with the computed set of rate constants , long trajectories switch back and forth equally between localized and delocalized behavior . using the markov matrices that generate effective @xmath0 field dynamics ,",
    "we also show that @xmath0 field biasing can not induce non - equilibrium currents that violate detailed balance .",
    "these biasing techniques can amplify ( or suppress ) existing non - equilibrium currents , but when applied to an equilibrium system the methods simply transform from one detail balanced dynamics to another .    finally , we consider the problem of observed heterogeneity in cell growth rates and apply results from our model system to elucidate this phenomenon . in particular , it has been observed that a stochastic subpopulation of cells in an _",
    "e. coli _ colony exhibit markedly reduced growth rates  @xcite . these cells , labeled persisters , are more likely to survive antibiotic treatment  @xcite . treating our model system as an extremely simplified version of the cell growth cycle ,",
    "we argue that the phenomenon of persistence should be a generic consequence of a class of localized trajectories that is rare in the absence of antibiotics .",
    "we show how treating cells with different strengths of antibiotics in experiments might be equivalent to effectively tuning a @xmath0 field and induce a transition between different dynamical behaviors .",
    "we also note that coexistence in the space of trajectories can facilitate massive dynamical fluctuations which are evocative of those observed in other biological contexts such as growing polymers including microtubules  @xcite , actin  @xcite , and bacterial homologs thereof  @xcite , where trajectories exhibit a stark switching between growing and collapsing behaviors .",
    "our work clarifies the conditions required for such phase coexistence in trajectories and also illuminates the properties of the phase transition .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : framework ] we review the basic structure of the large deviation calculations .",
    "we then introduce our solvable model system in section [ sec : scgf ] and derive the scaled cumulant generating function , the legendre transform of which yields the entropy production and activity statistics . using this result ,",
    "we discuss in section [ sec : props ] the nature of a dynamic phase transition and the conditions for which the transition can be observed by these order parameters .",
    "finally , we address implications of such a dynamic phase transition . we both identify conditions for dynamical coexistence in which the two phases contribute equally and discuss the way in which the response of cells to antibiotic treatment may expose a similar underlying transition .",
    "we consider continuous - time markovian dynamics on a discrete state space .",
    "such a stochastic dynamics is compactly represented by a master equation with rate matrix @xmath2 whose off - diagonal elements @xmath3 detail the rates of transition from state @xmath4 to state @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of the set of all possible trajectories is well - defined in the steady - state .",
    "we investigate both typical and rare dynamical fluctuations by considering the behavior of dynamic order parameters .",
    "time - additive dynamic order parameters are particularly relevant to many experiments as they report on cumulative dynamical behavior , for example the net current observed in a finite time experiment . in this paper we consider two such order parameters , the entropy production and the dynamical activity .",
    "the entropy production of a trajectory is defined in the stochastic thermodynamics sense as the log ratio of forward and reverse probabilities  @xcite .",
    "we focus on continuous time hopping processes , in which case the entropy production can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the forward and reverse rate constants for each hop . the dynamical activity , @xmath9 , simply counts the total number of hops . @xmath10",
    "this accounting of microscopic transitions has been used most predominantly in the study of glassy dynamics  @xcite . whereas the entropy production provides a measure of the dissipation associated with a trajectory ,",
    "the dynamical activity indicates how labile the dynamics is . by considering both order parameters",
    "we highlight how the statistics of various observables may be differently affected by the dynamic phase transition .",
    "the time - additivity of these order parameters allows their probability distribution to be described by a large deviation form , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the joint large deviation rate function and @xmath13 is the entropy production rate .",
    "the rate function @xmath12 can be computed as the legendre transform of the scaled cumulant generating function  @xcite , @xmath14 where the expectation value is taken over trajectories initialized in the steady state distribution .",
    "this function can in turn be obtained as the maximum eigenvalue of a tilted operator , @xmath15 , which is simply related to @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "specifically the matrix elements are given by @xmath16 by solving for the eigenspectrum of @xmath15 we can thus compute the long time limit of @xmath17 via a legendre transform .    fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] graphically illustrates the relationships between probability distributions for the dynamic order parameters , rate functions , and scaled cumulant generating functions .",
    "in particular , the singularities in @xmath18 generate bistable order parameter distributions . for the type of ergodic dynamics studied here these bistable distributions tend toward a strictly concave rate function in the long time limit  @xcite , which is the legendre transform of the scaled cumulant generating function with a maxwell construction . despite the underlying bistability of the distribution shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon](d ) , the marginals of that distribution need not illustrate a bistability , if the two basins are appropriately aligned .",
    "we now shift our attention to a particular solvable model , whereby computing @xmath18 we can determine conditions for phase transitions in the two order parameters .",
    "we consider dynamics of a single particle on a network of @xmath19 states arranged in a ring as depicted in fig .",

    "a trajectory on the network corresponds to a sequence of hops from state to state with a poisson - distributed waiting time between hops determined by the rate constants @xmath22 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . without loss of generality we focus on the case that @xmath24 such that typical trajectories cycle in the clockwise direction . for generic choices of @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 the dynamics is out - of - equilibrium , which can be seen most simply since the probability of clockwise cycles differs from that of counter - clockwise cycles  @xcite . because the network supports only a single cycle",
    ", it is one of the simplest models for non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "this simplicity enables an analytic solution in the limit that the ring grows infinitely large . because analytically solvable non - equilibrium models are few , these solutions can provide a useful reference point .",
    "we focus on a large @xmath19 limit which maintains the discrete nature of the states .",
    "this limit is appropriate for chemical reaction kinetics with transitions among a discrete set of states  @xcite",
    ". it may also be interesting to consider continuum limits with rates scaled by @xmath19 .",
    "such a continuum limit is pertinent to a brownian particle confined to a ring  @xcite , and has been discussed in a freidlin - wentzell framework without a heterogeneity in the limit of small noise  @xcite .    following the framework of section  [ sec : framework ]",
    ", the tilted operator can be written down straightforwardly as @xmath25 for modest @xmath19 one can numerically calculate the largest eigenvalue of this matrix to yield the scaled cumulant generating function @xmath26 . in the large @xmath19 limit , however , we can obtain an analytic form for the limiting behavior using a perturbation theory we recently outlined  @xcite .",
    "were it not for the heterogeneous link , there would be a translational symmetry allowing the tilted operator to be exactly diagonalized via a fourier transform . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a particular region of the @xmath27 plane , the maximum eigenvalue of the tilted operator in eq .",
    "coincides with this solution for the translationally symmetric network in the large @xmath19 limit . @xmath18 exhibits a cusp along the boundary of this region .",
    "one side of the boundary corresponds to a maximal right eigenvector of the tilted operator which is delocalized while on the other side the eigenvector is exponentially localized around the heterogeneous link .",
    "the discontinuity of the slopes of @xmath18 when crossing this boundary indicates a dynamic phase transition between classes of trajectories which are localized and those which are delocalized .",
    "the detailed calculation , provided in appendix  [ app : jointcalc ] , reveals that the line of cusps separating localized from delocalized eigenvectors is given by the logarithm of the roots of a quadratic ,    @xmath28    this equation , corresponding to the purple dashed curve in the schematic of fig .",

    "[ fig : psih1h2xvals](a ) .",
    "remarkably , the value of @xmath18 everywhere can be determined by the solution to the translationally symmetric network and the form of @xmath30 .",
    "this follows since @xmath18 is continuous and the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath0 must vanish in the localized regime   must then yield a zero entropy production . ] .",
    "the translationally symmetric network solution evaluated along the line of cusps thus provides the maximum eigenvalue in the localized region giving @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are shorthand for @xmath30 given in eq .",
    "and for the inverse function @xmath34   is the same for either choice of the inverse . ] .",
    "this is our primary analytical result , which enables the computation of the probability distributions for entropy production and activity rates . to prevent confusion",
    ", we note that the schematic of fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] was meant to depict generic joint distributions for activity and entropy production and does not illustrate @xmath18 for this particular solved model .",
    "thus far we have merely asserted that the trajectories have localized and delocalized character in the two dynamic phases , but here we more formally make the claims by analyzing the maximal right eigenvectors of the tilted operator .",
    "we write the elements of the maximal eigenvector as @xmath35 and note that the eigenvalue equation implies a recursion relation between neighboring @xmath36 s in the bulk .",
    "@xmath37 where we have introduced the transfer matrix @xmath38 and suppressed the subscripts and arguments on @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath39 component of the eigenvector can thus be written in terms of the two eigenvalues of of @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . specifically , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 serves to match up the boundary conditions between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . when @xmath48 , the eigenvalues of @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath49 , and @xmath50 correct up to second order in @xmath51 .",
    "an expression for @xmath52 in terms of the rate constants , eq .  , follows from the full calculation of the maximum eigenvalue in appendix  [ app : jointcalc ] .",
    "hence the maximal right eigenvector is found to have components @xmath53 where @xmath54 . the first term in eq .",
    "decays slowly over the entire range of the system , giving the eigenvector a delocalized character .",
    "this delocalized character indicates that trajectories with high rates of entropy production and activity can be found regularly visiting all of the states of the system .    under the conditions that @xmath55 the expression for @xmath52 diverges , and the delocalized form for the maximal eigenvector given in eq .   must break down  .",
    "we anticipate a similar functional form for the eigenvectors except with some nonzero @xmath56 replacing @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , with some tedious algebra it can be shown that the right eigenvectors are given by @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "unlike the case of the delocalized eigenvector , this solution is strongly localized around the heterogeneous link .",
    "thus the flat region between the two cusps in @xmath61 stems from a class of localized trajectories which are incapable of producing entropy in the long - time limit .",
    "the two dynamic phases can therefore be thought of as the classes of localized and delocalized trajectories , each of which contributes its own feature to the rate function .",
    "we previously reported on the entropy production statistics in the special case that @xmath62  @xcite , but this restriction was lifted in the preceding analysis .",
    "surprisingly , allowing for distinct values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 can yield a qualitative difference in the entropy production rate statistics .",
    "when @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constrained to be equal , all values of @xmath63 and @xmath22 give rise to singularities in @xmath64 and therefore a dynamic phase transition with respect to the entropy production rate . by solving for the conditions when @xmath65 in eq .",
    "one can obtain the position of these two cusps in @xmath66 , @xmath33 and @xmath67 .    when @xmath20 and @xmath21 are distinct , however , there are conditions for which @xmath30 lacks roots .",
    "the fluctuation theorem  @xcite entails a symmetry in the cumulant generating function @xmath66 about @xmath68 .",

    "[ fig : xvalsplots ] we plot these rate functions for a variety of values of @xmath22 but for the same value of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "as @xmath22 is decreased , the system is biased less strongly toward clockwise cycles , and the average entropy production rate decreases correspondingly . however , even when the average entropy production rate is large , the class of localized trajectories present a way for a trajectory to produce zero entropy .",

    "when @xmath22 is decreased below @xmath84 , this shoulder at @xmath83 gets completely engulfed by the natural fluctuations in entropy production characterizing the dominant ( delocalized ) class of trajectories .",
    "thus the disappearance of the dynamic phase transition corresponds to the condition when near - zero entropy production rates are more likely to be obtained by a delocalized trajectory than by a localized trajectory . as we shall demonstrate",
    "shortly , the lack of the dynamic phase transition in the entropy production order parameter does not rule out the presence of two classes of trajectories .",

    "note that the surface is smooth , exhibiting only small fluctuations away from the mean behavior .",
    "in contrast , when the heterogeneous link is introduced a ridge develops along @xmath83 .",
    "this ridge corresponds to the class of localized trajectories , all of which have identically zero entropy production rate in the long time limit .",
    "the entropy production and activity rate functions are marginals of this two dimensional surface , which corresponds to projecting the surface onto the @xmath92 and @xmath93 axes , respectively .",

    "the calculation offers an important lesson which provides insight for more complicated dynamical systems .",

    "the joint rate function demonstrates two dynamical phases  one localized and the other delocalized  but the marginal rate functions do not exhibit the underlying transition under all conditions .",
    "specifically , the marginal rate function corresponding to the entropy production has a critical point beyond which there is no dynamic phase coexistence even though the system still supports two distinct classes of trajectories .",
    "we illustrated the rates that position the system in a state of coexistence between localized and delocalized phases .",
    "we also discussed a biophysical implication of the transition , namely the heterogeneity in the growth rates of bacterial cells and the phenomena of persistence , arguing that a bistability of dynamical phases can be found in even the simplest models of a cell cycle which lack an explicit bistability in configuration space .",
    "our study of a single - particle system reveals one simple manner in which dynamical phase transitions can arise .",
    "the two dynamical phases are time independent , a characteristic of the transition shared by some many - particle systems  @xcite , but the model certainly does not encompass the full range of dynamical complexity intrinsic to interacting nonlinear degrees of freedom .",
    "this work thus does not directly help to clarify , for instance , rare phases related to the hydrodynamic limit of many - particle dynamics  @xcite",

    "the heterogeneous link requires that we also introduce transfer matrices @xmath119 and @xmath120 given by @xmath121 because the network is arranged in a ring , propagations around the full loop must map @xmath122 onto itself , such that the transfer matrices must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath123 which requires that @xmath124 posses a unit eigenvalue in the @xmath125 limit .",
