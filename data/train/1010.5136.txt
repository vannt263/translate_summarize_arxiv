    "the emergence of electronic trading as a major means of trading financial assets makes the study of the order book central to understanding the mechanisms of price formation . in order - driven markets ,",
    "buy and sell orders are matched continuously subject to price and time priority .",
    "the _ order book _ is the list of all buy and sell limit orders , with their corresponding price and size , at a given instant of time .",
    "essentially , three types of orders can be submitted :    * _ limit order _ : specify a price ( also called `` quote '' ) at which one is willing to buy or sell a certain number of shares ; * _ market order _ : immediately buy or sell a certain number of shares at the best available opposite quote ; * _ cancellation order _ : cancel an existing limit order .    in the econophysics literature ,",
    "`` agents '' who submit exclusively limit orders are referred to as _",
    "liquidity providers_. those who submit market orders are referred to as _ liquidity takers_.",
    "limit orders are stored in the order book until they are either executed against an incoming market order or canceled .",
    "the _ ask _ price @xmath0 ( or simply the ask ) is the price of the best ( i.e. lowest ) limit sell order .",
    "the _ bid _",
    "price @xmath1 is the price of the best ( i.e. highest ) limit buy order .",
    "the gap between the bid and the ask @xmath2 is always positive and is called the _",
    "spread_. prices are not continuous , but rather have a discrete resolution @xmath3 , the _ tick _ , which represents the smallest quantity by which they can change .",
    "we define the _ mid - price _ as the average between the bid and the ask @xmath4    the price dynamics is the result of the interplay between the incoming order flow and the order book @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] is a schematic illustration of this process @xcite .",
    "note that we chose to represent quantities on the bid side of the book by non - positive numbers .",
    "although in reality orders can have any size , we shall assume throughout this paper that all orders have a fixed unit size @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption is convenient to carry out our analysis and is , for now , of secondary importance to the problem we are interested in .",
    "we start with the simplest agent - based market model :    * the order book starts in a full state : all limits above @xmath6 and below @xmath7 are filled with one limit order of unit size @xmath5 .",
    "the spread starts equal to 1 tick ; * the flow of market orders is modeled by two independent poisson processes @xmath8 ( buy orders ) and @xmath9 ( sell orders ) with constant arrival rates ( or intensities ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; * there is one liquidity provider , who reacts immediately after a market order arrives so as to maintain the spread constantly equal to 1 tick .",
    "he places a limit order on the same side as the market order ( i.e. a buy limit order after a buy market order and vice versa ) with probability @xmath12 and on the opposite side with probability @xmath13 .",
    "the mid - price dynamics can be written in the following form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a bernoulli random variable @xmath16 the infinitesimal generator is the operator @xmath17 , if exists , defined to act on sufficiently regular functions @xmath18 , by @xmath19 - f(\\mathbf{x})}{t}.\\ ] ] it provides an analytical tool to study @xmath20 @xcite . ]",
    "associated with this dynamics is @xmath21 it is well known that a continuous limit is obtained under suitable assumptions on the intensity and tick size . noting that can be rewritten as @xmath22 and under the following assumptions @xmath23 the generator converges to the classical diffusion operator @xmath24 corresponding to a brownian motion with drift .",
    "this simple case is worked out as an example of the type of limit theorems that we will be interested in in the sequel .",
    "one should also note that a more classical approach using the functional central limit theorem ( fclt ) as in @xcite or @xcite yields similar results ; for given fixed values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath3 , the rescaled - centered price process @xmath25 converges as @xmath26 , to a standard brownian motion @xmath27 where @xmath28 let us mention that one can easily achieve more complex diffusive limits such as a local volatility model by imposing that the limit is a function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 this would be the case if the original intensities are functions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 themselves .",
    "we now consider the dynamics of a general order book under a poisson type assumption for the arrival of new market orders , limit orders and cancellations .",
    "we shall assume that each side of the order book is fully described by a _",
    "finite _ number of limits @xmath32 , ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath32 ticks away from the best available opposite quote .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath34 where @xmath35 designates the ask side of the order book and @xmath36 the number of shares available at price level @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath37 ticks away from the best opposite quote ) , and @xmath38 designates the bid side of the book . by doing so , we adopt the representation described e.g. in @xcite or @xcite , but depart slightly from it by adopting a _ finite moving frame _ , as we think it is realistic and more convenient when scaling in tick size will be addressed .",
    "let us now recall the events that may happen :    * arrival of a new market order ; * arrival of a new limit order ; * cancellation of an already existing limit order .",
    "these events are described by _",
    "independent _ poisson processes :    * @xmath39 : arrival of new market order , with intensity @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; * @xmath42 : arrival of a limit order at level @xmath37 , with intensity @xmath43 ; * @xmath44 : cancellation of a limit order at level @xmath37 , with intensity @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath5 is the size of any new incoming order , and the superscript `` @xmath47 '' ( respectively `` @xmath48 '' ) refers to the ask ( respectively bid ) side of the book .",
    "note that the intensity of the cancellation process at level @xmath37 is proportional to the available quantity at that level . that is to say , each order at level @xmath37 has a lifetime drawn from an exponential distribution with intensity @xmath49 .",
    "note also that buy limit orders @xmath50 arrive below the ask price @xmath51 , and sell limit orders @xmath52 arrive above the bid price @xmath53 .",
    "we impose constant boundary conditions outside the moving frame of size @xmath54 : every time the moving frame leaves a price level , the number of shares at that level is set to @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 depending on the side of the book ) .",
    "our choice of a finite moving frame and constant and @xmath57 independent positive random variables would not change much our analysis .",
    "we take constants for simplicity . ]",
    "boundary conditions has three motivations .",
    "firstly , it assures that the order book does not empty and that @xmath0 , @xmath1 are always well defined .",
    "secondly , it keeps the spread @xmath58 and the increments of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath59 bounded  this will be important when addressing the diffusive limit of the price .",
    "thirdly , it makes the model markovian as we do not keep track of the price levels that have been visited ( then left ) by the moving frame at some prior time .",

    "order book dynamics : in this example , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 . the shape of the order book is such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "note the coupling of the two sides : the shifts on the @xmath86 s depend on the @xmath87 s , and vice versa .",
    "more precisely the shifts depend on the profile of the order book on the other side , namely the cumulative depth up to level @xmath37 defined by @xmath88 and the generalized inverse functions thereof @xmath89 where @xmath90 designates a certain quantity of shares .",
