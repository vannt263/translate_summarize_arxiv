    "one of the most exciting results to have emerged from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , is the large energy loss of high transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) partons in the strongly interacting partonic matter created in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the fraction of energy transferred from the parton to the medium is expected to depend on the gluon densities and the spacio - temporal extent of the interaction @xcite .",
    "therefore , jet energy loss is considered a promising tool to obtain a tomographic image of the partonic medium .",
    "equally important is the medium excitation resulting from the energy transfer , since it may carry information on the transport properties of bulk qcd matter @xcite .",
    "azimuthal angular correlation measurements at intermediate @xmath2 reveal two off - center away - side peaks at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these structures are generally attributed to the medium response to jets .",
    "several possible mechanistic scenarios are being actively debated . at the center of",
    "the discussion is the creation of jet induced mach shocks @xcite .",
    "mach cones can provide information on the speed of sound ( @xmath3 ) of strongly interacting partonic matter and are expected to be sensitive to the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density ( @xmath4 ) . an important prerequisite to extracting medium properties from the data , however , is a solid understanding of the mechanistic details involved .",
    "despite much recent progress , such an understanding has not yet been achieved .",
    "two important outstanding questions are wether conical emission patterns do indeed exist in the data and how the underlying flow field may influence the observed correlation structures .",
    "three - particle correlation analyses provide added topological insights over and above the information content carried by two particle correlations .",
    "the phenix collaboration has measured the correlation of two charged hadrons at @xmath5 gev / c associated with a trigger hadron at @xmath6 gev / c in au+au collisions at @xmath7 gev . to this end",
    ", a coordinate system is defined for which the trigger particle orientation denotes the z - axis @xcite . to the degree that the trigger particle approximates the jet axis , this coordinate system is somewhat more natural to the investigated problem than the laboratory frame .",
    "figure [ fi:1 ] shows the resulting azimuthal and radial projections of the two dimensional correlation function for a centrality selection corresponding to 20 - 30% of the geometric cross - section .",
    "the flow modulated background and the contributions from two - particle correlations have been subtracted following the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "the data ( filled triangles ) is compared to toy monte carlo simulations of cone jets ( filled squares ) and bent jets ( filled circles ) . for the latter case ,",
    "the away - side jets have been displaced in azimuth to reproduce the signal in the two - particle correlation data .",
    "the comparison indicates , that the observed correlation structures are consistent with expectations from conical emission patterns .",
    "an interplay of other contributions to the three - particle correlation , however , can not be ruled out .",

    "an analysis relative to the event - plane was carried out .",
    "jet energy loss depends on the initial gluon densities and the distance travelled by the partons in the medium @xcite .",
    "similarly , the medium response to the energy transfer is expected to depend on the amount of matter that can be excited and the direction of the parton with respect to the flow field .",
    "therefore , angular correlations relative to the reaction geometry hold much promise to disentangle energy loss from medium excitation effects",
    ". they can also serve to tightly constrain medium modification models . to this end , we report relative azimuthal angle correlations of charged hadrons in the range 1.0@xmath92.0 gev / c associated with a trigger hadron at 2.0@xmath93.0 gev / c , that has been oriented with respect to the event plane . the shape and yield of jet - induced correlations for both the near- and away - side jets are then studied as a function of the relative azimuthal angle between the trigger particle and the event plane ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the analysis follows the techniques outlined in refs .",
    "a newly installed reaction plane detector allows for the reconstruction of the event plane with excellent resolution ( @xmath11 in mid - central collisions ) .",

    "[ fi:2 ] left ) , the three jet pair distributions are essentially identical within the stated uncertainties .",
    "this is to be expected , since central events do not result in strong reaction plane dependent path length changes .",
    "all three distributions show a broad away - side peak that exhibits a minimum at @xmath17 and a maximum at @xmath18 , in accordance with earlier inclusive correlation measurements @xcite .    for the mid - central selection ( fig .",
    "[ fi:2 ] right ) , the away - side peak for the in - plane trigger orientation and the out - of - plane trigger orientation both appear to have similar width .",
    "however , the head region at @xmath0 seems to be suppressed in the out - of - plane direction , while the distribution for the in - plane trigger particle still shows a sizable yield at @xmath19 this observation is in qualitative agreement with expectations from jet suppression . for a di - jet system that is aligned with the short axis of the overlap region ( in - plane ) ,",
    "very little jet quenching is expected . by contrast , a jet opposite a trigger particle pointing perpendicular to the event plane has a larger path length through the medium and is thus more likely to be quenched .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the jet pair distribution for a trigger particle oriented at @xmath20 shows a much broader away - side than its in - plane and out - of - plane counterparts .",
    "the yield is depleted at @xmath21 , but now shows an enhancement away from @xmath17 which peaks at @xmath22 . at present ,",
    "it is unclear whether this merely reflects a geometry dependent shift in the away - side peaks or perhaps an additional contribution at @xmath23 .",

    "the region directly opposite the trigger particle spanning @xmath24 , which we will call the `` head '' region and a `` shoulder '' region identified by @xmath25 .",

    "this is in agreement with qualitative expectations from jet - quenching models , since the path - length opposite the trigger particle increases in the same direction .",
    "by contrast , the shoulder yields increase from in - plane to reach a maximum at about @xmath27 .",
    "they fall again to reach a value for the out - of - plane yield that is comparable to the in - plane case .",
    "the correlation structures in the head region have predominantly been attributed to jet energy loss and the correlation signals in the shoulder region are generally interpreted as arising mostly from the medium s response to this energy loss . in such a picture ,",
