    "if we trace out a mode from a multipartite gaussian state , the reduced state is also gaussian  @xcite .",
    "recently , the problem of preparing pure gaussian states has been studied in the literature  @xcite .",

    "this is also known in the field of quantum information , where a quantum state can be characterized via a set of operators known as nullifiers  @xcite .    for general reservoir engineering problems including the above - mentioned gaussian case ,",
    "a common question is how to practically construct the system operators @xmath5 satisfying the requirements to realize the desired dissipation for a large number of modes .",
    "one such construction is the so - called _ quasi - local _ system - reservoir interaction , which requires only a few system components interacting with the reservoir  @xcite . on the other hand , realization with the _ cascade connection _",
    "has been investigated in  @xcite ; in this case _ all _ the system components interact with the reservoir fields in a one - way fashion ; see also  @xcite .",
    "a clear advantage of this construction is that the subsystems can be placed at far away sites , which as a result yield a quantum communication channel .",

    "our result is that any pure gaussian state can be generated by engineering a cascade of one - dimensional open quantum harmonic oscillators , without any direct interaction hamiltonians between these oscillators .",
