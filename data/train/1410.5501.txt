    "one decade has gone by since the earlier groundbreaking experiments performed by andrei geim and konstantin novoselov  @xcite ( nobel laureates in physics in 2010 ) to isolate single layer membranes of graphite , graphene .",
    "soon after , theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite groups highlighted the properties of charge carriers in this material which resemble much to ultrarelativistic electrons , thus establishing a bridge between solid state and particle physics ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "graphene has given rise to the new era of dirac materials with potential applications in nanotechnology , but also offering an opportunity to test the core of fundamental physics in a condensed matter environment .",
    "mechanical , thermal and electronic properties of this two - dimensional crystal locate it among the best candidates to replace silicon in nanotechnological devices , basically due to its hardness , yet flexibility , high electron mobility and thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
    "crystal structure of graphene consists in a honeycomb array of tightly packed carbon atoms , thus allowing an accurate tight - binding description . at low energies ,",
    "such a description becomes in the continuous limit the lagrangian of massless quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , qed@xmath7 , for the charge carriers restricted to move along the membrane  @xcite , but in which the `` photon '' is allowed to move throughout space in such a way that the static coulomb interaction is still described by a potential that varies as the inverse of the distance on the plane of motion of electrons . in this form ,",
    "low - energy dynamics of graphene is in accordance with the spirit of brane - world scenarios of fundamental interactions ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) where the gauge field ( photon ) is allowed to move throughout the bulk ( full space ) , but matter fields are restricted to a brane ( the graphene layer ) .",
    "expectedly , quantum field theoretical methods have been developed to describe phenomena in graphene which have been theorized in the high energy physics realm , but that would appear enhanced in this material due to the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum and the fermi velocity of its charge carriers , @xmath8 .",
    "theoretical objects like the effective action in external electromagnetic fields have been calculated by several authors in connection with the schwinger mechanism for pair production and the issue of minimal conductivity  @xcite , ideas that have been generalized to the multilayer case  @xcite .",
    "other `` relativistic '' effects discussed in literature include the klein paradox  @xcite , casimir effect  @xcite and the dynamical formation of a mass gap from excitonic condensates  @xcite .",
    "graphene properties have been handled also from the perspective of non - conmutative quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of graphene is the visual transparency of the membranes .",
    "its opacity has been measured  @xcite to be roughly 2.3% with almost negligible reflectance .",
    "this observation has opened the possibility of using single layers of this crystal in combination with bio - materials to produce clean hydrogen by photocatalysis  @xcite with visible light .",
    "the problem of light absorption in graphene can be addressed from quantum field theoretical methods  @xcite .",
    "several authors have considered the dirac picture for its charge carriers in terms of the degrees of freedom of qed@xmath7 under different assumptions .",
    "parity violating effects were considered in  @xcite , whereas the influence of a strong magnetic field was considered in  @xcite in connection with the faraday effect .",
    "measurements of magneto - optical properties of epitaxial graphene have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular the polarization rotation and light absorption . results seem to be in accordance with the `` relativistic '' behavior of charge carriers for a range of values of the external magnetic field intensity between 0.5  -  7  t  @xcite . for the discussion of these results , the structure of the vacuum polarization tensor is the cornerstone",
    ". this operator has been calculated by several authors in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicularly aligned with the graphene membrane  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we continue the discussion but in our considerations , the external magnetic field is weak in intensity as compared to the effective mass @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the fermi momentum and fermi velocity of charge carriers .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we start modeling the low - energy behavior of graphene from massless qed@xmath7 subjected to an external magnetic field perpendicular to the membrane , namely , we consider the full space , but restrict the dynamics of charge carriers in graphene to an infinite plane where the third spatial component is set to zero . expanding the quasiparticle propagator in the weak field regime , we calculate the vacuum polarization tensor to the leading order in the external field intensity in sect .",

    ", we introduce the polarization operator in the modified maxwell s equation to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in space . from the matching conditions , we calculate the transmission coefficient and from there , the intensity of transmitted light and angle of polarization rotation in terms of the longitudinal and transverse conductivities , which we derive from ohm s law .",
    "our results correspond to the weak field faraday effect .",
    "we discuss our findings and conclude in sect .",
    "some details of the calculation of the polarization tensor are presented in an appendix .",
