    "few analytical methods can handle systems with quenched disorder beyond mean field and phenomenological arguments , and each seems adapted only to a specific class of models .",

    "disordered systems in @xmath11 can sometimes be studied using methods inspired by conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "exact results were obtained for free fermions with disorder of various symmetries using bozonisation and supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the physics there is localization , and in recently much studied symmetry classes , de - localization near a point where the density of state ( dos ) is singular ( e.g. bipartite lattices leading to dirac fermions ) .",
    "there , sample ( and local dos ) fluctuations can become broad leading to freezing transitions in the dos dynamical exponent @xmath12 , @xmath13 , as found for dirac fermions with random vector potential @xcite .",
    "being equivalent to a ( dilute ) limit of a random gauge xy spin model it exhibits an infinite set of relevant operators @xcite which can be handled using _ another _ functional rg method @xcite based on the kpp - fisher equation ( hence noted here kpp - frg ) .",

    "the model ( [ def_co ] ) exhibits a super - rough phase for @xmath27 with anomalous growth of the 2-point correlation @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes thermal averages .",
    "this is in contrast with the usual logarithmic roughness for @xmath30 , disorder being irrelevant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath31 .",
    "the sts symmetry implies that @xmath32 is uncorrected by disorder and does not flow under rg .",

    "the line of fp can be reached near @xmath33 by perturbative one loop rg which predicts @xcite : @xmath36 in agreement with precise numerics @xcite . at low temperature ,",
    "only numerical results are available at present : it was concluded from exact ground state determinations @xcite for a closely related solid on solid model that super - roughening holds at @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 ( see below ) .",
    "a recent study @xcite of a free fermion model opened hope that @xmath39 could be obtained exactly .",

    "then the bosonic action @xmath45={\\cal s}_{\\rm co}[u=2 \\phi]$ ] , where one substitutes @xmath46 in ( [ def_co ] ) , is the euclidean action ( with @xmath47}$ ] ) of the bozonized form of the fermion model ( with @xmath48}$ ] ) of euclidean action @xmath49 with : @xmath50 + \\frac{1}{\\hbar } \\int_\\tau h_0 \\\\ & & h_0 = \\int_x   \\hbar v_f : \\psi_l^\\dagger ( i \\partial_x -k_f ) \\psi_l - \\psi_r^\\dagger ( i \\partial_x + k_f ) \\psi_r : \\nonumber \\\\ & & s_{int } = \\frac{1}{\\hbar } \\int_{x \\tau } \\frac{g_4}{2 } ( \\rho_r \\rho_r + \\rho_l \\rho_l ) + g_2 \\rho_r \\rho_l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the fermion density and @xmath54 are ( spinless ) fermion interaction parameters with @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",

    "next , the ( formal ) perturbation of the fermion model @xmath70 with @xmath71 by a small ( dynamic ) random potential @xmath72 ( neglecting for now higher harmonics ) is equivalent via @xmath65=s_{co}[u=2 \\phi]$ ] , to the disorder pertubation in the co model , i.e @xmath73 in ( [ def_co ] ) .",
    "the correspondance reads @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "an isotropic @xmath77 distribution is obtained by coupling a random field to @xmath78 but it makes no difference at large scale . for @xmath79 small disorder @xmath80 is relevant and grows under rg to finite value on the fixed line @xcite . at a naive level ( see below ) the relation ( [ kvst ] ) still holds since being unrenormalized ( for exact sts ) .      the recent study @xcite adresses a _ free fermion _ model in presence of ( isotropic ) disorder @xmath81 .",

    "this model was also found to be described by a line of fp with the exact result ( denoting @xmath89 and @xmath90 the same bosonic phase as above ) : @xmath91 for real copies @xmath92 of the model ( no replica ) .",
    "the vanishing beta function for @xmath93 strongly suggests that the free fermion model is exactly _ on the co fixed line_. from the above it means that the value of @xmath67 is shifted from @xmath94 ( no disorder ) down to @xmath95 ( in presence of disorder ) , to all orders in @xmath93 according to ref .  @xcite .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath93 one easily finds such a shift on model @xmath96 , e.g. considering the replicated action @xmath97-\\frac{1}{2 \\pi^2 } \\int_{x \\tau } ( g_m o_m + g_a o_a ) \\\\ & & o_m=\\tilde \\psi^\\dagger_{ra } \\tilde \\psi_{la } \\tilde \\psi^\\dagger_{lb } \\tilde \\psi_{rb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while bosonization of the terms @xmath98 yields the @xmath99 disorder terms of the replicated co action ( see [ bare_action_2 ] below ) , the @xmath100 term yields an interaction @xcite as in eq .",

    "the reentrant shape of the @xmath119 is surprising as one expects stronger effect of disorder at low @xmath1 .",
    "this is reminiscent of reentrant phase boundaries found in the random gauge xy model , due to neglecting operators ( moments of vortex fugacity ) which become relevant at low @xmath1 @xcite . here",
    "higher harmonics of the @xmath120 field are known to be generated as an interplay of interactions and disorder .",
    "this can be seen in the haldane representation @xcite : @xmath121 which yields higher harmonics @xmath122 in ( [ bare_action_2 ] ) .",

    "weak disorder counting shows them to be irrelevant for @xmath128 but these dimensions could change along the fixed line well before that .",
    "we now study the effect of higher harmonics using the frg .",
