    "the electron spins in the host gaas semiconductor are coupled with the ensemble of nuclear spins mainly through the hyperfine ( hf ) interaction .",
    "the hf interaction lies at the heart of many fascinating phenomena including dynamic nuclear polarization , knight shift , and overhauser / hyperfine field@xcite , and is of importance to development of quantum computing based on hybrid ensemble of electron - nuclear spins .",
    "the interaction has been successfully utilized to probe and characterize various electron spin cooperative phenomena in 2d systems subjected to a strong magnetic field @xmath1 at low temperature , where the strong coulomb interaction dominates the physics .",
    "examples include evidence for the formation of a topological spin texture near a landau level filling factor of @xmath2 as predicted by shondhi _ et.al _ @xcite via the knight shift@xcite , and nuclear spin relaxation @xmath3 time measurements@xcite .",
    "recently an canted antiferromagnetic state in a bilayer total filling factor @xmath0 that supports linearly dispersing goldstone modes@xcite was experimentally verified by kumada _ et.al _ who used the knight shift@xcite and @xmath3 measurements@xcite .",
    "a large portion of research has been devoted to the use of nuclear spins as a mere tool for studying electronic structures in quantum hall systems , whereas little attention has been given as to how the electronic structures affect the nuclear spin .",
    "in fact , cooperative phenomena coming from an ensemble of nuclear spins induced by the hf interaction could lead to various interesting features including nuclear spin helix in 1d system@xcite very recently observed in gaas quantum wires@xcite , or nuclear superradiance like effect in quantum dots@xcite . yet to the best of our knowledge , the hf induced superradiance effect has not been observed to date .",
    "one of the strongest cooperative phenomena involving electron spins appears in a bilayer canted antiferromagnetic ( caf ) state as evidenced by its very short nuclear spin relaxation @xmath3 time@xcite .",
    "therefore , we expected there would be cooperative phenomena that could produce superradiance like effect when an ensemble of nuclear spins interacts selectively with the caf state .    in this study , we developed a nuclear magnetometry and used it to demonstrate the possibility of collective nuclear spins relaxation due to interaction with the goldstone mode of the caf phase of total filling factor of @xmath0 in the quantum hall effect .",
    "we found that the initial number of polarized nuclear spins would affect the relaxation behaviour . a pump - probe technique performed at the spin transition at the filling factor of @xmath4",
    "was employed to dynamically polarize the nuclear spins and probe their relaxation dynamics@xcite .",
    "we analyze the position of the spin transition to estimate the hyperfine field value and its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) to qualitatively discuss the homogeneity of nuclear spin polarization in the well .",
    "in the composite fermion ( cf ) model , the filling factor @xmath4 corresponds to integer filling factor @xmath5 of cf , the two cf landau levels are fully occupied below the fermi energy @xmath6 .",
    "the cf particle comprises of one electron with two attached magnetic flux quanta@xcite .",
    "consequently , the cfs experience a reduced magnetic field , which in mean field approximation , is given by    @xmath7    therefore an effective magnetic field experienced by the cfs at @xmath4 is @xmath8 .",
    "similar to the normal landau level , the cfs energy spectrum is also quantized into a series cf landau levels .",
    "each cf landau levels is separated by    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the composite fermion effective mass @xcite . due to the zeeman effect ,",
    "each cf landau levels further splits into two spin sublevels separated by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the levels @xmath14 and @xmath15 can cross each other at certain range of magnetic field @xmath1 when the zeeman energy equals to the cf cyclotron energy gap ( see fig .",
    "the electronic system at the transition experiences a first - order spin transition from a spin - unpolarized ( @xmath16 ) to a spin - polarized ( @xmath17 ) ground state ( see fig .",
    "1b ) as the magnetic field increases above a critical field @xmath18 .",
    "coexistence of two electron spin domains ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) at the transition point has been uncovered through magnetotransport experiments@xcite , nmr spectroscopy@xcite , as well as from microscopic standpoint@xcite .",
    "the field crossing at the spin transition is given by    @xmath19    @xmath20    for example assuming @xmath21 , which is comparable to the theoretical value reported in ref@xcite , yield @xmath22 t.    now let s discuss the influence of nuclear spin polarization to the spin transition .",
    "gaas has three isotopes namely @xmath23ga , @xmath24ga , and @xmath25as with angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "the interaction between an electron and nuclear spins in gaas is mainly through the contact hyperfine interaction described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath27    here @xmath28 is the hyperfine coupling constant .",
    "the first term describes the dynamical process between an electron spin and nuclear spin including dynamic nuclear polarization and nuclear polarization decay .",
    "the second term describes the influence of static hyperfine field @xmath29 produced by an ensemble of nuclear polarization on the electronic zeeman energy .    @xmath30    accordingly ,",
    "the field crossing at the spin transition in the presence of the hyperfine field @xmath31 is    @xmath32    from equation ( 7 ) , one can estimate the hyperfine field @xmath31 by monitoring the field crossing @xmath18 as demonstrated in ref@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can also estimate @xmath31 from the spin transition peak position with fixed magnetic field by sweeping the gate voltage ( electron density ) across the transition .",
    "in fact , a tiny amount of the nuclear polarization down to @xmath33 thermal equilibrium nuclear polarization can be detected sensitively by this spin transition@xcite .",
    "experiments were carried out on a high - quality 20-nm - wide bilayer gaas quantum well separated by a 2.2 nm al@xmath34ga@xmath35as barrier .",
    "the energy separation of the symmetric and antisymmetric states , @xmath36 , was @xmath37 k at the charge balanced condition for a total electron density of @xmath38 m@xmath39 .",
    "the sample was patterned into a @xmath40-@xmath41m - wide hall bar , and ohmic contact pads were made with ni / auge / ni alloys annealed at @xmath42 c. the carrier density of the top and bottom layers ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) could be controlled independently from depletion to @xmath45 m@xmath39 by applying bias voltages to the top gate made of a ti / au electrode deposited on top of the hall bar and the @xmath46-gaas substrate acting as the bottom gate . at a constant magnetic field @xmath1 ,",
    "the filling factor was tuned by controlling the carrier density in each layer .",
    "the total filling factor @xmath47 is the sum of the individual filling factors .",
    "all magnetotransport measurements were carried out using a lock - in technique at @xmath48 hz and the sample was immersed in a mixture of he-3/he-4 .",
    "the key aspect of our experimental protocol is schematically displayed in fig .",
    "first , the carrier density in one layer ( bottom layer ) was set to the spin transition at the filling factor of @xmath4 at constant top @xmath49 v and bottom gate bias voltages @xmath50 v , and a constant magnetic field of @xmath51 t. a high excitation current @xmath52 na was applied for @xmath53 sec ( unless mentioned otherwise ) to induce dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) .",
    "at the spin transition , the energy mismatches between electron and nuclear spin is reduced which allows them to couple effectively .",
    "the nuclear spin can be dynamically polarized effectively by the @xmath52 na current flow because when an electron spin scatters across two different domains , it does so by flipping a nuclear spin around the domain boundary to preserve total angular momentum . the spin transition profile before and after dynamic polarization",
    "were readout as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , as displayed in fig .",
    "2(b ) . spatial inhomogeneous nuclear spin polarization enhanced and broadened the spin transition peak .",
    "the enhancement to the left of the peak ( @xmath56 ) is attributed to the upward nuclear spin polarization @xmath57 and the right one ( @xmath58 ) is attributed to the @xmath59 as schematically shown in fig .",
    "next , the carrier density was tuned in both layers to reach the quantum hall state with @xmath60 for several sets of charge imbalance variables , @xmath61 .",
    "the excitation current @xmath62 was turned off at this sequence .",
    "the polarized nuclear spins then interact with electrons of the bilayer with @xmath0 .",
    "we interrupted the process by temporarily restoring the filling factor to a one layer ( the bottom layer ) @xmath63 after a given interval of time `` exposure time @xmath64 '' and the remaining nuclear polarization was readout as @xmath65 ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ) by sweeping the filling factor across @xmath63 ( @xmath66 ) by varying the gate bias voltages at a measurement current @xmath62 of @xmath67 na .",
    "note that with this measurement current level , dnp is negligible .",
    "the top gate voltage sweep rate was @xmath68 s@xmath69 at constant bottom gate voltage @xmath50 .",
    "the sweep time from @xmath70(@xmath71 ) to @xmath72(@xmath73 ) was about @xmath74 seconds and much faster than the nuclear spin relaxation time at @xmath4 ( @xmath75 seconds ) . the remaining nuclear polarization is reflected in the readout spin transition profile @xmath65 .",
    "an example of complete measurement sequences is given in fig .",
    "2(d ) for charge imbalance @xmath76 where the resistance to the left and the right of the peak gradually decreased almost at the same rate towards its equilibrium shape . fig .",
    "2(e ) shows a simplified situation in which both @xmath57 and @xmath59 are depolarized equably .",
    "we will show you in the next section that this picture is no longer valid when an ensemble of nuclear spins interacts with the caf state .",
    "figure 3(a ) depicts a two - dimensional map of the longitudinal resistance @xmath77 highlighted along @xmath0 as a function of the top- and the bottom - gate voltages at @xmath78 t and @xmath79 mk .",
    "the phase transition between different magnetic state along the @xmath0 was driven by altering the normalized density imbalance @xmath80@xcite .",
    "the quantum hall effect was preserved from the point of no charge imbalance @xmath81 , where the system possessed a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , to a very large charge imbalance @xmath82 , where the spin configuration altered to a spin singlet ( ss ) state when the tunneling gap @xmath36 overwhelmed the zeeman energy @xmath83@xcite .",
    "level crossing did not take place because the transition from fm to ss phases occured through two second - order phase transition via an intermediate state , namely the canted antiferromagnetic ( caf ) state@xcite .    according to ref@xcite",
    ", the lowest dispersion energy for ferromagnetic , canted , and spin singlet can be calculated analytically by the following equations    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    here @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are intra - layer stiffness , inter - layer stiffness , inter - layer coulomb energy and exchange energy , respectively , with the explicit formula is given in ref@xcite .",
    "the dispersion curve near @xmath91 for those three different states is displayed in fig .",
    "it is clear that the caf state is the only gapless mode and it has a linear dispersion curve near @xmath91 , while the other two states have non zero excitation gap at @xmath91 with @xmath92 k , and @xmath93 k.    now let us analyze the nuclear spin relaxation due to interactions with the electrons of the bilayer @xmath0 . in the ss state depicted in fig .",
    "4(c ) , the time required to reach the equilibrium spin transition shape , @xmath94 , is very long ( @xmath95 sec ) .",
    "in addition , the way that the spin transition curve relaxes is qualitatively quite similar to our expected relaxation behavior in fig .",
    "this is not surprising since the nuclear subsystem is well isolated from the electronic system , the nuclear zeeman energy ( @xmath96 mhz ) is several order of magnitude that the excitation gap of the ss state .",
    "it is therefore reasonable that the exchanges of energy and angular momentum are very inefficient and the ss state can not contribute much to the nuclear spin relaxation process .",
    "the relaxation channel is mainly governed by nuclear spin diffusion . for the fm state shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the measured @xmath94 was @xmath97 sec , which is almost ten times faster than in the ss state .",
    "the shape of the spin transition towards equilibrium revealed that it was rather distinct from the previous one measured in the ss state .",
    "the curve s fall was asymmetrically ; that is the resistance to the right of the peak , corresponding to @xmath58 , dropped more than it did on the left .",
    "the most striking feature of the nuclear spin relaxation process was observed in the caf state depicted in fig .",
    "first of all , the @xmath94 was very short , @xmath98 sec .",
    "this indicates the appearance of electron spin fluctuations which have a high spectral density at the larmor nuclear frequencies of ga and as@xcite ; this is suggestive of the linearly dispersion goldstone mode as displayed in fig .",
    "what makes the relaxation process even more interesting is that the initial characteristics of the dnp completely disappeared one second after exposure to the caf state .",
    "the broad transition curve suddenly became very narrow .",
    "the resistance to the right of the peak dropped to almost zero because the downward nuclear spin polarization , which is higher in energy than the upward one , completely relaxed .",
    "the spin transition curve moved rapidly back to equilibrium by shifting back to a higher filling factor at @xmath99 within @xmath100 seconds , while its width remained narrow during the evolution . the observed response clearly indicated a sudden change in the nuclear spin polarization distribution after one second of interaction with the caf state . from the peak shifting and matching condition between the zeeman and coulomb energy scales@xcite",
    ", we can estimate the hyperfine field @xmath31 from the remaining nuclear spin polarization one second after exposure to the caf state .",
    "the estimated @xmath101 is approximately @xmath102 t. it roughly corresponds to a @xmath103 spatially homogeneous nuclear spin polarization , assuming that if all gaas nuclear spins were fully polarized , the hyperfine field would be as high as @xmath104 t@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath105 t is where the filling factor of the spin transition approximately coincided with the transition at @xmath106 t one second after exposure to the caf state ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) .    to get further insight into a sudden redistribution of the nuclear spins ensemble due to interaction with the caf state for @xmath107 second",
    ", we carried out the experimental procedure described in fig .",
    "the procedure in principle was carried out similarly to the previous procedure in fig .",
    "the only difference was that after readout sequence @xmath108 finished , instead of setting the total filling factor back to @xmath0 again , we depleted the electrons in each layer for a given interval of time before the next readout sequence ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 , ... , @xmath65 ) was started .",
    "each layer was completely depleted by applying @xmath111 volt to the top gate and @xmath112 volt to the bottom gate . apparently , the evolution of the spin transition shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) after depletion followed much the same way as in fig .",
    "4(b ) , however , with a longer time scale of about two order of magnitude slower to reach equilibrium .",
    "the result suggests that the redistribution is solely due to interaction with the caf state .",
    "another interesting point is that we could keep the remaining homogeneous nuclear polarization for a significant time period ( about @xmath53 seconds ) by just depleting the electrons in each layer one second after exposure to the caf state .",
    "let us elaborate on how the response changes when we decrease the current pumping time from @xmath113 seconds .",
    "the number of polarized nuclear spins would decrease as a result of shortening the current pumping time .",
    "for all of the data presented in fig .",
    "6 , the exposure time to the caf state with @xmath114 was fixed to @xmath107 second .",
    "evidently , the response in terms of the spin transition s position and width showed a dependence on the current pumping time . the largest shift in the spin transition s position with respect to the equilibrium position ( @xmath99 ) appeared at @xmath113 seconds , and it decayed with decreasing polarization time ( see the black arrows in fig .",
    "interestingly as depicted in figure 6(b ) , its width had the opposite tendency ; i.e. , its value peaked at the shortest polarization time and became narrower with increasing polarization time .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath115 seconds , the downward nuclear spin polarization did not completely relax",
    ".    the observed response might be the fingerprint of an emission due to a collective nuclear spin relaxation , in analogy with superradiance emission in quantum optics@xcite .",
    "the possibility of observing superradiance emissions from an ensemble of nuclear spins in a magnetic field was first put forward by bloembergen and pound@xcite and experimentally observed by kiselev _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the motions of the inverted polarized nuclear spins can become highly correlated when the resonance circuit frequency matches the larmor frequency of nuclei .",
    "indeed , the present system is fundamentally different than the one studied by bloembergen and kiselev _",
    "et al_. in our case the nuclear spins interact mainly with the electron spins via the hf coupling but not with the resonance circuit as in their case .",
    "indeed nuclear superradiance could also induced via the hf coupling as pointed out in ref@xcite .",
    "this type of superradiance effect needs several prerequisite conditions below that can be satisfied in our case :    1 .",
    "a strong hf coupling is needed and it has to be much stronger than the nuclear dipolar coupling . for gaas case , the hf coupling strength is about @xmath116 @xmath41ev@xcite which is several order of magnitude larger than that of the nuclear dipolar coupling .",
    "2 .   it requires direct flip - flop process as described in the first term of equation ( 5 ) . at high magnetic field",
    ", the angular momentum exchange is usually impeded due to large electronic zeeman energy .",
    "however , this requirement is easily met for the caf state since it has gapless excitation energy at @xmath91 .",
    "3 .   electrons have to be strongly correlated .",
    "in fact , the coherence length of the goldstone mode is very long and hence could satisfy the requirement .",
    "lastly we need to stress that although the goldstone mode has continuous energy dispersion , it has a strong spectral density at the larmor frequency of ga and as nuclear species as evidence by a very short @xmath3 time .",
    "the detailed spin transition curve @xmath107 second after the exposure could help us to identify the presence of special electronic states associated with broken planar symmetry .",
    "figure 7 illustrates the nuclear relaxation process for a certain range of temperatures and/or charge imbalances and plots the extracted fwhm .",
    "the characteristic response associated with the caf state for @xmath117 disappeared upon increasing the sample temperature from @xmath79 to @xmath118 mk ( see fig .",
    "7(a)(b ) ) .",
    "the spin transition curve noticeably became very broad for a @xmath107 second exposure . this could be interpreted as possibly a straightforward signature of the transition between the caf and ss phases .",
    "the long - ranged ordering was destroyed , resulting in incoherent coupling between the nuclear and electron spins .",
    "we note that the difference in the final transition position at equilibrium ( @xmath119 seconds ) between the @xmath79 and @xmath118 mk data sets is due to a decrease in the thermal equilibrium nuclear spin polarization of about @xmath120 at @xmath51 t.    depicted in fig .",
    "7(c ) is the fwhms extracted from a set of @xmath61 values at @xmath79 mk .",
    "all data were extracted from @xmath107 second responses except for those @xmath121 , which are from @xmath122 seconds responses and can be used as lower bounds for the @xmath107 second values .",
    "the transitions between the different electron spin phases are clearly marked by sudden changes in the width of the transition curve at @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( indicated by the vertical red dashed lines ) . the clear transition helped us to construct the thermodynamic phase - diagram depicted in fig .",
    "although the data were limited to the range of @xmath79 to @xmath118 mk , we can see that the area at which the caf state was expected to occur shrank as the sample temperature was raised .",
    "we estimated that the caf state would completely disappear above @xmath125 mk by extrapolating the data linearly to the point where both lines converge ( blue oval ) .",
    "for a quantum hall state with easy - plane quantum ferromagnets , this point is associated with kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition temperature@xcite .",
    "the estimated @xmath126 mk from our experiment is lower than the theoretical prediction @xmath127 k@xcite , but in agreement with the previously estimated @xmath128 deduced from resistively detected @xmath3 measurements@xcite .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy was due to disorder that might significantly lower the critical temperature @xmath128@xcite .",
    "in summary , we uncovered an unusual nuclear spin relaxation process due to interaction with the caf state by measuring the full profile of the @xmath4 spin transition .",
    "we observed that only when the current pumping time was greater than the @xmath118 seconds did the downward nuclear spin polarization completely relax after a one second interaction with the caf state .",
    "this could indicate the possibility of a collective relaxation from a large ensemble of polarized nuclear spins .",
    "our nuclear magnetometry scheme and analysis of the fwhm of the spin transition @xmath4 could be used to identify the transition between different phases existing at @xmath0 and draw a @xmath129 diagram of the caf state .",
