    "environmental conditions ( e.g. light , precipitation , nutrient availability ) vary in space and time .",
    "since these conditions influence survivorship and fecundity of an organism , all organisms whether they be plants , animals , or viruses are faced with a fundamental quandary of `` should i stay or should i go ? '' on the one hand , if individuals disperse in a spatially heterogeneous environment , then they may arrive in locations with poorer environmental conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "if individuals do not disperse , then they may fare poorly due to temporal fluctuations in local environmental conditions .",
    "the consequences of this interaction between dispersal and environmental heterogeneity for population growth has been studied extensively from theoretical , experimental , and applied perspectives  @xcite . here",
    ", we provide a mathematically rigorous perspective on these interactive effects using spatially explicit models of stochastic population growth .",
    "population growth is inherently stochastic due to numerous unpredictable causes . for a single , unstructured population with overlapping generations , the simplest",
    "model accounting for these fluctuations is a linear stochastic differential equation of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the population abundance at time @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the mean per - capita growth rate ( that is , @xmath34 \\approx z \\mu \\delta t$ ] ) , @xmath35 is the `` infinitesimal '' variance of fluctuations in the per - capita growth rate ( that is , @xmath36 \\approx z^2 \\sigma^2   \\delta t$ ] ) , and @xmath37 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "equivalently , the log population abundance @xmath38 is normally distributed with mean @xmath39 and variance @xmath40 . hence",
    ", even if the mean per - capita growth rate @xmath33 is positive these populations decline exponentially towards extinction when @xmath41 due to the predominance of the stochastic fluctuations . despite its simplicity",
    ", the model is used extensively for projecting future population sizes and estimating extinction risk  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated @xmath33 and @xmath42 for six endangered species .",
    "these estimates provided a favorable outlook for the continued recovery of the whooping crane ( i.e. @xmath43 ) , but unfavorable prospects for the yellowstone grizzly bear .",
    "individuals can not avoid being subject to temporal heterogeneity , but it is only when they disperse that they are affected by spatial variation in the environment .",
    "the effect of spatial heterogeneity on population growth depends , intuitively , on how individuals respond to environmental cues  @xcite .",
    "when movement is towards regions with superior habitat quality , the presence of spatial heterogeneity increases the rate of population growth  @xcite .",
    "the most extreme form of this phenomenon occurs when individuals are able to disperse freely and ideally ; that is , they can move instantly to the locations that maximize their per - capita growth rate  @xcite .",
    "anthropogenically altered habitats , however , can cause a disassociation between cues used by organisms to assess habitat quality and the actual habitat quality .",
    "this disassociation can result in negative associations between movement patterns and habitat quality and a corresponding reduction in the rate of population growth  @xcite .",
    "for `` random diffusive movement '' ( that is , no association between movement patterns and habitat quality ) , spatial heterogeneity increases population growth rates due to the influence of patches of higher quality . however , this boost in growth rate is most potent for sedentary populations  @xcite .",
    "this dilutionary effect of dispersal on population growth was observed in the invasion of a woody weed , _ mimosa pigra _",
    ", into the wetlands of tropical australia  @xcite . a relatively fast disperser , this weed had a population doubling time of 1.2 years on favorable patches ,",
    "but it exhibited much slower growth at the regional scale ( doubling time of 6.7 years ) due to the separation of suitable wetland habitats by unsuitable eucalyptus savannas .    despite these substantial analytic advances in understanding separately the effects of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on population growth , there are few analytic studies that consider the combined effects . for well - mixed populations with non - overlapping generations living in patchy environments , @xcite showed that population growth is determined by the geometric mean in time of the spatially ( arithmetically ) averaged per - capita growth rates .",
    "a surprising consequence of this expression is that populations coupled by dispersal can persist even though they are extinction prone in every patch  @xcite .",
    "this `` rescue effect '' , however , only occurs when spatial correlations are sufficiently weak  @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended these results by deriving an analytic approximation for stochastic growth rates for partially mixing populations .",
    "this approximation reveals that positive temporal correlations can inflate population growth rates at intermediate dispersal rates , a conclusion consistent with simulation and empirical studies  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite manipulated metapopulations of _ paramecium aurelia _ by varying spatial - temporal patterns of temperature . in spatially uncorrelated environments",
    ", the populations coupled by dispersal always persisted for the duration of the experiment , while some of the uncoupled populations went extinct .",
    "moreover , metapopulations experiencing positive temporal correlations exhibited higher growth rates than metapopulations living in temporally uncorrelated environments .    here ,",
    "we introduce and analyze stochastic models of populations that continuously experience uncertainty in time and space . for these models ,",
    "our analysis answers some fundamental questions in population biology such as :    * how is the long - term spatial distribution of a population related to its rate of growth ?",
    "* when are population growth rates maximized at low , high , or intermediate dispersal rates for populations exhibiting diffusive movement ?",
    "* what is ideal free movement for individuals constantly facing uncertainty about local environmental conditions ?",
    "* to what extent do spatial correlations in temporal fluctuations hamper population persistence ? * how do multiple spatial scales of environmental heterogeneity influence population persistence ?    in section  [ s : model ] we introduce our model for population growth in a patchy environment .",
    "it describes temporal fluctuations in the qualities of the various patches using multivariate brownian motions with correlated components .    in section",
    "[ s : distribution_growth ] , we first consider the vector - valued stochastic process given by the proportions of the population in each patch .",
    "these proportions converge in distribution to a ( random ) equilibrium at large times .",
    "the probability that this equilibrium spatial distribution is in some given subset of the set of possible patch proportions is just the long - term average amount of time that the process spends in that subset .",
    "we derive a simple expression for the stochastic growth of the population in terms of the first and second moments of this equilibrium spatial distribution .",
    "we also show that this equilibrium spatial distribution is characterized by a solution of a pde that we solve in the case of two patches and use to examine how the equilibrium spatial distribution depends on the dispersal mechanism .",
    "we then present some numerical simulations to give a first indication of the interesting range of phenomena that can occur when there is spatial heterogeneity in per - capita growth rates and biased movement between patches .",
    "we use the results from section  [ s : distribution_growth ] in section  [ s : ideal_free ] to investigate ideal free dispersal in stochastic environments .",
    "that is , we determine which forms of dispersal maximize the stochastic growth rate for given mean per - capita growth rates in each of the patches and given infinitesimal covariances for their temporal fluctuations .",
    "we consider the effect of constraints on dispersal in section  [ s : constraints ] .",
    "we suppose that the dispersal rates are fixed up to a scalar multiple @xmath44 and establish an analytic approximation for the stochastic growth rate of the form @xmath45 for large @xmath44 .",
    "we use this approximation to give criteria for whether low , intermediate , or high dispersal rates maximize the stochastic growth rate .",
    "in particular , we combine this analysis with tools from group representation theory to obtain results on the stochastic growth rate for environments with multiple spatial scales .",
    "we discuss how our results relate to existing literature in section  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "we end with a collection of appendices where , for the sake of streamlining the presentation of our results in the remainder of the paper , we collect most of the proofs .",
    "we consider a population with overlapping generations living in a spatially heterogeneous environment consisting of @xmath10 distinct patches and suppose that the per - capita growth rates within each patch are determined by a mixture of deterministic and stochastic environmental inputs .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the abundance of the population in the @xmath16-th patch at time @xmath32 and write @xmath47 for the resulting column vector ( we will use the superscript @xmath48 throughout to denote the transpose of a vector or a matrix ) .",

    "we implicitly assume in the above set - up that all dispersing individuals arrive in some patch on the landscape . to account for dispersal induced mortality",
    ", we can add fictitious patches in which dispersing individuals enter and experience a mortality rate before dispersing to their final destination .",
    "also , our model does not include density - dependent effects on population growth .",
    "however , one can view it as a linearization of a density - dependent model about the extinction equilibrium @xmath74 and , therefore , determines how the population grows when abundances are low .",
    "moreover , for discrete - time analogues of our model , positive population growth for this linearization implies persistence in the sense that there exists a unique positive stationary distribution for corresponding models with compensating density - dependence  @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that the same conclusion holds for our continuous time model .",
    "* from now on we assume * that the dispersal matrix @xmath29 is _ irreducible _ ( that is , that it can not be put into block upper - triangular form by a re - labeling of the patches ) .",

    "the within - island means are approximately constant , so that @xmath449 will be small .",
    "therefore , since @xmath435 is negative for all @xmath406 , having local positive association of @xmath33 at nearby patches leads to higher stochastic growth rates , at least for large enough values of the dispersal parameter @xmath44 .     of equation",
    "all other things being equal , the species will do better if the good habitat is concentrated on particular islands , rather than spread out across many .",
    "finally , we can observe that adding new scales of metapatch may change the situation from one in which @xmath191 is maximal at high values of the dispersal parameter @xmath44 to one in which @xmath191 is maximal at intermediate values of @xmath44 , or vice - versa . if @xmath450 , then @xmath451 and @xmath449 are both zero , and changing @xmath452 ( for example , going from one to several islands in our example ) will increase @xmath451 . changing @xmath452 will also add the quantity @xmath453 to all values of @xmath435 .",
    "the result of this could be to change the sign of the coefficient of @xmath454 in .     of equation   the optimal level of dispersal for",
    "a subpopulation , and the growth rate at that level of dispersal , may differ drastically depending on whether it is connected ( or connectable ) by dispersal to other subpopulations .",
    "classical ecology theory predicts that environmental stochasticity increases extinction risk by reducing the long term per - capita growth rate of populations  @xcite . for sedentary populations in a spatially homogeneous yet temporally variable environment , a simple model of their growth",
    "is given by the stochastic differential equation @xmath455 , where @xmath393 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "the stochastic growth rate for such populations equals @xmath8 ; the reduction in the growth rate is proportional to the infinitesimal variance of the noise . here",
    ", we show that a similar expression describes the growth of populations dispersing in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments . more specifically , if average per - capita growth rate in patch @xmath16 is @xmath15 and the infinitesimal spatial covariance between environmental noise in patches @xmath16 and @xmath18 is @xmath456 , then the stochastic growth rate equals the average of the mean per - capita growth rate @xmath457 $ ] experienced by the population when the proportions of the population in the various patches have reached equilibrium minus half of the average temporal variation @xmath458 $ ] experienced by the population in equilibrium .",
    "the law of @xmath24 , the random equilibrium spatial distribution of the population which provides the weights in these averages , is determined by interactions between spatial heterogeneity in mean per - capita growth rates , the infinitesimal spatial covariances of the environmental noise , and population movement patterns . to investigate how these interactions effect the stochastic growth rate",
    ", we derived analytic expressions for the law of @xmath24 , determined what choice of dispersal mechanisms resulted in optimal stochastic growth rates for a freely dispersing population , and considered the consequences on the stochastic growth rate of limiting the population to a fixed dispersal mechanism .",
    "as we now discuss , these analytic results provide fundamental insights into `` ideal free '' movement in the face of uncertainty , the persistence of coupled sink populations , the evolution of dispersal rates , and the single large or several small ( sloss ) debate in conservation biology .    in spatially heterogeneous environments , `` ideal free '' individuals disperse to the patch or patches that maximize their long term per - capita growth rate  @xcite . in the absence of environmental stochasticity and density - dependent feedbacks",
    ", ideal free dispersers only select the patches supporting the highest per - capita growth rate . here , we show that uncertainty due to environmental stochasticity can overturn this prediction . provided environmental stochasticity is sufficiently strong and spatial correlations are sufficiently weak , equation implies that ideal free dispersers occupy all patches despite spatial variation in the local stochastic growth rates @xmath459 . intuitively , by spending time in multiple patches , including those that in isolation support lower stochastic growth rates , individuals reduce the net environmental variation @xmath460 they experience and , thereby , increase their stochastic growth rate .",
    "hence , dispersing to lower quality patches is a form of bet - hedging against environmental uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "when environmental fluctuations in higher quality patches are sufficiently strong , this spatial bet - hedging can result in ideal free dispersers occupying sink patches ; patches that are unable in the absence of immigration to sustain a population .",
    "this latter prediction is consistent with holt s analysis of a discrete - time two patch model  @xcite .",
    "spatial correlations in environmental fluctuations , however , can disrupt spatial bet - hedging .",
    "movement between patches exhibiting strongly covarying environmental fluctuations has little effect on the net environmental variation @xmath460 experienced by individuals and , therefore , movement to lower quality patches may confer little or no advantage to individuals . indeed ,",
    "when the spatial covariation is sufficiently strong , ideal free dispersers only occupy patches with the highest local stochastic growth rates @xmath461 , similar to the case of deterministic environments . in deterministic environments ,",
    "density dependent feedbacks can result in ideal - free dispersers occupying multiple patches including sink patches  @xcite .",
    "our results show that even density - independent processes can result in populations occupying multiple patches . however , both of these processes are likely to play important roles in the evolution of patch selection .",
    "a sink population is a local population that is sustained by immigration  @xcite . removing immigration results in a steady decline to extinction .",
    "in contrast , source populations persist in the absence of immigration .",
    "empirical studies have shown that landscapes often partition into mosaics of source and sink populations  @xcite . for discrete - time two - patch models",
    ", @xcite showed , quite surprisingly , that sink populations coupled by dispersal can persist , a prediction supported by recent empirical studies with protozoan populations  @xcite and extended to discrete - time multi - patch models  @xcite .",
    "here , we show a similar phenomena occurs for populations experiencing continuous temporal fluctuations . for example , if the stochastic growth rates in all patches equal @xmath462 and the spatial correlation between patches is @xmath131 , then equations and imply that populations dispersing freely between @xmath10 patches persist whenever @xmath463 . hence , ideal free movement mediates persistence whenever local environmental fluctuations produce sink populations ( i.e. , @xmath464 ) , environmental fluctuations are nt fully spatially correlated ( i.e. @xmath465 ) and there are sufficiently many patches ( i.e. , @xmath466 ) . this latter expression for",
    "the necessary number of patches to mediate persistence is an exact , continuous time counterpart to an approximation by @xcite for discrete time models .",
    "when two patches are sufficient to mediate persistence , equation reveals that there is a critical dispersal rate below which the population is extinction prone and above which it persists .",
    "our high dispersal approximation ( see equation with @xmath467=0 $ ] ) suggests this dispersal threshold also exists for an arbitrary number of patches .    while ideal free movement corresponds to the optimal dispersal strategy for species without any constraints on their movement or their ability to collect information , many organisms experience these constraints .",
    "for instance , in the absence of information about environmental conditions in other patches , individuals may move randomly between patches , in which case the rate of movement ( rather than the pattern of movement ) is subject to natural selection  @xcite .",
    "when density - dependent feedbacks are weak and certain symmetry assumptions are met , our high dispersal approximation in implies there is selection for higher dispersal rates whenever @xmath468 where , recall , @xmath469 , @xmath470 are the eigenvalues / vectors of the dispersal matrix , @xmath33 is the vector of per - capita growth rates , and @xmath471 are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for the environmental noise . roughly speaking ,",
    "equation   asserts that if temporal variation ( averaged in the appropriate manner ) exceeds spatial variation , then there is selection for faster dispersers ; a prediction consistent with the general consensus of earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in the highly symmetric case where the temporal variation in all patches equals @xmath35 and the spatial correlation between patches is @xmath131 , equation   simplifies to @xmath472 } , \\ ] ] in which case lower spatial correlations and larger number of patches also facilitate selection for faster dispersers . another important constraint influencing the evolution of dispersal",
    "are travel costs that reduce fitness of dispersing individuals .",
    "while the effect of these costs have been investigated for deterministic models  @xcite , it remains to be seen how these traveling costs interact with environmental stochasticity in determining optimal dispersal strategies .",
    "previous studies have shown that spatial heterogeneity in per - capita growth rates increases the net population growth rate for deterministic models with diffusive movement  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , spatial heterogeneity provides patches with higher per - capita growth rates that boost the population growth rate , a boost that gets diluted at higher dispersal rates .",
    "our high dispersal approximation shows that this boost also occurs in temporally heterogeneous environments , i.e. the correction term @xmath473 is positive .",
    "more importantly , the multiscale version of this correction term implies this boost is larger when the variation in the per - capita growth rates occurs at multiple spatial scales .",
    "for example , for insects living on plants in meadows on islands , the largest boost occurs when the higher quality plants ( i.e. the plants supporting the largest @xmath15 values ) occur on the same island in the same meadow .",
    "this analytic conclusion is consistent with numerical simulations showing that habitat fragmentation ( e.g. distributing high quality plants more evenly across islands and meadows ) increases extinction risk  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , spatial aggregation of higher quality patches increases the chance of individuals dispersing away from a high quality patch arriving in another high quality patch . even without spatial variation in per - capita growth rates ,",
    "equation implies that strong spatial aggregation of patches maximizes stochastic growth rates for dispersive populations living in environments where temporal correlations decrease with spatial scale .",
    "this finding promotes the view that a single large ( sl ) reserve is a better for conservation than several small ( ss ) reserves .",
    "this finding is consistent with many arguments in the sloss debate  @xcite .",
    "for example , using reaction - diffusion equations , @xcite found that even in deterministic environments `` [ it ] is better for a population to have a few large regions of favorable habitat than a great many small ones closely intermingled with unfavorable regions . '' however , our results run contrary to a numerical simulation study of @xcite that , unlike ours , applies to sedentary populations experiencing independent environments  @xcite .    while our work provides a diversity of analytical insights into the interactive effects of temporal variability , spatial heterogeneity , and movement on long - term population growth , many challenges remain .",
    "most notably , are there analytic approximations for relatively sedentary populations ? what effect do correlations in the temporal fluctuations have on the stochastic growth rate ? can the explicit formulas for stochastic growth rates in two patch environments be extended to special classes of higher dimensional models ? can one extend the analysis to account for density - dependent feedbacks ?",
    "answers to these questions are likely to provide important insights into the evolution of dispersal and metapopulation persistence .",
