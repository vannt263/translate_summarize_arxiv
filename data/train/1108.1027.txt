    "is quantum physics a complete theory or does the description of nature s laws require local hidden variable theories ?",
    "the answer to this question , which has been asked by einstein , podolsky and rosen in 1935 , can be found by realizing a bell test @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "two distant observers who performed appropriate measurements on entangled photon pairs , have observed correlated results violating a bell inequality , even though the measurement choices were made long after the pair creation @xcite and even though the photons were too far from each other to agree on the results once they knew the measurement basis @xcite . on the other hand , two ions close to each other ,",
    "have also exhibited the violation of a bell inequality even though they were forced to give a result at each trial @xcite .",
    "but to constitute a definitive answer , it would be necessary to close all the loopholes in the same bell experiment , i.e. to perform a bell test both at a distance and with high detection efficiencies .",
    "+ closing the detection loophole for the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite requires overall detection efficiencies larger than 82.8% for a maximally entangled state and larger than 66.7% using partially entangled states @xcite in the absence of other imperfections .",
    "this threshold detection efficiency can further be lowered using states with a dimension higher than qubits .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that a detection efficiency of 61.8% can be tolerated using four dimensional states and a four - setting bell inequality .",
    "however , considering realistic noise and achievable coupling into the quantum channel ( usually an optical fiber ) and detection efficiencies , one rapidly becomes aware that closing the detection loophole in an optical bell test is extremely challenging .",
    "but let us keep hope alive !",
    "+ the problem of the single - photon detection efficiency might be circumvented by using homodyne measurements which are known to be very efficient @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "theoretical proposals leading to substantial violations of bell s inequalities and combining feasible states and measurements have been put forth recently @xcite .",
    "+ an attractive alternative is to use an asymmetric configuration involving e.g. atom - photon entanglement .",
    "since the atom can be detected with an efficiency close to one , the detection efficiency on the photon side is lower than the case where the detections at both sides are inefficient @xcite , as low as 50% for the chsh inequality and 43% using a three - setting inequality .",
    "furthermore , the photon is naturally used to distribute entanglement over long distances so that the choice of the measurement on one side and the measurement result on the other side can easily be spacelike separated .",
    "note that the entanglement between internal states of an atom and the polarization degree of freedom of a photon have already been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "such entanglement has further been used to entangle remote atoms from an entanglement swapping operation @xcite .",
    "we focus on the entanglement between internal states of an atom and a partially filled optical mode , containing on average less than one photon , as described in detail in section [ sec1 ] .",
    "we propose bell type scenarios either combining a homodyne detection and a photon counting on the optical mode or using homodyne detections only to characterize this special entanglement .",
    "although homodyne detections are used , we show in section [ sec2 ] that unexpectedly large violations of the chsh inequality could be observed .",
    "we also present a feasibility study in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we provide the minimal entanglement generation and photon counting efficiencies that are required to close the detection loophole .",
    "we then give the typical distance that is necessary to close the locality loophole .",
    "we also take the branching ratios into account , we analyze the effect of the atomic motion and we present the requirement on the optical path length stability .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    ", width=5 ]    let us start by a description of the methods enabling the creation of entanglement between two atomic states and a single optical mode containing on average less than one photon . consider an atom with a lambda - type level configuration ( as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , initially prepared in the state @xmath0 a pump laser pulse with the rabi frequency @xmath1 partially excites the atom in such a way that it can spontaneously decay into the level @xmath2 by emitting a photon @xcite .",
    "long after the decay time of the atom , the atom - photon state is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 refers to the area of the pump pulse .",
    "the phase term is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) corresponds to the wave vector of the pump ( the spontaneous photon ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the atom position when the pump photon is absorbed ( the spontaneous photon is emitted ) .",
    "note that @xmath11 may vary in practice , e.g. due to atom position variations .",
    "the requirements for the phase stability are studied in detail below but we first answer the question : can the entanglement between an atom and a partially filled optical mode be measured from the violation of a bell inequality ? +",
    "first , let us recall the principle of a bell - chsh test .",
    "two distant observers , usually named alice and bob , share a quantum state .",
    "each of them chooses randomly a measurement among two projectors , @xmath12 for alice , @xmath13 for bob , @xmath14 $ ] and obtains a binary result , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for alice and bob respectively . by repeating the experiment several times",
    ", alice and bob can compute the conditional probabilities @xmath17 they can then easily deduce the value of the chsh parameter @xmath18 where @xmath19 alice and bob will conclude that the observed correlations can not be described by local hidden variable theories if they find measurement settings such that @xmath20 note that all possible states leading to a violation of a bell inequality are entangled . therefore , a bell test can be seen as a test of the laws of nature but also as a witness of entanglement .",
    "+      now , consider the specific case where alice and bob share a state of the form ( [ atom_halfphoton_ent ] ) .",
    "alice applies projective measurements on the atomic states and can freely choose projections on arbitrary vectors @xmath21 of the bloch sphere . for each measurement @xmath22 @xmath23",
    ", alice sets @xmath24 if she gets a result along @xmath25 and @xmath26 if the result is directed along @xmath27 bob applies measurements on the optical mode and chooses either to count the photon number @xmath28 or to measure the quadrature @xmath29 when he measures @xmath30 he naturally sets the results @xmath31 if the result is positive and @xmath32 if there is no photon .",
    "when he performs the quadrature measurement , he gets a real number @xmath33 he then has to process this result to get binary outcomes .",
    "he decides to attribute the results @xmath34 if the result is negative @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "+ we now show that alice and bob can obtain a substantial violation of the chsh inequality for appropriate settings . but let us first detail the calculation of probability distributions @xmath37 for the four pairs of measurements separately .",
    "when bob measures @xmath30 he gets @xmath32 with the probability @xmath38 and alice s qubit is projected into @xmath39 therefore , @xmath40 similarly @xmath41 following similar lines for @xmath42 one finds @xmath43 leading to @xmath44 when bob measures @xmath45 and obtains @xmath46 alice s state is projected into @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the probability amplitude distribution for the vacuum and single photon fock states ( @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the hermite polynomial ) .",
    "@xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is merely deduced from @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "one can check that @xmath56 has the same expression than @xmath57 but where the integration over dx runs from 0 to @xmath58 one finds @xmath59 interestingly , this expression is the same , up to a factor of @xmath60 , as the expression of the correlator when bob applies a perfect qubit measurement along @xmath61 .",
    "this invites us to interpret the homodyne measurement above ( with the binning @xmath62 , @xmath63 and in the @xmath64 subspace ) , as a noisy qubit measurement in the x - y plane of the bloch sphere with visibility @xmath60 , as was also noticed in @xcite .",
    "+ substituting the correlators by their expressions into ( [ bell_inequality ] ) , one obtains a value of the chsh polynomial for any state of the form ( [ atom_halfphoton_ent ] ) and for any measurement of alice .",
    "we found the maximal violation @xmath65 for @xmath66 @xmath67 i.e. the @xmath68 state and for @xmath69 and @xmath70 this violation is the largest that we know in a scenario involving a homodyne detection where both the measurements and the state could be realized experimentally ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+      a natural question is whether a violation of the chsh inequality can also be observed by measuring the optical mode with homodyne detections only .",
    "it turns out that a violation @xmath71 can indeed be obtained if alice and bob share a maximally entangled state of the form ( [ atom_halfphoton_ent ] ) with @xmath72 and @xmath67 , provided that bob s measurements are performed in complementary quadratures @xmath73 and @xmath74 and that alice s measurements correspond to projections along vectors spanning the ( xy ) plane with angles @xmath75 between them .",
    "this result can easily be understood using the analogy previously mentioned .",
    "if bob would have used either @xmath76 or @xmath77 the chsh parameter would have been saturated @xmath78 since @xmath79 and @xmath80 correspond to such measurements but with the reduced visibility @xmath81 s is reduced by the corresponding factor .",
    "so far , we have shown that an ideal realization would lead to significant violations of the chsh inequality .",
    "however , the story would not be complete without a discussion taking experimental imperfections into account .",
    "+      let @xmath82 be the transmission efficiency which accounts for all the coupling inefficiencies from the atom to bob s location .",
    "the probability amplitude associated to @xmath83 is now multiplied by @xmath84 and alice and bob can share the state @xmath85 with the probability @xmath86 alternatively , the photon can be lost . tracing out the lost photon ,",
    "the resulting state is @xmath87 and it contributes to the global state with a weight @xmath88 to know the sensitivity of the chsh inequality with respect to the transmission inefficiency , we thus have to compute s from the overall state @xmath89 for all possible values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 as a function of @xmath92 the result is shown in fig . [ fig2 ] . in the scenario where bob uses a photon counter and a homodyne detection with unit efficiencies ,",
    "a transmission efficiency of @xmath93 can be tolerated ( see blue curve ) .",
    "although this is certainly demanding , recent results suggest that this might soon be within reach of experiments @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to study the sensitivity of the violation with respect to the detection inefficiency .",
    "the homodyne measurements can fairly be considered to have unit efficiencies but most of the single - photon detectors are inefficient .",
    "let @xmath94 be the efficiency of the photon counting detector . from an optimization similar to the previous one",
    ", we found that a threshold detection of @xmath95 can be tolerated for a transmission with unit efficiency .",
    "our scheme is less sensitive to counting inefficiency than transmission inefficiency since the former affects only one of bob s measurements .",
    "the two previous efficiency thresholds can be compared with a scheme that exhibits the same asymmetry but uses the entanglement with the polarization mode @xcite and where the violation of the chsh inequality requires @xmath96 .",
    "( the effect of detection and transmission imperfections is the same in this case , since bob uses two photon counting detectors . )",
    "the latter is less sensitive to inefficiency in the transmission ( for ideal detectors with @xmath97 ) , while the scheme we propose is less sensitive to the detector inefficiency ( for transmission with @xmath98 ) note also that regarding the results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite where the threshold efficiency has been lowered using inequalities with more settings , one could have hoped improvements using inequalities different from the chsh inequality",
    ". however , we could not find better resistances with additional binnings for bob s results and for more ( up to three ) inputs .",
    "+ in the case where bob uses only quadrature measurements , the chsh inequality can be violated provided that the transmission efficiency is larger than 79% . this result can not fairly be compared with other schemes using atom - photon entanglement since this is the only one that we know where all the detections can be reasonably considered perfectly efficient and where only the transmission inefficiency decreases the violation .",
    "+     the full lines correspond to the case where bob chooses either a photon counter or a measurement of a field quadrature .",
    "the upper ( blue ) curve is associated to a photon detector with unit efficiency @xmath97 .",
    "the three other full lines are associated to inefficient counting ( from @xmath99 to @xmath100 the dashed line is associated to the case where bob uses two homodyne detections ( with unit efficiencies).,width=9 ]      in the previous subsection , we have addressed efficiency issues related with the photon detection and with the transmission .",
    "if we intend to close the locality loophole too , we have to give an answer how long the state detection takes .",
    "it is likely reasonable to believe that the detection time is limited by the atom @xcite .",
    "if the atomic states are readout on the basis of stimulated raman adiabatic passage , ultrafast laser - ionization and registration of the correlated electron - ion pairs with coincident counting via two opposing channel electron multipliers @xcite , we can reach a measurement time of less than 1 @xmath101 therefore , the locality loophole could be closed if alice and bob are separated by 300 m. for 800 nm photons , the losses are of 2db / km .",
    "this would translate into a transmission of 93% .",
    "so far , we have considered that once the atom is excited , it decays into the state @xmath102 consider the more realistic case where the decay from @xmath103 to @xmath2 occurs with the probability @xmath104 let @xmath105 be the probability for a decay into @xmath106 and @xmath107 the decay probability into other auxiliary states such that @xmath108 taking these branching ratios into account , the state long after the interaction with the pump pulse is @xmath109 @xmath110 is defined from @xmath111 where @xmath82 is replaced by @xmath112 and @xmath113 + we now present a strategy to make @xmath114 ( calculated from this state ) as soon as @xmath115 if alice chooses to attribute the result @xmath26 when she measures the atom in the state @xmath116 the correlators calculated from @xmath117 are @xmath118 and the resulting s value is equal to @xmath119 in this case . moreover",
    ", if she chooses two measurements very close to @xmath120 i.e. @xmath121 and @xmath122 one can check that the s value computed from the component @xmath123 is @xmath124 if she further excites the atom so that @xmath72 and @xmath125 and if bob chooses @xmath126 the s value from @xmath110 is roughly @xmath127 the overall chsh value is thus given by @xmath128 therefore , in the absence of errors , a violation of the chsh inequality can be observed as soon as the probability that the excited atom decays into @xmath2 is non - zero .",
    "this bell test can thus be applied to a large number of atomic species since it is very resistant to branching ratio variations .",
    "however , the larger the decay into @xmath2 is , the larger the violation .",
    "+      let us now focus on the phase stability constrains .",
    "the phase term of the state ( [ atom_halfphoton_ent ] ) has to stay stable from trial to trial . in practice , however , @xmath11 may vary , e.g. due to atom position variations . for wavevectors with the same norm",
    "@xmath129 the fidelity of the resulting entanglement @xmath130 is found to be @xmath131 in the weak confinement regime @xcite .",
    "@xmath132 is the size of the harmonic trapping potential ground state for an atom of mass @xmath133 within a trap of frequency @xmath134 @xmath135 is the average number of thermal quanta of motion and @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the angle between the pump beam and the emission direction .",
    "hence , the problem of the atomic motion can not only be overcome by cooling the ions deeply within the lamb - dicke limit ( where @xmath135 is small ) but more simply by collecting the photons scattered in the forward direction where @xmath138 + let us also comment the stability requirement on the optical path lengths .",
    "the local oscillator which is required to perform the homodyne detections at bob s location could be obtained by picking off a fraction of the pump beam with a beamsplitter . in this case",
    ", the setup will be made of a large mach - zehnder interferometer and the path length difference between the two arms of the interferometer @xmath139 has to be stable so that @xmath140 note that temperature variations change both the refraction index ( and thus @xmath141 ) and the length of fibers @xmath139 . for several tens of kilometers long commercial fibers installed in an urban environment , the typical time needed for a mean phase change of 0.1 rad ( corresponding to a fidelity of 0.9 ) is of the order of 100 @xmath142s @xcite .",
    "this lets us believe that an active stabilization of the phase should be possible even for very long interferometers using available technologies .",
    "this is well confirmed by recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "we proposed different scenarios to measure the entanglement between the internal state of an atom and an optical mode containing , on average , less than one photon .",
    "we reported large violations of a chsh inequality for both the case where one homodyne detection and one photon counting are performed on the optical mode and for two homodyne detections .",
    "with homodyne detections only , a minimal entanglement generation efficiency of 79% can be tolerated .",
    "this efficiency goes down to 61% if homodyne detections are combined with unit efficiency photon counting .",
    "we have also shown that in principle , a violation of the chsh inequality can be obtained even for branching ratios favoring the photon emission in undesired modes .",
    "there is no need to cool the atom deeply within the lamb - dicke regime if the scattered photons are collected close to the forward direction with respect to the pump propagation . finally , the stability requirements for the optical path lengths is within reach of experiments .",
    "+ we believe that our work could provide motivations for several research groups .",
    "a lot of efforts have already been devoted into the characterization of single - photon fock states with homodyne detections @xcite . moreover , although the setup recently developed by the rempe group has been used to address squeezed light @xcite , it is of particular interest for our proposal as it combines a single atom embedded a high finesse cavity with a homodyne detection .",
    "note also that , behind its fundamental interest , our proposal might find exciting applications in the framework of quantum information sciences , e.g. for device - independant quantum cryptography @xcite .",
