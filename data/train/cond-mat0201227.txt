    "the one component plasma ( ocp ) is one of the basic models in the field of charged systems .",
    "the ocp model is formulated as a system of point particles , interacting via the coulomb potential , which move in a uniform neutralizing background .",
    "it has found important physical applications in a variety of fields ranging from terrestrial physics , through important technological applications to cosmology @xcite . as a reference model",
    "it is used in many areas of soft condensed matter , such as colloidal and polyelectrolyte solutions , e.g. @xcite , etc .",
    "all thermodynamic properties of the ocp depend only on the dimensionless plasma parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bjerrum length ( @xmath6 is the charge of the particles , @xmath7 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath8 is the temperature ) and @xmath9 is the ion - sphere radius with @xmath10 being the concentration of particles ( @xmath11 is the number of particles , @xmath12 is the volume of the system ) . using a field - theoretical approach , a fairly accurate and simple expression for the equation of state of the ocp has been obtained within the gaussian approximation for the effective hamiltonian @xcite ; contrary to previous calculations , e.g. @xcite , this gives a correct behavior for the thermodynamic functions in the full range of @xmath0 ( see @xcite and references therein ) and does not have fitting parameters as e.g. in @xcite . in @xcite field - theoretical calculations for the equation of state , going beyond the gaussian approximation , have been performed , showing that corrections to the gaussian theory are rather small .",
    "a closely related model  the hard - core one component plasma ( hcocp ) incorporating a hard core repulsion between ions  gives a more satisfactory description of the short - range electrostatic correlations .",
    "the importance of this model follows also from the fact that it belongs to the class of the so - called primitive models used to describe molten salts @xcite , electrolytes @xcite , liquid metals @xcite and charged colloidal solutions @xcite .",
    "the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) @xcite was applied to account for both the hard - core and electrostatic interactions in this system @xcite .",
    "although it has an analytical solution , it exhibits sometimes unphysical negative contact values for the pair correlation function , which has to be remedied by a rescaling procedure@xcite .",
    "a mixed percus - yevick / hypernetted chain integral equation also has been used @xcite and it was observed that it fits better the simulation results @xcite than the msa and cluster expansion@xcite .",
    "the former however does not have an analytical formulation .",
    "an analytical equation of state for the hcocp has been proposed in @xcite , as a simple generalization of the hole - corrected debye - hckel theory @xcite , which in addition to the correlation hole around charged particles takes into account the hard - core repulsion .",
    "this was used afterwards to develop a generalized van der waals theory @xcite . the basic physical idea exploited in this theory",
    "is that due to the strong electrostatic repulsion a `` hole '' appears around a charged particle from which all other particles are expelled .",
    "outside the hole the electrostatic interactions are not very strong and may be described on the debye - hckel level ; the size of the hole is found self - consistently .",
    "although being physically appealing , this theory does not give a satisfactory description for large values of the plasma parameter @xmath0 for the ocp @xcite , and is also not accurate for the hcocp for large packing fractions @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 the deviations from mc data for the internal energy reach @xmath15 @xcite ) .",
    "recently _ an exact _ low - density expansion for the free energy of the hcocp has been obtained @xcite .",
    "this however can not be applied in the case of strong electrostatic interaction , i.e. for large @xmath0 .    in the present study",
    "we develop a theory which allows to derive a fairly accurate and simple equation of state for the hcocp in the whole range of @xmath0 from the debye - hckel limit @xmath16 up to the limit of strong coupling @xmath1 .",
    "it reproduces within 1 - 3% accuracy the available monte carlo ( mc ) data for @xmath17 .",
    "larger deviations occur in the region where the mc data are not very accurate ( see the discussion below ) . as in the case of the ocp",
    "@xcite we use the hubbard - schofield transformation which yields a field - theoretical hamiltonian for the hcocp with coefficients expressed in terms of equilibrium correlation functions of a reference hard - core fluid .",
    "although we perform the explicit calculations within the gaussian approximation for the effective hamiltonian , one can go beyond the gaussian approximation using the standard perturbation technique , provided the structural properties of the reference hard - core fluid are known . since the obtained equation of state is in good agreement with available mc data we use it to address the problem of additivity of the hard - core and electrostatic contributions to the excess free energy .",
    "this seems to be important since it is usually assumed that these contributions are additive ( e.g. @xcite ) and the range of validity of such approximation has not been studied yet .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 we briefly sketch the hubbard - schofield approach which yields the field - theoretical hamiltonian for the hcocp . in sec.3",
    "we derive the equation of state within the gaussian approximation for the effective hamiltonian , and compare the theoretical findings with available monte carlo data . in that section",
    "we also analyse the accuracy of the widely used approximation in which the excess free energy is written as a sum of the hard - core and electrostatic part . in the conclusion",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "we start from the hcocp hamiltonian with omitted ideal part which may be written as follows ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ 1 ] ) refers to the coulomb interactions , written in terms of collective density variables , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes coordinate of j - th particle , @xmath22 is the fourier - transformed coulomb potential and @xmath23 describes the hard - sphere interaction .",
    "summation in ( [ 1 ] ) is to be performed over the wave vectors @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are integers , @xmath28 , and the prime over the sum denotes that the term with @xmath29 is excluded @xcite .",
    "the configurational integral may be written in terms of the configurational integral of the reference ( hard - sphere liquid ) system @xmath30 @xcite as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the averaging over the reference system . in accordance with the hubbard - schofield scheme",
    "@xcite we use the identity : @xmath33 and arrive after some algebra at : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and where the integration is to be performed under restriction , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the complex conjugate of @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "applying the cumulant theorem @xcite to the factor @xmath39 one obtains :    @xmath40 , with    @xmath41    @xmath42 @xmath43 here @xmath44 denotes _ cumulant _ average @xcite for the reference hard sphere fluid system .",
    "note that ( [ 5 ] ) gives the field - theoretical expression for the partition function with , @xmath38 being the fourier components of the scalar field @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the effective hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) are expressed in terms of the correlation functions of the reference hard - core fluid . using definitions of correlation functions of fluids @xcite and definitions of the cumulant averages @xcite",
    ", one can _ directly _ evaluate @xmath46 ( and thus the coefficients @xmath47 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath48 may be expressed in terms of the fourier transforms of the correlation functions @xmath49 of the reference system , defined as @xcite @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52  are @xmath53-particle correlation functions @xcite . in particular the second - order cumulant @xmath54 may be written as : @xmath55\\,,\\ ] ] and the fourier transform of the function @xmath56 is related to the direct correlation function @xmath57 @xmath58\\,,\\ ] ] for which an explicit analytical expression is known @xcite .",
    "now we concentrate on the gaussian part of the effective hamiltonian , i.e. we skip all the terms with a power of the field larger than two .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation has been critically examined in ref.@xcite for the ocp without hard - core interactions by perturbatively calculating higher - order terms .",
    "it was found that higher order terms contribute very little to the free energy and that the gaussian approximation is in fact excellent over the whole range of coupling parameters .",
    "one can therefore assume , and this is indeed borne out by our comparison with monte - carlo data below , that the gaussian approximation should also be quite good for the present case . using ( [ h2_k ] ) and ( [ cum_2 ] ) we write for this case : @xmath59 performing ( gaussian ) integration over @xmath38 we arrive after some algebra at @xcite : @xmath60 taking the logarithm of the configuration integral one obtains the free energy , and since the analytical expression for @xmath61 is available @xcite , no additional approximation is , in principle , required .",
    "this leads , however , to an expression which is to be evaluated numerically .",
    "we note that owing to the long - range nature of the coulombic interactions , the main contribution to the free energy comes from the long - wave modes of the density fluctuations , which correspond to small @xmath62 .",
    "therefore only the small-@xmath62 behavior of the direct correlation function is important .",
    "this suggests to approximate @xmath61 by a truncated expansion @xmath63 which correctly behaves at small @xmath62 .",
    "as we show in what follows , only wave - vectors with @xmath64 contribute to the configuration integral , thus we apply the approximation ( [ c2_k ] ) for the interval @xmath65 . by numerical evaluation of the free energy using the full expression for @xmath57",
    ", we convinced ourselves that deviations of the quadratic form from the actual @xmath57 at larger @xmath62 do not noticeably affect the results@xcite .",
    "we therefore do not require @xmath62 and @xmath66 to be small since the particular behavior of @xmath57 for large @xmath62 is not important .",
    "on the other hand , the quadratic approximation allows to obtain an analytical equation of state for the hcocp that reproduces fairly well the available monte carlo data . with ( [ c2_k ] )",
    "one can write for the configurational integral : @xmath67 the most accurate estimate for @xmath68 may be found , using @xmath69 from ( [ h2_k ] ) and the relation for the isothermal compressibility @xmath70 @xcite , where @xmath71 is the pressure of the reference system @xcite : @xmath72 the value of @xmath73 follows from the fairly accurate carnahan - starling free energy of hard - sphere fluid @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the packing fraction and @xmath76 is the diameter of the spheres ; this yields @xmath73 as a second derivative of @xmath77 with respect to density : @xmath78 using the wertheim - thiele solution for the direct correlation function @xmath79 @xcite and definition of @xmath80 from eq.([c2_k ] ) one obtains : @xmath81 with @xmath82 from ( [ c_2  ] ) and @xmath83 from ( [ h2_k ] ) and ( [ z_0 ] ) we arrive at the following expression for the configurational integral @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "now we show that within the gaussian approximation to the effective hamiltonian , one obtains rather accurate equation of state for hcocp provided that an appropriate value of the `` ultraviolet cutoff '' in the @xmath86-space is employed . from ( [ q_end ] )",
    "we find for the excess free energy of the hcocp : @xmath87\\ ] ] now we argue that the summation in ( [ fex ] ) should be carried out over a _ finite _ number of the wave - vectors @xmath86 . in this",
    "we follow the debye theory of the specific heat of solids ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "namely , we assume that the total number of degrees of freedom in the system , @xmath88 , should be equal to the total number of _ physically different _ modes with the wave - vectors @xmath86 within the spherical shell of radius @xmath66 in the @xmath86-space .",
    "the number of modes is twice the number of the wave - vectors , since for each @xmath86 one has a sine and cosine mode ( the amplitude of the @xmath86-th mode is a complex number ) @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath89 where the factor @xmath90 appears when the integration in @xmath86-space is used instead of summation . from ( [ k0_def ] )",
    "follows that @xmath91 a similar debye - like scheme to find the cutoff @xmath66 was first proposed for plasma in @xcite , where a somewhat different value of the cutoff wave - vector was reported . using @xmath66",
    "as obtained above we write : @xmath92\\\\ \\phantom{*}\\\\ \\displaystyle\\qquad=\\frac{\\beta f_{hc}}{n}+\\frac{9}{4}\\int\\nolimits^1_0x^2dx \\left[\\ln\\left(\\theta+\\frac{b\\gamma z_0}{x^2}\\right)-\\frac{b\\gamma}{x^2}\\right]\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 ( see ( [ nukdef ] ) for the definition of @xmath95 ) , and where we define the constant @xmath96 .",
    "the last integral is easily evaluated and yields for the excess free energy @xmath97-\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{b\\gamma z_0}{\\theta}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\theta}{b\\gamma z_0}}\\phantom{|}\\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath98 and for the excess internal energy , @xmath99 of the hcocp @xmath100\\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath101 , eqs.([fex_fin],[u_fin ] ) recover the corresponding result for the one component plasma @xcite .",
    "as it follows from ( [ fex_fin ] ) and ( [ u_fin ] ) , for @xmath102 and @xmath103 the debye - huckel behavior is obtained . in the opposite limit @xmath1 and for any packing fraction @xmath13 eqs.([fex_fin ] ) and",
    "( [ u_fin ] ) demonstrate a linear behavior on @xmath0 .",
    "the leading term for this case is @xmath104 , where the constant @xmath105 reads : @xmath106 this is fairly close to the constant @xmath107 of the fits for the ocp ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    for arbitrary values of @xmath13 and @xmath0",
    "we compare our analytical expression for the excess internal energy ( [ u_fin ] ) with the available mc data for the hcocp ( fig.1 ) .",
    "fig.2 shows the relative error of the analytical expression ( [ u_fin ] ) .",
    "as it follows from fig.1 and fig.2 the equation of state is fairly accurate in full range of plasma parameters for which mc data are available . for @xmath108 the relative error does not exceed @xmath109 for all values of packing fraction and plasma parameter . for @xmath110",
    "one observes the linear behavior and deviation from the numerical data for this range of @xmath0 less than @xmath111 .",
    "the maximal deviation of the analytical expression from the mc data occurs for @xmath112 . in this range of the plasma parameter",
    "the deviation is about @xmath113 with the maximal one of @xmath114 at the smallest value @xmath115 .",
    "it should be noted however , that such deviation occurs for @xmath0 , where the method of mc loses its accuracy .",
    "moreover , we expect that for very small packing fraction , @xmath116 , where the maximal deviation is observed , the contribution to the internal energy due to the hard - core interactions may not exceed @xmath111 .",
    "therefore for this @xmath13 the difference between @xmath3 of the hcocp and @xmath3 of the ocp is less then @xmath111 .",
    "it has been already shown that the analytical equation of state for the ocp ( which follows from ( [ u_fin ] ) for @xmath101 ) has the accuracy of @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "thus we expect that the accuracy of our equation of state may not be worse than @xmath118 for these values of @xmath13 ; the observed deviation of @xmath114 seems to be the manifestation of the low accuracy of mc for this range of parameters .      with",
    "the equation of state obtained we can analyse the accuracy of the widely used approximation for the excess free energy , which represents this as a sum of the hard - core and electrostatic component , @xmath119 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the validity of this approximation may be checked by the direct comparison of the excess free energy of the hcocp @xmath120 and the above sum .",
    "for @xmath120 we use our equation of state ( [ fex_fin ] ) and equation of state for ocp from @xcite ( this expression for @xmath121 may be obtained from eq.([fex_fin ] ) for @xmath101 ) .",
    "for @xmath122 we use the carnahan - starling eq.([fhc ] ) . in fig.3",
    "we compare the  complete  equation of state ( solid lines ) with the approximate , based on the assumption of additivity of the hard - core and electrostatic parts ( dashed lines ) .",
    "as it follows from fig.3 for small @xmath0 the values of the free energy from the  complete  and approximate equations of state may differ significantly ; they may even have different signs .",
    "the relative difference becomes smaller with increasing @xmath0 ( see inset to fig.3 ) and decreasing packing fraction .",
    "for @xmath123 the approximation reaches the reasonable accuracy : the error does not exceed @xmath113 for all @xmath13 . for small packing fractions , @xmath124 one has the same accuracy already for @xmath110 .",
    "a `` first - principle '' equation of state for the classical hard - core one component plasma is obtained that has a correct debye - huckel behavior at the limit of small plasma parameter @xmath0 and small packing fractions ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) .",
    "it demonstrates a linear dependence on @xmath0 for any packing fraction if @xmath127 .",
    "the obtained coefficient @xmath128 at the linear leading term in this case is close to the corresponding coefficient @xmath129 found for the one component plasma in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the simple analytical expression for the excess internal energy reproduces the available mc data with an accuracy of @xmath109 for the most range of @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "the maximal deviation of @xmath114 is observed for small @xmath0 and @xmath13 , where the mc method is not very accurate , and we argue that such deviation does not reflect the accuracy of our equation .    to derive the equation of state we apply the hubbard - schofield transformation to obtain the field theoretical hamiltonian for the hcopc and use the gaussian approximation .",
    "the gaussian approximation assumes that one can neglect all terms in the effective hamiltonian which contain the power of field higher than two .",
    "as it was shown by the field theoretical calculations for the case of the one component plasma ( without the hard - core ) @xcite , the corrections to the gaussian theory are rather small , and we expect that the same is true for the system of interest .",
    "physically , this implies that the higher - order coefficients in the field theoretical hamiltonian are smaller than that at the second order of the field . in this case",
    "the contribution to the field integral from the field - amplitude domain where the higher - order terms dominate is small : the main contribution comes from the domain where the gaussian term prevails .",
    "generally , the gaussian approximation fails near the critical point , where the gaussian term of the effective hamiltonian becomes small and even vanishes @xcite . for the hcocp we do not expect any criticality and thus the gaussian approximation",
    "is expected to be valid .    to obtain the analytical expression for the equation of state we also approximate the fourier transform of the direct correlation function of the reference hard - core system @xmath57 by its small-@xmath62 expansion .",
    "although such approximation deviates from the actual dependence of @xmath57 at larger @xmath62 , this does not eventually affect the equation of state : owing to the long - range nature of the coulombic interactions , only the small-@xmath62 behavior of @xmath57 is important ; this is correctly reproduced by the approximation .",
    "we also analyse the validity of the widely used approximation , where the free energy of the hcocp is represented as a sum of the hard - core and electrostatic component .",
    "we show that such approximation is rather accurate for small packing fraction and large plasma parameter . in the opposite case of large @xmath13 and small @xmath0 the excess free energy",
    "may not be adequately represented by a sum of a hard - core and electrostatic part .                                                                                      to obtain eq.([q_start ] ) we take into account that @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are respectively the real ( cosine ) and imaginary ( sine ) parts of @xmath133 . similar relation for @xmath134 is used , to obtain eq.([q_fin ] ) .",
    "the direct correlation function for the hard sphere fluid reads @xcite : @xmath135 , when @xmath136 and @xmath137 when @xmath138 , where @xmath76 is the diameter of the hard spheres . for @xmath57 , which may be easily found from @xmath79 we do not need the complete expression .",
    "the maximal deviation between the free energy evaluated with the full expression for @xmath139 and with the quadratic expansion is approximately @xmath140 and occurs at a packing fraction of @xmath141 and a plasma parameter @xmath142 . for all other values of the parameter , the deviations are smaller .",
    "the value of @xmath68 may be obtained directly as the zero - order moment of the wertheim - thiele solution for @xmath79 @xcite of the hard - sphere fluid .",
    "this is however based on the approximate percus - yevik closure @xcite and occurs to be less accurate than that related to @xmath143 , with @xmath143 taken from the carnahan - starling compressibility .",
