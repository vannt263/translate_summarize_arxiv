    "whether brown dwarfs form as stars from bottom - up accretion or as planets from a pre - stellar disk is still a matter of debate .",
    "the necessary conditions for the formation of brown dwarfs require high density regions and low jeans mass in the natal gas , as well as limited mass accretion after the onset of collapse .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain these scenarios .",
    "these include ejection of pre - stellar cores  @xcite , photo erosion of pre - stellar cores  @xcite , disk fragmentation  @xcite and turbulent fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "a good way of determining the relative occurrence of these formation theories is by studying multiplicity .",
    "the shape of the separation , mass ratio and eccentricity distributions is a direct consequence of the mechanisms that resulted in brown dwarf formation  @xcite .",
    "while direct imaging has been the most prolific observational method to identify binaries ( 73% of confirmed systems  ) , its inherent limit in spatial resolution suggests incompleteness . for a typical field brown dwarf at a distance of @xmath2pc , the best angular resolution that can be achieved with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) or the keck ii telescope using adaptive optics ( ao ) is @xmath3 , leading to a projected separation of @xmath4au , which brackets the peak of the observed distribution ( figure  [ fig : sepdist ] ) .",
    "it is possible that this concurrence is a consequence of the limit in imaging resolution rather than a real peak .",
    "an alternative , separation - independent method to identify tightly - bound binaries is to look at their unresolved , blended - light spectra .",
    "we will use the term _ spectral binaries _ for those objects whose combined - light spectrum shows distinct peculiarities that arise when the highly structured nir spectra of single m , l and t dwarfs are combined together . in this study",
    "we adapt the technique of  @xcite to search for spectral binaries composed of late - m or early - l primaries and t dwarf secondaries . since m dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy as well as the brightest vlm objects , and because their spectra are decidedly different from the spectral of t dwarfs , binaries composed of these spectral types are excellent candidates for identification as spectral binaries .",
    "in addition , binaries with a late - m / early - l primary and a t dwarf secondary can straddle the hydrogen burning limit , making them interesting probes for brown dwarf thermal evolution .",
    "spectral binaries can be identified by visual inspection , using spectral indices and spectral fitting .",
    "the peculiar features that strongly suggest binarity in nir spectra with late - m / early - l and t components are :    * additional flux ( as compared to a single object of the same spectral type ) in the @xmath5-band at @xmath6 m , coming from the t dwarf companion ; * a small dip in the @xmath7-band at @xmath8 m , resulting from overlapping ch@xmath9 ( t dwarf ) and feh ( m dwarf ) absorption features ; and * an inflated bump in the @xmath10-band shortward of @xmath11 m , also coming from the flux from the t dwarf .    from a sample of @xmath12 m7-l7 brown dwarfs near - infrared ( nir )",
    "spectra from the spex prism libraries  @xcite which excludes poor quality spectra , giants , and optical subdwarfs , we identified 35 candidates through visual inspection and spectral indices .",
    "we designed spectral indices that target the features described above , indices previously defined  @xcite colors and spectral type for a total of seventeen parameters .",
    "the parameters were compared against each other to select regions where it would be likely to find other binaries guided by four binary benchmarks ( see figure  [ fig : indices ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we conducted single and binary template fitting on the 35 candidates , using a chi - squared minimization routine and an f - test to compare the single and binary fits ( see figure  [ fig : spexbinaryfit ] ) . out of the 35 candidates ,",
    "18 showed a confidence @xmath13 that a binary template reproduced the spectra better than a single template . for four sources we deemed their peculiar - looking spectra",
    "be due to their blue colors , instead of binarity , so they were rejected . the final count yielded 14 binary candidates .",
    "after performing a kolmigorov - smirnov test comparing the separations of a subsample of six confirmed spectral binaries to the rest of the binary samplepc , and within angular separations of @xmath14mas . ] , we find a probability of 25% that the spectral binary subsample does not belong to the greater binary sample suggesting that the peak may be a selection effect .",
    "given the small number statistics , confirmation of the remaining 43 spectral binary candidates is needed .    0846 , 2mass j1341@xmath13052 and sdss j0805 + 4812 .",
