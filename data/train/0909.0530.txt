    "@xcite is accredited with a description of the transition to turbulence through a sequence of instabilities that add spatial and temporal degrees of freedom to the flow , thereby building up the complex dynamics which characterise turbulent motion .",
    "such a scenario seems to be realised in fluids heated from below ( rayleigh - bnard ) or in centrifugally unstable situations ( taylor - couette ) @xcite , but it does not apply to several important flows like pressure driven flow down a circular pipe @xcite or plane couette flow @xcite , since already the first step of the classical scenario , the linear instability of the laminar profile , is missing . accordingly , triggering turbulence in these linearly stable flows requires that both the flow rate _ and _ the strength of an applied perturbation exceed critical levels @xcite . several experimental @xcite and numerical studies @xcite have focused on the required minimal perturbations and have identified a very sensitive dependence of the critical amplitudes on both the spatial structure of a perturbation and on the flow rate .",
    "> from a dynamical systems point of view , the coexistence of the stable laminar profile with turbulent dynamics implies that there is a boundary in the state space of the system which separates perturbations that return to the laminar profile from those that become turbulent @xcite . the sensitive dependence on initial conditions results in a fractal and convoluted boundary which was termed _",
    "edge of chaos _",
    "@xcite . it generalises the more familiar basin boundary to situations where turbulence might be transient @xcite . despite its intricate geometry the edge",
    "is locally formed by the stable set of an invariant dynamical object called _",
    "edge state_. by definition , the edge state corresponds to a self - sustained non - laminar and non - decaying flow field of critical energy .",
    "its stable manifold is of co - dimension one per construction and defines locally the stability boundary .",
    "therefore , the edge state together with its stable manifold determines minimal seeds for turbulence .",
    "both the exact solutions that have been linked to the turbulent dynamics @xcite and the edge states @xcite which guide the transition have been studied in small computational domains subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , they focus on the temporal degrees of freedom but can not capture large scale spatial phenomena such as the growth of turbulent regions or the coexistence of turbulent and non - turbulent patterns observed in spatially extended systems . the spatial dynamics of extended flow systems shows up in transition experiments where the homogeneously driven flow is locally perturbed by a jet injection @xcite or a small obstacle @xcite : in such cases one first observes a localised turbulent region which then starts to spread out @xcite .",
    "the spatially extended edge states can not explain these phenomena , since they would require that the perturbation exceeds the critical threshold everywhere in space , in contrast to the experimental evidence .",
    "studies on pipe flow , both in a model @xcite and in the fully resolved direct numerical simulations @xcite have identified an edge state that is localised along the axis . in the present study",
    "we apply these ideas and tools to the case of plane couette flow , where there are two directions of spatial extension , streamwise and spanwise . using direct numerical simulations",
    "we show that these edge states can be localised in one or both directions , thereby confirming the expectation that a localised perturbation should be sufficient to nucleate turbulence .",
    "moreover , we find tantalising similarities to observations in typical pattern forming systems @xcite .",
    "as usual , we define the reynolds number for plane couette flow as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is half the velocity differences between the two plates , @xmath2 is half the gap width @xmath2 and @xmath3 the viscosity of the fluid . in the following all lengths will be given in units of @xmath2 .",
    "the system is transitionally invariant in both the streamwise ( @xmath4 ) and spanwise ( @xmath5 ) direction .",
    "the laminar linear flow profile is stable against infinitesimal perturbations for all @xmath6 @xcite . in the turbulent case",
    "the translational symmetries are broken : localised turbulent patches of irregular shapes and various sizes which are surrounded by laminar regions can be observed for @xmath6 above about 320 @xcite .",
    "the systems also allows for more ordered patterns of turbulent stripes which arise for a small range of parameters near @xmath7 and were reproduced in numerical simulations @xcite . for these @xmath6 localised perturbations are observed to generate localised turbulent spots that invade the surrounding laminar flow @xcite .    as in previous studies in small periodic domains ,",
    "we determine the edge state by numerically tracking the evolution of velocity fields which neither become fully turbulent nor decay to laminar flow but remain in regions intermediate between these two types of dynamics @xcite . for the numerical simulation we use the fourier - chebyshev - tau scheme developed by @xcite with a resolution of 33 modes in normal direction . in the other directions ,",
    "we adjust the number of modes when varying the size of the domain so that we keep @xmath8 modes per length in the spanwise and @xmath9 or @xmath10 modes per length in the downstream direction .",
    "one might expect that computing _ localised _ edge states requires a control not only on the perturbation energy but also on the spatial extension of a flow structure .",
    "however , as became clear in hindsight and will be demonstrated below , the evolution of these states is such that no additional control is needed and that the numerical algorithm described before @xcite can be used without modification .    .",

    "the presence of two locally attracting travelling waves on the edge calls for an explanation of how the their stable manifolds and the two local boundaries between laminar and turbulent dynamics which they define can be sewed together .",
    "the simplest explanation ( following the bifurcation scenarios discussed in @xcite ) requires the existence of a relative saddle in the edge which has an unstable direction pointing to either of the states .",
    "the broken up - down symmetry of the travelling waves then suggests that such a state should be symmetric .",
    "a newton search starting from a suitably tailored initial condition indeed converges to the symmetric and stationary state shown in fig .",
    "[ figux14uxtot ] ( a ) .",
    "its eigenvalue spectrum shows the second unstable eigenvalue required to connect it to the travelling waves via a symmetry breaking bifurcation .",
    "indeed , following both the travelling wave and the stationary state down to a reynolds number close to 150.2 , they merge .",
    "however , when approaching this point , the widths of the states increases ( cf .",
    "[ re_dependent ] ) , until they extend over the full domain near the bifurcation point .",
    "this is documented in fig .",
    "[ bif_diag ] , where we characterise the states using a specially tailored measure of the energy content .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 is calculated from the energy difference between the state and its mirror image in the spanwise direction so that it amplifies the difference between the two localised states and shows the reduction in energy when they become localised .",
    "one notes that as the reynolds number is reduced , all three solutions converge near @xmath24 , showing that both the symmetric and antisymmetric localised state emerge out of the spatially extended equilibrium .",
    "similar localisation phenomena have been observed in homoclinic snaking scenarios @xcite .",
    "the similarities in phenomenology are remarkable , and become particularly clear when the flow variations in downstream direction are averaged out and only the spanwise velocity averaged in @xmath4 and @xmath25 is shown : according to the symmetries of the full 3-d velocity fields the averaged velocities come in patterns of either reflection or a point mirror symmetry , as shown in the insets in fig .",

    "remarkably , the localised patterns in the 1-d swift - hohenberg model with cubic - quintic nonlinearity show the same symmetries .",
    "we also noticed that the states in the swift - hohenberg model and the ones obtained here can be scaled and superimposed to look almost identical : while such a quantitative agreement can not be expected because of the different form of the equations from which they are obtained , it does underline the strong similarities between the two systems , thereby pointing to a similar localisation mechanism .",
    "turning to domains that are @xmath12 wide but much longer than @xmath13 we find edge states that are localised in the downstream direction .",
    "however , their length falls off rather slowly , so that for @xmath7 , where the length is about 60 to 80 , boxes of a length @xmath26 had to be used before localisation could be seen .",
    "as in the wide box this edge state is dominated by streaks but it is neither a fixed point nor a travelling wave but shows constant internal dynamics similar to the chaotic edge state found in pipe flow @xcite . also the localisation in downstream direction is not unlike the one seen in models and in full numerical simulations for pipe flow @xcite .    .",

    "note the exponential localisation in downstream direction and the faster than exponential one in spanwise direction . ]    increasing both the width and length of the computational domain to 128 times the area of the reference domain , the edge tracking algorithm converges to a structure that is fully localised in span- and streamwise direction .",

    "the visual appearance including the tails of the structures is a bit larger , about @xmath31 .",
    "the localised state shows a streaky structure and combines the localisation features observed in long but narrow and in short but wide domains : it is exponentially localised in streamwise direction ( fig .",

    "[ figux168a_41uxcolor]c ) .",
    "data for different independent edge state calculations starting from different initial conditions and computed with varying domain sizes and differing numerical resolution has been included in those figures .",
    "the overlap of the data shows that both spatial extensions and energy distributions are dynamically selected and independent of the size of the computational domain , the numerical resolution and the initial condition .",
    "the fully localised edge state is not stationary or a travelling wave but shows chaotic temporal and spatial variations . as for the edge states identified in short segments of pipe flow @xcite , the mild chaotic variations can be clearly distinguished from turbulence because of their limited variability in space and energy , and their fairly slow dynamics .    ,",

    "the significance of the localised edge state lies in their finite size which defines the length , width and topology of marginally self - sustained perturbations .",
    "they are the smallest self - sustained structures away from the laminar profile and are critical in the sense that weaker perturbations will decay and stronger ones will increase to become turbulent . in the full state space of the system",
    "it is their stable manifold that separates laminar from turbulent dynamics .",
    "interestingly , the size of this edge state is also very close to the minimal spot size required to stimulate growth at constant front velocity determined experimentally in @xcite .    the dynamical relevance of these localised edge states for the transition is further clarified in fig .",

    "the flow becomes turbulent the time traces of the spatial extension ( length and width ) and of the energy density stored in the perturbation field reveal two stages of the transition process : first the energy increases while maintaining the size of the spot , and only once the interior has reached turbulence levels does it start to grow in width and length .",
    "thus , the structure has to become turbulent locally before it can start to fill the domain .",
    "incidentally , this property of the localised structures explains why they can be detected and determined by monitoring the energy only : the alternative path by which energy could increase , namely by spreading in space while keeping the local energy density of the edge state , does not happen .",
    "we have computed the energetically minimal self - sustained perturbations in extended plane couette flow and shown that they are spatially localised .",
    "these states are naturally related to earlier turbulence transition studies in which localised perturbations of a fixed type were used to generate growing turbulent spots @xcite .",
    "the experimental results in @xcite together with the numerical studies in @xcite show that a perturbation has to exceed a critical amplitude in order to generate a constantly growing spot .",
    "remarkably , these studies also suggest that the critical perturbations are dominated by downstream vortices of size and topology very similar to the edge state shown in fig .",
    "[ figux168a_41uxcolor ] .",
    "this further supports the significance of localised edge states as nuclei for the transition dynamics .",
    "the internal dynamics of the localised edge states can be complicated : in a wide but short domain they are travelling waves ( cf . fig .  1 ) of a topology similar to the non - localised edge states found in small periodically continued domains .",
    "in a wide and long domain the critical state is temporally active but shows a very limited spatial complexity when compared to a turbulent flow field .",
    "these observations together with the 2-d map studied in @xcite suggest that the relative attractor in the edge can be as simple or as complicated as a regular attractor in the full state space .",
    "the localization properties discussed here introduce a new length scale to the system : comparing the observations of localised critical structures in plane couette flow and pipe flow one notes that in both cases the structures have a localisation length that is much larger than the intrinsic structures of the edge states in the small domain , but that is shorter than the diameter of turbulent patches . in principle , models of front dynamics ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) could help here , but their derivation starting from the navier - stokes equation remains a challenge .",
    "aspects of the spatial evolution of turbulent patches in spatially extended systems have been considered by @xcite , who suggested that the transition could have similarities to nucleation phenomena in first order equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "it is well know that in such cases a sufficiently strong perturbation is needed to induce the transition from one phase to the other .",
    "for instance , water droplets in a saturated water vapour dissolve if they are too small , and grow rapidly once they are sufficiently big .",
    "the same behaviour can be observed in the localised structures discussed here : if they are too weak or too small , they decay , and only if they exceed the relevant thresholds do they increase and spread .",
    "@xcite proposed that there should be an appropriate non - equilibrium generalisation of the equilibrium phase - transition problem .",
    "the localised edge states shown here seem to be this non - equilibrium equivalent of the critical size droplets , and could be important for other aspects of the spatio - temporal dynamics in large domain turbulence as well @xcite .",
