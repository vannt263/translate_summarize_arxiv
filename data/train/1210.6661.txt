    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) is believed to be the primary mechanism for driving accretion in a wide range of astrophysical disks by generating turbulence to provide outward angular momentum transport .",
    "the robustness of the mri and its physical properties have been widely studied by means of both local shearing box simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and global simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "local shearing - box simulations have the advantages of being able to achieve high resolution at modest computational cost , and are the primary way for exploring the detailed physics of the mri .",
    "four types of shearing - box mri simulations exist , depending on whether vertical gravity from the central object ( which gives density stratification ) is included and whether the simulations include net vertical magnetic flux .",
    "while unstratified mri simulations provide important benchmarks on the physical properties of the mri turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , real disks involve vertical density stratification .",
    "so far most vertically stratified shearing - box simulations focus on a magnetic field configuration with zero net vertical magnetic flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the inclusion of net vertical magnetic field in stratified shearing - box simulations , which is probably closer to reality , has only been rarely explored , most likely due to numerical difficulties @xcite : either the numerical code crashes or the disk is violently disrupted in a few orbits .",
    "more and more attention has been drawn to this least explored regime of stratified shearing - box with net vertical flux in the recent years .",
    "this is partly due to the improvement of the numerical schemes , but more importantly , the physical significance of the mri in this regime and its intimate connections to astrophysical applications make it deserve more detailed study . in particular , the presence of jets and outflows in a wide range of accretion systems such as protostars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , x - ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) and active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) is indicative of the presence of large - scale ( poloidal ) magnetic field threading through the disk , which is essential for jet / outflow acceleration and collimation via the magnetocentrifugal mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite successfully conducted stratified shearing - box simulations that include net vertical magnetic field with an outflow boundary condition using characteristic decomposition . their net vertical field ,",
    "characterized by @xmath0 ( ratio of gas to magnetic pressure at midplane ) , is rather weak ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "they reported the launching of disk outflow and found that the averaged mass outflow rate increases linearly with the magnetic pressure of the net vertical field .",
    "it was speculated that the outflow serves as the base of a blandford - payne type magneto - centrifugal wind . in this paper , we conduct shearing - box simulations of the mri that include a relatively strong net vertical magnetic flux , with @xmath13 which has largely been unexplored in the literature . the main motivation of our work is two - fold as we elaborate below .",
    "first , we aim at studying the properties of the mri turbulence in more realistic magnetic field geometry and their dependence on the net poloidal magnetic flux threading through accretion disks",
    ". in particular , how the shakura - sunyaev @xmath7 parameter , which is of the most common interest , depends on the net magnetic flux . due to the vast dominance of zero net vertical flux stratified shearing - box simulations ,",
    "the @xmath7 parameter has been taken for granted to be of the order @xmath14 , while the @xmath7 value inferred from observations of fully ionized disks is at least an order of magnitude higher ( e.g. , see discussions by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unstratifed shearing - box simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) unambiguously found that as long as the most unstable linear mri mode fits into the simulation domain , the turbulent stress increases roughly linearly with @xmath15 . it is natural to expect the same trend in stratified shearing - box simulations , hence net vertical magnetic flux is likely to be a crucial ingredient in real accretion disks .",
    "moreover , as in the zero net - flux cases , we expect buoyancy and open vertical boundaries in our stratified simulations to give rise to novel features on the properties of the mri turbulence , particularly the mri dynamo and the generation of large - scale fields @xcite .",
    "second , our study will address the potential connection between the mri and the magneto - centrifugal wind ( mcw , @xcite ) .",
    "the mcw extracts both mass and angular momentum from accretion disks , and is a competing mechanism for driving disk accretion and evolution .",
    "while the wind acceleration and collimation of the mcw is largely known , the wind launching process which loads mass from the disk onto the wind is still not well understood .",
    "most semi - analytical works and numerical simulations either assume a razor - thin disk treated as a boundary condition with artificial mass injection ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or proceed with unresolved disk by adopting some forms of artificial diffusion , ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such diffusion , which presumably arises from the mri , is necessary to allow the gas to slide through the disk that avoids rapid accumulation of magnetic flux to maintain steady state accretion .",
    "however , the microphysics ( e.g. , the mri ) within the accretion disk , which is crucial for wind launching , is not modeled directly .",
    "in fact , it is numerically very challenging to properly resolve the mri turbulence in global wind simulations , which requires extended three - dimensional computational domain with large numerical resolution .",
    "on the other hand , local shearing - box simulations provide superb resolution with realistic computational cost , hence are a powerful tool for studying the wind launching process from first principle .",
    "recently , @xcite conducted a series of stratified shearing - box mri simulations with @xmath16 .",
    "after carefully examining various numerical issues , they reported simultaneous mri turbulence and launching of an mcw , whereas angular momentum transport is still dominated by the mri rather than the mcw . in parallel , @xcite conducted a series of stratified shearing - box simulations in both one - dimension and three - dimensions with @xmath17 , where the most unstable linear mri modes just marginally fit into the disk .",
    "they found that such mri modes directly produce magnetically driven outflows , which are time varying due to secondary instabilities .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite studied the wind launching process in two - dimensional shearing - box simulations with @xmath18 ( where mri is suppressed ) and found long - wavelength ",
    "clump \" instability for @xmath19 and speculated its connection to the mass - flux instability found in earlier analytical works @xcite .",
    "our simulations fill the gap in parameter space explored by these authors and reveal the interesting transition from the mri - dominated transport to potentially wind - dominated transport .",
    "together with the earlier semi - analytical study of wind launching by @xcite , which applies to the regime of @xmath19 , as well as the simulations by @xcite , which applies to @xmath20 , the series of studies cover the complete parameter range relevant to mri turbulence and wind launching in realistic accretion disks under the local shearing - box framework .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : method ] we describe the methodology and setup of our simulations .",
    "we present our simulation results in section [ sec : results ] , focusing on the properties of the mri and angular momentum transport , and section [ sec : wind ] , focusing on the dynamics of the outflow and its connection to global disk winds .",
    "each result section is broken into three subsections , devoting to one aspect of the results .",
    "implications of our results for global disk evolution are discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] before we conclude .",
    "we use the athena magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) code @xcite and perform three - dimensional ( 3d ) local mhd simulations of gas dynamics using the shearing - box approach @xcite .",
    "ideal mhd equations are written in a cartesian coordinate system in the corotating frame at a fiducial radius @xmath21 with keplerian frequency @xmath22 , with @xmath23 denoting unit vectors pointing to the radial , azimuthal and vertical directions respectively , and @xmath24 is along the @xmath25 direction .",
    "the mhd equations read @xmath26 @xmath27\\ , \\label{eq : gasmotion}\\ ] ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total stress tensor @xmath30 @xmath31 is the gas density , @xmath32 is the gas velocity .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state @xmath33 . note that the unit for magnetic field is such that the magnetic pressure equals @xmath34 , which avoids the extra factor of @xmath35 . the vertical gravity from the central object ( @xmath36 )",
    "is included in the momentum equation hence our simulations have vertical density stratification .",
    "the shearing - box source terms ( coriolis force and tidal gravity ) have been readily implemented in athena @xcite .",
    "an orbital advection scheme is adopted where the system is split into an advective part that corresponds to the background shear flow @xmath37 , and the other part that only evolve the velocity fluctuations @xmath38 : @xmath39 most of our analysis deals with @xmath38 , except in the study of conservation laws along field lines , where @xmath32 will also be used ( see section [ sssec : conslaw ] ) .",
    "we use standard shearing - box boundary conditions in the radial direction @xcite . in the vertical direction , we adopt a simple zero - gradient outflow boundary condition for velocities and magnetic fields , with density extrapolated assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite . in addition , vertical velocity in the ghost cells is set to zero in the case of inflow .",
    "it was pointed out that strict zero - gradient boundary condition ( including zero vertical density gradient ) would prevent mhd - driven outflow @xcite , while we find that the outflow can be launched once a vertical density gradient is present at the interface of the vertical boundary .",
    "it is well known that in the presence of pure vertical background magnetic field , the linear mri modes consist of counter - motions in the radial direction that alternate along the vertical direction ( i.e. , the channel flow ) .",
    "the channel flow is an exact solution of the mhd equations even in the non - linear regime provided that the magnetic field remains sub - thermal @xcite .",
    "it can achieve very large amplitude before broken up by parasitic instabilities @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the mri modes in the presence of vertical stratification and their parasitic instabilities .",
    "they found that the channel modes strongly amplify the magnetic fields to thermal strength before they can be destroyed . on the simulation side , the channel flows in the initial stage of the simulations not only place enormous demands on numerical codes , but also give rise to eruptive behavior that depletes the disk in just a few orbits @xcite . in view of the transient nature of the channel flow , as well as its large numerical demand ,",
    "we initialize our simulations in a way that strong channel flow can be avoided , as described below .",
    "fiducially , we use a box size of ( @xmath40 ) in ( @xmath41 ) resolved by ( @xmath42 ) grid points , where @xmath43 is the thermal scale height .",
    "the relatively large horizontal box size is necessary to properly capture the mesoscale structures of the mri turbulence such as the zonal flow @xcite .",
    "the initial density profile is taken to be gaussian @xmath44 .",
    "we use natural unit in our simulations , with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we initialize our simulations with zero net vertical magnetic flux configuration , i.e. , a weak vertical magnetic field that varies sinusoidally in the radial ( @xmath49 ) direction .",
    "we run the zero net - flux simulation to @xmath50 when turbulence is fully developed , then we start to add net vertical magnetic flux , which is applied uniformly in the grid ( hence it does not introduce any divergence error ) and the amount added is proportional to the time step d@xmath51 .",
    "this process continues to @xmath52 when the net vertical magnetic field strength reaches the desired level @xmath53 , characterized by midplane plasma @xmath54 .",
    "the simulations are run for about another 150 orbits to @xmath55 .    for our simulations , we consider @xmath1 and @xmath2 , corresponding to runs b2 , b3 and b4 . ignoring vertical stratification , the most most unstable mri wavelength at disk midplane is about @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "including vertical stratification , calculations by @xcite suggest resolution of about 25 cells per @xmath57 for @xmath6 , and 50 cells per @xmath57 for @xmath58 , to properly resolve the mri channel modes .",
    "our fiducial resolution meets this criterion for @xmath6 . for @xmath59",
    ", we conduct an additional simulation ( run b3-hr ) with twice the resolution which then does properly resolve the most unstable linear modes . for this run ,",
    "we initialize the simulation with full a net vertical magnetic flux , together with a sinusoidally varying vertical field component so as to avoid an excessively strong initial channel flow .",
    "the list of simulation runs is provided in table [ tab : runs ] .",
    ".summary of simulation runs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "note : all in natural units , with @xmath60 .    integrating the stresses one",
    "obtain the @xmath7 parameter defined in ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) , and the results are listed in table [ tab : amt ] .",
    "the @xmath7 parameter increases monotonically with net magnetic flux , from a total of about @xmath61 for @xmath16 to @xmath62 for @xmath6 , the ratio of @xmath63 to @xmath64 increases from about 4 for @xmath16 , which is similar to that in zero net vertical flux simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , to about 7 for @xmath65 , which is mainly due to an increasing contribution from the mean ( rather than turbulent ) magnetic field .",
    "we note that in run b2 , the maxwell stress only decreases very slowly with height , while the reynolds stress even increases with height , making the volume integrated stress limited by the vertical extent of our simulation box .",
    "however , we argue that increasing the box size does not necessarily improve the situation . in this case ,",
    "the radial angular momentum transport is dominated by the mean field and mean flow . as we shall discuss in section [ sec : wind ] , the strength of the large - scale mean field at disk surface is intimately connected to the global condition of the disk and can not be determined in the local shearing - box approch .",
    "therefore , uncertainty still remains as one uses a taller box .",
    "the measured @xmath66 value for run b2 should be only taken as a reference .",
    "angular momentum can also be extracted from the disk directly in the vertical direction through outflow and magnetic fields , which is determined by the @xmath67 components of the reynolds and maxwell stresses exerted at vertical boundaries @xmath68 where in practice subscripts @xmath69 and @xmath70 mean that we measure these quantities at the last layer of the top and bottom of the computational domain .",
    "the torque exerted by the wind stresses can be obtained by simply multiplying @xmath71 and @xmath72 by the radius @xmath21 .",
    "including the contributions from radial and vertical transports , the accretion rate can be approximately written as is independent of radius .",
    "this corresponds to equation ( 18 ) of @xcite with @xmath73 . ]",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent contributions to the accretion rate from radial and vertical transport respectively .",
    "qualitatively , one may replace the vertical integral @xmath77 by the disk scale height @xmath57 .",
    "we see that given the same level of stress @xmath78 and @xmath79 , vertical transport is more efficient than radial transport by a factor of about @xmath80 .",
    "being a local shearing - box simulation , however , @xmath21 is unspecified , and moreover , the location of the central object is unspecified ( can either at inner or outer @xmath81 direction ) , making the sign of @xmath21 ambiguous .",
    "a physical disk wind requires that the sign of @xmath79 on the two vertical boundaries be the opposite and are steady , and is closely related to the symmetry of the wind solution as we will discuss in detail in section [ ssec : fate ] . in this subsection , we only consider the absolute value of @xmath79 and average it over the two vertical boundaries ( i.e. , assuming the flow structure and magnetic configuration has the physical geometry ) that the outflow is unlikely to be _ directly _ connected to an ordered disk wind mainly due to geometric reasons .",
    "let us set aside the issue with outflow geometry here for the purpose of discussion .",
    "] , hence the relative importance between radial and vertical transport can be rewritten as @xmath82    we list the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 from each simulation run in table [ tab : amt ] , with both normalized by @xmath85 .",
    "the wind stresses appear to depend more sensitively on @xmath0 , and increase by about two orders of magnitude from @xmath4 to @xmath86 .",
    "this may suggest the importance of wind transport relatively to turbulent transport increases with net vertical field .",
    "taking @xmath87 , we find that wind transport , if present , should be small ( less than @xmath88 ) compared with radial transport for @xmath16 , which is consistent with the results by @xcite .",
    "it would become more or less comparable to radial transport for @xmath59 , while it would dominate radial transport for @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , the contributions from maxwell @xmath84 and reynolds @xmath83 components are roughly @xmath89 in runs b3 and b4 , while the reynolds component becomes more important for run b2 .",
    "however again , as we shall discuss in section [ sec : wind ] , the wind stress can only determined from global approach , while our measured @xmath90 values should also be taken as a reference .",
    "using an isothermal equation of state , total energy is not conserved in the simulation .",
    "however , it is important to examine the energy budget for consistency such that the work done by the keplerian shear ( i.e. , from radial shearing - box boundaries ) exceeds the energy loss from the vertical boundaries , with the rest of the energy presumably escape from the disk in the form of radiation .    in ideal mhd ,",
    "the energy flux is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the internal energy .",
    "consider the net energy flux entering the two sides of the radial boundaries , where we compute @xmath93 and integrate over height and azimuth .",
    "note that @xmath32 contains background shear , and one should shift @xmath94 by @xmath95 between the two boundaries .",
    "correspondingly , only terms containing @xmath32 contribute , while all other terms cancel due to the shear - periodic boundary condition .",
    "the non - vanishing terms turn out to be maxwell and reynolds stress , and the work done by the radial boundaries per unit horizontal area per unit time read @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the column density .",
    "the energy loss from vertical boundaries is given by @xmath98\\cdot{{\\boldsymbol}n}\\bigg|_{\\rm top+bot}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the unit vector pointing away from the disk in the vertical direction , and we sum over contributions from the top and bottom vertical boundaries .",
    "the first terms in the bracket represent the kinetic energy loss and the @xmath100 work done by the mass outflow , and the second term represents energy loss from the poynting flux . rather than @xmath38 in equation ( [ eq : edot ] )",
    ". however , linear terms that contain background shear should vanish over space and time average .",
    "the quadratic term that contains background shear corresponds to the kinetic energy of the keplerian profile , which is compensated exactly by the addition of mass to the simulation domain .",
    "] we have ignored the energy loss term associated with internal energy due to the mass outflow , since we keep feeding mass to the system which balances this term exactly .",
    "this term is comparable to the @xmath100 work term which , as we shall see , is always small compared with the total @xmath101 ( hence our mass addition do not substantially alter the energy balance ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : amt ] we also list the values of @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , normalized in natural units . we see that @xmath102 is always larger than the sum of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , hence energy conservation is not violated .",
    "also , we see that @xmath104 is always larger than @xmath103 by a factor of about @xmath105 to @xmath106 , hence poynting flux dominates energy loss . in addition , under the assumption of isothermal equation of state adopted in our simulations , we find that as net vertical magnetic field increases , @xmath107 roughly increases as @xmath15 , which is much faster than the rate @xmath102 increases .",
    "this may suggest radiative efficiency decreases as a larger fraction of work done by the shear is converted into the wind energy loss .",
    "it is well known in stratified shearing - box simulations with zero net vertical magnetic flux that the mean toroidal field component experiences periodic flips on the time scale of @xmath108 orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since a zero background vertical field does not give any instability on its own in the linear theory , the mri activity in these simulations together with the periodic flips strongly suggest that a magnetic dynamo is in operation .",
    "it is generally believed that shear , turbulence and large scale azimuthal field are responsible for sustaining the dynamo cycles @xcite , yet the detailed mechanism remains unsettled .    in the presence of net vertical magnetic field , the mri can be sustained from the linear modes hence a dynamo is not necessary to explain the turbulence . with very weak vertical net magnetic flux , dynamo behavior",
    "was also observed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , whose simulations correspond to @xmath109 , although it was not studied in detail .",
    "our simulations allow us to systematically study the evolution of the mri dynamo with net vertical magnetic flux . in figure",
    "[ fig : dynamo ] , we show the space - time plot of the horizontally averaged azimuthal magnetic field for all our simulation runs .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath16 , the mean azimuthal field still undergoes cyclic oscillations between positive and negative signs , while for @xmath6 , the dynamo behavior disappears , where the mean azimuthal field in the entire simulation box is completely dominated by one sign at all times .",
    "the case with @xmath59 is somewhat marginal , where the dynamo - like behavior is present for part of the time while for the rest of the time the mean azimuthal field is predominantly one sign .    in zero net vertical flux stratified shearing - box simulations ( see figure 15 of @xcite for a most clear rendering ) , the dynamo pattern is highly repeatable in the space - time plot , also known as the  butterfly diagram \" , with a well - defined of period about 10 orbits .",
    "the dynamo cycles in our run b4 with @xmath16 , however , is highly irregular .",
    "such behavior is also observed in @xcite . further including the marginal case of run b3 with @xmath59",
    ", we see that there is a systematic trend that as net vertical field increases , the dynamo cycle weakens by becoming more irregular with less periodicity .",
    "the flipping of mean azimuthal field becomes more sporadic , and the mean time interval for field flipping also becomes longer .",
    "as @xmath0 reaches below @xmath110 , the flipping time interval virtually becomes infinity , and the dynamo is completely quenched .",
    "we note that the most unstable linear mri mode is properly resolved in run b2 , which does not show dynamo behavior , but may not be well resolved in runs b3 and b4 , which show dynamo activities .",
    "hence question arises on whether the dynamo activity depends on the proper resolution of the linear mri modes .",
    "our run b3-hr , which is the same as run b3 but properly resolves the most unstable mri mode , is designed to clarify this potential ambiguity .",
    "we see that the space - time pattern for the mean azimuthal field is very similar in the two runs : dynamo activity appears only part of the time .",
    "this comparison further justifies that the dynamo behaviors observed in our simulations are real .",
    "it is natural to ask about what physical effects control the dynamo activities .",
    "phenomenologically , we see that in the presence of the dynamo , the disk is separated into two distinct regions , namely the region near the midplane with relatively weak magnetic field where the dynamo appears to be developed , and a highly magnetized region outside . in figure",
    "[ fig : dynamo ] , we have overplotted white contours that mark the total plasma @xmath111 ( i.e. , total magnetic pressure equals the gas pressure ) . remarkably , these white contours perfectly separate the two regions for both runs b3 and b4 , while for run b2 , the entire disk is magnetically dominated hence there is no contour at all times .",
    "it is intriguing to notice that the dynamo is present whenever the magnetic field strength in the disk midplane region is below equipartition strength .",
    "meanwhile , the criterion of @xmath111 also applies to magnetic buoyancy ( i.e. , interchange and parker - type instabilities , @xcite ) as discussed in a number of zero net - flux simulations @xcite . with isothermal equation of state , and assuming zero mean vertical field , the fluid is buoyantly unstable if the magnetic energy density decreases with height @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the magnetic field strength tends to be constant in the gas pressure dominated disk midplane regions , presumably due to efficient turbulent mixing , while it falls off with height in the magnetically dominated corona .",
    "correspondingly , for regions with @xmath112 , the fluid is unstable due to magnetic buoyancy , while for regions with @xmath113 , the fluid is buoyantly ( marginally ) stable and dynamo activities produce cyclic alternations of the mean magnetic field .",
    "although the analysis of the parker instability in previous works assumes zero mean vertical field , it continues appear to be valid in our simulations with net vertical field , which is likely because the net vertical field in our simulations is much weaker ( by at least a factor of @xmath108 ) than the mean azimuthal field .",
    "the strong azimuthal magnetic field in our simulations with @xmath10 is to some extent similar to the simulations performed by @xcite .",
    "they initiated their simulations by a pure azimuthal field with equipartition strength ( with zero net vertical magnetic flux ) , and found that the interplay between the parker instability at disk surface layer and the mri near the midplane effectively produces a magnetic dynamo , and the azimuthal flux is well confined to the disk .",
    "simulations of @xcite for the tidal disruption of a molecular cloud approximately realize the situation .",
    "the key difference in our case is that a strong outflow is produced in the presence of net vertical magnetic field ( see section [ sec : wind ] ) , hence azimuthal flux continuously escape the simulation box and has to be continuously generated within the disk .",
    "therefore , although parker instability is likely to be present in the entire disk when @xmath10 , the dynamo mechanism of johansen & levin no longer operates in the presence of strong net vertical magnetic field . on the other hand , magnetic dissipation due to",
    "the parker instability is likely to play an important role on the thermal structure of the disk @xcite , which deserves future exploration .",
    "it has been found in @xcite and @xcite that the inclusion of a net vertical magnetic field leads to strong mass outflow in shearing - box mri simulations , and the rate of the mass outflow is approximately proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the mass outflow was interpreted as the launching of a wind from the disk and would potentially connect to a @xcite type global disk wind .",
    "the connection between mri - driven outflow and global disk wind has been further investigated by @xcite , who focused on the case with @xmath16 .",
    "they argue that the mri is able to launch the magnetocentrifugal wind that is strongly time - dependent .",
    "similar conclusion has been made by @xcite for the case with @xmath17 , where there is only one single mri mode fitted into the disk with a physical symmetry for the wind , and secondary instabilities are likely to make it time - dependent .",
    "very strong outflows are also observed in our simulations .",
    "however , we argue that the outflow seen in shearing - box mri simulations is unlikely to be directly connected to a global disk wind , as we elaborate below .        the global disk wind model by @xcite states that when",
    "the magnetic field at the surface of a thin disk is inclined relative to the disk normal for more than @xmath114 , outflowing gas can be accelerated centrifugally along field lines , extracting angular momentum from the disk , and is gradually collimated by the magnetic hoop stress",
    ". a crucial ingredient of this picture is the wind launching / mass loading from the disk , which is intrinsically connected to the gas dynamics in the disks .",
    "the wind launching process has been studied analytically under the local shearing - box approximation @xcite , where all the radial gradients except the shear are omitted to reduce the problem to fully one - dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "the 1d solutions are then matched to global wind solutions , where the mass loading rate is determined as an eigen - value problem .",
    "( solid ) , @xmath110 ( dashed ) @xmath2 ( dash - dotted ) respectively .",
    "also marked are the locations of alfvn points ( solid dots ) and slow magnetosonic points ( circles ) .",
    "the fast magnetosonic points are beyond the simulation domain.,width=283 ]    a physical wind solution should pass three critical points , namely , the slow and fast magnetosonic points , and the alfvn point . in the 1d ( laminar ) model , they are given by @xmath115 for fast and slow magnetosonic points , and @xmath116 for the alfvn point , where @xmath117 is the vertical component of the alfvn velocity , and @xmath118 is the full alfvn velocity .",
    "the requirement that the flow passes smoothly through these critical points poses three eigen - value problems that would determine three physical quantities , such as the mass loading rate and the field inclination at disk surface . in the local shearing - box approach ,",
    "the fast magnetosonic point , and sometimes the alfvn point , are sufficiently high above the disk where the local approximation no longer applies , and they need to be captured in the global models .",
    "the lack of one or two critical points implies that the solution obtained within the computational domain has one or two degrees of freedom .    in figure",
    "[ fig : criticalpts ] , we show the time and horizontally averaged profiles of the gas vertical velocity as a function of height . in all cases",
    ", the vertical velocity rapidly increases towards disk surface , and becomes transsonic or supersonic as the flow leaves the simulation box .",
    "we also calculate the location of the critical points based on equations ( [ eq : fastslow ] ) and ( [ eq : apoint ] ) , where the alfvn velocity is based on the time average of the absolute value of the horizontally averaged the magnetic field .",
    "we find that for all cases , the fast magnetosonic points are beyond our simulation box ( the fast magnetosonic speed is about @xmath119 or larger at vertical boundaries ) , while the alfvn ( marked in the figure ) and slow magnetosonic points are well contained in the box .",
    "this fact means that the flow structure is not fully determined and has one degree of freedom .",
    ", see equation [ eq : chi ] ) for all our simulation runs . bottom : time averaged mass loss rate from the simulation domain as a function of net vertical flux .",
    "thick / thin symbols correspond to fiducial / high resolution simulations ( b3-hr / b3).,width=283 ]    it is well known that for a laminar magnetized wind , the gas follows the magnetic field lines , and the flow is characterized by a number of conserved quantities along the streamlines @xcite .",
    "these conservation laws provide very useful diagnostics that help us understand the mechanism for the launching and acceleration of the outflow , as well as the angular momentum transfer processes .",

    "we show the profile of @xmath122 ( or @xmath121 ) for all our simulation runs in the top panel of figure [ fig : wind ] .",
    "because we constantly add mass to the simulation box to maintain steady state , the vertical profile of @xmath123 does not become flat until beyond @xmath124 .",

    "are conserved along streamlines . following @xcite ,",
    "the specific angular momentum reads @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the fluid part of the specific angular momentum .",
    "the partition between @xmath130 and @xmath131 then describes the angular momentum exchange between gas and magnetic field .",
    "energy conservation is given by the bernoulli invariant , which reads ( @xcite , without correction terms ) @xmath132 where @xmath133 represents the specific energy along a streamline , with the four terms denoting kinetic energy , enthalpy , potential energy and the work done by the magnetic torque , respectively , and @xmath134 note that the full velocity @xmath32 ( rather than @xmath38 ) enters @xmath135 , and the potential energy for the shearing - box is @xmath136    we extract the mean flow of the gas and integrate to obtain the streamline .",
    "because the disk midplane regions are generally the most turbulent with @xmath121 varying with height , we do not expect conservation laws to hold in these regions region and only trace streamlines from @xmath137 to @xmath138 , setting @xmath139 at @xmath137 ( note that by construction the conservation laws do not depend on the choice of the zero point of @xmath49 ) .",
    "this treatment covers the most interesting surface regions of the disk where the launching and acceleration of the outflow take place . for illustration purpose ,",
    "we only consider run b2 and b4 . for run b2 ,",
    "the large - scale flow and magnetic structures are more or less steady ( as seen from figure [ fig : dynamo ] ) , hence we take the long - term average to obtain the desired physical quantities along streamlines . for run b4 , due to the dynamo activities , we only pick up a short period between @xmath140 and @xmath141 , where the magnetic structure in the upper side of the disk is quasi - steady , as judged from figures [ fig : dynamo ] and [ fig : dynamo_bx ] .",

    "we see from the black dashed lines that energy and angular momentum are approximately conserved beyond about @xmath148 for both cases .",
    "the rise of the blue lines in the energy plots indicate flow acceleration .",
    "this is mostly compensated by the reduction of potential energy ( red ) and work done by the magnetic torque ( green ) .",
    "similarly , in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : conservation ] , we see that the increase of fluid angular momentum is compensated by the reduction of magnetic torque .",
    "therefore , it becomes clear that the acceleration is magnetocentrifugal in nature .",
    "note that the role played by centrifugal potential @xmath145 and the magnetic torque @xmath149 can be exchanged by shifting the zero point of @xmath49 , hence they represent the same effect .",
    "for example , if we were to trace the streamlines from the disk midplane for the case of run b2 , then we would found that the acceleration is almost completely due to the centrifugal potential , since for run b2 the poloidal field lines are almost always inclined for more than @xmath150 relative to disk normal , as can be seen in figure [ fig : bt100prof ] .      in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : wind ]",
    ", we show the total mass outflow rate @xmath151 measured from the two vertical boundaries for all our simulations , with the numbers given in table [ tab : amt ] .",
    "we see that @xmath125 scales roughly linearly with @xmath15 , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite , while extending the range of @xmath0 from @xmath2 in their case down to @xmath152 . from the definition of the alfvn point",
    ", the mass loss rate can be expressed as @xmath153 where @xmath154 denotes value at the alfvn point .",
    "a linear scaling of @xmath125 with @xmath15 indicates that @xmath155 at the alfvn point , which is in line with the fact that the location of the alfvn points decreases in height as net vertical field increases ( the change in density profile due to magnetic pressure support is not as significant ) .",
    "moreover , based on the same scaling , @xmath156 at the alfvn point is expected to be constant , which is roughly the case as seen from figure [ fig : criticalpts ] .      in figure",
    "[ fig : wind ] , we also indicate the scaling relation of @xmath125 with @xmath0 from @xcite .",
    "we find that while our measured @xmath125 follows the same trend , while our proportional coefficient is about a factor of @xmath157 smaller than theirs .",
    "besides that our vertical box size is slightly larger ( @xmath158 versus @xmath159 ) , this difference is mainly due to the different outflow boundary conditions implemented in our simulations from theirs .",
    "in fact , the rate of mass outflow @xmath125 is not a well determined quantity in local shearing - box type simulations because of the additional degree of freedom .",
    "moreover , in both @xcite and @xcite , it was found that @xmath125 decreases as the vertical size of the simulation box increases , which again suggests that @xmath125 can not be reliably obtained from shearing - box simulations .",
    "since the vertical gravity increases linearly with @xmath160 in shearing - box approximation , the gas has to overcome stronger and stronger potential well in order to flow out as box height increases . in reality , the vertical increases only as @xmath161 , where @xmath21 is the distance to the central object , hence shearing - box approximation fails at @xmath162 .",
    "@xcite considered higher order expansion of the real potential which would also require the radial potential to be modified to the same order .",
    "they noticed that this procedure would introduce curvature and no longer fit into the shearing - box framework .    the mass loss rate in real systems should be a well defined quantity , and we speculate that it should be comparable to the mass loss rate in shearing - box simulations performed with box size @xmath163 .",
    "suppose the mass outflow rate scales as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is a dimensionless constant , the index @xmath166 describes the scaling of @xmath125 on the box height , and we have assumed that @xmath167 as suggested by the simulations discussed in the previous subsection , with @xmath53 denoting the background vertical field strength . with a little algebra ,",
    "we find @xmath168 in particular , if @xmath169 ( s. fromang , 2011 , private communication ) , then our hypothesis ( @xmath170 ) yields @xmath171 .",
    "this means that the mass loss rate can be found once the coefficient @xmath165 is known .",
    "moreover , @xmath125 is solely determined by the background vertical field strength and does not depend on the disk thickness or the disk surface density . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath166 deviates from @xmath172 , then one would expect @xmath173 .    in sum ,",
    "although @xmath125 is not well determined from shearing - box simulations , we argue that by carefully studying the dependence of @xmath125 on the height of the simulation box , it is possible to obtain a physical estimate of the mass loss rate .      while we have demonstrated the correlation @xmath167 , we have not discussed the range that it is applicable . reading from table [ fig : amt ] , we see that @xmath125 for @xmath6 is somewhat smaller than the expected linear correlation , which is suggestive of saturation .",
    "indeed , the rate of mass outflow measured in @xcite for a similar numerical setup ( their run 1dz6 ) with @xmath17 gives @xmath174 ( multiplied by 2 to account for two surfaces ) , which is only a factor of 2.5 times higher than our case with @xmath6 ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "with further stronger magnetic field that is too strong for the mri to operate , @xcite showed that the rate of mass outflow should rapidly decrease once @xmath0 drops below @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , the scaling relation @xmath167 holds up to @xmath176 , beyond which the mass loss rate slows down and will eventually fall off rapidly for strong super - equipartition field field .",
    "these results , all together , suggest an evolutionary scenario . assuming no magnetic flux evolution ,",
    "the disk would lose mass at constant rate ( assuming @xmath177 ) until the midplane net vertical field exceeds equipartition .",
    "@xcite explored such a scenario in their 1d simulations and confirmed the steady decrease of mass loss rate with increasing magnetization in the strong field regime .",
    "a strongly magnetized thin accretion disk may gradually evolve into such a stage , where the rate of mass loss is self - regulated so that it loses mass faster as more mass is fed into the disk ( increasing @xmath0 , but still @xmath178 ) , while loses mass slower if the mass loss is not compensated ( decreasing @xmath0 ) .",
    "the disk structure would be similar to a jet - emitting disk @xcite , which is tenuous with super equipartition field .",
    "alternatively , if the evolution starts from a strongly magnetized thick disk , the mass loss rate can be so large that the disk will be depleted in a few orbits .",
    "for example , without feeding mass to our run b2 , the mass loss time scale is only about 5 orbits .",
    "such rapid mass loss may lead to catastrophic disruption of the disk , such as in core - collapse supernovae where rapidly rotating progenitor core is threaded by extremely strong magnetic fields @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss whether the outflow launched from shearing - box mri simulations can be connected to a global blandford - payne type disk wind .",
    "the key to this question lies in the symmetry .",
    "we note that due to the neglect of curvature , shearing - box approximation does not specify which side of the radial domain the central object is located . for a physical disk wind",
    ", symmetry requires that the outflow from the top and bottom sides of the disk should be inclined towards the same radial and azimuthal directions ( which would be considered as radially outward and trailing ) , and remains so at all times . since gas flows along magnetic field lines , the mean magnetic field at the top and bottom sides of the disk should be bent to the same direction .",
    "the first difficulty for outflow - wind connection is the magnetic dynamo , applicable to the cases with @xmath9 as we discussed in secion [ ssec : dynamo ] .",
    "the constant flipping of the mean azimuthal ( as well as radial , see figure [ fig : dynamo_bx ] ) field lines means that the direction of the outflow would constantly swap between radially inward and outward , either of the directions would be invalid for a global disk wind .",
    "although our simulations with @xmath16 are in many aspects very similar to simulations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , they argue that such phenomenon leads to the time variability of the wind .",
    "however , we stress here that the simple fact of cyclic sign change of the large - scale field is already inconsistent with global wind geometry .    .",
    "all in code units.,width=340 ]    the second difficulty is that even there were no dynamo , such as the case for @xmath65 , the natural symmetry from the simulation is unphysical for it to be connected to a global disk wind . in figure",
    "[ fig : bt100prof ] , we show the vertical profiles of the magnetic field and velocity fields for run b2 .",
    "clearly , the outflows at the top and bottom sides of the disk are inclined toward opposite directions , which is inconsistent with a global disk wind . even in the presence of the dynamo",
    ", there is a good chance that field lines at the top and bottom sides tend to incline toward different directions ( as can be tracked in figures [ fig : dynamo ] and [ fig : dynamo_bx ] ) .",
    "symmetry is also directly related to the vertical angular momentum transport by the outflow , as we discussed in section [ ssec : amt ] . with the wrong symmetry , the wind stress ( [ eq : windt ] ) at the top and bottom sides of the disk",
    "have the same sign , and cancel each other , hence the net vertical angular momentum transport vanishes .",
    "one might attribute this ",
    "wrong - symmetry \" problem to the one extra degree of freedom in shearing - box simulations , which could possibly be avoided by performing global simulations .",
    "while it is certainly important to explore the same problem in global geometry , it has been suggested by @xcite that global effects can be effectively taken into account by applying some additional constraints on the vertical boundaries .",
    "ogilvie constructed a 1d model for launching disk wind / jet in the shearing - box approximation , where a much stronger net vertical field @xmath179 was assumed so as to suppress the mri .",
    "he assigned the two free parameters at the vertical boundaries to be the strength of the radial and azimuthal magnetic fields ( he has two parameters because the alfvn point turns out to be beyond his computational domain ) , and was able to successfully construct laminar wind solutions with the desired symmetry for the given constraints .    in view of this possibility , we further modify our vertical boundary conditions so that the mean radial ( or azimuthal ) magnetic field in the last four grid zones at the vertical boundary are set to some fixed value , which is done by first calculating the mean radial ( or azimuthal ) field in these zones , and then subtracting a constant radial ( or azimuthal ) field uniformly in all these cells to make the mean field equal to the desired value without violating the divergence - free condition . as we see in figure",
    "[ fig : bt100prof ] , the mean radial field at vertical boundaries is roughly the same as the mean vertical field in strength .",
    "therefore , we demand that the field incline by @xmath150 at vertical boundaries in the @xmath180 plane , and require that the mean radial fields at the two vertical boundaries have opposite signs which conforms to the desired symmetry .",
    "however , after performing various experiments on smaller domain test runs with parameters similar to runs b2 , b3 and b4 , we find that such a treatment does not have an evident physical effect on the profile of the mean flow and mean field , except for introducing a strong current sheet at the vertical boundaries .",
    "this fact has also been discussed in @xcite , and we conclude that the poloidal field inclination at disk surface , particularly the symmetry of the mean horizontal fields , is insensitive to the imposed vertical boundary condition the once the alfvn point is contained within the simulation domain . in sum , we conclude that whether or not the mri turbulence is accompanied by dynamo activities , the outflow from the shearing - box mri simulations is unlikely to be _ directly _ connected to a global disk wind .",
    "the fate of the outflow remains to be explored using global simulations .",
    "in this paper , we have successfully performed local stratified shearing - box simulations of the mri that include a strong vertical magnetic flux with midplane plasma @xmath181 of the net vertical field ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath152 , a regime that has not been explored while is very likely relevant to accretion disks in many astrophysical systems .",
    "such a magnetic configuration gives rise to very vigorous mri turbulence , and simultaneously launches an outflow .",
    "we studied the properties of the mri turbulence as well as the disk outflow in detail and our major findings are summarized below .      * with relatively weak net vertical field of @xmath9 ,",
    "the disk consists of a gas pressure dominated disk midplane and a magnetic dominated disk corona ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "by contrast , the entire disk becomes magnetically dominated when @xmath10 .",
    "the strong magnetic support substantially modifies the vertical structure of the disk and makes it substantially thicker . *",
    "turbulent magnetic and kinetic energies increase monotonically with net vertical magnetic flux , and saturate when @xmath10 .",
    "the mri also generates large scale toroidal magnetic field whose strength increases monotonically with net vertical field , and dominates the total magnetic energy over contribution from turbulence for @xmath183 . *",
    "the shakura - sunyaev parameter @xmath7 increases monotonically with net vertical magnetic flux , ranging from @xmath3 at @xmath16 to @xmath5 for @xmath184 .",
    "maxwell stress dominates reynolds stress by a factor of 4 - 7 . for weak net vertical flux of @xmath9 , turbulent fluctuations dominates the contribution to @xmath7 , while for @xmath10 , radial transport of angular momentum is dominated by the large scale fields . *",
    "the mri dynamo that generates cyclic flips of the mean toroidal field persists in the presence of weak net vertical magnetic flux , but becomes more sporadic with less periodicity as net flux increases .",
    "the dynamo is completely suppressed when the net flux is strong with @xmath185 , where the mean toroidal field exceeds equipartition strength and never flips .",
    "our results demonstrate the crucial dependence of the behavior of the mri turbulence on the net vertical magnetic flux . in particular",
    ", there is a critical net vertical magnetic flux of @xmath186 near which many aspects of the mri turbulence change qualitatively . additionally , more careful convergence study is still needed , and deeper understanding about the properties with mri turbulence would further benefit from the study of prantl number dependence @xcite .      * the slow magnetosonic point and the alfvn point are always contained in our simulation box . the location of these critical points shifts towards the disk midplane as net vertical magnetic flux increases .",
    "the launching and acceleration of the outflow are due to the magnetocentrifugal mechanism , where surface magnetic field is sufficiently inclined .",
    "* there is a robust trend that the outflow mass loss rate @xmath125 increases with increasing net vertical field , and tends saturate at @xmath11 .",
    "although @xmath125 can not be well determined from shearing - box simulations , its exact value in real systems is likely to be much smaller than the measured from local simulations and may depend on the aspect ratio @xmath187 . *",
    "the outflow from the mri simulations is unlikely to be _ directly _ connected to a global disk wind for geometric reasons . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the large scale radial and azimuthal field lines are constantly flipped due to the dynamo activities without a permanent bending direction . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the large scale magnetic fields do not change sign across the midplane , hence the field lines at the two sides of the disk bend to opposite directions , inconsistent with a global wind geometry . *",
    "angular momentum transport by the disk outflow is likely to play a minor role compared with that by the mri turbulence for relatively weak net vertical magnetic flux . with stronger net vertical flux ( @xmath10 ) , the symmetry of the flow ( as the dynamo is suppressed ) makes net vertical angular momentum transport be zero , but gives oppositely directed inflow / outflow with substantial mass flux .",
    "it has been reported that @xmath125 from shearing - box mri simulations decreases with increasing height of the simulation domain , which is related to the intrinsic limitations of the shearing - box framework .",
    "we propose that a careful study of the height dependence can help determining the true value of @xmath125 in real systems .",
    "our results leave an open question on the fate of the outflow , which can only be reliably explored using global simulations and will be discussed further in section [ ssec : winddiscussion ] .",
    "we note that shearing - box simulations with zero net vertical flux tend to give @xmath188 with confirmed numerical convergence @xcite .",
    "the vast dominance of simulations of this type has , to some extent , implicitly created a misconception that the @xmath7 value resulting from the mri turbulence if of the order @xmath14 . on the observational side , the value of @xmath7 can be estimated from the viscous timescale of transient systems such as dwarf novae , x - ray transient and fu ori bursts , where it was found to be of the order @xmath189 or larger @xcite .",
    "such apparent discrepancy leads @xcite to question about the efficiency of the mri in driving disk accretion and evolution .",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 on net vertical magnetic flux has already been extensively discussed in unstratified shearing - box simulations @xcite .",
    "our simulations further confirm and quantify this trend using more realistic simulations with vertical stratification , and demonstrate that the above discrepancy can be naturally resolved if accretion disks are threaded by some large scale poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath0 immediately indicates that the evolution of accretion disks strongly depends on the distribution of poloidal magnetic flux through the disk . on the other hand , because of flux freezing in ideal mhd , the distribution of magnetic flux is intimately connected to disk evolution ( as well as turbulent diffusion and reconnection due to the mri ) .",
    "therefore , the mutual dependence of disk evolution and magnetic flux evolution makes the problem of disk accretion intrinsically non - local , hence a full understanding of accretion disk structure and evolution requires global simulations .",
    "most global simulations to date adopt a magnetic field geometry that is analogous to zero net - flux shearing - box : the simulations are initialized either with single / multiple poloidal magnetic loops for a thick disk torus @xcite , or with pure toroidal magnetic field in a thin power - law disk @xcite .",
    "these simulations generally show values of @xmath7 that are slightly higher than @xmath14 ( @xmath190 ) . in these simulations ,",
    "the mri generates net vertical magnetic flux in the local patches of the disk connected by coronal loops and the local stress correlates with the net vertical flux @xcite . combined with our study , the local net vertical flux in these global simulations is sufficient to account for the slightly higher total stress @xmath7 than that in zero net flux shearing - box simulations .",
    "however , the distribution of local net vertical magnetic flux falls off quickly with stronger net flux , hence the total value of @xmath7 can not be enhanced substantially .",
    "initial magnetic field geometry plays an important role in global simulations of the mri , although the situation with large scale poloidal fields threading the disk have rarely been explored .",
    "semi - analytical treatment reveals that the global distribution of large - scale magnetic flux in accretion disks depends largely on the ratio of turbulent viscosity and resistivity @xcite , as well as the vertical structure of the disk @xcite . together with these works ,",
    "our simulations provide strong motivation for exploring the consequence of large scale poloidal field in global simulations .",
    "such simulations will not only expand our knowledge the mri , but will also address the fate of the outflow , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "it has been recognized that strong net vertical field that approaches equipartition strength at the disk midplane is necessary for launching a steady - state wind @xcite .",
    "the requirement may be relaxed to lower magnetizations @xcite , while for magnetization that is too low the outflow is either suppressed or highly unsteady @xcite .",
    "numerous global simulations have studied launching of disk wind in the context of protostellar disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) ) . however , as noted in section [ sec : intro ] , the use of artificial diffusion in these simulations do not properly reflect the disk microphysics . for strong net vertical field that would suppress the mri",
    ", the artificial diffusion has unknown origin ( and the non - ideal mhd effects can not be properly treated as artificial diffusion , @xcite ) . for weaker net vertical field ,",
    "the mri is the presumed source of artificial diffusion .",
    "however , our evidence against direct wind launching all originate from the microphysical effects of the mri ( such as the mri dynamo ) that can not be captured in these simulations .",
    "another family of global simulations focus on non - radiative accretion disks around black holes ( bh ) .",
    "these simulations either use psudo - newtonian gravitational potential for the bh or adopt a general - relativistic prescription . despite the non - keplerian nature in the vicinity of the bhs , the physics of the mri that is not too close to the innermost stable orbit is similar . most of these simulations adopt similar poloidal loop field geometry and focus on jet launching which deals with the innermost part of the accretion flow , a few of them do have included large scale poloidal fields .",
    "in particular , @xcite initialized the simulations with pure vertical magnetic fields with @xmath191 . however , upon saturation",
    "the launching of a blandford - payne type wind was not observed , which was attributed to a global  coronal mechanism \" that governs the magnetic flux evolution .",
    "also , their simulations have relatively small radial domain and very thick disk .",
    "significant outflow has been reported in two - dimensional mhd simulations @xcite , where mri is a transient phenomenon .",
    "more recently , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite studied the accretion flow with large scale initial poloidal field in the inner disk with @xmath191 which leads to a ",
    "magnetically arrested \" or  magnetically chocked \" accretion flow due to the accumulation of magnetic flux in the vicinity of the bh .",
    "the mri in the main disk was properly resolved in these simulations , however , they do not report any significant disk outflow in the inner region of the disks , and found that the jet power is directly correlated with bh spin .",
    "together , it appears that blandford - payne type disk wind has not been unambiguously identified in global simulations with properly resolved mri turbulence .",
    "future studies should focus on the largely unexplored area of 3d global simulations for thin accretion disks in the presence of large - scale poloidal magnetic field .",
    "large simulation domain in both radius and polar angle , fine resolution in the disk , and careful treatment of boundary conditions are required ( t. suzuki , private communication ) , and such simulations are essential to ascertain the nature of the outflow , and to reveal the underlying physics governing the evolution of accretion disks .",
