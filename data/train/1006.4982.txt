    "although the formation of stable clusters of particles that interact via entirely repulsive , ultrasoft potentials might seem counterintuitive at first sight , it is by now well established that cluster phases of such systems _ do _ exist  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is potentially relevant for a wide class of ultrasoft colloidal systems , such as dendrimers and microgels , in which the centers of mass of the colloidal particles can overlap with a finite energy cost .",
    "theoretical considerations  @xcite in combination with computer simulations  @xcite for models of ultrasoft colloidal particles have given evidence for the existence of these clusters and have , in addition , provided a deeper understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "stable clusters form either in disordered , liquid - like phases or occur as ordered cluster crystals where the particle aggregates populate the lattice sites of regular fcc or bcc lattices .",
    "most of the investigations have been dedicated up to now to study the static properties of the cluster phases , of which we mention the two most remarkable ones : ( i ) freezing and melting lines depend in a linear way on the density and ( ii ) the lattice constant of cluster crystals is invariant under compression , inducing thereby a linear growth of the cluster size with density .",
    "in contrast , little effort has been dedicated , so far , to obtain a deeper insight into the dynamics that governs these cluster forming systems . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only two contributions that deal with the diffusion and the relaxation dynamics in cluster crystals have been published  @xcite . from these investigations , based on molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , it became clear that the dynamics in cluster crystals shows features at least as intriguing as their static counterparts .",
    "for instance , these investigations revealed that particles move constantly between neighboring clusters , while maintaining the original lattice structure of the cluster crystal and the average cluster population on the lattice sites .",
    "further , a closer analysis of the dynamic correlation functions provided evidence for a decoupling between self and collective time - dependent correlations  @xcite .",
    "the present contribution is dedicated to investigate the dynamical properties of ultrasoft particles in a crystalline cluster phase in detail and from a more general point of view . in particular , we intend to study how mass transport is realized in different simulation schemes , which mimic different scenarios in related realistic systems : ( i ) in md simulations , where the influence of the microscopic solvent is neglected and the mesoscopic ( colloidal ) particles move according to newton s law ; ( ii ) in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , where the random collisions of the colloids with the solvent particles are mimicked through the stochastic nature of the algorithm ; ( iii ) in brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations , where the influence of the solvent is taken into account via the friction term and the stochastic forces acting on the particles .    the model system that we choose to study cluster phases is the generalized exponential model of index @xmath2 ( gem-@xmath2 )  @xcite , in which particles interact via the potential @xmath3 \\,.\\ ] ] in the literature , this model has been used to describe the effective interactions between linear polymer chains ( @xmath4 )  @xcite and dendrimers ( @xmath5 )  @xcite in the dilute regime . for @xmath6",

    "we have found distinct differences between these two types of dynamics imposed by the simulation technique : in mc simulations , hopping takes place only over short distances ( i.e. , essentially from one cluster to a neighboring one ) ; in contrast , in md simulations particles can migrate over large distances through the crystal .",
    "furthermore , our investigations on the diffusion constant and on the dynamic correlation functions have shown that properties calculated from md and mc _ can not _ be superposed by a simple , temperature - independent rescaling of time .",
    "this finding is in striking contrast to what is known from normal  @xcite or glass - forming  @xcite liquids .",
    "finally , we have found that bd simulations give rise to dynamical properties very similar to those observed in mc simulations , supporting the view that mc dynamics effectively ( although approximately ) incorporates solvent effects  @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that a complex dynamical scenario may arise as a competition of activated processes and momentum correlations , and suggest that the solvent properties may change qualitatively the nature of the slow dynamics in cluster - forming colloidal systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the model and present our simulation methods ; in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results for the dynamical properties of a gem-4 cluster crystal and finally in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we give our conclusions . in the appendix we present our algorithm for cluster identification .",

    "we remark that an attempt to rescale the time unit in our mc simulations by the acceptance ratio , as suggested in  @xcite , resulted in slightly poorer agreement between the two datasets of @xmath144 .",

    "the envelope of the jump length distribution is within a good approximation an exponentially decaying function of the distance and extends up to and beyond ten nearest neighbor distances . at large distances ,",
    "the jump length distribution is described rather well by a power law , @xmath65 , with @xmath146 . in mc simulations , by contrast , hopping events are limited to the nearest clusters , as a result of the purely configurational nature of the dynamics .",
    "( ii ) the diffusion constant , @xmath90 , evaluated in md and mc simulations can not be matched on a single master curve by a simple rescaling of the respective time units .",
    "this finding is in striking contrast to related results obtained in investigations on equilibrated  @xcite and supercooled  @xcite liquids .",
    "however , by normalizing @xmath90 with respect to the underlying jump length distribution , an activation energy can be filtered out that is common to both types of dynamics .",
    "( iii ) also for the dynamic correlation functions we find distinct differences , which become apparent in the overall shape of the self part of the van hove correlation function , in the non - gaussian parameter , and in the long time decay of the self intermediate scattering function for off - lattice wave vectors .",
    "( iv ) bd simulations give rise to dynamical properties very similar to those observed during mc simulations , supporting the view that solvent effects are implicitly and effectively included in mc simulations through the stochastic nature of the algorithm .    the present contribution  along with refs .",
    "@xcite  can only be considered as a first step towards a deeper understanding of the evidently complex dynamics of cluster forming , ultrasoft systems .",
    "quite a few issues remain unaddressed , which will be dealt with in future contributions .",
    "first , a more systematic study of the influence of the solvent , using full langevin dynamics and possibly including hydrodynamic interactions , is required and will be performed in future work .",
    "other simulation methods , such as dissipative particle dynamics  @xcite , might provide a different , complementary view on our data .",
    "another aspect is related to the underlying model : our inter - particle potential represents an effective interaction between two mesoscopic ( colloidal ) particles , where the degrees of freedom of the microscopic constituents of the colloids have been traced out  @xcite .",
    "an important issue is thus related to the _ level _ of coarse - graining , ranging from the present picture of an `` effective '' particle  @xcite , over partially averaging over sub - entities , such as in multi - blob representations  @xcite , or force - matching schemes  @xcite , to the fully atomistic level where all the constituent entities of the colloidal particles and the particles of the solvent are considered explicitly .",
    "another fundamental question addressing the interpretation of the dynamic correlation functions is how the dynamics of a system of `` effective '' particles is related to that of a system of atomistically resolved particles .    in conclusion",
    ", our work has revealed qualitative differences in the dynamics of ultrasoft , cluster - forming particles obtained using newtonian and two stochastic ( i.e. , brownian dynamics and monte carlo ) simulation methods .",
    "this effect has been attributed to the competition between activated processes and solvent effects , which controls the distribution of jump lengths and ultimately the dynamic correlation functions .",
    "we speculate that the interplay between activated slow dynamics and solvent effects could generate complex dynamical scenarios in ultrasoft colloids , such as dendrimers and microgels , and even a broader class of cluster - forming colloids , including systems with competing interactions . with this contribution",
