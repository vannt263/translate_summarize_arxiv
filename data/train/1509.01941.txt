    "the observability of the galactic center in the near - infrared and its relative proximity at a distance of @xmath3 allow the study of a galactic nucleus in unparalleled detail ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "adaptive optics assisted imaging observations of the galactic center with naco at the vlt or nirc2 at the keck observatory routinely achieve a resolution close to the diffraction limit and a depth limited by source confusion . since the discovery of stars with large proper motions @xcite , the continued monitoring of individual stellar orbits has produced strong evidence for a compact mass of @xmath4 that can be convincingly attributed to a quiescent massive black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the location of the radio source sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "increasing the astrometric precision would permit measuring orbits of more stars than presently possible , permit refined estimates of the black hole s mass and distance , and eventually permit the detection of relativistic effects on the orbits of short - period stars , most immediately post - newtonian effects on the orbit of the star s2 .",
    "while the motions of the so - called s - stars in the central @xmath5 are measured from images taken with the s13 camera of naco ( @xmath6 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , less frequent observations with the s27 camera ( @xmath7 ) are used to efficiently set up the astrometric reference frame . however , the s27 camera is affected by optical image distortion on a non - negligible level , as for example is the narrow field camera of nirc2 @xcite . by systematically altering the relative positions of stars on the detector ,",
    "this effect becomes a substantial source of uncertainty when positions measured on widely dithered images are combined into a common coordinate system or when they are aligned with astrometric reference sources .",
    "in our earlier studies of stellar orbits at the galactic center @xcite we used high - order coordinate transformations to mitigate the effect of image distortion and relied primarily on a reference frame based on the assumption that a sufficiently large number of evolved stars in the nuclear cluster show no net motion .",
    "the stellar motions in this ` cluster rest frame ' were then placed in an astrometric coordinate system centred on sgr  a * by aligning the positions of several sio maser stars at a certain epoch with their positions as predicted from radio observations .",
    "the comparison of the s - stars positions over several years was still limited by a systematic uncertainty of @xmath8 associated with the definition of the coordinate system , likely because of residual distortion in the s27 camera . yet",
    "the typical uncertainty of a single position is as low as @xmath9 , limited by residual distortion in the s13 camera , uncertainty in modelling the point spread function ( psf ) and ultimately source confusion @xcite .",
    "the long - term stability of the cluster rest frame is also fundamentally limited to @xmath10 by the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the selected stars in the plane of the sky ( @xmath11 ; ) and the number of available stars ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we construct an alternative astrometric reference frame , which has now become more advantageous , by relating many well - measured stars to the sio maser stars directly at multiple epochs and then using their motion with respect to sgr  a * for reference .",
    "the details on the construction of this ` sgr  a * rest frame ' @xcite are described in section  [ sec : astrometry ] and the precision of localizing ( radio-)sgr  a * in the infrared frame has important implications for the analysis of stellar orbits ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) . to improve this precision",
    "we have implemented a more accurate distortion correction for the s27 camera of naco . in section  [ sec : distortion_correction ] the apparent distortion is measured at four epochs between 2004 and 2012 from images of globular clusters in the eso archive .",
    "this is possible by matching them to hubble space telescope  ( hst ) astrometry , which can be considered distortion - free in comparison .",
    "based on the resulting distortion models it is then possible to also correct other images taken close in time .",
    "a per night self - calibration approach is not feasible for our galactic center observations , because the requirement that many of the same stars are placed in many different regions on the detector is not met .",
    "to start with , we describe our data and basic data processing in section  [ sec : image_processing ] ."

    "<S> near - infrared observations of stellar orbits at the galactic center provide conclusive evidence for a massive black hole associated with the compact radio source sgr a*. the astrometric reference frame for these observations is tied to a set of red giant stars , which are also detectable at radio wavelengths through sio maser emission in their envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> we have improved the precision and long - term stability of this reference frame , in which sgr a * is localized to within a factor @xmath0 better than previously : @xmath1 in position ( in 2009 ) and @xmath2 in velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is the result of modeling and correcting optical distortion in the vlt / naco imager to a sub - mas level and including new infrared and radio measurements , which now both span more than a decade in time . </S>",
