    "we denote the set of angles between pairs of closed geodesics on @xmath0 by @xmath3 .",

    "the main question that we address in this paper is the following .",
    "[ multi ] how many angles in @xmath3 can be a rational multiple of @xmath2 ?",
    "surprisingly the author s motivation to study this question came from a seemingly unrelated field . in the paper @xcite",
    "we have studied eigenfunctions of the laplacian on hyperbolic surfaces .",

    "the answer to question [ multi ] is ` infinite ' . in the last section",
    "we construct examples of surfaces for which there are infinitely many distinct intersections between pairs of closed geodesics such that the angle of intersection is @xmath25 .",

    "using the fact that @xmath26 is finitely generated it follows that @xmath32 is a finitely generated field extension of @xmath33 . using the expression for @xmath11",

    "now consider the euclidean triangle on @xmath14 with the following three vertices : the centre of the ( semi - circle ) axis of @xmath29 , the centre of the ( semi - circle ) axis of @xmath30 and @xmath65 the point of intersection of the two axes .",
    "let us denote the distance between the two centres by @xmath69 .",
