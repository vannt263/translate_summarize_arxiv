    "since the discovery of charmonium , it has been clear that the properties of the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) states are key elements in the understanding of the role and limitations of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) in this energy regime .",
    "the existence of a triplet of p states , split by spin - orbit and tensor force terms , allows us to probe the spin structure of qcd forces .",
    "the production and decay mechanisms of the @xmath10 states are still actively being studied at low energy @xmath11 storage rings , at high energy colliders and in fixed target experiments@xcite .",
    "the most precise determinations of mass and width come , however , from our study of charmonium spectroscopy by formation of @xmath12 states in @xmath13 annihilation at the fermilab antiproton source ( experiments e760 and e835 ) .",
    "the e760 collaboration measured the resonance parameters of the @xmath3 and @xmath4@xcite and more recently we reported measurements of the @xmath14 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the results of new measurements of the @xmath3 parameters made , with greatly improved statistics , by e835 .",
    "the @xmath4 parameters were also remeasured with statistics comparable to those of experiment e760 .",
    "our e760 results have been updated to account for revised values of reference parameters and are quoted below .",
    "we briefly review the technique used in this experiment .",
    "a localized source ( 0.5@xmath150.5@xmath150.6 @xmath16 ) of @xmath13 interactions at instantaneous luminosities up to @xmath17@xmath18s@xmath19 was obtained by intersecting the beam of stochastically cooled antiprotons circulating in the accumulator , with a jet of clusterized hydrogen molecules ( @xmath20atoms@xmath21@xmath22 . the momentum of the antiproton beam was changed in small steps allowing a fine scan of narrow resonances .",
    "the parameters of a @xmath23 resonance ( r ) , mass , width and @xmath24 , were then determined from the excitation curve obtained by measuring the cross section at each value of the antiproton - proton center - of - mass energy ( @xmath25 ) . with this technique ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the mass and width measurements are greatly reduced since they depend only on the knowledge of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "we determine the center - of - mass energy distribution by measuring the beam - revolution - frequency spectrum and the orbit length , as described in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "we calibrate the central orbit length @xmath26 using the recent high - precision measurement of the @xmath27 mass by the kedr experiment , @xmath28 mev / c@xmath29 @xcite , which gives an uncertainty of @xmath30 mm out of 474.046 m. @xmath31 , the correction to @xmath26 due to deviations from the central orbit , is determined using 48 horizontal beam - position monitors ( bpms ) @xcite @xcite . for scan i at the @xmath3 , the uncertainty in @xmath31 was estimated as 1 mm ( rms ) [ 110 kev ] @xcite .",
    "the bpm system was subsequently improved and we estimate the uncertainty for the subsequent scans as 0.64 mm ( rms ) [ 70 kev at the @xmath3 , 75 kev at the @xmath4 ] .",
    "the center - of - mass energy spread , @xmath33 , was approximately 200 kev at the @xmath34 formation energies .",
    "the cross section for formation of the @xmath34 states is less than 10@xmath35 of the inelastic @xmath13 hadronic cross section .",
    "even so , a clean signal was extracted by selecting electromagnetic final states as tags of charmonium formation .",
    "the @xmath10 were studied in the inclusive reaction :    @xmath36    the non - magnetic spectrometer ( fig.[fig : det ] ) was optimized for the detection of photons and electrons , and is described in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "the apparatus had full acceptance in azimuth ( @xmath37 ) , with a cylindrical central system and a planar forward system .",
    "the detector elements used for the trigger and for the offline selection of events from reaction ( 1 ) were ( a ) three hodoscopes , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , azimuthally segmented in 8 , 24 and 32 counters respectively , ( b ) a threshold gas erenkov counter for identifying @xmath41 , divided in two volumes in polar angle ; each volume was segmented azimuthally in 8 sectors aligned with the counters of the @xmath38 hodoscope , and ( c ) two lead - glass calorimeters for measuring the energy and direction of photons and electrons : a cylindrical one ( ccal ) with 1280 counters , covering the polar angles @xmath42 and a planar one ( fcal ) covering the polar angles @xmath43 .",
    "all counters were equipped with time and pulse - height measurement capability .",
    "the luminosity was measured at each data point with a statistical precision of @xmath44 and systematic uncertainty of @xmath45 , by counting recoil protons from elastic @xmath13 scattering in three solid state detectors located at @xmath46 to the beam direction .",
    "the hardware trigger was designed to select events with a @xmath47 decay in the central detector @xcite .",
    "it required two charged tracks , each defined by a coincidence between two hodoscope counters ( @xmath48 ) aligned in azimuth , with at least one of the two particles tagged as an electron by a signal in the corresponding erenkov cell .",
    "in addition , two large energy deposits ( clusters ) separated by more than 90@xmath49 in azimuth and with an invariant mass greater than 60@xmath50 of the center of mass energy , were required in the ccal .",
    "the efficiency of this trigger was measured to be @xmath51 from a clean sample of @xmath52 events , taken with relaxed trigger conditions .",
    "online , a filtering program certified as electron candidates ccal energy clusters aligned with tracks formed by the hodoscopes and erenkov elements .",
    "the data presented here were collected by experiment e835 , in three scans performed at the @xmath53 in august 1997 ( scan i ) , february 2000 ( scan ii ) , and july 2000 ( scan iii ) , and one scan performed at the @xmath54 in february 2000 . the center of mass energy , @xmath55 , width of the @xmath25 distribution , @xmath56 , and integrated luminosity , @xmath57 , for each @xmath58",
    "are given in table [ tab : dati2 ] .",
    "our data analysis methods are described in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "the offline selection of @xmath3 and @xmath4 events compatible with reaction ( 1 ) is done in three steps ; the first two are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mee ] which shows , at each step , the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath59 candidates for on - resonance data and ( shaded ) for data taken off - resonance , normalized to the integrated luminosity of the data taken in the resonance region . in the first step ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mee]a ) , all events with two electron ( i.e. electron - positron ) candidates within the erenkov fiducial region ( @xmath60 ) and an invariant mass ( @xmath61 ) above 2600 mev / c@xmath29 are selected . a clear enhancement is seen in the on - resonance data at the mass of the @xmath62 . in the next step ,",
    "the electron candidates are identified by using an  electron weight \" parameter , which is a likelihood ratio for the electron hypothesis versus the background hypothesis .",
    "it uses the pulse heights in the three hodoscopes ( @xmath38,@xmath39,@xmath40 ) and erenkov counter , and the transverse energy distribution of the ccal clusters , and distinguishes single electron tracks from background ( predominantly @xmath11 pairs from photon conversions in the 0.18 mm thick steel beam - pipe and @xmath63 decays ) . the resulting @xmath11 invariant mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mee]b . the slight enhancement in the background level at the @xmath62 mass peak comes from the continuum of @xmath64 events ."
