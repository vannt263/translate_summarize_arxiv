    "dark energy has become one of the most important issues of the modern cosmology ever since the observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) first indicated that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion at the present stage @xcite .",
    "however , hitherto , we still know little about dark energy .",
    "dark energy is almost equally distributes in the universe , and its pressure is negative .",
    "the simplest and most theoretically appealing candidate of dark energy is vacuum energy ( or a cosmological constant @xmath0 ) with a constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this scenario is in general agreement with the current astronomical observations , but has difficulties to reconcile the small observational value of dark energy density with estimates from quantum field theories ; this is the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that @xmath0cdm model may also suffer an age problem @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to pursue alternative possibilities to explain the mystery of dark energy . over the past decade",
    "numerous dark energy models have been proposed , such as quintessence , phantom , k - essence , tachyon , ( generalized ) chaplygin gas , dgp , etc .",
    "k - essence , a simple approach toward constructing a model for an accelerated expansion of the universe , is to work with the idea that the unknown dark energy component is due exclusively to a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath2 with non - canonical kinetic energy which results in the negative pressure @xcite .",
    "the k - essence scenario has received much attention , it was originally proposed as a model for inflation @xcite , and then as a model for dark energy @xcite .",
    "its action has the form @xmath3.\\ ] ] this general field lagrangian includes as particular cases the common canonical scalar field model , dbi - inflaton @xcite and k - inflation / k - essence @xcite .",
    "in several cases , k - essence can not be observationally distinguished from quintessence @xcite .",
    "a method to obtain a phantom version of frw k - essence cosmologies was devised in [ 6 ] .",
    "the stability of k - essence was studied in @xcite .",
    "dynamics of k - essence were discussed in @xcite .",
    "conditions for stable tracker solutions for k - essence in a general cosmological background were derived in @xcite .",
    "slow - roll conditions for thawing k - essence were obtained in @xcite . a connection between the holographic dark energy density and the kinetic k - essence energy density was discussed in @xcite .",
    "an holographic k - essence model of dark energy was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the geometrical diagnostic for purely kinetic k - essence dark energy was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of a barotropic perfect fluid with a k - essence scalar field was considered in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "dark matter to dark energy transition in k - essence cosmologies was examined in @xcite .",
    "models of dark energy with purely kinetic multiple k - essence sources that allow for the crossing of the phantom divide line were investigated in @xcite- @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of k - essence was discussed in @xcite .",
    "models of k - essence unified dark matter were discussed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "power - law expansion in k - essence cosmology was investigated in @xcite .",
    "theoretical and observational constraints on k - essence dark energy models were discussed in @xcite-@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a model independent method of reconstructing the lagrangian for the k - essence field by using three parametrizations for the hubble parameter @xmath4 was studied in detail . with assumptions on the eos of k - essence as functions of the scale factor ,",
    "@xcite discussed the forms of the lagrangians . by assuming the eos of k - essence as functions of the kinetic energy , ref .",
    "@xcite consider restrictions on purely kinetic k - essence .",
    "some properties of k - essence have been studied in @xcite-@xcite .    since from it was proposed , k - essence was been studied intensively .",
    "it is still worth investigating in a systematic way the possible cosmological behavior of the k - essence cosmology .",
    "thus , in the present work we reconstruct some of k - essence models .",
    "we are interested in investigating the possible late - time solutions . in these solutions",
    "we calculate various observable quantities , such as the density of the dark energy and the equation of state parameters .",
    "as we see , k - essence cosmology can be consistent with observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we briefly review the model of k - essence . in sec.iii , we study the @xmath5-models of k - essence and in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate their cosmological behaviors .",
    "finally , the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "note that in this paper , we have used the metric signature @xmath6 and natural units with @xmath7 .",
    "let us start from the following action of pure kinetic k - essence [ 4 , 5 , 33 ] @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the matter lagrangian density . here",
    "@xmath10 is the k - essence lagrangian , which depends on the dimensionless quantity @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 a possible motivation for actions of this form comes from considering low - energy effective string theory in the presence of a high - order derivative terms @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such theories have been exploited as models for inflation and dark matter / energy , for example a purely kinetic k - essence or ghost condensate .",
    "the simplest nontrivial example of purely kinetic k - essence is a ghost condensate lagrangian @xmath13 which has been also studied in the context of dark matter / energy unification .",
    "another example originates from the dirac - born - infeld description of a @xmath14-brane in string theory with the scalar born - infeld type lagrangian @xmath15    the energy momentum tensor obtained from ( 2.1 ) takes the perfect fluid form , @xmath16 here @xmath17 where @xmath18 is @xmath19 or @xmath20 according to whether @xmath21 is positive or negative , i.e. , the sign of of @xmath22 is chosen so @xmath23 is positive .",
    "the associated hydrodynamic quantities are @xmath24 so that the equation of state parameter , @xmath25 , is @xmath26 here @xmath27 are the pressure of the scalar field @xmath2 and its energy density , respectively .",
    "we also introduce the sound speed of k - essence , which is the relevant quantity for the growth of density perturbations , @xmath28 let us rewrite eq.(2.9 ) as @xmath29 the definition of the sound speed comes from the equation describing the evoluion of linear adiabatic perturbations in a k - essence dominated universe @xcite ( the non - adiabatic perturbation was discussed in @xcite-@xcite , here we only consider the case of adiabatic perturbations ) .",
    "perturbations can become unstable if the sound speed is imaginary , @xmath30 , so we insist on @xmath31 .",
    "another potentially interesting requirement to consider is @xmath32 , which says that the sound speed should not exceed the speed of light , which suggests violation of causality .",
    "note , however , this is still an open problem ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "we now consider the spatially flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time with a time - dependent scale factor @xmath33 and a metric @xmath34 where @xmath35 is cosmic time . for this metric",
    "the equations of motion and the continuty equation take the form @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 as known , from ( 2.14 ) or from its equivalent form @xmath40 follows that @xmath41 where @xmath42 since @xmath43 .",
    "also we note that as @xmath44 eqs .",
    "( 2.12)-(2.13 ) transform to the usual friedmann equations of gr @xmath45 so we can rewrite the equations ( 2.12)-(2.13 ) as @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the k - essence contributions to the energy density and pressure .",
    "we also present the parameter of state @xmath48",
    "let us introduce the following form of the k - essence @xmath49 where @xmath50 $ ] and in general @xmath51 .",
    "but in this work we restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath52 the models of the form ( 3.1 ) are may be a new types of of k - essence . to solve the gravitional equations we use the reconstruction method ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "for example , we can look for @xmath53 as @xmath54 where in general @xmath55 .",
    "but in this paper we assume that @xmath56 .",
    "below we would like to construct some exact solutions of the equations ( 2.12)-(2.13 ) .",
    "for simplicity we assume that @xmath57 . here",
    "also we mention that as we assumed in the end of the introduction section , we work with the natural units where @xmath7 so that all variables are dimensionless . in particular , the variables ( constants ) @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath59 are dimensionless .",
    "eqs.(2.12)-(2.13 ) take the form @xmath60 @xmath61 note that @xmath62 and @xmath63      first we consider the case : @xmath65 . then @xmath66 let @xmath53 has the form @xmath67 so that @xmath68.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( 3.4 ) we obtain the following explicit form of the k - essence lagrangian @xmath69 at the same time , eq.(3.3 ) we gives @xmath70 for @xmath11 we get the following expression @xmath71=\\kappa^{-1}a_0 ^ 6\\mu_1 ^ 2e^{2st}\\cosh^{2l}[t].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding scalar function @xmath2 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 , \\quad l=2 + 3\\mu_1 , \\quad s=3\\mu_0 , \\quad h = slog[e]-l,\\quad \\phi_0=const$ ] . finally we get the following expressions for the density of energy and pressure : @xmath74      here we assume that @xmath75",
    ". then @xmath76 the hubble parameter we give in the form @xmath77 hence for the scale factor we obtain @xmath78e^{\\{\\mu_0t+0.5\\mu_3\\cosh^{-2}[t]\\}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath79 @xmath80 from ( 3.4 ) we get @xmath81 from ( 3.6 ) we obtain @xmath82 ^ 2e^{[6(\\mu_0t+0.5\\mu_3\\cosh^{-2}[t])]}\\cosh^{6(\\mu_1+\\mu_3)}[t].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the density of energy and pressure are given by @xmath83 @xmath84 respectively .",
    "finally we consider the example when @xmath85 so that the corresponding k - essence has the form @xmath86 we assume that @xmath53 given in the form @xmath87 so that for the scale factor we have the expression @xmath88 - 0.25\\mu_5\\cosh^{-4}[t]\\}}\\cosh^{(\\mu_1+\\mu_3+\\mu_5)}[t].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that if @xmath89 then the scale factor becomes @xmath90 + 0.25(\\mu_1+\\mu_3)\\cosh^{-4}[t]\\}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general as @xmath91 @xmath92 we need in the following formulas @xmath93 @xmath94 then eq.(3.4 ) gives @xmath95 after some algebra we get the following important expressions @xmath96,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97 @xmath98 ^ 2\\cosh^{6[\\mu_1+\\mu_3+\\mu_5)}[t]e^{\\{6[\\mu_0t+(\\mu_5 + 0.5\\mu_3 ) \\cosh^{-2}[t]-0.25\\mu_5\\cosh^{-4}[t]]\\}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence we can recover the function @xmath2 : @xmath99    finally we present the formulas for the density of energy and pressure : @xmath83 @xmath100",
    "now we would like to show that the above presented models at least for some values of the parameters @xmath59 admit the cosmic acceleration .",
    "we illustrate our arguments for example 2 ( @xmath75 ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath101 the corresponding acceleration is @xmath102 hence follows that @xmath103 so we have the acceleration phase . the exception is the case when @xmath104 that corresponds to the transition between the deceleration and acceleration phases .    for the equation of state we get @xmath105 - 6\\mu_3\\tanh^4[t]}{3(\\mu_0+\\mu_1\\tanh[t]+\\mu_3\\tanh^3[t])^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence we see that @xmath106 . here",
    "can be observed the last two phases     as a function of @xmath35 with @xmath107 . ]",
    "+ of the evolution of the universe : radiation dominated ( @xmath108 ) if @xmath109 or matter dominated ( @xmath110 ) if @xmath111 and late acceleration ( @xmath112 .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the equation of state @xmath113 as a function of @xmath35 with @xmath107 .",
    "we mention that in our natural units , constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 are dimensionless .     as a function of @xmath35 with @xmath107 . ]    at the same time , the deceleration parameter takes the form    @xmath114 - 3\\mu_3\\tanh^4[t]}{(\\mu_0 + \\mu_1\\tanh[t]+\\mu_3\\tanh^3[t])^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence we see that @xmath115 .",
    "so we find that our model predicts that the transition from deceleration to acceleration occurs at @xmath116 in early time .",
