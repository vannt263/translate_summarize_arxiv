    "let us consider a meson containing a single heavy quark q. in the infinite heavy quark mass limit the heavy quark spin @xmath2 and the total angular momentum of light degrees of freedom @xmath3 decouple",
    ". therefore q@xmath4 mesons can be classified in doublets labelled by @xmath5 and parity eigenvalues , the members of which are degenerate in mass . in the lowest lying states the orbital angular momentum of light degrees of freedom is l=0 and it results @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding doublet is composed by two states with @xmath7 .",
    "for l=1 we have the @xmath8 and @xmath9 doublets , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "let us focus on the case of charmed mesons and denote the members of the positive parity doublets as : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "conservation of parity , total angular momentum and heavy quark spin require that the strong decays d(@xmath9)@xmath14d@xmath15 proceed via a d - wave transition while the decays d(@xmath8)@xmath14d@xmath15 proceed via an s - wave transition . as a consequence ,",
    "the states with @xmath8 are expected to be broad , whereas those with @xmath9 are presumably narrow .",
    "last year some resonances were discovered which could be interpreted as @xmath8 states of c@xmath16 and c@xmath17 systems .",
    "these states constitute the subject of this talk .",
    "the non strange resonances are detected with broad width , as expected , whereas those with strangeness are observed to be very narrow .",
    "the discrepancy has given rise to various interpretations .",
    "after a description of the recent experimental observations we shall discuss several interpretations of the detected resonances through the analysis of their decay modes .",
    "last year belle observed two broad resonances containing a charm quark which could be identified as @xmath8 @xmath18 states  @xcite .",
    "these resonances are observed in b@xmath19 decays ( where d@xmath20 indicates @xmath21=1 states ) which have been studied using the d@xmath22 and d@xmath23 final states .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis carried out for the d@xmath24 final state includes the amplitude of the known d@xmath25 mode , possible contributions of the processes with virtual d@xmath26 and b@xmath26 production and an intermediate d@xmath27 broad resonance with free mass and width and assigned j@xmath28 quantum numbers .",
    "a fit of the projection of the dalitz plot to the @xmath29 axis , where the pion is the one having the smallest momentum , favours the presence of the scalar contribution .",
    "a similar analysis is performed for the d@xmath23 final state , obtaining the evidence for a broad resonance with j@xmath30 quantum numbers .",
    "the d@xmath27 and d@xmath31 mass distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ bellelarghi ] , whereas the mass and width of the broad states obtained by the fit are collected in table  [ tab : statilarghi ] .",
    "an analogous study has been carried out by focus collaboration @xcite , which considered both the @xmath32 and @xmath33 charge configurations . also in this case , a broad scalar contribution is requested in order to fit the @xmath34 mass distribution .",
    "the values of mass and width quoted by focus are collected in table  [ tab : statilarghi ] .",
    "although the values obtained for the mass of the scalar state are rather different , presumably as a consequence of the difficulty in fitting a scalar component , we include in table  [ tab : statilarghi ] the average of belle and focus data .",

[ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "to test the interpretation of the recently observed resonances as @xmath36 states of the @xmath37 doublet we have computed their strong and radiative decay rates in this hypothesis , using experimental masses . for non strange states we have obtained widths of several hundreds mev , consistently with the measurements , whereas for states with strangeness strong decay rates are obtained of the same order of the radiative ones , so that their total widths result to be very narrow , in agreement with the experimental observations . for the ratio @xmath38 our result is consistent with both measurements performed by belle .",
    "ratios of the same order are obtained for the radiative decays @xmath39 and @xmath40 , though such processes have not been observed yet . only upper limits at 90@xmath41  c.  l. are available , with which our results are in substantial agreement , as shown in table [ tab : frazioni ] .",
    "so we conclude that the experimental observations are compatible with the interpretation of these resonances as @xmath36 states of the @xmath37 doublet , although the question concerning the low masses of the states with strangeness remains an open issue .",
    "this interpretation , also proposed in  @xcite-@xcite , could be corroborated by a future observation of the other expected radiative decays .",
    "finally , we have predicted masses and widths for @xmath42 states of the @xmath37 doublet . for @xmath43 states ,",
    "we obtain a scenario similar to the corresponding one in the charm case , so that we expect that @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be observed as narrow resonances in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 systems . too heavy to be produced at b - factories",
    ", such resonances could be discovered in hadronic experiments like cdf , or through a lep data reanalysis .",
