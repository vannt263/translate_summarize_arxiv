    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve]b also clearly presents the existence of the large contrast between the peak luminosity and the late - phase luminosity in most sne  ibn . in stripped - envelope sne , the contrast between the peak luminosity and the luminosity at about 50  days after the lc peak remains within a factor of 10 as is expected in @xmath1-powered sne .",
    "most sne  ibn have a much larger luminosity contrast .",
    "even if sne are powered only by @xmath1 , there are several possible mechanisms to make a large luminosity contrast between the peak luminosity and late - phase luminosity .",
    "first , significant dust formation is observed in some sne  ibn .",
    "if the infrared contribution to the luminosity is not properly taken into account , the constructed luminosity will have an artificial luminosity decrease .",
    "the bolometric lcs of sne  ibn with filled symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] take the infrared luminosity contribution into account , while the others do not . even if we limit our samples to those with infrared , the above arguments on the luminosity contrast still holds .",
    "in addition , dust formation typically starts at around 50  days after the lc peak , but the rapid luminosity decrease is already found before around 50  days after the lc peak .",
    "thus , we argue that the large luminosity contrast is not always caused by the missed infrared contribution , and we generally see it in sne  ibn . another possible cause of the rapid decline is the insufficient gamma - ray trapping in sn ejecta .",
    "we discuss this possibility in section  [ sec : expprop ] and show that the large luminosity contrast is not due to the insufficient gamma - ray trapping .    to summarize the above arguments ,",
    "the major heating source which powers the peak luminosity of sne  ibn is not @xmath1 .",
    "especially , a large luminosity difference between the peak luminosity and the tail luminosity , which is not found in @xmath1-powered stripped - envelope sne , indicates that the radioactive decay of @xmath1  provides a little contribution to their bolometric lcs at least at their brightest phases . a rational guess to an alternative heating source is the interaction between sn ejecta and dense csm as their spectral type and color indicate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there can be exceptions like ogle-2012-sn-006 .",
    "we argue that the main heating source powering the peak luminosity of sne  ibn is the interaction in many cases .",
    "even if sne  iin and sne  ibn are both powered by the interaction , the lc decline rates of sne  ibn are generally much faster than those of sne  iin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve]b ) .",
    "the slow lc declines of sne  iin are mainly due to ongoing interaction between dense csm and sn ejecta .",
    "when sne are powered by the continuing interaction , the bolometric lcs show a power - law decline ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the slowly - declining lcs of sne  iin indicate that the interaction between sn ejecta and dense csm continues more than 100  days after the lc peak , and their progenitors should have sustained large mass - loss rates for more than about 50  years before their explosions to make the extended distribution of the dense csm @xcite .    the rapid lc declines in sne  ibn",
    "imply that their interaction between dense csm and sn ejecta ceases quickly , in contrast to sne  iin .",
    "this lc rapid decline is not just due to the difference in the csm compositions , as the interaction is a kinetic process and high - energy photons produced at the shock can be absorbed by heavier elements and re - emitted .",
    "indeed , the luminosity by the interaction stays high as long as the interaction continues in numerical simulations of the interaction between sn ejecta and hydrogen - free csm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we argue that the dense csm in sne  ibn are not extended as much as in sne  iin and only exist near their progenitors .",
    "this means that sn  ibn progenitors are likely to have large mass - loss rates only shortly before their explosion , contrary to long - sustained large mass - loss rates in sn  iin progenitors .",

    "similar properties are obtained even if we assume that the shock breakout does not occur in sne  iin @xcite .",
    "an interesting result found in fig .  [ fig : density ] is that csm density is similar in sn  ibn and iin progenitors .",

    "one possibility is that sne  ibn may suffer from large fallback and eject only small amount of @xmath1  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> bolometric light curves of type  ibn sne generally have a large contrast between peak luminosity and late - phase luminosity , which is much larger than those of @xmath0ni - powered sne . </S>",
    "<S> thus , most of them are likely powered by the interaction between sn ejecta and dense circumstellar media . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , type  ibn sne decline much faster than type  iin sne , and this indicates that the interaction in type  ibn sne ceases earlier than in type  iin sne . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we argue that type  ibn sn progenitors experience high mass - loss rates in a short period just before explosion , while type  iin sn progenitors have high mass - loss rates sustained for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that rise time and peak luminosity of type  ibn and type  iin sne are similar and thus , they have similar explosion properties and circumstellar density </S>",
    "<S> . the similar circumstellar density in the two kinds of sne may indicate that mass - loss rates of type  ibn sn progenitors are generally higher than those of type  iin as the wind velocities inferred from narrow spectral components are generally higher in type  ibn sne . we also show that @xmath1  mass and explosion energy of type  ibn sne may be smaller than those of other stripped - envelope sne , probably because they tend to suffer large fallback or some of them may not even be terminal stellar explosions . </S>"
