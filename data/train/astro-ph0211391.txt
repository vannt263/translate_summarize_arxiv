    "ic  2554 is a southern galaxy with a peculiar optical appearance .",
    "it is also known as se  72/1 ( srsic 1974 ) , eso  092-ig012 , and iras  100756647 .",
    "1 shows a deep optical image of ic  2554 ( laustsen , madsen & west 1987 ) revealing many bright knots as well as a network of dust lanes intersecting the main body of the galaxy .",
    "the optical extent of ic  2554 is 325 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "its irregular and asymmetric appearance has prompted the division into multiple components , roughly aligned north - south .",
    "lauberts et al .",
    "( 1978 ) describe ic  2554 as a ` fox - shaped ' system with a complex spiral pattern .",
    "they distinguish three components : two central condensations separated by 18  with optical velocities of 1230 and 1310  kms@xmath6  and a detached arm or satellite to the north ( 1190  kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "corwin et al . ( 1985 ) describe ic  2554 as a colliding pair ( ic  2554a and b , 08 apart ) with plumes .",
    "laustsen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) describe ic  2554 as a very disturbed pair of galaxies with a large number of emission nebulae , indicating high activity of star formation .",
    "lauberts ( 1982 ) and laustsen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) note ic  2554 as possibly disturbed by the elliptical galaxy ngc  3136b ( eso  092-g013 ) . but",
    "ic  2554 has also been classified as a peculiar barred spiral galaxy ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , where the northern spiral arm appears elongated .",
    "high - resolution hi  observations ( presented here ) are needed to study the gas dynamics of this complex system and distinguish between the numerous scenarios .",
    "close to ic  2554 ( see fig .  2 ) are three known galaxies : the elliptical galaxy ngc  3136b ( 1780  kms@xmath6 ) , the faint spiral eso  092-g009 and the galaxy rkk  1959 . for a summary of various optical properties of ic  2554 and",
