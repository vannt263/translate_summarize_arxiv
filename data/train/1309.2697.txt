    "circular planar electrical networks are a natural generalization of an idea from classical physics : that any electrical resistor network with two vertices connected to a battery behaves like one with a single resistor . when we embed a resistor network in a disk and allow arbitrarily many boundary vertices connected to batteries ,",

    "the local equivalences of electrical networks may easily be translated into operations on their medial graphs .",
    "most importantly , y-@xmath36 transformations become * motions * , as shown in [ motion ] , and replacing series or parallel edges with a single edge both correspond to * resolution * of lenses , as shown in figure [ lensresolution ] .",

    "a crossing may be broken in two ways : breaking outward from the corresponding edge of the underlying electrical network corresponds to contraction , and breaking along the edge corresponds to deletion . in the same way that contraction or deletion of an edge in a critical graph",
    "is not guaranteed to yield a critical graph , breaking a crossing in lensless medial graphs does not necessarily yield a lensless medial graph .",
    "not all breakings of crossings are valid , as some crossings may be broken in a particular way to create a dividing line .",
