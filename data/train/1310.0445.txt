    "cooling quantum systems to the lowest reachable temperatures is a goal with motivations arising both from fundamental and practical considerations .",
    "the ultimate control of microscopic systems in the ultracold regime allows for the full exploitation of quantum technologies as well as the understanding of the attainability of zero temperature .",
    "much of the focus in cooling has been on the manipulation of populations in energy levels , through coupling to external reservoirs , with the goal of increasing occupancy of the lowest energy levels . however , an alternative strategy consists of temporally manipulating a parameter of the system hamiltonian to reduce the energy content of each level while keeping occupancy invariant .",
    "these strategies are `` adiabatic '' in the fullest sense , both thermodynamic and quantum , as they neither change the entropy nor the energy distribution of the system .",
    "usual adiabatic protocols require changing a hamiltonian parameter such that the rate of change of the parameter times its duration is much smaller than its absolute initial value .",
    "this requirement severely constrains the cooling power , making adiabatic cooling techniques less favorable in those contexts where , in addition to the intrinsic dynamics , sources of decoherence and noise exist , hindering desired tasks such as quantum computation or simulation .",
    "techniques to achieve shortcuts to adiabaticity relax this condition by only requiring constancy of entropy at the initial and final times , but not necessarily at intermediate times . by identifying a global time invariant , temporal trajectories of the hamiltonian parameter can be found such that the final population distribution equals the initial one while all the energy eigenvalues are scaled down by a common factor .",
    "this cooling technique , known as `` frictionless cooling , '' sketched in the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , has been extended to an atomic framework  @xcite leading to an increasing number of applications  @xcite .",
    "adiabatic or frictionless cooling does not reduce the entropy of the system under consideration  @xcite , making it ineffective for situations in which entropy and phase space density play the leading role such as in triggering phase transitions . however , these techniques do reduce the temperature , with all the associated benefits in terms of state preparation  @xcite .",
    "examples include efficient fast decompression of @xmath0rb atoms in normal  @xcite and bose - condensed  @xcite states , which have been experimentally demonstrated , and detailed proposals for efficient fast atomic transport  @xcite and optimized sympathetic cooling  @xcite .    in harmonic potentials ,",
    "frictionless cooling is achieved by choosing the variability of the trap frequency as specified by the solution of a second order differential equation , the ermakov equation . in our earlier work",
    "@xcite , we had addressed the robustness of this protocol to realistic sources of uncertainties and errors , and had shown that the ermakov solution leads to minimum uncertainty wavepackets at both initial and final times . additionally , this protocol resulted in squeezing of the momentum variance , formally parametrized through bogoliubov transformations , during the dynamical evolution .",
    "this allowed us to use the degree of squeezing seen in the evolved solution as an effective measure of fidelity .",
    "however , the reasons behind the emergence of minimum uncertainty states at the final time , and not during intermediate times , were not made explicit . in this paper , we fill in some of these gaps in understanding this technique by considering the ehrenfest dynamics of the heisenberg operator equations for the time - dependent harmonic oscillator @xcite . in particular , the physical interpretation of variables in the ermakov construction ,",
    "the choice of boundary conditions , and the role of squeezing in the solution all become manifest .",
    "we also extend the construction to a special case where the dynamics is restricted to the class of generalized gaussian states , which results in the so - called effective gaussian dynamics ( egd ) approach @xcite . while both ehrenfest dynamics and egd approach are exact for quadratic potentials , more generally they are known to provide approximate but valid results specifically at short times @xcite , which makes them well - suited for application to frictionless cooling methods in their fastest regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide a brief introduction to the general heisenberg operator approach and the special egd case . in section iii this formalism is applied to the important case of harmonic oscillator or quadratic potential and provide a brief discussion of the resulting set of equations . in section iv we explicitly show the connection of our construction to frictionless cooling in the case of harmonic potentials . in section",
    "v we discuss possible extensions within the egd framework , with particular emphasis on the experimentally relevant case of optical dipole trapping .",
    "finally we conclude with some qualitative insights on the usefulness of heisenberg operator equations to further expand the concept of frictionless cooling .",
    "we begin our analysis considering a general time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the associated heisenberg equations are : @xmath2 writing each operator @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the expectation value so that @xmath5 , one can taylor expand the potential @xmath6 about @xmath7 resulting in the following pair of ehrenfest equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "writing down the corresponding evolution equations for @xmath10 leads to an infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "it is worth noting here that the functional form of @xmath6 is important in coupling higher moments to the evolution of the centroid variables .",
    "the infinite set of moment equations are typically truncated using one of a number of possible approximations , largely determined by the nature of the problem being addressed  @xcite .",
    "of course , one can truncate the infinite equations order by order which is equivalent to approximating any potential as a polynomial , where the degree is related to the order of the correlations that are retained .",
    "however , this truncation leads to the coupling of moments across different orders as soon as one goes beyond the second order .",
    "this results in higher - order moments becoming dynamically significant even if they were initially ( at @xmath11 ) zero .",
    "the only exception to this behavior is the special case of a quadratic potential where , at each order , the moment equations depend only on other moments of the same order .",
    "this is readily illustrated by writing down the second - order contributions @xmath12 the more general result for the evolution equations for higher - order moments can be readily written down , although with tedium increasing progressively with each order .",
    "it is clear that straight truncation up to second order may not be effective for arbitrary , non - quadratic potentials .",
    "improved accuracy in arbitrary potentials while keeping the number of ehrenfest equations finite is desirable . in this",
    "regard , another related method to truncate the infinite hierarchy of moment equations involves the use of a time - dependent variational approach in which the state of the system is assumed to remain in a general gaussian form .",
    "the major implication of the gaussian approximation is that higher - order correlations can be expressed in terms of one and two - point correlations alone , leading to a dramatic truncation in the space of variables . also , given that arbitrary operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 with @xmath16 = i c$ ] implies @xcite @xmath17 the general gaussian form obeys the uncertainty relation @xmath18 which helps to simplify the ehrenfest equations .",
    "the resulting egd is represented by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the expectation values of position and momentum , respectively . here , odd cumulants are identically zero and even cumulants can be written in terms of variable @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "we also introduce a new variable @xmath24 which , as is clear from its definition , reflects the correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "together , the four equations of motion fully describe the evolution of both the centroid and the spreading of the wave packet .    before considering the case of the time - dependent harmonic oscillator which serves as a useful paradigm for frictionless cooling methods ,",
    "an important difference between egd and the second - order truncation methods is worth noting .",
    "the second - order truncation consists of locally approximating an arbitrary potential by an effective quadratic one and , in keeping with the heisenberg picture , places no restrictions on the wavefunction .",
    "by contrast , the egd method assumes a gaussian state which in terms of the potential results in a polynomial approximation involving only even powers .",
    "thus , in the general case , these two approximations are different and are valid for differing evolution times . as we see in the next section ,",
    "an exception is the case of a harmonic potential where the two methods converge .",
    "given our motivation of connecting the ehrenfest equations to those seen in frictionless cooling methods , we specifically consider the case of a harmonic trap with a time - dependent angular frequency , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 . in this instance , both the more general approach eqs .",

    "( [ drho ] ) and ( [ dpi1 ] ) are completely decoupled , and one can look at the evolution of the mean position and momentum completely independently of the evolution of the respective fluctuations , allowing for an easy numerical integration . also , it is interesting that , due to the structure of the equations , eq .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath30 .",

    "first , the extended hamiltonian has a centrifugal barrier which prevents @xmath36 except in the trivial , classical limit in which we can assume @xmath37 .",
    "second , the quantum correction preventing null position fluctuations is proportional to the second power of the planck constant , consistently with the osmotic term present in the madelung - bohm form of the schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "third , it is simple to show that the effective potential for the fluctuating part  if expanded around the minimum for an oscillator with constant frequency  generates small fluctuations with average value oscillating harmonically in time ( ` breathing ' modes ) with frequency twice the oscillator frequency .",
    "this fact is exploited in stroboscopic quantum nondemolition measurements of position  @xcite .",
    "finally , the decoupling of the first and second moments is a particular case , for a single particle , of kohn s theorem valid in the more general situation of an interacting many - body system  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this section is to derive from the ehrenfest perspective the results of frictionless cooling as described in @xcite . in order to make this contribution self - consistent",
    ", we briefly recall that the ermakov trajectory , prescribing the time variation of the harmonic trapping frequency necessary for frictionless cooling , arises from the lewis - riesenfeld invariant @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 .",

    "we report the same quantities for the case of a linear ramping - down of the frequency occurring in the same time durations , showing that in the 25 ms case the harmonic oscillator performs several cycles with respect to the corresponding ermakov trajectory .",

    "( 3 ) in @xcite ) it is necessary that at @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "also the choice @xmath53 ensures that @xmath54 . at @xmath55",

    "these make sure that @xmath49 commutes with the hamiltonian at @xmath59 and that @xmath60 .",
    "these six boundary conditions suggests a fifth - order polynomial ansatz for @xmath61 , facilitating a solution of the ermakov equation for @xmath61 , and subsequently the explicit ermakov trajectory for the angular frequency @xmath62 .",

    "i.e. _ the standard deviation expressed in harmonic oscillator length units , @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this allows us to make the identification with the parameter @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ drho]-[dpi1 ] ) @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , one can condense the four equations eqs .",
    "( [ dx]-[dp1 ] ) , and eqs .",
    "( [ drho]-[dpi1 ] ) into two second - order differential equations @xmath68 where , again , eq . ( [ dp ] )",
    "is completely decoupled from eq .",
    "( [ dpi ] ) .",
    "the first is nothing but the newton equation for the harmonic oscillator while the equation for the spreading of the wave packet , eq .",
    "( [ dpi ] ) , can be rearranged as @xmath69 which coincides with the ermakov equation by identifying @xmath70 along with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the ermakov equation obtained through a proper , but less physically insightful , identification of an invariant naturally emerges here from the ehrenfest formulation@xcite .",
    "the identification of @xmath40 with @xmath22 also means that is not possible to impose dirichlet boundary conditions , since @xmath22 can not be zero .",
    "solving the equations under neumann boundary conditions makes clear the underpinning for the minimum uncertainty state seen at @xmath55 .",
    "additionally , one can identify @xmath72 .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed @xmath73 translate into @xmath74 . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we found that the ermakov trajectory requires a minimum uncertainty wavepacket at both initial and final times @xmath50 and @xmath55 which , in the terminology of the moments , equates to @xmath75 at these times .",
    "so when we follow the ermakov trajectory @xmath62 it is now not surprising that a minimum uncertainty state is achieved at @xmath55 , as this is _ enforced _ by the _",
    "unique _ choice of boundary conditions .",
    "notice also that the momentum variance , related to the temperature of the ultracold gas , can be written in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath43 as @xmath76 , from the uncertainty relation eq .",
    "( [ hup ] ) , which shows that momentum fluctuations are reduced if @xmath22 is made large and , simultaneously , @xmath47 .",
    "this relationship makes it clear that a mere increase of the position variance @xmath22 ( _ e.g. _ by directly relaxing the trap frequency ) with the goal of reducing the corresponding momentum variance does not necessarily work unless the system reaches a minimum uncertainty state at the final time .",
    "removal of squeezing correlations through @xmath75 is therefore the key step in a frictionless cooling scheme .",
    "furthermore , the boundary conditions @xmath77 imply @xmath78 , and eq .",
    "( [ dpi ] ) then gives the width @xmath22 consistent with the eigenstate of a harmonic trap with the correct angular frequencies at @xmath11 and @xmath59 , as it should .",
    "it is worth noting that in the true adiabatic limit one starts with a minimum uncertainty wavepacket ( associated with the initial frequency @xmath79 ) and it remains a minimum uncertainty packet for all times during the evolution .",
    "this requires @xmath47 and @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "any deviation from this leads to diabatic transitions which can be countered by non - zero values of @xmath43 .",
    "it is interesting that this is precisely the counter - diabatic anticommutator term found in other approaches to achieve shortcuts to adiabaticity @xcite .",
    "we have explicitly confirmed the validity of the ehrenfest dynamics and egd for the time - dependent quadratic potential by using the numerically obtained ermakov trajectory as the input for @xmath62 in eqs ( [ dx ] - [ dpi1 ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of the variables was found to be identical to those obtained by numerically integrating the full schdinger equation .",
    "this agreement holds even for trajectories involving short @xmath48 which includes an antitrapping stage .",
    "the gaussian ansatz of egd implies that the wave function remains a coherent state even in the presence of an inverted trap as the time is too short for the wave function to start breaking up .",
    "the phase space diagrams for @xmath46 _ vs. _ @xmath45 and @xmath22 _ vs. _ @xmath43 are shown in fig . 1 for different cooling protocols .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , we consider two representative final times in all of our simulations ",
    "@xmath82 ms and @xmath83 ms  where the 6 ms case involves an anti - trapping stage while the 25 ms case does not .",
    "we compare the ermakov trajectory ( top row ) to the case of a quasi - adiabatic protocol obtained with a linear ramp of the frequency in the same time interval ( bottom row ) .",
    "as expected , the ermakov trajectory gives @xmath75 at the end of the run , implying that the state returns to the minimum uncertainty state as a consequence of the imposed boundary conditions , while the linear ramp case shows non - zero final @xmath43 .",
    "a three - dimensional plot is presented in fig . 2 to show more explicitly the evolution of squeezing along the trajectories .",
    "a more direct representation of this dynamics in terms of the corresponding wigner function has been discussed in ref .",
    "fast expansion methods have also been discussed in the more realistic case of optical gaussian - beam traps in ref .",
    "this is a more intriguing case than usual magnetic traps since , unlike the latter , trapping frequencies along the radial and axial direction ( in the almost universally adopted confinement geometry with radial symmetry ) can not be independently controlled .",
    "nevertheless , optical dipole traps enjoy several advantages in ultracold atom experiments , among these the possibility to trap spinor condensates , the flexibility in independently using magnetic fields ( for instance to exploit magnetic feshbach resonances ) , the possibility to trap atoms with no permament magnetic moment , and the possibility for atomic control with higher spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to discuss to what extent frictionless cooling techniques may be applied to this important class of trapping schemes .",
    "we will deal with the simplest situation of a single gaussian beam of wavelength @xmath84 red - detuned with respect to the dominant atomic transition @xmath85 .",

    "this approach is also a simpler alternative to the search for ermakov invariants in higher dimensional spaces as discussed in @xcite since in our framework the time - dependent frequencies are related to second derivatives of the potential evaluated at the expectation values .",

    "one may therefore view the egd as generating a subspace of solutions that `` simulate '' the behavior of adiabatic following .",
    "alternatively , it can be viewed as a way to naturally include the counter - diabatic term in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "formally , one should be able to generalize this idea to any arbitrary eigenstates and trapping potentials . as mentioned above",
    ", the gaussian wave packet in a quadratic potential is the only case that involves a small number of tractable , closed set of equations as an infinite chain of equations involving all cumulants results in other situations ( for instance see @xcite for the application to a double - well system ) .",
    "however , it is reassuring that higher order cumulants do not play a significant role for short times , and therefore should not make invalid the dynamics in situations in which a very short duration of the protocol is chosen . in this sense , and noting that solutions which are less than absolutely optimal may be sufficient for some cooling situations , we suggest that this `` ansatz - enforced '' shortcut to adiabaticity may be applicable in more general situations",
    ". the procedure would start by truncating the taylor expansion around the centroid in the ehrenfest equations to @xmath140 terms , with the truncation being exact for potentials described by an @xmath140th order polynomial .",
    "this would result in a finite number of moment equations to be satisfied , instead of a single ermakov equation as in the case of a gaussian ansatz in a harmonic potential .",
    "one can proceed by solving iteratively a truncated set of cumulant equations with an appropriate ansatz imposed , using progressively more equations for higher accuracy .",
    "the high order moments could additionally be controlled by the imposition of appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "finally , it is noted that having @xmath141 one should also obtain a `` fast - adiabatic heating '' effect , and this observation is more transparent in the ehrenfest framework as this corresponds to generalized phase space trajectories for the cumulants related to fast - adiabatic cooling via time - reversal . the added ability to deal with more general potentials and targeted final thermal states may be relevant to recent research activity in the context of quantum engines @xcite .",
    "we also mention here an alternative way to speed up the time evolution of a quantum system , named `` fast - forward of adiabatic dynamics '' , see s. masuda and k. nakamura , phys .",

    "although similar in spirit to frictionless cooling , this technique differs from the latter as it relies on the application of driving potentials depending on the initial state , and does not deal explicitly with thermal states .",
    "the term  ehrenfest dynamics \" , though not commonly used among physicists , is quite established in other contexts .",
