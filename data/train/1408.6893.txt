    "a classical example of self - assembly is crystallization . at low temperatures",
    "the crystalline phase is typically stable , and thus grows spontaneously from solution through homogeneous nucleation .",
    "if several competing crystalline phases are allowed by microscopic interactions , the efficient production of a desired phase often requires heterogeneous nucleation from a seed of this phase , with precise annealing protocols @xcite .",
    "more complex microscopic interactions may lead to a glassy phase with many competing structures ; however , it is generally impossible to control local compositions or microscopic interactions to obtain a particular structure .",
    "recently , there has been a dramatic change in macromolecular and colloidal assembly techniques , made possible by the use of biopolymers , such as dna , to create a large variety of inter - component interactions .",
    "indeed , biomolecules offer exquisite control of microscopic interactions that allows self - assembly of diverse large structures .",
    "examples range from nanoparticle assemblies @xcite , which can also form macroscopic crystals @xcite , to structures using dna itself as a building material . in the latter case , dna origami uses short dna strands to controllably fold a long backbone strand into different well controlled structures @xcite , while short strands of dna by themselves can also build up complex three dimensional objects @xcite .",
    "similar efforts are underway using rationally - designed proteins by creating complementary binding sites on their surfaces @xcite .",
    "up until now , however , experimental and theoretical studies have been limited to devising interactions for the assembling a single structure .",
    "this is to be contrasted with biological systems , where many different self - assembled structures can be formed within the cell cytoplasm .",
    "these assembled structures can in fact share some of their components and can be dynamically induced independently from one another @xcite .    here , we propose a new mechanism for the self - assembly of many different structures from one large set of shared components .",
    "each structure is multifarious , i.e. , is made out of many different types of components .",
    "such self - assembling systems , which we propose calling `` multifarious assembly mixtures '' , are stable and yet responsive .",
    "this means that the mixtures do not form structures spontaneously , but can be controllably induced to assemble a specific structure .",
    "different structures are  encoded \" through the choice of molecular interactions and thus  stored \" in the mixture , to then be  retrieved \" by changing only a small number of parameters .    the theoretical framework introduced below allows calculation of the capacity of these systems , i.e.",
    ", how many different independent structures can be stored and retrieved in a mixture of @xmath0 species of components . in the traditional approach of self assembly without shared components , if each structure s is composed of the same number @xmath1 of different species , only @xmath2 different structures can be self - assembled .",
    "in contrast , in multifarious assembly mixtures , many more distinct structures can be stored .",
    "any stored structure can be retrieved with a ( super)critical nucleation seed .",
    "multiple seeds can induce the simultaneous assembly of multiple corresponding structures .",
    "moreover , we show that each different structure can be retrieved by changing only a small number of chemical potentials or interspecies interactions , where the number of tuned components is the number of components in a ( super)critical nucleation seed of the desired structure .",
    "classical nucleation theory implies that the size of this seed is only weakly dependent on the size of the structure that is built .",
    "consider @xmath0 species of interacting components in a solution kept at a constant temperature @xmath3 . in principle",
    ", each species can have a different chemical potential @xmath4 , @xmath5 , but for simplicity we assume for now that the chemical potentials have the same value @xmath6 .",
    "we would like the components to be able to self - assemble into one of @xmath7 distinct , multifarious structures , @xmath8 , on demand ( fig .",
    "[ fig : generalidea]a ) .    a typical multifarious structure @xmath9 is built of @xmath1 component species . in general , each species @xmath10 in the structure @xmath9 has its own multiplicity @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast to traditional studies of self - assembly , e.g. of crystals , where the same component species appears in many copies in the assembled structure , for multifarious assembly mixtures we are interested in the case of small values of @xmath11 . indeed , for simplicity , we assume here that all component species have a single copy in every stored structures , @xmath12 , so that the number of species @xmath1 used in the structure equals the size of the structure @xmath13 . additionally , we make a simplifying assumption that all the structure sizes @xmath14 have the same value @xmath15 , so @xmath16 .",
    "both cellular systems and recent dna - mediated assembly experiments show that a single structure @xmath9 can be robustly assembled if each pair of neighboring components , of species @xmath10 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) interact through a specific binding interaction .",
    "our next simplifying assumption is that all these interaction energies are equal : @xmath19 and we will also set all non - specific interactions to zero .",
    "the binding interactions between different components are mediated through a discrete number of  binding sites \" , with a species @xmath10 having a valence @xmath20 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that all components have the same valence @xmath21 .",
    "how might we choose an interaction energy matrix @xmath22 so that the components are capable of assembling different desired structures @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : generalidea]a ) ?",
    "the simplest general prescription that can work for arbitrary structures is to assume that two species @xmath10 and @xmath17 bind specifically with energy @xmath23 if and only if at least one of the desired structures @xmath9 requires this binding .",
    "such a matrix @xmath22 then has the potential for `` storing '' each structure @xmath9 as a local free energy minimum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : generalidea]b ) .",
    "this matrix can be written as , @xmath24 this form of energy matrix implies that component species can be promiscuous in their interactions . indeed , since a given species @xmath10 binds specifically to its partners in each of the stored structures , the total number of specific binding partners for species @xmath10 can be large .",
    "in addition to the free energy minima corresponding to the desired structures , other undesired local minima might emerge .",
    "these correspond to chimeric structures , or  chimeras \" , made of chunks of different desired structures that can bind together due to the promiscuity implied by eqn  .",
    "the stability of the stored structures is determined by the size of the free energy barriers between the different minima .",
    "for instance , if the barriers are low , chimeras will form spontaneously , even if their local free energy minima lie higher than those of desired structures ( fig .  [ fig : generalidea]a ) . similarly ,",
    "the free energy barriers between the solution of unbound components and other minima determines the solution s characteristic time @xmath25 , beyond which stored structures nucleate spontaneously and the process of the controlled retrieval of stored structures is compromised .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is the functional `` lifetime '' of the multifarious assembly mixture .",
    "how many different multifarious structures , each of size @xmath15 , can one store by using @xmath0 different species of components with well - chosen interspecies interactions defined by eqn  ?",
    "if each species contributed to only a single structure , the maximum capacity would be @xmath26 . by sharing species between structures , however ,",
    "a much larger number of structures can be stored before chimeras start to dominate .",
    "to find this increased capacity , consider components attaching to the boundary of a growing seed .",
    "the promiscuous interactions implied by eqn .   might allow the seed to bind different sets of components , resulting in chimeras .",
    "therefore , let us compute the number of species that can specifically bind to a given boundary site of the seed .",
    "since each component in the bulk of a stored structure has @xmath21 nearest neighbors , for an incoming component to bind stably , it must form specific bonds with @xmath27 components on the seed s boundary . due to the promiscuous nature of eqn .",
    ", each of these @xmath27 boundary components can bind specifically to a set of @xmath28 other species .",
    "is randomly constituted from the @xmath0 species , a given species will occur in @xmath28 of the @xmath7 stored structures and typically have a different partner in each of them .",
    "hence , a typical species will have @xmath28 specifically binding partners . ] for randomly constituted @xmath7 structures , each set contains a fraction @xmath29 of all the @xmath0 component species .",
    "the intersection of these @xmath27 sets , of the size @xmath30 , determines the species that can specifically bind to all the @xmath27 boundary components .",
    "when this number is larger than @xmath31 , many different species can attach to a given boundary site on a growing seed , resulting in a proliferation of chimeras .",
    "hence , the largest number @xmath7 of structures that can be stored is @xmath32 for @xmath33 , the exponent @xmath34 is positive and this equation implies that the capacity @xmath35 can be much larger than the traditional estimate of the capacity @xmath26 .",
    "it is instructive to understand why @xmath36 structures i.e. , linear chains , can not share components . binding to an end of a growing chain",
    "requires forming a bond with just one component .",
    "if that component is promiscuous , the seed can always grow in a non - unique chimeric manner .",
    "hence the promiscuity of individual species , implied by eqn  , must be countered by the requirement on incoming particles to form multiple ( i.e. , @xmath27 @xmath37 ) bonds .",
    "the above argument shows that the number of structures that can be stored and stabilized with @xmath0 components is large . for this to be useful",
    ", we need to be able to retrieve each of them easily .",
    "the retrieval can be done in three different ways .",
    "one can introduce a nucleation seed , i.e. , a part of a stored structure , into the solution .",
    "alternatively , one can enhance the formation of such a seed by increasing the chemical potential of its components by an appropriate amount @xmath38 , or by strengthening the interactions @xmath39 by @xmath40 for bonds found in such a seed .",
    "these methods enhance the nucleation of one stored structure without nucleating others , despite all stored structures being made of the same set of components .",
    "such selective nucleation is possible only for multifarious structures ; it relies on the fact that small contiguous subsets of distinct structures typically have distinct compositions .",
    "such subsets can be used as selective nucleating seeds , or to selectively lower the nucleation barrier for one structure using the other two methods described above .",
    "the critical question is how many different species have to be tuned in this way to successfully retrieve a particular stored structure .",
    "the answer follows directly from general nucleation theory , which specifies a critical nucleation radius @xmath41 in terms of the chemical potential @xmath6 and bond energy @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the minimal seed size @xmath43 needed to recover a structure is set by @xmath41 ; smaller seeds dissolve back into components while larger seeds are supercritical and grow into stored structures .",
    "we can make the multifarious assembly mixture responsive to smaller seeds by lowering the critical nucleation radius , for example , by lowering the ratio @xmath44 of chemical potential to bond energy ( see si text and si figs .",
    "s2 , s5 and s6 ) .",
    "however , lowering the critical nucleation radius also lowers the barrier to spontaneous homogenous nucleation . as noted above , critical seeds can spontaneously assemble on a characteristic timescale @xmath25 and grow into random stored structures , without any external input .",
    "thus , at a minimum , we need @xmath25 to be much longer than the retrieval time , i.e. , time necessary for a supercritical seed to grow into a full structure .",
    "nucleation theory , adapted to multifarious @xmath45-dimensional structures , determines @xmath25 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the free energy barrier , @xmath48 is the free energy per area required for creating the critical seed and @xmath49 is a time scale connected with microscopic processes . the second term on the right hand side arises because we must account for the multiplicity @xmath50 of distinct nucleation paths leading to the @xmath7 different stored structures . for small @xmath7 , we can estimate @xmath51 to account for critical seeds from different parts of the @xmath7 stored structures of size @xmath15 each ( see si text ) .",
    "for a fixed @xmath52 , eqn .   can be solved for the nucleation radius @xmath41 , and hence the minimal number of components @xmath43 that must be tuned to retrieve a structure . if all the components have a typical size @xmath53 , this number @xmath43 is of order @xmath54 where @xmath55 depends only weakly ( logarithmically ) on @xmath7 , @xmath15 and @xmath52 .",
    "we thus conclude , that since @xmath43 is determined by the nucleation barrier , it is essentially independent of the size of the structure , @xmath15 , that is being retrieved .",
    "note that the above equations show an unavoidable trade - off : increasing the lifetime of the multifarious assembly mixture @xmath25 necessarily increases the nucleation radius @xmath41 and hence increases @xmath43 .",
    "thus a more stable multifarious assembly mixture requires a larger seed for recovering stored structures .      in order to study different regimes of self - assembly of multifarious structures , we have considered assembly based on eqn .  , on a simple @xmath56 square lattice .",
    "individual components are square tiles that can be one of @xmath57 species .",
    "all @xmath7 stored structures consist of @xmath58 tiles , each tile being of different species positioned inside a @xmath59 square block .",
    "more precisely , we assume that all the species are present in all the structures , and each species appears only once in each structure , @xmath60 for all @xmath10 and all @xmath9 , so that @xmath61 for all structures @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , each stored structure is simply a different random permutation of the tiles inside the square block .",
    "we assume that each tile component can bind up to @xmath62 neighbors through specific binding interactions given by eqn  , and that all species of tiles have the same chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "we run grand canonical monte carlo simulations with different numbers @xmath7 of stored structures on a square lattice of total size @xmath63 , for different values of temperature @xmath3 and chemical potential @xmath6 ( see si text and si fig .",
    "s3 ) .    starting from a particular supercritical seed ( of linear size @xmath64 ) of one of the @xmath7 stored structures , fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] shows a diagram of the different outcomes of our simulations , as a function of the number of stored structures , @xmath7 , and the temperature @xmath3 ( or more precisely , @xmath65 , where @xmath42 is the specific binding energy ) , for a fixed @xmath6 .",
    "we visualize the different stored structures with different colors , with the desired structure colored in dark red . for low @xmath7 and @xmath3",
    ", the supercritical seed indeed grows into the desired structure . in this regime of parameter space ( regime i ) , the solution behaves as a useful multifarious assembly mixture : the mixture is stable for a long time @xmath25 and stored structures can be retrieved through heterogeneous nucleation . , is much longer than the timescale for recovery , @xmath66 .",
    "thus , even though the monte carlo dynamics do not reflect the dynamics of a realistic self - assembly system ( see e.g.@xcite ) , they do substantiate the predictions of nucleation theory , and expose different regimes of self - assembly of multifarious structures . ] for higher number of stored structures @xmath7 ( and at higher temperatures @xmath3 ) another behavior appears ( regime ii ) .",
    "it is characterized by the spontaneous homogeneous nucleation of all stored structures from the solution : in this regime , the multifarious assembly mixture is too short lived to allow the structure retrieval , i.e. , @xmath25 becomes comparable to the time taken for a supercritical seed to grow into a full desired structure , @xmath66 . at even higher values of @xmath7",
    "we find yet another regime of behavior ( regime iii ) , where chimeric structures dominate .",
    "finally , at high temperatures @xmath3 , and for all values of @xmath7 , we encounter regime iv , where any initial seed disintegrates into small clusters of individual components .",
    "the extent of different regimes depends of course on the chosen model parameters .",
    "in particular , the chemical potential @xmath6 influences the extent of regimes i and ii ( see si text and si figs .  s7 and s9 ) .",
    "simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffsa ] confirm that , in regime i , the assembly of a structure can be triggered not only with supercritical nucleating seeds , but also by enhancing the chemical potential of a small set of tile species , or by increasing the bond energies between the tile species from such a set .",
    "numerical simulations are also a way to gauge the capacity of an multifarious assembly mixture to store structures , and to compare it with the theoretical predictions presented above .",
    "to do this , we have introduced the entire target structure as a supercritical seed , and have examined it after a fixed simulation time chosen to be shorter than the mixture s lifetime @xmath25 .",
    "we have assessed the quality of retrieval by measuring the error , i.e. , the fraction of the final assembled structure that differs from the initial target structure ( see si text and si fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]a depicts the error as a function of the number of stored structures @xmath7 , for different number of particle species @xmath0 ( structure sizes being @xmath58 ) , at fixed temperature @xmath3 and chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "there is a transition at critical value @xmath67 , above which the error rises rapidly .",
    "we show that the error curves for different @xmath0 collapse onto each other when plotted against @xmath68 , fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]b , where @xmath35 increases with increasing @xmath0 as @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the prediction of eq .   that the memory capacity scales as @xmath71 , for the square lattice model with @xmath62 nearest neighbors ( see si text ) .",
    "finally , we have also assessed the trade - off , expressed in eqn  , between the stability of the multifarious assembly mixture , i.e. , its lifetime @xmath25 , and the minimal size @xmath43 of a seed needed for retrieval ( fig  [ fig : tplots ] ) .",
    "the minimal seed size @xmath43 increases slowly with increasing @xmath25 , and remains a small fraction of the total number of components ( @xmath72 , in this case ) in a stored structure .",
    "the number of stored structures @xmath7 has only a modest effect on @xmath43 , in agreement with eqn   ( see si text and si fig .",
    "s7 ) .      to conclude",
    ", we have demonstrated that it is possible to store multiple structures in a solution of components with designed interactions between them . using @xmath0 different component species",
    ", we can store as many as @xmath73 different multifarious structures of size @xmath15 and of average coordination number @xmath21 . in an extended region of parameter values",
    "( e.g. , temperature , chemical potentials , binding energies ) , such a  multifarious assembly mixture \" with many stored structures is both stable and responsive ; each of the multifarious structures can be selectively grown ( retrieved ) by modifying chemical potentials or binding energies of only a small fraction of the @xmath0 component types , or by introducing an appropriate seed .",
    "the model that we have explored is very similar to the way associative neural networks , such as hopfield s classical networks @xcite store multiple memories in a distributed way . in these models ,",
    "a neural network is programmed to have multiple stable states , i.e. , memories , using a prescription for neuronal connections that is very similar in spirit to the pooled energy matrix in eqn  .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if the number of programmed memories is sufficiently small , each memory is indeed a stable state and can be recovered through initial conditions in a robust manner . however , if the number of stored memories exceeds the capacity of the network , recovery is spoiled by the presence of many `` spurious memories ''  undesired stable states  resulting in regimes @xcite similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] . a distinctive feature of multifarious assembly mixtures , however , is that we require the stability of the unassembled mixture itself for a long time @xmath25 , in addition to the stability of the stored structures ( see si text ) .    in our simulated lattice model , different stored structures have identical components rearranged in random permutations .",
    "thus stored structures are assumed to be independent , or ",
    "orthogonal \" , as in the case of stored memories in the original hopfield model @xcite .",
    "an important extension of the present model would be to study stored structures with built - in correlations , such as the presence of shared modules . after all , the controlled assembly of chimeric structures could be useful .",
    "it is also important to stress that designing specific binding interactions between different components based on superposition ( eqn  ) , is not the only way to create functional multifarious assembly mixtures .",
    "although it is arguably the simplest prescription that works for generic structures , other non - linear prescriptions can be tailored for particular structures by exploiting structural motifs ( e.g. , creating multifarious assembly mixtures with higher capacity or longer lifetimes ) .",
    "such tailored interactions have been used to store and retrieve a particular set of structures composed of a small number of component species in recent work on dna programmed assembly @xcite . in similar vein",
    ", the ability of a protein sequence to code for multiple stored internal structures has been studied in the context of protein folding @xcite .    beyond immediate applications to artificial systems with controllable binding specificity , the present model proposes a new paradigm to understand molecular aggregates in biology .",
    "for instance , our calculations show that instead of creating new proteins for every individual structure , it is more efficient if individual proteins are used in a multiplicity of structures , as is the case in many cellular assemblies , ranging from transcription factors @xcite to ribonucleoproteins such as spliceosomes @xcite .",
    "our calculations also indicate that such versatility can be quite high , increasing rapidly with the number of different component species in the pool .",
    "nonetheless , different structures can be selectively assembled by reprogramming molecular interactions , e.g. by a simple modulation of the expression levels , or of the specific binding energies via post - translation modifications , of a small number of selected components .",
    "this is indeed what seems to happen often in cellular assembly .",
    "we hope that the theoretical framework presented here , properly generalized to far - from - equilibrium situations , will form a basis for quantitative studies of functioning , regulation and evolution of biological assembly .",

    "in fact , a recently studied @xcite @xmath56-lattice neural network , albeit with long - ranged interactions , is closely related to the large coordination number @xmath21 limit of our model .",

    "however , a crucial intrinsically - kinetic feature of multifarious assembly mixtures , not found in neural networks , is the stability of the unassembled mixture itself . as we showed in the paper , the unassembled mixture has a finite lifetime @xmath25 after which random stored structures are spontaneously nucleated .",
    "this lifetime @xmath25 is set by the ratio @xmath44 of chemical potential to bond energy and hence , in principle , is independent of structure size @xmath15 and can stay finite in the thermodynamic limit .    as a result , for multifarious assembly mixtures ,",
    "the question of practical interest is a finite - time kinetic question  can one recover specific structures using seeds in a time shorter than @xmath25 ? to focus on this question , we define capacity and the transition to chimeric phase through a practical finite - time notion of error  we introduce an initial seed and measured error in recovery after a finite simulation time chosen to be much smaller than the lifetime of the mixture .",
    "a thermodynamic analysis of our model would require a modified set of quantities and parameter limits .",
