    "for a long time , the inflationary scenario has been regarded as an academic theory which provides an elegant solution to conceptual problems in cosmology such as the flatness problem , the horizon problem , and the origin of structure of the universe .",
    "however , the fact that all of recent cosmological observations strongly support the inflationary scenario with high precision encourages us to take the inflation more seriously .",
    "then , taking into account that the inflation magnifies microscopic scales to macroscopic ones , it is reasonable to regard the inflation as a probe to investigate physics at the planck scale , namely , quantum gravity .",
    "it is widely believed that string theory is a promising candidate for quantum gravity .",
    "however , it is premature to discuss a planckian regime of the universe using string theory .",
    "therefore , so far , study of trans - planckian effect on inflationary predictions has been phenomenological  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are various phenomenological models which can mimic trans - planckian physics and lead to a modification of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations  @xcite .",
    "it is known that these quantitative trans - planckian corrections are suffered from severe constraints due to the backreaction problem  @xcite .",
    "however , there may be more qualitative effects due to trans - planckian physics .",
    "for example , polarization of primordial gravitational waves could be an important smoking gun of trans - planckian physics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a parity violating gravitational chern - simons term which is ubiquitous in string theory can generate circular polarization in primordial gravitational waves  @xcite . however , it has been shown that the effect of parity violation is negligibly small for the slow roll inflation  @xcite .",
    "recently , it is argued that sizable circular polarization could be generated  @xcite by resorting to a peculiar feature due to the gauss - bonnet term  @xcite .",
    "one defect in these models is the appearance of divergence in one of circular polarization modes .",
    "this divergence suggests necessity of a consistent quantum theory of gravity .",
    "recently , quantum gravity at a lifshitz point which is power - counting renormalizable is proposed by ho@xmath0ava  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to string theory , the theory is not intended to be a unified theory but just quantum gravity in 4-dimensions . in this",
    " small \" framework , one can discuss trans - planckian effect on cosmology in a self - consistent manner . in ho@xmath1ava s formulation of quantum gravity , the action necessarily contains a cotton tensor , which violates parity invariance .",
    "hence , we can expect circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "moreover , there exists no divergence in this model .",
    "then , the purpose of this paper is to calculate degree of circular polarization during inflation and show observability of chiral primordial gravitational waves which is a robust prediction of quantum gravity at a lifshitz point .",
    "the quantum gravity proposed by ho@xmath1ava can be characterized by anisotropic scaling at an ultraviolet fixed point @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are a scaling factor , spacial coordinates and a time coordinate , respectively .",
    "this scaling guarantees the renormalizability of the theory  @xcite . because of the anisotropic scaling",
    ", the time direction plays a privileged role .",
    "in other words , the spacetime has a codimension - one foliation structure in which leaves of the foliation are hypersurfaces of constant time .",
    "since the spacetime has the anisotropic scaling and the foliation structure , the theory is not diffeomorphism invariant but invariant under the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism defined by @xmath6 here , indices @xmath7 represent spacial coordinates .    to describe the foliation ,",
    "it is convenient to use adm decomposition of the metric @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the lapse function , the shift function and the 3-dimensional induced metric , respectively . in order for the theory to be unitary , the number of time derivative should be at most two in the action .",
    "the renormalizable kinetic part is then given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the extrinsic curvature of the constant time hypersurface defined by @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the trace part of @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are dimensionless coupling constants which run according to the renormalization group flow .",
    "hereafter , we assume @xmath17 has already settled down to the infrared fixed point @xmath18 at the beginning of the inflation although we keep @xmath17 in subsequent formulas .",
    "the most crucial assumption of ho@xmath1ava s theory is the detailed balance condition @xmath19 where we have defined @xmath20 / \\delta g_{ij } $ ] with some functional @xmath21 . here",
    ", we introduced the inverse of de witt metric @xmath22 the renormalizability of the theory requires @xmath23 must be third order in spatial derivatives .",
    "the requirement uniquely selects the cotton tensor @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the totally antisymmetric tensor and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the 3-dimensional ricci tensor and ricci scalar . including relevant deformations",
    ", we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are christoffel symbols and the 3-dimensional  cosmological constant \" , respectively . here , we have introduced new coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the first two terms lead to the cotton tensor .",
    "thus , we obtain the potential part of the 4-dimensional action  @xcite @xmath33 \\ ,          \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a stroke @xmath34 denotes a covariant derivative with respect to spacial coordinates . in the above action ( [ action ] ) ,",
    "the coefficient of scalar curvature @xmath27 is @xmath35 , then the gravitational constant become negative in the low energy limit unless @xmath36 .",
    "in addition to this gravity sector , we consider the action for an inflaton @xmath37 @xmath38 \\ .",
    "\\label{inflaton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us assume the slow roll inflation and take the slow roll limit .",
    "then , we can replace the action ( [ inflaton ] ) with the effective cosmological constant @xmath39 , namely , we have @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the total action is given by @xmath41 .",
    "the total action @xmath42 breaks the detailed balance condition softly  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the total action @xmath42 reduces to the conventional einstein theory at low energy .",
    "let us consider the background spacetime with spatial isotropy and homogeneity @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the scale factor . using this metric ansatz",
    ", we can get the friedmann equation with @xmath45 @xmath46 the above equation leads to de sitter spacetime , @xmath47 . here",
    ", we assumed @xmath48 . note that if we chose @xmath49 , there is no minkowski solution .",
    "hence , there must exist residual vacuum energy in the matter sector at the end of the day .",
    "this is related to the issue of the cosmological constant , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "now , we consider tensor perturbations @xmath50 where @xmath51 satisfies the transverse - traceless conditions",
    ". substituting this metric into the total action , we obtain the quadratic action @xmath52 , \\label{qaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 represents the laplace operator .",
    "the transverse traceless tensor @xmath51 can be expanded in terms of plane waves with wavenumber @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 are circular polarization tensors which are defined by @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath58 and @xmath59 modes are called the right handed mode and the left handed mode , respectively .",
    "we also impose normalization conditions @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the complex conjugate of @xmath62 . substituting the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) into the gravitational action ( [ qaction ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath63   \\ . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the variable @xmath64 and conformal time @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 , we obtain the equations of motion @xmath67 where we used @xmath68 and defined @xmath69 we have also defined @xmath70 here , @xmath71 is `` the emergent speed of light ''  @xcite and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are dimensionless parameters .    since there appears @xmath74 in eq.([veom ] )",
    ", the evolution of right handed mode is different from that of left handed mode .",
    "hence , the dimensionless parameter @xmath73 characterizes `` the parity violation '' . if @xmath75 and @xmath71 is exactly the speed of light , eq.([veom ] ) becomes the equation for gravitational waves in pure de sitter background in einstein theory .",
    "then @xmath72 measures the `` deviation from einstein theory '' .",
    "now , we calculate the power spectrum @xmath76 numerically and evaluate degree of circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves .    for the numerical analysis , it is convenient to introduce dimensionless variables @xmath77 and @xmath78 . using these variables and the transformation @xmath79",
    ", we can write down the basic equation @xmath80 where @xmath81 since wkb approximation is pretty good in the asymptotic past @xmath82 , we can choose the adiabatic vacuum as the initial condition . more precisely , we set the positive frequency modes as @xmath83 on superhorizon scales @xmath84 , eq.([ode ] ) has asymptotic solution @xmath85 with constants of integration @xmath86 and @xmath87 . hence , the power spectrum defined by @xmath88 reduces to @xmath89 on superhorizon scales @xmath84 .",
    "so , we only need to calculate @xmath90 using eq.([ode ] ) with the initial condition ( [ baric ] ) .",
    "notice that the power spectrum @xmath91 is scale free . from the mode function ( [ baric ] )",
    ", we see the vacuum depends on the chirality . in the wkb regime",
    ", the amplitude of the right handed mode grows , while that of the left handed mode decays .",
    "these two effects make the difference . in fig.[fig:1 ] , we plotted the time evolution of the power for a right handed mode and a left handed mode and also displayed the case of einstein theory for comparison .",
    "clearly , one can see that the differences of initial amplitude and the growth rate during wkb regime lead to circular polarization .",
    "now , we are in a position to discuss observability of circular polarization . for this aim , we need to quantify polarization by defining degree of circular polarization @xmath92 numerical results are plotted in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "there are two possible channels to observe circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "one is the in - direct detection of circular polarization through the cosmic microwave background radiation , the required degree of circular polarization has been obtained as @xmath93 in @xcite , where @xmath94 is the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "the relevant frequency of gravitational waves in this case is around @xmath95 hz . from fig.[fig:2 ] , supposing @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we see we can detect the circular polarization through the temperature and b - mode polarization correlation if @xmath98 .     for various @xmath73 as a function of @xmath72 are shown .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , @xmath99 grows as the @xmath72 becomes large .",
    "the dependence on @xmath73 is not monotonic rather there is a value which gives the maximum polarization for fixed @xmath72.,width=302 ]    the other is the direct detection of circular polarization , the required degree of circular polarization has been estimated as @xmath100 around the frequency @xmath101 hz  @xcite , where @xmath102 is the density parameter of the stochastic gravitational waves and snr is the signal to the noise ratio  @xcite . here , 10 years observational time is assumed .",
    "taking look at fig.[fig:2 ] , one can see it is easy to get the circular polarization of the order of @xmath103 in the present model .",
    "hence , we can prove or disprove quantum gravity at a lifshitz point by these observations .",
    "we have considered the inflationary scenario in the context of quantum gravity at a lifshitz point which is supposed to be a power - counting renormalizable theory . because of the detailed balance condition",
    ", the action necessarily contains cotton tensor which violates the parity invariance .",
    "we have calculated degree of circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves . as a consequence",
    ", we find that chiral primordial gravitational waves exist for generic parameters .",
    "it should be emphasized that the existence of circular polarization is a robust prediction of the theory .    in the usual discussions on the trans - planckian effects ,",
    "phenomenological approaches have been adopted and mostly a modification of the spectrum has been discussed . while , we have used a candidate of quantum gravity and discussed chirality of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the point is that we have found a modification of nature of gravitational waves rather than a modification of shape of the spectrum for gravitational waves .",
    "it is also apparent that the power spectrum for curvature perturbations is scale free .",
    "thus , quantum gravity at a lifshitz point is consistent with all of current observations .",
    "moreover , we have a testable smoking gun of quantum gravity .",
    "there are many issues to be pursued .",
    "one of those is to find exact solutions which represent black holes .",
    "when black hole solutions are found , it is very interesting to examine their spacetime structures , thermodynamics and hawking radiation",
    ". it would be also intriguing to apply the idea of the anisotropic scaling in gravity to braneworld cosmology  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility to generalize the anisotropic scaling in gravity to the cases where spatial isotropy is broken would be interesting from the point of anisotropic inflationary scenarios  @xcite .",
