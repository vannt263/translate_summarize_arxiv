    "[ fig : allob ]    the magnetic cataclysmic variable ( mcv ) star gk per underwent an unusual dwarf - nova - like outburst in 20062007 .",
    "this system , which is not a typical cv as it has a red - dwarf secondary and a 2-day orbital period ( crampton , cowley &  fisher 1986 ; morales - rueda 2002 ) , has been observed to undergo outbursts roughly every 3 years ( e.g.  sabbadin & bianchini 1983 , simon 2002 ) . its long orbital period and the fact that it is an intermediate polar ( ip , i.e.  the white - dwarf primary has a moderately strong magnetic field which truncates the inner accretion disc ; watson , king &  osborne 1985 ) make gk per different from most dwarf novae ( dne ) .",
    "the outbursts are still believed to be analogous to normal dn outbursts , i.e.  they are thought to be caused by enhanced mass transfer through the accretion disc due to thermal instability therein ( e.g.  bianchini , sabbadin &  hamzaoglu 1982 ; simon 2002 , bianchini 2003 ) .",
    "gk per has been well studied in quiescence and outburst .",
    "its x - ray emission is modulated at the 351-s white - dwarf rotational period ( watson 1985 ) in quiescence and outburst . in outburst",
    "the modulation is strong and single peaked , whereas in quiescence it is weak and double peaked ( watson 1985 ; norton , watson &  king 1988 ; hellier , harmer &  beardmore 2004 ) .",
    "modulation at this period has also been seen in optical spectroscopy ( morales - rueda , still &  roche 1999 ) and photometry ( patterson 1991 ) .",
    "the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) archive contains data extending back to 1904 , with frequent observations beginning in 1919 . from 1954 onwards",
    "the light curve shows regular outbursts , peaking typically around 10th magnitude . in fig .",
    "[ fig : allob ] we show the aavso light curve of every outburst found in a visual inspection of the dataset . as can be immediately seen , the 2006 outburst is fainter than most , and shows an unusual morphology .",
    "it is , however , similar to the 1967 outburst .",
    "the coverage of gk per at x - ray and uv wavelengths is not as extensive as in the optical , however it has been observed in quiescence and outburst in both bands .",
    "observations with _ ginga _",
    "1992 ) and _ exosat _ ( norton 1988 ; watson 1985 ) show that in hard x - rays ( 210 kev ) the typical outburst flux is 10 times the quiescent flux .",
    "these , and rxte observations ( hellier 2004 ) show the typical outburst 210 kev flux to be 2.5@xmath0 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "gk  per is 470 pc away ( mclaughlin 1960 ) , thus @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "_ iue _ observed gk per both in quiescence ( bianchini &  sabbadin 1983 ) and outburst ( rosino , bianchini &  rafanelli 1982 ) , and saw a flux ratio of 30 between the two observations at 2600   .",
    "the 2006 outburst of gk per was announced by brat ( 2006 ) on 2006 december 18 .",
    "examination of the aavso light curve shows the outburst to have begun on december 11 ; hereafter we use 2006 december 11 at 00:00 ut ( = jd 2454080.5 ,  met 187488001.6 s ) as the start time of the outburst ( hereafter ` t0 ' ) .",
    "we obtained target of opportunity observations with  ( gehrels 2004 ) which began on 2006 december 20 and were repeated regularly throughout the outburst .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      one of the signatures of ips is that their emission is modulated on the white - dwarf spin period . for gk per this is 351 s ( watson 1985 ; mauche 2004 ) .",
    "we folded the x - ray and uv data for each observation on this period  using the same arbitrary zero - point ( t0 + 52.65 s , in the barycentric frame ) each time .",
    "the resultant folds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] .    as can be seen the shape , magnitude and phase of spin minimum changes from observation to observation .",
    "this behaviour has been seen in quiescence , both in x - rays ( norton 1988 ) and in the @xmath3 ratios of the h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 balmer lines ( garlick 1994 ) .    in some cases",
    "the shape of the profile is the same in both wavebands and in others they differ ( for example , observation 001 has a roughly sawtoothed profile in each band whereas the uv profile in observation 009 is much more symmetric than the x - ray profile ) .",
    "unfortunately the individual observations contain too few counts for a meaningful phase - resolved spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we are reluctant to combine observations for this purpose because of the pulse - profile evolution .",
    "instead we created hardness ratios and folded these on the spin period .",
    "because the source is so heavily absorbed it was necessary to use the 410/0.34 kev hardness ratio in order to have sufficient counts in the ` soft ' band , however even with this ratio the rate in that band is so low that large bins and hence low time resolution is necessary .",
    "the hardness ratio spin folds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hardspin ] .",
    "little significant modulation is seen , however this is not entirely surprising : the spin - period modulation is thought to be an absorption effect ( hellier 2004 ; vrielmann 2005 ) , and our hardness ratio is not especially sensitive to absorption .    a 5000-s quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) has been previously reported in gk per outburst observations ( e.g.  watson 1985 ; hellier 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the orbital period of  is close to this ; we thus do not consider the qpo further in this paper .",
    "we have presented a high - quality multi - wavelength dataset covering the 2006 outburst of gk per , which shows that this was an atypical event . lasting 2030 days longer than a typical outburst",
    ", the optical brightness peaked 1.5 magnitudes below that seen in most previous events .",
    "the 2600   uv flux is similarly reduced compared to previous outbursts .",
    "in contrast , the hard x - ray flux is consistent with that seen in previous outbursts .    at first glance",
    "these statements seem paradoxical .",
    "the optical flux tracks the disc brightness .",
    "this brightness indicates the extent of the region of the disc which is in outburst .",
    "thus the lower luminosity seen in 2006 suggests that less of the disc was in outburst than in previous years , hence less mass was transferred through the disc .",
    "this is further supported by fig .",
    "[ fig : fluence ] , which showed the optical fluence of the 2006 outburst to be abnormally low .",
    "in contrast , the hard x - ray flux in ips is often assumed to track the rate of accretion onto the white dwarf .",
    "the typical outburst x - ray flux seen in 2006 , combined with the long duration of this outburst , therefore implies that more mass was accreted in 2006 than during typical outbursts .",
    "these inferences can not both be true .",
    "a resolution of this apparent inconsistency lies in the joint x - ray and uv spectral fit ( section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "this revealed that the proportion of the accretion flux emitted in the 210 kev band could be as little as 1% of the total radiated accretion flux : the flux in this energy range is clearly not a good proxy for the accretion rate .    in order to understand the unusual nature of the 2006 outburst",
    "we must consider the accretion disc , since dn outbursts are thought to be disc - instability events ( e.g.  lasota 2001 ) .",
    "gk  per is an atypical dn as it is an ip , thus the inner disc is missing .",
    "although this may have an effect on the shape and duration of outbursts in gk  per compared to other dne , it is unlikely to be the cause of the unusual nature of the 2006 outburst , since the magnetic field of the white dwarf should affect all outbursts in a similar way .",
    "gk  per is also atypical due to its long ( 2-day ) orbital period , meaning the system contains a much larger disc than most cvs .",
    "warner ( 1995 ) gives the outer disc radius as    @xmath6    which for gk per evaluates to @xmath7 cm , assuming the masses of the white dwarf and secondary to be 0.87  and 0.48  respectively ( morales - rueda 2002 ) .",
    "the viscous timescale of the disc will thus also be much longer than is typical for cvs .",
    "the viscous timescale at radius @xmath8 is given by    @xmath9    where @xmath4 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter ( @xmath40.1 during outburst and at least a factor of 10 lower in quiescence ) , @xmath10 is the sound speed in the disc , ( @xmath11 cm s@xmath1 ) and @xmath12 is the scale height of the disc ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the cold - state ( i.e. quiescent ) viscous timescale at the outer edge of the disc is thus @xmath144600 days , which is longer than the typical inter - outburst time of 1100 days .",
    "we also note that this timescale is only a factor 3 different from the delay between the 1967 outburst and the 2006 outburst , i.e.  the large disc is capable of producing variations on the approximate timescale on which the outburst morphology is showing variation .",
    "a typical outburst lasts 70 days ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluence ] ) . interpreting this as a viscous decay timescale",
    ", inverting equation  ( [ eq : tvisc ] ) shows that such outbursts extend to a disc radius @xmath83@xmath15 cm , i.e. about 10%  of the disc ( by radius ) is involved in a typical outburst .",
    "the above numbers demonstrate that the disc in gk per can retain a ` memory ' of its state which is not erased either by outbursts or during the quiescent inter - outburst period .",
    "this is because the cold - state viscous timescale is longer than the inter - outburst interval for a significant fraction of the disc .",
    "thus if there were , for example , long - term variations in the mass transfer rate from the secondary ( e.g.caused by magnetic activity on the star ) , these would be reflected in the disc density profile for many years .",
    "further , the disc configuration before and after any given outburst will vary .",
    "the fact that the 2006 outburst was different from previous events is thus not surprising : it is entirely possible that long term changes in the mass transfer rate are embedded in the disc density profile and hence outburst light curves .",
    "that many outbursts are similar to each other ( and even the 2006 outburst follows a ` typical ' outburst pattern for the first 1015 days ) is still consistent with this idea : the outburst is triggered when the surface density somewhere in the disc reaches the ( radius - dependent ) critical value .",
    "if each outburst begins at around the same place then by definition the disc state at this point must be approximately the same at the start of each outburst , hence the outbursts will appear similar at early times . as the heating wave propagates outwards to radii where the disc state can differ from outburst to outburst it becomes possible to observe variation in the outburst profile .    in general terms",
    ", this idea allows for long - term variations in the outburst profile , we consider now the detailed shape of the 2006 outburst and how this can be explained .",
    "the shape of the optical and uv outburst light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst ] ) is suggestive of 3 short , faint outbursts running into each other ( each reminiscent of the 1970 outburst , for example ) .",
    "a possible interpretation is thus that a series of heating and cooling waves passed through the disc giving a mini - outburst which is twice rekindled . this could be achieved if the heating wave is triggered at the inner disc but encounters a lower - density which halts its progress . at this point , as is usual for the end out dn outbursts , a cooling wave is launched ( lasota 2001 ) .",
    "this wave travels inwards , reducing the amount of the disc which is in the hot state .",
    "however this short time is less than the viscous timescale at the outburst triggering radius , so the outburst in the inner regions of the disc is not extinguished .",
    "the cooling wave is reflected back as a heating wave and the outburst is rekindled .",
    "we suggest that this sequence of events happens twice , giving rise to the triple - peaked optical / uv outburst profile .",
    "if this idea is correct , i.e  the outburst profile is determined by the disc density structure , then the similarity between the 1967 and 2006 outbursts suggests that the next outburst will be shorter and less luminous than normal , akin to the 1970 outburst .",
    "the origin of the x - ray spin - period pulsations in gk per was discussed extensively by hellier ( 2004 ) and vrielmann ( 2005 ) .",
    "they proposed that the modulation is caused by varying absorption as the ` accretion curtains ' of magnetically confined material pass through our line - of - sight to the emitting regions , although the specific geometric details differ between those two papers .",
    "if this is correct we would expect the hardness ratio to show a maximum of hardness at spin minimum ( i.e.  when absorption is at its greatest ) .",
    "[ fig : spin ] and  [ fig : hardspin ] appear to support this , although the errors on the hardness ratio are too large to make a definitive statement .",
    "the  spin - pulse profile and hardness ratio from the 2002 outburst ( evans &  hellier 2005 ) however shows this correlation clearly .",
    "the phasing and shape of the x - ray ( and uv ) spin - period modulation varies during the outburst ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] ) .",
    "norton ( 1988 ) reported a similar effect in quiescent x - ray data .",
    "they noted that in quiescence the accretion rate is barely enough to overcome the magnetospheric boundary and produce stable accretion , so the accretion may be time - dependent and thus the accretion geometry will be variable , explaining the changing pulse profiles .",
    "clearly in outburst the accretion rate is much higher and away from this limit , however the multi - wavelength light curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : outburst ] ) show a significant amount of variability from observation to observation , suggesting that the accretion rate is not stable .",
    "this in turn means that the disc ",
    "magnetosphere interaction region will be constantly changing , thus an unvarying spin - pulse profile is not expected .",
    "we have presented a unique , multi - wavelength , high - cadence dataset monitoring the evolution of the 2006 outburst of gk per at optical , uv and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the optical outburst profile is unusual , showing three weak peaks , rather than the typical single , bright peak ; it is also 30%  longer than a typical outburst .",
    "the uv data follow the optical evolution .",
    "the x - ray data , in contrast , appear entirely consistent with previous outbursts .",
    "this presents a significant challenge to existing disc outburst models .",
    "we have shown that the large disc in gk  per is able to maintain a long - term ` memory ' of its state ( and hence the mass transfer rate from the secondary ) which is not erased by outbursts or by quiescent accretion during the inter - outburst period .",
    "this is expected to produce long - term variation in outburst morphology . within this context",
    "we interpret the 2006 outburst as a short outburst which is thrice suppressed by low density regions of the disc , and twice rekindled by the high density inner regions .",
    "we also suggest that the next outburst , expected around 20092010 , will be shorted than normal , similar to the 1970 outburst .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the variable star observations from the aavso international database contributed by observers worldwide and used in this research .",
    "we thank the  pi , neil gehrels , and the science planners for supporting the too observations . this work made use of data supplied by the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester .",
