    "in the past decade , distributed cooperative control for multi - agent systems , particularly the consensus problem , has gained much attention and significant progress has been achieved , e.g. , @xcite@xcite .",
    "almost all studies assume that the information can be continuously transmitted between agents with infinite precision . in practice , such an idealized assumption is often unrealistic , so information transmission should to be considered in the analysis and design of consensus protocols @xcite .",
    "there are two main approaches to handle the communication limitation : event - triggered and quantized control . in",
    "event - triggered ( and self - triggered ) control the control input is piecewise constant and transmission happens at discrete events @xcite@xcite . for instance , @xcite provided event - triggered and self - triggered protocols in both centralized and distributed formulations for multi - agent systems with undirected graph topology ; @xcite proposed a self - triggered protocol for multi - agent systems with switching topologies .",
    "other authors considered systems with quantized sensor measurements and control inputs @xcite@xcite .",
    "the authors of the papers @xcite@xcite combined event - triggered control with quantized communication . for example , @xcite considered model - based event - triggered control for systems with quantization and time - varying network delays ; @xcite presented decentralised event - triggered control in multi - agent systems with quantized communication .    when considering event - triggered control in multi - agent systems with quantized communication or sensing , some aspects should be paid special attention to .",
    "firstly , the notion of the solution should be clarified since in some cases the classic or hybrid solutions may not exist .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite used the concept of filippov solution when they considered quantized sensing .",
    "secondly , the zeno behavior must be excluded @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the need of continuous state access for neighbors should be avoided . in @xcite , which is a key motivation for the present paper",
    ", the authors did not explicitly discuss the first aspect and used periodic sampling to exclude the zeno behavior .",
    "they did not give any accurate upper bound of the sampling time , which restricts the application of the results .",
    "inspired by @xcite and @xcite , we propose centralized and distributed self - triggered rules for multi - agent systems with quantized communication or sensing . under these rules ,",
    "the existence of a unique trajectory of the system is guaranteed and the frequency of communication and system updating is reduced .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is to show that the trajectory exponentially converges to practical consensus set .",
    "it is shown that continuously monitoring of the triggering condition can also be avoided .",
    "an important aspect of this paper is that the weakest fixed interaction topology is considered , namely , a directed graph containing a spanning tree .",
    "the proposed self - triggered rules are easy to implement in the sense that triggering times of each agent are only related to its in - degree .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] introduces the preliminaries ; section [ sec3 ] discusses self - triggered consensus with quantized communication ; section [ sec4 ] treats instead self - triggered consensus with quantized sensing ; simulations are given in section [ sec5 ] ; and the paper is concluded in section [ sec6 ] .",
