    "in a previous series of investigations @xcite , the clustering properties of  and  absorbers have been investigated , using an extensive catalog of heavy  element absorption  line systems drawn from the literature .",
    "these authors used a one  dimensional correlation analysis  one confined to pairs of absorbers along the _ same _ qso line of sight  and found evidence for strong and evolving clustering on small scales ( 116 ) , as well as for superclustering on scales as large as 50100 .",
    "together , these investigations suggest that these strong absorbers , with median rest equivalent width @xmath3   for @xcite , are biased tracers of the higher density regions of space , and that agglomerations of absorbers along a line of sight are indicators of clusters and superclusters .",
    "recently , @xcite used a new measure of clustering , called the reduced second moment measure or @xmath4 @xcite , which directly measures the mean overdensity of absorbers on scales @xmath5 . while closely related to other second  order measures of clustering , such as the correlation function or the power spectrum , the reduced second moment measure nevertheless has a number of advantageous statistical properties , and has recently been studied by astrophysicists @xcite .",
    "@xcite found significant evidence for clustering of absorbers on scales of 20100 , with marginal evidence on 100200  scales , again suggesting that the absorbers show superclustering much like what is seen locally in the distribution of galaxies .",
    "however , their analysis also was confined to pairs of absorbers along the same line of sight , and hence did not include _",
    "cross_line  of  sight information valuable for a full determination of the three  dimensional clustering properties of absorbers , which we are ultimately interested in finding .",
    "indeed , @xcite have claimed that there is evidence of some significant contamination of true intervening systems along the line of sight by absorbers that are actually physically associated with the qso , and that such contamination may extend to relative velocities as great as 75000 .",
    "this means that such a contamination could be present as well in the superclustering signal found by @xcite .",
    "in addition , on smaller scales of a few megaparsecs , @xcite have claimed that the clustering of  systems _ across _ adjacent lines of sight is significantly weaker than _ along _ a line of sight and have questioned whether the correlations are due to velocity dispersion in associated systems rather than intrinsic spatial clustering .",
    "the number of adjacent lines analyzed by @xcite was small , however .",
    "it is thus essential to study correlations both _ along _ and _ across _ qso lines of sight , to enable a complete determination of the three  dimensional clustering of absorbers , as well as a comparison of line and cross  line  of  sight clustering properties ( and ultimately statistically discriminate between intrinsic and intervening absorbers ) .",
    "what is required is a method that measures spatial clustering of absorbers  which are nonetheless confined to qso lines of sight  and can contrast clustering along and across lines of sight .    here",
    "we present the three  dimensional estimator for the reduced second moment measure of a three  dimensional point process probed by one  dimensional lines of sight .",
    "we apply our algorithm to a sample of 345  absorbers with median redshift @xmath0 , drawn from the spectra of 276 qsos in the aforementioned catalog of vanden berk , with the goal of determining the clustering of absorbers on very large scales and seeing if the signal found by @xcite remains when including cross  line  of  sight information , or , more compellingly , using only cross  line  of  sight information .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  2 we define the three  dimensional reduced second moment measure , compare it to its one  dimensional analog , and outline our method of estimation . in ",
    "3 we apply our methodology to the above sample and present our results . in ",
    "4 we interpret the results and discuss how the full three  dimensional estimator and cross  line  of  sight information will improve our ability to measure clustering with the absorber sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( 100,000 qsos ) .",
    "finally , we conclude in  5 and present the details of the three  dimensional reduced second moment estimator in the appendix .",
    "here we assume that the clustering of absorbers is both statistically homogeneous and stationary ( does not depend on cosmic epoch or redshift @xmath6 ) when examined in comoving coordinates .",
    "the latter assumption is likely not to be strictly true , since growth of the correlation function with decreasing redshift has been detected , at least on smaller scales of 116 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our results here can be thought of as averages for the absorber sample as a whole , which has a characteristic redshift given by the median @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible to extend our treatment and examine the evolution of the clustering with redshift ( see  4 below regarding the sloan digital sky survey ) , but we have not done so here , largely because of the limited size of our sample .",
    "we follow the usual convention and take the hubble constant , @xmath7 , to be 100  @xmath8  mpc@xmath9 and take @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we treat the distribution of absorbers as a point process in _ three_dimensional space rather than as a",
    "_ one_dimensional process on the lines of sight , and use the reduced second moment to describe the three  dimensional clustering . otherwise , we closely follow the treatment given in @xcite  where one  dimensional clustering is described  and use the same symbol @xmath12 for the three  dimensional reduced second moment .",
    "let @xmath13 be the mean number of absorbers per unit comoving volume .",
    "the absorbers have some physical size , perhaps of order 100 kpc or so @xcite , so that there is a finite probability of intersection between an absorber and the qso lines of sight . for simplicity , we assume the absorbers are balls of identical radius @xmath14 .",
    "our treatment is accurate on scales of a few mpc and greater , which are much larger than the physical size of the absorbers .",
    "the clustering we seek to measure is that of the _ centers _ of the absorbers .",
    "neither our methods nor results depend on specifying @xmath14 ( see appendix ) .",
    "since absorbers do vary in size , mass and column density , and their clustering likely depends on these quantities @xcite , our results can not be directly interpreted as a quantitative measure of the clustering of mass .",
    "nevertheless , we expect our results to be qualitatively correct to the extent that if our estimates of @xmath12 show evidence of clustering on some spatial scale , matter should also show clustering on this same scale , especially if the latter is quite large .",
    "furthermore , our results are neither more nor less dependent on the assumption of equal absorber size as those in the one  dimensional analyses presented in @xcite or @xcite ; rather , it is just harder to ignore the fact that absorbers must have a finite cross section and volume when doing a three  dimensional analysis based on intersections of absorbers with lines of sight .    the _ reduced second moment measure _ ,",
    "@xmath4 , is the conditional expectation , or average  given that there is an absorber center at @xmath15  of the number of absorbers ( other than the one at @xmath15 itself ) , @xmath16 , whose centers are within a comoving distance @xmath17 of @xmath15 , normalized by @xmath13 : @xmath18 \\ ;   .\\ ] ] because of our assumption of homogeneity , the expected number of absorbers in equation  ( 1 ) does not depend on @xmath15 . with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the comoving distance @xmath17 between two absorbers at redshifts @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 is @xmath21 .    in terms of the two  point correlation function",
    "@xmath22 @xcite , the reduced second moment measure is given by @xmath23\\ ; .\\ ] ] if no correlations are present , then @xmath24 .",
    "simply put , in this case the number of surrounding absorber centers within distance @xmath17 of @xmath15 would not depend on the fact that there is an absorber center at @xmath15 , and would simply be equal to @xmath25 . the quantity @xmath26 is then a measure of the relative mean density of absorbers around other absorbers , averaged over scales less than @xmath17 .",
    "thus the reduced second moment measure is essentially a volume  weighted integral of the correlation function , whereas in the one  dimensional treatment of @xcite it is a distance  weighted integral . even if one does not use across  line  of  sight information , it is arguably more natural to study the three - dimensional reduced second moment measure .",
    "the relative mean _ over  density _ ,",
    "@xmath27 , can be written in terms of the power spectrum , @xmath28 , the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath22 , or equivalently , in terms of the dimensionless power per logarithmic wavenumber , @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the window function for a top hat ( hard sphere ) .",
    "thus the reduced second moment measure , @xmath4 , is closely related to other second  order measures such as the correlation function or the power spectrum , and it directly measures the mean over  density of absorbers on scales less than @xmath17 .",
    "however , it has a number of distinct and desirable statistical properties which have been presented and discussed elsewhere @xcite .      here",
    "we outline our method of estimating @xmath12 , taking into account all absorber pairs , deferring the complete derivation of the estimators to the appendix .",
    "we construct two estimators for @xmath4 , the first , @xmath32 ( eq . [ a7 ] ) , using only absorber pairs on the same line of sight , and the second , @xmath33 ( eq . [ a13 ] ) , using only absorber pairs from different qso lines of sight .",
    "of each other , and since @xmath4 is a measure of integrated correlation , it is not possible to compute @xmath34 directly , using only across  line  of  sight information .",
    "however , we can sensibly consider @xmath35 for @xmath17 greater than the minimum distance @xmath36 between lines of sight ( see appendix ) . ]",
    "both of these are estimators for the same reduced second moment measure @xmath4 defined in equation  ( 1 ) ; to the extent that these estimators agree , they provide evidence that any clustering found is not due to absorbers associated with the qsos ( see  1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we can combine the along and across  line  of  sight information to obtain an overall estimator @xmath37 ( eq .  [ a14 ] ) , which should be more accurate than either @xmath32 or @xmath33 , since we use all of the available information .    in order to estimate @xmath4 defined in equation  ( 1 )",
    ", one needs to estimate the average number of neighbors within a distance @xmath17 of a typical absorber . to understand the problems associated with estimating this quantity , it is helpful to consider the simpler setting of observing a point process in a single contiguous region of space .",
    "one possible way to estimate @xmath4 for a point process observed in a window ( or sample region ) @xmath38 with volume @xmath39 is , for each point in @xmath38 , count how many other points in @xmath38 are within @xmath17 of it , sum these counts and then divide by an appropriate quantity that cancels out the effect of the overall intensity of the process .",
    "@xcite calls such an estimator the `` naive '' estimator .",
    "the problem with this estimator is that it tends to underestimate @xmath4 because for a point within distance @xmath17 of a boundary of @xmath38 , one may not see all of the points of the process that are within @xmath17 of it ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "there are a number of methods of correcting for this `` edge effect''@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the isotropic correction @xcite , which is computationally well  suited to the setting of a process observed along lines of sight . to describe this correction , consider the two  dimensional setting pictured in figure  1 . for a point at @xmath40 , if another point @xmath41 is within distance @xmath17 of @xmath15 , then instead of giving this event a weight of 1 as in the naive estimator , it is given weight @xmath42 equal to the reciprocal of the fraction @xmath43 of the circle of radius @xmath44 that is contained within @xmath38 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "as with all of the various edge  correction methods , we then have @xmath45=\\lambda^2 a k(r ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the indicator function , which is unity if the condition in brackets is true and zero otherwise .",
    "to estimate @xmath4 , we divide this sum by some estimate of @xmath47 . denoting by @xmath48 the total number of points observed in @xmath38",
    ", we will use @xmath49 as our estimator of @xmath47 .    even recognizing that absorbers have a finite volume",
    ", we get to observe absorbers in almost _",
    "none _ of the ball of radius @xmath17 around any absorber , when estimating the three  dimensional @xmath12 function . thus , whereas with observations in a single contiguous region , @xmath42 often equals 1 ( i.e. , when @xmath15 is not within @xmath44 of the boundary of @xmath38 ) , for an absorber catalog observed along lines of sight , @xmath42 will always be much bigger than 1 .",
    "the exact form of the weight function is given in the appendix .",
    "as one should expect , the weight is inversely proportional to the cross section of the absorbers , or equivalently , to @xmath50 .",
    "fortunately , our estimator for @xmath51 will also be inversely proportional to @xmath50 , so the factor of @xmath50 cancels when estimating @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite used what is known as the rigid  motion estimator to correct for edge effects when estimating the one  dimensional reduced second moment function . to apply the rigid  motion method to an estimate that uses across  line  of  sight information , for every observed distance between pairs of absorbers less than the maximum distance at which we wish to estimate @xmath12",
    ", we would have to apply a three  dimensional rigid motion to the lines of sight , calculate the amount of overlap between the old and new set of lines , and then average this amount over all possible directions .",
    "it is not clear how one could do this accurately in practice .",
    "since we have no evidence regarding which estimator is statistically superior in the present setting , we use the computationally much simpler isotropic estimator .",
    "we have used equation  ( a7 ) and equation  ( a14 ) to estimate the reduced second moment measure , @xmath4 , for 276 qso lines of sight , obtained from the vanden berk  catalog .",
    "a total of 345 absorbers have been selected from this heterogeneous catalog , using selection criteria @xcite designed to obtain as homogeneous a data set as possible .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for a detailed description of the selection criteria .",
    "figure  2 shows both @xmath32 ( _ dashed line _ ) and @xmath52 ( _ solid line _ ) , divided by their poisson expectation value , @xmath53 , for the entire  absorber catalog .",
    "these resultant quantities have expectation value of very nearly unity if there is no clustering of absorbers ( see the appendix ) .",
    "figure  2 shows that the two estimates agree very well ( within their estimated errors , see below ) over all distances @xmath17 from 5 to 300 , with @xmath32 just slightly larger than @xmath52 between 30 and 140 .",
    "note that , along the same line of sight , the number of absorber pairs separated by very large distances is small , because of the finite comoving length of the lines of sight ( the median length is 350  [ quashnock & stein 1999 ] ) ; thus , in figure  2 , for distances @xmath17 of 170  and greater ,",
    "@xmath32 is noticeably less smooth than @xmath52 . examination of the numbers of absorber pairs along and across lines of sight indicates that it is at such distances that the _ across _ line of sight information dominates the total information available . in table  1",
    ", we show the number of absorber pairs in the data set , for pairs along and across lines of sight , as a function of pair separation @xmath17 , in 10  bins .",
    "we also show the cumulative number of pairs for separations @xmath54 . for pair separations",
    "@xmath55 , there are more additional absorber pairs across different lines of sight than along the same line of sight , whereas for pair separations @xmath56 , the opposite is true .",
    "these two numbers delineate the regimes where , in the vanden berk  catalog , clustering information arises primarily from pairs across and along lines of sight , respectively .",
    "in particular , table  1 shows that the sample is too sparse to significantly compare clustering along and across lines of sight on scales of less than 100 .    if the centers of absorbers form a homogeneous poisson process in three dimensions , i.e. , if they are unclustered , then their intersections with the lines of sight form independent one  dimensional poisson processes , provided their size @xmath14 is sufficiently small compared to the scales of interest ( see appendix ) .",
    "thus it is straightforward to simulate the distribution of @xmath32 and @xmath52 under the assumption that the  absorbers are unclustered .    in figure  3 , we show the 95% region of variation about the expectation value of unity of , respectively , @xmath32 ( _ dashed line _ ) and @xmath52 ( _ solid line _ ) , divided by their poisson expectation value , @xmath53 , for 10,000 simulated data sets of unclustered absorbers with the same arrangement of lines and average number of absorbers as the vanden berk  catalog .",
    "their averages ( _ dotted lines _ ) are very near the true value of unity , indicating that both estimators are very nearly unbiased in this case .",
    "we find that the two estimators have essentially the same region of variation on scales up to @xmath57 ; beyond that , the range is smaller for @xmath52 , reflecting the additional information contributed by pairs of absorbers across different lines of sight .    to properly interpret the results in figure 2",
    ", one needs some measure of the uncertanties in the estimates .",
    "@xcite obtained approximate confidence intervals by bootstrapping , or resampling , lines of sight .",
    "such a procedure makes no use of the relative locations of the lines of sight and is nonsensical when applied to an estimator using across  line  of  sight information .",
    "a bootstrapping procedure based on resampling regions of the sky would be more appropriate in the present setting , but the problems of handling edge effects and the uneven spatial distribution of lines of sight complicate matters , so it is unclear how well such a procedure would work .    to provide a rough idea as to the uncertainty of our estimators of @xmath4",
    ", we use a crude but simple approach .",
    "we divide the sky into eight regions , each containing nearly the same total length of lines of sight .",
    "we then compute the sample standard deviation of the eight estimators of @xmath4 in the eight regions , assume that the standard deviation @xmath58 for the estimator based on all of the data will be smaller by a factor of @xmath59 and then use the overall estimate plus or minus @xmath60 as our confidence interval .",
    "it is clear that figure  2 shows strong evidence of clustering on scales up to 100  ( @xmath1 ) , and possibly beyond . in addition ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath37 essentially agree on the magnitude of the reduced second moment measure up to this distance .",
    "this is to be expected , since , as is clear from table  1 , there are very few additional pairs of absorbers coming from different lines of sight on these scales .",
    "thus , the sample is too sparse to significantly compare clustering along and across lines of sight on scales of less than 100 .    on scales greater than 100",
    ", however , there are significantly more additional pairs of absorbers from different lines of sight , and it becomes possible to compare their clustering along and across lines of sight . since @xmath4 is an _ integrated _ measure of clustering on scales from zero to @xmath17 , it is necessary to look at estimates of _ differential _ quantities like @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 ) in order to examine clustering on scales strictly _ between _ @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we have investigated the significance of clustering scales greater than 100 by examining the quantity @xmath66 the quantity @xmath67 is the estimated average volume  weighted correlation function on scales between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "if the latter two are reasonably close to each other , then @xmath67 is an approximate measure of the correlation function @xmath22 on the average scale @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , we define the quantities @xmath69 and @xmath70 by replacing @xmath71 in equation  ( 5 ) above by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "these two quantities are estimates of the average volume  weighted correlation function that use only along or cross  line  of  sight information , respectively .",
    "we have examined clustering on scales @xmath17 greater than 100  by computing @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for a sliding window that is 50  wide and centered on @xmath17 .",
    "figure 4 ( _ solid lines _ ) shows all three quantities , @xmath77 ( _ top panel _ ) , @xmath78 ( _ middle panel _ ) , and @xmath79 ( _ lower panel _ ) , for scales @xmath17 between 100  and 300 .",
    "their approximate 95% regions of variation ( again estimated by dividing the qso sample into eight subsamples corresponding to eight different regions of the sky ) are also shown ( _ dashed lines _ ) .",
    "all three curves are quite similar , showing evidence of clustering on scales @xmath17 between 100  and 150 , and all agree with each other within their approximate confidence regions .",
    "what is particularly striking , however , is that @xmath76 ( computed with pairs coming from different lines of sight ) essentially agrees within the errors with @xmath75 ( computed with pairs coming from the same line of sight ) ; thus , the additional _ cross_line  of  sight information _ strengthens _ the evidence for clustering on scales from 100  to 150 .",
    "although the evidence for clustering across lines of sight is , on its own , only marginally significant , it is consistent with the amplitude and scale of clustering of absorbers along lines of sight ; indeed , if anything it hints at being even _ stronger _ on these scales .",
    "such clustering on 100  to 150  scales had been hinted at in the one  dimensional work of @xcite , and has been confirmed by the three - dimensional analysis here .",
    "this argues against claims that all of the apparent line  of  sight clustering on these scales is due to significant contamination along the line of sight by absorbers that are actually physically associated with the qso ( see  1 ) .",
    "figure  4 shows no evidence on clustering on scales between 150  and 300 , using any of the three estimators ; on scales greater than 150 , the absorbers appear to be distributed in a manner that is consistent with isotropy .",
    "note that beyond 200 , @xmath74 has appreciably smaller estimated variability than @xmath75 ; this shows how using the full three  dimensional estimator @xmath37 can improve the measurement of clustering on very large scales , even for this modest ",
    "sized catalog .",
    "of course , the lines of sight in the vanden berk et al .",
    "absorber catalog are rather sparse , and there are still only 345 lines that were analyzed here .",
    "the limited size of that catalog , as well as its heterogeneity , precludes a final , strong statement of the statistical significance and amplitude of the clustering on scales between 100  and 150 .",
    "as soon as data are available , we will undertake a new effort at analyzing the clustering of heavy  element absorbers in the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter sdss ) , now underway @xcite .",
    "the sdss qso absorption  line catalog ( hereafter the sdss catalog ) will include heavy  element absorption  line systems found in the spectra of about 100,000 qsos , with absorbers ranging in redshift from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "the sdss catalog will be of order 300 times larger than the vanden berk catalog ; furthermore , it will be a homogeneous catalog with fixed selection and detection criteria for the entire sample .",
    "also , the density ( number of qsos per solid angle on the sky ) of probing lines of sight will be of order 300 times higher .    because the sdss catalog will have much greater density of lines of sight than the catalog analyzed here",
    ", we should expect a much larger fraction of the information about clustering of absorbers from pairs across different lines of sight .",
    "using simulations , we have estimated how much smaller the standard errors of the estimators will be in the 300times _ larger _ sdss catalog ; in particular , we have investigated how the standard errors will be reduced by using the full three  dimensional estimator and all the cross  line  of  sight information in the 300times _ denser _ sdss catalog .",
    "to do this , we have made simulations of randomly placed absorbers and examined how the standard errors of the estimators change if the lines of sight are present at an intensity comparable to that which will be achieved in the sdss catalog .",
    "we define a region of space similar to that to be probed by the qso lines of sight of the sdss catalog : that section of a cone with half  angle of @xmath82 and earth at its tip , which is bounded by comoving distance @xmath83  ( corresponding to redshift @xmath84 ) from earth .",
    "lines of sight are placed randomly in this region of space , with a uniform distribution of comoving lengths between 250 and 450  similar to that in the vanden berk  catalog @xcite .",
    "mock catalogs were created , with total number , @xmath85 , of lines of sight equal to 100 , 1000 , 10,000 and 100,000 , and absorbers randomly placed on all these lines with the same average number of absorbers per unit comoving length as that observed in the vanden berk  catalog .",
    "the catalogs were generated by simulating a one  dimensional poisson process on the lines of sight .",
    "a set of 10,000 of these unclustered mock catalogs were made for each @xmath85 except for @xmath86 , for which 100 mock catalogs were made .",
    "the variances of the reduced second moment estimators @xmath32 and @xmath52 ( the average , or expectation value , is , in all cases , very near the true value of @xmath87 ) were computed for each @xmath85 , for @xmath88 .",
    "we find , not surprisingly , that the standard error of @xmath32 decreases with the total number of lines @xmath85 as @xmath89 ; however , this reduction in standard error is _ constant _ over @xmath17 . for @xmath52 , there is an additional reduction for larger @xmath17 . in figure  5",
    ", we show the ratio of the standard error of @xmath52 for @xmath90 1000 ( _ short - dashed line _ ) , 10,000 ( _ long - dashed line _ ) , and 100,000 ( _ solid line _ ) , to that of @xmath52 for @xmath90 100 .",
    "as the number of lines of sight increases , there is a continued reduction in the standard error for larger distances , due to the additional and relatively more important number of absorber pairs from across _ different _ lines of sight .",
    "this is displayed more dramatically in figure  6 , where we show the relative improvement , or ratio , of the standard errors of @xmath52 to @xmath32 for @xmath90 100 ( _ dotted line _ ) , 1000 ( _ short - dashed line _ ) , 10,000 ( _ long - dashed line _ ) , and 100,000 ( _ solid line _ ) . with 100,000 lines of sight , using @xmath52 instead of @xmath32 results in an additional factor of 2 to 20 reduction of the standard error on scales of 30 to 200 , _",
    "in addition _ to the factor of @xmath2 reduction from the larger sample size , effectively increasing the sample size by an extra factor of 4 to 400 at large distances .",
    "it is the line density ( number of lines of sight per solid angle on the sky , or the number of qsos per square degree ) that determines the _ relative _ efficiency of @xmath52 to @xmath32 , not the total number of lines @xmath85 .",
    "this is also shown in figure  6 , where we show the ratio of the standard errors of @xmath52 to @xmath32 , this time for @xmath90 100 lines of sight , but where the angular density of lines is 10 times ( _ short - dashed and dotted line _ ) and 100 times ( _ long - dashed and dotted line _ )",
    "higher than the initial density ; i.e. , the solid angle of the conic region described above is 10 and 100 times smaller , respectively .",
    "figure  6 shows that increasing the density of lines by a given factor has the same effect on the relative efficiency of @xmath52 to @xmath32 as does simply increasing the total number of lines of sight by that same factor .",
    "of course , the overall size of the standard errors is governed by the total number of lines @xmath85 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "these comparisons of the errors in @xmath52 and @xmath32 are based on unclustered mock catalogs .",
    "we are investigating , in ongoing simulations , how different the actual relative improvement might be in a catalog of clustered absorbers such as the sdss catalog . using a simple model of voids and clusters @xcite that mimics the correlation structure of the vanden berk et al .",
    "catalog , we have made 1000 clustered mock catalogs with 100 and 1000 lines of sight .",
    "we find , for example , that for @xmath91 300 , the ratio of the standard errors of @xmath52 to @xmath32 is 0.629 and 0.230 for unclustered catalogs with 100 and 1000 lines of sight , respectively ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , and 0.669 and 0.270 for clustered catalogs with the same numbers of lines .",
    "this indicates that the relative improvement that arises from using cross  line  of  sight pairs in clustered catalogs is still dramatic and is only slightly less so ( 6% and 17% change in the above two cases ) than for unclustered catalogs .",
    "thus , we expect use of the full three  dimensional estimator to substantially increase clustering sensitivity in the sdss catalog , with a relative improvement that is only slightly less dramatic than what is shown in figure 6 ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "we hope to present more detailed results elsewhere , with much larger numbers of lines of sight @xcite .",
    "we present two estimators , @xmath32 and @xmath52 , for the three  dimensional reduced second moment for one  dimensional data ( absorber redshifts ) along qso lines of sight .",
    "the first estimator uses absorber pairs along the _ same _ lines of sight , whereas the latter includes data from across _ different _ lines of sight .",
    "we apply our algorithm to a sample of 345  absorbers with median redshift @xmath0 , from the spectra of 276 qsos , drawn from the catalog of vanden berk .",
    "we confirm the existence of significant clustering of  absorbers on comoving scales up to 100  ( @xmath1 ) , and find that the additional _ cross_line  of  sight information strengthens the evidence for clustering on scales from 100  to 150 .",
    "this argues against claims that all the apparent clustering on these scales is due to significant contamination along the line of sight by absorbers that are actually physically associated with the qso .",
    "however , the limited size of that catalog , as well as its heterogeneity , precludes a final , strong statement of the statistical significance and amplitude of the clustering on scales @xmath92 .",
    "also , the sample is too sparse to significantly compare clustering along and across lines of sight on scales of less than 100 . there is no evidence of absorber clustering along or across lines of sight for scales from 150  to 300 .",
    "we show that with a 300times larger catalog , such as that to be compiled by the sloan digital sky survey ( 100,000 qsos ) , use of the full three  dimensional estimator and cross  line  of  sight information will _ substantially _ increase clustering sensitivity .",
    "we find that standard errors are reduced by a factor 2 to 20 on scales of 30 to 200 , _ in addition _ to the factor of @xmath2 reduction from the larger sample size , effectively increasing the sample size by an extra factor of 4 to 400 at large distances .",
