    "the recent results from the neutrino oscillation experiments convincingly show that neutrinos have a finite mass .",
    "however , in such experiments only the squares of the neutrino masses differences can be measured , and only a lower limit on the absolute value of the neutrino mass scale has been obtained in this way . such a result is in turn causing a renewed interest in double beta decay experiments which are expected to reach , in the next future , a sensitivity corresponding to the mass scale indicated by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "is actually a very important process both from the particle and nuclear physics point of view , representing a unique tool to establish the absolute neutrino mass scale , its nature ( dirac / majorana ) and the values of the majorana cp phases .",
    "it can proceed in fact only if neutrinos are majorana massive particles .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainties in the transition nuclear matrix elements still affect the interpretation of the experimental results and new efforts to overcome such a problem are strongly required ( new theoretical calculations and experimental analyses of different active isotopes ) .",
    "complementary informations from beta experiments and astrophysics are of course welcomed .",
    "+ present , and near future experiments have reached a sensitivity to span the region 0.1 - 1 ev .",
    "different plans to overcome the challenge implied by the achievement of the sensitivity required to reach the 10 - 50 mev region have been proposed .",
    "they will be reviewed in the section devoted to the future projects .",
    "several review articles covering both the experimental and the theoretical aspects and implications of have been recently issued @xcite .",
    "i will refer to them for more details on the subject .",
    "double beta decay is a rare spontaneous nuclear transition in which the charge of two isobaric nuclei changes by two units with the simultaneous emission of two electrons",
    ". the parent nucleus must be less bound than the daughter one , while it is generally required that both be more bound than the intermediate one , in order to avoid the equivalent sequence of two single beta decays ( fig.[fig : bbs ] ) .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled in nature for a number of even - even nuclei .",
    "the decay can then proceed both to the ground state or to the first excited states of the daughter nucleus .",
    "nuclear transitions accompanied by positron emission or electron capture processes are also possible .",
    "they are however characterized by poorer experimental sensitivities and will not be discussed in the following .",
    "several modes are possible .",
    "the most popular are the 2@xmath1 mode @xmath2 which conserves the lepton number and it is allowed in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) of electro - weak interactions , and the 0@xmath1 mode @xmath3 which violates the lepton number and has been recognized since a long time as a powerful tool to test neutrino properties@xcite . a third decay mode ( ) , in which one or more light neutral bosons @xmath4 ( majorons , whose existence is postulated by various sm extensions )",
    "are also emitted @xmath5 is often considered . in all envisaged modes , is a second order weak semileptonic transition , hence characterized by very long lifetimes . besides the exchange of light or heavy majorana neutrinos , can be mediated by the exchange of a variety of unconventional particles ( e.g. susy partners ) .",
    "its amplitude then depends on the mass and coupling constants of these virtual particles and results can be used to constrain model parameters .",
    "important constraints on left - right symmetric and supersymmetric models have thus been obtained using currently available results .",
    "+ independent of the actual mechanism mediating the decay , observation would necessarily imply that neutrinos are majorana massive particles",
    ". a lower limit on neutrino mass eigenstates could be then obtained .",
    "lacking however any evidence for experimental upper limits on the decay lifetimes can only be interpreted as independent limits on each of the possible contributions to the decay amplitude . disregarding more unconventional contributions ( susy or left - right symmetric models ) , the rate is usually expressed as @xmath6^{-1 } =   g^{0\\nu}|m^{0\\nu}|^2{\\langle m_{\\nu } \\rangle^2 } \\label{eq : rate0}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the ( exactly calculable ) phase space integral , @xmath8 is the nuclear matrix element and ( em effective neutrino mass ) is the neutrino relevant parameter measured in @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the left - handed unitary neutrino mixing matrix relating physical _ weak eigenstates _ to the mass eigenstates ( @xmath11 ) , while @xmath12 are the intrinsic cp parities of the neutrinos .",
    "summation is over light neutrinos only .",
    "the presence of the phases @xmath12 implies that cancellations are possible .",
    "such cancellations are complete for a dirac neutrino since it is equivalent to two degenerate majorana neutrinos with opposite cp phases .",
    "this stresses once more the fact that can occur only through the exchange of majorana neutrinos .",
    "+ from a particle physics point of view , represents a unique tool to measure the neutrino majorana phases and to assess the absolute scale of the neutrino masses .",
    "predictions on based on the most recent neutrino oscillation results have been derived by various authors  @xcite .",
    "the most striking aspect of such predictions is that , for the first time in the history of searches , a definite goal exists : an experimental sensitivity in the range 10 - 50 mev could definitely rule out inverse and quasi - degenerate hierarchies thus assessing a direct neutrino mass hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "observation at larger scales would be equally important but its occurrence is based on more optimistic assumptions ( e.g. a definite mass hierarchy ) . + as it is apparent from eq .",
    "[ eq : rate0 ] the derivation of the crucial parameter from the experimental results on lifetime requires a precise knowledge of the transition nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) . unfortunately this is not an easy job and a definite knowledge of nme values and uncertainties is still lacking in spite of the large attention attracted by this area of research .",
    "many , often conflicting evaluations are available in the literature and it is unfortunately not easy to judge their correctness or accuracy .",
    "outstanding progress has been achieved over the last years mainly due to the application of the qrpa method and its extensions .",
    "renewed interest in shell model calculations has been on the other hand boosted by the fast development of computer technologies .",
    "alternative approaches ( e.g. oem ) have also been pursued .",
    "comparison with experimental rates has often been suggested as a possible way out ( direct test of the calculation method ) .",
    "the evaluation methods for the two decay modes show however relevant differences ( e.g. the neutrino propagator ) and the effectiveness of such a comparison is still controversial .",
    "a popular even if doubtful attitude consists in considering the spread of the different evaluations as an estimate of their uncertainties .",
    "in such a way one obtains a spread of about one order of magnitude in the calculated half lifetimes ( tab .",
    "[ tab : nme ] ) , corresponding to a factor of  3 in .",
    "it is clear that a big improvement in the calculation of nme or at least in the estimate of their uncertainties would be welcomed .",
    "new calculation methods should be pursued while insisting on the comparison with dedicated measurements coming from various areas of nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , an experimental effort to investigate as many as possible emitters should be addressed .",
    ".theoretically evaluated  half - lives ( units of @xmath13 years for  = 10 mev ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     too many proposal have been recently suggested for a detailed description .",
    "we will therefore mention just few selected examples showing the main characteristics of the future challenge while giving just a very short description of the concept for the others . + both projects are large scale extensions of existing successfull experiments .",
    "genius@xcite ( germanium in liquid nitrogen underground setup ) will consist of an array of 400 isotopically enriched ( 86% in @xmath14ge ) ge diodes , with a total mass of 1 ton . evolved from the hm experiment , it will aim at a radical background suppression ( mainly due to environmental and setup radioactivity ) through the use of an unconventional `` cryostat '' : naked diodes will be suspended in the centre of a very large liquid nitrogen container , which will act also as a very effective shield .",
    "liquid nitrogen is in fact available at extremely good radiopurity levels and a reduction by a factor of 100 with respect to the hm background level is expected in the region .",
    "a problem could be represented by the huge dimensions ( 12 m diameter ) and security requirements ( it would operate underground ) .",
    "cost and availability of the enriched germanium are also important issues .",
    "the suggested extension to 10 tons , while maintaining the same level of background , would lead to a sensitivity about twice better .",
    "three small naked ge diodes were tested in a small ( 50 l ) ln cryostat for a short time , indicating a performance comparable to that in a conventional vacuum - tight cryostat . in order to test the feasibility of the project ( long time performance of naked ge diodes in ln and dark matter studies ) ,",
    "the authors have proposed the construction of a preliminary test facility ( genius - tf ) .",
    "already approved by the lngs scientific committee of the gran sasso laboratory , it will consist in 14 crystals of naked natural germanium diodes inside a small liquid nitrogen box . a standard shield",
    "( heavy layers of copper , low radioactivity lead and borated polyethylene ) will surround it .",
    "the genius - tf shield smallness will probably prevent any direct check of the genius background suppression concept , while its large detector mass will probably allow to investigate the dark matter annual modulation .",
    "+ majorana@xcite , which involves many of the igex collaborators , would also consist of an array of 210 isotopically enriched ge diodes for a total mass of 0.5 tons . as opposite to the genius design , the use of a very low activity conventional cryostat ( extremely radiopure electroformed cu ) able to host simultaneously a number of diodes is proposed .",
    "the compact set - up would be installed in the new underground laboratory being planned in the usa .",
    "the driving principle behind the project is a strong reduction of the background by the application of a very effective pulse - shape discrimination and the development of special segmented detectors .",
    "the authors believe in fact that main contributions to background be due to cosmogenically produced long - lived isotopes . after a number of preliminary tests , the authors are presently mounting a 12 sections segmented enriched crystal underground in order to test their background expectations .",
    "they are very concerned by the cost and by the time required for the production and delivery of the required large amount of enriched material .",
    "negotiation are in progress with russian enrichment institutes .",
    "the possibility to build a new dedicated enriching facility is under study .",
    "+ cuore@xcite ( _ cryogenic underground detector for rare events _ ) would be a very large extension of mibeta also installed in the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "cuore would consist in a rather compact structure made of 1000 cubic natural crystals of 5 cm side ( with a mass of 760 g ) , arranged into 25 separate _ towers _ ( 10 _ planes _ of 4 crystals each ) and operated at a temperature of  10 mk .",
    "the expected energy resolution is 5kev fwhm at the transition energy ( 2.528 mev ) .",
    "a background level lower by a factor of 100 with respect to the mibeta one , is expected by extrapolating mibeta background results to the cuore structure .",
    "a further improvement is expected on the ground of a better surface contribution suppression .",
    "would be its main investigation but dark matter searches are also foreseen ( annual modulation of the signal , axions from the sun , etc . ) .",
    "thanks to the bolometers versatility , alternative options with respect to could be taken into consideration .",
    "a smaller , but still sizeable , experiment named cuoricino ( _ small cuore _ in italian ) , has been already approved and funded and is presently being installed .",
    "it consists in a modified single tower of cuore made by 44 cuore crystals ( 11 _ planes _ ) plus 18 mibeta crystals ( 2 further _ planes _ ) . even if single cuore _",
    "planes _ have been already successfully tested ( energy resolutions of 1 kev at low energy and 3 - 6 kev in the region over running time of the order of months ) , cuoricino will be a crucial test of the cuore project feasibility ( technical performance and background level expectations ) .",
    "+ exo@xcite would be a large mass (  10 tons ) enriched xenon observatory aiming at a @xmath15xe search through an ingenuous tagging of the doubly charged ba isotope produced in the decay ( @xmath16 ) , which would allow an excellent background suppression .",
    "the concept of this unconventional proposal is the following : after reduction to ba@xmath17 ion , excitation from the initial @xmath18 state to the @xmath19 is obtained by means of a first 493 nm laser pulse .",
    "such a state would then decay with a 30% b.r . to the metastable @xmath20 state which can be re - excited to the @xmath19 by a second 650 nm laser beam .",
    "de - excitation to the original @xmath19 state would then be followed by the emission of a 493 nm photon .",
    "the technical feasibility of such an ambitious project aiming at a complete suppression of all the backgrounds requires a hard r&d phase .",
    "the unavoidable contribution is however a serious concern due to the poor energy resolution of xe detectors .",
    "two detector concepts have presently been considered : a high pressure gas tpc and a lxe chamber . in the gas tpc option",
    ", ba ions would remain for a reasonable time in the same position ( 0.7 mm / sec diffusion at 5 bars ) , allowing an effective tag (  100 laser cycles ) after their position would be measured in the tpc .",
    "the lxe option would have , on the other hand , the advantages of a more compact structure and of a better energy resolution ( scintillation readout ) but at the cost of an insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "ions transport into a spectroscopy chamber for a later analysis is under study .",
    "exo has been currently funded to develop a 100 kg enriched xe withouth ba tagging .",
    "+ based on a passive source approach the moon project@xcite plans to use natural molybdenum ( 9.63  % ) to detect not only but also solar neutrinos . to be installed in the oto laboratory ( japan )",
    ", it would consist in a gigantic sandwich ( m@xmath21=34 t ) made by sheets of natural molybdenum interleaved with specially designed scintillators . the possibility to use bolometeric detectors",
    "has also been considered .",
    "the cameo@xcite proposal would use 1 ton of scintillating @xmath22cdwo@xmath23 cristals inside the borexino detector .",
    "candles would be based instead on the use of caf@xmath24 in liquid scintillator .",
    "cobra@xcite would use cdte or cdznte diodes ( 10 kg ) to investigate cd and te isotopes in a calorimetric approach .",
    "gem@xcite is a proposal very similar to genius in which the complex ln huge cryostat has been replaced by a definitely smaller one inserted in a large pure water container ( e.g. borexino ) .",
    "dcba@xcite proposes the use of a modular 3-d tracking ( drift chamber ) in a uniform magnetic field to study @xmath25nd ; the expected sensitivity based on the analysis of the single electron energy distributions seems unfortunately untenable .",
    "an interesting sensitivity have been claimed also by the xmass@xcite solar neutrino collaboraion .",
    "a renewed interest in has been stimulated by recent neutrino oscillation results .",
    "neutrinoless is finally recognized as a unique tool to measure neutrino properties ( nature , mass scale , intrinsic phases ) unavailable to the successful experiments on neutrino oscillations .",
    "present limits on are still outside the range predicted on the basis of the latest neutrino oscillation results .",
    "however the situation could drastically change in the future .",
    "a number of newly proposed experiments could in fact reach this sensitivity .",
    "the attainability of such a goal strongly depends on the true capability of these projects to reach the required background levels in the region .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the ( sometimes optimistic ) background predictions of the various projects ( even if extrapolated from the results of lower scale successful experiments ) is therefore worthwhile and the construction of preliminary test setups is absolutely needed",
    ". these could be on the other hand experiments at an intermediate scale ( e.g. genius - tf or cuoricino ) .",
    "the recently claimed evidence for a signal in the hm data seems still too weak but could be verified in the next future experiments .",
    "+ a strong effort to improve the nme evaluation should be encouraged while stressing on the need of experiments addressed to different nuclei . the possibility to exploit decay experiments to investigate different processes ( as often observed in the past ) should also be stressed .",
