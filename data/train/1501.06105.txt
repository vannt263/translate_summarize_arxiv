    "theorem [ th2 ] provides an explicit expression for the genus polynomial @xmath73 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is defined in the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] . in terms of @xmath73 , the recurrence relation   becomes @xmath76    let @xmath77 be the coefficient of @xmath78 in @xmath73 .",

    "-6ptthis special case of the familiar and easily proved `` interpolation theorem '' of topological graph theory also follows directly from theorem [ thm : c ] .",
    "our goal in this section is to establish in theorem [ thm : rr ] the real - rootedness of the genus polynomials @xmath73 of the iterated claws , via an associated sequence @xmath114 of normalized polynomials .",
    "it follows from this real - rootedness , by newton s theorem ( e.g. , see @xcite , theorem 2 ) , that the genus polynomials for iterated claws are log - concave .",
    "to proceed , we `` normalize '' the polynomials @xmath73 by defining @xmath115 so that @xmath114 starts from a non - zero constant term , and has the same non - zero roots as @xmath73 .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath116 to denote the degree of @xmath114 , that is , @xmath117 by theorem  [ thm : c ] , we have @xmath118 . substituting  ( [ def : w ] ) into the recurrence relation  ( [ rec : gamma ] ) , we derive @xmath119 with the initial polynomials @xmath120        since @xmath124 is a polynomial with positive coefficients , we have @xmath131 we suppose first that @xmath132 is odd , and we consider the curve  @xmath124 .",

    "it is clear that the curve @xmath124 continues going forward , intersecting the @xmath134-axis in this alternating way .",
    "it follows from this alternation that @xmath141 from  ( [ sgn : lem : y1 ] ) and  , we conclude that  ( [ lem : interlacing : p ] ) holds for all @xmath142 , when @xmath132 is odd .    we next suppose that @xmath132 is even . in this case",
    ", we can draw the curve @xmath124 so that it starts in the upper half plane , first intersects the @xmath134-axis at @xmath135 , then goes below the axis up to @xmath136 , and continues alternatingly . therefore the sign - alternating relation  ( [ sgn : lem : pp<0 ] ) still holds . since @xmath143",

    "we define @xmath157 and @xmath158 , for all @xmath155 .",
    "to clarify the interlacing properties , we now consider the signs of the function @xmath159 at @xmath160 and at the origin , for any @xmath161 .",
    "since @xmath159 is a polynomial of degree @xmath162 , with all coefficients non - negative , we deduce that @xmath163 having the constant term positive implies that @xmath164    by the intermediate value theorem and inequality  ( [ sgn : claw :- infty ] ) , for the polynomial  @xmath114 to have  @xmath165 distinct negative roots and for part  ( i ) of theorem  [ thm : rr ] to hold , it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath166 in fact , for @xmath167 , inequality  ( [ dsr : claw : n : n-2 ] ) becomes @xmath168 by  ( [ sgn : claw:0 ] ) , inequality holds if and only if @xmath169 is odd , which is true since @xmath170    now consider any @xmath13 such that @xmath171 .",
    "we are going to prove  ( [ dsr : claw : n : n-2 ] ) .",
    "we will use the particular indicator function @xmath172 , which is defined by @xmath173 note that @xmath174 is a root of @xmath147 . by recurrence  ( [ rec : w ] ) , we have @xmath175 since @xmath176 , the factor @xmath177 contributes @xmath178 to the sign of the right hand side of  ( [ rec : claw : n : n-2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the sign of the parenthesized factor can be determined if both the summands @xmath179 and @xmath180 have the same sign .",
    "therefore , inequality  ( [ dsr : claw : n : n-2 ] ) holds if @xmath181    by the induction hypothesis on part  ( ii ) of this theorem , we can substitute @xmath182 and @xmath183 into lemma  [ lem : interlacing ]",
    ". then inequality  ( [ lem : interlacing : p ] ) gives @xmath184 thus , inequality  ( [ dsr : claw : n-1:n-2 ] ) holds if and only if the total power @xmath185 of @xmath186 in  ( [ dsr : claw : n-1:n-2 ] ) and  ( [ sgn : claw : n-1:n-2 ] ) is even , which is clear by a simple parity argument .",
    "moreover , again using the induction hypothesis on part  ( ii ) , we can make substitutions @xmath187 and @xmath188 into lemma  [ lem : interlacing ] .",
    "then inequality  ( [ lem : interlacing : q ] ) gives @xmath189 thus , inequality  ( [ dsr : claw : n-3:n-2 ] ) holds if and only if the total power @xmath190 of @xmath186 in  ( [ dsr : claw : n-3:n-2 ] ) and  ( [ sgn : claw : n-3:n-2 ] ) is odd , which is also clear by a simple parity argument .",
    "this completes the proof of  ( [ dsr : claw : n : n-2 ] ) , and the proof of part  ( i ) .",
    "the approach to proving part ( ii ) is similar to that used to prove part ( i ) . by the intermediate value theorem and inequality  ( [ sgn : claw :- infty ] ) , part ( ii ) holds if and only if @xmath191 and also for @xmath192 when @xmath109 is even .",
    "in fact , when @xmath109 is even and @xmath192 , we have @xmath193 by  ( [ sgn : claw:0 ] ) , inequality holds if and only if @xmath194 , which is clear since @xmath195    for @xmath196 , we are now going to show  ( [ dsr : claw : n : n-1 ] ) . by setting @xmath197 ,",
    "recurrence  ( [ rec : w ] ) turns into @xmath198 since @xmath199 , we see that @xmath200 , and that the factor @xmath201 contributes @xmath178 to the sign of the right - hand side of  ( [ rec : claw : n : n-1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , inequality  ( [ dsr : claw : n : n-1 ] ) holds if @xmath202    substituting @xmath203 and @xmath204 into lemma  [ lem : interlacing ] , we find that inequality  ( [ lem : interlacing : q ] ) yields @xmath205 thus , inequality  ( [ dsr : claw : n-2:n-1 ] ) holds if and only if the total power @xmath206 of @xmath186 in  ( [ dsr : claw : n-2:n-1 ] ) and  ( [ sgn : claw : n-2:n-1 ] ) is odd , which holds true , obviously , by parity . on the other hand , by the induction hypothesis on part  ( i ) and substituting @xmath203 and @xmath188 into lemma  [ lem : interlacing ] , inequality  ( [ lem : interlacing : q ] )",
    "becomes @xmath207 therefore , inequality  ( [ dsr : claw : n-3:n-1 ] ) holds if and only if the total power @xmath208 of @xmath186 in  ( [ dsr : claw : n-3:n-1 ] ) and  ( [ sgn : claw : n-3:n-1 ] ) is odd , which coincides with  ( [ totalpower : n-3 ] ) .",
