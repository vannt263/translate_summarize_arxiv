    "on the basis of star counts , gilmore & reid ( 1983 ) argued that the galaxy contains a second disk population , with a larger vertical scale distribution and hotter kinematics than the  classical old disk \" .",
    "this  thick disk \" , as it is now commonly called , is of considerable relevance to the understanding of the evolution of our galaxy and , by extension , other disk galaxies .",
    "does the development of all disk galaxies involve such a thick disk and , if so , why ?",
    "if the thick disk is such a  pre - destined \" evolutionary stage , can we determine its relationship with the other galactic stellar populations , including the halo , the thin disk , and the bulge ?    or",
    "does the thick disk of the milky way represent an entanglement or a merger with another , presumably much smaller , galaxy ?",
    "if so , are such encounters stochastic and infrequent among disk galaxies or are such encounters expected as part of some sort of hierarchical assembly of large galaxies out of cannibalization of smaller ones ?    the salient properties of the thick disk , and clues to answering these questions , include the relative masses of the thick and thin disks , the vertical scale height , the mean metallicity , the metallicity gradient , the kinematics , the age ( and age spread , if one is detectable ) , and the chemical evolution .",
    "the last property is the subject of this paper , but , as we discuss , it is not independent of the others .",
    "the mid - plane density normalization of the thick disk relative to the thin disk has been the subject of serious study since the thick disk s discovery , and the subject is well reviewed by chen et al .",
    "they employed the sloan digital sky survey to provide a comprehensive new attack on the problem , finding preferred vertical scale heights of between 580 and 750  pc for the thick disk , compared to 330  pc for the thin disk .",
    "since density normalization is directly related to scale heights , this range in values implies mid - plane density normalizations of 13% down to 6.5% .",
    "it is worth recalling that heating over a long period of time of galactic thin disk stars by spiral arms or a central bar , giant molecular clouds , or accretion and enlargement of the galactic disk are unable to explain such a difference in the scale heights ( jenkins 1992 ; asiain , figueras , & torra 1999 ; fuchs et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the local mean metallicity , @xmath6[fe / h]@xmath7 , of the thick disk is between @xmath80.5 and @xmath80.7 ( gilmore & wise 1985 , carney et al .",
    "1989 , gilmore et al .  1995 ; chiba & beers 2000 ) .",
    "the mean metallicity and spread are very similar to what is seen among the disk globular clusters identified by zinn ( 1985 ; see also armandroff 1989 ) , and there is some evidence of a metal - weak tail extending down to [ fe / h]=@xmath81.6 ( norris et al .  1985 , martin & morrison 1998 ) . though the average metallicity of the thick disk is only one third that of the thin disk , and much higher than that of the halo , the metallicity ranges certainly overlap , making it difficult to separate the two components based solely on metallicity",
    ".    the thick disk may be most readily distinguished from the thin disk in kinematics .",
    "the asymmetric drift of the thick disk has been measured between 20 km  s@xmath9  ( chiba & beers 2000 ) and 50 km  s@xmath9  ( carney et al .",
    "soubiran et al .  ( 2003 ) and bensby et al .  (",
    "2003 ) agreed well of the values for the asymmetric drift , @xmath6v@xmath7 , and the velocity ellipsoid [ @xmath10(u):@xmath10(v):@xmath10(w ) ] of the galactic thin disk , thick disk , and halo stellar populations , with @xmath6v@xmath7 @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 km  s@xmath9 , and velocity ellipsoids of , approximately , ( 35:20:16 ) , ( 67:38:35 ) , and ( 160:90:90 ) km  s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "these differences may be exploited to assign probabilities of membership in the thin disk , thick disk , and halo populations , and throughout this paper we follow the formulations employed by venn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "a key property , and one overlooked occasionally , is that the thick disk appears to be about as old as the galactic halo .",
    "bensby et al .",
    "( 2004b ) have attacked the question of the relative ages of the thin disk and thick disk field stars , using field stars whose ages may be estimated individually , and whose population membership may be assigned probabilistically on the basis of kinematics .",
    "they find no evidence for age differences for thick disk stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 , but for the minority of stars more metal - rich than this limit , an age spread of several gyrs may exist .",
    "as they noted , this is also consistent with the appearance of contributions by type  ia supernovae at that metallicity level , and which we address also in this paper .",
    "the milky way is not the only galaxy which possesses a thick disk population . indeed ,",
    "dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) have found them in all of the 47 disk systems they surveyed .",
    "however , it is not clear if the envelopes they detected are thick disks or a galactic halo , because the limiting surface brightnesses they reached are comparable to where zibetti , white , & brinkmann ( 2004 ) have detected the appearance of faint spheroidal components .",
    "nonetheless , the work of dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) breaks new ground since earlier work did not reveal thick disks in all edge - on disk galaxies ( morrison , harding , & boroson 1994 ; fry et al .",
    "the absence of thick disks in other galaxies would support the idea that thick disks arise from ",
    "accidents \" , probably encounters with other galaxies , rather than being a natural part of the formation of a thin disk .",
    "however , as dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) argued , the near - universality of thick disks does not necessarily mean that they arise independently of encounters .",
    "while it is true that the red colors of extra - galactic thick disks indicate great ages , consistent with the  monolithic \" formation idea , the thick disks do not appear to show any correlations with the sizes of the thin disks , nor with the presence or absence of galactic bulges .",
    "dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) suggested , instead , that thick disks could be expected from the hierarchical assembly of galaxies , in which case no such correlations would be expected .",
    "a particularly nice piece of work showing the dissimilarity between some thin and thick disk populations is that of yoachim & dalcanton ( 2005 ) .",
    "we note that dalcanton & bernstein ( 2002 ) commented on the apparent similarity of the galactic thick disk and thin disk stellar populations chemical abundance patterns rules out independent origins , a conclusion that now appears to have been premature , and which is the subject of our study .",
    "several groups ( gilmore 1984 ; wyse & gilmore 1988 ; sandage 1990 ; burkert , truran , & hensler 1992 ; pardi , ferrini , & matteucci 1995 ) have advocated that the thick disk was a precursor to the  old thin disk \" , and thus a thick disk is a natural early step in the chemodynamical evolution of galactic disks .",
    "burkert et al .",
    "( 1992 ) argued for a rapid ( 300 - 400  myr ) thick disk formation phase .",
    "such a rapid process would result in a thick disk with a very small age range and little or no metallicity gradient , as has been observed .",
    "however , such models predict a smooth transition to the thin disk predicting continuous age , [ fe / h ] , [ x / fe ] , and kinematic relationships .    rather than a ",
    "pre - ordained \" evolutionary scenario , the thick disk may have resulted from an encounter with a small galaxy , with a mass roughly like that of the magellanic clouds .",
    "simulations by quinn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and sellwood , nelson , & tremaine ( 1998 ) have shown that a thick disk can form during a merger event by the heating of a pre - existing cold , thin disk .",
    "because the old disks are wrecked in the merging process , any thin disk we see today would have re - formed after the merger event , and the thick disk would be older than the bulk of the oldest stars in the reincarnated thin disk .",
    "a thick disk may also form by the direct accretion of stars from the merging galaxy .",
    "such a view was offered by statler ( 1988 ) , whose model involved the accretion of a  mature \" , mostly stellar , galaxy .",
    "statler showed that accretion can give rise to a boxy distribution similar to a thick disk , though this requires special initial conditions for the cannibalized galaxy s orbit . in merger models there need not be continuity between the kinematics or chemical abundances of the thick and thin disks .",
    "distinguishing between evolutionary models and merger models requires age , kinematic , and abundance data for the halo , thick disk , and thin disk , especially at the transitions between the populations .",
    "carney , latham , & laird ( 1989 ) argued that the thick disk is too distinct in its chemodynamical behavior , manifested , for example , by [ fe / h ] vs.  @xmath16w@xmath16 velocity , to share a common origin with the thin disk .",
    "instead , they argued that the thick disk is likely to have arisen from a merger event , but a major one that involved already - assembled galaxies .",
    "the star formation in the victim may have been largely completed long before the actual merger .",
    "mixing of stars from an accreted galaxy into the milky way , and scattering of stellar orbits via encounters with spiral arms , the central bar , or giant molecular clouds , will blur the kinematic signatures of a merger event .",
    "the orbital angular momentum , represented in the solar neighborhood by the galactic v velocity , may be the best conserved kinematic property . in addition , stars retain the history of star formation in their abundance patterns , what freeman & bland - hawthorn ( 2002 ) have called  chemical tagging \" .",
    "an ensemble of gas and stars should initially yield stars whose abundance patterns reflect only the ejecta from sne  ii , which is thought to be the main production site of the @xmath0-elements ( o , mg , si , ca , ti ) and @xmath4-process elements .",
    "sne  ii arise from relatively massive stars , and hence the timescale for the appearance of their ejecta should be @xmath17 years .",
    "low - mass ( m @xmath6 4 m@xmath18 ) agb stars are thought to be a major production site for @xmath3-process elements ( busso et al .",
    "1999 ) , and such stars begin releasing these elements into the ism in about @xmath19 yrs , significantly later than @xmath4-process elements from sne  ii .",
    "the @xmath4- to @xmath3-process ratio should therefore be higher at the earliest epochs in a population s history and the metallicity where this ratio begins to decrease can give a star formation rate time - scale .",
    "sne  ia begin to appear even later , perhaps within about @xmath20 years ( see matteuchi & recchi 2001 ) , and if star formation is slow enough for their ejecta to be incorporated into gas still undergoing star formation , the signature should appear at the mean metallicity the interstellar medium and newly - forming stars had reached .",
    "this is the basic explanation for the enhanced abundances of @xmath0- elements seen in stars in the solar neighborhood at the lowest metallicities , and the steady decline in [ @xmath0/fe ] abundances from [ fe / h ] @xmath11 @xmath1 and higher . in other words ,",
    "the solar neighborhood interstellar medium had reached a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath11 @xmath21 before the sne  ia began to significantly enrich the interstellar medium . had star formation been more rapid , the metallicity would be higher before the sne  ia contribution begin to appear .",
    "thus one possible test of the inter - relationship between thin disk and thick disk populations is whether they share a common [ @xmath0/fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] relation .",
    "if they do , the common history model is strengthened . if they do not",
    ", then one must either conclude that the thick disk evolved independently of the thin disk , or that the chemical enrichment models of the joint thick disk - thin disk evolution are much more complicated .",
    "one of the pioneering papers in this field is that by edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who studied the abundances of 13 elements in 189 relatively bright , nearby dwarf stars .",
    "the stars were selected so that the sample covered a wide range in [ fe / h ] , and with an admixture of some halo population stars , judged by both metallicity and kinematics .",
    "the stars were also selected so that ages could be estimated for individual stars , and that those ages covered a very wide range , from less than 1 gyr to roughly the age of the halo .",
    "photometric metallicities enabled them to select stars on the basis of a range of ages . the kinematical data ( proper motions and radial velocities ) led to the caculation of space velocities and galactic orbits , a truly comprehensive approach to the problem of the galaxy s chemodynamical evolution .",
    "at the risk of doing injustice to such a major piece of work , we summarize their three primary results briefly as the following .",
    "1 . as had been described earlier ( see wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) , [ @xmath0/fe ] is elevated by about 0.3 dex with respect to the sun for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath22 , but that it declines as a function of [ fe / h ] for higher metallicities , reaching a solar value at [ fe / h ] = 0.0 .",
    "2 . this trend appears to depend on the mean galactocentric distance of the stars involved .",
    "the trend is different for stars with smaller mean galactcocentric distances , which could be explained by a higher star formation rate in the denser inner regions of the galactic disk .",
    "we point out that thick disk stars in the solar neighborhood , with larger values of the asymmetric drift , may also have smaller mean galactocentric distances , and hence the interpretation of these results could also be explained by a separate chemical evolutionary history for the thick disk rather than provide insight into the chemical evolution of the galactic disk itself .",
    "3 . the galactic disk does not appear to reveal an age - metallicity relation , as simple models of chemical evolution predict .",
    "the explanation offered most readily is that this might be explained by a combination of vigorous mixing of supernovae ejecta within the disk and infall of metal - deficient gas into the solar neighborhood .",
    "an alternative not considered by edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , but recently raised by bensby , feltzing , & lundstrm ( 2004b ) , is that the lack of a correlation between age and metallicity could have resulted from a sample that inter - mixed two populations with differing mean metallicities and differing age - metallicity relations .",
    "one good example of the challenges of target selection is the work of chen et al .",
    "they studied 90 disk dwarfs with accurate parallaxes and kinematical data , and for which they could estimate ages for individual stars .",
    "they found that stars that kinematically resemble the thick disk follow a very similar trend in [ @xmath0/fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] as do the stars of the thin disk .",
    "this supports the evolutionary model .",
    "however , the temperature regime for their target stars essentially rules out any long - lived stars in their sample , and if age is indeed a defining characteristic of the thick disk , then their adopted sample of thick disk stars may have simply included stars from the higher velocity tails of the thin disk velocity distributions .",
    "thus the apparent agreement between the chemical evolution of the thin disk and thick disk may be spurious .",
    "gratton et al .  ( 2003 ) added kinematics to the chemical abundance analyses of about 200 stars from carretta , gratton , and sneden ( 2000 ) .",
    "their careful analyses , especially in the difficult matter of oxygen abundances , confirmed the onset of the decline in [ o / fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath23 for halo stars .",
    "however , their program stars were drawn from a wide variety of sources , so selection effects are hard to disentangle , and the ages of individual stars were not considered .",
    "fuhrmann ( 1998 ) initiated a large program of chemical abundances analyses of nearby f and g stars , mostly dwarfs but extending to subgiants near the main sequence turn - off .",
    "he employed kinematics ( in a manner not well described ) to distinguish between thin disk , thick disk , and halo stars , and was among the first to notice that the thick disk stars do not appear to follow the same [ mg / fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] trend as do thin disk stars .",
    "his work has been continued by mashonkina & gehren ( 2000 , 2001 , 2003 ) in studies of [ ba / fe ] and [ eu / fe ] in the first two studies , and of more metal - poor stars in the last study .",
    "they confirmed differences in the [ x / fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] trends of thick disk vs.  thin disk stars .",
    "fuhrmann ( 2004 ) also undertook a comprehensive re - evaluation of the relative ages of the thin and thick disks based on a sample of roughly 150 field stars , concluding that the thick disk represents the first stage of the formation of the galactic disk , and that a hiatus of perhaps 3 gyrs ensued prior to the chemical evolution of the thin disk .",
    "a recent comprehensive literature study by soubiran & girard ( 2005 ) suggests a similar age difference , and confirms again the separate chemical enrichment histories of the two populations .",
    "a much smaller sample , only ten stars , was studied by prochaska et al .",
    "however , these stars were selected on the basis of both kinematics and  ages \" , in the form of life expectancies that equal or exceed the age of the galaxy , thereby minimizing the dilution of the sample by younger , hence thin disk , stars , which we have noted afflicted the study by chen et al .",
    "venn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) confirmed the high probability of thick disk membership for all ten stars .",
    "a potential systematic effect may exist , however , since prochaska et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did not analyze a similar sample of thin disk stars .",
    "possible differences in adopted @xmath24 values or other analytical techniques raise the possibility of systematic effects creating differences where none exist or , alternatively , blurring or even erasing them when they do exist .",
    "prochaska found that the thick disk behaves differently than the thin disk , supporting the accretion model , especially in the abundances of the @xmath0 elements and the @xmath4-process element europium , a result obtained as well by mashonkina et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "reddy et al .  ( 2003 ) analyzed a much larger sample , 181 f and g dwarfs , studying abundances of 27 elements that span the critical classes of nucleosynthesis : cno , @xmath0 , iron - peak , @xmath3-process , and @xmath4-process .",
    "the stars were selected employing kinematics and ages as the primary criteria , and the large majority of their stars belong to the thin disk .",
    "while they also noted different chemical evolutionary behaviors between the thin disk and the thick disk , perhaps their most important result was clear evidence for the expected thin disk age - metallicity relation with the remarkably small scatter in the relation .",
    "this suggests that the study of edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) may indeed have been compromised by mixing of the thin disk and thick disk in uncertain proportions .    in our opinion ,",
    "the most important ensemble of studies regarding the chemical evolution of the thin disk and thick disk populations are those of feltzing , bensby , & lundstrm ( 2003 ) , bensby , feltzing , & lundstrm ( 2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) , and bensby et al .",
    "these authors studied a sample comparable in size to those of edvarsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , but were careful to distinguish thin disk and thick disk stars on the basis of their kinematics , using adopted mid - plane density ratios , asymmetric drifts , and velocity ellipsoids .",
    "further , their sample covered a critical range of metallicities , including thick disk stars at the higher metallicities than have been traditionally , but probably incorrectly , assumed to be  reserved \" to the thin disk , [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath25 .",
    "bensby et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004a , 2005 ) , found , as had others , that the thick disk and thin disk populations begin to diverge in [ @xmath0/fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] for key elements at [ fe / h ] @xmath23 , with the thin disk [ @xmath0/fe ] declining while the thick disk [ @xmath0/fe ] values remain constant .",
    "further , they also found that the thick disk population also begins to show a decline in [ @xmath0/fe ] toward solar values beginning at [ fe / h ] @xmath26 .",
    "thus the metal - rich tail of the thick disk appears to have formed long enough after the onset of star formation for sne  ia to contribute their ejecta to the remaining gas , or , perhaps , that the remaining gas was mixed into a larger reservoir in which the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio was already reduced .",
    "we have noted above that bensby et al .",
    "( 2004b ) found that even among the stars in their sample most likely to belong to the thick disk ( their td / d @xmath7 10 sample ) , the most metal - rich stars appear to be several gyrs younger than the more metal - poor stars .",
    "finally , mishenina et al .  ( 2004 ) obtained abundances for magnesium and silicon ( @xmath0 elements ) , as well as iron and nickel , in 174 f , g , and k dwarfs , and confirmed the break in the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] of the thick disk at [ fe / h ] @xmath27 , and that the thin disk and thick disk are chemically distinct . unfortunately , none of their program stars had estimated ages , and some of the stars appear to have relatively short life expectancies .",
    "we have selected our targets for abundance determinations following an unpublished study by nauomov ( 1999 ) of the galaxy s thin disk and thick disk stellar populations .",
    "his work comprised two parts . in the first",
    ", he undertook an exhaustive review of all available _ uvby _ photometry and parallax data and he selected dwarfs generally lying within 100  pc of the sun .",
    "temperatures were determined using the color - temperature calibrations of alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger ( 1996 ) .",
    "nauomov employed the olsen ( 1993 ) catalogue in an unbiased manner , selecting all stars with with @xmath28 @xmath29 0.4 , corresponding to stars cooler than @xmath115700  k , and having life expectancies on order of the thick disk s age .",
    "this criterion was chosen based on the estimated turn - off temperature of 47  tuc , and resulted in a sample of 269 stars .",
    "in the second part , nauomov obtained objective prism spectra near the galactic mid - plane using narrow - band interference filters to enable classification of stars as faint as @xmath30 mag .",
    "spectral indices enabled him to distinguish dwarfs from giants , and to determine effective temperatures .",
    "again , there were no selection effects that might bias the sample in favor of thin disk or thick disk stars on the bases of either kinematics or chemistry .",
    "short - exposure direct imaging ccd observations taken with the same telescope produced @xmath31 magnitudes and @xmath32 color indices .",
    "nauomov compared the temperature estimates from the reddening - independent line indices and the observed @xmath32 colors to estimate the reddening for each star .",
    "this second sample was likewise trimmed so that only long - lived stars remained .    the resultant sample , comprising roughly 1200 stars near the sun or at least near the galactic plane ,",
    "was then studied using the center for astrophysics radial velocity speedometers . from these spectra",
    ", nauomov was able to determine radial velocities with individual measurement precisions of better than 1 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "further , with confidence that all the program stars are dwarfs , and with knowledge of the temperatures , nauomov could determine mean metallicities following the procedures described by carney et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1994 ) and laird et al .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsrv ] shows the results for the stars selected from the olsen ( 1993 ) catalog , as well as the stars selected from the objective prism observations with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that the radial velocity is a direct measure of the v velocity .",
    "the figure merits careful consideration .",
    "as expected , one sees the thin disk with @xmath6v@xmath7 @xmath11 0  km  s@xmath9 , and dispersion of order 20 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the thin disk range in [ fe / h ] is approximately from @xmath21 to slightly above solar .",
    "note that there are very few stars in the figure with v velocities as high as + 50 km  s@xmath9 , but a considerable number with v @xmath35 km  s@xmath9 . that excess , we believe , represents the thick disk .    in figure",
    "[ fig : vhistfem03m10 ] we show the v velocity histogram for stars with @xmath36  [ fe / h  @xmath37 .",
    "the thick disk signature is distinct , with a peak , as expected , near @xmath13 km  s@xmath9 , and it is clear that the thick disk is a minor component near mid - plane , consistent with the results of chen et al .",

    "the thick disk stars appears to maintain a characteristic signature v velocity at _ all _ values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "this supports an independent origin , presumably later involving accetion , for the origin of the thick disk , and that it is not an antecedent to the thin disk . for the purposes of this paper , figure  [ fig : lsrv ]",
    "also enables us to select our program stars .",
    "we chose to limit our subsequent studies of stars to those with @xmath38 photometry .",
    "we re - calculated u , v , and w velocities for the 269 stars in naumov s ( 1999 ) sample based on parallaxes and proper motions from the hipparcos catalogue ( perryman et al .",

    "the distance from the origin in such a diagram is a measure of a star s energy of motion , itself also an approximately conserved quanitity .",
    "stars were also chosen on the basis of scientific goals , in the sense that we wished to have comparable numbers of thin disk and thick disk stars , that they span similar ranges of metallicity , and that all stars have similar effective temperatures to minimize any potential systematic effects in our analyses .",

    "we note that la has fewer potential problems than does ba in the abundance determinations since the la lines are weaker , and form deeper in the stellar atmospheres , where non - lte effects are less likely to introduce systematic errors .",

    "the scatter is unfortunately too large to enable us to draw any meaningful conclusions .",
    "we summarize here what we believe to be the key points regarding an independent origin for the thick disk and the implied accretion of its parent galaxy .",
    "first , the thick disk stars , at least in the solar neighborhood , are old ( see figure  [ fig : ar0 ] and the discussion in section  1 ) .",
    "second , the thick disk appears to have the same mean metallicity , independent of distance from the plane .",
    "there is no vertical metallicity gradient ( carney et al .",
    "1989 ; gilmore et al .  1995 ) .",
    "third , the limited evidence appears to show that the thin and thick disk populations maintain distinctive [ fe / h ] vs.  angular momentum trends ( figure  [ fig : lsrv ] ) .",
    "finally , our results ( figures  [ fig : alpha]-[fig : rpros ] ) and those of others ( figures  [ fig : othersalphafe]-[fig : othersstor ] ) clearly show that the chemical enrichment histories of the thin and thick disk stellar populations have been very different , with the most prominent signature being that star formation proceeded more rapidly in the thick disk , such that [ fe / h ] had reached levels as high as [ fe / h ] @xmath94 before contributions from sne  ia became significant , whereas in the thin disk star formation was slower , and sne  ia contributions began to appear when [ fe / h ] @xmath95 .",
    "we concur with venn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the abundance patterns seen among the dwarf galaxies that have been studied can not be reconciled with those seen in among the thick disk stars , even when attention is restricted to those galaxies that completed their star formation in one primary , if possibly prolonged , burst .",
    "we say  prolonged \" because the low [ @xmath0/fe ] values suggest sne  ia events were contributing to the pollution of the interstellar media of these galaxies even when the [ fe / h ] levels were still very low .",
    "indeed , the low mean metallicities of these galaxies suggests that they were unable to retain the bulk of their gas and did not evolve as  closed box \" systems .",
    "the thick disk , on the other hand , has a high mean metallicity .",
    "if the thick disk arose due to the accretion of a small galaxy by the milky way , @xmath6[fe / h]@xmath96 suggests a fairly massive parent galaxy , comparable in mass to the magellanic clouds ( see grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 for a good discussion of the relationships between dwarf galaxies mean metallicities and luminosities . ) unfortunately , direct comparison with elemental abundances and abundance ratios in thick disk stars and stars in the magellanic clouds is compromised by the continued star formation in both clouds , and in the bulk of the available analyses referring to stars with younger ages .",
    "we would be caught in the same problems to which we have referred before were we to attempt such comparisons .",
    "there are three remaining questions we may ask nonetheless .",
    "first , what type of galaxy might have converted most of its gas into stars rapidly , so that we could see a behavior from its remnants within the milky way consistent with figure  [ fig : ar0 ] ?",
    "the answer does not appear to involve dwarf galaxies like the magellanic clouds nor the dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "but it could have been a more compact dwarf elliptical galaxy .",
    "second , what is known about the abundance patterns in dwarf elliptical galaxies ?",
    "unfortunately , not very much , given their large distances .",
    "m32 is an interesting test case , and the literature is full of contradictory claims about the mean age and mean metallicity of its central regions , as well as about the bulk of its stellar population .",
    "the situation is finally becoming clearer ( schiavon , caldwell , & rose 2004 ; rose et al .",
    "2004 ; worthey 2004 ) . in the core of the galaxy",
    ", @xmath6[fe / h]@xmath7 is higher than solar , and [ mg / fe ] is subsolar . from a chemical evolution perspective",
    ", this suggests that the core of m32 had a prolonged star formation history , enabling sne  ia to contribute very significantly to the chemical enrichment .",
    "schiavon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , in fact , argue that the luminosity - weighted age of the stars in the core of m32 is only a few gyrs , consistent with this view .",
    "the situation changes outside the core , with @xmath6[fe / h]@xmath7 declining to @xmath97 at one effective radius .",
    "the weighted age rises as well , by about 3 gyrs , although that remains very young in comparison to the age of the galaxy s thick disk stellar population .",
    "as would be expected , [ mg / fe ] is somewhat higher at one effective radius , roughly @xmath98 compared to @xmath99 in the core , but it remains subsolar and consistent with prolonged star formation . we conclude that m32 , in its present state , is , like the other surviving dwarf galaxies , not a good template for the progenitor of the galactic thick disk , although it is possible that had it merged with the milky way very early in its chemical evolution , it might have resulted in what we see today .",
    "we can not distinguish the detailed chemical enrichment history of m32 , unfortunately .",
    "third , what lessons may we learn from the wealth of elemental abundance ratios we and our colleagues have determined from careful studies of thick disk stars ?",
    "there appear to be several answers , although not all are as firmly established as we desire .",
    "* the  traditional \" @xmath0-elements o , mg , ca , and si are enhanced relative to iron , for thick disk stars from [ fe / h ] values as high as @xmath2 , at which point the abundance ratios begin to decline toward solar values .",
    "this can be understood , as we have stressed , if those elements arise in the rapid evolution of massive stars , and that such stars were able to enrich the interstellar medium of the thick disk s progenitor galaxy much more rapidly than did the thin disk .",
    "sne  ia begin to appear in the thin disk when [ fe / h ] @xmath95 while the thick disk was able to reach [ fe / h @xmath94 .",
    "* apparently other elements in the thick disk stars were also created primarily in rapidly - evolving massive stars , including ti , sc , v , co , zn , and eu . the latter element",
    "s comparable behavior is not at all surprising since in the solar system it is thought to have been created primarily in the @xmath4-process . *",
    "the uniformity of the [ ba / y ] ratio in thick disk stars , and its similarity to values in seen among thin disk stars , at least for [ fe / h ] @xmath75 , suggests that only one of the two processes , the _ weak _ or the _ main _ @xmath3-process , were working .",
    "perhaps neither @xmath3-process was working : ytrrium and barium both have contributions from the @xmath4-process .",
    "qualitatively , we would expect enhanced [ eu / y ] and enhanced [ eu / ba ] ratios , as seen in figure  [ fig : othersstor ] .",
    "qantitatively , however , the actual ratios appear to fall short of  pure \" @xmath4-process predictions . and",
    "it is also possible , even likely , that we have too few data , and that the scatter is too large , to discern the appearance or change in the relative contributions of the two @xmath3-processes .",
    "* there is almost a  step function \" or at least a very steep slope signifying rapid changes in the abundances of [ eu / y ] and [ eu / fe ] , beginning at [ fe / h ] @xmath5 .",
    "either a new nucleosynthesis source began to appear in the thick disk interstellar medium , or , possibly , its interstellar medium was being diluted by that of the galactic thin disk .",
    "this could be a signal of the merger event itself .      in the above discussions we have assumed that the progenitor of the thick disk was a separate galaxy , which underwent its own star formation history , and which subsequently was captured and absorbed by the milky way , as opposed to the idea that the disk itself has experienced rather distinct episodes of star formation , for reasons that are not well understood .",
    "there is , perhaps , an attractive alternative that blends aspects of both metaphors .",
    "in essence , if galaxies are assembled in a hierarchical fashion , such that small units merge to make larger ones , out of which eventually emerge the galaxies we see today , the thick disk might have resulted from a merger of a moderately large such galaxy , but at an early time in the formation of the milky way itself .",
    "the thick disk progenitor would have still experienced a different chemical enrichment history , although perhaps not for very long .",
    "brook et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) have developed chemodynamical evolutionary models that explain the observed features of the thick disk vs.  the thin disk , including the differences in kinematics as well as [ @xmath0/fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] .",
    "we certainly look forward to even more detailed models that explore as well the heavy @xmath3-process and @xmath4-process elements .",
    "we conclude that the thick disk does appear to have undergone a chemical enrichment history that was separate from that of the thin disk , most probably in a nearby dwarf galaxy .",
    "the star formation history was , however , sufficiently prolonged that sne  ia were contributing to the galaxy s interstellar medium by the time that the mean metallicity level had reached [ fe / h ] = @xmath2 ( or , alternatively , [ @xmath0/h ] @xmath100 ) , where we now we could include sc , v , co , zn , and eu in this broad mix as elements created in the same mass range of stars , albeit in different sites , as the more  traditional \" @xmath0-elements . when @xmath6[fe / h]@xmath7 in the thick disk parent galaxy reached @xmath5 , however , its stars _ and _ gas appear to have merged with the milky way .",

    "<S> we have studied 23 long - lived g dwarfs that belong to the thin disk and thick disk stellar populations . </S>",

    "<S> the decline in [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ eu / fe ] does not begin at [ fe / h ] = @xmath1 , but at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> other elements share this same behavior , including sc , co , and zn , suggesting that at least in the chemical enrichment history of the thick disk , these elements were manufactured in similar - mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy @xmath3-process elements ba , la , ce , and nd are over - abundant in the thin disk stars relative to the thick disk stars . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the constancy of the [ ba / y ] ratio suggests that only one @xmath3-process site was manufacturing these elements , or , possibly , that the @xmath4-process was responsible for the bulk of the nucleosynthesis of these elements . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our results with other studies ( edvardsson et al . , prochaska et al . , bensby et al . , and reddy et al . ) , who had already found very similar trends , in order to further explore the origin of the thick disk . </S>",
