    "a perfect , deterministic , amplification of a quantum field is fundamentally impossible since a certain level of noise is inevitably introduced due to the uncertainty principle .",
    "this may put a practical limitation in quantum measurement and also provide a crucial basis for secure quantum communications .",
    "for example , the distinguishability of two quantum states can not be improved by amplifying the input signals . in another respect ,",
    "a malicious party intervening in quantum cryptography can not obtain perfect clones of an unknown quantum state under communication @xcite .",
    "the quantum - noise limit was identified for both the phase - insensitive and the phase - sensitive linear amplifiers by caves @xcite .",
    "the noise in the phase - insensitive linear amplifier ( pila ) generally degrades the nonclassicality of a quantum state being amplified unlike the case of the phase - sensitive one ( e.g. , squeezer ) .",
    "this decoherence effect has been studied for single - mode @xcite and two - mode amplified fields @xcite .",
    "a quantum - limited pila can be experimentally realized by injecting a signal field to a nondegenerate parametric amplifier with the idler field in a vacuum state .",
    "it was also shown recently that the same noise limit can be achieved by employing a linear - optics scheme with a feed - forward based on homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a deterministic scheme , the quantum noise can be significantly reduced if one adopts a probabilistic amplifying scheme .",
    "the so - called  noiseless \" amplifier , though probabilistic , can have practical applications for quantum communications particularly when the probabilistic event of success can be heralded by some means .",
    "much attention has recently been drawn to the implementation of such noiseless amplifiers .",
    "ralph and lund proposed a scheme based on the quantum scissor used between splitting a given input into @xmath0 fields and recombining them @xcite , of which working principle was experimentally demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "this scheme , however , requires an arbitrarily large number of interferometric settings to achieve a high - fidelity performance , only with a very low success probability particularly for a large - amplitude input state @xcite .",
    "instead used a sequence of photon addition and photon subtraction , i.e. , the operation @xmath1 on a weak coherent state @xmath2 to realize a specific gain @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "another interesting scheme , i.e. , adding thermal noise to an input state followed by photon subtraction , was proposed in @xcite , which was also experimentally realized in @xcite . in the latter two schemes , the elementary photonic operations , subtraction @xmath4 and addition @xmath5 ,",
    "provide a key element for a probabilistic amplification .",
    "in fact , over the past years , the photon subtraction @xmath4 proved to be a valuable resource for many applications in quantum informatics , e.g. , improvement of teleportation fidelity @xcite , distillation of entanglement @xcite , manifestation of continuous variable nonlocality @xcite and generation of the schrdinger - cat - like states @xcite .",
    "the photon addition @xmath5 also provides similar advantages @xcite and can transform any classical state into a nonclassical state @xcite . furthermore , the coherent superposition of those two operations was also proposed in the first order @xcite and the high orders @xcite of field operators for quantum - state engineering and fundamental tests .    in this paper , we investigate how the quantum - limited pila can be probabilistically enhanced by employing these elementary operations ",
    "photon subtraction @xmath4 , addition @xmath5 , and a coherent superposition @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we consider the amplification of coherent states and study the quality of the operations in terms of the gain , the fidelity , and the phase uncertainty of the output compared with the input .",
    "compared to the scheme in @xcite , the addition of thermal noise at the initial step is replaced by the use of quantum - limited pila in our scheme while the photon subtraction at the last step can be replaced by the other photonic operations .",
    "the advantage of using the quantum - limited pila over the thermal noise seems rather obvious because the former additionally gives a displacement effect , i.e. , the increase of average amplitude , as well as the addition of noise @xcite . as the pila and",
    "the photonic operations studied here are all within current experimental reach , our scheme represents another practical possibility for a noise - reduced quantum amplifier .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the quantum - limited pila and the probabilistic photonic operations . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate and compare the effects of each probabilistic amplifier on input coherent states in terms of intensity gain , quantum fidelity , and the holevo variance of phase . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize the main results .",
    "a pila at the quantum - noise limit is characterized by the input - output relation as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is an input mode , @xmath9 is the vacuum mode characterizing the fundamental noise introduced via amplification , and @xmath10 is the amplified output at the intensity gain @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this map can be practically implemented in a number of different ways .",
    "one is to inject a signal @xmath8 to a nondegenerate parametric amplifier with the idler mode in a vacuum state .",
    "another is to split an input field @xmath8 via a beam splitter ( bs ) and then displace one output by the amount proportional to the outcome of homodyne measurement on the other output ( feed - forward scheme with linear optics ) @xcite .",
    "one can obtain the glauber @xmath12 function of the amplified output corresponding to eq .",

    "( [ eqn : pila output ] ) , the @xmath12 function of the amplified state , @xmath19 , shows that the output distribution is broadened with the variance of @xmath20 ( noise ) while its center is displaced to @xmath21 ( amplification ) .",
    "now we want to see how the output in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pila output ] ) can be further amplified with reduced noise by applying some probabilistic operations .",
    "the conditional state after performing an operation @xmath22 on @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a normalization constant .",
    "in this paper , we consider the operations @xmath26 ( photon subtraction ) , @xmath27 ( photon addition ) , and @xmath28 ( coherent operation ) . for the case of @xmath26 , an initial state",

    "a similar argument can be given to the operation @xmath27 for which the glauber @xmath12 function is replaced by the husimi @xmath32 function to see the amplification effect . by studying the coherent operation @xmath28",
    ", we can cover the whole range of photonic operations from subtraction ( @xmath33 ) to addition ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "( the condition @xmath35 is used without loss of generality . )    in general , the @xmath36-photon subtraction operation , @xmath37 , can be approximately implemented by injecting an input to a beam splitter with high transmittance and then detecting @xmath36 photons at the auxiliary output mode @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath36-photon addition operation , @xmath38 , can be implemented by injecting an input to a nondegenerate parametric amplifier and detecting @xmath36 photons at the output idler mode @xcite .",

    "in particular , we investigate the intensity gain , the fidelity , and the phase uncertainty of the output state by each operation with respect to a target amplified state .    the operations @xmath4 and @xmath5 commute with the phase - shift operation @xmath40 .",
    "that is , for @xmath26 and @xmath5 , @xmath41 it means that @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , yield the same effect on an input coherent state @xmath42 regardless of the phase @xmath43 .",
    "this is not true with the coherent operation @xmath39 , for which we therefore take into consideration the average over the whole range of input - state phase @xmath44 $ ] to evaluate performance in the following .",
    "we take @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be real ( @xmath35 ) without loss of generality .",

    "<S> a deterministic quantum amplifier inevitably adds noise to an amplified signal due to the uncertainty principle in quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> we here investigate how a quantum - noise - limited amplifier can be improved by additionally employing the photon subtraction , the photon addition , and a coherent superposition of the two , thereby making a probabilistic , heralded , quantum amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these operations can enhance the performance in amplifying a coherent state in terms of intensity gain , fidelity , and phase uncertainty . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the photon subtraction turns out to be optimal for the fidelity and the phase concentration among these elementary operations , while the photon addition also provides a significant reduction in the phase uncertainty with the largest gain effect . </S>"
