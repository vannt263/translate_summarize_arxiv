    "the nucleon electromagnetic form factors ( em ff s ) represent a relevant chapter in our path towards the understanding of hadron dynamics . it is striking that , after almost half a century of experimental investigations , this field could still hold a number of surprises ( e.g. , the intriguing fall - off of the proton charge ff more rapid than the assumed dipole one ) , or have some kinematical regions not fully explored ( e.g. , the timelike region , in order to obtain separate information on ff s ) . in particular , let us remind ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) that in the spacelike ( sl ) region the existence of a possible zero in @xmath0 for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 the square momentum transfer ) , as suggested by a linear extrapolation of the data obtained by the polarization transfer experiments , could open new perspectives .",
    "indeed , the dipole form of the nucleon ff s is supported by the pqcd , therefore a sharp difference between the charge distribution of the current quarks and the charge distribution of the `` constituent '' quarks appears a clear signature of npqcd effects in act .",
    "even low-@xmath3 ff s ( cf the forthcoming analysis of e08 - 007 at tjlab ) could give new stringent constraints for builders of phenomenological models .",
    "in the the timelike ( tl ) region , analogously relevant issues can be met .",
    "for instance , the neutron data around @xmath4 show a behavior , @xmath5 , sharply different from the one suggested by pqcd , naively indicating @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , tl proton data show many interesting structures ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , that could give a lot of information on the hadronic component of the photon wave function .    on the theoretical side , in a very schematic way , one can list the following approaches : i ) lattice calculations , based on a euclidean 4d space , that can address the sl region only ; ii ) analytic approaches , based on dispersion relations , that can investigate both sl and tl regions , even yielding predictions for the unphysical interval @xmath7 ; iii ) purely phenomenological methods , with constituent quarks ( cq ) as basic ingredients , that can be exploited for describing both sl and tl regions ; iv ) field theoretical approaches , like the ones based on the dyson - schwinger equation , that can be applied to sl and tl regions . in this short review",
    "we will restrict the presentation to i ) , ii ) and iii ) ( see , e.g.,@xcite for a different discussion from i ) to iv ) ) .",
    "it should be also mentioned a quite recent approach based on the gravity dual models of qcd ( or holographic qcd ) , like the one in ref .",
    "in principle , lattice qcd allows one to achieve a non perturbative description of the nucleon ff s , as shown by the more and more accurate results obtained in recent years .",
    "in particular , such interesting outcomes have taken profit from : i ) an impressive growth of the available computing power , that has allowed in nowadays results , e.g. , to release the _ quenched approximation _ ( where the sea - quark loop contributions are disregarded ) ; ii ) new algorithms , leading to a better description of the fundamental symmetries of qcd , and last , but not least , iii ) substantial improvements of the chiral extrapolation techniques .    on the other hand , we should mention the main obstacles to be overcome :    * in a 4d euclidean lattice ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) , one can not directly evaluate the matrix elements of the em current operator .",
    "therefore a careful study of the proper ratio between three- and two - point functions is necessary in order to get `` large values '' of the euclidean time , that eventually allows to filter the contribution from hadronic states with nucleon quantum numbers .",
    "this filtering prevents the study of tl ff s , since an exponential fall - off in time lacks for @xmath9 ; * present lattice data are obtained with values of the coupling constant @xmath10 and the hopping parameter , @xmath11 , that lead to sizable @xmath12 quark masses .",
    "usually , the calculations are labeled by the corresponding pion mass , from which one can infer the quark mass in the actual data . in order to move toward the current quark masses",
    ", one has to reduce the lattice spacing ( that allows to accommodate lighter quarks ) or to exploit extrapolation formulas , obtained from the low - energy regime of the qcd .",
    "unfortunately such chiral extrapolations have a well - known `` non analytic '' ( @xmath13 ) behavior for small value of the pion mass .",
    "the lowest value of the pion mass in the present lattice calculations for the nucleon ff s is @xmath14 @xcite ; * the smallness of momentum transfers investigated in a lattice is related to the space extent , @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 .",
    "this has influence on the range of applicability of the chiral extrapolations , about @xmath17 , not always reached by the present lattices ( e.g. , @xmath18 for the lhp coll .",
    "@xcite and , @xmath19 for the qcdsf coll . @xcite and @xmath20 , for the cyprus - mit coll .",
    "@xcite , but with quenching approximation ) ; * `` large '' momentum transfers in the range of few @xmath21 are in principle accessible by nowadays lattice spacing , but fourier transforms of two- and three - point functions become noise - dominated for square momentum transfers beyond @xmath22 ;     ( upper panel ) and for the `` isovector '' radius ( lower panel ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines : different extrapolation formulas .",
    "( after ref .",
    "@xcite).,title=\"fig:\",width=253 ]   ( upper panel ) and for the `` isovector '' radius ( lower panel ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines : different extrapolation formulas .",
    "( after ref .",
    "@xcite).,title=\"fig:\",width=253 ]    as an example of an updated lattice calculation of the nucleon ff s , the results obtained by the lhp coll .",
    "@xcite , for both the `` isovector '' dirac ff ( obtained through @xmath23 ) and the `` isovector '' radius ( with different extrapolations ) , are shown in fig .",
    "dispersion relation ( dr ) approaches have a very long story . within such a framework",
    ", one can relate real and imaginary parts of the em ff s , once the unitarity ( probability conservation ) and analyticity ( causality ) properties are implemented .",
    "the analysis based on dr allows one to investigate both sl and tl regions , and even the unphysical region in the tl region , where a possible bound state @xmath24 is present , close to the threshold , @xmath25 .",
    "the main ingredient is the dr given by ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 or a once subtracted version , where @xmath28 ( if finite ) appears @xmath29 the next ingredient is a suitable ansatz , physically motivated , for @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , the bonn group @xcite has exploited i ) the form suggested by the decay processes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and related continua and ii ) the constrains from pqcd . in this case , the fit to the experimental data ( sl nucleon ff s and tl proton data ) , has 17 free parameters and a total @xmath34 of 1.8 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the tl neutron calculation represents a prediction of the model . in fig .",
    "[ bonn ] , the tl nucleon ff s obtained in the so - called super convergent approach ( imposed by a proper fall - off of @xmath35 ) are shown .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a different approach has been followed , by directly applying dr to the ratio @xmath36 , both in sl and tl regions .",
    "a very general form for @xmath37 , with six parameters , has been adopted , obtaining a @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ frascati ] , the sl and tl ratios are shown ( for an analysis of all the ff s see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the approach yields two interesting predictions : i ) the position of the sl zero , that depends upon the tl data chosen in the fit , i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; ii ) the asymptotic limits , extracted from the theoretical expressions @xmath41",
    "relativistic cq models have been widely adopted for obtaining a microscopic description of the em properties of the nucleon . since 90 , it was recognized the relevance of dressing the cq s , e.g. by suitable ff s , with a spatial extension of the order of 0.4 - 0.5 fm , ( a scale different from a naive pion - cloud model ) , in order to obtain a very accurate description of the nucleon and pion ff s in the sl region ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after that , new approaches , aimed at a more deep understanding of the degrees of freedom beyond the cq ones , have been developed .",
    "recently , within the manifestly covariant spectator model , a very accurate description of the nucleon ff s in the sl region has been achieved @xcite .",
    "the nucleon , composed of three valence cq s with form factors , has a center of mass motion described by a solution of the dirac equation , while the intrinsic dynamics is given by a phenomenological s - wave state , consistent with the properly symmetrized covariant spectator formalism .",
    "the independence of the intrinsic wave function upon the direction of the relative momentum of an off - mass - shell quark with respect to an on - mass - shell diquark allows one to construct an internal pure s - wave nucleon state , and therefore to investigate the nucleon ff s for a nucleon living in a well defined orbital angular momentum state .",
    "it is worth noting that the free propagation of three quarks is prevented by a suitable choice of the intrinsic wave function .",
    "the model has been further improved by adding a two - pion cut for a better description of the ff s at low @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ gross1 ] , the nucleon ff s , obtained through fitting procedures that take into account the dis as well , are shown .    within the hamiltonian light - front dynamics , where a meaningful fock expansion can be considered ,",
    "the pavia group has devised a cqm + `` meson - cloud '' approach ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) @xcite . in particular , the non valence term is described by configurations where a nucleon , or a delta , is coupled to @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 , with extended coupling constants modeled by phenomenological vertex functions .",
    "the momentum dependence of the nucleon and delta wave functions is chosen according to the brodsky - lepage prescription ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , while for the mesons a gaussian ansatz is adopted . in a frame where @xmath46 , only @xmath47 is necessary , and it is given by a sum of one - body currents for bare baryons and mesons .",
    "notably , in the chosen frame , @xmath47 is diagonal in the fock space . after determining i ) the two parameters in the pion wave function by fitting the corresponding ff ( for @xmath44 and @xmath45 the same momentum dependence",
    "is assumed ) and ii ) the cut - off constants in the extended coupling constants , according to the cloudy bag - model , one obtains the remaining 3 parameters by fitting the theoretical ff s , to 8 experimental values of proton and neutron at low @xmath3 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50,@xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that with no @xmath53-wave , one obtains @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a 1% @xmath53 component in the nucleon and delta wave functions has been also considered , in order to allow a better description of @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "[ pavia ] , the results show that the meson cloud is significant only for @xmath59 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a light - front analysis , already applied to sl and tl pion ff @xcite , has been extended to the nucleon ff s .",
    "the starting point is the mandelstam covariant expression for the matrix elements of the em current .",
    "it involves : i ) the dirac propagators of the quarks , ii ) the nucleon bethe - salpeter amplitude ( bsa ) , with a proper dirac structure and a scalar function describing the four - momenta dependence , iii ) the quark - photon vertex , to be modeled in order to take into account a microscopical vector meson dominance ( vmd ) contribution as well @xcite . after choosing a frame where @xmath60 ( in this frame , @xmath47 is _ not _ diagonal in the fock space ) , that allows one to deal with the sl and tl regions on the same footing",
    ", one can easily integrate on @xmath61 ( i.e. projecting onto the light front ) , if only the dirac poles are retained .",
    "it turns out that the different terms that naively one should expect from physical considerations , can be straightforwardly singled out ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in the sl region , besides the standard triangle contribution ( or valence term ) , one has a contribution produced by the pair creation ( non valence term or z - diagram term ) .",
    "this term involves both a bsa with two on - shell quarks , that can be related to the valence state , and a bsa with two off - shell quarks , leading to a non - valence term in a fock expansion of the nucleon state . in the tl region , there is only the pair contribution .",
    "the quark - photon vertex contains a bare contribution acting in the triangle term ( sl only ) and a contribution acting when the pair production is present , namely @xmath62 a bare term @xmath63 a vmd term , according to the decomposition of the photon state in bare , hadronic ( and leptonic ) contributions . the momentum dependence of the nucleon bsa in the valence sector has been approximated by a nucleon wave function a la brodsky - lepage ( i.e. , pqcd inspired ) @xcite with a quark mass @xmath64 and an overall power 7/2 .",
    "two parameters are present in the wave function , one is fixed through the anomalous magnetic moments of proton and neutron , ( @xmath65 = 2.878 , exp .",
    "2.793 , and @xmath66 = -1.859 , exp .",
    "-1.913 ) , and the other , @xmath67 , that controls the end - point behavior , by the overall fitting procedure ( see below ) . in the non valence sector",
    "the momentum dependence is approximated by @xmath68^{5/2}~g_{n\\bar 3}~{(k_1^+ + k_2^+ )   \\over   p^{\\prime + } _ n }     ~ \\left ( { p^+_n \\over k_{\\overline { 3}}^+ } \\right ) ^{{r}}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 is analogous to @xmath67 .",
    "a similar expression holds in the tl region .",
    "the four adjusted parameters , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 , are obtained from the fit of the sl ff s , ( even disregarding the proton ratio ! ) with a @xmath73 .",
    "the model , illustrated by figs .",
    "[ demelof1 ] and [ demelof2 ] , shows that in the sl region the possible zero in @xmath74 is due to the cancellation between the triangle term and the z - diagram contribution , generated by the higher fock components of the proton state .",
    "moreover , in the tl region one can see that for the proton some strength is lacking for @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( as for the pion @xcite ) , while the neutron remains a challenge .",
    "summarizing , lattice data are becoming more and more accurate , but unfortunately only the sl region can be studied , and for the time being in a limited range of @xmath77 .",
    "phenomenological models , that can address both sl an tl regions , appear still very appealing , and could contaminate each other , e.g. by supplying the analytic approaches with ingredients microscopically evaluated . in conclusion ,",
    "one has a set of tools , one fundamental and the others phenomenological , that can positively interact , allowing to gain a more deep insights in the analysis of the nucleon ff s , that represent an intriguing challenge for the theory , given the highly non perturbative nature of the physical quantities involved in the few - gev region .",
