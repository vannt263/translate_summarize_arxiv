    "lattice qcd studies of hadron - hadron interactions are the gateway to nuclear physics through first principles @xcite . from a lattice simulation point of view",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is probably the most challenging case .",
    "this is evident given the large spatial size of the deuteron , and in particular , the insight that the physics of the long - range strong interaction is driven mostly by the pion cloud @xcite .",
    "the latter may be taken as an indication that chiral symmetry and a full ( unquenched ) lattice action are high priorities for simulations aiming at quantitative results .    aside from the above prominent case , however , interactions in other two - hadron systems are worth investigating as well , because this might lead to new insights into the structural features of some of the experimentally known baryon resonances @xcite . in particular , we here ask if some of those may be understood as hadronic molecules , similar to the deuteron , but possibly with different physics of the interaction mechanisms in which quark and gluon degrees of freedom play a role .",
    "prime candidates for such systems are pairs of hadrons containing one heavy quark each because , in the spirit of the born - oppenheimer approximation , the ( slow ) heavy quarks naturally serve to define the centers of two hadrons while the ( fast ) light quarks and gluons provide the physics of the interaction .",
    "studies along those lines have been done before in the context of meson - meson and baryon - baryon systems @xcite .",
    "we here report on the current status of interaction studies of a heavy - light meson - baryon ( five - quark ) hadron with the quantum numbers of an s - wave @xmath0@xmath1 system .",
    "because the static approximation is employed for the heavy - quark propagator , the total energy can be computed as a function of the relative distance @xmath2 between the heavy quarks .",
    "thus an adiabatic ( born - oppenheimer ) potential @xmath3 is extracted .",
    "this can be used to address the possibility of molecule - like structures .",
    "two - hadron interpolating fields are constructed from standard local operators for the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 particles @xcite at relative distance @xmath6 and projected to total momentum zero @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the spatial lattice volume and @xmath9 is a dirac spinor index .",
    "then , with @xmath10 the correlation function @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the relative distance at the source , can be expressed in terms of fermion propagators .",
    "the flavor assignment @xmath13 causes the separable term to vanish .",
    "writing @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the heavy ( s ) and light ( u , d ) quark propagators , respectively , one obtains @xmath16\\\\ & & \\rule{3.7ex}{0ex } g(\\vec{y}t,\\vec{r}_1t_0 ) [ g(\\vec{y}t,\\vec{r}_1t_0)g(\\vec{y}+\\vec{r}_1t,\\vec{r}_1+\\vec{s}t_0 ) -g(\\vec{y}t,\\vec{r}_1+\\vec{s}t_0)g(\\vec{y}+\\vec{r}_1t,\\vec{r}_1t_0)]\\rangle\\ , .",

    "wilson fermions with hopping parameter @xmath18 this means that the propagator is taken in the limit @xmath19 , resulting in @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the product of @xmath22 link variables along a straight line from @xmath23 to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the distance @xmath25 is rather special @xcite because a color singlet operator , as realized by ( [ op2 ] ) , can also be achieved by a `` color twisted '' version of ( [ op2 ] ) where quarks in @xmath4 and @xmath5 are combined into a color singlet . because we do not consider color twisted operators in this work we restrict ourselves to non - zero relative distance .",
    "thus , because @xmath26 and @xmath27 , only the last two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] make a contribution to the correlation function for non - zero relative distance . by way of ( [ hstatic ] ) those diagrams in fig .",

    "we observe that sources at fixed spatial sites only are needed .",
    "however , an undesirable consequence of the static approximation is that the site sum @xmath31 has vanished from ( [ chg ] ) and thus is no longer working to improve statistics .",
    "the final correlator we use is extended from ( [ c ] ) to a matrix by employing several levels @xmath32 of operator smearing",
    ". the procedure amounts to replacing in ( [ op2 ] ) all light - quark fields @xmath33 with smeared fields @xmath34 .",
    "the computation of light - quark propagators thus requires various levels of smearing at the source and at the sink .",
    "we have used ape - style gauge field fuzzing @xcite and wuppertal fermion smearing @xcite with common values for the strength parameters @xmath35 and the number @xmath36 of iterations .",
    "no smearing , nor link variable fuzzing , was done for the heavy , static , quark fields in order to preserve spatial locality , i.e. the @xmath37 factor in ( [ hstatic ] ) .",
    "thus , writing @xmath38 $ ] , the correlator ( [ c ] ) becomes a @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 the expression for @xmath41 in terms of quark propagators still has the form given by ( [ c ] ) , however , light propagator elements are replaced with smeared ones , @xmath42 , with appropriate smearing levels at source and sink .",
    "the correlation matrix ( [ ckk ] ) is hermitian by construction .",
    "the lattice geometry is chosen as @xmath43 with bare lattice constants @xmath44 in the respective directions .",
    "this choice of an asymmetric and anisotropic lattice provides a fine mass resolution , in t - direction , and the same spatial resolution for the adiabatic potential , as the static sources are placed along the z - direction .",
    "the positions of the latter are at @xmath45 with @xmath46 , with @xmath47 in reference to ( [ c ] ) . in this way",
    "all possible relative distances @xmath48 in the range @xmath49 can be obtained .",
    "note that periodic boundary conditions , in the spatial directions , allow us to only utilize half of the extent of the lattice in z - direction .",
    "we have used the wilson plaquette action with wilson fermions in a quenched simulation .",
    "the gauge field couplings in the @xmath50-@xmath51 planes and the hopping parameters in directions @xmath50 are given by , respectively , @xmath52 the simulation was done at @xmath53 with four values @xmath54 of hopping parameters using a multiple mass solver @xcite .",
    "the correlation matrix ( [ ckk ] ) is constructed with three smearing levels , @xmath55 .",
    "it is then diagonalized separately on each timeslice @xmath56 , using singular value decomposition . for asymptotic @xmath56",
    "the largest eigenvalues correspond to the ground state of the two - hadron system .",
    "the maximum entropy method ( mem ) , as implemented in @xcite , is used to extract masses .    in order to set the physical mass scale",
    "the nucleon ( n ) and vector meson ( @xmath57 ) masses are fit to the model @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , using the four available hopping parameters . here",
    "@xmath60 is the common lattice constant in the @xmath61 and @xmath56 directions .",
    "the extrapolated values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as @xmath64 , are used to set the reduced mass of the @xmath65@xmath57 system to its experimental value @xmath66mev .",
    "this gives @xmath67fm ( @xmath68mev ) .    at the time of this writing",
    "the analysis is limited to 90 gauge configurations and to the largest value of the hopping parameter , @xmath69 .",
    "the corresponding results for the total energy @xmath70 are shown in fig .",
    "the uncertainties are the ( rms ) widths of the spectral peaks emerging from the mem analysis .",
    "due to periodic boundary conditions the data points replicate for @xmath71 . for a preliminary analysis we use the simple model @xmath72 the fit to the data",
    "is then made using the periodic replication @xmath73 of the model , which then has five parameters @xmath74 .",

    "as a first attempt to calculate phase shifts , we solve a standard non - relativistic scattering problem ( schrdinger equation ) employing the computed adiabatic potential @xmath76 with several values @xmath79 for the reduced mass .",
    "for the latter we use the ( experimental ) reduced masses of the systems @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath80@xmath81 , and @xmath82@xmath83 from @xcite .",

    "although in its present state the simulation is not conclusive , the results give a hint at potentially interesting physics .",
    "it appears conceivable that the known hadron mass spectrum may contain five - quark hadrons with a molecule - like structure .",

    "its mass lies just 40mev above the @xmath0@xmath1 threshold .",
    "however , we should caution that the extraction of masses typical for nuclear physics from a lattice simulation is difficult , because residual hadron - hadron interactions are , at least , one order of magnitude less that baryon rest masses . therefore , awaiting the analysis with a reasonable number of gauge configurations , the above scenario should be considered an interesting possibility ."
