    "quantum key distribution is the art of distilling a secret key between two distant parties , alice and bob , who have access to an untrusted quantum channel @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "one typically assumes that the equipment in alice and bob s labs can be trusted , and moreover , that its behavior is accurately described by a given theoretical model .",
    "unfortunately , this often turns out to be a very strong assumption which is not justified in practice @xcite .",
    "in particular , many loopholes can be exploited by an eavesdropper to get around the usual security proofs : for instance , the state preparation might be imperfect @xcite , or the eavesdropper might perform a blinding attack to take control of the detectors at a distance @xcite .    one way around such problems consists in exhaustively listing all the potential mismatches between the theoretical model and the real implementation and taking care of each one of them individually .",
    "however , this approach is dubious as it is impossible to be sure that all loopholes have really been addressed .",
    "another , more promising , approach is inspired by the recent framework of device - independent quantum information processing  @xcite . here",
    ", the idea is that if alice and bob are able to experimentally violate a bell inequality  @xcite , it means that their data exhibit intrinsic randomness as well as secrecy  @xcite , independently of the internal operation of the devices  @xcite . in the recent years",
    ", this framework has been used to prove the security of device - independent key distribution @xcite , to certify randomness expansion @xcite , self - testing of quantum computers @xcite and states  @xcite , and guarantee the presence of entanglement @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the cryptographic task of key distribution , which has been the subject of many very recent developments . until recently",
    ", security proofs were restricted to scenarios where alice and bob have access to a pair of memoryless devices or @xmath0 independent pairs of devices , thus ensuring that the measurements inside their own labs were causally disconnected  @xcite or commuting  @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the notion of collective attacks in standard qkd , where some independence assumption is required . ideally , one would like a protocol where only one device is required per party , and for which no assumption is needed for the device .",
    "this is indeed the motivation for doing device - independent cryptography in the first place .",
    "recent works have been able to get rid of this assumption . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors introduced a protocol based on the chained bell inequality @xcite and established its security against arbitrary adversaries .",
    "the protocol , however , only produces a single secret bit and does not tolerate any noise . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proved a strong converse of tsirelson s optimality result for the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) game , based on the chsh inequality  @xcite : the only way using quantum resources to win the game as predicted by tsirelson s bound is to use a strategy close to the optimal one for independent and identically distributed states , that is , applying the optimal measurements on copies of a two - qubit maximally entangled state .",
    "this theorem provides a security proof for diqkd based on the chsh inequality .",
    "unfortunately , the security proof does not resistant any constant amount of noise .",
    "while this work was completed , vazirani and vidick gave a universally composable security proof of diqkd against arbitrary attacks @xcite .",
    "their protocol , based again on the chsh inequality , is both reasonably efficient ( the key length scales linearly with the number of measurements ) and tolerant to a constant fraction of noise .",
    "a drawback , however , is that the maximum amount of noise tolerated is of the order of @xmath1 , significantly lower than the bounds obtained for protocols using @xmath0 pairs of devices .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present a security proof that ( i ) works for only two devices , that is , does not require commuting measurements or memoryless devices , ( ii ) can be applied to generic diqkd protocols based on arbitrary bell inequalities , ( iii ) has the same efficiency and tolerance to noise than previous proofs using memoryless devices .",
    "all these nice properties , however , come at the price of assuming that the adversary only holds classical information .",
    "while this may seem a strong requirement , it can be easily enforced in any realistic implementation by delaying the reconciliation process , since the best existing quantum memories have very short coherence times  @xcite .",
    "another advantage of our general framework is that it can also provide security beyond quantum theory , that is , against eavesdroppers that are only limited by the no - signalling principle .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "we first give a brief reminder of the relation between non locality , that is , violation of a bell inequality , and randomness .",
    "we then describe the quantum key distribution protocol and present its secret key rate .",
    "we prove the security of the protocol under the assumption that the eavesdropper does not have access to a long - term quantum memory .",
    "we conclude by briefly comparing our results with the existing security proofs , and discussing some rather natural follow - up questions .",
    "in the following , we consider a bipartite scenario where alice and bob input random variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 in their respective devices and obtain classical outputs @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we denote @xmath6 the sizes of the alphabets of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath8 the probability of getting the specific results @xmath9 when the inputs are @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the vector with components @xmath8 .",
    "a bell inequality can be written as @xmath12 : = \\sum_{a , b , x , y } \\beta ( a , b , x , y)\\ , p(a , b|x , y ) \\leq i_\\mathrm{cl}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the classical upper - bound . to any such bell inequality",

    "examples of bell inequalities satisfying this property are : the chsh inequality @xcite , the chained inequality @xcite , and the collins - gisin - linden - massar - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality @xcite . our results , however ,",
    "can easily be generalised to cover the case of input - dependent bounds .",
    "the diqkd protocol that we consider in this paper is very general in the sense that it is compatible with arbitrary bell inequalities , in particular with the various examples of bell inequalities mentioned above .",
    "our protocol consists of four steps : measurements , estimation of the bell violation , error correction and privacy amplification .",
    "we note @xmath0 the number of times each device is used during the protocol",
    ".    1 .   * measurements . *",
    "alice and bob respectively generate the random variables @xmath21 with distribution @xmath22 for @xmath23 . if @xmath24 then alice measures round @xmath25 with input @xmath26 obtaining outcome @xmath27 . if @xmath28 then alice generates @xmath29 with uniform distribution @xmath30 and measures round @xmath25 with input @xmath29 obtaining outcome @xmath27",
    "bob does the analog with @xmath31 , input @xmath32 , and outcome @xmath33 .",

    "the data corresponding to the rounds of the set @xmath42 is also published and used to estimate the bell - inequality violation .",
    "more specifically , alice and bob can use the public data to compute the following quantity : @xmath43 the data of the rounds not in @xmath44 constitutes the raw key of alice @xmath45 and bob @xmath46 .",
    "* error correction .",
    "* alice and bob publish @xmath47 bits in order to correct bobs errors @xmath48 . for sufficiently large @xmath47 , all errors are corrected @xmath49 with high probability .",
    "note that some of the published bits are used to estimate how many more bits need to be publish for a successful error correction . for large @xmath0 ,",
    "publishing @xmath50 bits is enough .",
    "for more details about the functioning of error correction , we refer to @xcite .",
    "* privacy amplification .",
    "* alice generates and publishes a two - universal  @xcite random function @xmath51 which maps @xmath52 to an @xmath53-bit string @xmath54 .",

    "alice and bob then compute @xmath58 , obtaining two copies of the secret key .",
    "note that if the adversary holds a quantum memory , but can not keep it for an arbitrary long time , the honest parties should implement the protocol in two steps : ( i ) they receive the quantum systems from the source and perform the measurements , ( ii ) some time @xmath59 later they perform the rest of the protocol involving the public communication for the estimation , error correction , and privacy amplification .",
    "we show security under the assumption that the adversary can not keep a quantum memory for a time @xmath59 . according to current and near - future technology",
    ", this assumption can be enforced by taking @xmath59 of the order of a few minutes  @xcite .",
    "to prove security , we will not make any assumption on the behaviour of the devices of alice and bob , except that they do not broadcast information about the inputs and outputs towards the adversary ( a condition without which there is no hope of ever establishing any secret ) .",
    "modulo this requirement , we can even assume for simplicity that the devices have been built by the adversary .",
    "the eavesdropper could in particular hold quantum systems that are entangled with the systems in the users devices .",
    "however , our proof of security only holds under the condition that the eavesdropper can not store this quantum information past the measurement step of the protocol .",
    "after this step , she should thus perform a measurement @xmath60 on his quantum system , which would give him some classical information @xmath61 about the behaviour of alice s and bob s devices .",
    "but since until this point no public communication has been exchanged between alice and bob , we can as well assume that the eavesdropper has performed his measurement before the users received their devices from the source .",
    "the fact that our proof of security holds independently of the behaviour of the devices , then implies that it holds independently of the prior classical information @xmath61 that eve holds on the devices , and we can thus forget @xmath61 in the following .    at the end of the protocol",

    "let @xmath66 be the probability distribution for these random variables .",
    "we say that @xmath62 is an ideal secret key if it is uniformly distributed and uncorrelated with all the rest : @xmath67 note that since @xmath44 and @xmath68 are functions of @xmath69 , so is @xmath53 .",
    "it is unrealistic to expect that a protocol can generate an ideal secret key .",
    "instead , what we demand is that the distribution generated by the above protocol is indistinguishable from an ideal secret key .",
    "it is known that the optimal success probability when discriminating the two distributions is @xcite @xmath70 the main result of this work ( see the theorem below ) is to shows that @xmath71 where @xmath57 is a constant and @xmath72 . for large @xmath0",
