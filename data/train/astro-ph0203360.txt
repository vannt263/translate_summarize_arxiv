    "optical spectroscopy of the ionized gas around galactic nuclei provides strong constraints on the excitation mechanisms .",
    "line ratio diagrams of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , such as those of @xcite , allow us to distinguish three major classes ; nuclei excited by starbursts , and the two types excited by a bona - fide active nucleus : the seyfert narrow line regions ( nlrs ) and extended narrow line regions ( enlrs ) , and the low excitation nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) .",
    "as far as the seyfert galaxies are concerned , the compilations of @xcite , veilleux(1991a , b , c ) , and @xcite show that the emission line ratios are remarkably uniform within a given object , and very similar ( with typically less than 0.5 dex variation ) from one object to another .",
    "the standard paradigm proposes that the nlr and the enlr are excited by photons originating at or near a compact nuclear source ( see , e.g. @xcite ) having a smooth featureless power - law , or broken power - law euv ionizing spectrum . within this model ,",
    "the clustering of the observed line ratios within such a restricted domain of parameter space presents a problem , since in such models the excitation is in large measure controlled by the ionization parameter , @xmath2 , and this is free to vary over a wide range .",
    "the implications of this is that there should exist photoionized regions with very high excitation corresponding to high @xmath2 , but objects such as these are missing in the @xcite diagnostic diagrams . instead , the constraints derived from the line ratio diagnostic diagrams imply that @xmath2 has a similar value in all nlrs .",
    "modelers have been therefore forced to make the arbitrary ( and possibly unphysical ) assumption that the gas density in the ionized clouds must fall exactly as the inverse square of the distance from the nucleus .",
    "one rather successful variation on the photoionization models is to assume that the power - law euv spectrum passes through a highly - ionized screen of diffuse gas , before being absorbed in the vicinity of dense ( much higher pressure ) clouds ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although such models produce generally good results when compared with observed ratios , these have the difficulty that the geometry of the ionized gas is ill - defined and necessarily becomes a new free parameter .",
    "these models can also be questioned on physical grounds , since the assumed pressure difference between the cloud and inter - cloud components is not explained .",
    "another variation is to consider the integrated emission from a whole family of photoionized clouds of different densities ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models can be made to fit the observed spectra quite well , but the geometry of the clouds and their relative contributions to the emission remain free parameters and are poorly constrained .    in any of these photoionized models , the ( often quite violent )",
    "internal dynamics of the enlr are not addressed .",
    "these include clear evidence of non - gravitational motion , and evidence for outflow at velocities up to ( or even in excess of 1000 km s@xmath3 ) ( _ eg _ @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it was results such as this that led @xcite to suggest that the nucleus ejects radio components that interact with ambient gas and replenish the high kinetic energy and ionization of the nlr .",
    "this led to the development of photoionization by fast radiative shocks , which generate a strong internal photoionizing radiation field ( @xcite , ( 1996 ) ) .",
    "this model is successful in reproducing the strong lines observed in many agn ( see review by @xcite ) . in addition , it can explain other features which simple photoionization models fail to address .",
    "for example , where the nlrs are spatially resolved , there often are found to be strong correlations between radio power and either line luminosity @xcite or line width @xcite .",
    "such correlations exist not only for seyfert galaxies , but persist up to much more luminous classes of radio galaxies .",
    "however , the fast shock model has its limitations .",
    "it has difficulty reproducing the very strong coronal lines of [ fe ] , [ fe ] , [ s ] , [ s ] , [ si ] or [ si ] ( @xcite ) which imply photoionization with very high local ionization parameters .",
    "these models also can not reproduce the large outflow velocities inferred in the [ o ] line in some objects such as ngc1068 ( e.g. @xcite ) . in shock models ,",
    "most of the [ o ] emission is expected to be generated in the photoionized precursor of the shock , which theoretically should be the undisturbed gas in the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the nlr lines of ( probably ) the majority of seyfert galaxies are quite narrow and consistent with line broadening due to galactic rotation rather than being produced in shocked outflows .    in this paper we argue that some of these properties can be explained in terms of radiation pressure dominated dusty photo - ablating clouds . in the past , dust has been considered in photoionization models both through its contribution via photoelectric heating ( e.g.  @xcite ) and as shielding component thanks to its large opacity in the fuv . however , the effects of dust photoelectric heating and of the radiation pressure on dust on both the ionization and hydrostatic structure of the nlr clouds has not been examined in a systematic fashion before . in the next section we detail these effects and",
    "show how these provide a natural explanation as to why the inferred nlr ionization parameter seems to be confined to the range @xmath4 . in ",
    "3 we describe the basics of our dusty , radiation pressure dominated models .",
    "these are compared with other types of photoionization models , allowing us to separately understand the effects of photoelectric heating and of radiation pressure on the emergent spectrum .",
    "the predictions of all these models are compared with observations of nlr of seyferts on some key emission line diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in  4 . in following papers",
    "we will investigate further the effects of different parameters on our radiation pressure dominated photoionization models and present a full hydrodynamical model exploring such structures .",
    "the effects of radiation pressure from line absorption have previously been considered in photoionization models of the emission line regions of agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is important in determining the internal density structure at large ionization parameter .",
    "the effect of dust within the enlr has also been considered previously ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the radiation pressure exerted by the ionizing source acting upon dust within the photoionized gas has usually not been accounted for by the standard photoionization models , with a few notable exceptions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the standard photoionization modelling assumes an isochoric ( or constant density ) structure within the ionized slab instead of an isobaric ( constant pressure ) structure .",
    "dust is important not only because of the radiation pressure acting upon it , but also because of the photoelectric heating which it produces in the photoionized plasma , and in the way it competes with the gas in absorbing the ionizing photons .",
    "however , all of this critically depends on whether dust can survive the either the strong euv radiation field , or the relatively energetic conditions characterizing the photoionized region . in the ionized plasma of the enlr ,",
    "grains are electrically charged , locking the motion of the dust to that of the ionized gas .",
    "both the ionized gas and the dust is likely to be streaming at roughly sonic velocities from ionization fronts located around photo - evaporating dense clouds located in the `` ionization cones '' of the agn .",
    "the problem of dust survival is therefore reduced to the question of whether it can survive for a time equal to its passage through the high - emissivity region near the cloud surface as discussed in  3 .",
    "our detailed photoionization models show that the average gas temperature is @xmath5k , at which the thermal sputtering of grains is negligible and incapable of destroying the grains in so short a timescale .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of radiative shocks in which gas temperatures reach @xmath6k and grain destruction by sputtering occurs on very short timescales ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , our models show that grain temperatures are too low for thermal evaporation of grains by quantum heating provided that the dust grains are large enough ( @xmath7 nm ) .",
    "a third potential dust destruction mechanism is that of coulomb explosion , in which the grain charging becomes large enough that the coulomb repulsion between the atoms composing the grain exceeds the atomic bond strength .",
    "according to our models this condition is met for grains smaller than about 10 nm when the ionization parameter is of order unity . in the models described here",
    "we have simply set the minimum grain radius equal to 10 nm to allow for the destruction of the smaller grains .",
    "we will return to the detailed physics of grain destruction processes in these environments in a future paper .    in nlr regions observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "the coronal lines appear remarkably strong as compared to h@xmath8 .",
    "the existence of such coronal gas requires that both the ionization parameter and the radiation pressure are very large ( @xcite ) .",
    "elements such as fe and si are normally largely sequestered in the grains .",
    "the strength of the coronal lines of these elements requires that in the coronal gas , at least , the dust has been largely destroyed .",
    "our model , as depicted in figure [ flow ] is therefore one of a dusty , radiation - pressure dominated region surrounding a photoevaporating molecular cloud , which in turn is surrounded by a coronal halo within which the dust has been largely destroyed . in this paper",
    ", we will consider only the emission spectrum generated by the dusty dense inner region near the stagnation point in the flow around the cloud .",
    "this will be the highest emissivity region in the flow , and it will be the region in which the radiation pressure gradient is matched by the gas pressure gradient , allowing us to construct static rather than dynamic photoionization models .",
    "consider @xmath9 , the ratio of the available pressure of ionizing radiation , @xmath10 , to the gas pressure at the irradiated photoionized surface of a photoevaporating cloud : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 the speed of light , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the hydrogen density and the electron temperature at the irradiated cloud surface ( indicated by a subscript zero elsewhere ) . we define @xmath16 to be the ionizing photon flux ( @xmath17s@xmath3 ) impinging at the surface such that @xmath18 is the canonical ionization parameter .",
    "@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the local average euv photon energy .    in hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", the gas pressure gradient must match the local radiative volume force exerted by photon absorption , and this force can be separated into its two components , the force acting on the gas through photoionization , and the component due to dust absorption ; @xmath21{\\frac{{\\varphi ( \\nu ) } } { { c}}}d\\nu \\label{eqnforce1 } \\end{align}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the local radiation flux at frequency @xmath23 , @xmath24 the number density of ion @xmath25 of atomic species @xmath26 , @xmath27 the corresponding photoionization cross section with threshold @xmath28 . in the dust absorption term , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the dust absorption cross section and scattering cross section respectively , normalized to the hydrogen density and @xmath31 is the mean scattering angle of the dust grains at this frequency .",
    "the boundary condition is given by @xmath32 , the pressure at the irradiated face .",
    "we can readily estimate a critical value of @xmath33 above which dust absorption dominates over the photoelectric absorption .",
    "for an equilibrium photoionized plasma , the absorption of ionizing photons in a slab is simply equal to the local recombination rate in the plasma : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the recombination rate to excited states of hydrogen .",
    "the absorption of ionizing photons by dust is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the effective dust opacity of order @xmath38 per h atom .",
    "dust absorption becomes relatively more important as the strength of the ionizing field increases , and dust becomes the dominant opacity in the plasma when : @xmath39 for a typical value of @xmath40 , the critical ionization parameter is @xmath41 .",
    "this value is closely related to that at which radiation pressure starts to dominate either the gas pressure or the dynamical acceleration of the plasma .",
    "if @xmath42 is the mean energy of the ionizing photons absorbed by gas , and @xmath43 is the mean energy of the ionizing absorbed by dust , equation ( [ eqnforce1 ] ) can be approximated by : @xmath44 \\label{eqnfaprx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , and the effective ionization parameter for the dust  absorbed photons @xmath46 .",
    "generally speaking , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 will be greater than unity .",
    "clearly , dust becomes the dominant term in this equation when : @xmath49 this expression is the same as equation ( [ udom1 ] ) except for the ratio @xmath50 , which is of order unity . in the typical ionization field expected around an agn , @xmath51and with a ` standard ' dust model with solar abundances , a @xcite ( mrn ) size distribution @xmath52 and a lower size cutoff of 10 nm , we estimate that this condition gives a critical ionization parameter @xmath53    if the ionization parameter into a static plane - parallel slab of ionized gas is increased above this critical value , then the radiation pressure gradient imposed as the euv radiation field is absorbed through the ionized slab will induce a corresponding local gas pressure gradient .",
    "thus , if the initial ( outer layer ) pressure of the ionized gas is @xmath32 and the radiation pressure in the euv field is @xmath54 then the gas pressure close to the ionization front is @xmath55 thus , at high ionization parameter , the pressure in the ionized gas close to the ionization front is _ determined _ by the externally imposed ionization parameter , @xmath56 and the _ local _ ionization parameter becomes independent of the initial ionization parameter . in this way",
    ", the emission line spectrum in the low- and intermediate- ionization species will become effectively independent of the external ionization parameter .",
    "this is the core of our explanation of why the emission line spectra of nlr are so similar one to another .",
    "while @xmath33 defines the ionization parameter at the face of the cloud , one can define a _",
    "mean _ ionization parameter @xmath57 where @xmath58 is simply the mean density , that is an emissivity averaged density using a weight @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath60 tends asymptotically towards a constant value in the limit of high @xmath33 .",
    "we have constructed static , plane - parallel , radiation - pressure dominated , dusty photoionization models using the code mappings  iii , which includes the implementation of eqn .",
    "( [ eqnforce1 ] ) to evaluate the local radiation pressure gradient and hence the local density gradient .",
    "mappings  iii  treats several of the properties of dust such as photoelectric heating , as described previously by @xcite .",
    "the dust model includes both silicaceous and carbonaceous grains with a mrn grain size distribution and uses the absorption and scattering data of @xcite ( using the more recent smoothed uv data for silicates)draine / dust / dust.diel.html ] .",
    "here we have chosen the simplest `` standard '' values for the input parameters .",
    "for example , the models all used the @xcite solar abundance set , with the depletion factors for each element given in table 1 .",

    ", we have run four families of models with increasing ionization parameter @xmath33 ( defined at the outer boundary of the ionized slab ) . in order of increasing physical sophistication ( and reality )",
    "these are :    \\1 .",
    "isochoric ( constant density ) dust - free models with heavy element abundances in the gas phase which match those of the models including dust .",
    "isobaric dust - free models .",
    "again these have gas - phase heavy element abundances matching the models with dust .",
    "these models are isobaric in the sense that the product @xmath61 is kept constant , but the radiation pressure is not explicitly included .",
    "isochoric dusty models .",
    "isobaric dusty models without radiation pressure .",
    "these provide a dusty comparison to the complete model which shows the difference that radiation pressure makes .",
    "complete isobaric dusty models , which include the effect of radiation pressure on the density structure of the ionized gas .    to avoid differential effects due to different electron density in the low - excitation cases , in all cases the initial density",
    "was adjusted so that the density of the region emitting in the [ s ] lines was maintained constant at about 550 @xmath62 to within 10% .",
    "this density was chosen to be typical of the electron densities inferred from the [ s ] @xmath63 ratio in the nlrs of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the models were terminated at a point where the gas temperature dropped rapidly to below 5000k and the emission in the optical forbidden lines is quenched .    generally in the literature",
    "we encounter only the first or the third of these sets of models . the profound difference in the internal structure of the isobaric dusty models including radiation pressure compared with a `` standard '' isochoric model",
    "is emphasized in fig .",
    "[ structure ] which shows the internal density and temperature structure produced in the dusty , radiation pressure dominated slab model with ionization parameter of @xmath64 in this model , the radiation pressure in the euv radiation field is roughly 30 times the initial gas pressure . at the `` front '' surface of the cloud the opacity of the cloud is entirely dominated by dust , and the photoelectric heating by dust is very large . as a consequence ,",
    "the electron temperature in this zone is very high , of order 25000k .",
    "the electron temperature decreases strongly throughout the model towards the ionization front , and this steepens the density gradient in the model .",
    "this strong density gradient which is set up between the high ionization and low ionization regions can provide a physical explanation of the pressure difference between these regions which was required in the @xmath65 models of @xcite .",
    "as expected , the pressure in the low - ionization region scales as the radiation pressure at high @xmath66 thus , the local ionization parameter characterizing the low and intermediate ionization region of the model becomes independent of @xmath66    the emission line ratios produced by the various classes of model can be quite different one from another .",
    "we have chosen to display here only those which provide a good separation between the different classes of model , and so have a diagnostic utility .",
    "any of the of line emission ratios used by @xcite will give such a separation .    in figure [ sii - oiii ]",
    "we plot one of these diagnostic diagrams , the [ s ] @xmath67 / h@xmath68 ratio @xmath69 the [ o ] @xmath70 / h@xmath8 ratio .",
    "the observational points are from @xcite . for the dust - free case , both the isochoric nor the isobaric sequence can reproduce the observed data , though the fit would be improved with a flatter spectral index .",
    "the closest fit is found in the region @xmath71 . as has been shown by many other authors , only a very restricted range of ionization parameter",
    "provides a reasonable fit .    for the dusty models , both the isochoric and isobaric sequences approach the region of the observed nlr at high ionization parameter .",
    "the dusty , radiation pressure affected isobaric model shows very slow variation in the line ratios with @xmath2 at high ionization parameter and these line ratios are in the region of interest .",
    "the dusty , isochoric models actually begin to head away from the observations as we increase in ionization parameter .",
    "figure  [ isobmodels ] is a close up of the region of interest , showing only isobaric models .",
    "in addition to the two isobaric models described above , a dusty , isobaric model without radiation pressure is included for comparison .",
    "this figure illustrates the self - regulating effect of the radiation pressure in producing nearly constant line ratios for @xmath72 .",
    "while the radiation pressure free case does reproduce the observed data quite well , it does so only for a small range of ionization parameter , @xmath73 .",
    "by @xmath74 the model has left the region in which the observations lie .",
    "the complete dusty models , which include the effects of radiation pressure , not only lie in the region of the observed data but also display line ratios which stagnate with respect to changes in @xmath2 , over a broad range of values .",
    "the implication of this is that , provided @xmath75 , a cloud of given density could be moved radially by a large amount without producing any appreciable change in its excitation state .",
    "such a behavior is frequently seen , and is interpreted in the `` classical '' photoionization models as indicating a constant ionization parameter .",
    "the conclusions derived from figure [ sii - oiii ] and [ isobmodels ] are reinforced when we replace the [ o ] line by the higher - excitation [ ne ] line .",
    "this is shown in figure [ sii - nev ] . now",
    "the range of acceptable models is appreciably reduced . from inspection of both figures [ sii - oiii ] and [ sii - nev ]",
    "we see that the dusty models that include radiation pressure provide acceptable solutions in the range @xmath76 the acceptable range of solutions for the dusty isochoric models is much more restricted ; @xmath77 and there are no really acceptable solutions for _ any _ dust - free model .",
    "this illustrates a major advantage of the radiation pressure dominated model in that it encompasses a wider range of ionization species than any simple isochoric or isobaric model .",
    "the reason for this is that as density increases inward , one is effectively spanning a very wide range in the local ionization parameter .",
    "furthermore , the extra heating provided by dust photoheating scales with @xmath33 and the higher electron temperatures enhance the intensities of the high ionization species in a way that the dust free models can not account for .",
    "this effect is further enhanced by dust absorption which strongly reduces the luminosity of the hydrogen recombination lines in the high ionization zone . at the same time",
    ", it enhances the he  @xmath78 / h@xmath8 ratio to values as high as 0.5 - 0.6 which is in better agreement with observation , and similar to the value obtained in the matter - bounded models of @xcite .",
    "if we look only at line ratios which are sensitive to the excitation , then dust - free models might seem to provide an acceptable fit .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ excitation ] which plots the [ o]/[o ] line ratio against the [ ne]/[ne ] ratio . here",
    "similar values of the ionization parameter produce very similar values of the [ ne]/[ne ] ratio , while the [ o]/[o ] line ratio is more strongly affected by the temperature in the [ o ] - emitting zone .",
    "note that , again the dusty models including radiation pressure provide acceptable solutions in the range @xmath76    the effect of photoelectric heating is best investigated in terms of the electron temperature in the [ o ] - emitting region .",
    "this is shown in figure [ temperature ] which plots the temperature sensitive [ o ] @xmath79/5007ratio against [ o ] @xmath70 / h@xmath80 for clarity we have omitted the isochoric models , since these largely overlap with the isobaric cases .",
    "the observed points are drawn from both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dust - free models are clearly much cooler than the dusty models and fail to reproduce the observed [ o ] temperatures for any ionization parameter .",
    "this is the famous `` temperature problem '' of nlr , and which was discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "photoelectric heating by dust , proposed as the solution to a similar problem occurring in planetary nebulae by @xcite seems to provide enough additional heating in nlr to bring the predicted electron temperatures into the observed range . once again , for dusty isobaric radiation - pressure dominated models , acceptable models for the [ o ] @xmath79/5007  ratio lie in the range @xmath76    a final major effect of the addition of dust in these models is to limit the h@xmath8 surface brightness as a consequence of the absorption of ionizing photons by dust .",
    "since dust absorption strongly dominates over the gas absorption in the regime of high ionization parameter , this limits the ionized column ( str@xmath81mgren column ) to a maximum value . for a fixed density or pressure in the region emitting the [ s ii ] lines , the surface brightness of the ionized zone in h@xmath8 saturates at a maximal value at high @xmath33 .",
    "by contrast , at low @xmath56 dust absorption is negligible compared with gas absorption , and the h@xmath8 flux scales with the ionization parameter .",
    "this behavior is shown in figure [ hbflux ] .",
    "if the [ s ii ] density is lowered , then , at at a given @xmath33 the h@xmath8 flux simply scales with the density in the low-@xmath33 regime .",
    "however , since the dust and the gas absorption terms have a different density dependence , at a given @xmath33 in the high-@xmath33 regime , a lowering of the density in the [ s ii ] zone leads to a greater fraction of the incident radiation field being absorbed by dust .",
    "the result of this is that the saturation value of the h@xmath8 surface brightness is reduced by a greater factor than simply the ratio of the densities .",
    "the roll - off between the low-@xmath33 and high-@xmath33 , regimes must therefore occur at a slightly lower value of @xmath33 than in the high density case .",
    "the plane - parallel models presented here strictly apply only along the ( stagnation ) line which lies directly towards the ionizing source on the front face of a photoevaporating cloud . towards the sides of the cloud",
    ", lateral motions will be developed in the ionized plasma by the transverse gas pressure gradient . around the cloud edges , the radiation pressure force acts radially outwards from the central engine . according to equation ( [ eqnforce1 ] ) , this drives an accelerating flow radially away from the central agn .",
    "such a radiatively - driven outflow was considered by @xcite in the context of the coronal gas . in the case of ngc  1068 ,",
    "new hst stis data presented by @xcite shows [ o ] tails of clouds about 100 pc out from the nucleus being accelerated up to 2000 km s@xmath3 or greater , over a distance of about 0.15 arc sec ( 10 pc ) .",
    "this corresponds to an acceleration of order @xmath82 cm  s@xmath83 .",
    "let us now examine whether this acceleration could be due to radiation pressure .    according to the observations of @xcite , the density given by the [ s ] lines in ngc 1068 is about 2500 @xmath84 in the high ionization parameter models ,",
    "this density is determined entirely by the radiative pressure , and such a pressure is obtained from a central source giving a surface luminosity of @xmath85 erg @xmath86 s@xmath3 at the outer boundary of the photoablating cloud .",
    "this figure is in excellent agreement with that inferred from the bolometric fir luminosity ( @xcite ) @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "this gives a flux at a distance of 70 pc from the nucleus ( typical for these clouds ) of about 1700 erg @xmath86 s@xmath89    if these radiative forces go into accelerating the gas in the ionized tails of the ngc1068 clouds , then from equation ( [ eqnfaprx ] ) we would require a flux of order @xmath90 erg @xmath17 s@xmath3 to provide the observed acceleration .",
    "the inferred flux is a factor ten lower than this , and this would produce a final outflow velocity of order 700 km s@xmath3 . the only way around this problem would be to increase the force per unit mass of gas by increasing opacity of the dust .",
    "this could be done through grain shattering , which according to @xcite will occur whenever grain - grain collision velocities are greater than the sound speed in the grain material , about 2 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this could be achieved with either subsonic turbulence in the gas , or else subsonic radiatively - driven grain drift velocities .    a potential mechanism for grain shattering is as follows .",
    "close to the ionization front , and within it , the net grain charge is negative , being dominated by collisions .",
    "when the grains are charged their motion is strongly coupled to the gas via coulomb interactions . as the grains are advected with the gas flow from the ionization front",
    ", the local radiation field becomes stronger and the charge on the grains becomes smaller as photoelectric charging becomes more important .",
    "eventually , the net charge on an individual grain becomes zero as the collisional and photoelectric charging exactly balance . at this point",
    "the grain can decouple from the gas flow and radiative pressure forces push it back towards the ionization front . the terminal drift velocity that the grain can reach",
    "is determined by the gas density , @xmath91 , and the radiation field intensity , @xmath92 ; @xmath93 . for the parameters computed for ngc 1068",
    "this could amount to @xmath94 @xmath95 . however , long before this velocity is reached , the grain will become charged once more , and the grain motion is again locked to the gas motion .",
    "thus , when their charge becomes zero , the grains will tend to oscillate about the position where this happens until another ( charged ) grain strikes and shatters them .",
    "the shattered fragments have their equilibrium point further out in the ionized flow , and of course they are much more vulnerable to the other grain destruction mechanisms we have mentioned . in our models for ngc",
    "1068 grains are completely shattered in the region which produces [ nev ] and [ fevii ] .",
    "the idea that the ionized tails of the cloudlets in ngc  1068 are driven by radiation pressure acting on the shattered dust seems a reasonable one , but it is clear that the full solution of this problem will require a hydrodynamic model which explicitly includes the grain physics and destruction processes .",
    "we intend to present such a model in a future paper .",
    "if dust is indeed destroyed at some point in the outflow , the gas will continue to flow outward from the cloud , but radiation pressure effects become relatively ineffective in determining the dynamics . in this case",
    "the cloud will become surrounded by a highly ionized coronal region with an equilibrium electron temperature of order @xmath96k . on the basis of continuity of pressure , we estimate that in the case of ngc1068 , the density of this region is @xmath97 @xmath62 and therefore that the effective ionization parameter is of order unity , or somewhat greater",
    ". this would be sufficient to explain the extreme degree of ionization observed in this coronal region ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , let us examine if the hypothesis that dust can be accelerated in the cometary tail of the cloud is also consistent with the hypothesis that dust can also be destroyed in entering the coronal region . from the acceleration in the tail ( @xmath82 cm  s@xmath83 ) and the length of the tail ( 10pc )",
    "we can estimate the transit time of material through the tail ; @xmath98yr . along the stagnation line in the direction of the source ,",
    "material flows off the cloud at about the sound speed , 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , the photoionization model for ngc 1068 shows that the thickness of the ionized zone is about @xmath99 cm .",
    "therefore , the dusty plasma flows through this region in about @xmath100yr .",
    "these timescale are quite comparable , which strongly suggests that the length of the [ o ] tails and the production of the coronal region in ngc 1068 are both moderated by the dust destruction , occurring on a timescale of order @xmath98yr .",
    "in this paper we propose that the nlr and enlr of seyfert galaxies can be self - consistently modelled by radiation - pressure dominated dusty photoionized regions surrounding photoablating dense clouds . by using the code mappings  iii ,",
    "we have shown that these display a strong density gradient increasing towards the ionization front , are characterized by strong photoelectric heating by the dust and in which the dominant absorption of the ionizing continuum is due to the dust . in these models ,",
    "the gas pressure close to the ionization front is determined by the radiation field .",
    "the models provide :    * a line spectrum consistent with the observations , and which remains approximately invariant against changes in @xmath33  that span a range larger than 2 orders of magnitude . * a higher electron temperature than can be achieved in standard photoionization models , and which could help explain the long standing `` temperature problem '' of nlr and enlr . *",
    "an h@xmath8 surface brightness which reaches a maximum value at high values of the initial ionization parameter @xmath33 .      * the co - existence of the low - ionization zones with a extremely high ionization parameter coronal region .",
    "* strong radial radiative acceleration of dusty gas which may explain the broad and blue - shifted [ o ] profiles seen in many seyfert galaxies .",
