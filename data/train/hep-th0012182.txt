    ", we obtain a domain wall@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these walls are typically codimension one and breaks half of the supersymmetry which is called a @xmath6 bps state .",

    "when these three half walls coexist , we can have only one common conserved supercharge @xmath96 .",
    "in fact we find that the domain wall junction configuration conserves precisely this single combination of supercharges , even though it has also another central charge @xmath16 contributing .",
    "correspondingly we obtain the bps equations ( [ be2 ] ) and ( [ be2vector ] ) for @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",

    "the vector superfields actually serve to constrain chiral superfields to have the identical magnitude pairwise through @xmath101 to satisfy the bps equation ( [ be2vector ] ) for vector superfields : @xmath108 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "let us examine states on the background of a domain wall junction from the point of view of surviving symmetry . in the case of the bps states satisfying the bps equation ( [ be2 ] ) corresponding to @xmath98 ,",

    "then the massless right - moving state @xmath126 is a singlet representation .",
    "this singlet state can either be boson or fermion .",
    "thus we find that there are only two types of representations of the @xmath4 supersymmetry algebra , doublet and singlet .",
    "we also find that massive modes should appear in pairs of boson and fermion , whereas the massless right - moving mode can appear singly without accompanying a state with opposite statistics .",

    "( [ be2 ] ) , we have @xmath127 supersymmetry and the left - moving massless states can appear as singlets .",
    "since the vector superfields have no nontrivial field configurations , nambu - goldstone modes have no component of vector superfield . moreover we can replace our model , if we wish , by another model with purely chiral superfields without spoiling the essential features including the solvability . consequently we shall neglect vector superfields and consider the general wess - zumino model in eq.([generalwzmodel ] ) in the following . for simplicity",

    "since we are usually most interested in a low energy effective field theory , we wish to study massless modes here .",

    "we can construct a linear combination of the nambu - goldstone fermions to have no support along one out of the three walls .",
    "however , no linear combination of these nambu - goldstone fermions can be formed which does not have support extended along any of the wall .",
    "therefore these wave functions are not localized and are not normalizable .",

    "the following observation is behind this assertion .",
    "a single domain wall breaks only a half of supercharges .",
    "nonparallel wall also breaks half of supercharges , some of which may be linear combinations of the supercharges already broken by the first wall .",
    "if the junction configuration is a @xmath7 bps state , linearly independent ones among these two sets of broken supercharges of nonparallel walls become @xmath199 of the original supercharges .    to see in more detail ,",
    "let us first note that the junction configuration reduces asymptotically to a wall if one goes along the wall , say the wall @xmath90 .",
    "let us denote the number of original supercharges to be @xmath200 . on the first wall , a half of the original supersymmetry ( @xmath201 ) is broken .",
    "we call these broken supercharges as @xmath202 .",
    "consequently we have nambu - goldstone fermions localized around the core of the wall and is constant along the wall . in the junction configuration , we have other walls which are not parallel to the first wall .",
    "asymptotically far away along one of such walls , say wall @xmath203 , another half of the supersymmetry @xmath204 is broken .",
    "if the junction is a @xmath7 bps state , a half of these , say @xmath205 , is a linear combination of @xmath202 broken already on the wall @xmath90 . the other half , @xmath206 are unbroken on the wall @xmath90 .",
    "altogether a quarter of the original supercharges remain unbroken .",
    "consequently the nambu - goldstone fermions corresponding to @xmath205 have a wave function which extends to infinity and approaches a constant profile along both the walls @xmath90 and @xmath203 .",
    "those modes corresponding to @xmath206 have support only along the wall @xmath203 , and those corresponding to the linear combinations of @xmath202 orthogonal to @xmath205 have support only along the wall @xmath90 .",
    "thus we find that any linear combinations of the nambu - goldstone fermions have to be infinitely extended along at least one of the walls which form the junction configuration .",
    "therefore the nambu - goldstone fermions associated with the coexistence of nonparallel domain walls are not localized at the junction and are not normalizable .    in our exact solution",
    ", domain wall junction configuration reduces asymptotically to the wall @xmath90 at @xmath207 with fixed @xmath35 . on the wall , only two supercharges in eqs.([eq : brokencharges1]) ( [ eq : brokencharges ] )",

    "the other broken supercharge is @xmath212 on the wall 2 and @xmath213 on the wall @xmath92 .",
    "there are only two independent supercharges among @xmath214 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 .",
    "together with @xmath211 we obtain three independent broken supercharges .",
    "we can construct a linear combination of the nambu - goldstone fermions to have no support along one out of the three walls . however , any linear combination has nonvanishing wave function which becomes fermion zero mode on at least one of the wall asymptotically .",
    "therefore the associated nambu - goldstone fermions have support which is infinitely extended at least along two of the walls .    if a single wall is present , we can explicitly construct a plane wave solution propagating along the wall , which may be called a spin wave and is among massive modes on the wall background .",
    "even if there are several walls forming a junction configuration , we can consider excitation modes which reduce to the spin wave modes along each wall .",
    "they should be a massive mode on the domain wall junction background .",
    "the nambu - goldstone mode on the domain wall junction is the zero wave number limit of such a spin wave mode .",
    "this physical consideration suggests that the massless nambu - goldstone fermion is precisely the vanishing wave number ( along the wall ) limit of the massive spin wave mode .",
    "let us note that our argument does not apply to models with the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "in such models , massless graviton is localized on the background of intersection of walls@xcite . in that case ,",
    "massless mode is a distinct mode different from the massless limit of the massive continuum , although the massless mode is buried at the tip of the continuum of massive modes .",
    "the normalizability of the massless graviton is guaranteed by the anti de sitter geometry away from the junction or intersection including the direction along the wall .",
    "next we discuss the sign of the contribution of the central charge @xmath215 to the mass of the junction configuration .",

    "only complex fields can contribute to @xmath215 .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that there is only one field which can contribute to @xmath215 as in our exact solution .",
    "eq.([y - area - generic ] ) shows that the central charge @xmath215 becomes negative ( positive ) , if the asymptotic counterclockwise contour in @xmath154 is mapped into a counterclockwise ( clockwise ) contour in field space . on the other hand ,",
    "the sign of the contribution of the central charge @xmath215 to the mass of the junction configurtion is determined by the formula , @xmath219 or @xmath220 @xmath221 .",
    "the choice of these mass formulas are in turn deterined by the map of the asymptotic counterclockwise contour in @xmath154 space to a counterclockwise or clockwise contour in the superpotential space @xmath19 . combining these two observations ,",
    "we conclude that the contribution of the central charge @xmath215 to the mass of the junction configuration is negative if the sign of rotations is the same in field space @xmath25 and in superpotential space @xmath19 , and positive if the sign of rotations is opposite .",
    "the field configuration moves counterclockwise in field space in our exact solution in ( [ exact solution ] ) and then the central charge is negative in this solution .",
    "since the exact solution satisfies the bps equation for the case @xmath69 , the central charge contributes to the mass of the junction configuration negatively .",
    "therefore we should not consider the central charge @xmath215 alone as the physical mass of the junction at the center . in the junction configuration",
    ", the junction at the center can not be separated from the walls .",
    "we also can find a solution for the other case of @xmath55 in our model .",
    "the solution is just a configuration obtained by a reflection @xmath222 .",
    "then the central charge is positive , but the contribution to the mass @xmath55 becomes again negative . in either solution , the rotation in field @xmath223 space has the same sign as the rotation in superpotential @xmath19 space . therefore central charge",
    "@xmath215 contributes negatively to the mass of the junction , irrespective of the choice of @xmath224 or @xmath98 .",
    "more recently this feature of negative contribution of @xmath215 to the junction mass is studied from a different viewpoint and it is argued that this feature is valid in most situations except possibly in contrived models@xcite .",

    "we find that the new central charge @xmath16 associated with the junction gives a negative contribution to the mass of the domain wall junction , whereas the central charge @xmath8 gives a dominant positive contribution .",
