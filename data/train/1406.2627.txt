    "the electronic behavior of graphene has been the focus of a great amount of work since its isolation in 2004 @xcite .",
    "graphene has an outstanding mobility at room temperature , being an excellent metallic material at the nanoscale . since its charge carriers behave as chiral massless dirac fermions , it is not possible to confine them by purely electrostatic means , so other strategies , such as employing bilayer graphene @xcite , have to be considered for nanoelectronic applications , for which gapped materials are needed to fabricate transistors and logic gates .",
    "the difficulty to confine charge carriers in graphene has a fundamental origin : klein tunneling was predicted to occur in monolayer graphene @xcite , and it was subsequently detected in transport experiments @xcite . devising alternative ways to confine massless fermions is therefore a relevant topic in graphene research .",
    "one possible way to attain localized states in graphene is by means of bound states in the continuum ( bics ) .",
    "the remarkable advances in the fabrication of graphene nanoribbons and experiments in which their electronic properties are tuned by applied external potentials , suggest that bics could be observed in graphene structures .",
    "bound states in the continuum were first predicted by von neumann and wigner in 1929 , who constructed a potential that yielded a truly localized , square - integrable state completely embedded in a continuum @xcite . since then , a great number of theoretical works have explored the feasibility of bics in diverse setups .",
    "in fact , they have been predicted to occur in atomic and molecular systems @xcite , as well as in mesoscopic structures @xcite .",
    "systems with quantum dots can be exploited to produce bics in low - dimensional structures @xcite .",
    "the formation of bics is a result of the interference of resonant states via the continuum .",
    "several mechanisms can give rise to these bound states : they can appear due to symmetry effects @xcite , so the difference of parity between discrete states and the continuum prevents their coupling . another mechanism",
    "takes into account a nonzero coupling between quasi - bound states and the continuum , so bics might be the result of a destructive interference process of resonant states for certain values of the physical parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "finally , a third mechanism is based in the fabry - perot interferometer , of application to photonic systems @xcite .",
    "as the physics of bics relies on interference , it is not limited to quantum systems .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "ballistic transport through a quantum dot was studied , demonstrating the possibility of a classical analogue of bics .",
    "furthermore , exploiting the analogy between electronics and photonics , several proposals have predicted bics in photonic materials @xcite . and",
    "time - dependent fields can be employed to achieve such localized states , as it has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "there is only one experimental work reporting the measurement of bics ; remarkably , it has been achieved in a photonic system @xcite .",

    "@xcite of an electronic state above the barrier of a semiconductor heterostructure was considered by other authors to be a bic , but in fact it turned out to lie in a minigap of the superlattice @xcite .",
    "thus , for the time being , no observation of a bound state in the continuum has been achieved for electronic systems .",
    "indeed , bics are considered to be fragile states , difficult to construct and detect experimentally @xcite .",
    "therefore , the search of electronic systems which could reveal the existence of robust bics with unambiguous features is an important field of research . as discussed above , one possibility for detection of bic is to employ graphene - based devices .    in this work",
    "we show that bics can be detected in graphene trilayer systems .",
    "our findings indicate that this nanostructure is an excellent candidate to observe bound states in the continuum by combining the measurement of the ldos and the conductance through the system as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "this gate potential produces the coupling of the bic to the continuum , so the ldos at the bic energy will be reduced for increasing values of the gate potential ; however , we find that this coupling yields a maximum of the transmission through the system that persists for large gate voltages . thus , the combination of ldos and transport measurements provides a way to identify bics in electronic systems .    in section ii of the paper",
    "we describe the tight - binding model employed to calculate the electronic properties of the trilayer graphene structure .",
    "in section iii we show an analytical approach to find the transmission probability by modeling the trilayer as three coupled 1d chains . in section",
    "iv we present results for the ldos and the conductance as a function of a gate voltage and discuss the formation of bound states in the continuum . finally , section v summarizes our main results .",

    "[ fig1 ] . this structure can be alternatively viewed as an infinite armchair nanoribbon with two flakes placed symmetrically above and below it .",
    "note that , although bernal ( ab ) stacking is more stable for graphite , the direct or aa stacking has been experimentally found in few - layer graphene @xcite .",
    "we choose the direct stacking because the aaa - stacked system can be easily mapped into a one - dimensional chain with two hoppings , yielding analytical expressions of the transmission that perfectly fit the conductance obtained numerically _ in the first transmission channel _ , as we later show in this paper .",
    "the widths considered correspond to metallic armchair nanoribbons , which play the role of contacts in this system .",
