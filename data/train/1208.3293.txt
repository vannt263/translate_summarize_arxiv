    "there is a large rapidity gap between jets , @xmath6 , which requires large c.m .",
    "energy of the proton collisions , @xmath7 . in the perturbative qcd description of the process",
    ", the hard scale is provided by the jet transverse momenta , @xmath8 ; moreover , we neglect power - suppressed contributions @xmath9 , thus allowing the use of leading - twist pdfs , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we still need to resum the qcd perturbative series , according to dglap  @xcite , @xmath12 and bfkl  @xcite , @xmath13 .",
    "mueller and navelet  @xcite proposed that , for @xmath14 , the bfkl approach is more adequate and leads to a _",
    "faster _ energy dependence and more decorrelation in the relative jet azimuthal angle @xmath15 .    in the bfkl approach ,",
    "valid in the regge limit @xmath16 , the total cross section of a hard process @xmath17 , via the optical theorem , @xmath18 , can be written as the convolution of the green s function of two interacting reggeized gluons and of the impact factors of the colliding particles .",
    "this is valid both in the lla ( resummation of all terms @xmath19 ) and in the nla ( resummation of all terms @xmath20 ) . in formulae ,",
    "@xmath21 the green s function is process - independent and is determined through the bfkl equation , @xmath22 whereas impact factors are process - dependent and only very few of them have been calculated in the nla . for the process under consideration ,",
    "the starting point is provided by the impact factors for colliding partons  @xcite ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in the lla one needs leading - order ( lo ) impact factors , which take contribution only from a one - particle intermediate state in the parton - reggeon collision ; in the nla one needs next - to - lo ( nlo ) impact factors , which take contributions from virtual corrections ( one - particle intermediate states ) and real particle production ( two - particle intermediate states ) .",
    "the steps to get the quark(gluon ) jet vertex from the quark(gluon ) parton impact factor are : ( 1 ) _ open _ one of the integrations over the phase space of the intermediate state to _ allow _ one parton to generate the jet , ( 2 ) take the convolution with pdfs , @xmath23 , ( 3 ) project onto the eigenfunctions of the lo bfkl kernel , i.e. transfer to the @xmath24-representation @xmath25 the nlo jet vertices have been calculated in the transverse momentum space ( no step ( 3 ) ) in  @xcite and cross - checked in  @xcite .",
    "they are given by complicated expression , to be transferred numerically to the @xmath24-representation , as it was done in  @xcite , where they were used to study mueller - navelet jets in the nla with lhc kinematics .",
    "here we want to sketch the derivation of an approximated expression for jet vertices , valid for jets with small aperture of the cone in the pseudorapidity - azimuthal angle plane .",
    "the details of the calculation are given in  @xcite .",
    "in the lo we have a one - particle intermediate state and the kinematics of the produced parton @xmath26 is completely fixed by the jet kinematics ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "r0.2     in the nlo , when real corrections are considered , we have two - particle intermediate states .",
    "then , we can have the following cases : ( i ) the parton @xmath26 generates the jet , while the parton @xmath27 can have arbitrary kinematics , provided that it lies _ outside _ the jet cone ; ( ii ) similarly with @xmath28 ; ( iii ) the two partons @xmath26 and @xmath27 both generate the jet ( see fig .",
    "4(left ) ) .",
    "the case in which one parton ( say @xmath26 ) generates the jet and the other parton is outside the jet cone can also be written as the contribution when the parton @xmath26 is produced with the same jet kinematics while the parton @xmath27 can have any kinematics ( _ inclusive _ jet production by the parton @xmath26 ) _ minus _ the contribution when the parton @xmath27 lies _ inside _ the jet cone ( see fig .",
    "4(right ) ) .",
    "the sca  @xcite means that all cones which appear in the jet definition given above are to be taken with aperture ( in the pseudorapidity - azimuthal angle plane ) smaller than a fixed value @xmath29 . for @xmath30 , very good agreement between sca and monte carlo calculations",
    "was found for cone sizes up to @xmath31  @xcite .         for the jet vertex in the lla",
    "the starting point is given by the _ inclusive _ lo parton impact factors , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then we have to _ open _ the integration over the one - particle intermediate state , i.e. introduce suitable delta functions , and take the convolution with the pdfs , getting ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the jet kinematic variables ) @xmath36 this expression can be used to construct the collinear and qcd coupling counterterms in the nla , arising when the renormalization of the pdfs and of the qcd coupling are taken into account .",
    "for the jet vertex in the nla , we separate the cases of quark- and gluon - iniziated subprocesses . for incoming quark , we have the following contributions : ( a ) virtual corrections , ( b ) real corrections from the quark - gluon state .",
    "the contribution ( b ) can be separated into the following pieces : ( b@xmath37 ) both quark and gluon generate the jet , ( b@xmath38 ) gluon _ inclusive _ jet generation minus gluon _ inclusive _ jet generation with the quark in the jet cone , ( b@xmath39 ) quark _ inclusive _ jet generation minus quark _ inclusive _ jet generation with the gluon in the jet cone . for incoming gluon , we have the following contributions : ( a ) virtual corrections , ( b ) real corrections from quark - antiquark state , ( c ) real corrections from two - gluon state .",
    "the contribution ( b ) can be separated into the following pieces : ( b@xmath37 ) both quark and antiquark generate the jet , ( b@xmath38 ) ( anti)quark _ inclusive _ jet generation minus ( anti)quark _ inclusive _ jet generation with the antiquark(quark ) in the jet cone .",
    "the contribution ( c ) can be separated into the following pieces : ( c@xmath37 ) both gluons generate the jet , ( c@xmath38 ) gluon _ inclusive _ jet generation minus gluon _ inclusive _ jet generation with the other gluon in the jet cone .",
    "the final result for the jet vertex ( see  @xcite ) in the @xmath24-representation is free of ir and uv divergences and is of the form @xmath40 , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the nlo vertex for the forward production of a high-@xmath0 jet from an incoming quark or gluon , emitted by a proton , has been calculated in the sca .",
    "the result has been presented in the so called @xmath24-representation , which turns to be very convenient for numerical implementation , as discussed in  @xcite . besides mueller - navelet jets ,",
    "the vertex can be used also for forward - jet electroproduction , @xmath41 , in combination with the nlo photon impact factor  @xcite .",
