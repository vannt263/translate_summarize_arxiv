    "\\(iv ) the dependence of the various parameterizations of the isovector form factors on the @xmath16 distribution in the case of charged current quasielastic lepton production process and n-@xmath1 transition form factors in the case of charged current 1@xmath214(1@xmath222 ) production process induced by neutrino(antineutrino ) in @xmath248o has been studied . for the quasielastic process results",
    "have been presented with the parameterizations given by budd et al .",
    "@xcite , bradford et al .",
    "@xcite , bosted et al .",
    "@xcite and alberico et al .",
    "we find that the use of various parametrization for the isovector form factor in the case of charged current quasielastic lepton production process results in a very small change in the peak region of @xmath16 .    in the case of",
    "incoherent one pion production process these results are obtained by using the n-@xmath1 transition form factor parameterizations given by lalakulich et al .",
    "@xcite , paschos et al .",
    "@xcite and schreiner et al .",
    "we find that in the case of neutrino induced pion production process the differential cross section obtained by paschos et al .",
    "@xcite and schreiner et al .",
    "@xcite is smaller in the region of low q@xmath169 , which increases by small amount for q@xmath169=0.2 - 0.4gev@xmath169 , than the cross section calculated with lalakulich et al .",
    "@xcite parameterization . in the case of antineutrino",
    "induced process there is very small change in the @xmath16 distribution .",
    "\\(v ) nuclear medium effects play an important role in reducing the number of events obtained by integrating @xmath9 over the atmospheric neutrino flux . in the case of @xmath309 induced quasielastic lepton production",
    "the reduction is around @xmath310 when the events are calculated in the local fermi gas model without the rpa effects and a total reduction of around @xmath311 when rpa effects are also taken into account in comparison to the lepton events calculated for the free case .",
    "in the case of inelastic lepton production the reduction from the events calculated without medium effects is around @xmath312 in the case of incoherent pion production and around 85@xmath133 in the case of coherent pion production , which results in a net reduction of around 50@xmath133 when nuclear medium and final state interaction effects are taken into account .",
    "the lepton events from the inelastic process also contribute to the quasielastic events even when there are no pions in the final state because of its absorption while coming out of the nucleus .",
    "such quasielastic like events contribute around 12@xmath133 to the total quasielastic lepton events .",
    "we find that for the total lepton events obtained by integrating the total cross section cross section(@xmath9 ) over the atmospheric neutrino flux results in a large reduction in the event rates when rpa effects are taken into account . therefore , the results with nuclear medium effects for muon and electron events may be important in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the future neutrino oscillation experiments to be performed at superk on the atmospheric neutrino or the accelerator neutrinos like t2k and no@xmath313a , the study of nuclear medium effects in predicting the event rates would play a very important role .",
