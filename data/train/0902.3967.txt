    "remarkably , in the presence of an electric field gradient along @xmath2 , an exciton flux oscillates back and forth between the two traps , with frequency @xmath66 .",
    "as an exciton goes through the barrier , it exchanges with the field the dipole energy acquired or lost in the tunneling process .",
    "the analogy with the ac josephson effect for superconductors is clear : in that case a bias voltage @xmath67 is applied across the junction , and the energy @xmath68 is exchanged between field and cooper pairs , as the latter experience a potential difference of @xmath67 when penetrating the potential barrier .",
    "this case concerns small oscillations around the equilibrium position @xmath69 .",

    "since @xmath75 is an average , the temporal inhomogeneous effect will blur the interference fringes , i.e. , @xmath95 .",

    "the most immediate caveat is that the exciton condensates in decoupled traps must acquire a relative phase if initially they condense separately without a definite phase relation .",
    "this scenario is analogous to the case of interference between independent laser sources first discussed by glauber @xcite and later studied experimentally for matter waves.@xcite even though a one - shot measurement with sufficient resolution would display fringes , the relative phase @xmath88 is also subject to intrinsic dephasing effects by quantum fluctuations.@xcite the latter are significant noise sources which affect @xmath0 , when @xmath50 and @xmath71 are quantized into canonically conjugated quantum variables whereas in the gp theory used so far they were classical variables whose fluctuations where neglected .    in the following , we quantize hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in order to properly evaluate @xmath97}\\right>$ ] as a quantum statistical average in finite traps .",
