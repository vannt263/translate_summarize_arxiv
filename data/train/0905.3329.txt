    "the rhic data on collective expansion dynamics of the quark - gluon plasma can be described by the relativistic hydrodynamics applied to a system with very large initial pressure gradients  @xcite . according to these data , particles of different mass are emitted from the quark - gluon - plasma fireball with a common fluid velocity , that is a signature of a hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "due to a large elliptic flow in noncentral collisions  @xcite , an agreement between the experimental data  @xcite and the predictions of relativistic hydrodynamics can only be reached when the flow of the qgp - fluid is treated as almost non - viscous .",
    "this leads to an indication that , in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition , the quark - gluon plasma produced in the rhic experiments behaves more like an ideal quantum liquid rather than a weakly interacting gas .",
    "the mean free path @xmath2 of a parton , which traverses such a liquid , is much smaller than the inter - particle distance , which is of the order of the inverse temperature @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "one can consider for comparison a weakly interacting dilute - gas model of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "there @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 standing for the particle - number density and the coulomb transport cross section , respectively . using the standard estimates @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the perturbative finite - temperature qcd coupling , one obtains @xmath11 , that strongly contradicts the above - mentioned experimental results .",
    "one can check  @xcite that these results could have only been reproduced by the dilute - gas model if the perturbative transport cross section , @xmath7 , were larger by an order of magnitude .",
    "this inconsistency of the weakly interacting quark - gluon plasma with the rhic data initiated recent calculations of kinetic coefficients in the _ strongly _ interacting relativistic plasmas .    among these coefficients , the one",
    "whose values define whether the plasma can be considered as weakly or strongly interacting is the shear viscosity @xmath12 .",
    "it is related to the above @xmath13-ratio via the estimate @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the entropy density . according to this relation ,",
    "the shear - viscosity to the entropy - density ratio , @xmath16 , becomes smaller when the plasma interacts stronger .",
    "for instance , for @xmath17 and the estimated typical mean free path @xmath18 , one has @xmath19 . on the other hand , since the mean momentum change @xmath20 of a parton , which propagates through the plasma over the distance @xmath2 , is of the order of @xmath21 , the heisenberg uncertainty principle forbids the ratio @xmath22 ( and therefore also @xmath16 ) to be vanishingly small .",
    "up to now , the minimal value of @xmath23 for the shear - viscosity to the entropy - density ratio has been found in @xmath1 sym theory  @xcite .",
    "it is thus challenging to find other qcd - motivated models where this ratio would be that small .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated  @xcite that such low values of the @xmath24-ratio can take place even in the perturbative ym plasma , due to the bremsstrahlung @xmath25 processes . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been argued , though , that the perturbatively calculated collisional viscosity is anyhow larger ( and therefore subdominant ) compared to the so - called anomalous viscosity , which is generated by plasma instabilities .    in this paper , we calculate the @xmath24-ratio in the gluon plasma of su(3 ) ym theory nonperturbatively .",
    "we obtain the shear viscosity from the kubo formula , which relates the corresponding spectral density @xmath26 to the euclidean correlation function of the @xmath27-component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath28 .",

    "this model generalizes qcd sum rules by assuming the existence of not only the gluon condensate @xmath29 but also of the finite vacuum correlation length @xmath30 .",
    "this assumption is justified by the lattice results on the exponential fall - off at large distances of the two - point correlation function of gluonic field strengths  @xcite , @xmath31 . by virtue of this finding",
    ", the model manages to quantitatively describe confinement ; for instance , the string tension reads @xmath32 .    below we will use a finite - temperature generalization of the stochastic vacuum model , accessible by implementing the euclidean periodicity of the @xmath33-coordinate . in the deconfinement phase of interest ,",
    "such a generalization yields for the spatial string tension @xmath34 a formula  @xcite pretty similar to its above - quoted vacuum counterpart .",
    "this formula reads @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the correlation length of the chromo - magnetic vacuum , and @xmath37 is the chromo - magnetic gluon condensate , which survives the deconfinement phase transition . the temperature dependence of the two main ingredients of the model , @xmath38 and @xmath37 , can be extracted from the results of the lattice simulations  @xcite .    since @xmath39 , one",
    "a  priori _ expects from the kubo formula , where the @xmath40-correlator enters , that the shear viscosity @xmath41 .",
    "this is a general prediction of the stochastic vacuum model for all the kinetic coefficients , for example for the jet quenching parameter  @xcite .",
    "in fact , according to the kubo formula , all the kinetic coefficients are proportional to the total scattering cross section of the propagating parton , which itself is proportional to @xmath42 in this model  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "since the shear viscosity has the dimensionality of [ mass]@xmath43 , one can on entirely dimensional grounds expect for it the following result : @xmath44 at temperatures larger than the temperature of dimensional reduction , @xmath45 , @xmath38 and @xmath42 are proportional to the corresponding power of the only dimensionful parameter present in the ym action at such temperatures , @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 on the other hand , the entropy density @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 in this paper , we quantitatively answer the naturally arising question of whether or not this function manages to get below the @xmath50-threshold at temperatures @xmath51 , which are accessible experimentally and on the lattice .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  ii , by assuming an exponential fall - off for the two - point correlation function of the energy - momentum tensors @xmath40 , we obtain from the kubo formula an integral equation for the spectral density @xmath26 of @xmath12 . in section  iii , by using for @xmath26 a lorentzian - type _ ansatz _ , with the same correlation length as that of @xmath40 , we explore this equation for the cases of large and small @xmath52 s , where @xmath53 is the number of a matsubara mode . the solution in the large-@xmath52 limit",

    "<S> shear viscosity of the gluon plasma in su(3 ) ym theory is calculated nonperturbatively , within the stochastic vacuum model . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density , proportional to the squared chromo - magnetic gluon condensate and the fifth power of the correlation length of the chromo - magnetic vacuum , falls off with the increase of temperature . at temperatures larger than the deconfinement critical temperature by a factor of 2 , this fall - off is determined by the sixth power of the temperature - dependent strong - coupling constant and yields an asymptotic approach to the conjectured lower bound of @xmath0 , achievable in @xmath1 sym theory . as a by - product of the calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we find a particular form of the two - point correlation function of gluonic field strengths , which is the only one consistent with the lorentzian shape of the shear - viscosity spectral function . </S>"
