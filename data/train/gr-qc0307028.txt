    "space - time asymptotics , the study of isolated gravitational systems at large distances , is one of the theoretical pillars of general relativity , whereby one can define physically important quantities which are difficult to capture in general , such as gravitational radiation , the energy flux of gravitational radiation and the active gravitational mass - energy of the system . the discovery of the bondi - sachs energy - loss equation @xcite , relating the change in total mass - energy to the energy flux of outgoing gravitational radiation , just as for electromagnetic radiation , marked a transition from an epoch where some argued that einstein s original prediction of gravitational radiation rested on mathematical artefacts , to the present epoch where there is significant investment in expectations of detecting gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources .",
    "the early work on space - time asymptotics was brilliantly reformulated by penrose @xcite , who realized how to handle infinite distances and times in a mathematically finite way .",
    "the space - time metric is mapped to a multiple of itself , the factor tending to zero in such a way that the new metric is finite and well behaved at the physical space - time infinity .",
    "the mapping is described as conformal since it preserves space - time angles and therefore causal relations , while changing distances and durations . in the conformal picture ,",
    "infinity becomes a finite boundary where one can derive exact formulas , encapsulating physical laws which were otherwise approximate or limiting .",
    "penrose s conformal theory rapidly became the standard framework for space - time asymptotics at null ( light - like ) infinity , and was quite thoroughly implemented using the spin - coefficient or null - tetrad formalism @xcite .",
    "however , it does not cover spatial infinity , described initially by the adm method @xcite and by a spatial version of penrose s method by geroch @xcite .",
    "the essential problem is to describe spatial and null infinity in a unified way .",
    "ashtekar and coworkers @xcite proposed and investigated such a definition , realizing that spatial infinity is generally a directional singularity of the conformal metric . however , there still seems to be no practical calculational formalism .",
    "some physically important issues are whether the gravitational radiation decays near spatial infinity such that the bondi - sachs energy exists and coincides with the adm energy at spatial infinity , and whether initial data on an asymptotically flat spatial hypersurface ( or past null infinity ) determines final data at future null infinity . for a more recent perspective , see e.g.  friedrich @xcite .",
    "this article presents a quite simple , natural unification of spatial and null infinity , based on a re - examination of penrose s original insights .",
    "the key new idea is that penrose s conformal factor should be a product of advanced and retarded conformal factors , which do the work of the conformal factor at future and past null infinity respectively , while cooperating at spatial infinity so that it is the vertex of a light cone , generating null infinity .",
    "these factors , squared , differentially relate physical and conformal null coordinates near the respective null infinity , up to the relevant coordinate freedom .",
    "the basic idea is most easily apprehended in examples , described in  ii .",
    " iii gives a definition of asymptotic flatness intended to encapsulate the new refinements , and shows that conformal infinity is locally a metric light cone , thereby determining standard coordinates .",
    " iv shows how to implement the theory in the spin - coefficient ( or null - tetrad ) formalism , using a simple joint transformation of the spin - metric and spin - basis ( or metric and null tetrad ) . ",
    "v identifies appropriate expansion parameters and proposes asymptotic regularity conditions at both null and spatial infinity , based on the asymptotic light cone being smoothly embedded .",
    " vi uses the hawking quasi - local energy @xcite to study the bondi - sachs energy flux ( of ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation ) and total energy at both null and spatial infinity , and the adm energy .  vii concludes .",
    "for flat space - time , the line element may be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a line element for the unit sphere . in terms of dual - null ( or characteristic )",
    "coordinates @xmath2 it becomes @xmath3 to approach infinity , the physical null coordinates @xmath4 are transformed to conformal null coordinates @xmath5 by @xmath6 this describes sterographic projection , used to map the earth on flat paper : if one projects from the north pole of a unit sphere onto the equatorial plane , with @xmath7 the angle from the vertical , then @xmath8 is the distance from the centre of a point in the plane . thus the infinite plane is mapped into the compact sphere , with the north pole representing infinity ; the sphere describes the whole plane , plus its infinity .",
    "the formula also occurs in complex analysis as a way of using the riemann sphere to represent the argand plane , plus a point at infinity .",
    "the novel point concerns the derivatives occurring in the null coordinate transformations , @xmath9 which vanish at the relevant infinity .",
    "the line element written in @xmath5 coordinates therefore contains a term @xmath10 . to obtain a metric which is regular at infinity",
    ", one can multiply by the discrepancy , the square of @xmath11 then @xmath12 a final transformation @xmath13 puts this in the form @xmath14 which is the standard line element of the einstein static universe , a metric @xmath15 . the physical space - time metric @xmath16 has been mapped to the conformal metric @xmath17 and",
    "the physical space - time manifold has been mapped to the conformal coordinate range @xmath18 .",
    "thus physical infinity has been mapped to the boundary of this region .",
    "this conformal boundary consists of two null hypersurfaces connected by three points : future null infinity @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; past null infinity @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ; future temporal infinity @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; past temporal infinity @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; and spatial infinity @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the two null hypersurfaces locally have the structure of light cones , with the three points each being vertices .",
    "this initially bizarre sixties spacewarp led penrose @xcite to the definition of conformal infinity as essentially @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the physical metric @xmath16 admitting a well behaved conformal metric @xmath17 , @xmath33 being called the conformal factor .",
    "nevertheless , there is more structure here .",
    "firstly , spatial infinity is the vertex of a conformal light cone consisting of null infinity .",
    "secondly , @xmath34 are given by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 at spatial infinity .",
    "clearly there is more information in the sub - factors @xmath38 than in the penrose factor @xmath33 alone .",
    "this structure will be used to refine penrose s definition of asymptotic flatness .",
    "henceforth @xmath39 and @xmath40 will be called the _ advanced and retarded conformal factors _ respectively .    as a second example , the schwarzschild space - time with mass @xmath41 in standard coordinates is @xmath42 this can be written in dual - null coordinates @xmath43 where @xmath44 rescales @xmath45 such that @xmath46",
    ". then @xmath47 where @xmath45 is implicitly determined as a function of @xmath48 . as before , the physical null coordinates @xmath4 may be transformed to conformal null coordinates @xmath5 by , for instance , simple inversion : @xmath49 this is valid only in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity , but is simple enough to constitute a local canonical transformation .",
    "the derivatives occurring in the null coordinate transformations are @xmath50 and one can fix @xmath51 so that @xmath52 in the physical space - time , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being future - pointing . as before , the metric in @xmath5 coordinates can be regularized by multiplying by the square of @xmath53 . then @xmath54 transforming as before by ( [ rhotau ] ) puts this in the form @xmath55 since @xmath56 as @xmath57 , the conformal metric becomes flat at infinity , with @xmath58 playing the role of conformal radius : @xmath59 thus infinity consists of a locally metric light cone with spatial infinity as the vertex .",
    "space - time has been turned inside out : spatial infinity has become a point and the physical space - time lies outside its light cone , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig ] . in more detail , the original region @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath61 has been mapped to @xmath62 , @xmath63 , or @xmath52 .",
    "the conformal boundary again locally consists of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and spatial infinity @xmath29 , where @xmath37 .",
    "the case @xmath64 was not excluded , so this also provides a conformal transformation of flat space - time such that infinity is locally a metric light cone at spatial infinity .",
    "the key points are the identification of the advanced and retarded conformal factors @xmath38 as differentially relating physical and conformal null coordinates , and their behaviour at null and spatial infinity .    .",
    "the physical space - time ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) lies outside this asymptotic light cone .",
    "radiation propagates in from past null infinity @xmath22 ( @xmath67 ) and out to future null infinity @xmath19 ( @xmath68 ) . spatial infinity @xmath29 ( @xmath37 )",
    "is the vertex . for non - zero",
    "total mass , beware the singularity beyond infinity.,width=188,height=264 ]",
    "the above insights are now converted into a definition of asymptotic flatness at both null and spatial infinity . in this section alone , @xmath16 will be used for the conformal metric and @xmath69 for the physical metric .",
    "quantities without tildes , e.g.  @xmath70 , similarly refer to the conformal metric .    in this article ,",
    "a space - time @xmath71 will be said to be asymptotically flat if the following conditions hold .",
    "( i ) there exists a space - time @xmath72 with boundary @xmath73 and functions @xmath52 on @xmath74 such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 in @xmath74 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath77 is locally a light cone with respect to @xmath16 , with vertex denoted by @xmath29 and future and past open cones denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "( iii ) @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath78 on @xmath34 , and @xmath79 on @xmath77 .",
    "( iv ) ( @xmath80 ) are @xmath81 on @xmath82 , with @xmath83 sufficing for the purposes of this article .",
    "differentiability at @xmath29 is deferred to  v.    one may call @xmath84 ( locally ) the asymptotic light cone , or more prosaically , the _ light cone at infinity",
    "the definition can be easily seen to recover the basic conditions of penrose s definition of asymptotic simplicity @xcite , namely @xmath31 and @xmath32 on @xmath34 , with the penrose factor @xmath33 as before ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "the causal restriction on ( plain or weak ) asymptotic simplicity has been replaced with the light - cone condition . note by continuity that @xmath37 at @xmath29 .",
    "the differentiability conditions at spatial infinity are notoriously awkward : if @xmath16 is @xmath85 then the total ( adm ) energy vanishes , while if @xmath16 is only @xmath86 , the total energy is generally ill - defined @xcite . readers unable to proceed otherwise can provisionally assume the ashtekar - hansen differentiability conditions at @xmath29 . essentially ,",
    "a non - zero mass forces radial derivatives of the conformal metric to be discontinuous at spatial infinity , even for the schwarzschild metric , while angular derivatives should be much smoother .",
    "a geometrical way to understand this stems from the fact that the positive - mass schwarzschild space - time can be conformally extended through @xmath34 to smoothly include a negative - mass schwarzschild space - time whose @xmath87 coincide with the physical @xmath88 @xcite . since the negative - mass schwarzschild space - time has a naked curvature singularity extending from its @xmath27 to @xmath25 , this _ singularity beyond infinity _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) piercing physical @xmath29 can be understood as forcing spatial infinity to be a directional singularity of the conformal metric .",
    "the analysis of geroch @xcite for @xmath34 , summarized together with the ashtekar - hansen analysis by wald @xcite , can be taken as a guide to the following refinements .",
    "firstly , the definition allows considerable gauge freedom in the conformal factors @xmath38 , namely @xmath89 for any @xmath81 functions @xmath90 on @xmath82 .",
    "this gauge freedom allows the conformal metric of @xmath77 to be locally fixed as that of a metric cone , as follows .",
    "the starting point is a standard expression for the physical ricci tensor @xmath91 in terms of the conformal ricci tensor @xmath92 : @xmath93 applying either the vacuum einstein equation @xmath94 or the full einstein equation with suitable fall - off of the matter fields , one sees that @xmath95 is smooth ( @xmath96 ) at @xmath34 and therefore that @xmath97 is null there .",
    "further , expanding @xmath98 and using the above definition , one finds that @xmath99 are smooth at @xmath34 and therefore that the 1-forms @xmath100 are null at @xmath34 , where the signs are chosen so that the vectors @xmath101 are future pointing , taking the choice @xmath52 in @xmath74 and the @xmath102 metric convention .",
    "the gauge freedom @xmath89 can then be used to set @xmath103 on @xmath34 , by an argument given by geroch for @xmath33 .",
    "this still leaves @xmath104 free on @xmath34 .",
    "the normalization condition , which now reads @xmath105 on @xmath77 , expresses that the hypersurfaces of constant @xmath38 intersect @xmath34 transversely ; then the gauge freedom allows one to choose them to intersect in a null direction , @xmath106 on @xmath34 .",
    "thus we have two independent null directions @xmath101 at @xmath19 and @xmath22 . the local null rescaling freedom of a null hypersurface can then be used to further adjust @xmath104 on @xmath34 so that the null directions are relatively normalized : @xmath107 on @xmath34 .",
    "all the above conditions extend to @xmath29 by continuity . using @xmath108 to denote equality on @xmath77 in a neighbourhood of @xmath29",
    ", the gauge conditions are @xmath109 together they imply that @xmath110 which shows that @xmath33 is spatial in a neighbourhood of @xmath77 .",
    "the gauge condition usually chosen for @xmath19 is that this quantity vanishes .",
    "taking the trace and rearranging , the curvature relation ( [ ricci ] ) then implies @xmath111 which again differs from the usual relation @xmath112 on @xmath19 , which would imply that @xmath19 be a metric cylinder .",
    "instead it implies that @xmath77 is a metric cone , as follows . first note that there are now preferred spatial sections of @xmath34 , given by constant @xmath104 . expanding the above relation ,",
    "@xmath113 the last term gives the part of the metric normal to the spatial sections of @xmath77 , while the first two terms are related to the expansions @xmath114 and shears @xmath115 of @xmath34 by @xmath116 on @xmath34 , where @xmath117 is the metric of the spatial sections and @xmath118 denotes projection by @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath119 one reads off @xmath120 , @xmath121 on @xmath34 .",
    "however , this describes a metric light cone , as follows .",
    "the flat metric @xmath122 in dual - null coordinates ( [ rhotau ] ) is @xmath123 where the signs of @xmath5 have been chosen so that they are future - pointing .",
    "then @xmath121 and @xmath124 on @xmath34 .",
    "since the expansions and shears , including vertex conditions , characterize the intrinsic geometry of the light cone , this identifies the conformal metric with the flat metric at @xmath77 if @xmath125 in general , @xmath5 can be taken as null coordinates with this gauge choice at @xmath77 . in summary ,",
    "the conformal metric at @xmath77 has been locally fixed as that of a metric light cone .",
    "the most developed implementation of conformal infinity involves the spin - coefficient formalism , also due to penrose and coworkers @xcite , which provides the most elegant formulation of various issues such as the sachs `` peeling '' of the gravitational field near @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "henceforth this formalism is employed , though an attempt is made to render the description accessible to the uninitiated .",
    "alternatively , the null - tetrad formalism suffices for most purposes .",
    "henceforth equation numbers in triples will indicate equations in penrose & rindler @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to modify some notation and summarize , as follows .",
    "the basic geometrical object is a 2-form @xmath126 ( 2.5.2 ) acting on complex 2-spinors ( spin - vectors ) , here called the _ spin - metric_. it can be regarded as a square root of the metric , which is expressed as a direct product @xmath127 , where the bar denotes the complex conjugate and the exact meaning of the product is given in abstract index notation ( 3.1.9 ) .",
    "an ordered pair of non - parallel spin - vectors @xmath128 is here called a _ spin - basis_. expressing vectors as spin - vector dyads , this defines a null tetrad , a vector basis ( 3.1.14 ) : @xmath129 then @xmath130 are real null vectors , whereas @xmath131 is a complex vector encoding transverse spatial vectors . in terms of the complex normalization factor ( 2.5.46 )",
    "@xmath132 one finds @xmath133 with the other eight independent ( symmetric ) contractions of the tetrad vectors vanishing . here",
    "the metric convention has switched to @xmath134 , as is regrettably standard in the spin - coefficient formalism .",
    "some conventional factors of @xmath135 are also entailed compared to the previous sections , e.g.physical null coordinates @xmath136 and conformal null coordinates @xmath137 .",
    "the inverse metric can be written @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes the symmetric tensor product .",
    "the dual basis of 1-forms ( 4.13.32 ) will be denoted by @xmath140 so that @xmath141 with the other twelve such contractions vanishing",
    ". then the metric can be written @xmath142 the tetrad covariant derivative operators ( 4.5.23 ) are denoted by @xmath143 the complex spin - coefficients @xmath144 and @xmath145 encode the ricci rotation coefficients and can be defined by ( 4.5.2627 ) as @xmath146 other notation will be taken as in penrose & rindler @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to choose null coordinates @xmath147 such that @xmath148 , which implies the dual - null gauge conditions @xcite @xmath149 it is also convenient to use penrose s complex stereographic coordinate ( 1.2.10 ) @xmath150 where @xmath151 are standard spherical polar coordinates .",
    "then @xmath152 , ( 4.14.29 ) , where ( 4.14.31 ) @xmath153 in summary , we have preferred coordinates @xmath154 such that the 1-form basis is @xmath155 the above quantities will refer to the physical metric @xmath16 and corresponding quantities for the conformal metric @xmath156 will be denoted by hats .",
    "the physical coordinates are now to be transformed to conformal coordinates @xmath157 , such that the angular coordinates @xmath158 are preserved , while the null coordinates transform to @xmath159 , with derivatives @xmath160 taking @xmath161 as an advanced ( outgoing ) null coordinate and @xmath162 as a retarded ( ingoing ) null coordinate , this means that @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the advanced and retarded conformal factors respectively , assumed positive in the space - time . for the canonical example of inversion , @xmath165 with the current convention , yielding @xmath166 .",
    "the penrose conformal factor is @xmath167 and the physical spin - metric @xmath126 is correspondingly transformed to the conformal spin - metric @xmath168 and the physical metric @xmath16 to the conformal metric @xmath169 : @xmath170 by comparing the explicit forms @xmath171 one reads off @xmath172 then the conformal 1-form basis @xmath173 is related to the physical 1-form basis by @xmath174 since @xmath175 the physical null tetrad @xmath176 and the conformal null tetrad @xmath177 are then related by @xmath178 remarkably , this is just the behaviour of the null tetrad under a transformation of spin - basis @xmath128 to @xmath179 such transformations @xmath180 , with @xmath181 generally complex , ( 4.12.2 ) , are well understood and led to the concept of weighted scalars ( 4.12.9 ) and the compacted spin - coefficient formalism @xcite . in summary , it has been shown that _",
    "the desired conformal transformation is given by a simultaneous transformation of the spin - metric and spin - basis _ , ( [ spin ] ) and ( [ frame ] ) .",
    "this can be so without the conformal factors @xmath182 exactly relating physical and conformal null coordinates as above , due to the considerable freedom in the conformal factors .",
    "the physical and conformal tetrad derivative operators are related by @xmath183 the relations between the weighted spin - coefficients are obtained straightforwardly from ( 5.6.15 ) as @xmath184 they are much simpler than the expressions ( 5.6.25 ) or ( 5.6.27 ) used previously to describe conformal transformations , due to the separation of the penrose conformal factor into advanced and retarded conformal factors . the components ( 4.11.6 ) @xmath185 of the conformally invariant weyl curvature spinor @xmath186 ( 4.6.35 ) transform even more simply as @xmath187 one can also generalize the concept of _ conformal density _ ( 5.6.32 ) to a quantity @xmath188 which transforms as @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the _ conformal weight _ , with signs chosen for convenience .",
    "then the shears @xmath191 have conformal weights @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively .",
    "also @xmath194 has conformal weight @xmath195 .",
    "generally @xmath196 is not a conformal density , but it is so in the dual - null gauge ( [ dualnull0][dualnull1 ] ) , which yields @xcite @xmath197 then @xmath198 both have conformal weight @xmath195 .",
    "it should also be remarked that this implementation can be achieved purely in the null - tetrad formalism , without ever mentioning spinors .",
    "for instance , the weighted spin - coefficients can be expressed as ( 4.5.22 ) @xmath199 the components of the weyl and ricci spinors can also be expressed in terms of the null tetrad ( 4.11.910 ) , as can the weighted derivative operators @xmath200 ( 4.12.15 ) acting on tensors , and consequently all of the compacted spin - coefficient equations ( 4.12.32 ) .",
    "the only spinorial remnant is the phase of @xmath201 , which does not enter tensorial expressions . in this purely tensorial view , _ the desired conformal transformation is given by a simultaneous transformation of the metric and null tetrad _ , ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ tetrad ] ) .",
    "it is now possible to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the space - time near both spatial and null infinity .",
    "while a detailed set of asymptotic expansions is not derived in the present article , a leading - order analysis suffices to derive some key results .    fixing the null coordinates @xmath202 on @xmath77 as in  iii so that it is locally a metric light cone , the conformal metric spheres are propagated into @xmath41 by the vectors @xmath203 , forming a preferred two - parameter family of transverse spatial surfaces , close to metric spheres , in a neighbourhood of @xmath77 .",
    "it is also convenient to fix the conformal freedom by @xmath204 so that the advanced and retarded conformal factors themselves can be used as conformal null coordinates , and as expansion parameters near @xmath205 respectively . for expansions near both spatial and null infinity , a useful combination is @xmath206 this parameter has the properties of being linear in spatial linear combinations of @xmath182 near @xmath29 , with @xmath207 at @xmath19 and @xmath208 at @xmath22 , and that the constant-@xmath209 hypersurfaces are hyperboloids wrapping the asymptotic light cone .",
    "the expansion parameter @xmath209 is also asymptotically the inverse radius @xmath210 of the transverse surfaces , as follows .",

    "asymptotic behaviour of the conformal spin - coefficients is more precisely determined by geometrical arguments , essentially concerning the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of a smoothly embedded metric light cone .",

    "this allows the limits at @xmath29 to depend on the angular direction , as is necessary e.g.  for @xmath242 in the kerr solution @xcite .    for @xmath243 , one can use the geometrical interpretation of @xmath244 as the conformal twist of the dual - null foliation , measuring the lack of commutativity of the null normal vectors @xmath130 @xcite",

    "here there is no detailed dependence on the boost direction @xmath250 ; to use geroch s terminology of universal versus physical structure @xcite , the boost dependence at @xmath29 is treated universally here , described using @xmath182 in the given gauge , while the physical dependence at @xmath29 is purely angular , encoded in the next section in functions @xmath251 which are regular at @xmath77 , defined as above ( [ regular ] ) to allow only angular dependence at @xmath29 .",
    "this seems to reflect the intuitive nature of spatial infinity as a large time - independent sphere .",
    "it is widely agreed that the most physically important discovery in space - time asymptotics is the bondi - sachs energy - loss equation @xcite , whereby the total mass - energy @xmath252 decreases at @xmath19 according to @xcite @xmath253 , where the integral is over a sphere at @xmath19 , @xmath254 denotes the area form of a unit sphere and the complex function @xmath255 corresponds to what bondi dubbed the news . in more physical terminology , @xmath256 is the conformal energy flux of the gravitational radiation , meaning that the physical energy flux is @xmath257 near @xmath19 , the above integral giving the integrated energy flux through a sphere near @xmath19 . now the news is @xmath258 @xcite , as will be verified below .",
    "the asymptotic regularity condition ( [ shear1 ] ) then implies @xmath259 , so that it is not only finite at @xmath19 , but decays near @xmath29 . transforming the bondi - sachs energy - loss equation to use the conformal null derivative ( [ deriv ] )",
    "yields @xmath260 .",
    "thus the gravitational radiation decays near spatial infinity in such a way that the total energy flux , integrated over time , is finite .",
    "moreover , the prescribed fall - off of @xmath261 is the weakest which would achieve this result .",
    "this property has been presented first because it follows so simply from the regularity conditions , thereby verifying that the asymptotic behaviour of the shears , proposed on geometrical grounds , is exactly right on physical grounds .",
    "it is also independent even of the existence of the total energy , for which one needs to expand some spin - coefficients further , specifically @xmath262 where @xmath263 are regular at @xmath77 . here",
    "the proposal is that @xmath209 is the natural expansion parameter near both spatial and null infinity , even though leading - order behaviour may depend on @xmath182 independently    to study energy near @xmath77 , a useful quantity is the hawking quasi - local mass - energy @xcite , which can be written as @xcite @xmath264 where the integral is over a transverse surface , @xmath265 denotes the area form of a transverse surface , @xmath266 is the area of a transverse surface and ( 4.14.20 ) @xmath267 is the complex curvature , satisfying a complex generalization of the gauss - bonnet theorem ( 4.14.4243 ) : @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the genus of the transverse surface , vanishing in this context . for the schwarzschild space - time considered in  ii , one finds @xmath270 ( phase irrelevant ) , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 and therefore @xmath274 .",
    "the bondi - sachs energy @xcite at @xmath19 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath275 in vacuum or with suitable fall - off of the matter terms @xmath276 and @xmath277 , ( [ k ] ) shows that it can be written as the limit of the hawking energy : @xmath278 since @xmath279 it is straightforward to see from the expansions ( [ exp0][exp1 ] ) that it is finite , given specifically by @xmath280 again one may check the schwarzschild case : @xmath281 , @xmath282 , yielding @xmath283 .",
    "note that generally _ the limit of @xmath252 at spatial infinity exists uniquely _ and is given by the same formula ( [ bs ] ) .",
    "this follows from the definition of functions regular at @xmath77 ( [ regular ] ) .",
    "any such transverse surface integral of functions regular at @xmath77 has a unique limit at spatial infinity .",
    "on the other hand , the adm energy @xcite at spatial infinity can be expressed as @xcite @xmath284 where , in the original treatment , it was unclear whether the limit depended on the boost direction @xmath250 , i.e.  on the choice of spatial hypersurface .",
    "as above , this can be written @xmath285 which is similar to the expression ( [ bs ] ) for the bondi - sachs energy , but apparently differs by the term @xmath286 in the shears .",
    "the discrepancy in the two energies is found from the asymptotic regularity conditions ( [ shear0][shear1 ] ) to be @xmath287 .",
    "this discrepancy is generally non - zero at null infinity ( @xmath288 or @xmath289 ) , so that the adm energy , if extended to null infinity by the same formula , would generally not agree with the bondi - sachs energy .",
    "however , the discrepancy vanishes at spatial infinity ( @xmath290 ) from any direction .",
    "thus _ the adm energy is the limit of the bondi - sachs energy at spatial infinity _ in this context , and also the limit of the hawking energy from any spatial or null direction : @xmath291 this provides a remarkably simple resolution of the long - standing questions over the relation of the bondi - sachs and adm energies , and the uniqueness of the latter . in the current framework , one may simply use the bondi - sachs energy on the entire asymptotic light cone @xmath77 .",
    "the resolution explicitly rests on the additional structure at spatial infinity provided by the advanced and retarded conformal factors @xmath182 .",
    "returning to the energy flux of gravitational radiation : the propagation equations for the hawking energy can be found from the compacted spin - coefficient equations ( 4.12.32 ) , using @xmath292 and @xmath293 , as @xcite @xmath294\\\\ \\thorn'e&=&\\frac{a^{1/2}}{(4\\pi)^{3/2}}\\left[\\oint{*}\\rho ' \\frac{k+\\rho\\rho'-\\tau\\bar\\tau+\\eth'\\tau-\\phi_{11}-3\\pi}{\\chi\\bar\\chi } \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } + \\left.\\oint{*}\\rho\\frac{\\sigma'\\bar\\sigma'+\\phi_{22}}{\\chi\\bar\\chi } -\\frac1a\\oint{*}\\rho'\\oint{*}\\frac{k+\\rho\\rho'}{\\chi\\bar\\chi}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rewriting these equations using the conformal spin - weighted derivatives @xmath295 , assuming either vacuum or suitable fall - off of the matter fields , and using the asymptotic regularity conditions and expansions ( [ shear0][exp1 ] ) , it can be shown that @xmath296 are @xmath297 , as expected on physical grounds .",
    "the general argument is non - trivial , subtly confirming the asymptotic regularity conditions , and uses the fact that @xmath209 is constant on the transverse surfaces to cancel terms in @xmath298 , and @xmath299 ( 4.14.69 ) .",
    "fortunately the cases of most interest are @xmath296 at @xmath300 ) respectively , where it is easier to see that most of the terms disappear , in the vacuum case leaving just @xmath301 where @xmath302 are the leading - order terms in the shears ( [ shear0][shear1 ] ) , regular at @xmath77 . in terms of the retarded and advanced news functions @xmath303",
    "this implies @xmath304 the second equation is the usual bondi - sachs energy - loss equation , showing that the outgoing gravitational radiation carries energy away from the system .",
    "the first equation similarly shows that ingoing gravitational radiation supplies energy to the system .",
    "the new energy propagation equations ( [ massgain][massloss ] ) improve on these equations by applying also in the limit at @xmath29 .",
    "thus the change in energy from @xmath29 to a section of @xmath34 is finite , as mentioned above .",
    "physically this means that _ the ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation decays near spatial infinity such that its total energy is finite_. this property , assumed in addition to the ashtekar - hansen definition of asymptotic flatness @xcite , is known to imply the coincidence of bondi - sachs and adm energies at spatial infinity @xcite , but here the property has been derived from the new definition of asymptotic flatness .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize to an asymptotic energy - momentum vector @xmath305 where the vector @xmath306 in cartesian coordinates is ( 1.4.11 ) @xmath307 then @xmath308 coincides with the bondi - sachs energy - momentum @xcite at null infinity and with the adm energy - momentum @xcite at spatial infinity .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum propagation equations are @xmath309 cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that , while the gravitational radiation at @xmath310 is respectively encoded as above in complex functions @xmath311 or @xmath312 , a more tensorial formulation would encode such shear terms in transverse traceless tensors , exactly as in the conventional treatment of linearized gravitational radiation .",
    "a new framework for space - time asymptotics has been proposed and developed , refining penrose s conformal framework by introducing advanced and retarded conformal factors .",
    "this allows a relatively simple definition of asymptotic flatness at both spatial and null infinity .",
    "it has been shown how to fix the light cone at infinity so that it is locally a metric light cone .",
    "assuming smooth embedding of the light cone , asymptotic regularity conditions have been proposed and asymptotic expansions developed .",
    "these conditions ensure that the bondi - sachs energy - momentum is finite and tends uniquely to the uniquely rendered adm energy - momentum at spatial infinity , that the ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation has the expected two modes as encoded in gravitational news functions , and that the energy - flux integrals decay at spatial infinity such that the total energy of the gravitational radiation is finite .",
    "the most basic physical properties of isolated gravitational systems have thereby been included .",
    "mathematically the new structure proposed for infinity is unprecedentedly rigid , allowing physical fields to have very simple behaviour at spatial infinity .",
    "currently there are no indications that this is too simple to be physically realistic , though open issues remain .",
    "the asymptotic symmetry group presumably simplifies accordingly .",
    "the framework , implemented in the spin - coefficient or null - tetrad formalism , is quite practical , allowing explicit calculations as for null infinity alone .",
    "while this article has presented only a leading - order analysis , asymptotic expansions can now be developed to higher orders .",
    "this would presumably allow insights into angular momentum and multipole moments of the gravitational field .",
    "a related issue is the asymptotic behaviour of the conformal curvature near spatial infinity .",
    "it may even be possible to address the long - standing question of finding a conformal form of the einstein equations which is regular at both null and spatial infinity . in any case , it is to be hoped that the refined conformal picture will stimulate a renewal of interest in space - time asymptotics .",
