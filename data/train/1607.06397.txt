    "high - altitude balloon platforms are an economical alternative to space missions for testing instruments as well as for specific classes of observations , particularly those that require a rapid response such as comets , or other transients .",
    "telescopic platforms at high altitudes have significant advantages over operations from the ground enabling observations at forbidden wavelengths . a uv telescope ( 200400 nm ) in stratosphere with aperture of just 6 inch in diameter with sufficient pointing stability / accuracy and",
    "a 1k@xmath1k ccd array could provide wide - field images with fwhm better than @xmath2 approaching the diffraction limit ( fesen & brown , 2015 ) , similar to that of space observatories but at a much lower cost .",
    "we have initiated a high - altitude balloon program at the indian institute of astrophysics to develop low - cost instruments for use in atmospheric and astronomical studies ( nayak et al .",
    "2013 , safonova et al .",
    "2016 ) . we have developed a number of payloads which operate in the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) , but we are limited to weights under 6 kg for regulatory reasons which constrains our payload size ( sreejith et al .",
    "our first experiments were of atmospheric lines ( sreejith et al .",
    "2016b ) where the pointing stability is less important , but we plan to observe astronomical sources for which a pointing mechanism is required .",
    "unlike in space missions , in stratospheric balloon pointing systems the payload is attached to the balloon by a long flight train . besides transmitting the balloon s buoyant force , the flight train is the source of disturbances that the pointing control must reject .",
    "a typical stratospheric balloon has a train of several meters in length comprised of a recovery parachute beneath with flight termination systems , which is connected to a gondola consisting of scientific equipment with communication and associated electronics .",
    "the balloon flight , planned by the tata institute of fundamental research balloon facility ( tifr - bf ) on 68th may 2016 , provided a timely opportunity to piggyback attitude instrumentation on the gondola solely to measure its natural motion during the float phase of the flight .",
    "we expect that this information would be helpful in efforts to characterize disturbances that could be expected on any balloon - borne pointing system .",
    "with a telescope placed on the high - altitude balloon payload , one of the major factor in the design of the pointing system is the transfer of oscillations from the flight train ; this constraint is more important if the required stability for observation is within a degree of accuracy . in our first experiments of atmospheric lines",
    "( sreejith et al . 2016 ) the pointing accuracy was not of a great concern , but we plan to observe astronomical sources for which pointing and stabilization of the order of arcseconds are required",
    ". the disturbances can excite the balloon ",
    "payload train dynamics , which at the float altitude may disrupt pointing .",
    "there are two categories of disturbances : transverse and azimuth .",
    "transverse disturbances include swinging and bouncing oscillations that mostly affect gondola ( or telescope ) motion about the two horizontal axes ( elevation and tilt ) .",
    "azimuth disturbances are rotation disturbances about the vertical that similarly affect the telescope azimuth positioning .",
    "payload teams devise methods for mitigating the effects of these disturbances .",
    "the primary strategy is to place the balloon in as quiet an environment as possible during the observation , resulting in the so - called ` observational windows '  a period when the winds in stratosphere are low and steady ( see e.g. manchanda et al .",
    "in addition , the balloon team at tifr - bf uses the bifilar load line suspension to mitigate the disturbances ( robbins & martone , 1991 ) .",
    "the second strategy is in the careful design of the pointing system .",
    "the most common pointing configuration is the azimuth / elevation configuration , where the telescope is tilted about a horizontal elevation axis , fixed in the payload .",
    "we have designed and developed a low - cost lightweight , closed - loop pointing system build completely from off - the - shelf components ( nirmal et al .",
    "the system performance was checked on the ground and in tethered flights with satisfactory results .",
    "the system can point to an accuracy of @xmath3 , and track objects from the ground with an accuracy of @xmath4 .",
    "it is not certain whether the balloon itself is going to rotate during a flight ; however , balloon rotation even during float has been noted in the past ( e.g. gruner et al . 2005 ) .",
    "with no requirement to point the gondola on this flight , an inertial measurement unit ( imu ) with internal li - polymer battery ( tested previously in the lab to work for up to 12 hrs ) and a 4 gb sd card for data logging ( fig .",
    "[ figure : imu_photo ] and table  [ table : imu ] ) , was placed into the main payload ( gondola ) ( fig .",
