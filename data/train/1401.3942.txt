    "increasing the density of particles in granular materials causes them to undergo a transition from an unjammed state , in which the particles can move relatively freely , to a jammed state , in which almost none of the particles can move  @xcite .",
    "systems of interest in nature and in industrial applications typically have complicated geometries which strongly affect jamming in them  @xcite , and it is thus important to understand how does confinement influence the jamming of granular matter . here",
    "we investigate the effects of confinement on the jamming transition , and in particular test how does the shape of containers , and not only their volume , determine how they jam .",
    "most theoretical work so far was done on square and cubic systems , or even in the infinite system size limit @xcite .    there are numerous laboratory experiments that deal with non - square two - dimensional systems @xcite . for example , daniels and behringer conducted an experiment on polypropylene spheres in an annulus @xcite , which is large enough to be considered a rectangle with infinite length and finite width . a different experiment by bi et al .",
    "@xcite consists of shearing a square system such that it becomes a rectangle with the same area and particle density as the original square .",
    "other experiments , such as @xcite , considered colloids confined between quasiparallel plates .    in this paper",
    "we study the effects of confinement on jamming by studying these phenomena in kinetically - constrained models in d - dimensional hyper - rhomboids .",
    "the essence of jamming is captured by the various kinetically - constrained models @xcite .",
    "such simple models , and other related models @xcite , have exact solutions , which help us to obtain deep insights on the physical processes responsible for the corresponding phenomena in real systems .",
    "we consider the kob - andersen ( ka ) @xcite and fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) @xcite models on hyper - cubic lattices of arbitrary dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the system is confined to a hyper - rhombus of size @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 for all @xmath3 . in the ka model",
    "each site may be occupied by at most one particle , and a particle can move to a neighboring vacant site if it has at least @xmath4 neighboring vacancies before and after the move . in the fa model",
    "a site can change its state from occupied to vacant or vice versa if it has at least @xmath4 neighboring vacancies .",
    "if @xmath5 , then even a single vacancy can facilitate the movement of the entire system , and thus all the particles can move eventually regardless of the system s shape or size .",
    "if @xmath4 is less than or equal to the system s dimension , @xmath0 , there are no frozen particles in an infinite system . however ,",
    "if at least @xmath6 of the system s sides are of finite size , there is a finite probability that there will be a frozen structure spanning the system from one edge to the other . if @xmath4 is larger than the system s dimension , consider a completely occupied @xmath0-dimensional small hypercube inside the system .",
    "each particle in this hypercube has at most @xmath0 neighboring vacancies , and so will never move . hence , there is always a finite fraction of frozen particles even for an infinite system .",
    "moreover , these frozen particles are not necessarily connected to the system s edges and can be  free - floating \" in the middle , and we do not refer to this situation as jammed . in general , there is a finite probability for having frozen particles as long as at least @xmath6 of the rhomboid s sides are finite .    for infinite systems ,",
    "the critical density is the density at which the fraction of frozen particles is singular @xcite .",
    "although no real phase transition occurs in finite systems , there is a crossover transition between an almost unfrozen regime , in which almost all of the particles on average are unfrozen , to a frozen regime , in which almost all the particles are frozen .",
    "we use the average fraction of frozen particles , @xmath7 , as the order parameter , and define the critical density as the density at which on average half of the particles are frozen , @xmath8 . with hard - wall boundary conditions , our order parameter can be thought of as a point - to - set correlation function @xcite , because it measures the probability that a particle is frozen given that the outside edges of the system are blocked .",

    "although for @xmath24 the critical vacancy density in the thermodynamic limit @xmath25 is @xmath26 , it is still important to know the effects that the size and shape of the system have on @xmath27 , since real and simulated systems are of finite size and can be of different shapes .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate systems which are infinite or very large in some directions and finite or small in other directions , such as very long tunnels that have a finite width .",
    "in @xcite we investigated two - dimensional rectangular systems in the @xmath17 fa and ka models , and found that the critical vacancy density in infinitely long tunnels with a finite width @xmath28 scales as @xmath29 , which is qualitatively different from @xmath30 for square systems in eq .",
    "( [ lam22 ] ) . here , we expand our previous work by considering @xmath0-dimensional hyper - rhomboids with any @xmath31 .      in this work",
    "we distinguish between weak confinement and strong confinement , depending on the number of effective dimensions of the hyper - rhomboid , @xmath32 . a tunnel , for example , has one effective dimension , @xmath33 , while a 3d system confined between closely separated parallel walls has @xmath34 .",

    "when the system is of finite size , its critical density is mainly governed by the size of the largest @xmath32 dimensions if @xmath36 , or by the size of the smallest @xmath38 dimensions if @xmath37 .",
    "hence , we define a weakly confined system as a system with @xmath36 ( since the confinement in the @xmath38 small dimensions has only a weak effect ) , and a strongly confined system as a system with @xmath37 .    a weakly confined system is characterized by long range correlations . by making a small , local change in the configuration ,",
    "the entire system can change from being unjammed to jammed and vice versa . in a strongly confined system ,",
    "the correlations are short - ranged .",
    "there are clusters of frozen and unfrozen particles , such that a small local change in the configuration may change the state of the local cluster , but not of the entire system .",
    "we also find analytical expressions for the critical density for different hyper - rhomboids . by changing the system s shape , but not its total volume or particle density",
    ", the critical density also changes , such that it may be above the particle density for some shape but below it for a different shape .",

    "the main idea is to start from a very small unblocked region and try to expand it isotropically in all directions by checking if the sites adjacent to the unblocked region satisfy some condition ( which depends on @xmath0 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , the most probable shape that a droplet can unblock is a hyper - cube .",
    "however , other shapes , as long as they are not too deformed , can also be unblocked by a single droplet , because the system s edges do not impede the expansion of the droplet .",
    "we show below ( for @xmath19 ) and in appendix [ critd4 ] ( for @xmath45 ) that for weakly confined systems ( @xmath36 ) , if there is a critical droplet it will unblock the entire system with high probability .",
    "the implication of this is that if a particle is frozen , there is no critical droplet , and thus the other particles in the system are highly likely to be frozen as well .",
