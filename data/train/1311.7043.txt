    "a possible time dependence of the radioactive nuclei decay constant has been searched for since the beginning of the science of radioactivity .",
    "for instance , in the ph.d . of m. curie",
    "@xcite one can already find the negative results of the search for a difference in the radioactivity of uranium between midday and midnight .",
    "recently , the interest in the subject has been renewed @xcite since various experiments have reported evidence of such an effect with period of one year ( most cases ) but also of about one month or one day . in particular , in @xcite the constancy of the activity of a @xmath3ra source has been measured with an ionization chamber .",
    "an annual modulation of amplitude 0.15@xmath4 , having the maximum in february and the minimum in august , has been observed .",
    "the activity of a @xmath5eu source has also been measured by means of a ge(li ) detector and an even larger annual modulation ( 0.5@xmath4 ) has been detected .",
    "alburger and collaborators @xcite measured the half - life of @xmath6si , which is interesting for many applications in earth science .",
    "data , collected in four years , show an evident annual modulation , with an amplitude of about 0.1@xmath4 .",
    "in @xcite the existence of new and unknown particle interaction has been advocated to explain the yearly variation in the activity of radioactive sources @xcite .",
    "the authors correlate these variations to the sun - earth distance . on the other hand , the possibility for",
    "anti - neutrinos affecting the @xmath7 decay has been excluded in a recent reactor experiment @xcite .    the paper by jenkins and collaborators @xcite triggered a renewed interest in the subject .",
    "old and recent data have been analyzed , or reanalyzed , to search for periodic and sporadic variations with time .",
    "some of the measurements and analyses confirm the existence of oscillations @xcite whereas others contradict this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite presents the time dependence of the counting rate for @xmath8co , @xmath9sr and @xmath9y sources , measured with geiger mller detectors and for a @xmath10pu source , measured with silicon detectors .",
    "while beta sources show an annual ( and monthly ) variation with amplitude of about 0.3@xmath4 , the count rate from the pu source is fairly constant .",
    "the most updated list of experimental results on different nuclei showing time - dependent decay rate is given in @xcite .",
    "since we believed that more dedicated experiments were needed to carefully investigate the time dependence of the decay constant , two years ago we performed an experiment underground at the gran sasso laboratory ( lngs ) with a @xmath11cs source and a heavily shielded germanium detector @xcite .",
    "time dependence in the order of 0.2@xmath4 were previously reported for @xmath11cs @xcite .",
    "results of our experiment have already been published . very briefly , any oscillation with period between 6 hours and 1 year and with amplitude larger than 9.6@xmath1210@xmath13 has been excluded at 95@xmath4 confidence level ( c.l . ) . in particular , for an oscillation period of 1 year a limit of 8.5@xmath1210@xmath13 at 95@xmath4 c.l . on the maximum allowed amplitude has been set independently of the phase .    in the next section",
    "we describe our methodological approach , before giving in section 3 and 4 the results of the two new experiments we performed to study the electron - capture partial decay constant of @xmath0k and the decay chain of @xmath1th ( alpha and beta decay ) , the former above ground and the latter underground at lngs . before giving conclusions",
    ", we describe in section 5 the decay rate of the two radioactive sources in correspondence with the strong x - class solar flares which took place in may 2013 .",
    "finally , we show in the appendix that the size of a possible modulation induced by the coupling with a scalar field sourced by the sun ( one of the few mechanisms introduced to explain the effect ) could be only at the level of 10@xmath14 , at most .",
    "the general aim of our dedicated experiments is to reach a sensitivity better than 1 part over 10000 ( 1@xmath15 level ) on a possible annual modulation . for this a rate of the order of @xmath16 events / day",
    "is needed .",
    "note that this is true as far as the statistical uncertainty only is concerned , without including possible systematical effects that can only worsen the sensitivity .",
    "gamma spectroscopy offers a powerful and simple method to investigate the stability of nuclear decay rates . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is a wide choice of radioactive isotopes , half lives , gamma ray energies , source dimensions and physical forms ( point - like or extended ) .",
    "moreover , with a gamma ray detector of good energy resolution , like germanium or sodium iodide crystals , it is possible to identify the emitters and in most cases also the origin of the background .",
    "the typical experimental configuration that we adopted is the following : a radioactive source that illuminates a detector , an electronic chain that processes the signal , a multichannel analyzer that produces an energy spectrum , saved by an acquisition system at fixed intervals of time .",
    "the source / detector assembly is surrounded by a heavy lead shielding in order to suppress the external gamma background .",
    "cosmic rays are an unavoidable background source that can not be suppressed with any realistic amount of lead or other shielding material .",
    "in addition , their flux is not constant in time , giving a serious limit to the investigation of subtle variations in nuclear decay rates as the ones we are interested in .",
    "the solution we choose to avoid such a background in the @xmath1th experiment is to install the experiment deep underground in the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "the mountain shield suppresses the muon and neutron flux by six and three orders of magnitude , respectively , as compared to the above ground .    in the measurements described in the following sections we consider the entire energy spectrum and not only the full energy peaks",
    "this because we want to avoid any inaccuracy coming from the fitting procedure and we also want to increase the total rate in order to improve the statistics .",
    "this procedure requires the definition of lower and upper boundaries .",
    "since the content of the energy spectrum above @xmath173 mev is negligible , the only delicate point is the stability of the lower threshold that should be low enough to collect the entire spectrum and high enough to be well above the electronic noise . note that if the low energy threshold is sufficiently low and placed inside a flat region of the spectrum then it is also less sensitive to the variation of the global gain of the electronic chain .",
    "spectra are collected at fixed intervals ( 1 hour or 1 solar day ) , with the timing for data acquisition provided by the internal quartz oscillator of the acquisition card .",
    "its precision and stability ( better than 10 ppm / year ) are enough for our purposes .",
    "sources can have different configurations , point - like or extended . in the case of point - like sources",
    "it is essential to keep its position fixed as well as the distance between the source itself and the detector . as a matter of fact",
    ", a variation of only 1 micron in the distance gives rise in one of our typical set - ups to a change in the detection efficiency of about 5@xmath1210@xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the mechanical stability of the source support , it is also necessary to avoid large temperature and atmospheric pressure fluctuations , that can modify the source - detector distance .",
    "the typical length variation with temperature in metals is of the order of 20 ppm per degree . as a consequence",
    ", a moderate thermal stabilization is needed to avoid spurious effects on the rate .",
    "the location of our experimental setups in underground laboratory or in the basement of above ground buildings represents a well acceptable solution . in any case ,",
    "temperature and pressure are monitored . on the other hand , the selection of an extended source ,",
    "if possible , makes all the above discussed requests much less severe .",
    "once collected , spectrum data are averaged over a period of 1 day ( or larger if necessary ) and then fitted with the expected curve , normally an exponential , unless the source has not yet reached the secular equilibrium .",
    "the presence of effects due to unknown systematics and/or non standard behaviors can be indicated by bad chi squared values of the fit .",
    "finally , time modulations of the rate are searched for with the fourier transform method applied to the residuals or with the minimization of the chi squared fit of the residuals with a cosine function of time . as a matter of fact",
    ", fourier transform can be rigorously applied only when searching for periods significantly smaller than the counting time . in particular , we have chosen a limit equal to one third of the run time .",
    "the detector , a 3``x3 '' nai crystal , is installed above ground , in the basement of one of the lngs buildings .",
    "the source is made by about 16 kg of potassium bicarbonate powder ( khco@xmath18 , corresponding to 6.24 kg of natural potassium ) contained inside a stainless steel box placed around the detector .",
    "the whole set - up is shielded by at least 10 cm of lead and the electronic signals are processed by an ortec digibase ( shaping time : 0.75 @xmath19s ) .",
    "k set - up and then underground in the gran sasso laboratory , averaged over 5 days .",
    "the 1024 adc channels cover the energy range between 15 kev and 3500 kev . ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    -5 mm    the intrinsic background , measured in similar conditions , but without the powder inside the box , gives a rate of 2.4 s@xmath20 in the energy window 15 - 3500 kev .",
    "the contribution to the background due to cosmic rays has been measured by comparing the spectra obtained with a lead shielded 3``x3 '' nai crystal placed first close to the @xmath0k set - up and then underground in the gran sasso laboratory ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it amounts to 0.997(5 ) s@xmath20 , to be compared with 788 s@xmath20 due to the potassium source.the underground spectrum is below the above ground one at any energy , in particular the line at 511 kev due to positron annihilation is absent underground .",
    "we observe that electrons from beta decay give rise to bremsstrahlung photons which can be detected by the sodium iodide crystal in addition to the ones from electron capture decay .",
    "we have evaluated by monte carlo simulation that the bremsstrahlung photons , because of the absorption in the 1.5 mm thick stainless steel box containing the salt and in the 0.5 mm thick aluminum body around the crystal , give a contribution of , at most , 5@xmath4 to the rate .",
    "this contribution is confined to the gamma energy region below 300 kev .",
    "spectra are stored once per hour with a relative dead time of 3.54@xmath1210 @xmath21 , which has a fluctuation of 1.5@xmath1210 @xmath13 , at most . during the 700 days of data taking we measured a peak position shift ( proportional to the channel number ) of at most 14 channels for the @xmath0k peak at 1461 kev energy",
    "this shift is due both to the high voltage drift and to the temperature variation ( at most 6 degrees , slowly changing with time ) .",
    "k source averaged over 1 day .",
    "day zero is november 30th , 2011 .",
    "the vertical line marks the end of the stabilization time for the potassium bicarbonate powder .",
    "the @xmath22 minimization gives the cosine curve .",
    "the two horizontal lines are drawn at @xmath235@xmath1210@xmath24 from the average . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    -6 mm    the rate is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we see that there is an increase up to 0.3 s@xmath20 , corresponding to less than 4 @xmath1210@xmath24 , during the first 4 months of the experiment , followed by a decrease of 0.2 s@xmath20 in the next 2 months .",
    "afterwards the rate stays constant in time for more than 500 days .",
    "the behavior in the first 200 days of data taking is due , in our opinion , to two processes in competition : the settlement of the powder inside the steel box , that increase the detection efficiency , and the capture of water by the potassium salt , slightly hygroscopic , that decreases the efficiency due to the increase of the average density of the extended source and of its self absorption ( the box containing the powder is closed but not hermetically sealed ) . as a matter of fact , when we opened the box containing the salt at the end of the experiment we saw that the salt , originally a crystalline powder , had become a unique solid body with a volume reduction of about 1.5@xmath4 .",
    "this volume reduction , together with the water absorption , gave rise to the detection efficiency change responsible for the non constant rate during the first 200 days of the experiment .",
    "in the following analysis we refer only to the data taken starting from day 200 .",
    "we do not consider to do any dead time correction to the data but we do apply a correction to the content of the first bin due to the peak position shift ( 0.005 @xmath4 at most ) . the rate as function of time ,",
    "when fitted with a constant and using as uncertainty the linear sum of the poisson fluctuation ( 1.2@xmath1210@xmath24 relative uncertainty ) plus the fluctuation of the live time ( 7@xmath1210@xmath25 relative uncertainty ) gives a chi squared per degree of freedom , @xmath26 , of 1.08 .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of the fourier transform of the residuals , for periods from 3 to 150 days , and of the chi - squared analysis for longer periods : there is a clear modulation for a period of 1 year with an amplitude of 4.5@xmath230.8@xmath1210@xmath13 and maximum at august 11th ( @xmath23 13 days ) .",
    "it corresponds to a @xmath23 3.5@xmath4 modulation of the cosmic ray background we measured and it is well compatible both in size and in phase with the known annual modulation of the cosmic ray flux at the earth surface , which we must see because of the sensitivity of our experiment .",
    "the inclusion of this oscillating component into the fit lowers the @xmath26 to 1.03 . on the other hand ,",
    "any oscillation with period different from 1 year and with amplitude larger than 2.6@xmath1210@xmath13 is excluded at 99.7@xmath4 c.l . independently of the phase .",
    "-6 mm    if , for sake of completeness , we consider the entire data taking period , including also the first 200 days , we can in any case exclude a maximum variation of the rate larger than @xmath23 3 @xmath12 10@xmath24 without any evident periodicity , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the activity of a thorium source ( alpha and beta decay ) is measured with a 3``x3 '' nai crystal installed deep underground in the stella facility ( subterranean low level assay ) of lngs . as a consequence , the background due to cosmic rays and neutrons is strongly suppressed .",
    "the source is obtained from an optical lens , made by special glass heavily doped with thorium oxide .",
    "note that this technique , used for improving the optical properties of glass , was quite common until the seventies .",

    "spectra ( figure 4 ) are stored once per day with a dead time of about 1.3 @xmath4 . during the 480 days of data taking we measured a peak position shift ( proportional to the channel number ) which is at most of 15 channels for the @xmath29tl peak at 2615 kev energy .",
    "the rate is shown in figure 5 .",
    "we see that the chain is not in equilibrium since there is a rate increase of @xmath30 over a time period of 1 year .",
    "the time dependence of the rate is well described by the equations ruling the recovery of secular equilibrium @xcite , as shown by the continuous line in figure 5 .",
    "this is consistent with the glass of the lens being produced 38 years ago , when the removal of @xmath27ra ( isotope of the thorium chain with half - life of 5.75 years ) took place .",

    "the chain is not affecting our time modulation search .",

    "however , the same period is present , with an amplitude of 2@xmath1210@xmath31 , in the daily averaged dead time per event , obtained from the multichannel analyzer , which , on the contrary , should stay constant .",
    "the modulation of the rate and of the daily averaged dead time per event have the same period and opposite phase .",
    "we attribute this effect , which is the intrinsic limit of the measurement , to the instabilities of the rc circuit providing the shaping time of the amplifier . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a not well fixed shaping time gives rise to a variable duration of the veto signal and , as a consequence , to a variable number of rejected pile - up events .",
    "for comparison , the fluctuations of the dead time per event measured in the potassium experiment , where a different electronic chain is used , are smaller by a factor 10 and do not show any periodicity .",
    "-6 mm    therefore , we consider the 300 day modulation to be a systematic effect and , in spite of the excellent statistical uncertainty of 5@xmath1210@xmath25 , we can only exclude any oscillation with period smaller than 1 year and amplitude larger than 4@xmath1210@xmath13 , being this the size of our largest systematic uncertainty .",

    "solar flares are classified according to the power of the x - ray flux peak near the earth as measured by the goes-15 geostationary satellite : x identifies the class of the most powerful ones , with a power at the peak larger than 10@xmath24 w / m@xmath32 ( within the x - class there is then a linear scale ) .    in @xcite",
    "a significant dip ( up to 4@xmath1210@xmath21 , @xmath177 @xmath15 effect ) in the count rate , averaged on a time interval of 4 hours , has been observed in the activity of a @xmath171 @xmath19ci source of @xmath33mn ( electron - capture ) in coincidence with the x - class solar flares from december 2nd 2006 to january 1st 2007 . on the other hand , a different experiment with a @xmath1710@xmath21 sensitivity , carried out by parkhomov @xcite , did not observe any deviation in the activity of @xmath8co , @xmath9sr - y and @xmath10pu sources in coincidence with the same flares .",

    "such a limit is obtained by taking twice the statistical uncertainty .",
    "recently , various experiments have reported evidence of a time dependence of the radioactive nuclei decay constant with period , in most cases , of one year and amplitude at the per mil level . in particular , the annual modulation has been correlated to the change of the sun - earth distance between aphelion and perihelion . in the gran sasso laboratory we performed two experiments to search for modulations in the electron - capture decay of @xmath0k and in the decay chain of @xmath1th ( alpha and beta decay ) .    in the decay rate of @xmath0k",

    "a variation of the higgs vev , would manifest itself in an annual variation of the electron to proton mass ratio @xmath19 , and consequently of spectral lines , of the same amount .",

    "the best bound comes from comparing cesium atomic clocks with superconducting microwave cavities oscillator .",
    "the frequency of the cavity - controlled oscillators was compared during 10 days to that of cesium .",
    "the relative drift rate was @xmath69 @xcite , which , extrapolated to an annual timescale , gives @xmath70 and then , using [ sw ] ,      our analysis clearly excludes a scalar field from the sun as a possible origin of a modulation of the nuclear decay rate with a per mil amplitude and , as a consequence , a different mechanism would have to be found to explain the reported evidence , if it were confirmed .",
