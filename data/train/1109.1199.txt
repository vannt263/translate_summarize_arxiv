    "simulating complex physical phenomena using systems that offer precise control of physical interactions , such as ultracold atoms @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite and trapped ions @xcite has attracted much attention in the last decade .",
    "it has been recently shown that cavity qed systems can be utilized for the same purpose , in particular to simulate certain gauge potentials , the anomalous hall effect , and the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the potential use of cavity qed systems to simulate such physical models relies on the successful simulation of jahn - teller ( jt ) interactions @xcite which require atom - photon ultrastrong coupling conditions @xcite .",
    "jt models describe the interaction of localized electronic states with vibrational ( phonon ) modes in crystals or in molecules @xcite .",
    "cavity qed systems have been already proposed to simulate single mode jt models @xcite . on the other hand , many practical systems need a description in terms of multi - mode jt interactions @xcite .",
    "we address the question of how to generalize the restrictive single mode simulation of jt systems to two - mode jt interactions within the circuit qed context .",
    "circuit qed @xcite offers the possibility to operate in the ultrastrong coupling regime @xcite for efficient jt and related spin - boson or dicke model simulations .",
    "photonic waveguide arrays are alternatively proposed @xcite for reaching the deep ultrastrong coupling regime ( dsc ) @xcite of jt type light - matter interaction .    our idea is to consider a system consisting of a two - level atom simultaneously interacting with two cavities coupled to each other , rather than with a degenerate two - mode cavity , which was considered for the cylindrically symmetric @xmath0 jt model in cavity qed @xcite . in terms of the normal modes of the coupled cavities , our system allows simulating a two - frequency ( two non - degenerate vibrational normal modes ) @xmath1 jt model @xcite .",
    "the normal modes of the two coupled cavities consist of a high frequency component and a low frequency component .",
    "the coupling strength between the cavities can be utilized to alter the frequency ratio of the modes to simulate different frequency ratios encountered in different jt impurities in solids @xcite .",
    "in addition to more realistic simulations of jt systems , establishing a link between multi - mode jt models and coupled circuit qed systems could enable exploring many body physics such as quantum chaos @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite , and quantum entanglement in jt systems @xcite by using coupled cavity arrays .    we consider a coupled circuit qed @xcite system in the ultrastrong coupling regime as a feasible platform on which to realize our idea .",
    "the system consists of two coupled lumped - element lc resonators interacting with a two - level artificial atom , a superconducting flux qubit . in the ultrastrong coupling regime the rotating - wave approximation is not valid , so that the qubit - resonator coupling is of jt type rather than jaynes - cummings type @xcite , allowing strongly coupled multi - frequency jt systems to be simulated . the switchable ultrastrong coupling architecture can also be applied if a tunable coupling strength between the resonators and the flux qubit is desired @xcite .",
    "typical treatments of strongly coupled multi - mode jt systems in chemistry or in condensed matter physics utilize a cluster model @xcite , or use an effective single mode model where most of the jt interaction energy is concentrated predominantly upon a single effective vibrational frequency with a negligible spread ( narrow range of frequencies ) @xcite .",
    "these methods are especially used for interpreting effects associated with low energy states , such as those seen in low temperature optical absorption @xcite .",
    "when the frequency difference between the two modes is large , the situation is analogous to the case of optical and acoustic phonons in solids for which perturbative corrections become significant .",
    "we show that the frequency separation of the modes over which the jt interaction is distributed can be tuned with the coupling strength between the resonators .",
