    "in recent years bell inequalities @xcite were tested in systems of correlated neutral @xmath1 @xcite or @xmath2 mesons @xcite",
    ". however , the quantum mechanical analysis of such systems encounters an important difficulty , namely , the irreversibility of time - evolution of unstable particles . only the complete system consisting of the decaying particle as well as the decay products undergoes unitary evolution , which is actually described by quantum field theory .",
    "but in einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlation experiments @xcite , it is more useful to consider the decaying particles only , neglecting the evolution of decay products . in the usual approach",
    "one introduces a non - hermitian hamiltonian , as it was done in the classical works of weisskopf and wigner @xcite .",
    "however , the non - hermitian hamiltonian does not provid an unambiguous way of calculating the probability of finding the system consisting of a few such particles in a given state after the measurement ( such an approach causes also other ambiguities , see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion ) . indeed , using this approach , we must reinterpret quantum mechanical results with the help of probability theory , especially if we would like to analyze correlation experiments with unstable particles , namely , neutral @xmath1 or @xmath2 mesons @xcite . from the quantum mechanical point of view",
    ", this means that unit trace and positivity of the density matrix for the system under consideration must be preserved @xcite .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to resolve the above - mentioned problems using the open quantum systems theory @xcite .",
    "the idea that unstable particles can be treated as open quantum systems was proposed first by r.  alicki @xcite and was developed by various authors in different contexts ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , this approach was successfully applied to the systems of particles with flavour oscillations ( like in the case of neutral kaons or @xmath2 mesons ) @xcite , and it has been used successfully in the description of epr correlations and evolution of entanglement in @xmath3 system @xcite .    in this theory",
    "the evolution of a quantum system is described by the master equation @xcite , which can be treated as the replacement for either von neumann or heisenberg equations , for the picture of quantum mechanics in use . here ,",
    "we follow the approach presented in @xcite , where systems with an arbitrary number of particles were described with the use of the second quantization formalism , which seems to be the most natural language for a system with varying number of particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : states ] we introduce the notation and conventions used through the paper . in sect .",
    "[ sec : master ] we introduce the master equation for a system of neutral kaons with violated @xmath0 symmetry and we find the evolution of the observables in the heisenberg picture , and , in sect .

    "however , the expectation values of @xmath138 in the states @xmath131 and @xmath132 are well established and can be calculated as    @xmath142    because @xmath143 in conclusion , we get that the mean number of @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the states @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , evolves in time according to the geiger - nutall law    @xmath144    the states @xmath131 and @xmath132 are not orthogonal , thus we expect nonzero expectation values of @xmath129 and @xmath141 in the states @xmath132 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "indeed ,    @xmath145 \\ket{n_l}\\ ] ]    and @xmath146       \\ket{n_s}\\,,\\ ] ]    thus ,    @xmath147    so , finally we see that we can detect a fraction of order @xmath148 of the other flavor in multiparticle short- or long - lived neutral kaon states .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to formulate the consistent and probability - preserving description of the @xmath0-symmetry - violating evolution of a system containing any number of decaying particles .",
    "this has been done within the framework of quantum mechanics of open systems based on the approach developed in @xcite . to achieve this aim",
    "we have considered master equations built up from creation and annihilation operators which generate dynamical semigroups that can describe the exponential decay and flavour oscillations for a system of many particles .",
    "it should be noted that this dynamical semigroup was used for the description of the entire system of unstable particles , and not only for decoherence effects , as it was done in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we have used the fact that the decay of the particle can be regarded as a markov process ( the probability of decay of a particle is constant , so it does not depend on its history ) and we have solved explicitly the kossakowski - lindblad master equation for a system of particles with violated @xmath0 symmetry . to avoid working with infinite numbers of density matrix elements we performed calculations in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics .",
    "this allowed us to deal with a low - dimensional system of linear differential equations for evolution of _ any _ observable bilinear in creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the choice of a concrete observable is then reduced to the proper choice of initial conditions for the system of differential equations . to show explicitly the effectiveness of the introduced approach we have calculated the evolution of the observables which are most interesting from the physical point of view .",
    "we have also found the evolution of mean values of these observables as well as their lowest order difference with the @xmath0-preserved values .",
    "it seems to us that the presented analysis of time evolution of neutral kaons could be applied to the description of epr states .",
    "of course one must construct such a state by labeling annihilation and creation operators either by a discrete index , as it is done in quantum optics , or by a continuous parameter , as it is done in quantum field theory ( beware that in the latter case annihilation and creation operators are actually operator valued distributions ) .",
    "moreover , we think that our approach would be interesting and helpful also in analysis of mechanical systems and electric circuits .",
    "this follows from the fact that there is a  strong analogy with nonreversible classical mechanics and quantum systems with @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that all the presented results are also valid for neutral @xmath149 mesons after appropriate change of notation and values of physical quantities .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath149 mesons evolve according to the same scheme as kaons .",
