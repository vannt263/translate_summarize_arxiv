    "[ fig3]-(b ) ) which are indistinguishable . since the bps d - vortices are thin , the moduli geometry is a cone with a sharp singular apex .",
    "the motion at the tip of the cone is then unpredictable , and what we can apply is only the symmetry argument ; the vortex motion is either overcoming the tip or bouncing back there .",
    "the bouncing - back motion of d - vortices in the moduli space corresponds to the @xmath169 or @xmath175 scattering of two identical cosmic d - strings crossing in the physical space .",

    "this affects the reconnection probability of cosmic superstrings and one has @xmath178 .",
    "this classical result with the help of a quantum concept of identical particles predicts only the possible scattering patterns .",
    "the probability @xmath179 is determined by taking into account the quantum correction as shown in fig .",
    "in this work , we obtained the bps solution to the multi d - vortices produced in the coincidence limit of d2@xmath02 .",
    "the model is described by a dbi - type action with a complex tachyon field . with a gaussian type - potential",
    ", we showed that the bps limit is achieved by an infinitely thin tachyon profile .",
    "the obtained bps configuration correctly reproduces the bps sum rule and descent relation which result in the identification of bps d - vortices as bps d - branes of codimension two .    for multi bps d - vortices",
    ", it is expected that the thin vortices are point - like particles moving freely when they are separated .",
    "assuming that the time - dependence of the system is encoded only in the vortex positions in dynamics , we integrated the lagrangian of the dbi action to obtain a simple lagrangian @xmath180 which describes @xmath1 free relativistic point particles with the mass given by the d0-brane tension .    while the scattering of nielsen - olesen vortices exhibits only the 90@xmath2 scattering , the scattering of bps d - vortices exhibits also the @xmath169/180@xmath2 scattering . when this scattering picture is applied to the interaction of cosmic superstrings",
    ", it implies that two identical bps d - strings can pass through each other ( @xmath169/180@xmath2 scattering ) as well as can reconnect ( 90@xmath2 scattering ) .",
    "this is one of the key differences of cosmic superstrings from usual cosmic strings .",
