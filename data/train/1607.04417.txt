    "a plausible expectation is that quantum effects are purely suppressed upon increasing temperature due to the additional thermal fluctuations .",

    "+ besides static correlations at zero frequency , the finite frequency response is an interesting quantity , since it results from excitations in the system . in gapped quantum magnets , the energetically lowest excitations are coherent at zero temperature and do not decay .",

    "indeed many studies on the spin dynamics in heisenberg antiferromagnets suggested a universal lorentzian line - shape for gapped as well as gapless excitations @xcite at low temperature .",
    "+ however , recent investigations of one dimensional @xcite and three dimensional @xcite materials of coupled spin dimers using inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) show , that the line - shape in the frequency domain develops an asymmetric tail .",

    "+ using conventional ins it has been shown that copper nitrate ( cu(no@xmath1)@xmath2 d@xmath3o ) , a model material for a one dimensional alternating heisenberg chain ( ahc ) , displays a temperature dependent asymmetric line - shape in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "the material was recently investigated in the time domain using the high resolution neutron resonance spin - echo triple - axis ( nrse - tas ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of nrse - tas @xcite is , that it gives access to slow processes corresponding to energies in the @xmath4ev range , which are not accessible by conventional ins .",
    "contrary to conventional , where inaccuracies in background correction directly affect the linewidth and asymmetry , the linewidth or asymmetry measured with nrse - tas is insensitive to the background intensity , since the broad distribution in energy of the background is depolarized and does not contribute .",
    "in addition , for spin - echo no deconvolution of the data with the instrumental resolution is necessary ; it reduces to a simple normalization of the raw data . + in a previous study of the material @xcite ,",
    "the experimental results in the time domain were analyzed by fitting it to a phenomenological formula @xcite .",

    "this approach has been explicitly developed to calculate finite temperature effects on the single particle spectrum in gapped systems .",

    "the operators fulfill a hard - core bosonic commutator relation , i.e. , they commute on different dimers , but on a single dimer only one excitation is allowed at maximum . if the interaction @xmath9 is switched on quantum fluctuations are induced and the triplon excitations become dispersive . + to capture the zero temperature quantum fluctuations",
    "quantitatively we apply a continuous unitary transformation @xcite to map the hamiltonian onto an effective hamiltonian that conserves the number of triplons in the system . to first order in the parameter @xmath19 the effective hamiltonian",

    "since there exists no perturbation theory for hard - core bosons , the excitations are treated as normal bosons , but subject to an infinite on - site interaction to inhibit double occupancies . + the quantity of interest for inelastic neutron scattering is the dynamic structure factor which is related to the imaginary part of the green function by means of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath24,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the momentum in chain direction .",

    "thus it has no significant effect on the line - shape of the excitations and the hard - core interaction is the primary source for the broadening of the single quasi - particle peak .",

    "neutron spin - echo measures the polarization of the neutron beam @xmath42 , which is called the echo amplitude .",

    "+        in summary , we investigated the temperature dependence of the gap mode of copper nitrate , a realization of alternating heisenberg chain , in the time domain . on the experimental side , we used nrse - tas measurements to obtain high resolution data of the time - dependent spin - echo signal . on the theoretical side , we used the diagrammatic brckner approach to calculate the single particle spectral function of the ahc , which was transformed into the time domain to model the time - dependence of the echo - amplitude .",

    "our work shows , that the direct analysis in the time domain is a promising route to understand dynamic correlation and to deepen our understanding of quantum coherence at finite temperature .",
