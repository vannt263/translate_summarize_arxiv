    "the issue of dynamical stability in the context of the three body problem is an intriguing topic , not just from the purely theoretical point of view , but also because it appears in many situations in astronomy , such as planetary dynamics or globular cluster evolution .",
    "it is highly desirable to know whether a triple system is stable or not , but until now , there has not been any global stability criterion and that is due to a number of reasons .",
    "however , throughout the years , various stability criteria have been developed to deal with different situations ( e.g. see georgakarakos 2008 ) .",
    "an effective and useful way of investigating the dynamical stability of a system is by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the numerical integration of the full equations of motion of a triple system has become a popular tool of dynamical astronomy in recent years thanks to the constantly improving power of computers . besides stellar triple systems or triple systems within the limits of our solar system , the discovery of more than 850 exoplanets over the past few years has offered us an additional field for the use of numerical simulations . in many cases ,",
    "the discovered exoplanetary systems seem to have different structural characteristics from our solar system .",
    "planets with eccentric orbits and hot jupiters are frequently present in the planetary systems that have been detected so far . in addition , some close - in transiting exoplanets have been found to have a significant inclination with respect to the stellar rotation axis ( hebrard et al . 2008 , winn et al .",
    "2009 , triaud et al .",
    "2010 , winn et al 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , we have the example of the u and system , where planets c and d have been found to have a mutual inclination of around @xmath4 ( mcarthur et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the effect of the initial inclination on the stability of triple systems has been part of the discussion for some time ( e.g. harrington 1972 ) . since then",
    ", there has been a lot of published work on stability of triple systems ( at an increasing rate in recent years due to the discovery of planetary systems other than ours ) which would consider mutually inclined orbits .",
    "some of that work deals with stellar systems , such as for example eggleton @xmath5 kiseleva ( 1995 ) , who derived an empirical stability condition for hierarchical stability in triple systems , or the more recent work of valtonen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where the authors tested an analytical stability criterion based on the energy change during the encounter between a binary and a single star .",
    "other work investigates the dynamics of planetary systems .",
    "such examples are the papers of pilat - lohinger , funk @xmath5 dvorak ( 2003 ) and of doolin @xmath5 blundell ( 2011 ) , where the stability of p - type orbits in stellar binaries is investigated , the work of veras @xmath5 armitage ( 2004 ) which deals with the dynamics of inclined two planet systems , the work of funk et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , where the authors examine the stability of inclined orbits of terrestrial planets in habitable zones , the paper by marzari , th@xmath6bault @xmath5 scholl ( 2009 ) which deals with planet formation in highly inclined stellar binaries , the work of pilat - lohinger ( 2010 ) , which studies the stability of planets in the habitable zone of inclined multi - planet systems , the paper by funk et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , where the authors investigate the long term evolution of inclined earth - like bodies in a system that consists of a star and a gas giant planet .",
    "in a recent paper ( li , fu @xmath5 sun 2010 ) , it has been suggested that the hill stability boundary of a hierarchical triple system with a low mass inner binary is independent of the initial mutual inclination of the two orbits for certain orbital configurations .",
    "they found that when the eccentricity of the outer binary was not small , the critical semi - major axis ratio was not affected much by the choice of the initial mutual inclination of the hierarchical triple system and as a result of that , they could obtain a rather simple expression for the critical semi - major axis ratio .",
    "an interesting question to answer is whether that holds for general stability as well , i.e. whether there are certain values of the mass parameters and certain initial orbital configurations for which the stability boundary is independent or almost independent of the mutual inclination of the two binaries .",
    "answering that question could be important in many situations in planetary or stellar dynamics , as knowing the values of the parameters of a system is often not possible and also , sometimes we only have some statistical knowledge about them .    here , we attempt to get an answer to the above question by integrating numerically the equations of motion of inclined hierarchical triple systems .",
    "we investigate the stability of triple systems over a wide range of mass ratios and at the moment , we restrict ourselves to systems that are on initially circular orbits .",
    "we investigate the stability of hierarchical triple systems by means of numerical simulations . by hierarchical",
    "we mean a system which consists of a binary ( inner binary ) and a third body moving on a wider orbit ( the third body and the centre of mass of the inner binary constitute the outer binary ) .",
    "the systems integrated are both coplanar and non - coplanar , as the aim of this study is to investigate certain aspects of the effect of the initial orbital inclination on the stability of the system .",
    "we restrict ourselves to initially circular orbits and the bodies are treated as point masses .",
    "no other effects than newtonian gravity are taken into consideration .",
    "we introduce two mass parameters , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the masses of the inner binary . for our experiment , @xmath10 @xmath11 hence , we have 91 different triple systems in terms of the masses .",
    "each system was integrated for eleven different values of the initial mutual inclination angle , i.e. @xmath12 . for each inclination value ,",
    "the system was started at the following eight positions : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the initial relative phase of the two binaries .    in our experiment ,",
    "a system was considered to be unstable when we had escape of at least one body , change of hierarchy or ejection of one of the bodies during the integration time . for a given pair of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and a specific value of the inclination",
    ", we defined four stability categories , depending on how many of the initial starting positions led to a stable or an unstable configuration .",
    "a system fell into the first category if it was stable at all starting positions .",
    "if the system was stable at five , six or seven starting positions , then the system was classified as category two .",
    "a system was placed in the third category when it was stable at one , two , three or four initial positions and finally , when the system was unstable for all starting positions , it was placed in the fourth category .    in order to investigate the stability of a system",
    ", we started from a specific value of the initial period ratio @xmath17 and we progressively moved down to @xmath18 by steps of @xmath19 .",
    "we were not just interested to find the first value of @xmath17 for which the system became unstable , as it is well known that the stability borderline is normally more complicated than that . in order to save computation time , we first did some test simulations at high and low inclinations , in order to get an idea for the choice of the initial period ratio . normally , the maximum initial period ratio we decided to start most of the simulations with was @xmath20 .",
    "however , in certain cases , we started at lower x , in order to save computation time , while in few cases we decided it was necessary to start our simulation with a period ratio @xmath21 .",
    "the time of integration was chosen such that it would cover the longest period of the system at least a few times .",
    "for most systems , that time was set to @xmath22 outer orbit periods .",
    "however , for some systems with smaller @xmath16 , that integration time was not adequate as the systems had much longer time of variation of their orbital elements .",
    "consequently , for those systems , we ran the simulations for much longer times .",
    "table 1 gives the time of integration for all our mass ratios .",
    ".time of integration for the numerical simulations .",
    "the times are given in outer orbital periods and in our system of units the inner binary period is @xmath23 .",
