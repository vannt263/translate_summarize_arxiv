    "in the last decade , there has been an intensive search for new multiferroic materials , in particular those exhibiting ferroelectric ( fe ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) order .",
    "the aim is to find multiferroics with a large magnetoelectric coupling , which could allow the control of magnetization by external electric field .",
    "such materials could be used in future electronic devices including non - volatile memories and spin filters .",
    "unfortunately , most multiferroics exhibit antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order with a weak magnetoelectric coupling or low critical temperatures , and thus they are not suitable for practical applications .",
    "one mechanism that has been demonstrated to produce novel multiferroics is application of an epitaxial strain ( or a comparable perturbation ) to an afm paraelectric material with a large spin - phonon coupling such that the lowest frequency polar phonon with hypothetical ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering has lower frequency than the corresponding phonon in the afm phase .",
    "lowering of the polar phonon frequency by the strain can produce a polar instability in the fm phase , with the resulting energy lowering , which stabilizes a fe - fm multiferroic phase over the bulk afm paraelectric phase.@xcite this has been experimentally confirmed in eutio@xmath10 with a magnetic ordering temperature of 5.3k.@xcite    recently , lee and rabe showed using first - principles calculations that this mechanism would produce a multiferroic phase in srmno@xmath0.@xcite since bulk srmno@xmath0 is afm below t@xmath1=230k,@xcite strained thin films should be fm with critical temperatures above 100 or 150k.@xcite however , due to the very high critical strain ( 3.6% ) , experimental efforts to realize this phase have been so far unsuccessful .",
    "tuning of the polar phonons by a related but different perturbation , negative chemical pressure through continuous substitution of sr by ba , has recently been investigated .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite observed ferroelectricity below 410 k in sr@xmath11ba@xmath12mno@xmath0 single crystals with @xmath13 .",
    "the polar distortion is found to be dominated by displacement of magnetic mn@xmath14 cations ( running counter to the conventional expectation that @xmath15 electrons inhibit off - centering of the cations @xcite ) and therefore the magnetoelectric coupling is the largest attained so far.@xcite however , the magnetic ordering for the ferroelectric phase is g - type afm , so that ferroelectricity is the result of destabilization of the polar mode by strain within the original afm phase , and the system is not a true ( fm - fe ) multiferroic .",
    "the prospects for stabilizing a true multiferroic in srmno@xmath10 or related compounds hinge on better knowledge and control of the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "fortunately , the spin - phonon coupling can be directly investigated experimentally .",

    "<S> infrared reflectivity spectra of cubic srmno@xmath0 ceramics reveal 18% stiffening of the lowest - frequency phonon below the antiferromagnetic phase transition occurring at t@xmath1 = 233k . </S>",
    "<S> such a large temperature change of the polar phonon frequency is extraordinary and we attribute it to an exceptionally strong spin - phonon coupling in this material . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with our prediction from first principles calculations . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> polar phonons become raman active below t@xmath1 , although their activation is forbidden by symmetry in @xmath2 space group . </S>",
    "<S> this gives evidence that the cubic @xmath2 symmetry is locally broken below t@xmath1 due to a strong magnetoelectric coupling . </S>",
    "<S> multiphonon and multimagnon scattering is also observed in raman spectra . </S>",
    "<S> microwave and thz permittivity is strongly influenced by hopping electronic conductivity , which is caused by small non - stoichiometry of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> thermoelectric measurements show room - temperature concentration of free carriers @xmath33.6 10@xmath4 @xmath5 and the sample composition sr@xmath6mn@xmath7mn@xmath8o@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the conductivity exhibits very unusual temperature behavior : thz conductivity increases on cooling , while the static conductivity markedly decreases on cooling . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to different conductivity of the ceramic grains and grain boundaries . </S>"
