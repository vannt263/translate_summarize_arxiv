    "chaotic diffusion associated with the overlap of resonances has been shown to be responsible for instabilities in the solar system ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "for the restricted 3-body problem @xcite first showed that the width of the chaotic zone near a planet could be explained by calculating the location at which the first order mean motion resonances are large enough to overlap .",
    "the zone width has been measured numerical and predicted theoretically @xcite for a planet in a circular orbit , though some work has extended the stability analysis for bodies in orbits near circular and eccentric binary stars @xcite .",
    "the stability of bodies at low eccentricity residing in multiple planet extrasolar systems have also been investigated numerically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that the edge of fomalhaut s eccentric ring could be due to truncation by a 0.1 eccentricity neptune mass planet .",
    "the nearby star fomalhaut hosts a ring of circumstellar material @xcite residing between 120 and 160 au from the star @xcite . _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ infrared observations of fomalhaut reveal a strong brightness asymmetry in the ring @xcite .",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations show that this ring has both a steep and eccentric inner edge @xcite .",
    "the sharp disk edge suggested that the dust particles are in orbits with low free or proper eccentricity , thus the ring has eccentricity equal to the forced eccentricity caused by secular perturbations from the proposed planet .",
    "such a configuration is possible if inelastic collisions in the disk damp the eccentricities of particles , resulting in a particle distribution that moves along nearly closed streamlines or closed and non - self - intersecting orbits .",
    "fomalhaut s ring has a intermediate collision timescale of @xmath0 orbits , estimated from its normal disk opacity @xmath1 m at 24@xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "while previous theoretical and numerical studies have considered orbit stability near the corotation region for planets on circular orbits , little work has been done considering the stability of orbits near a planet on an eccentric orbit .",
    "the dynamical problem of an object orbiting a planet in a circular orbit has a conserved quantity , the jacobi integral , that is not conserved when the planet is on an eccentric orbit .",
    "surfaces of section have been used to illustrate the types of orbits ( tori or area filling ) for the restricted three - body system @xcite . however , when the planet is eccentric there is no extra integral of motion making it difficult to create surfaces of section .",
    "we are motivated here to consider the role of the planet s eccentricity in setting the boundary of non - stochastic orbits in the corotation region .",
    "we focus here on particle orbits that have nearly zero free eccentricity and so have eccentricity set by the forced eccentricity due to secular perturbations from the planet .",
    "numerical integrations were carried out in the plane , using massless and collisionless particles under the gravitational influence of only the star and a massive planet with eccentricity , @xmath3 , using a conventional burlisch - stoer numerical scheme .",
    "a particle near a planet on an eccentric orbit feels secular perturbations from the planet if it is located away from low - order mean motion resonances .",
    "the particle s eccentricity and longitude of periastron precess about a point set by the distance to the planet , the planet s eccentricity longitude of periastron . the secular motion can be described in terms of a free ( or proper ) and forced eccentricity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "only a particle with zero free eccentricity would have a fixed argument of periastron and eccentricity . in our integrations the initial particle eccentricities",
    "were set to the predicted forced eccentricity due to secular perturbations from the planet and the and longitudes of periastron were chosen to be identical to that of the planet .",
    "initial mean anomalies were randomly chosen .",
    "particles were removed from the integration when their eccentricity was larger than @xmath4 .",
    "we work in units of the planet s semi - major axis , @xmath5 , and orbital period .",
    "the mass of the planet is described in terms of its mass ratio , @xmath2 , the ratio of the planet mass to that of the central star .      as a function of initial semi - major axis we measured the lifetimes of particles before removal from the integration .",
    "the semi - major axis bins for each lifetime measurement had width @xmath6 , and 100 particles were integrated for each bin .",
    "an abrupt increase in the particle lifetime was seen in the simulations as a function of initial semi - major axis ( see figure 2 by @xcite ) . inside the chaotic zone particles",
    "were scattered to high eccentricity and removed from the simulation , but outside it , the lifetime of particles exceeded @xmath7 orbits . for planet masses ratio between @xmath8 and @xmath9 and eccentricities between @xmath10 and @xmath11 we measured the semi - major axis , @xmath12 , at which this transition in lifetime occurred .",
    "the distance @xmath13 between this semi - major axis and the planet s divided by the planet s semi - major axis is plotted in figure [ fig : da ] .    .",
    "points are plotted at the semi - major axis at which particles lifetime exceeded @xmath7 orbits .",
    "each point type corresponds to different planet eccentricity .",
    "the points lie on top of one another because the chaotic zone width is independent of the planet eccentricity for orbits with zero free eccentricity .",
    "particles were initially placed in orbits with zero free eccentricity and arguments of peri - astron the same as the planet .",
    "the solid line corresponds to that predicted by equation [ eqn:27 ] .",
    "[ fig : da ] , width=345 ]    in figure [ fig : da ] we note that the chaotic zone boundaries depend on the planet mass .",
    "the scaling is consistent with that predicted from the 2/7 law or @xmath14 @xcite where the constant 1.5 is taken from numerical measurements by @xcite .",
    "the offset between the line predicted by equation [ eqn:27 ] is not significant as we have measured the width from an ensemble of particles and required them all to remain at least @xmath7 orbits .",
    "this implies that we have measured a location outside the last stable orbit in a surface section or a closed orbit radius vs energy bifurcation plot .",
    "the points shown in figure [ fig : da ] include those integrated for a zero eccentricity planet .",
    "so the offset between that predicted by the 2/7th law is the same for the higher planet eccentricities as for the zero planet eccentricity . using finer spacing in semi - major axis and by restricting the initial orbital elements rather than choosing them randomly , it is possible to find stable orbits somewhat closer to the planet .",
    "the offset from the predicted line is caused by the measurement procedure , rather than the planet eccentricity .",
    "we note an increased scatter in the chaotic zone boundary at lower masses in figure [ fig : da ] , however we find no clear trend in the scatter as a function of planet eccentricity",
    ". since the particle lifetimes in the chaotic zone are longer for the lower mass planets more particle trajectories may need to be integrated to achieve the same precision in the measurement of the chaotic zone boundary at lower planet masses .",
    "the choice of initial random mean anomalies could also contribute to the scatter at lower planet masses .",
    "figure [ fig : da ] shows points corresponding to integrations with different planet eccentricities .",
    "the points for integrations near eccentric planets lie on top of those at low or zero planet eccentricity . in other words",
    "the width of the chaotic zone appears to be independent of the planet eccentricity .",
    "we find that there exists a long lived low free eccentricity region near moderately eccentric planets ( in the planar problem ) .",
    "this region has @xmath15 for the more highly eccentric planets and so is nearer the planet s major axis than the planet s periastron . in other words , these orbits pass closer to the star than the periastron of the planet , but because they are apsidally aligned with the orbit of the planet they do not cross the planet s orbit",
    ".    a disk with a low collision rate , could evolve to a distribution with nearly closed orbits fixed about the forced eccentricity and apsidally aligned with a planet .",
    "our planar numerical integrations show that this region is stable over long timescales ( greater than @xmath7 orbits ) and so could host a long lived planetesimal distribution .",
    "we have also measured the eccentricity distribution after @xmath7 planetary orbits in the disk edge .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig : ue ] .",
    "each point shown on this figure correspond to measurements based on integration of 100 particles .",
    "the corotation chaotic region arises from resonance overlap .",
    "however outside the chaotic zone mean motion resonances exist that affect the particles , though because they do not overlap other mean motion resonances the particles do not vary their orbital parameters stochastically or do vary stochastically but on much longer timescales .",
    "figure [ fig : ue ] shows that the velocity dispersion in the stable boundary is likely to depend on planet mass and not eccentricity .",
    ", in the disk edge as a function of planet mass .",
    "the line shown is @xmath16 and consistent with that predicted with equation [ eqn : ue ] for particles near a planet in a circular orbit .",
    "each point type corresponds to integrations containing a planet with a different eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricity dispersion is not strongly dependent on the planet eccentricity .",
    "[ fig : ue ] , width=336 ]    to characterize the lifetime of particles in the chaotic zone we consider particles within initial semi - major axis at 2/3 the distance in semi - major axis to the zone edge .",
    "the timescale for removal of 25% , 50% and 75% of the particles is plotted as a function planet mass for planet eccentricities , @xmath17 and 0.2 in figure [ fig : life ] .",
    "again particles are initial started in orbits with zero free eccentricity . from comparing figure [ fig : life ] , we see no significant difference in the particle lifetimes at the two planet eccentricities . particles placed into the chaotic zone at zero free eccentricity , would have the a similar resident lifetime as those placed at zero eccentricity near a planet of zero eccentricity .     and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the circles , crosses and triangles correspond to times when 75% , 50% and 25% of the particles remain in the simulation , respectively",
    ". the line shown has lifetime equal to @xmath18 .",
    "particles have initial angle of pericenter identical to that of the planet and zero free eccentricity .",
    "the lifetimes are not strongly dependent on the planet eccentricity .",
    "[ fig : life ] , width=336 ]    for orbits with eccentricity equal to the forced eccentricity we find that there is a long lived or stable region in close proximity to eccentric planets . inside this region particles",
    "are pumped to high eccentricity and scattered by the planet on a timescale orders of magnitude faster than outside this region .",
    "we have found that the width of this chaotic zone , in semi - major axis is independent of the planet eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricity dispersion in the disk edge and the lifetime of particles within the zone is also nearly independent of planet eccentricity .",
    "these results suggest there is a similarity in the dynamics of particles at zero free eccentricity and those at zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit . in the following section we explore a hamiltonian formulation that shows that this is in fact the case .",
    "in this section we reconsider the theory of mean motion resonance overlap .",
    "we consider the role of first order secular perturbations from the planet and the two angular perturbations that are associated with each first order mean motion resonance .",
    "we follow the notation by @xcite .",
    "we employ the poincar coordinates @xmath19 and their associated momenta @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass of the star , @xmath22 is the mean longitude , @xmath23 is the mean anomaly , @xmath24 is the longitude of pericenter , @xmath25 is the semimajor axis , and @xmath26 is the eccentricity .",
    "these variables are those describing the orbit of a particle or planetesimal in a plane .",
    "the hamiltonian for the keplerian system in these coordinates restricted to a plane is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the disturbing function , proportional to the planet mass , that depends on the coordinates of the particle and on the coordinates of the planet .",
    "the planet s semimajor axis and mass are denoted @xmath5 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the planet s other coordinates are subscripted in the same way . the mean motion of the particle @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the derivative with respect to time of @xmath22 .",
    "hereafter we adopt a unit convention with distances in units of the planet s semi - major axis , @xmath5 .",
    "time is put in units of @xmath32 .",
    "we define @xmath2 to be the mass ratio @xmath33 . at low eccentricity , @xmath34 , relating the momentum @xmath35 to the particle eccentricity .",
    "we often give the particle semimajor axis in terms of the variable @xmath36 if @xmath37 ( external to the planet ) and @xmath38 for @xmath39 ( internal to the planet ) .    the unperturbed hamiltonian or that lacking the disturbing function @xmath40 we consider the the @xmath41 exterior mean motion resonance ( planet is an interior perturber ) .",
    "we perform a canonical transformation using the mixed variable generating function @xmath42 where @xmath43 , leading to new variables variable definition by @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath44 and new hamiltonian @xmath45    we now expand around a particular value for @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 in terms of the particles mean motion @xmath48 .",
    "since we have adopted units @xmath49 , we find @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "our hamiltonian now reads @xmath52 we can write the unperturbed hamiltonian as @xmath53 with coefficients @xmath54 similar to equation 2 by @xcite .",
    "exactly on resonance @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the primes here are given to differentiate @xmath57 from the semi - major axis @xmath25 .",
    "we now recover the disturbing function that is is traditionally expanded as a cosine series of angles in orders of planet and particle eccentricity .",
    "we keep the terms inducing precession of the longitude of periapse and first order ( in eccentricity ) or @xmath58 terms containing @xmath59 and @xmath24 .",
    "the full hamiltonian @xmath60 where @xmath61 and with the following coefficients should have had a factor of @xmath62 . ] @xmath63 the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given in table b.7 by @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are laplace coefficients and are functions of @xmath68 .",
    "the approximate asymptotic limits for large @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have used the approximation @xmath73 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath74 is often called the @xmath26-resonance since @xmath75 .",
    "the other term can be called an @xmath76-resonance or a corotation resonance since it does not depend on the particle s longitude of perihelion or @xmath24 .",
    "we first consider secular perturbations only , ignoring the @xmath77 terms and considering the following @xmath78 we find a fixed point at @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "this fixed point is equivalent to a closed orbit with eccentricity equal to the forced eccentricity @xmath81 and zero free eccentricity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath82 sets the secular precession rate .",
    "we can perform canonical transformations to new variables @xmath83 these variables were also used by @xcite . here",
    "the momentum variable @xmath46 is related to the particle s free or proper eccentricity rather than the particle s eccentricity .",
    "recovering the hamiltonian ( equation [ eqn : hamgen ] ) in the new variables @xmath84 the expansion about the fixed point associated with the forced eccentricity does not change the form of the term normally associated with the first order mean motion resonance , that proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "consequently the resonance libration time and width are unchanged . the predicted semi - major axis where resonance overlap occurs based on these resonance widths would be identical to that for a planet in a circular orbit ( see below ) .",
    "however the width of the corotation resonance differs from that predicted using equation ( [ eqn : hamgen ] ) .",
    "the coefficient describing the strength of this resonance ( @xmath86 in equation [ eqn : hamgeni ] ) , can be rewritten as @xmath87 using the coefficients listed in equations ( [ eqn : gcofs ] ) .",
    "since @xmath65 and @xmath64 have opposite signs the forced eccentricity term will tend to cancel the other term . in the high @xmath69 limit",
    "the forced eccentricity equals the planet s eccentricity and @xmath88 so these two terms cancel .",
    "the @xmath89 law is only valid for the high @xmath69 limit .",
    "consequently the corotation resonance completely cancels near the planet for orbits with zero free eccentricity .",
    "this implies that the dynamics of particles at low eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit is similar to the dynamics of particles at low free eccentricity near a planet in an eccentric orbit .",
    "we note that our expansion above is valid only to first order in the particle and planet eccentricity . at high particle and planet eccentricity ,",
    "additional resonance terms become important , and the low eccentricity expansion is no longer valid .",
    "the above hamiltonian ( equation [ eqn : hamgeni ] ) is not restricted to zero free eccentricity but to low values of the free eccentricity due to the low degree of the expansion .",
    "in section 2 we numerically measured the eccentricity dispersion in the disk edge , finding that it too does not significantly depend upon planet eccentricity .",
    "outside the chaos zone , planetesimals still experience perturbations from the planet .",
    "these perturbations have a characteristic size set by size of perturbations in the nearest mean - motion resonance that is not wide enough to overlap others and so is not part of the chaotic zone . since particles in the edge",
    "reside outside the chaotic zone , the velocity dispersion does not increase with time . in this subsection",
    "we check that our formulation can correctly predict the location of resonance overlap .",
    "we then predict eccentricity variations that would be predicted by considering the role of the last resonance that is not part of the chaotic zone .",
    "the width of the resonance can be thought of as the range of semi - major axis over which the resonance has a large effect . to estimate the first order resonance width we rescale the momentum and put the hamiltonian in a unitless form ( e.g. , as done by @xcite in section 8.8 or by @xcite in section 3 ) .",
    "the factors used to rescale the hamiltonian set the resonance width .",
    "we perform a canonical transformation of the hamiltonian given in equation ( [ eqn : hamgeni ] ) lacking the corotation term or @xmath90 with generating function @xmath91 leading to new variables @xmath92 and new hamiltonian @xmath93 note that @xmath94 is conserved and is small for initial conditions near resonance with small initial free eccentricity ( or @xmath46 ) .",
    "dropping constant terms and setting @xmath95 the hamiltonian in equation ( [ oneterm_g ] ) becomes @xmath96 here the coefficient @xmath97 determines the distance from resonance . by rescaling momentum and time",
    "@xmath98 we can write this as @xmath99 where @xmath100 sets the distance from exactly on resonance . the resonance is only strong over a range @xmath101 ( e.g. , see figure 8.10 by @xcite ) corresponding to a range of particle mean motions . assuming slow secular precession and neglecting the term @xmath102 , the variation @xmath103 ( equation [ eqn : b ] ) .",
    "equation [ eqn : coefs ] allows us to relate @xmath104 to the range of mean motions over which the resonance is strong @xmath105 . equation [ eqn : barb ]",
    "then implies that the resonance is strong over a range of mean motions of size @xmath106 for resonances near the planet we can use the asymptotic limit ( @xmath70 , @xmath69 large ) that gives @xmath107 .",
    "subbing in for @xmath108 and considering the range of semi - major axis rather than mean motion , the resonance width is @xmath109 where we have used @xmath110 . using a spacing between @xmath111 resonances of @xmath112",
    "we find that the resonances overlap at the resonance with @xmath113 the semi - major axis corresponding to the @xmath111 resonance at the chaotic zone boundary is set by the above @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath111 mean motion resonance located at a semi - major axis of @xmath114 for large @xmath69 .",
    "the distance between the planet and chaotic zone boundary , @xmath115 , in semi - major axis , i.e. , chaotic zone width , is then @xmath116 recovering the 2/7 law @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity change or libration width in the resonance just outside the boundary would have size @xmath117 where we have used the libration width ( given by the scaling factor for @xmath118 in equation [ eqn : rescale ] ) or @xmath119 subbing in @xmath120 at the chaotic zone boundary gives @xmath121 and an eccentricity dispersion of @xmath122 just outside the chaos zone .",
    "this dispersion could set the slope of the density distribution in the disk edge ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling predicted by equation [ eqn : ue ] is shown compared to numerical measurements of the eccentricity dispersion in the disk edge in figure [ fig : ue ] .",
    "it provides a good fit to the measurements and is independent of planet eccentricity as predicted by considering equation [ eqn : hamgeni ] for orbits with low free eccentricity .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the dynamics of low free eccentricity collisionless massless particles in the plane near a planet on a eccentric orbit . by determining the semi - major axis at which the particle lifetime increases",
    ", we measure the width of the chaotic zone near the planet . for eccentricity @xmath123",
    "we find that the chaotic zone width is independent of the planet s eccentricity and matches that predicted by the 2/7 law .",
    "the eccentricity dispersion in the disk edge and the lifetime of particles within the chaotic zone is also nearly independent of planet eccentricity .",
    "these results suggest there is a similarity in the dynamics of particles at zero free eccentricity and those at zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit .    to account for our numerical results",
    "we have explored the dynamics of a hamiltonian system that takes into account first order secular perturbations and the two terms that comprise each first order mean motion resonance . with a coordinate transformation",
    "we have rewritten the hamiltonian in terms of an action variable that depends on the free eccentricity rather than the eccentricity . at low free eccentricity",
    "we find that the new hamiltonian resembles the hamiltonian of a low eccentricity particle near a planet in a circular orbit .",
    "this accounts for the lack of sensitivity of the particle dynamics on planet eccentricity .    for orbits with eccentricity equal to the forced eccentricity there is a region in the plane with",
    "longer lived orbits ( compared to the planet orbital period ) in close proximity to eccentric planets .",
