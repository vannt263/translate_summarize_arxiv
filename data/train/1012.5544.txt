    "metallic single - electron transistors ( sets ) have found several applications including charge detectors and amplifiers  @xcite , electron pumps for metrology  @xcite , and low - temperature thermometers  @xcite .",
    "more recently , single dopants in silicon have emerged as promising candidates for qubits of the ultimately small size  @xcite .",
    "silicon technology offers the opportunity both to realize classical sets  @xcite and to probe single dopants  @xcite .",
    "the use of the set for quantum - mechanical measurement of the dopant qubit requires characterization of the coupling strength between set and dopant atom .",
    "here we study the mutual capacitive and tunnel couplings between a dopant atom and a set , realized in a silicon nanowire field - effect transistor .",
    "the interplay between coulomb interaction and tunneling is most thoroughly studied in mesoscopic physics  @xcite , where it leads to the so - called coulomb blockade ( cb ) oscillations  @xcite of conductance , commonly observed in metallic sets  @xcite and semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the energy scale governing the cb oscillations in a metallic set is set by the charging energy @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total capacitance of the set island relative to the surrounding conductors , and @xmath2 is the electron charge . at temperatures @xmath3 , the conductance",
    "as a function of the gate voltage acquires an oscillatory component and , with lowering the temperature , it turns into a series of spikes ( cb peaks ) , at @xmath4 . at the lowest temperatures , the height of a cb peak depends on the properties of the electron wave function inside the set ; namely , on its values at the contacts .",
    "the peak height changes randomly from peak to peak , due to the chaotic nature of the electron motion ( and wave functions ) inside the set .",
    "such mesoscopic fluctuations of the cb peaks persist up to temperatures on the order of the single - particle level spacing , @xmath5 , of the set .",
    "it is convenient to distinguish between sets and quantum dots by the magnitude of @xmath5 : sets are devices in which @xmath6 and an intermediate temperature regime , @xmath7 , is possible , whereas quantum dots are devices in which @xmath8 .",
    "the existence of the temperature regime @xmath7 makes sets outstanding candidates for applications .    in the temperature regime @xmath7 ,",
    "the mesoscopic fluctuations of the cb peaks are suppressed .",
    "the cb peaks have equal height , which is determined by the transparencies of the set tunnel barriers , and thus , it is independent on the details of the electron motion inside the set island .",
    "the peak height remains constant over a large number of cb oscillations and may vary weakly with the gate voltage due to the way the gate couples to the set tunnel barriers .",
    "a strong modulation of the peak height on a scale of several cb oscillations is usually considered as an anomaly in this regime .",
    "such anomalies in the cb oscillations have been attributed to charge traps , which may be present in the set surrounding  @xcite .",
    "charge traps is a common and , typically , unwanted ingredient in modern electronic nanodevices .",
    "their most conspicuous collective effect is the voltage switch , which makes devices difficult to control . in silicon nanostructures based on doping modulation ,",
    "charge traps occur naturally at the borders of the doped regions , where the dopants are likely to diffuse away from their majority distribution and form nearly isolated charge traps . in this paper , we study the effects associated with a single charge trap ( a dopant atom ) in the cb oscillations of a set .",
    "we observe an interplay between mutual capacitive coupling and tunneling in the silicon set coupled to a dopant atom .",
    "in particular , we observe a spectacular enhancement of the conductance through the set when transport occurs by resonant tunneling via the dopant atom .",
    "we develop a theory which takes into account both tunneling and capacitive coupling between dopant atom and set , and assess the coupling strengths by analyzing the cb oscillations of the linear conductance .",
