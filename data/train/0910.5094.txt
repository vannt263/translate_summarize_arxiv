    "the electroweak theory is highly overconstrained , with three fundamental parameters at tree level @xcite and more than a dozen precise measurements of quantities derived from these parameters @xcite .",
    "the experimental precision of these measurements , typically at the @xmath2 level , is sufficient to probe for loop interactions of both observed and unobserved particles .",
    "ongoing and future measurements at the fermilab tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will improve the accuracy of several quantities at the loop level .",
    "the mixing angle between the electromagnetic and weak symmetries , accessed through forward - backward lepton asymmetries , could have a reduced uncertainty from the full tevatron data set @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 boson mass and width have been measured most precisely by the d  @xcite and cdf @xcite experiments , respectively , with accuracies that will significantly improve with the larger available data sets .",
    "the combined tevatron top - quark mass measurement has a relative precision of 0.75% @xcite .    of these measurements ,",
    "the @xmath0 boson mass has the greatest potential in the near term to significantly tighten constraints on unobserved particles @xcite .",
    "the combination of existing measurements gives @xmath3 gev @xcite , and future cdf and d  measurements using data already collected will be at least this precise .",
    "including predictions from the lhc , hadron - collider measurements expect @xmath4 mev precision @xcite , or about a factor of three reduction of the current uncertainty .",
    "a reduction of @xmath5 uncertainty will directly constrain the properties of new particles .",
    "the tree - level prediction @xmath6 gev is more than @xmath7 from the measured value .",
    "an important loop correction arises from the top - bottom loop , due to the large mass difference @xmath8 , with the correction proportional to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the correction arising from higgs boson loops is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "table  [ tbl : inputs ] shows the shift in @xmath5 due to a doubling of @xmath11 and to @xmath12 shifts in several inputs to @xmath5 @xcite .",

[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     combining all tevatron measurements gives @xcite : @xmath16    which is more precise than the combined lep measurement of @xmath17 gev .",
    "the current world - average value of @xmath5 is @xcite @xmath18",
    "several groups have updated their fits to the global electroweak data using the latest @xmath5 measurements .",
    "the gfitter group has obtained a best - fit higgs boson mass @xmath19 gev @xcite , more than @xmath20 below the lep direct exclusion @xmath21 gev @xcite .",
    "there is thus tension between the electroweak fits and @xmath11 , and this tension increases if one only considers the predictions from @xmath5 alone .",
    "the gfitter group has fit for @xmath11 using only one sensitive variable at a time , and obtains @xmath22 gev when using only @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gfitter ] ) .",
    "in fact , all measurements prefer a low - mass higgs , except the forward - backward asymmetry measurement in polarized electron - positron collisions .",
    "the gfitter group has determined the probability of such a deviant measurement to be 1.4% , if due to measurement uncertainties alone .",
    "preferred by measurements of the forward - backward lepton asymmetry in @xmath23 collisions at lep and sld , the forward - backward @xmath24quark asymmetry at sld , and the @xmath5 measurement .",
    "all variables sensitive to @xmath11 are removed from the fit except for the one quoted @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    given the tension between the electroweak fits and the direct limit on @xmath11 , it is natural to consider possible new - physics contributions to @xmath5 .",
    "one possibility is the presence of supersymmetric - particle loops in the @xmath0 boson propagator .",
    "such loops in the minimal supersymmetric standard model increase the @xmath0-boson mass and reduce this tension .",
    "figure  [ fig : mssm ] shows the range of top - quark and @xmath0-boson masses preferred by the mssm and by the sm @xcite",
    ". however , there are other constraints on supersymmetry that create a different set of tensions .     and @xmath13 ( blue circle ) , and smaller ellipses for future @xmath5 uncertainties of 15 mev ( black circle ) and 10 mev ( red circle ) @xcite .",
    "an uncertainty of 10 mev would exclude values of the sm higgs above the current direct lower limit of 114 gev .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "in addition to the expected improvement in @xmath5 precision from analysis of the complete tevatron datasets , even greater precision is predicted by the atlas experiment at the lhc . with 10 fb@xmath25 of @xmath26 tev data ( one year of running at design luminosity )",
    ", the atlas experiment expects to have a precision of 7 mev on its measurement of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , there are significant challenges to achieving this goal . for example",
    ", the atlas projection is based on the charged - lepton @xmath27 fit for a single decay channel and assumes the recoil uncertainty is negligible . however",
    ", both the cdf and d  measurements find a larger recoil uncertainty on this mass fit than on the fit to the @xmath28 distribution , due to the tight cut on the recoil momentum in the event selection .",
    "thus , one would expect a non - negligible recoil uncertainty for the atlas measurement .",
    "in addition , atlas expects the @xmath29 uncertainty to dominate the production model uncertainty , with a negligible pdf uncertainty .",
    "given the large uncertainties on the pdfs at the momentum fraction relevant for @xmath0 boson production at the lhc , this projection appears optimistic .",
    "even though there will be significant challenges to overcome for measuring @xmath5 at atlas and cms , there will be @xmath30- and @xmath31-boson events to calibrate the detector response to leptons and recoil , and to measure the @xmath1 boson rapidity and @xmath27 distributions to constrain the pdfs and @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , there is a @xmath0 boson charge asymmetry at the lhc which is similar to that of the tevatron , providing further possible pdf constraints .",
    "given these large statistics and calibration tools , it is realistic to expect a measurement with precision better than 10 mev from the lhc experiments .    finally , there is potential for a precision measurement of the weak mixing angle from the forward - backward asymmetry of leptons in drell - yan production at the tevatron .",
    "the distribution of the angle @xmath32 between the negative - lepton and proton momenta has the form @xcite : @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the asymmetry between negative leptons produced in the forward ( @xmath35 ) and backward ( @xmath36 ) directions , and is a function of the vector and axial couplings of the fermions to the @xmath1 and @xmath37 bosons . since the vector coupling is equal to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the weak charge , the measurement provides sensitivity to the weak mixing angle .",
    "cdf and d  have performed measurements of @xmath34 in the electron decay channel with 72 pb@xmath25 @xcite and 1.1 fb@xmath25 @xcite of data , respectively .",
    "assuming statistical scaling of the uncertainties on the d  measurement , @xmath40    the combined tevatron precision using electron and muon channels in @xmath41 fb@xmath25 of data could approach 0.0003 , which would contribute to the world - average value of @xmath42 .",
    "the model of electroweak unification has been tested to high precision , and is now used to constrain the existence and properties of unobserved particles coupling to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons .",
    "further progress relies on improving the measurement of the @xmath0 boson mass , whose uncertainty is the limiting factor in these constraints .",
    "measurements at the tevatron have recently reduced this uncertainty significantly , with further reduction expected from analysis of the existing data . in order to achieve the stated goal of a measurement more precise than the current world average ,",
    "the tevatron experiments require improvements in the model of @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production .",
    "ongoing theoretical work and recent production measurements should produce the needed improvements .",
    "ultimately , the lhc should produce a measurement of @xmath5 with better than 10 mev precision . at that point , other uncertainties on parameters in the electroweak fits will need to be revisited , for example the uncertainty on the electromagnetic coupling @xmath43 , evaluated at the @xmath1 boson mass .",
    "another possibility for improving electroweak constraints is the determination of @xmath44 through the measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry of drell - yan at the tevatron .",
    "however , much work is required to demonstrate the scaling of uncertainties with an order of magnitude more data , and to achieve sensitivity in the muon decay channel .",
    "overall , there is significant ongoing progress in precision electroweak measurements at hadron colliders .",
    "the constraints on the higgs boson mass are quickly tightening , and if there is no sm higgs there is a reasonable possibility that it will be first excluded by the @xmath0 boson mass measurement .",
