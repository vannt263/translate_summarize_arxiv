    "we can make the predictions about the stability and excitation gaps of the fqhe .",
    "for example , for the @xmath57-fqhe the main parameter which determines the formation the incompressible liquid is the ratio of the pseudopotentials at @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "the smaller the ratio the larger the excitation gaps , and consequently the more stable are the fqhe states . comparing the pseudopotentials of the non - relativistic electrons at @xmath1 and @xmath34",
    "we can conclude that the fqhe gaps in the first landau level , @xmath1 should be smaller then the corresponding gaps in the zeroth landau level , @xmath34 .",
    "the behavior of the pseudopotentials for the relativistic electrons in the higher landau levels is similar to that of the relativistic ones .",
    "the exception is the properties of the pseudopotential in the first landau level , @xmath1 .",
    "we notice in fig .  1 that the pseudopotentials in the first landau level ( @xmath1 ) is larger than the corresponding pseudopotentials in the zeroth landau level , @xmath34 , for all values of the relative angular momentum , i.e. @xmath56 . the pseudopotential in the @xmath1 landau level is also a monotonic function of @xmath28 .",
    "this is different from the non - relativistic case .",
    "another important property of the pseudopotential of the relativistic system is that the ratio @xmath60 is the smallest in the first landau level , @xmath1 . in fig .  2 we present the results for the pseudopotentials of the relativistic system in the lowest landau levels . from this figure",
    "we can also see that the ratio @xmath60 is the smallest for @xmath1 .",
    "based on this property of @xmath61 we can conclude that the largest gap of the 1/3-fqhe state should be expected in the _ first _ landau level , @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the fqhe in the relativistic system should be easier to observe in the first landau level , but not in the zeroth landau level as in the case of the non - relativistic electrons .    . , width=340 ]    due to the presence of both the spin and the valley degeneracies the graphene system becomes more complicated than the standard non - relativistic electron system , where only the spin degree of freedom is present . in a magnetic field",
    "the spin degeneracy can be lifted due to the zeeman energy , leaving the landau levels of the graphene system doubly degenerate due to the valley index .",
    "mathematically , the system then becomes equivalent to a double layer non - relativistic system , where the valley index is the layer index .",
    "usually , in the double - layer system there is an asymmetry in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "this means that the interaction strength between the electrons in the same layers is different from that in different layers .",
    "this is due to a finite separation between the layers . comparing this property of a double layer system to the graphene system",
    "we can say that the graphene system is a double - layer system with zero separation between the layers .",
    "so the system is completely su(2)-pseudospin symmetric , where the pseudospin is associated with the valley index .",
    "but this is not entirely true .",
    "there is an asymmetry in the graphene system as well .",
    "one of the types of asymmetry is related to the lattice structure of graphene  the interaction between the electrons in the same sublattice is stronger than the interaction between the electrons in different sublattices@xcite .    to estimate the corrections due to the asymmetry related to the lattice structure of graphene we assume that the electrons are localized at the discrete points corresponding to the lattice structure of the graphene .",
    "then the interaction matrix element , @xmath62 , between the single - electrons states , @xmath63 , can be expressed in the following form @xmath64 where the index @xmath65 in the wavefunction @xmath63 indicates collectively the landau level , valley , sublattice , and intra - landau level indices .",

    "this introduces the difference in the interaction strength between the electrons in the same sublattice and in different sublattices . in terms of the pseudopotentials",
    "this means that if the pseudopotential is calculated between the states of different sublattices then @xmath69 in the expression ( [ vm ] ) should contain an additional factor @xmath70 and the integral over @xmath71 should be replaced by the 2d integral over @xmath72 .    in the zeroth landau level , @xmath34 , the electrons in the valley",

    "the appearance of the undamped plasmon mode in the presence of the soi is a result of the interplay between the intra- and the inter - band correlations which can be adjusted by varying the temperature of the system in experiments . to show the temperature range in which an undamped plasmon mode exists , in fig .",
    "[ fig : et ] we plot @xmath160 ( dotted curve ) and @xmath161 ( solid curve ) as functions of the temperature @xmath162 at @xmath163 @xmath164 . for @xmath165 mev ,",
    "an increase of the temperature from @xmath166 leads to an increase of the ratio of the intra- to the inter - band correlation while @xmath153 in the ehc gap ( @xmath167 ) decreases and crosses zero .",
    "there is no undamped plasmon mode when the inter - band correlation dominates at @xmath168 k and when the intra - band correlation dominates at @xmath169 k. in the temperature regime 1.1 k @xmath170 k or @xmath171 when the intra- and inter - band correlations match , however , @xmath172 while @xmath173 and one undamped plasmon mode exists .    in summary : calculating the dynamic dielectric function taking into account the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction in graphene , we have studied the collective excitations in graphene .",
    "the dirac electronic system in graphene is converted into a narrow gap semiconductor with chiral property by the spin - orbit interaction . as a result ,",
    "an undamped collective excitation was found to exist in the spectral gap of the single - particle continuum and is perhaps observable in the experiments .",
    "more detailed results can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "there have been a steady flow of reports in the literature on the electronic properties of graphene .",
    "interestingly , our soi - dependent dielectric function has recently been employed to explore the possibility of wigner crystallization in graphene@xcite .",
