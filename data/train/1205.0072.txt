    "colloid - polymer mixtures occupy a special place in soft matter physics @xcite .",
    "the introduction of non - adsorbing polymer introduces an effective attraction between the colloids whose strength and range can be tuned by altering the concentration and molecular weight , respectively , of the polymer @xcite .",
    "the existence of this entropy driven ` depletion ' attraction opens up a vast swathe of behaviour inaccessible to colloidal systems with purely repulsive interactions , such that colloid - polymer mixtures may be regarded as true `` model atomic systems '' @xcite .",
    "the best known examples include liquid - gas phase separation @xcite but there are also phenomena not seen in atomic systems such as gelation @xcite and re - entrant glassy dynamics at high density @xcite .",
    "real - space analysis at the particle level has enabled direct observation of crystallisation @xcite , and behaviour related to liquid - gas phase separation such as capillary wave fluctuations at ( colloidal ) liquid - gas interfaces @xcite and fluid critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "moreover colloid - polymer mixtures with a relatively short - ranged attractive interaction can ( crudely ) model proteins and may exhibit two - step crystal nucleation phenomena @xcite , to which we return below .    theoretical treatments of colloid - polymer mixtures are based largely on the asakura - oosawa - vrij ( ao ) model @xcite which treats the colloid - colloid interaction as that of hard - spheres ( hs ) and the polymer - polymer interaction as ideal , i.e. the polymer coils are assumed to be perfectly interpenetrating spheres . however , the polymer spheres have an excluded volume ( hard ) interaction with the hs colloids .",
    "this model binary ( ao ) mixture provides the simplest , zeroth - order description of the real mixture .",
    "it is characterized by the size ratio @xmath1 , where sigma is the colloid diameter and @xmath2 is the polymer sphere diameter .",
    "the colloid - polymer interaction is infinite for separations @xmath3 . from simulation and theoretical studies",
    "it is well - known that for sufficiently large size ratios , @xmath4 , the ao model exhibits phase separation into a colloid - rich ( liquid ) and a colloid - poor ( gas ) phase at sufficiently high polymer volume fractions . for smaller size ratios",
    "this phase transition becomes metastable w.r.t .",
    "the fluid - crystal transition@xcite .",
    "the same trend in phase behaviour ( with @xmath2 set equal to twice the radius of gyration of the non - adsorbing polymer ) is found in experimental studies@xcite .",
    "in addition to predicting purely entropy driven fluid - fluid phase separation the ao model exhibits the elegant feature that for size ratios @xmath5 the degrees of freedom of the ideal polymer can be integrated out exactly and the binary mixture maps formally to a one - component system of colloids described by an effective hamiltonian containing only one and two - body ( pair ) contributions @xcite .",
    "the former contribution plays no role in determining phase equilibrium or structure , for a uniform ( bulk ) fluid , but does determine the total pressure and compressibility @xcite .",

    "( vrefeqao).the polymer fugacity @xmath12 is equal to the number density @xmath13 of ideal polymers in the reservoir at the given chemical potential @xmath14 . as noted already , in relating the ao model to experiment",
    ", one usually sets @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the polymer radius of gyration .",
    "hitherto , most work on colloidal - polymer mixtures was carried out at a fixed temperature , typically around 25 @xmath17c .",
    "_ effective _ temperature is varied by changing the interaction strength .",
    "the effective temperature is inversely proportional to the depth of the attractive well of the interaction potential in ( eq . [ eqao ] ) , and is therefore fixed for a given polymer reservoir density . scanning a phase diagram",
    "then requires preparation of a considerable number of different samples .",
    "conversely , in molecular systems , interactions are usually constant over the ( broad ) temperature range of interest , one sample is prepared and temperature is used as a control parameter .    in our present study",
    "we note that colloid - polymer mixtures can respond to temperature in an intriguing and counter - intuitive manner .",
    "the effective temperature in eq .",
    "( [ eqao ] ) is set by @xmath12 which in turn is equal to the polymer number density for ideal polymers .",
    "real systems approximate this behaviour very well @xcite .",
    "thus the primary response of the system to temperature is given by the response of the polymer depletant , since the polymer - polymer interactions are weak and colloid - colloid interactions are athermal ( hard sphere ) .",
    "now , close to ( but above ) their theta temperature @xmath18 , polymers expand ( @xmath16 increases ) upon heating ( fig .",
    "[ figrgt ] ) .",
    "this expansion has two effects : firstly , the polymer - colloid size ratio @xmath19 increases , thereby increasing the range of attraction , and secondly , the polymer reservoir volume fraction @xmath20 also increases .",
    "since the well - depth @xmath21 this means the effective temperature falls strongly for a modest increase in polymer size which leads to a paradoxical result , namely raising the temperature of a colloid - polymer mixture near @xmath18 brings about a strong _ effective cooling_. although this effect has been exploited to drive phase transitions in mixtures of colloidal rods and polymers @xcite , these temperature - dependent depletion interactions have received relatively little attention .",
    "this is in contrast to other means of controlling the attractive interactions between colloids in - situ , such as the critical casimir effect@xcite and multiaxial electric fields @xcite .",
    "we note that in - situ control of attractive interactions , combined with particle - resolved studies , has the power to provide much new insight into a variety of phenomena , including phase transitions @xcite .    here",
    "we make a quantitative experimental investigation , at the single - particle level , of the effect of temperature on an already well - studied colloid - polymer mixture .",
    "the elucidation of our results requires theoretical underpinning and we shall base this on the ao model described above .",
    "specifically we investigate a mixture where the size ratio is about 0.2 but varies by 10 percent or so on changing temperature .",
    "the size ratio is such that the fluid - fluid transition is metastable w.r.t . the fluid - solid transition and therefore we consider out of equilibrium phenomena associated with metastable states . a recent simulation study @xcite provides a helpful framework for placing our results in context .",
    "these authors study the effective one - component ao model , where the pair - potential is given by eq(1 ) , for @xmath22 which is in the regime where the mapping to the effective one - component description using only a pair potential is exact . by changing the polymer reservoir density , equivalent to changing the depth of the attractive potential well",
    ", they determine both equilibrium and out - of equilibrium ` phase diagrams ' . more specifically , using monte carlo and brownian dynamics , they investigate crystal nucleation and the onset of gelation in the vicinity of the metastable fluid - fluid binodal .",
    "they present convincing evidence that crystallization is enhanced by the binodal .",
    "we tackle the same issues in our experiments on a real colloid - polymer mixture , seeking to ascertain what role proximity to the binodal plays in forming gels and in determining crystal nucleation rates .",
    "it is well - known that in experiments equilibrium is often not reached and in particular gelation can occur .",
    "this phenomenon has been linked to spinodal decomposition associated with colloidal gas - liquid condensation @xcite ; gels are supposed to form within the metastable fluid - fluid spinodal .",
    "it follows that knowledge of the critical point is important in predicting where gelation might occur @xcite .",
    "the connection between critical density fluctuations and crystal nucleation rates in short - ranged attractive systems , where the gas - liquid critical point is metastable with respect to crystallisation , has received considerable attention since it was elucidated by ten wolde and frenkel @xcite .",
    "critical fluctuations are expected to enhance the nucleation rate and may be responsible for the strong temperature dependence of nucleation rates found in globular proteins @xcite .",
    "a two - step nucleation process is envisaged where nuclei preferentially form in fluctuations of high density since the surface tension between the nucleus and the surrounding fluid is smaller .",
    "the reduction in free energy barrier to nucleation associated with such density fluctuations has been measured in a 2d depletion system @xcite . here",
    "we investigate crystallisation in the neighbourhood of the metastable critical point .",
