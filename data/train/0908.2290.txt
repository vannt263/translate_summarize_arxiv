    "the search of optimization in evolutionary processes is a rather popular idea in evolution research @xcite . here",
    "we should distinguish the optimization via mutation rate @xcite and via fitness landscapes @xcite .",
    "the first is rather relevant for the real biology . according to darwinian view to evolution , the force driving evolution is the natural selection , not the creation of genetic variants , because the mutations are random .",
    "nevertheless there have been experimental results which suggest that mutation rates can vary , e.g. increasing during certain stresses @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been called `` adaptive mutation '' , which means that the mutation rate is under the selective pressure @xcite .",
    "we will give the theory of optimal mutation rates in case of infinite populations .",
    "the realistic case , of cause , is connected with the finite population , and our results could be considered just as a first step in that direction .    from the early days of darwin - wallace evolution theory [ 8 ]",
    "there has been a hope that there is some optimization of the fitness during the evolution process .",
    "such picture really was confirmed in the case of proteins @xcite . in connection with [ 3 ]",
    "has been considered a mathematical problem .",
    "what has been examined was a direct parallelism with the famous brachistochrone problem suggested in 1696 by johann bernoulli . given two mutants , a and b , separated by _",
    "n _ mutational steps , what is the evolutionary trajectory which allows a homogeneous infinite population of a to reach b in the shortest time ? in @xcite has been considered an approximate solution of the mathematical problem in the case of finite population , considering an optimization via fitness landscape . to find an optimized evolution trajectory , one should have , first of all , exact solutions of evolution dynamics .",
    "such solutions have been found only recently in the case of a single - peak fitness landscape for the crow - kimura @xcite in @xcite and for the eigen model @xcite in @xcite . in [ 16 ]",
    "has been solved the evolution dynamics ( the manner of change of the mean number of mutations in population ) for the general symmetric fitness landscape case , derived using the hamilton - jacobi equation ( hje ) method @xcite .",
    "the optimization problem is highly complicated due to discontinuous effects in the dynamics of a mean number of mutations , as has been found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenon exists even in smooth fitness landscape . in fig .",
    "2 there is an example of such discontinuity .",
    "the overlap @xmath0 ( mean number of mutations is defined as @xmath1 , n being the genome length ) is first a smooth function of time , then its value jumps from the low branch of the @xmath2 like loop to the upper one , and again is a smooth function of time . as evolution equations are exactly mapped into hje equations , one can introduce hamiltonians and corresponding potentials . in @xcite",
    "has been suggested a receipt to identify a class of discontinuities : when the evolution potential has two local maximums .",
    "it has been observed also that the discontinuous dynamics could occur even for the case of a single maximum in evolution potential , when the fitness function is steep enough .",
    "the phenomenon is rather involved and in @xcite neither the `` enough steepness '' could be identified nor the position of sharp transitions for any case of discontinuities .",
    "we will give an analytical theory for some cases of discontinuous dynamics , and exact results for the optimization via mutation rate .",
    "we found discontinuities even in the quadratic fitness landscapes , missed in @xcite .",
    "consider the case of model with different forward and back mutation rates as in @xcite . for symmetric - fitness landscapes",
    "this model @xcite assumes that the relative probabilities @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( n being the genome length ) , obey @xmath5 \\nonumber\\\\ &   & + \\gamma_b \\left ( n - l+1 \\right ) p_{l-1 } + \\gamma_f \\left ( l+1 \\right ) p_{l+1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , and @xmath3 are relative probabilities at the hamming distance l ( l mutations ) ; @xmath7 is a fitness function ; and @xmath8 are the mutation rates . in eq.(1 ) , for @xmath9 and @xmath10 we omit @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "we solved eq.(2 ) for @xmath26 case in @xcite by a method of characteristics @xcite .",
    "for the characteristics line @xmath27 we have a hamilton equation @xmath28 . in our case eq.(2 ) gives : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is constant along the characteristics , like the energy of the particle in classical mechanics . at every point we have two characteristics , moving to the right and left .",
    "we consider the dynamics of the population in the crow - kimura model , originally having fixed overlap @xmath31 with the reference ( master ) sequence .",
    "let us look at the manner of change in the mean overlap of the population @xmath32 at the moment of time @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the fraction of the type @xmath35 in the population , @xmath36 is the number of mutations in the @xmath35-th type ( compared with the master sequence ) , and such mutant has a fitness @xmath37 . as time progresses the overlap distribution spreads out and so we focus on the time evolution of overlap @xmath0 that yields the maximum of this distribution .",

    "this upper bound determines the asymptotic value of the overlap with the reference sequence .",
    "of course , in the case @xmath48 the selective phase is lost and the dynamics drifts in the sequence space so that the asymptotic regime is characterized by a zero overlap with the reference sequence . to decide which equation to use we need to calculate @xmath49 @xmath50^{-1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a root of @xmath52 .",
    "this equation has a solution provided that @xmath53 , which in the case of monotonically increasing fitness implies @xmath54 .",
    "thus for a given @xmath31 and @xmath33 we calculate @xmath51 and then @xmath49 . if @xmath55 we use eq .",

    "( 8) , to obtain @xmath56 .      in @xcite there have been derived analytical formulas eqs.(5),(7 ) with @xmath57 .",
    "the @xcite failed to describe the discontinuities of @xmath58 analytically .",
    "the mean fitness is defined as a minimum of @xmath59 .",
    "when this function has two maxima at @xmath60 , there is a discontinuity in the dynamics , @xcite .",
    "the point is that there can be singularities in the dynamics , even for the fitness with a single maximum at @xmath61 , when the fitness is too steep .",
    "we performed a numerics for symmetric mutations ( @xmath26 ) to clarify the character of discontinuous dynamics , see fig.1-fig.3 . in the selective phase @xmath62",
    ", the potential @xmath59 has a single maximum at @xmath63 .",
    "nevertheless , sometimes the function @xmath64 has jumps .",
    "figure [ dyn:1 ] illustrates the time evolution of @xmath0 for @xmath65 . for not too small @xmath66",
    "the @xmath64 is a monotonic function , and the direct numerics of the system of equation for crow - kimura model supports well the theoretical formulas for @xmath64 .    for small values of @xmath66",
    "the s - shaped curves indicate the existence of a discontinuity in the position of the maximum of the overlap probability distribution .",
    "this threshold phenomenon was overlooked in a previous analysis of this problem which considered a single parameter setting , @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite .    the unusual time dependence of @xmath0 exhibited in fig .",
    "[ dyn:1 ] is quite counter - intuitive since it implies that for , say , @xmath69 there is an entire range of overlap values which are never reached by the evolutionary dynamics . to check that finding and to gather information on the stability of the solutions in the multi - solution regime , we present in fig .",
    "2 the results of the numerical solution of the ode system ( 1 ) for different values of sequence lengths .",
    "these results not only confirm the theoretical predictions but complement them by showing that the solution corresponding to the lower branch of the s - shape is the stable one .",
    "this information allows us to obtain the value @xmath70 at which the discontinuity takes place as well as the size of the discontinuity @xmath71 .",

    "we checked that it is valid in other cases with discontinuous dynamics as well , see fig .",
    "4 .      here",
    "we explore another important result exhibited in fig .",
    "[ dyn:1 ] , namely , that there is an optimal value of the scaled mutation rate @xmath66 that minimizes the evolutionary time to go from @xmath31 to @xmath74 . to assess this point in more detail , we note first the obvious fact that this evolutionary trajectory is possible only for @xmath75 . with this fact in mind",
    ", we can see from fig .",
    "[ dyn:1 ] that to reach the end point , say , @xmath76 it is a bad strategy to choose either small or large values of @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , there is an optimal value of the mutation rate , which for the parameter setting of this example ( @xmath65 and @xmath76 ) is @xmath77 .",
    "this interesting analytical finding substantiates the empirical strategy of fine tuning the mutation rate in genetic algorithms @xcite",
    ".    figure [ opt:1 ] neatly illustrates the existence of an optimal mutation rate for the fixed initial condition @xmath65 . to draw one of the curves in this figure we keep the end point @xmath0 fixed and measure the evolution time as a function of the scaled mutation rate . the existence of an optimal mutation rate that corresponds to the fastest evolutionary trajectory ( i.e. , minimum @xmath33 ) for the particular fitness choice , eq .",
    "( [ f_x_2 ] ) , is patent from this figure .    to find the exact location of the minima exhibited in fig.[opt:1 ] we put the condition @xmath78 , and get @xmath79 here @xmath80 must be set to a small ( but not too small ) value , typically @xmath81 .",
    "we also simply opted for the direct numerical derivation of the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ opt:1 ] .",
    "what is surprising is that the optimal mutation rate @xmath82 grows very steeply as @xmath0 departs from @xmath31 and quickly reaches a maximum value .",
    "looking carefully the eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we see an important issue .",

    "@xmath44 and @xmath42 are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ fs ] ) and ( [ def_x1 ] ) , respectively . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial overlap distribution has a peak at @xmath86 , which yields the maximum of the overlap distribution for @xmath87 where @xcite @xmath88^{1/2 } } .\\ ] ] note that @xmath89 for @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "we turn now to the case where the initial population is uniformly distributed among the @xmath93 configurations .",
    "figure [ dyn:5 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath0 for the flat initial distribution .",
    "the results are in stark contrast with those of the peaked initial distribution ( see fig .  [ dyn:1 ] ) : the odd s - shaped curves that produced the interesting dynamic behavior discussed before are absent in this case .",
    "in addition , the curves for different values of @xmath66 never cross which indicates that the fastest trajectory to reach any point @xmath0 is given by a vanishingly small mutation rate .",
    "let us calculate the optimal period to have a peak of population with the overlap @xmath0 at the moment of time @xmath33 .",
    "we should find the @xmath64 looking the maximum of the @xmath94",
    "although the selection of a fitness function that minimizes the evolution time between any two points @xmath31 and @xmath0 , which correspond to the maximum of the overlap distribution in two distinct times , is not as biologically significant as the selection of the optimal mutation rate , it has a considerable aesthetical appeal as the problem is somewhat akin to the brachistochrone problem of physics @xcite . in @xcite",
    "has been assumed that the fastest evolution dynamics between two sequences is given by a single peak fitness .",
    "the point is that one should accurately formulate the optimization task .",
    "the first possibility- we look the arrival of some fraction of population to the master peak .",
    "the second version : we look the arrival of a vast majority of population to the small ( the hamming distance is miserable compared with n ) neighborhood of the master sequence .",
    "the situation is highly non - trivial .",
    "if we took the first version with some small fraction , then the linear fitness could give better results than the single - peak fitness , see the fig .",
    "if we take the second version of optimization , then the single - peak fitness looks like as the fastest one . for the considered case ( from sequence to sequence ) we can just give the expression of the minimal time following to the results by @xcite .    for the symmetric mutation case the fastest relaxation gives the single - peak fitness landscape ( @xmath95 for the peak sequence and @xmath96 for the other sequences ) . in @xcite",
    "has been found the relaxation period to send the population from the given sequence ( at the hamming distance @xmath97 from the peak sequence ) to the peak one . to find the minimal time @xmath98 we just add the optimization condition via the choice of @xmath99 to the solution of @xcite : @xmath100\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\gamma}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we have done some numerics , see fig .",
    "7 , supporting the choice of single - peak fitness as an optimal fitness for the fastest relaxation , and @xmath98 by eq .",
    "( 17 ) as a minimal time period .",
    "consider now the fitness optimization problem in case of overlap distributions ( to send the population from the original overlap with @xmath101 to the eventual one with @xmath102 ) and symmetric fitness landscape .",
    "we are looking the optimization problem for the special fitness with @xmath103 eq.(8 ) gives @xmath104 , then eq . ( 7 ) is simplified : the first term disappears .",
    "for the fitness by eq.(18 ) we have @xmath105 it is easy to check that the minimal time is given by the fitness of eq.(18 ) .",
    "as @xmath106 the time given by eq.(19 ) is less than the time given by eq.(7 ) for any @xmath107 .",
    "consider the case of asymmetric mutations @xcite .",
    "we have original distribution at some @xmath31 , and our goal is to send the population to the overlap @xmath0 .",
    "now there is a single characteristic .",
    "therefore , contrary to the symmetric mutation case , all the properties are defined via the behavior of the fitness function in the considered interval @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "eqs.(4),(5 ) give the following equation @xmath108 we see that the optimization via mutation is trivial : raising the mutation rate we can send the population to the point @xmath0 immediately .",
    "the optimization via fitness is also trivial : the fastest trajectory is via the fitness @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we have done a numerics for quadratic fitness case , see fig .",
    "we see that the results again support the conjecture that the jumps are at the point with @xmath73 .",
    "we considered the problem of optimization in evolution in case of infinite population , symmetric fitness landscape and large genome length and found exact solutions .",
    "we found that the optimization ( optimal control , see @xcite ) is a highly non - trivial problem , as sharp , discontinuous transitions are typical for the evolution dynamics even with smooth fitness landscapes .",
    "we investigated these discontinuities and gave an analytical description of such sharp transitions for symmetric smooth landscape .",
    "we could succeed doing numerics for a larger values of n than those in @xcite .",
    "we found dynamical discontinuities even in case of directed mutations .",
    "the sharp transitions in evolution are important regarding the punctual evolution phenomenon ( see @xcite and the review @xcite ) .",
    "the optimization via mutation rate is most intriguing from the point of view of adaptive mutations .",
    "we calculated the minimal time to send the population from original sequence with small overlap ( with the master sequence ) and low fitness to the some final one ( with a higher fitness ) .",
    "the solution of the optimization problem is nontrivial , and there is some optimal mutation rate .",
    "it is interesting that the optimal rate of mutation to send the population from the overlap @xmath31 to @xmath0 is defined with the behavior of the fitness outside the interval @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "the numerics confirm our analytical results . on the contrary ,",
    "when we need to send the population from the high fitness configurations with the fixed original overlap to the final one with lower overlap , the mutation s optimization is a trivial task : just increase the mutation rate .",
    "similar is the situation in case of directed mutation : one can send the population in a fastest way just increasing the mutation rate .",
    "the optimization via fitness landscape ( to send the population from the original sequence to the final sequence ) should be carefully defined as a mathematical problem .",
    "when we are interested to send some small fraction of the population to the master sequence , the linear fitness can give better results than the single - peak one .",
    "when we are looking how to send the vast majority of population to the some infinitesimal neighborhood of the master sequence , then the optimum is given by a single - peak fitness landscape .",
    "such hypothesis has been assumed first in @xcite .",
    "we could not prove it rigorously , but we gave just an exact expression for this optimal time period , as well as performed numerics illustrating the optimization .",
    "if we are looking how to send the population with the initial overlap @xmath31 to the final overlap @xmath0 , then , as we proved rigorously , the minimal time is given by the single - peak like fitness eq .",
