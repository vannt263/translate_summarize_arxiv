    "it is nowadays well recognized that reliable nuclear physics inputs are essential for realistic simulations of many astrophysical phenomena . depending on the particular time scales and the resulting equilibrium conditions",
    ", this can be an equation of state ( eos ) and individual ( nuclear ) reactions , respectively . due to the relatively long timescale of reactions mediated by the weak interaction , the latter play an important role in many sites , for instance the late stages of massive star evolution @xcite , thermonuclear @xcite and core - collapse supernovae @xcite , nucleosynthesis and energy generation in x - ray bursts and other rp - process sites @xcite , the accreting neutron star crust  @xcite , and neutron star mergers  @xcite .",
    "within this paper , we will concentrate on core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "except for very low - density matter encountered in the outer layers , time scales are such that strong and electromagnetic interactions are in equilibrium .",
    "therefore , at any time , the composition of matter can be calculated as a function of the local temperature ( @xmath3 ) , baryon number density ( @xmath4 ) and proton fraction ( @xmath5 ) assuming nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . on the contrary ,",
    "weak interactions can in general not be considered in equilibrium and individual reactions rates are crucial to determine the local proton fraction .",
    "in particular , electron capture determines @xmath5 in the first stages of the collapse , the associated size of the homologous core , and has thus an impact on the consequent explosion dynamics @xcite .    for these simulations ,",
    "the time and space dependent electron capture rates are obtained for a given @xmath6 by folding the nse nuclear distribution with the capture rates on individual nuclei .",
    "the microphysics uncertainties on the rates thus originate both from the uncertainties on the nse distribution , and on those associated with the individual rates .",
    "a very complete study on the sensitivity of core collapse dynamics to variations of electron capture rates on medium - heavy nuclei has recently been performed  @xcite .",
    "the authors thereby concentrate on the latter aspect , modifying the rates on individual nuclei according to present uncertainties , using a comprehensive set of progenitors and eos .",
    "it was shown that important variations in the mass of the inner core at bounce and in the peak neutrino luminosity have to be expected .",
    "the variations induced by the modified electron capture rates are five times larger than those induced by the uncertainty on the progenitor model , showing the importance of an increased reliability of nuclear physics inputs . in this same work",
    "it was clearly shown that the results are most sensitive to the region around the @xmath0 shell closure for very neutron rich nuclei ( @xmath7 ) .    in this work",
    "we address the complementary aspect of uncertainties associated with the nuclear distribution .",
    "specifically , nuclear magicity , as incorporated in mass models within currently available eos , is known to be deeply modified in very neutron rich nuclei  @xcite and the pronounced shell closures at @xmath0 and @xmath8 are expected to be quenched far from stability .",
    "we study here the impact of such a possible quenching on the matter composition during collapse , and the associated modification of the electron capture rate .",
    "we show that modifications of the electron capture rate of up to 30% are possible in the case of strong shell quenching .    unlike  ref .",
    "@xcite , in this exploratory calculation we do not aim at computing the complete time evolution of @xmath5 , nor the associated modification of the inner core mass and the neutrino luminosity . such a complete simulation would require a consistent model for the mass and electron capture rates as determined by fermi and gamow - teller transition strengths for the relevant nuclei .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , from general arguments and the very detailed results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect that an increased capture rate leads to enhanced neutrino cooling , an accelerated collapse , and a higher inner core mass at bounce .",
    "the main message of the present work is to stress the need of structure information and mass measurements , particularly around the @xmath2ni region . from the theory viewpoint",
    ", it appears very important to have microscopic and consistent calculations of both masses and weak rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "as mentioned above , for given thermodynamic condition , i.e. given values of @xmath6 , the total electron capture rate is obtained by folding individual rates with the nuclear distribution .",
    "the latter is obtained by nse calculations which depend in turn on a number of inputs and in particular on the masses of different nuclei , thus on the mass model employed . in this section",

    "the model is based on a statistical distribution of compressible nuclear clusters composed by @xmath42 nucleons ( @xmath43 neutrons and @xmath44 protons ) immersed in a homogeneous background of self - interacting nucleons and electrons .",
    "the details of the model are explained elsewhere @xcite ; here we only recall the main physical ingredients which are important for the present study .",

    "the asymmetry @xmath59 differs from the cluster global asymmetry @xmath60 because of coulomb and skin effects , and is additionally modified to account for the influence of the external gas  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that , within these phenomenological limits , the choice of the interaction does not produce any sensible effect neither on the composition of matter during collapse nor on the average capture rates .",
    "this is due to the fact that , during the collapse trajectories we have considered , the density of the nucleonic gas and its neutron enrichment are not important enough to make unbound nucleon energetics play a significant role .",
    "this result is perfectly compatible with previous findings  @xcite .",

    "concerning the density of states , we use a back - shifted fermi gas model with parameters fitted from experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the key quantity of the model is thus the cluster binding energy , which we shall discuss in more detail in the following subsection .",
    "consistency with the equation of state of the free nucleons in principle demands that the cluster mass should be evaluated with the same energy functional employed for the gas .",
    "this is indeed done in the most recent nse models @xcite .",
    "however , no functional model sufficiently precisely reproduces nuclear ground states , and when experimentally measured nuclear masses are available , they are preferentially used in all recent nse models  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to stress at this point that , independent of the nuclear matter parameters of the eos ( symmetric nuclear matter incompressibility @xmath75 , symmetry energy per nucleon at the saturation density of symmetric matter @xmath76 , slope @xmath77 and curvature @xmath78 of symmetry energy at symmetric matter saturation density ) , no functional model gives completely reliable extrapolations of nuclear masses in the neutron - rich region where experimental masses are not available .",
    "this leads to a model dependence of the results , which is not related to any unknown nuclear matter parameter , but rather to the poor performance of the used hartree - fock or thomas - fermi approximations in the evaluation of nuclear masses , especially in the very neutron rich region .",
    "very few nuclear functional models exist , with parameters fitted with the same degree of accuracy on infinite nuclear matter and to properties of finite nuclei @xcite , and even in this case the behavior of nuclear mass towards the dripline is subject to great uncertainties .    anyway , since in the collapse applications the energetics of the gas plays a negligible role , the argument of consistency is not very important .",
    "for this reason we have chosen to employ , whenever experimental measurements are missing , the duflo - zuker mass model  @xcite which gives , within a microscopically inspired formalism , the present best reproduction of measured nuclear masses . for the unbound nucleon component the sly4 @xcite skyrme effective interaction is used .    since we are here mainly interested in the region around the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and in order to get an idea of the performance of the different mass models , fig .",

    "their extrapolation in the neutron rich region however increasingly deviate from each other approaching the dripline .",
    "in particular , a clear and strong slope change is visible at @xmath0 and @xmath1 for all elements including the lightest ones for the phenomenological models dz10 and frdm .",

    "our results show that the complete nuclear distribution should also be used in the calculation of the rates .",
    "if we replace the folding of the individual rates with the ec rate of the most probable nucleus weighted by the baryon number fraction bound in clusters , @xmath104 , the result ( lines with points ) is seen to very badly reproduce the complete folding result .",

    "the total rates are given by the sum of the different contributions , including electron capture on free protons ( dotted lines ) which however plays a minor role at all times .",
    "comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : thermocond ] , [ fig : azn ] and [ fig : ec ] , we note that for thermodynamic conditions where very neutron rich nuclei start to dominate , with masses which are not experimentally known , they still represent the major electron capture source .",
    "this qualitative picture is independent of the progenitor mass . from a more quantitative point of view , the relative importance of heavy clusters is higher for the lower mass progenitor , essentially because of the lower temperatures reached during the collapse .",
    "it is well known in the recent nuclear structure literature that even major shell closures can be quenched far from stability , see e.g.  @xcite . a very clear evidence exists for the @xmath107 magic number @xcite , which corresponds to a huge gap for decreasing proton number up to @xmath108si , and suddenly disappears in the next even - even isotope @xmath109 mg .",
    "this is partly due to the modification of single - particle energies far from stability , with the consequence that new magic numbers can appear corresponding to strongly deformed configurations .",
    "however the main reason of the modification of magicity relies on effects which go beyond the naive single particle shell model .",
    "first , the effect of the proton - neutron residual interaction in nuclei with strong asymmetry is decreased ; moreover , correlations play an increasing role which makes the very concept of shell closure less relevant . as a consequence ,",
    "the main effect is a quenching of the shell gap , even if secondary new gaps can appear in very localized regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "the possible modification of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 shell gaps far from stability is the object of intense theoretical and experimental research in nuclear structure ( e.g.  @xcite ) . here",
    ", we do not have the ambition to model this phenomenon , but simply analyze the modifications in the matter composition and associated electron capture rates , which would be induced by the expected shell quenching .",
    "a similar idea was proposed in ref .",

    "we follow a similar strategy as in ref .",

    "after neutron - rich nuclei start to be copiously populated shell quenching induces an increase of the ec rate .",
    "this is due to a significant abundance increase for non - magic nuclei and a moderate abundance decrease of the n=50 magic nuclei . in this regime shell quenching on the ec rates on heavy nuclei",

    "the amplitude of the effect depends on both quenching parameter @xmath126 and progenitor mass and may amount up to 30% .",

    "the overall modification of ec rates is opposite to that seen for heavy clusters .",
    "more precisely , shell quenching here points toward an increase of ec .",
    "this happens because of a more favorable production of light clusters .",
    "in this paper we have examined the consequence of a possible quenching of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 shell closures on the ec rates during core collapse . as basis of the analysis",
    ", we have considered the same typical thermodynamic conditions as in ref .",

    "@xcite . in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite we find that the properties of very exotic nuclei around these two shell closures is a key microscopic information to predict the evolution of the electron fraction during collapse .",
    "we have pointed out that a quenching of these shell closures compared with the popular dz10 mass model  @xcite considerably affects the nuclear distribution , and consequently the ec rates during collapse . using the standard l03 formalism for rates on individual nuclei ,",
    "we have analyzed the modification of nse average ec rates for different scenarios of shell quenching .",
    "depending on the progenitor mass and stiffness of shell quenching modifications of ec rates of up to 30% have been obtained .",
    "we expect that such effects , once consistently included in the time dependent evolution of the collapse , have a sizable effect on neutrino emissivity and on the enclosed mass at bounce .",
    "we should mention that the l03 approximation might be questionable in this exotic region far away from the stable @xmath11-shell nuclei where these formulae were adjusted .",
    "we expect , however , that more precise rates do not change our qualitative findings .",
    "the reason is that the ec rates are considerably suppressed for nuclei with a pronounced shell closure due to the energy gap in the single particle states which makes a transition more difficult .    in this work",
    "the quenching effect is governed by the parameter @xmath141 whose value is chosen in an arbitrary way .",
    "more sophisticated calculations in microscopic theories , such as modern interaction configuration shell model calculations in the relevant nuclear chart region  @xcite are currently underway , and will give essential information on the effective importance of the shell quenching .",
    "however , the last word will be clearly given by phenomenology .",
    "new precise mass measurements at the edges of the known isotopic table could allow for a much better extrapolation towards the neutron rich region in a very near future .    finally , it is important to stress that the modification of nuclear structure far from stability is expected to influence not only the nuclear mass , but also the individual ec probabilities , which should be consistently calculated together with the mass model and the energy functional describing the self - interaction of unbound particles .",
