    "let @xmath6 be a discrete - time simple random walk on the two - dimensional discrete torus @xmath1 .",
    "define the entrance time to the site @xmath7 by @xmath8 and the _ cover time _ of the torus by @xmath9 that is , @xmath0 is the first instant of time when all the sites of the torus were already visited by the walk .",
    "the analysis of cover time by the planar random walk was suggested in  @xcite under the picturesque name of `` white screen problem '' , and was soon after popularized in the probabilistic community ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  7 ) .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a substantial survey on cover times , and to  @xcite for a short account with a focus on exceptional points .",
    "besides being an appealing fundamental question , the study of cover time is of primer interest for performance evaluation of broadcast procedures in random networks , see e.g.  @xcite .    not only natural , the two - dimensional model is also more difficult than its higher - dimensional counterparts .",
    "this is because dimension two is critical for the walk , resulting in strong correlations . to illustrate the dimension - based comparison , observe that very fine results are available for @xmath10 , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein , and also  @xcite where a closely related continuous problem was studied .",
    "in contrast , in two dimensions the first - order asymptotics of the cover time was completed only recently , after a series of intermediate steps over a decade of efforts . in  @xcite it was proved that @xmath11 more rough results , without the precise constant , can be obtained using the matthews method  @xcite . the result",
    "was then refined in  @xcite ; in the same paper it was suggested that @xmath12 should be around  @xmath13 for a _ positive _ constant  @xmath14 ( observe that   means that @xmath15 ) .",
    "this can be seen as a step towards the conjecture of  @xcite that @xmath16 should be tight around its median and nondegenerate .",
    "such fine properties should be related to the fine structure of _ late points _ of the walk , i.e. , the sites that get covered only `` shortly '' before  @xmath0 . in spite of a very significant progress on this question achieved in  @xcite ,",
    "much remains to be discovered .",
    "now , we formulate our result on the deviations from below for the cover time :    [ t_lower ] assume that @xmath17 .",
    "then , for all @xmath18 we have @xmath19 \\leq \\exp\\big(-n^{2(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma})-{\\varepsilon}}\\big)\\ ] ] for all large enough  @xmath20 .",
    "it should be mentioned that in  @xcite it was proved that it is exponentially unlikely to cover _ any _ bounded degree graph in _ linear _ ( with respect to the number of vertices ) number of steps . in this paper , however , we are concerned with times which differ from the cover time only by a constant factor , and so we obtain only stretched exponential decay .",
    "[ rem_boxes ] in fact , in section  [ s_upbound ] we prove a bit more than the upper bound in  . namely , assume that @xmath3 , fix an arbitrary @xmath21 and tile the torus  @xmath22 with boxes of size  @xmath23 .",
    "then there exist @xmath24 , @xmath25 , such that , at the moment @xmath26 , there are at least  @xmath27 boxes which are not completely covered , with probability at least  @xmath28 .    for completeness",
    ", we also include the result on the deviations from the other side :    [ t_upper ] assume that @xmath29",
    ". then , for all @xmath18 we have @xmath30   \\leq n^{-2(\\gamma-1)+{\\varepsilon}}\\ ] ] for all large enough  @xmath20 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the proof of theorem  [ t_upper ] is not difficult once one has  , although , to the best of our knowledge , it did not appear in the literature explicitly in this form .    to see how the proof of theorem  [ t_upper ] can be obtained , observe first that we have for all @xmath31 , @xmath18 , all large enough @xmath20 and all @xmath32 , @xmath33   & \\leq n^{-\\beta+{\\varepsilon } } , \\label{eq_p_ht<}\\\\   \\min_{\\substack{y\\in { { \\mathbb z}}^2_n \\\\",

    "now , the second inequality in   immediately follows from   and the union bound . as for the first inequality",
    ", the strategy for achieving this lower bound can be described in the following way : let the random walk evolve freely almost up to the expected cover time so that , with good probability there are still uncovered sites , and then choose any particular uncovered site and make the walk avoid it till the end .",
    "more precisely , observe that , by  , for any fixed @xmath34 it holds that @xmath35 \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\ ] ] for all  @xmath20 large enough ; that is , at time @xmath36 there is at least one uncovered site with probability at least @xmath37 .",
    "an application of   with @xmath38 concludes the proof of theorem  [ t_upper ] .",
    "one can informally interpret   in the following way : hitting time of a fixed state has approximately exponential distribution with mean @xmath39 .",
    "first , the convergence in  ( [ conv_tn ] ) agrees with the intuitive understanding that `` hitting times of different sites should be roughly independent '' , since the maximum of  @xmath40 i.i.d .",
    "exponential random variables with mean @xmath39 is concentrated around @xmath41 . moreover , the probability for the maximum of such r.v.s to be larger by a factor @xmath42 than this value is @xmath43 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , while theorem  [ t_upper ] still agrees with this intuition , theorem  [ t_lower ] does not .",
    "indeed , the probability that the maximum of  @xmath40 i.i.d .   exponential random variables with mean",
    "@xmath39 is at most @xmath26 ( where @xmath3 ) is of order @xmath44 , which is not the actual order of magnitude obtained in theorem  [ t_lower ] .",
    "thus , the behavior of the lower tails of the cover time reveals the fine dependence between hitting times of the different points on the torus .    to prove the upper bound in  , we use the method of",
    "_ soft local times _ initially developed in  @xcite , where it was used to obtain strong decoupling inequalities for the traces left by random interlacements on disjoint sets .",
    "this approach allows to simulate an adapted process on a general space  @xmath45 using a realization of a poisson point process on  @xmath46 .",
    "naturally , one can use _ the same _ realization of the poisson process to simulate _",
    "different processes on  @xmath45 , thus giving rise to a coupling of these processes .",
    "we do this to compare the excursions of the random walk at different regions with the independent excursions , that is , in some sense , we _ decouple _ the traces of the random walk in different places , which of course makes things simpler .",
    "let us comment also on the large deviations for the cover time of the torus in dimension  @xmath10 .",
    "this question was studied in  @xcite in the continuous setting , i.e. , for the brownian motion . among other results , in  @xcite",
    "the many - dimensional counterparts of theorems  [ t_lower ] ( only the upper bound , by @xmath47 ) and   were obtained .",
    "we expect no substantial difficulties in obtaining the same results for the random walk using the same methods as in the present paper , except for the lower bound for the deviation probability from below , since the approach of section  [ s_lowbound ] fails in higher dimensions .",
    "notational convention : in the case when the starting point of the random walk is fixed , we indicate that in the subscript ; otherwise , the initial distribution of the random walk is considered to be uniform .",
    "the positive constants ( not depending on  @xmath20 but possibly depending on the quantities , such as  @xmath48 in theorem  [ t_lower ] , which are considered to be fixed ) are denoted by @xmath49 etc . also , it is convenient to view the random walks on the torus , simultaneously for all torus sizes  @xmath20 , as the random walk on the full lattice observed modulo  @xmath50 .",
    "in this section we describe the method of soft local times  @xcite , which is the key to the upper bound in  .",
    "first , we define the entrance time to a set @xmath51 by @xmath52    we write @xmath53 if  @xmath54 and  @xmath55 are neighbors in the graph  @xmath22 . for @xmath51",
    "let us define the ( inner ) boundary of  @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "next , for @xmath58 we define the entrance law to  @xmath56 : for @xmath59 and @xmath60 let @xmath61.\\ ] ]    let us now describe the method of soft local times , which allows us to compare excursions of the random walk with _",

    "let @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; and assume that @xmath70 , which implies also that @xmath71 .",
    "now , suppose that we are only interested in the trace left by the random walk on the set  @xmath56 .",
    "then , ( apart from the initial piece of the trajectory until hitting  @xmath72 for the first time ) it is enough to know what are the excursions of the random walk between the boundaries of  @xmath56 and  @xmath73 . to define these excursions ,",
    "consider the following sequence of stopping times : @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "we denote by @xmath77 the space of excursions between  @xmath78 and  @xmath79 ; i.e. , an element  @xmath80 of this space is a finite nearest - neighbor trajectory beginning at a site of  @xmath78 and ending on its first visit to  @xmath79 .",
    "denote also @xmath81 .",
    "the method of soft local times , as presented in  @xcite , provides a way of constructing the excursions between  @xmath82 and  @xmath72 of the walk  @xmath83 using a poisson point process on @xmath84 .",

    "one can _ simulate _ the sequence of excursions @xmath89 in the following way , see figure  [ f : excursions ] :    * consider a marked poisson point process of rate  @xmath90 ( with respect to ( counting measure on  @xmath82)@xmath91(lebesgue measure on  @xmath92 ) ) on  @xmath85 , with independent marks .",
    "* these marks are the excursions of the simple random walk starting at the corresponding site of  @xmath82 and stopped at the first visit to  @xmath72 . * at time  @xmath93 take @xmath94 such that there is exactly one point of the poisson process on the graph of @xmath95 and nothing below this graph , where @xmath96 . *",
    "the mark of this point is our first excursion  @xmath97 . * then , repeat the procedure , taking the graph of @xmath95 as `` @xmath98-level '' .",
    "formally , on each ray @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 ) take an independent poisson point process of rate  @xmath90 .",
    "together , these one - dimensional processes can be seen as a random radon measure @xmath101 on the space  @xmath85 , where  @xmath102 is a countable index set .",
    "the marks @xmath103 are independent excursions of the simple random walk , starting at  @xmath104 and stopped at the first visit to  @xmath72 .",

    "unique pair in @xmath108 with @xmath109 , and let  @xmath110 be the corresponding excursion .",

    "we can proceed iteratively to define @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 as follows @xmath116 and @xmath117 then define @xmath118 as the unique pair @xmath119 with @xmath120 , and let  @xmath121 be the corresponding excursion .",
    "then , one can show that @xmath122 are i.i.d.random variables , exponentially distributed with parameter  @xmath90 .",
    "also , it holds that the sequence of excursions @xmath123 equals in law to @xmath124 , and these are independent from @xmath125 .",
    "also , @xmath126 is distributed as  @xmath112 and independent of the above .",
    "the function  @xmath127 is called the soft local time of the ( excursion ) process , the reason for this name is explained in section  1.3 of  @xcite . according to the above definitions , the soft local time in  @xmath55 up to @xmath128th excursion",

    "similarly to the previous construction of the excursions of the random walk  @xmath83 , we can simulate the sequence @xmath136 of independent excursions in the same way , and its soft local time in  @xmath55 up to time  @xmath128 equals @xmath137 where @xmath138 is another sequence of exp(1 ) i.i.d .",
    "random variables . for the construction of this sequence of independent excursions ,",
    "we use _ the same realization _ of the marked poisson point process , thus creating a coupling of the sequence of the excursions of  @xmath83 with  @xmath139 collections of i.i.d .",
    "excursions ( see figure  [ f : independent_exc ] ) .",
    "at this point we have to observe that the sequence @xmath140 is _ not _ independent from the collection of sequences @xmath141 , although this fact does not result in any major complications .",

    "it should be observed that the analysis of the soft local times is considerably simpler in this paper than in  @xcite .",
