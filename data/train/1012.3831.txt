    "it is well known that the casimir effect  @xcite strongly depends on the dielectric function of the interacting surfaces  @xcite .",
    "transparent dielectrics , for example , attract less than highly reflective metals .",
    "dielectric materials , however , tend to accumulate isolated charges .",
    "those charges give rise to an electrostatic force that easily overcomes the casimir interaction .    in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "we have presented measurements of the casimir force between a gold coated sphere and a plate coated with either gold or an indium - tin - oxide ( ito , in@xmath0o@xmath1:sn ) layer .",
    "the experiment , which was performed in air , showed that ito is sufficiently conducting to prevent charge accumulation , but still transparent enough to halve the casimir attraction when compared to gold .",
    "the experiment was carried out by means of a quite complicated novel technique that , due to the limited space available , was not thoroughly explained in our previous work .",
    "we believe it is important to extend that work and provide the community with all the details of the experimental technique and data analysis , which is the purpose of this paper .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe the experimental setup and discuss general issues one has to tackle to perform casimir force measurements",
    ". then we discuss the experimental technique we developed to simultaneously calibrate the setup and measure the casimir force gradient , and derive in detail the specific forms of all our calibration and measurement signals .",
    "second , we illustrate a new method to determine the spring constant of our force sensor .",
    "third , we present experimental results on the general performance of our setup , namely the stability of the calibration procedure , the reproducibility of the force gradient measurements , and the spring constant determination .",
    "fourth , we present the casimir force measurements for the gold - gold and gold - ito interactions , and show measurements of the dielectric functions and surface topographies of our surfaces . finally we compare the hydrodynamic forces for the two sets of experiments .",
    "our experimental setup is designed to precisely measure surface forces between a 100  @xmath2 m radius sphere and planar samples at ambient pressure .",
    "the sphere is attached to a micromachined cantilever ( spring constant roughly 1  n / m ) whose deflection in response to external forces can be measured with pm sensitivity by a commercial atomic force microscope ( afm ) detection head ( veeco multimode ) ; the detection system is formed by a laser beam that reflects from the free end of the cantilever and hits a position sensitive photodetector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the sphere - cantilever assembly is coated with a ti adhesion layer and a 100  nm au film .",
    "the planar sample is mounted on a two - stage mechanical translator formed by a stick - slip piezoelectric motor ( attocube ) and a feedback controlled piezoelectric transducer ( physik instrumente ) to vary the separation between the sphere and plate surfaces .",
    "the stick - slip motor is used for coarse approach ( travel range 6 mm ) , while the feedback controlled transducer executes the fine distance scanning ( range 12  @xmath2 m , closed loop resolution 50  pm ) .",
    "both the detection head and the two - stage mechanical translator are anchored to a 10  @xmath3 al block that is actively temperature stabilized at 300  k to reduce mechanical drift from differential thermal expansion of the components .",
    "the al block is screwed onto an active anti - vibration table ( halcyonics ) , which is placed inside an anechoic chamber .",
    "this chamber lies onto a heavy marble optical table that is located in a temperature controlled laboratory .      in a casimir force measurement",
    ", there are three crucial issues that have to be dealt with .",
    "first , even if one would electrically connect both interacting surfaces , there exists an electrostatic potential difference @xmath4 due to the different work functions of the surfaces .",
    "since work functions of surfaces depend on quite a number of parameters , like crystal growth orientation and adsorbates , typically there even exists a potential difference between surfaces made out of the same material .",
    "this electrostatic potential difference gives rise to a force that is generally stronger than the casimir force . to avoid this problem ,",
    "most casimir force setups rely on a counterbias circuit that is used to apply @xmath5 to the surfaces in order to have no residual electrostatic force .",
    "second , even in setups where the distance between the sphere and the plate is varied with a feedback controlled piezoelectric transducer , one has only knowledge of the relative position changes and not of the absolute separation between the surfaces .",
    "it is thus mandatory to find the initial separation @xmath6 with a calibration procedure .",
    "because the distance dependence of the electrostatic force between a sphere and a plate is known exactly , most modern setups use this force to extract @xmath6 .",
    "third , the instrument has to be calibrated with a known force .",
    "again , one can use the electrostatic interaction to calibrate photodetector voltage versus force .",
    "we have developed a measurement scheme that solves all three issues at the same time .",
    "we present a measurement technique that makes use of simultaneous detection of both calibration signals ( based on the electrostatic force ) and the casimir force .",
    "the motivation for this approach is the benefit of absolute certainty that the calibration parameters always correspond to the measured forces because they are acquired simultaneously ; it is thus impossible to have inconsistent calibration and force data due to time - related drifts or other events . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "we have separated the calibration and casimir signals in frequency space : the signals are modulated at distinct frequencies that can be de - modulated individually with lock - in amplifiers .",
    "modulating an electrostatic interaction is extremely easy : one just has to apply a time - dependent potential difference to the sphere and the plate ( @xmath7 in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ]  b ) .",
    "we thus apply an oscillating voltage @xmath8 between the sphere and the plate , where @xmath9 is used to compensate for the contact potential difference @xmath4  @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", modulating the casimir force is a lot more challenging as its strength depends only on geometry and dielectric properties of the surfaces . on the other hand , of course",
    ", the strong distance dependence of the casimir force can be used to modulate its strength considerably .",
    "therefore , we chose to add a small modulation of the form @xmath10 to the piezoelectric transducer displacement @xmath11 , as previously introduced in @xcite .",
    "when the sphere and plate surfaces are separated by a distance @xmath12 , we have the following three forces acting on the sphere : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electrostatic force for externally applied potential difference @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the casimir force , and @xmath17 is the hydrodynamic force due to the moving air caused by the oscillatory motion of the plate .",
    "these forces induce a bending of the cantilever @xmath18 according to hooke s law , where @xmath19 is the spring constant of the cantilever .",
    "the output of the optical lever read - out @xmath20 is then changed by @xmath21 , where the sensitivity of the read - out is characterized by the calibration factor @xmath22 .",
    "we will now develop the full form of this signal @xmath23 .",
    "following elementary electrostatic arguments , one can show that the electrostatic force between a plane and a sphere of radius @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the permittivity of vacuum , @xmath15 is the externally applied voltage , @xmath27 is the contact potential difference between the two surfaces , and @xmath28 ( i.  e.  within the _ proximity force approximation _ ( pfa )  @xcite ) . to evaluate the total signal @xmath23",
    ", we substitute @xmath29 and incorporate the distance modulation @xmath10 .",
    "we then approximate the photodetector signal with a first order taylor expansion for small excursion @xmath10 around @xmath30 ( see fig .",

    "@xmath43 will thus be neglected in the rest of the paper .",
    "[ stimeseries ] is only valid if the force sensor can follow the modulations of the force without picking up phase delays .",
    "it is thus convenient to operate in the quasi - static regime , which also ensures that the amplitude response of our cantilever at the various measurement frequencies does not vary . for these reasons",
    ", we set @xmath48  hz and @xmath49  hz , which are both much lower than the resonance frequency of the force sensor ( 1.9  khz , quality factor @xmath50 in air ) .",
    "furthermore , we have not included the elastic component of the hydrodynamic interaction in @xmath46 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the compression effect is small as long as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the viscosity of air and @xmath53 is the air pressure . in our experiment , @xmath54 , so the elastic component can be neglected and we only have to consider the dissipative part of @xmath55 .",
    "since a dissipative effect depends on velocity @xmath56 , it will manifest itself as a cantilever oscillation at @xmath57 with a corresponding detector signal @xmath47 that is 90  degrees rotated with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "the first task of the electrostatic calibration procedure is to compensate for the presence of the contact potential difference @xmath27 between the two interacting surfaces . since @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath58 ( see eq .  [ somega1 ] ) , we can create a negative feedback loop in which a lock - in amplifier at @xmath59 generates @xmath9 in such a way that @xmath44 vanishes , i.e.  @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the stability of this feedback loop is guaranteed by a single large time constant . in the current experiment ,",
    "the systematic error in the compensation voltage is negligible ( @xmath61v ) , and the statistical error is @xmath62  mv .",
    "this feedback scheme is similar to kelvin probe force microscopy @xcite , and allows one to measure @xmath27 at all sphere - plane separations .",
    "even more , the automatic compensation of @xmath27 leads to the zeroing of the @xmath63 terms in eqs .",

    "we define    @xmath66    according to eq .",
    "[ s2omega1 ] , @xmath67 can be experimentally obtained from @xmath68 . in this way",
    ", we have essentially performed an ac measurement of the curvature of the electrostatic parabola , instead of using multiple dc measurements with different applied voltages  @xcite .",
    "we measure @xmath67 as a function of @xmath11 by varying the extension of the capacitive feedback controlled piezoelectric transducer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]c ) in discrete steps .",
    "we then fit eq .",
    "[ alphadefinition ] to these @xmath67 data .",
    "this procedure allows us to calibrate the separation at the start of the measurement @xmath69 and the force sensitivity @xmath70 for each measurement run .",
    "we then use the estimate of @xmath69 to adjust the initial value of @xmath11 of the next measurement run in order to have all runs start at the same separation . to avoid large electrostatic forces at small separations ,",
    "we reduce @xmath7 as the surfaces approach such that @xmath45 stays nearly constant at a value that corresponds to a root - mean - square electrostatic force of @xmath71  pn  @xcite .",
    "we use a third lock - in amplifier ( the measurement lock - in in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ]  b ) , locked at @xmath57 , to measure the casimir force .",
    "the phase of this lock - in amplifier is aligned to the actual motion of the plate by examining the signal from a dedicated fiber optic interferometer ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the same interferometer is used to calibrate the amplitude @xmath72 of the separation modulation .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "[ somega2 ] that the in - phase component @xmath46 contains both an electrostatic contribution and the gradient of the casimir force @xmath73 at the current separation .",
    "since @xmath74 by the @xmath27 feedback circuit , eq .",
    "[ somega2 ] simplifies to    @xmath75    combining eqs .",
    "[ s2omega1 ] and  [ somega2simplified ] , one obtains    @xmath76    since the absolute separations @xmath38 and @xmath65 are known from the simultaneous electrostatic calibration ( and @xmath72 is calibrated too ) , one can calculate the value of the first term of eq .",
    "[ somega2final ] . using the force sensitivity @xmath77 obtained from the calibration",
    ", we can finally get the casimir force gradient : @xmath78 it is interesting to note that we obtain the casimir force gradient divided by the sphere radius @xmath24 , because we have calibrated the instrument with the electrostatic force which scales linearly in @xmath24 ( see eq .  [ elecforce ] ) .",
    "however , within the pfa , the gradient of the force between a sphere and a plate relates directly to the pressure between two parallel plates @xmath79 as long as @xmath28 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 can be calculated with the lifshitz theory  @xcite and depends only on the dielectric properties of the interacting surfaces .",
    "therefore , we can directly compare our @xmath82 data to theory , without any need to know the precise radius of the sphere .",
    "furthermore , by using a quadrature lock - in amplifier at @xmath83 , we can obtain @xmath47 together with @xmath46 .",
    "we can thus measure the hydrodynamic interaction between the sphere and the plate simultaneously with , but independently from , the casimir force gradient .",
    "so far , we have neglected the bending of the cantilever in the assessment of the distance between the sphere and plate surfaces .",
    "this is valid as long as the forces are relatively weak and the spring constant of the cantilever is relatively high .",
    "of course , the nominal spring constant of the cantilever is supplied by the manufacturer , but the addition of a glued sphere and metal coating influence the stiffness .",
    "therefore , we have developed a technique to measure the spring constant with the electrostatic force .",
    "furthermore , this method also allows us to extract the deflection sensitivity @xmath22 of the optical lever readout ; we can then convert photodetector signal @xmath23 into cantilever deflection @xmath18 .",
    "this technique might be useful for afm force measurements in general .    to obtain the cantilever spring constant and the deflection sensitivity",
    ", we apply a relatively large @xmath7 between the sphere and the plate .",
    "exactly like described above in the electrostatic calibration section , we keep the electrostatic force at @xmath84 constant , but now at roughly 2  nn rms instead of 50  pn rms , by reducing @xmath7 while increasing the piezoelectric transducer extension @xmath11 in discrete steps .",
    "this strong force will reduce the sphere plate distance , and we therefore have to solve the following implicit equation for the electrostatic force    @xmath85    where , since we have already dealt with the contact potential difference @xmath4 with the feedback circuit , @xmath15 just refers to the ac component of the applied voltage .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we have omitted the piezo modulation at @xmath83 from this derivation , as it does not affect the results .",

    "furthermore , we obtain the hydrodynamic forces for both measurement sets and compare the results .",

    "it is interesting to observe that this 2  nm modulation of the separation @xmath12 at @xmath84 gives rise to a measurable signal at @xmath119 even at 1  @xmath2 m distance .",
    "furthermore , if we use the approximately known sphere radius of 100  @xmath2 m , we obtain the spring constant of our cantilever @xmath127  n / m . as the nominal spring constant before sphere attachment and gold coating was 0.9  n / m ,",
    "the value we find with this electrostatic method is very reasonable .    with the deflection sensitivity calibrated",
    ", we can now assess the total cantilever bending and the precision in the measurements of the cantilever deflection .",
    "in the measurement runs presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : eleccalibration ] , [ fig : eleccalibration2 ] and [ fig : forceresults ] , we used an @xmath95 set point of 4  mv rms , which corresponds to a cantilever motion of 52  pm rms . therefore , the static bending of the cantilever due to the electrostatic calibration procedure is 74  pm ( see eqs .",
    "[ s0 ] and  [ s2omega1 ] ) . anyway , this static bending is constant during the measurement run and it is thus automatically taken into account in the estimate of @xmath6 .",
    "the cantilever oscillations at @xmath83 caused by the total force gradient and the hydrodynamic interaction are @xmath128  pm rms for these measurement runs , which means that the corresponding static bending is @xmath129  pm .",
    "it is thus evident that we can safely neglect the static bending of the cantilever in our data analysis .",
    "since the noise in @xmath95 is 30  @xmath2v  rms , the precision in the detection of the cantilever deflection is 400  fm  rms with our 1  s rc time ( 24  db low - pass filter ) .",
    "this means that our setup has an rms sensitivity of 1  pm/@xmath130 at @xmath131  hz .",
    "we now present a comparison between two experiments performed with the same gold coated 100  @xmath2 m radius sphere and two different plates .",
    "the first experiment is conducted with a polished sapphire substrate coated with a gold film similar to the one deposited on the sphere .",
    "the general performance of our setup was discussed above by analyzing this first experiment .",
    "the second experiment consists of 580  measurement runs in which the plate is replaced by a float glass substrate with a sputtered ito thin film on top ( pgo cec010s , typically @xmath132 , or , equivalently , @xmath133 cm ) .",
    "after purchase , this sample has been exposed to air for more than two years before our measurements were performed .",
    "[ fig : ito ] shows the casimir force gradient between the two pairs of surfaces ( au - au in green triangles , au - ito in red squares )  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ito ]  a , we plot the force gradients as a function of separation on a double logarithmic scale for randomly chosen subsets of the data ( 150 out of 580 for both cases ) .",
    "both datasets are obtained with the exact same settings for the electrostatic calibration and the force gradient measurement , and the casimir force gradient is obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq:1overrdfdd ] .",
    "the black lines indicate the theoretical force gradient , as will be explained below .",
    "[ fig : ito ]  b and  c present two histograms of all 580  casimir force gradient measurements for both au - au and au - ito at separations @xmath134  nm and @xmath135  nm , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the interaction strength with the ito sample is considerably reduced with respect to the gold plate .",
    "note that our estimate of @xmath69 , and thus @xmath12 , relies on the simple form of eq .",
    "[ elecforce ] and is only valid for @xmath28 ( pfa ) .",
    "this assumption is not entirely correct in the probed separation range @xcite and results in a systematic error in @xmath69 of about @xmath136  nm . still , the corresponding underestimate of the separation is equal for both the measurements with au and ito , and can thus be neglected in the comparison of the two experiments .",
    "concerning the compensation voltage , we observed that @xmath27 varies approximately @xmath137  mv and @xmath138  mv over the complete measurement range in the au - au and au - ito cases , respectively .",
    "these slight variations of @xmath27 do not compromise the measurement of the casimir force at the current level of sensitivity .",
    "the value of @xmath27 drifts in time from @xmath139 to @xmath140  mv for au - au and from 72 to 50  mv for au - ito at @xmath141  nm .",
    "it is also important to note that , during the whole duration of the experiment , we never observed any problem with electrostatic charging of the au or ito layers , which would have most likely resulted in erratic behavior of @xmath67 and/or @xmath27 .    in order to compare the obtained casimir force gradients with theoretical predictions , we have investigated the dielectric properties of our surfaces . in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalproperties ] , we show the reflection and transmission spectra of the two plates , measured from the thin film side , in the frequency range from 0.5 to 6.5  ev .",
    "the black continuous lines represent the reflection and transmission spectra calculated from the literature . for au , we used the values reported in @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the dielectric function of ito is constructed from a sum of drude and tauc - lorentz models with the parameters from @xcite .",
    "the real part of the dielectric function is calculated with direct kramers - kronig integration .",
    "the thickness of the ito thin film is fitted by examining the interference fringes in the reflection and transmission spectra ( taking into account the refractive index of the material ) and turned out to be 190  nm , which is close to the typical thickness reported by the manufacturer ( 180  nm ) .",
    "the agreement between the spectroscopic measurements and these literature values is reasonable in the probed energy range .",
    "we want to stress that for au there are no adjustable parameters whatsoever in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalproperties ] , and that for ito only the thickness was fitted .",
    "these results allow us to estimate the casimir force expected in the two cases ( au and ito ) and compare the calculation with our measurements ( see eq .",
    "[ eqpfa ] ) .",
    "the theoretical casimir interaction is calculated with the lifshitz equation using the dielectric properties of our surfaces . for au ,",
    "we have extrapolated the data of  @xcite with a drude model ( @xmath142  ev and @xmath143  ev from  @xcite ) . for ito",
    ", we used the model from @xcite for all frequencies .",
    "the computed force gradient is plotted as the black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ito ] .",
    "the agreement between data and theory is reasonable , although we do seem to obtain different powers for data and theory . at small separation",
    ", the experimental curves are bending upwards , which is a sign of surface roughness effects  @xcite ; the theoretical curves were calculated for perfectly smooth surfaces .",
    "furthermore , the au - au data tend to give rise to a stronger force at large distance compared to theory , which is most likely caused by an artifact common to many afm force measurements : the laser light is reflected from the planar sample into the photodetector giving rise to a background signal . in the casimir force gradient method presented here , this artifact results , in first order , to an offset in the data ; this explains the upwards trend of the data for large @xmath12 .",
    "although the precise distance dependence and strength of this artifact is unknown , we estimate from the force gradient data at large separation ( @xmath144  nm ) that the associated systematic error is certainly @xmath145  n / m@xmath111 . in the case of the au - ito measurements ,",
    "such a background signal is a lot smaller because ito does not reflect well the laser light ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalproperties ] at @xmath146  ev ) . to explain the mismatch , it is therefore more likely that the model we used for the dielectric properties  @xcite is too metallic at low energy and that , consequently , the calculated casimir interaction is too strong especially at large @xmath12 .",
    "so far , we have neglected the effects of surface roughness in our analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : roughness ] , we show topology measurement of our surfaces . figs .  [",
    "fig : roughness ]  a and  b are afm tapping - mode scans ( 10 by 10  @xmath2 m ) of the au on polished sapphire and ito on float glass samples , respectively .",
    "the gold sample has an rms surface roughness of 0.8  nm , while the ito coated plate has a roughness of 4  nm rms .",
    "[ fig : roughness ]  c presents a height profile of the surface of the sphere bottom obtained with an optical profiler .",
    "since the cantilever is mounted at a 15 degrees angle with respect to the planar sample surface ( this is typical in afm design ) , the top of this profile does not correspond to the area of closest approach in a force measurement .",
    "however , this height profile does give us the ability to estimate the surface roughness of the sphere , resulting in a value of 3.8  nm rms .",
    "since we used the same sphere in both sets of measurements , the surface roughness of the sphere can never cause the observed difference in casimir force gradients between the au - au and au - ito cases .",
    "furthermore , we recall that surface roughness tends to enhance the strength of the casimir interaction  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore impossible that the different surface roughnesses of the two planar samples is responsible for the difference reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : ito ] , because the ito sample is considerably rougher than the gold coated sapphire substrate .",
    "when we discussed the experimental details of our experiment , we mentioned the interesting feature that we can measure both the casimir force gradient and the hydrodynamic force acting on the sphere with the same lock - in amplifier at @xmath83 .",
    "[ fig : hydroresults ] shows the hydrodynamic force for both the au - au interaction ( green triangles ) and for the au - ito case ( red squares ) .",
    "we have plotted the rms force resulting from the 2.72  nm rms oscillation of the plate at @xmath147  hz .",
    "both curves appear to change exponent at a separation of around 200  nm .",
    "this bending is caused by the slip of the air flow across the surfaces , i.  e.  the fluid velocity at the gas - solid interface is nonzero .",
    "this phenomenon is treated in  @xcite and the expressions derived in there describe our data satisfactorily . concerning the comparison of the two sets of hydrodynamic data ,",
    "it is clear that the hydrodynamic forces are very similar in the au - au and au - ito experiments .",
    "still , there exists a small difference between the two curves of roughly 2% .",
    "this difference can not be caused by an error in the determination of the initial separation @xmath6 , because both data sets are parallel on the double logarithmic plot .",
    "we suppose that the cause may lie in the different surface roughnesses of the au and ito samples that lead to different amounts of fluid slip over the sample surfaces .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare our method for the detection of hydrodynamic forces with recent measurements obtained with afm s  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the cantilever with sphere is driven at its free resonance and the amplitude and phase of the cantilever motion are used to extract the hydrodynamic force . in  @xcite",
    ", two methods were employed to measure the hydrodynamic interaction between a colloid sphere and a plate : measuring the static deflection of the cantilever during a fast approach of the planar sample and analyzing the thermal noise of the cantilever while slowly approaching the plate towards the sphere . in both papers , however , the separation between the two interacting surfaces was determined by bringing the sphere and plate into contact , a method that is prone to inaccuracies due to surfaces asperities ( this is also reported in  @xcite ) .",
    "since our method employs both a hydrodynamic force measurement and a precise calibration of the distance at the same time , we have developed a more reliable technique for hydrodynamic force measurements .",
    "we have presented the experimental details of our casimir force measurements between gold and ito surfaces  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the mechanical drift of our setup is less than 0.1  nm per measurement run and that our electrostatic calibration is performed with 0.2% precision .",
