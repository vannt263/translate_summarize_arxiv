    "in recent years graphene@xcite has become one of the most attractive materials due to its unique properties such as high - mobility electron transport @xcite , the presence of room - temperature quantum hall effect@xcite , the strong lattice structure@xcite and the extremely high in - plane thermal conductivity.@xcite however , its highly active surface and the lack of a band gap in the electronic structure are emerging drawbacks for graphene .",
    "recently , interests have now also focused on other two - dimensional systems having honeycomb structures , such as graphane@xcite , halogenated graphenes@xcite , silicene@xcite , iii - v binary compounds@xcite , and transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds)@xcite .",
    "recent studies have revealed that among various monolayer structures especially tmds are quite promising materials for electronics and optoelectronics applications .",
    "bulk tmds have a number of exceptional properties such as superconductivity of tas@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , mott transition in 1t - tas@xmath0 and the presence of charge density wave in tise@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite it was also reported that the electrical and optical properties of tmds are dramatically altered with the number of layers@xcite .",
    "although bulk hexagonal tmds possess an indirect band gap , mono - layer tmds exhibit a direct band gap which is crucial for optoelectronic devices , sensors and catalysts .",
    "in addition , n - type and p - type field - effect - transistors ( fets ) based on monolayer and multilayer tmds have been investigated.@xcite it was also reported that many monolayer 2d crystals are reactive and segregation may occur easily.@xcite therefore , the investigation of bilayer structures which are chemically more stable than monolayer structures is of vital significance .",
    "recent studies have shown that synthesis of heterostructures made of combinations of different tmd single layers , graphene , fluorographene and hexagonal - bn ( hbn ) is experimentally achievable.@xcite since tmds and other two - dimensional structures have a lot of diverse monolayer structures , when they are combined together they are expected to exhibit very different properties .",
    "@xcite    since the intercalation and migration of foreign atoms is inevitable during the formation of such lamellar materials and heterostructures , the investigation of the diffusion characteristics of various impurities is essential .",
    "early studies revealed that alkali - metal doping of bulk tise@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 can be utilized as an efficient way to tune the fermi level.@xcite the electrical conductivity of mos@xmath0 can be altered by substitutional doping.@xcite furthermore , decoration of the surfaces of few layer tmds by metal nanoparticles like au , ag and pt may provide p- and n - type doping.@xcite the metal - atom adsorbed tmds find their application in various areas including energy storage@xcite , photonics@xcite , biosensing@xcite , and catalysis.@xcite in a recent study , it has been demonstrated that , the presence of various impurities at the interface between mos@xmath0/graphene / hbn and ws@xmath0/graphene / hbn heterostructures may modify the mobility of charge carriers.@xcite it was also reported that contamination and migration of various molecules are inevitable during the formation of graphene based heterostructures and trapped hydrocarbons segregate into isolated pockets , leaving the rest of the interface atomically clean .",
    "@xcite in addition , it was found that , attached metal nanoparticles on tmds / graphene stacks can be suitable for enhanced optoelectronic properties.@xcite    despite some recent studies on adatom adsorption on various tmds , intercalation and migration of foreign atoms in heterostructures have not been investigated . in this study , using density functional theory based electronic structure method , we investigate the diffusion characteristics of heavy metal atoms ( au and ag ) on monolayers and intercalated in such bilayer heterostructures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we give details of our computational methodology . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the energetics of the metal atoms ag and au on monolayers of graphene and tmds are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] diffusion characteristics of those metal atoms inside bilayer heterostructures are shown and in sec . [ sec5 ] we summarize and conclude our results .",
    "to determine ground state atomic structures and migration characteristics of monolayers and their bilayer heterostructures , first - principles calculations were performed using density functional theory ( dft ) with a plane - wave basis set as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp).@xcite for the exchange correlation function generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite was used together with the van der waals correction.@xcite spin - unpolarized calculations were carried out using projector - augmented - wave potentials ( paw ) . the plane - wave basis set with kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev was used .    a 4@xmath14 and 3@xmath13 hexagonal supercells of single layer and bilayer structures are employed to model diffusion paths of metal atoms , respectively .",
    "the k - point samples were 3@xmath13@xmath11 for these supercells .",
    "it is calculated that a 12   of vacuum space is enough to hinder long - range dispersion forces between two adjacent images in the supercell .",
    "lattice constants and total energies were computed with the conjugate gradient method , where atomic forces and total energies were minimized .",
    "the convergence criterion of our calculations for ionic relaxations is @xmath2 ev between two consecutive steps .",
    "the maximum hellmann - feynman forces acting on each atom were reduced to a value of less than @xmath3 ev /  .",
    "all components of the external pressure in the unit cell was held below 1 kbar . for the electronic density of states",
    "gaussian smearing was used with a broadening of 0.1 ev .",
    "the non - local correlation energies were determined by employing density functional theory plus the long - range dispersion correction ( dft+d2 ) method.@xcite the values of 24.670 , 5.570 , 12.640 , 1.750 , 24.670 , 40.620 , and 40.620 are used as the c@xmath4 coefficient of mo , s , se , c , ag , au , and w atoms , respectively . on the other hand , values of 1.639 , 1.683 , 1.771 , 1.452 , 1.639 , 1.772 , and 1.772 are used for the vdw radius of mo , s , se , c , ag , au , and w atoms , respectively .",
    "these c@xmath4 coefficients and vdw radii were determined from previous studies .",
    "@xcite it is essential that long - range dispersion correction to the interlayer force is taken into account in order to obtain reliable layer - layer distances and electronic properties of the heterobilayers .    to study the adsorption and diffusion of metal atoms in these systems , total energies of monolayer tmds ( graphene ) with adatom were calculated for 19 ( 12 ) different points which include the high symmetry points ( h , m , b , and t ) .",
    "total energies of bilayers with adatom were calculated for only 4 high symmetry points . in these different points ,",
    "the adatom - surface distance was fully relaxed while the position of the adatoms parallel to the surface was kept fixed . to obtain accurate diffusion characteristics of heavy atoms on monolayer tmds and graphene ,",
    "calculations were performed using 4x4 supercells . in these calculations , first and second nearest neighbors of the adatom were fully relaxed while all the rest was kept fixed .",
    "on the other hand , in the bilayer calculations , all atoms of bilayers were free to move in all directions .",
    "binding energies were calculated for the most favorable adsorption sites .",
    "these binding energies were calculated from the expression @xmath5 , where e@xmath6 is the binding energy of the metal atoms on the tmds or graphene , e@xmath7 is the energy of monolayer tmds or graphene , e@xmath8 is the energy of metal atoms , e@xmath9 is the total energy of the metal atom - monolayer system .",
    "we have chosen the following convention to define the diffusion energy barrier .",
    "the binding energy of an adatom was calculated at all high - symmetry points of the tmds and the graphene surface .",
    "since adatoms follow the lowest energy path , the difference of the energies between the most favorable site and the second most favorable site was considered as the diffusion energy barrier .    in order to obtain the correct value of the charge transferred between the metal atoms , the tmds and the graphene , bader charge analysis was performed . rather than electronic orbitals in bader methodology , charge partitioning",
    "is based on electronic charge density and therefore it is highly efficient , it scales linearly with the number of grid points , and is more robust than other partitioning schemes.@xcite",
    "so far , experiments have revealed that similar to graphene many of the tmds ( mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 , res@xmath0 ) have a lamellar crystal structure where the layers are held together by weak van der waals forces , while intra - layer metal - chalcogen bonds have strong covalent character . due to the weakly ( vdw )",
    "bonded layered structure of graphene and tmds either diffusion of foreign atoms on their surface or easy intercalation into the layers may take place .",
    "moreover , these foreign atoms may provide new functionalities to the tmds and to the heterostructures made of various layered materials .",
    "therefore , understanding how foreign atoms adsorb , migrate and intercalate are of highly importance .",
    "first we calculate the binding and migration of ag and au atoms on the surface of monolayer tmds and graphene .",
    "for a hexagonal primitive unitcell of mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and graphene the lattice parameters are calculated to be 3.190 , 3.316 , 3.179 and 2.468  , respectively . for calculations of adsorption and migration of metal atoms",
    "4@xmath14 supercells were used in order to limit au - au ( and ag - ag ) interaction between adjacent cells . as shown in fig .",
    "[ structures ] for a metal atom adsorbed on tmds and graphene , there are four possible adsorption sites : top of carbon or chalcogen atom ( t ) , bridge site on c - c or m - x bond ( b ) , on top of the center of hollow site ( h ) and on top of metal atom mo or w ( m )",
    ".    diffusion and mobility of impurities on a two - dimensional crystal surface can be described by quantities such as activation energy ( @xmath10 ) and jump probability ( @xmath11 ) from the binding site over the lowest - barrier path at room temperature .",
    "the @xmath11 value is a measure of the possibility of propagation by overcoming the energy barrier among the possible adsorption sites .",
    "jump probability from one lattice site to another one can be calculated by using the formula @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and it increases exponentially with increasing temperature . here",
    "@xmath10 is the activation energy which is equal to the difference of the energy of the two lowest energy states .    our calculated adsorption sites , binding energies , vertical adsorption position , charge transfer , energy barrier and jump probability ( @xmath11 ) values are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we see that the bonding of an ag atom to graphene occurs at the b site and the h site is the least favorable adsorption site . in accordance with the previous dft study , we found that the binding energy of au on graphene is almost twice the binding energy of ag on graphene .",
    "the ag atoms lose ( while the au atoms gain ) a small amount of charge when they bind to the graphene surface.@xcite on the surface of tmds , the most favorable bonding site for ag atoms is the h site and the next largest adsorption energy is found for the m site .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that metal atoms diffuse through these two favorable adsorption sites .",
    "therefore the energy difference between these two lowest - energy sites can be regarded as the diffusion barrier .",
    "since the energy barrier for ag between h and m sites is high ( @xmath1450 mev ) diffusion through these symmetry points may not occur at low temperatures .",
    "it appears from fig .",
    "[ ag - hesap ] that ag atoms on graphene migrate through the b and t sites with almost zero ( @xmath142 mev ) energy barrier , while migration on tmds ( mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 ) occurs through h and m sites .",
    "as shown in table [ table1 ] , room temperature @xmath11 values of ag atoms are 0.129 , 0.182 , 0.072 and 0.926 for mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and graphene , respectively .",
    "thus diffusion of the ag atoms on graphene occurs much more easily than on tmds .",
    "binding energy of a single au atom on graphene and tmds is found to be @xmath14300 mev larger than that of ag .",
    "interestingly , on mose@xmath0 , au atoms prefer bonding on the h site like ag atoms , while the top of a sulfur atom ( t site ) is the most preferable site on mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 layers .",
    "the distinctive behavior of the au atoms can be explained by the distinctive characteristic of the s - au bond . although the chemical properties of chalcogen atoms s and se are quite similar , as shown by yee et al.@xcite , the strength of the s - au bond is slightly weaker than the se - au bond .",
    "our calculations reveal that the binding energy of an au atom on mose@xmath0 surface is higher than the binding energy of an au atom on mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 surfaces .",
    "interestingly , strong au - s bonds require bonding on t site while the au - se bond results in h - site adsorption . as shown in fig.[au - hesap ] , as in the ag adsorption case , mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 surfaces have almost identical characteristics for au adsorption at all high symmetry points .",
    "in addition , the migration barrier seen by au atoms is @xmath1430 mev larger than the energy barrier of ag atoms on graphene . therefore , compared to ag on graphene ,",
    "the smaller jump probability of au atoms on graphene implies relatively slow and smaller nucleation of au clusters on graphene which agrees with experimental results.@xcite    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      next we investigate the diffusion and energy barriers which are seen by ag and au atoms sandwiched in between single layers of tmds .",
    "there are two possible stacking types for bilayer tmds ; aa and ab stacking . in the aa",
    "stacking , the chalcogen atom ( s or se ) in one layer is on top of the chalcogen atom ( s or se ) of the other layer . on the other hand , in ab stacking , chalcogen atom ( s or se ) in one layer",
    "is on top of the metal atoms ( mo or w ) of the other layer .",
    "our calculations show that for the considered bilayer heterostructures of tmds , the ab stacking is the ground state geometry .    _",
    "mos@xmath15/mos@xmath15 bilayers : _ the lattice parameter of ab - stacked bilayer mos@xmath15/mos@xmath15 structure was found to be almost the same as of monolayer mos@xmath15 .",
    "it is seen that the ag - mos@xmath15 distance decreases due to the presence of the upper mos@xmath15 layer .",
    "the layer - layer distance of bilayer mos@xmath0 increases from 3.08 to 3.70 upon single ag intercalation . on the other hand ,",
    "single au atom causes a larger layer separation ( from 3.08 to 4.12  ) than ag atoms .",
    "our calculations revealed that the most preferable site of the ag atom remains the h - site , even after the addition of the second layer .",
    "our charge analysis showed that metal atoms tend to donate a larger amount of charge when they are intercalated in bilayers .",
    "the amount of charge transfer becomes 0.42@xmath16 and 0.15@xmath16 for ag and au atoms , respectively .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to note that the preferable adsorption site for au atoms changes from t to b site .",
    "au atoms tend to bind with two s atoms that are in two different layers . for this reason ,",
    "the b - site is the most favorable site .",
    "the minimum diffusion barrier of ag atom is increased by @xmath14 170 mev after the addition of the second layer .",
    "interestingly diffusion barriers of the ag atom between bilayer mos@xmath15 from h to m and h to t sites are the same .",
    "the minimum diffusion barrier of au atom is reduced by half when a second layer is added .",
    "these results show that the diffusion behavior of ag and au atoms between bilayer mos@xmath0 are completely different .",
    "ag atoms are not likely to form clusters inside the bilayer mos@xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", au atoms may form clusters between two mos@xmath0 layers and the clusterization weight of them is larger than that on single layer of mos@xmath0 .    _",
    "mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 bilayers : _ for the geometry optimization of the mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 bilayer structure we performed full atomic and lattice parameter relaxation and therefore internal strain due to lattice mismatch is lowered to less than 1 kb . the lattice parameter of mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 is calculated to be 3.252  . for this lattice parameter ,",
    "the maximum lattice mismatch is @xmath142@xmath17 which is in the range of experimentally available strain values .",
    "when au and ag atoms are intercalated between mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 , they show the same trend ; their height above the mos@xmath0 surface are fairly close ( 1.7   for ag and 1.8   for au ) and the layer - layer distance increases from 3.1 to 3.6 and 3.7   for ag and au , respectively .",
    "h - site is the most favorable site for ag and au atoms when they are located between mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 bilayer . when ag atom is inserted in mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 , it donates 0.41@xmath16 to neighboring tmd layers .",
    "it appears that the majority of the charges are transfered to the mos@xmath15 layer .",
    "similarly the au atom loses 0.13@xmath16 charge when inserted between mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 .",
    "the minimum diffusion barrier of ag atom is increased by @xmath14 150 mev when the second layer is present .",
    "but the second favorable site does not change with the addition of the mose@xmath15 layer ( m ) .",
    "the minimum diffusion barrier of au atom increases from 23 to 75 mev with mose@xmath15 addition .",
    "second favorable site of au atom changes from h to b site when mose@xmath15 layer is added .",
    "similar to mos@xmath0/mos@xmath0 , the jump probability of ag atom becomes zero with the addition of mose@xmath0 as a second layer .",
    "the @xmath11 value of au atom decreases from 0.411 to 0.055 with the addition of mose@xmath0 layer .",
    "therefore , the formation of ag cluster between mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 bilayer heterostructure is hindered by the presence of the second layer .",
    "the nucleation of au clusters may happen with a slower nucleation rate in mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 as compared to monolayer mos@xmath15 .    _",
    "mos@xmath15/ws@xmath15 bilayers : _ the lattice mismatch between mos@xmath15 and ws@xmath15 is negligible and the lattice parameter of the bilayer structure was calculated to be 3.182  . both au and",
    "ag atoms prefer to be bonded on the h site 1.85   away from the surface of mos@xmath15 .",
    "when ag and au atoms are inserted between mos@xmath15/ws@xmath15 , the interlayer distances increase from 3.09 to 3.71 and 3.74  , respectively .",
    "we found that the ag atom donates 0.41 @xmath16 to the surrounding mos@xmath15/ws@xmath15 bilayer structure whereas the amount of charge transfer is 0.18 @xmath16 for au .",

    "the @xmath11 value of ag atom becomes zero with the addition of the second layer ( ws@xmath15 in this case ) .",
    "on the other hand , addition of a ws@xmath15 layer does not change the @xmath11 value of the au atom between mos@xmath15/ws@xmath15 , significantly . as a result ,",
    "ag atoms are not likely to form clusters when intercalated in mos@xmath15/ws@xmath15 , while the clusterization probability of au atoms does almost not change with ws@xmath15 layer addition .",
    "we found that the binding energy of ag and au atoms is maximum when they are placed on mos@xmath0 and mose@xmath0 , respectively and the binding energy of these atoms on graphene is lower than that on tmds .",
    "ag atoms prefer to bind at the h site on tmds , while the h and the t sites are most favorable adsorption sites for au atoms . just as for the ag atom , au atom binds to h site on mose@xmath0",
    ". however , au atom binds to t site on mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 . when ag atom adsorbs on these monolayers , it tends to donate charge , whereas au atom tends to receive charge from these monolayers .",
    "calculated @xmath11 values revealed that , clusterization tendency of ag and au are the largest on graphene and mos@xmath0 layers , respectively .",
    "addition of a second layer has a considerable effect on the diffusion phenomena of ag and au atoms .",
    "ag atom binds to h site of all tmds heterostructures , whereas it binds to m site of the mos@xmath15/graphene heterostructure .",
    "when an au atom is inserted between mos@xmath15/mose@xmath15 and mos@xmath15/ws@xmath15 heterostructures , h site is the energetically most favorable site .",
