    "a nearly ubiquitous and prominent feature of disk galaxies is the presence of spiral arms .",
    "unfortunately the spiral arm structure of our own galaxy is much less obvious due to our obscured view from within its disk .",
    "luminous spiral arm tracers , especially hii regions , have been used to effectively map the main spiral arms of our galaxy ( georgelin and georgelin @xcite ) , with the help of kinematic distances .",
    "similar mappings have been made with components of the gaseous medium , such as hi and co , and more recently the direction of the galactic magnetic field , which is presumably aligned with the arms , has been inferred from studies of pulsar radio observations . from such studies",
    "it is usually inferred that the milky way has four spiral arms with a pitch angle of approximately @xmath1 ( see vallee @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "apart from such spatial mappings , three of the spiral arms directly evidence themselves in galactic plane emission profiles as features in the directions of the arm tangents where the column flux density of the associated material is greatest .",
    "if the spiral structure is produced by a non - axisymmetric component in the stellar distribution , where the majority of the disk mass resides , then the observed gas and optical spiral tracers make up a small fraction of the total mass actually associated with the spiral arms . to directly observe the mass associated with spiral structure one must observe the old stellar population , which is best traced by k band imagery ( rix and zaritsky @xcite ) . alternatively",
    ", the spiral structure could be produced by self - propagating star formation in a differentially rotating medium , which has been shown with simulations to produce spiral arms ( seiden et al .",
    "@xcite , jungwiert and palous @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the spiral pattern in k would be produced solely by young stars , which can contribute a significant fraction of the k band light in star forming regions ( rhoads @xcite ) , and will have a form consistent with the optical spiral tracers .    in this letter the k band and 240@xmath2 emission profiles of the galactic plane are recovered from cobe / dirbe data , and considered with regards to the spiral structure of the milky way . in the following section features associated with spiral arm tangents are identified , and in sect .",
    "3 the number and position of the tangents are interpreted with a simple logarithmic spiral model .",
    "galactic plane ( gp ) emission profiles in the k and 240@xmath2 bands were constructed from the zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma) sky maps produced from the cobe / dirbe data ( kelsall at al .",
    "@xcite ) . from the high resolution intensity maps ( pixel width @xmath3 )",
    "pixels within three degrees of the gp where integrated over galactic latitude after reprojecting the data into a galactic mollweide projection , using the uidl analysis package developed by nasa s goddard space flight center . the resulting emission profiles ( integrated intensity ) are shown for galactic longitudes @xmath4 in figure [ gpprof ] .",
    "the k band emission profiles for @xmath5 show no evidence of spiral arm features , with the exception of longitudes @xmath6 .",
    "emission within @xmath7 of the galactic center ( gc ) is dominated by light from the bulge of the galaxy and absorbtion from its associated dust lanes , while the very broad and prominent feature at approximately @xmath8 in the 240@xmath2 band is the orion arm .",
    "this arm is a local and relatively minor structure in the galactic disk and not a major spiral arm ( georgelin & georgelin @xcite ) ; it is prominent only by virtue of our proximity and will not be considered further .",
    "i only mention here that it s counterpart , centered at @xmath9 , is just outside the right bounds of the figure .",
    "neither do i attempt to identify features associated with this local arm or the galactic bulge .",
    "features associated with the tangents to the major spiral arms are expected appear in the galactic longitude range @xmath10 , @xmath11 . in this longitude range three types of features are identified and their peaks indicated with vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ gpprof ] : broad ( @xmath12 ) , prominent features in the k band ; strong narrow features in k ; and peak emission of broad features at @xmath0 . at negative galactic longitudes",
    "the spiral structure of the galaxy shows itself clearly in k as two broad features at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and two narrow features at @xmath15 , while the @xmath0 emission has a distinct sawtooth profile . at positive longitudes the spiral arms are less evident , with a single prominent feature at @xmath16 double peaked in both the k and 240@xmath2 bands . in k the appearance of a double peak",
    "can be attributed to absorbtion , as the 240@xmath2 peak at @xmath17 exactly corresponds to the `` valley '' between the peaks seen in k.    the identified features can be grouped by proximity in longitude in the following manner : at negative galactic longitudes there are three groups , labeled `` t '' , `` s@xmath18 '' and `` c@xmath18 '' , while at positive longitudes there are the groups `` s@xmath19 '' and `` c@xmath19 '' .",
    "though the c@xmath19 group consists of only a single feature at @xmath0 it is labeled to facilitate the following discussion .",
    "i consider the narrow feature at @xmath20 not to be sufficiently close to other features to be part of a group and leave it unlabeled . with the exception of c@xmath19 , each group consists of both 240@xmath2 and k band features and span approximately @xmath21 or more in longitude .",
    "all other unlabeled features in the k band , in the considered longitude range , have a relative peak to local background signal of less than one fourth .",
    "emission profiles at other wavebands have not been presented here . in the far - infrared cobe also observed at 100 and 140@xmath2 , which present very similar gp profiles as the 240@xmath2 data . in the near - infrared j , l and m band observations",
    "were made , but these are not as cleanly interpreted .",
    "the m band is contaminated with zodiacal emission , while the j band suffers significantly from the effects of absorbtion in the gp .",
    "the l band is in principle more transparent than the k band , however , it is not as reliable a tracer of the stellar mass in the gp as it suffers from molecular emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( dwek et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for instance , in l the s@xmath19 feature appears as a single peak , suggesting absorbtion at play in k , while the s@xmath18 feature appears double peaked , the second peak appearing at precisely the longitude of the 240@xmath2 peak ; this is a clear indication of l band emission associated with the dust .",
    "each group of features in the gp profiles can be identified with a spiral arm tangent .",
    "three of these groups possess broad k band features : s@xmath19 and s@xmath18 are tangents of the scutum arm , while the third , t , is the three - kiloparsec arm .",
    "the remaining groups , c@xmath19 and c@xmath18 , can be identified as tangents to the sagittarius - carina ( sag - car ) arm , though there are important differences in their characteristics with respect to the others in the k band .",
    "first , the feature at c@xmath18 has a distinctly different character than the broad features mentioned above , being composed of two narrow features .",
    "( the profile for @xmath22 does not blend or enhance these features above the background . ) these narrow features could be combined and considered as a single feature , but its apparent width would still be considerably less than the broad tangent features if removed to similar heliocentric distances ( from .4  .5 to .8  1.0 @xmath23 ) .",
    "more serious is the absence of a significant feature in k at @xmath24 , also noted in other infrared studies ( see table 1 of ortiz and lepine @xcite ) .",
    "if the sag - car arm was of similar amplitude as the scutum arm it would produce a tangent feature at @xmath24 of similar amplitude as the s@xmath18 feature , since spiral arm tangents at @xmath25 would have approximately the same galactocentric distance .    from the galactic longitudes of two tangents the parameters of a logarithmic spiral described by @xmath26 can be determined , where @xmath27 are galactocentric cylindrical coordinates .",
    "geometrical considerations give the tangent of the pitch angle @xmath28 , without approximation , as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the longitudes of the tangents at negative and positive longitudes respectively . using the k band s@xmath19 and s@xmath18 features at @xmath32 ,",
    "one arrives at @xmath33 .",
    "however , if the double peak of the s@xmath19 feature is due to strong absorbtion , then its true tangent may be at @xmath34 longitude . in this case",
    "in addition , a bias is introduced in the apparent tangent direction as the integrated emission comes from a curved structure with finite width .",
    "the peak emission is thus displaced toward the gc , the direction of curvature for the arm .",
    "a two degree uncertainty has been estimated for the s@xmath18 tangent longitude due to this bias and possible absorbtion effects .    the galactic longitude of other arm tangents can be found by using the pitch angle as found above and numerically solving for @xmath36 in the equation @xmath37 the longitude angle @xmath38 being a given tangent . using the position of the s@xmath18 tangent for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the tangent for the counter spiral of the scutum arm is found to be at @xmath40 , corresponding well to the observed longitude of the three - kiloparsec arm tangent . a second tangent from this arm",
    "is not expected at positive galactic longitudes , as it would pass beyond the solar circle .    at @xmath41",
    "a four - armed model can be applied .",
    "the features with the best defined peaks at this wavelength are s@xmath18 and c@xmath18 , tangents of adjacent arms . setting @xmath42 in eq .",
    "[ tang ] one can retrieve a formula similar to eq .",
    "[ tani ] for @xmath43 , and use the same approach as above to derive the other arm tangents . assuming a two degree uncertainty in the positions of the s@xmath18 and c@xmath18 peaks , the pitch angle is found to be between 11.5 and 14.2@xmath44 , consistent with previous determinations .",
    "the locations of the predicted arm tangents are shown in fig .",
    "[ gpprof ] .",
    "a comparison of the spiral arm features in the k band and @xmath41 emission profiles show important differences .",
    "the broad , prominent features in k are consistent with a two - armed spiral model , and show significant offsets from associated @xmath41 features , while the @xmath41 emission is consistent with the traditional four - arm model .",
    "specifically , there are no significant features at approximately 50 and @xmath45 in k as would be expected from a four - arm model , while the c@xmath18 ( sag - car ) feature shows distinct differences in relative size and form from the three broad features at s@xmath19 , s@xmath18 and t.    the disparity between the @xmath41 and k band emission is most cleanly interpreted as indicating that the diffuse stellar emission associated with the arms is not primarily from young stars , but from a nonaxisymmetric density variation in the old stellar population dominated by a two - arm structure .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the distribution of bright near - infrared point sources in the gp , which can be modeled with a traditional four - armed spiral component restricted to the distribution of the youngest stellar populations ( wainescoat et al .",
    "@xcite ; ortiz and lepine @xcite ; hammersley et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; the brightest ( youngest ) stars show the same structure as the optical spiral tracers , in contrast to the fainter ( older ) stars as evidenced by the diffuse near - infrared emission .",
    "[ sparm ] compares the two - arm spiral seen in the diffuse k band emission with those mapped by hii regions ( taylor and cordes @xcite ) .",
    "the spiral structure suggested by the k band emission profile for our galaxy is consistent with near - infrared observations of external galaxies , in that the arms are seen to be broad , well described as logarithmic , and more open than their counterparts at optical wavelengths ( rix and zaritsky @xcite ; grosbol and patsis @xcite ) .",
    "also worth noting is that two - armed modes are most common in k band observations of external disk galaxies , regardless of their structure at visible bands , which often can show little correlation with the spirals in the near - infrared ( seigar and james @xcite ) .",
    "the contrast between the optical and infrared spiral structure can be understood by remembering that optical spiral tracers are products of star formation in the gaseous arms .",
    "the optical spiral tracers , with the dust emission and bright infrared point sources , thus trace the response of the gas to an underlying nonaxisymmetric stellar ( mass ) distribution ; what is unique about the diffuse k band emission is that it principally traces this mass distribution .",
    "the differences in the nonaxisymmetric structure in the gas and stars noted by the above extragalactic studies and in this contribution indicate that the hydrodynamical response to a given potential is not necessarily a simple one .",
    "it has been noted in hydrodynamical simulations that the gaseous response to a barred potential can have an extended four - armed spiral structure ( englmaier and gerhard @xcite ; fux @xcite ) , while patsis etal ( @xcite ) have reproduced extensive interarm features with two - armed potentials .",
    "these simulations suggest an explanation for the relative weakness of the sag - car arm : it is an interarm or secondary arm structure , possibly bifurcating from one of the primary arms of the galaxy .",
    "however , to date dynamical models of the milky way s stellar disk that include spiral arms have used the tangents seen in optical spiral tracers _ as constraints _ ( amaral and lepine @xcite ) . the disparity between the diffuse k band and optical / gas spirals suggest that near - infrared observations will provide crucial information for reconstructing the dynamical and hydrodynamical processes responsible for producing spiral structure ."
