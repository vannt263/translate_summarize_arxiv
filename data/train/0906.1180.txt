    "one of the most simple and interesting quantum models that studies the interaction between radiation and matter is the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite .",
    "the model considers the interaction between a single two - level atom with a single mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the coupling between the atom and the field is characterized by a rabi frequency , and a loss of excitation in the atom appears as a gain in excitation of the field oscillator . the collapse and",
    "the eventual revival of the rabi oscillation , described by the analytical solution of the jcm , shows a direct evidence of the quantum nature of radiation .",
    "the use of jcm has permitted to elucidate basic properties of quantum entanglement as well as some aspects of the relationship between classical and quantum physics .",
    "since it was proposed , the pattern has been of permanent interest in the quantum theory of interactions . in the decade of the eighties",
    "it was discovered that the model exhibited highly non classic behavior , and the possibility of experimental realization appeared .",
    "the relative simplicity of the jcm and its extensions has drawn much attention in the physics community and recently in the field of the quantum computing @xcite . in this work",
    "we use a generalization of the jcm to an @xmath0 state atom interacting with a single field mode @xcite .    in @xmath1 ,",
    "shor @xcite described a quantum algorithm to decompose a number in its prime factors more efficiently than any classic algorithm .",
    "it was exponentially faster than the best known classical counterpart . in 2001 the experimental development of this algorithm has had a very interesting advance : vandersypen et _ al .",
    "_ @xcite using a seven - qubit molecule manipulated with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques has reported the factorization of the number 15 into its prime factors 3 and 5 .",
    "this algorithm illustrates a part of the theoretical challenge of quantum computation , _",
    "i.e. _ to learn how to work with quantum properties to obtain more efficient algorithms",
    ". tools like quantum parallelism , unitary transformations , amplification techniques , interference phenomena , quantum measurements , resonances , etc , must be used by the new computation science .",
    "grover , in @xmath2 , devised an algorithm @xcite which can locate a marked item from an unsorted list of @xmath0 items , in a number of steps proportional to @xmath3 , that is quadratically faster than any classical algorithm @xcite .",
    "continuous time search algorithms have been investigated by a number of researchers @xcite .",
    "the essential content of these proposals is to built a hamiltonian ( or alternatively a unitary operator ) with the aim to change the initial average state @xmath4 into another state @xmath5 , that also belongs to the same set @xmath6 of @xmath0 vector in the base of the hilbert space chuang .",
    "this last state is recognized by an unitary operator called oracle , that is part of the global unitary evolution @xmath7 , where the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath8the probability to obtain the searched state is @xmath9 , and it equals @xmath10 after a time @xmath11 . in this frame , the search algorithm is seen as a rotation in the bloch sphere from the initial average state to the searched state .",
    "recently an alternative search algorithm was developed alejo , alejo1,alejo2,alejo3 that uses a hamiltonian to produce a resonance between the initial and the searched states , having the same efficiency than the grover algorithm .",
    "it can be implemented using any hamiltonian with a discrete energy spectrum , and it was shown to be robust @xcite when the energy of the searched state has some imprecision .",
    "the responses of this algorithm to an external monochromatic field and to the decoherences introduced through measurement processes was also analyzed in @xcite .",

    "the calculations were performed using a standard fourth order runge - kutta algorithm . the procedure consisted in choosing at random the energy of the searched state and then to follow the dynamics of the set and of the initial state .",
    "we verified for several values of @xmath103 that the most important coupling is between the initial and the searched states ; the other couplings may be totally neglected .    in fig.[t2 ]",
    "we show the probabilities for all levels at five different fractions of the time @xmath88 .",
    "we see that the dispersion among the states neighboring the searched state is relatively small for @xmath87 . for higher values of @xmath103",
    "the dispersion is even smaller , this confirms that our theoretical approximation of two coupled modes is correct .",
    "furthermore we conclude that the flux transfer process is essentially an interchange between the initial and the searched states and that the optimal time to measure the searched state is @xmath88 . at other times",
    "we have less chance of perform a measurement of the searched state .",
    "fig.[t1 ] shows the oscillation of the probability flux between the initial and the searched states as a function of time for three values of @xmath103 .",
    "the time is normalized for the theoretical characteristic time @xmath88 .",
    "the evolution shows for the lower values of @xmath103 an almost periodic behavior , however for the highest value @xmath108 the behavior is completely harmonic . in this last case",
    "there is clearly a characteristic time when the probability of the searched state is maximum and very near @xmath10 and the initial state probability is near @xmath109 .",
    "the optimal time agrees with our theoretical prediction @xmath88 .",
    "this periodic behavior and the proportionality between @xmath88 and @xmath110 are also found in the grover algorithm @xcite .",
    "in this work we show how a generalized jcm to an @xmath0 state atom interacting with a single field mode can be thought of as a quantum search algorithm that behaves like the grover algorithm ; in particular the optimal search time is proportional to the square root of the size of the search set and the probability to find the searched state oscillates periodically in time .    in the past ,",
    "the biggest difficulty to build a jcm has been to obtain a single electromagnetic mode that interacts with the atomic transition .",
    "this difficulty has been overcome in the last decades thanks to the experimental advances in the handling of rydberg atoms and to the building of micro - cavity for microwaves @xcite . in the frame of this work we can interpret these devices as experimental realizations of the  analog \" @xcite grover algorithm in the trivial case of the search of a marked item in an unsorted list of 2 elements .",
    "however this new way of looking at the problem is different from the usual point of view and opens new possibilities for the jcm . in summary , in this paper we reinterpret the jcm as the first step to build a more generic search algorithm with a large number of elements"
