    "studies of the evolution of late - type close binary systems reveal that the evolution of detached , semi - detached and contact systems are closely related ( yakut & eggleton 2005 , eggleton 2010 and reference therein ) .",
    "the more massive star in a detached binary system fills its roche lobe first because it has shorter evolutionary timescale before its companion .",

    "some light curves ( lc8 , lc15 ) , however , can be represented theoretically by a hot surface on the cooler companion .",
    "the presence of a hot region , that may be attributed to a mass transfer other than a magnetic activity , could not be proved with the long - term data .",
    "long term photometric light and period variation of the close binary system are studied in detail .",
    "the physical parameters we have determined and listed in table  6 . because of poor quality data in the previous studies the @xmath18 curve was inferred to be parabolic one . in this study with our data we show that the system has a third body with a 92.3 years orbital period . since the primary component filled its roche lobe we searched for a clue for the mass transfer by a technique other than the @xmath18 analysis . separate solutions of six available light curves starting from 1950 to present indicate a period decrease .",
    "the period change variation vs. years shows a downward parabola .",
    "this can be considered as a mass transfer from the more massive companion to the less massive one .",
    "this solution yields the amount of the period decrease as @xmath59 d / yr with a mass transfer rate of @xmath60 m@xmath61/yr .",
    "in addition , the period of this parabolic variation is too long to detect in the @xmath18 curve constructed with the available data .",
    "the system has been studied spectroscopically but no accurate radial velocity study of it is available in the literature . in systems like",
    "go cyg the luminous primary star makes it difficult to treat the system as a double - lined binary .",

    "yakut & eggleton , 2005 , drilling & landolt 2000 ) to estimate the primary s ( the massive and lumonious one ) mass . by studying stars with similar luminosities and spectral types ,",

    "this is also consistent with the values given in the literature .",

    "russell diagrams given by yakut & eggleton ( 2005 ) .",
    "our results shows that go cyg has the most massive components among the known ncb systems .",
    "we collected physical parameters of the ncb systems whose primary components are relatively massive ( table  7 ) .",
    "mass - luminosity diagram of binaries listed in table  7 is shown in fig  4 .",
    "the locations of go cyg a and b in the @xmath63 diagram are consistent with the other ncb systems .",
    "observational results of semi - detached systems show that while in some cases the primary component fills its roche lobe ( go cyg ) in other cases the secondary fills its roche lobe ( v836 cyg , yakut et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "these differences are a sign for the evolutionary stage of the binary system ( for details we refer yakut & eggleton 2005 , eggleton 2006 , eggleton 2010 ) .",
    "the orbital , geometrical , and physical parameters of go cyg presented in this study indicate the roche lobe filling star is the primary ( the massive and the hotter one ) .",
    "we show that the primary may even transfer mass with at a low rate .",
    "contrary to the very low mass stars , mass loss rate due to the magnetic stellar winds can be expected since the convective layer is small in the systems with intermediate / low mass components ( e.g. go cyg ) .",
    "the results indicate the system go cyg evolves under the proximity effect , low rate mass transfer between the components ( @xmath64 m@xmath65/yr ) and the third body can also remove angular momentum from the binary orbit .",
