    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall the setup and motivation .",
    "the theory of polynomial representations of @xmath0 is closely tied to the theory of polynomial functors , or equivalently , the theory of polynomial representations of the infinite general linear group @xmath1 .",
    "the main important property is that polynomial functors can be evaluated on a vector space , and this evaluation is an exact functor .",
    "when one attempts to generalize this theory to the orthogonal and symplectic groups , a few complications arise . in @xcite , we introduced an analogue of the category of polynomial functors for these groups along with an evaluation functor ; however , it fails to be right - exact ( or left - exact , depending on the conventions used ) . in @xcite , we compute the higher derived functors on simple objects .",
    "in fact , the calculation of the euler characteristic of these functors appeared in the literature much earlier in @xcite , though not under this setup .",
    "while this accounts for all finite - dimensional representations of the orthogonal and symplectic groups , there is an issue remaining : the orthogonal group has a double cover , the pin group , which has many more finite - dimensional representations ( in some sense , the representations that factor through the orthogonal group only account for `` half '' of them ) , the so - called spinor representations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop an analogous functorial theory for spinor representations .",
    "in fact , when dealing with spinor representations from a multilinear perspective , as we do in this paper , it becomes transparent that there is a parallel theory of oscillator representations ( which are infinite - dimensional ) for the symplectic lie algebra , so we develop them both simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , it will follow that the correct version of a symplectic lie algebra on an odd - dimensional space to use here is the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra of a symplectic space with @xmath2 odd variable ( the finite - dimensional representation theory of this lie superalgebra is semisimple , unlike the stabilizer lie algebra of a maximal rank alternating form on a @xmath3 dimensional space , and also unlike most other finite - dimensional classical lie superalgebras ) .    as in @xcite ,",
    "the first step is to construct a category of `` infinite rank '' spinor ( or oscillator ) representations and evaluation functors to the representation categories in finite rank .",
    "the idea of working with tensor categories of representations of infinite rank lie algebras previously appeared in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we give three different models for these categories : one in terms of multilinear algebraic constructions , one in terms of diagram categories , and one in terms of finite length modules over a twisted lie ( super)algebra .",
    "the latter interpretation allows us to use intuition from commutative algebra and there is an advantage in using modules which are not finite length ( see @xcite for this line of inquiry in the case of orthogonal and symplectic groups ) . in particular , we use this interpretation to construct explicit projective resolutions for the simple objects in the infinite rank category .",
    "we then calculate the homology of these complexes after applying the evaluation functor . as in @xcite",
    ", this calculation proceeds by interpreting the homology groups as tor groups for certain modules over a lie algebra which is the nilpotent radical in a larger classical lie ( super)algebra ( coming from a howe dual pair ) , and this tor is calculated using the `` geometric technique '' explicated in @xcite .",
    "one difference is that in @xcite , the nilpotent radical is always abelian , so that one is strictly dealing with commutative rings . as a side product , we find analogues of determinantal ideals in the universal enveloping algebras of free @xmath4-step nilpotent lie ( super)algebras and calculate their minimal free resolutions in  [ sec : determinantal ]",
    ".    finally , some of the results in this paper are foreshadowed by existing combinatorial results . the universal character ring for symplectic and orthogonal groups developed in @xcite provide alternative bases for the ring of symmetric functions which behave very similarly to the schur functions .",
    "in fact , there is a third such basis with the same multiplication structure constants ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6 ) which summarizes @xcite ) .",
    "this paper shows that this basis comes from an analogous theory of universal character ring for spinor representations ( or oscillator representations ) , see also @xcite for an elaboration on the combinatorics .",
    "we always work over the complex numbers @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the category of polynomial representations of @xmath7 , see @xcite for its basic properties and other equivalent categories .",
    "we will freely make use of schur functors @xmath8 ; for background , the reader might consult @xcite .",
    "the symmetric group on @xmath9 letters is denoted @xmath10 .",
    "we will also make use of standard partition notation , see @xcite for basic definitions .",
    "the transpose of a partition @xmath11 is denoted @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the set of partitions with the following inductive definition .",
    "the empty partition belongs to @xmath13 .",
    "a non - empty partition @xmath14 belongs to @xmath13 if and only if the number of rows in @xmath14 is one more than the number of columns , i.e. , @xmath15 , and the partition obtained by deleting the first row and column of @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath16 , belongs to @xmath13 .",
    "the first few partitions in @xmath13 are @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "define @xmath21 .",
    "we write @xmath22 for the set of @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and similarly we define @xmath25 .",
    "the significance of these sets are the following decompositions ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a.7 , ex .",
    "4,5 ) ) : @xmath26    [ rmk : q1-num ] each partition in @xmath13 is a union of certain hook partitions which are determined by their first part @xmath27 .",
    "so alternatively , they can be specified by a strictly decreasing sequence @xmath28 .",
    "so the total number of partitions @xmath29 with @xmath30 is @xmath31 . in particular , the total number of partitions @xmath32 with @xmath33 is also @xmath31 .",
    "given a partition @xmath11 , let @xmath34 denote the size of its main diagonal .",
    "given two vector spaces @xmath35 , let @xmath36 denote the @xmath37-graded vector space with even part @xmath38 and odd part @xmath39 .",
    "finally , @xmath40 is usually used to denote the highest weight of the spinor representation ( so implicitly @xmath40 depends on the rank of the group , but will usually be clear from the context ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 will be used to denote the highest weight of the oscillator representation .",
    "we thank robert laudone for carefully going through the formulas in  [ sec : spinor ] and pointing out some scalar errors that were originally present .",
    "let @xmath42 , let @xmath43 be its restricted dual , and put @xmath44 we let @xmath45 be a basis vector for the one dimensional space @xmath5 in @xmath46 .",
    "we put an orthogonal form @xmath47 on @xmath48 by @xmath49 we extend this to an orthogonal form , also called @xmath47 , to @xmath46 by setting @xmath50 and @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "put @xmath53 we regard @xmath54 as @xmath55-graded , with @xmath56 of degree  1 , @xmath57 of degree  @xmath58 , and @xmath45 of degree  0 .",

    "suppose @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath70 we define the action on @xmath71 in an analogous manner : @xmath72 we also put @xmath73 then @xmath54 is closed under the lie bracket on @xmath74 and so is a lie algebra .",
    "it preserves the orthogonal form on @xmath46 , and can be rightfully called @xmath75 .",
    "we call @xmath46 the * standard representation * of @xmath54",
    ". a representation of @xmath54 is * algebraic * if it appears as a subquotient of a finite direct sum of tensor powers of the standard representation .",
    "the category of algebraic representations is denoted @xmath76 and is studied in @xcite .",
