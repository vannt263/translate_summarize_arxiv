    "the graph polynomial of @xmath5 is defined by associating a variable @xmath6 to every edge @xmath7 of @xmath5 and setting @xmath8 where the sum is over all spanning trees @xmath9 of @xmath5 .",
    "these polynomials first appeared in kirchhoff s work on currents in electrical networks @xcite .",
    "the arithmetic content of perturbative quantum field theories is given by integrals of rational functions , whose denominator is the square of the graph polynomial .",
    "this requires a convergency condition for the graphs .",
    "a connected graph @xmath5 is called primitive - divergent ( see fig .",
    "1 ) if @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the number of loops ( first betti number ) and @xmath14 the number of edges in a graph @xmath15 .",
    "it is easy to see that primitive - divergent graphs with at least three vertices are simple : they have no multiple edges or self - loops .    if @xmath5 is primitive - divergent , the period of @xmath5 is defined by the convergent integral @xcite , @xcite ( which is independent of the choice of edge @xmath16 ) @xmath17 in this way , @xmath18 defines a map from the set of primitive - divergent graphs to positive real numbers . in the case of @xmath11 theory",
    "they are renormalization - scheme independent contributions to the @xmath19-function @xcite .",
    "since @xmath20 is defined over the integers , it defines an affine scheme of finite type over @xmath21 which is called the graph hypersurface @xmath22 . for any field @xmath23",
    ", we can therefore consider the zero locus @xmath24 of @xmath25 in @xmath26 .",
    "if the ground field @xmath27 is finite , we have the point - counting function @xmath28_q : q \\mapsto \\",
    "# x_g({{\\mathbb f}}_q ) \\in { { \\mathbb n}}.\\ ] ] it defines a map from prime powers to non - negative integers .",
    "inspired by the appearance of multiple zeta values in the period integral @xcite , kontsevich informally conjectured in 1997 that the function @xmath29 $ ] might be polynomial in @xmath30 for all graphs @xcite .",
    "although the conjecture is true for small graphs @xcite and for certain sets of nearly complete graphs @xcite , @xcite , it is false in general . in @xcite belkale and brosnan used mnv s universality theorem to prove that the @xmath29 $ ] for arbitrary graphs are , in a certain sense , of general type . in @xcite , @xcite",
    "we proved the conjecture is true for some infinite families of graphs in @xmath11 theory .",
    "nonetheless a connection between the point - counting function and the period @xmath31 remains valid in all cases .",
    "recent work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite shows that certain information about the period is indeed detected by a small piece of the point - counting function @xmath29_q$ ] , called the @xmath4-invariant .",
    "[ prop0 ] @xcite if @xmath5 has at least three vertices there exists a quantity @xmath32 where @xmath30 ranges over the set of prime powers and @xmath33 is defined as follows .",

    "when this happens , we say that the @xmath4-invariant is constant .",
    "in other words , the @xmath4-invariant is said to be constant if and only if it is in the image of the map @xmath38 any graph @xmath5 with a non - constant @xmath4-invariant is therefore a counter - example to kontsevich s problem .",
    "the connection between the period and the @xmath4-invariant is further borne out by the following conjecture , which holds in all presently known examples :      this conjecture is supported by @xcite , where it is shown that , for a large class of graphs , the @xmath4-invariant is related to the de rham framing on the cohomology of the graph hypersurface given by the integrand of ( [ 2 ] ) .      since graph polynomials are not polynomially countable @xcite , and more to the point , the period @xmath31 does not factorize through a category of mixed tate motives @xcite , it follows from standard conjectures in transcendence theory that the integral @xmath31 will not be a multiple zeta value in general .",
    "an important question is to try to ascertain which families of periods do occur as values of @xmath31 , especially when one places physically meaningful restrictions on the graphs @xmath5 . due to the immense difficulty of computing the periods ( [ 2 ] ) directly , or even to obtain any non - trivial information about the mixed hodge structure or motive @xcite underlying ( [ 2 ] ) beyond 6 loops ,",
    "one is forced to find new methods to probe the arithmetic content of @xmath11 theory at high loop orders .",
    "the goal of this paper is to argue that the @xmath4-invariant gives an effective method to do just this , and to report on an experimental study of all @xmath4-invariants of primitive @xmath11-graphs with up to and including @xmath43 loops .",
    "note that a naive approach to computing the point - counting functions @xmath29_q$ ] , for any @xmath30 , is completely impossible : at ten loops the graph polynomials @xmath25 are of degree 10 in 20 variables , and have thirty to forty thousand monomials .",
    "furthermore , there are several thousand primitive divergent graphs .",
    "the main point is that the @xmath4-invariant satisfies sufficiently many combinatorial properties to reduce this to a manageable computation .    a first reduction , which uses graph - theoretical arguments together with a weakened version of conj .  [ con2 ]",
    "( see conj .",
    "[ con4 ] ) allows us to reduce the number of relevant cases to 284 ` prime ancestors ' ( see thm .",
    "[ thm3 ] ) .",
    "the number of prime ancestors at a certain loop order is listed in tab .  2 . a second , crucial , reduction is thm .",
    "[ thm4 ] , which reduces the @xmath4-invariant of the hypersurface @xmath44 to that of a hypersurface of much smaller dimension , for which the points can be counted for at least the first 6 primes in all 284 cases .",
    "this is enough to distinguish 145 @xmath4-invariants which are listed in tab s .",
    "7 and 8 at the end of the article . for graphs up to 9 loops we computed the @xmath4-invariants of their prime ancestors for the first 12 primes ( tab .",
    "6 ) .      for small graphs",
    "( with @xmath45 loops @xcite ) the @xmath4-invariant is constant and it is known that the integral @xmath31 is a linear combination of multiple zeta values @xcite , @xcite . at 7 loops , we find the first examples of @xmath4-invariants which are quasi - constant @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath4 is constant after excluding finitely many primes , or by passing to a finite field extension ( def .",
    "[ def7 ] ) .",
    "experimentally , we find that for graphs in @xmath11 theory up to 10 loops , only the constants @xmath46 , and three other quasi - constants can occur corresponding to extending by 2nd , 3rd and 4th roots of unity ( conj .",
    "[ con5 ] ) .",
    "all these examples correspond to tate motives .",
    "the first non - tate examples occur at 8 loops .",
    "we say that a @xmath4-invariant is _ modular _ if the point - counts @xmath47 over finite fields @xmath48 where @xmath49 is prime , coincide with the @xmath49th fourier coefficients of a modular form ( possibly with a non - trivial character ) . in @xcite",
    "we proved using modularity theorems for singular k3 surfaces that a certain graph with 8 loops is modular for all primes @xmath49 .",
    "no such theorem is currently available for any other @xmath4-invariant .",
    "therefore , we shall abusively say that a graph @xmath5 is modular if @xmath47 coincides with the fourier coefficients of a modular form for small @xmath49 . in practice , computing just a handful of primes is enough to fix the character of @xmath4 uniquely : for instance , the likelihood of a false identification after counting points over the first 11 primes is of the order of one in @xmath50 .",
    "thus we can be fairly confident that our experimentally - modular graphs ( modular for at least the first 11 primes ) are indeed modular for all primes .",
    "motivated by the 8-loop example , we searched for other modular examples of primitive - divergent graphs @xmath5 in @xmath11 theory up to and including 10 loops .",
    "the output of this search is summarized in tab .  1 .",
    "in total 16 out of the ( at least ) 145 @xmath4-invariants of graphs with @xmath51 loops in @xmath11 theory are modular for ( at least ) the first 11 primes .",
    "the modular forms that correspond to these @xmath4-invariants are in heavy boxes in tab .  1 .",
    "one immediately notices from tab .",
    "1 that the modular forms coming from @xmath11 graphs have very low levels and never have weight 2 . with our data",
    "we can rule out ( assuming conj .",
    "[ con4 ] ) weight 2 modularity for all levels up to 1200 in graphs with @xmath52 10 loops .",
    "this absence of weight 2 should be a general property of primitive @xmath11-graphs ( conj .",
    "[ con6 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we only found levels 7 , 8 , and 12 at weight 3 .",
    "remarkably , all these modular forms were already found in graphs with not more than 9 loops ( the lower index in the boxes ) . at weight 4",
    "we found modular forms of level 5 , 6 , 7 , 13 , and 17 . at weight 5",
    "only level 4 could be identified . at weight 6",
    "we had modular forms of levels 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 , whereas at weights 7 and 8 levels 3 and 2 , 5 could be found .",
    "we observe a tendency to higher weight for higher loop order .",
    "otherwise we are not aware of any particular pattern in the identified modular forms .    in order to investigate the effect of the topology of the graph on the @xmath4-invariant",
    ", we also computed the @xmath4-invariants of all log - divergent graphs ( graphs which satisfy ( [ defnprimdiv ] ) and ( [ defnprimdiv1 ] ) , but which are not necessarily in @xmath11 theory , see fig .",
    "6 ) up to and including 9 loops .",
    "these additional graphs give rise to the first three levels of weight 2 and fill in the gap at level 11 of weight 3 .",
    "they are shown in light boxes in tab .  1 .",
    "moreover , already at 8 loops there exists a non-@xmath11 graph with a quasi - constant @xmath4-invariant which does not occur in the set of @xmath11 graphs with up to 10 loops .",
    "its point - count ( [ 24 ] ) is given by the number of zeros of @xmath53 , which is not cyclotomic . in conclusion",
    ", it seems that the point - counting functions of ` physical graphs ' ( i.e.  in @xmath11 ) are highly constrained compared to the set of all graphs .",
