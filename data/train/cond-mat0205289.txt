    "within the mode - coupling theory for ideal glass transitions ( mct ) , the dynamics of an amorphous system of strongly interacting spherical particles is described by @xmath4 functions of time @xmath0 , @xmath5 .",
    "these are autocorrelation functions of density fluctuations with wave - vector modulus @xmath6 chosen from a grid of @xmath4 values .",
    "the theory is based on a closed set of coupled nonlinear equations of motion for the @xmath7 .",
    "the coupling coefficients in these equations are given in terms of the equilibrium structure functions .",
    "the latter are assumed to be known smooth functions of the control parameters of the system like , e.g. , the packing fraction @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the mct equations exhibit fold bifurcations @xcite at certain critical values of the control parameters , say at @xmath9 , describing a transition from ergodic liquid dynamics for @xmath10 to non - ergodic glass dynamics for @xmath11 .",
    "the transition is accompanied by the evolution of a slow stretched dynamics that was suggested as the explanation of structural relaxation observed in glass - forming liquids .",
    "the leading - order asymptotic solutions of the equations for parameters approaching the transition provide predictions for the universal properties of glassy dynamics @xcite .",
    "these predictions have been tested extensively against experimental data and molecular - dynamics - simulation results @xcite .",
    "the outcome of these tests qualifies mct as a candidate for a theory of structural relaxation in glass - forming systems .",
    "it was shown that schematic mct models exhibit also higher - order - bifurcation singularities like the cusp and swallow - tail bifurcation .",
    "the accompanying dynamics is utterly different from the one for the fold bifurcation .",
    "for example , in certain parameter regions , the leading order result reads @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this logarithmic decay is equivalent to a susceptibility spectrum that is independent of frequency @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or to a @xmath15-noise fluctuation spectrum .",
    "there are corrections to this leading - order result which alter qualitatively the straight @xmath16-versus-@xmath17 lines or the plateaus of the @xmath18-versus-@xmath19 plots .",
    "one needs to understand these corrections if one intends to get an overview of the relaxation scenarios for parameters near the higher - order - bifurcation points .",
    "it is he goal of this paper to provide such understanding by construction of a general theory for the logarithmic - relaxation law and its leading corrections .    for parameters at a cusp singularity of schematic @xmath20 models , the leading - order long - time decay follows the law @xmath21 .",
    "this law has been embedded in a leading - order description of the dynamics near the singularities in terms of multi - parameter scaling laws @xcite .",
    "it was shown by l.  sjgren that dielectric - loss spectra for certain polymers could be interpreted by this scaling - law description @xcite , and further work extended his analysis @xcite .",
    "however , it was also demonstrated that the cited decay laws at the critical points have to be complemented by their leading corrections in order to describe the numerical solutions of mct equations within a time regime relevant for data analysis @xcite .",
    "but , so far it was not possible to evaluate the corrections for the mentioned scaling laws .",
    "the results of this paper will be obtained along a different route of asymptotic expansion of the mct solutions than followed in ref .",
    ".    logarithmic decay of correlations for glassy systems has been observed , for example , in monte - carlo - simulation results for a spin - glass model @xcite , for photon - correlation data from a dense colloidal suspension @xcite , and for optical kerr - effect data for a van  der  waals liquid @xcite .",
    "but the present work is motivated by three recent discoveries",
    ". first , density correlators @xmath7 measured by photon - correlation spectroscopy for colloids of micellar particles demonstrated logarithmic decay within time windows of two orders of magnitude in size @xcite .",
    "second , the mct equations for a system whose structure was described by baxter s model for sticky hard spheres exhibit cusp bifurcations @xcite .",
    "these findings have been corroborated by a comprehensive analysis of the glass transitions of a square - well system @xcite .",
    "third , logarithmic decay extending over three decades in time was found in a molecular - dynamics simulation for a system with an interaction given by a strong repulsion complemented by a short - ranged attraction @xcite .",
    "one concludes that higher - order bifurcation singularities are not restricted to schematic models and that there are reasons to suggest the search for such singularities in colloids with short - ranged attraction .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide a detailed discussion of the qualitative features , which are characteristic for the relaxation in systems near higher - order bifurcations .",
