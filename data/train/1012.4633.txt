    "the last decade has been especially challenging for hadron structure .",
    "new experimental data have shaken our understanding of qcd low - energy phenomenology .",
    "this earthquake had its epicenter on charmonium spectroscopy . since gell - mann conjecture , most of the meson experimental data were classified as @xmath0 states according to @xmath1 irreducible representations .",
    "its simplicity had converted meson spectroscopy in an ideal system to learn about the properties of qcd .",
    "nevertheless a number of interesting issues remain still open as for example the understanding of some @xmath2-meson data obtained on the b factories or the structure of the scalar mesons .",
    "some of the @xmath3 states can be hardly accommodated in a pure @xmath4 description .",
    "they present a mass much lower than the nave prediction of constituent quark models . besides , the underlying structure of the scalar mesons is still not well established theoretically .",
    "these discrepancies gave rise to the hypothesis about possible contributions of higher order fock space components allowed by the gell - mann classification .",
    "these ideas were simultaneously extended to the baryon sector , enlightening some of the obscure remaining problems .    in this",
    "talk we give an overview of the old dream of getting a coherent understanding of the low - energy hadron phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "we make emphasis on two different aspects .",
    "firstly , we will address the study of meson and baryon spectroscopy in an enlarged hilbert space considering four and five quark components .",
    "this seems nowadays unavoidable to understand the experimental data and it builds the bridge towards the description in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom . secondly , the same scheme used to describe the hadron spectroscopy should be valid for describing the low - energy hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "we review our recent efforts to account for the strangeness @xmath5 and @xmath6 two- and three - baryon systems within the same scheme used for hadron spectroscopy and that has also demonstrated its validity for the nucleon - nucleon sector .",
    "in particular we will address three different problems .",
    "in the first section we will discuss the charmonium spectroscopy above the threshold for the production of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the second section is devoted to study the effect of selected s - wave meson - baryon channels to match poor baryon mass predictions from quark models with data .",
    "finally , the third section addresses the problem of the study of two- and three - baryon systems with strangeness @xmath5 and @xmath6 by means of a baryon - baryon interaction derived from the quark model used to study the hadron spectroscopy .",
    "charmonium has been used as the test bed to demonstrate the color fermi - breit structure of quark atoms obeying the same principles as ordinary atoms  @xcite .",
    "its nonrelativistic character ( @xmath7 gave rise to an amazing agreement between experiment and simple quark potential model predictions as @xmath8 states  @xcite .",
    "close to the threshold for the production of charmed mesons quark - antiquark models required of an improved interaction  @xcite .",
    "the corrections introduced to the quark - antiquark spectra explained some deviations observed experimentally @xcite .    since 2003",
    ", we have witnessed a growth of puzzling new charmonium mesons , like the well - established @xmath9 or the not so well - established @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the belle collaboration has reported the observation of similar states with non - zero electric charge : the @xmath19 , the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 that have not yet been confirmed by other experiments  @xcite .",
    "these new states do not fit , in general , the simple predictions of the quark - antiquark schemes and , moreover , they overpopulate the expected number of states in ( simple ) two - body theories .",
    "this situation is not uncommon in particle physics .",
    "for example , in the light scalar - isoscalar meson sector hadronic molecules offer a reasonable explanation of the experimental data  @xcite . also , the study of the @xmath22 system above the pion production threshold required new degrees of freedom to be incorporated in the theory , either as pions or as excited states of the nucleon , i.e. , the @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this discussion suggests that charmonium spectroscopy could be rather simple below the threshold production of charmed mesons but much more complex above it .",
    "in particular , the coupling to the closest @xmath24 system , referred to as _ unquenching the nave quark model _",
    "@xcite , could be an important spectroscopic ingredient .",
    "besides , hidden - charm four - quark states could explain the overpopulation of quark - antiquark theoretical states .    in an attempt to disentangle the role played by multiquark configurations in the charmonium spectroscopy",
    "we have solved the lippmann - schwinger equation for the scattering of two @xmath2 mesons looking for attractive channels that may contain a meson - meson molecule  @xcite . in order to account for all basis states we allow for the coupling to charmonium - light two - meson systems .",
    "when we consider the system of two mesons @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) in a relative @xmath28state interacting through a potential @xmath29 that contains a tensor force then , in general , there is a coupling to the @xmath30 @xmath31wave and the lippmann - schwinger equation of the system is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the two - body amplitude , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the angular momentum , isospin and energy of the system , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the initial , intermediate , and final orbital angular momentum and spin ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the relative momentum and reduced mass of the two - body system , respectively . in the case of a two @xmath2 meson system that can couple to a charmonium - light two - meson state , for example when @xmath42 is coupled to @xmath43 , the lippmann - schwinger equation for @xmath42 scattering becomes @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "we have consistently used the same interacting hamiltonian to study the two- and four - quark systems to guarantee that thresholds and possible bound states are eigenstates of the same hamiltonian .",
    "this study has been the first systematic analysis of four - quark hidden - charm meson - meson molecules .",
    "for the first time a consistent study of all quantum numbers within the same model was performed .",
    "our predictions robustly show that no deeply bound states can be expected for this system .",
    "only a few channels , see table  [ t1 ] , can be expected to present observable resonances or slightly bound states . among them , we have found that the @xmath42 system must show a bound state slightly below threshold with quantum numbers @xmath46 , that could correspond to the widely discussed @xmath9 .",

    ". it would be the only candidate to accommodate a wide resonance for the @xmath47 system .",
    "for the @xmath53 the attraction is stronger and structures may be observed close and above the charmed meson production threshold .",
    "also , we have shown that the @xmath55 @xmath53 channels are attractive due to the coupling to the @xmath43 and @xmath56 channels , respectively .",
    "[ f1 ]    among these exotic theoretical states , charged states have an unique feature : by construction they can not be accommodated into the conventional @xmath8 spectrum .",
    "two different experimental findings show positive results on charge charmonium mesons .",
    "the first one was a @xmath57 peak at about 4430 mev / c@xmath58 observed by belle in the @xmath59 decays  @xcite .",
    "a second positive observation was reported by belle from the @xmath60 decay , with two resonances in @xmath61 at masses of about 4050 and 4250 mev / c@xmath58  @xcite . in the first case",
    ", babar has presented its own analysis  @xcite performing a detailed study of the acceptance and possible reflections concluding that no significant signal exists on the data . while the two experiments made different conclusion , the data itself seem to be in a reasonable agreement except for the lower available statistics of the babar experiment .",
    "the states found in ref .",
    "@xcite could correspond to the @xmath53 @xmath62 we have predicted  @xcite .",
    "its confirmation would represent a unique tool in discriminating among different theoretical models .",
    "as we have seen above , there is nowadays compelling evidence of meson resonances containing more than quark - antiquark @xmath63 valence components . one can guess a similar situation for some baryon resonances that may contain more than three - quark @xmath64 valence components . in the baryon sector",
    "a paradigmatic case is the @xmath65 which requires the consideration of a @xmath66 component for its explanation . in the meson sector",
    "scalars such as the f@xmath67 s contain relevant meson - meson components .",
    "in all these cases valence quark models based on  @xmath68 or @xmath0 components that describe correctly the bulk of spectral data fail systematically to reproduce their masses .",
    "actually we can interpret the systematic failure in the description of a given resonance by valence quark models as an indication of its anomalous nature in the sense of containing more than the valence components .",
    "here we use this interpretation as a criteria to identify possible anomalies in the light - quark baryon spectrum ( lqbs ) .",
    "[ f2 ]    a comparative analysis of constituent quark models ( cqm ) predictions for the lqbs has been carried out in ref .",
    "this analysis makes clear the presence of anomalies for which @xmath68 predicted masses are significantly higher than their particle data group ( pdg ) averages  @xcite , see fig .",
    "moreover all the anomalies have in common the existence of @xmath28 wave meson - baryon thresholds with the same quantum numbers than the anomalies ( also drawn in fig .  [ f2 ] ) close above the pdg average masses .",
    "this suggests a possible contribution of these meson - baryon ( @xmath69 components to the anomalies to give a correct account of their masses . to make a rough estimate of this contribution we shall consider the coupling of the free meson - baryon @xmath70 channels to the corresponding @xmath68 states . to make effective",
    "such a coupling we parametrize the transition matrix element , @xmath71 and diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix by assuming @xmath72 being @xmath73 the predicted @xmath68 mass and @xmath74 being @xmath75 the mass of the meson - baryon threshold .",
    "the results from the diagonalization corresponding to the lowest energy states are shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . despite the shortcomings of our toy model calculation",
    "the quantitative agreement with data is spectacular ( there is only one universal parameter , @xmath76 assumed for simplicity to be the same in all cases ) .",
    "qualitatively our toy model implies that the anomalies correspond mostly to meson - baryon states but with a non - negligible three - quark probability that makes them stable against decay into @xmath77 this interpretation could need some refinement when going to a more complete model where the meson - baryon interaction were also considered ( @xmath78 then some anomalies might appear as simply meson - baryon bound states . keeping this in mind",
    "we may conclude that the coupling to selected @xmath79 channels acts as an effective healing mechanism to match deficient cqm predictions with data .",
    "furthermore the implementation of these selected channels in the analyses of data might add certainty to the existence of the anomalies and at the same time help to reconcile competing and sometimes not compatible partial wave analyses .",
    "indeed the incorporation of some of our effective inelastic @xmath79 channels in data analyses has been very relevant for the experimental extraction of the corresponding anomalies : @xmath80 for @xmath81  @xcite and @xmath82 for @xmath83  man92,cut80 .",
    "in this section , we review recent studies of two and three - baryon systems with strangeness @xmath5 and @xmath6 using two - body interactions derived from the quark model .",
    "the baryon - baryon interactions are obtained from the chiral constituent quark model @xcite . in order to derive the local @xmath84 potentials from the basic @xmath85 interaction defined above",
    "we use a born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "explicitly , the potential is calculated as follows , @xmath86 where @xmath87 in the last expression the quark coordinates are integrated out keeping @xmath88 fixed , the resulting interaction being a function of the @xmath89 relative distance . the wave function @xmath90 for the two - baryon system",

    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we constructed different families of @xmath91 interacting potentials , by introducing small variations of the mass of the effective scalar exchange potentials , that allow us to study the dependence of the results on the strength of the spin - singlet and spin - triplet hyperon - nucleon interactions .",

    "to summarize , we have reviewed some recent results of hadron spectroscopy and hadron - hadron interaction in terms of the constituent quark model .",
    "the main goal of our presentation was to highlight the complementarity of a simultaneous study of both problems in order to constrain low - energy realizations of the underlying theory , qcd .",
    "we have seen how the enlargement of the hilbert space when increasing energy , that was seen to be necessary to describe the nucleon - nucleon phenomenology above the pion production threshold , seems to be necessary to understand current problems of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "we have also tried to emphasize that spectroscopy and interaction can and must be understood within the same scheme when dealing with quark models .",
    "any other alternative becomes irrelevant from the point of view of learning about properties of qcd .    in our analysis",
    "we have shown the first systematic study of four - quark hidden - charm states as meson - meson molecules .",
    "for the first time a consistent study of all quantum numbers within the same model has been done .",
    "our predictions robustly show that no deeply bound states can be expected for charmonium .",
    "only a few channels can be expected to present observable resonances or slightly bound states . among them",
    ", we have found that the @xmath42 system must show a bound state slightly below the threshold for charmed mesons production with quantum numbers @xmath46 , that could correspond to the widely discussed @xmath9 . out of the systems made of a particle and its corresponding antiparticle , @xmath47 and @xmath53",
    ", the @xmath54 is attractive . for the @xmath53",
    "the attraction is stronger and structures may be observed close and above the charmed meson production threshold .",
    "also , we have shown that the @xmath62 @xmath53 channel is attractive and may then represent a charge state contributing to charmonium spestroscopy . due to heavy quark symmetry",
    ", the replacement of the charm quarks by bottom quarks decreases the kinetic energy without significantly changing the potential energy . in consequence ,",
    "four - quark bottomonium mesons must also exist and have larger binding energies .",
    "we have seen how the @xmath228 components , in the form of @xmath103 wave meson - baryon channels which we identify , play an essential role in the description of the anomalies , say baryon resonances very significantly overpredicted by three - quark models based on two - body interactions . as a matter of fact by considering a simplified description of the anomalies as systems composed of a free meson - baryon channel interacting with a three - quark confined component we have shown they could correspond mostly to meson - baryon states but with a non - negligible @xmath68 state probability which makes their masses to be below the meson - baryon threshold .",
    "the remarkable agreement of our results with data in all cases takes us to refine our definition and propose the dominance of meson - baryon components as the signature of an anomaly .",
    "though it is probable that these results may vary quantitatively when a more complete dynamical coupled - channel calculation is carried out we think it is reasonable not to expect major qualitative changes .",
    "we also presented results for the two and three - baryon systems with strangeness @xmath5 .",
    "we have solved the faddeev equations for the @xmath94 and @xmath126 systems using the hyperon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon interactions derived from a chiral constituent quark model with full inclusion of the @xmath229 conversion and taking into account all three - body configurations with @xmath103 and @xmath2 wave components . in the case of the @xmath94 system",
    "the inclusion of the three - body @xmath2 wave components increases the attraction , reducing the upper limit of the @xmath98 @xmath92 scattering length if the @xmath104 @xmath94 bound state does not exist .",
    "this state shows a somewhat larger sensitivity than the hypertriton to the three - body @xmath2 waves .",
    "our calculation including the three - body @xmath2 wave configurations of all relevant observables of two- and three - baryon systems with strangeness @xmath5 , permits to constrain the @xmath92 scattering lengths to : @xmath230 fm and @xmath231 fm . in the case of the @xmath126 system",
    "there exists a narrow quasibound state near threshold in the @xmath123 channel .",
    "we have presented results for the doubly strange @xmath232 and @xmath233 interactions ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "we showed that the constituent quark model predictions are consistent with the recently obtained doubly strange elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections .",
    "in particular , our results are compatible with the @xmath162 conversion cross section , important in assessing the stability of @xmath172 quasi - particle states in nuclei .",
    "it is expected that in the coming years better - quality data on all sectors discussed in this talk will become available and our results can be used to analyze these upcoming data in a model - independent way .",
