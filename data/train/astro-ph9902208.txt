    "due to their strong non - axisymmetric potential , barred galaxies exhibit peculiar stellar and especially peculiar gas kinematics when compared to normal disk galaxies without bar . since deconvolving their non - axisymmetric velocity field",
    "is difficult , the computation of consistent multi - component stationary models for these objects has proven to be a suitable method to gain further insight into the internal mass distribution and kinematics .",
    "this stationary modelling procedure can answer the question whether the observed kinematics of the galaxy agree with the model predictions derived from the observed distribution of luminous matter ( assumed that plausible corrections for the presence of dark matter can be applied ) .    for the following studies the northern hemisphere object ngc2336 was chosen .",
    "ngc2336 is an intermediate - type spiral of hubble - type @xmath2 with a prominent bar .",
    "this galaxy has not been subject to extensive morphological and kinematical studies yet .",
    "basic parameters given by tully ( @xcite ) are listed in table[baspar1 ] .",
    "ngc2336 contains sufficient amounts of warm hii - gas for emission - line - spectroscopy .",
    "as is also required for kinematic studies and deprojection , the bar lies in a non - degenerate position with respect to line of sight , i.e. its apparent major axis does not coincide with the kinematic line of nodes ( denoted @xmath3 hereafter ) .",
    "the inclination of @xmath4 ensures a fairly precise determination of the apparent axes ratios of disk , bulge and bar .",
    ".[baspar1]_basic parameters of ngc2336 as given in tully ( @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities are defined as follows : @xmath5 : right ascension and declination at the epoch 2000.0 , @xmath6 : inclination from face - on , @xmath7 : blue apparent magnitude corrected for reddening due to internal and external absorption , @xmath8 : diameter at the @xmath9 blue isophote , adjusted for projection and obscuration effects , @xmath10 : distance based on @xmath11km / sec , @xmath12 : intrinsic blue luminosity , @xmath13 : total mass of ngc2336 , @xmath14 : ratio of @xmath15-mass to blue luminosity , @xmath16 ratio of total mass to blue luminosity . _ [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]      +    to examine the effects of different disk masses @xmath17 , models 3 and 4 include disks with a @xmath18 of 5.0 and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "in contrast to models 1 and 2 , @xmath19 is placed at @xmath20 in both cases .",
    "the main difference between the two models is the presence of a periodic @xmath21-orbit in model 4 at @xmath22 ( fig . [",
    "2336dm1 ] ) , surrounded by @xmath23s .",
    "those orbits are completely missing in the corresponding surface of section of model 3 at comparable @xmath24-values .",
    "model 3 produces @xmath21-orbits only in the very center of ngc2336 .",
    "this fact is illustrated by the corresponding @xmath21-rotation curves shown in fig .",
    "[ 2336dmrot2 ] which cover a very small region only . additionally , the closed @xmath23s of model 3 around the @xmath25-orbit are surrounded by islands and semi - ergodic regions already at those low energies , a feature that is missing in model 4 .",
    "semi - ergodicity becomes more important when we proceed to higher energies ( central and right column in fig .",
    "[ 2336dm1 ] ) : at @xmath26 , in model 3 the prograde side of the phase space is dominated by a very strong ( 4:1)-resonance at @xmath27 which is surrounded by large regions of semi - ergodic motions ( upper row , central plot ) .",
    "in contrast to this , model 4 ( lower row , central plot ) exhibits a much weaker ( 4:1)-resonance at @xmath28 and nearly no semi - ergodic motion at comparable energies ( @xmath29 ) . even at the highest energy values slightly above @xmath30 ( right column ) , semi - ergodic motion plays a less important role in case of model 4 than in model 3 .",
    "both models are not able to reproduce the observed kinematics with sufficient accuracy : a @xmath18 of @xmath31 produces @xmath32-velocities that are much too low for the central @xmath32-orbits ( model 3 , fig .",
    "[ 2336dmrot1 ] , left column ) .",
    "a moderately lower @xmath18-value of @xmath33 yields a better fit ( model 4 , fig .",
    "[ 2336dmrot1 ] , right column , see also the results of the optimal model in fig .",
    "[ 2336opt1 ] which were obtained with @xmath34 ) .",
    "in addition , model 3 suffers from the fact that the humps and dips in the observed hii - rotation curves at @xmath35 and @xmath36 are not reproduced to their full extent .",
    "this is caused by the large overall disk mass ( @xmath37 ) , with a correspondingly small non - axisymmetric contribution of the bar to the total potential .",
    "therefore , the @xmath32-orbits supporting the bar structure become less elongated , and the streaming velocities of the hii - clouds along the major axis of the bar are much lower .    however , a simple reduction of @xmath18 with all the other parameters remaining fixed is no solution either , as is quite obvious from the results of model 4 ( fig .",
    "[ 2336dmrot1 ] , right column ) : with @xmath34 , the central slopes of the rotation curves of this model are too steep due to the increased importance to the non - axisymmetric bar contribution to @xmath38 and to the small bulge scale length @xmath39 . additionally , the maximum velocities of model 4 exceed the observed ones by @xmath40km / sec at @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "another feature of model 4 is the strong decline of the rotation curves after reaching the ( correct ) maximum velocities for a slit orientation of @xmath43 , which is not supported by observations , either .",
    "it can be shown that a slightly larger bulge mass ( @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 ) , increasing the mass concentrated in the center of ngc2336 , extends the hii - streaming motions along the bar to larger radii ( @xmath43 ) . at the same time , a larger @xmath39-value would induce a flatter rise of the velocities in the innermost part of ngc2336 and reduce the observed humps in model rotation curves at @xmath41 and @xmath46 to the correct height .",
    "both models produce @xmath21-orbits , the corresponding rotation curves are also computed and shown in fig .",
    "[ 2336dmrot2 ] . while model 3 ( left column ) generates @xmath21-orbits only in the very central region ( @xmath47 ) of ngc2336 , in model 4 ( right column ) @xmath21-orbits are present up to radii of @xmath48 in the case of @xmath41 and @xmath46 .",
    "as far as those orbits are present in both models , no significant differences occur between the @xmath21-rotation curves . however , supporting the results of models 1 and 2 , the @xmath21-orbits of models 3 and 4 can not explain the kinematics of the inner regions of ngc2336 , which is clearly visible for a slit position of @xmath43 .",
    "to summarize , large @xmath18-values lead to an increased axisymmetric potential component , therefore the bar becomes less important .",
    "the consequences of the massive disk in model 3 are @xmath32-streaming velocities that are in general too low by far to reproduce the observed velocity field .",
    "we draw the conclusion that a final model of ngc2336 should use a @xmath49 .",
    "the necessary adjustment of the mass distribution in the central region could then be achieved by varying other parameters , e.g.  the bulge mass , which was chosen especially low for the models 3 and 4 .",
    "the slope of the rotation curves could be adjusted by varying @xmath39 , the streaming velocities by lowering @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast to the parameters resulting from the morphological decomposition ( e.g.  component masses and scale lengths ) , @xmath50 can not be observed directly .",
    "therefore a sequence of identical models with different @xmath50-values is examined . in general , all models produce similar velocity fields .",
    "major differences occur only for a slit orientation of @xmath43 , where models with lower @xmath50 predict significantly larger humps in the rotation curves .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the rotation curves result from the @xmath32-streaming velocities  which are identical for all models  subtracted by the various @xmath50-values .",
    "in contrast to that , the other slit orientations show only minor deviations .",
    "obviously , variations of @xmath50 are an appropriate tool to adjust the velocities perpendicular to the bar major axis .",
    "upper and lower limits for @xmath50 are given by the following arguments : since @xmath51 must be located outside the bar , @xmath50 must not exceed a certain value , depending on the mass distribution in the model .",
    "this leads to an upper limit for @xmath50 . estimating the lower limit is more complicated since the height of the humps in the rotation curves is not exclusively determined by @xmath50 , but is also influenced by several other model parameters .",
    "examples for this mutual influence of several parameters are the cases of models 1 and 2 : numerical n - body - simulations of barred galaxies strongly suggest that the @xmath19 of intermediate type galaxies ( e.g.  ngc2336 ) normally is located at @xmath52 . in models 1 and 2 ( section 9.1 ) ,",
    "@xmath19 is placed at the end of the bar at @xmath53 , which in fact is the lower boundary for @xmath51 . even for the more realistic model 1 with the lower bar mass , the hii - velocities are still too small",
    "therefore , if we reduce @xmath50 of model 1 to a value shifting corotation to @xmath20 , the velocity humps of the @xmath43-rotation curve increase towards values that are in much better agreement with the observations .",
    "in the last section we used models with different bar masses ( 1 and 2 ) and different disk masses ( 3 and 4 ) to illustrate the qualitative and quantitative changes in the division of the phase space and the hii - kinematics which are caused by the variation of @xmath54 and @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of @xmath50-variations was described as well . but as was discussed in the beginning of section 9 , there are many more parameters which may induce changes in the predicted kinematics , e.g.  the scale lengths of disk , bulge and bar , @xmath55 , @xmath39 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the results of the studies of changes in the latter parameters , as well as the results of the models 1 - 4 , can be summarized in the following constraints applying to the construction of the final ngc2336-model :    1 .   since changing the vertical flattening of the bulge , @xmath57 , results in minor changes in the hii - rotation curves only",
    ", @xmath58 is chosen for the optimal model , which is well in agreement with the photometric observations .",
    "the examination of models with different offset angles @xmath59 between the bar and the @xmath3 shows that a deviation of a few degrees ( @xmath60 ) leads to small changes in the model gas kinematics that tend to change the rotation curves in the same way as do variations of the bar axis ratio @xmath61 . since the morphological decomposition of ngc2336 suggests @xmath62 as the most probable number and since a good fit to the observed velocity field",
    "can be achieved with this value , @xmath62 will be used for the final model .",
    "models with @xmath50 being varied support those values that place @xmath19 at @xmath20 . placing @xmath51 outside the bar in an interval @xmath63 is supported by results from numerical studies ( cf .",
    "athanassoula  @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "a bar-@xmath61 of @xmath64 is in good agreement with the kinematic requirements and the observations as well .",
    "the bar mass - to - light ratio should not exceed @xmath65 .",
    "6 .   due to the difficulties in determining the bulge scale length ,",
    "@xmath39 , this parameter can not be determined exactly from observations .",
    "the results of the wide range of models examined suggests that @xmath39 should lie within @xmath66 ( @xmath67kpc ) .",
    "the photometrically derived bulge mass ( @xmath68 ) is a reasonably good choice .",
    "the observed disk scale length of @xmath69 ( @xmath70kpc , unchanged in all models ) agrees well with the requirements of the rotation curves , assumed that all other parameters are precisely adjusted as well .",
    "9 .   with @xmath55",
    "unchanged , a small disk mass ( i.e.  @xmath71 ) seems to be a plausible choice when one tries to fit the model rotation curves to the observed kinematics in the outer disk regions at @xmath72 via adjusting the cloud speeds on the @xmath32-orbits beyond @xmath19 .",
    "10 . in order to adjust the height of the overshootings in the rotation curves for a slit orientation @xmath43 and to place @xmath19 at @xmath20",
    ", the pattern speed @xmath50 has to take low values @xmath73km / sec / kpc .",
    "the final model was optimized by studying 32 parameter variations with total number of @xmath74 closed orbits .",
    "finally , the best results were obtained with the parameter set listed in table [ modopt1 ] .",
    "@xmath75 [ lu / kpc]&@xmath76 + @xmath77 [ lu / kpc]&@xmath78 + @xmath61&@xmath64 + @xmath54 [ @xmath79&@xmath80 + @xmath81 & 1.5 +   + @xmath82&@xmath83 + @xmath39 [ lu / kpc]&@xmath84 + @xmath57&@xmath85 + @xmath86 [ @xmath79&@xmath87 + @xmath88 & 1.0 +   + @xmath55 [ lu / kpc]&@xmath89 + @xmath17 [ @xmath79&@xmath90 + @xmath18 & 2.5 + @xmath50 [ km / sec / kpc]&@xmath91 +    the total mass of the final model was calibrated according to equation 28 and equation 29 with the outer circular velocity value from the kinematical observations .",
    "we obtain a total mass of @xmath92 .",
    "if we identify for a rough estimate the relative mass - to - light - ratios @xmath18 and @xmath81 with the normal astrophysical values , we obtain from our optimal model : @xmath93 thus we have a bulge / disk ratio of @xmath94 and a bar / disk ratio of @xmath95 .",
    "one should keep in mind that especially the disk mass contains a certain contribution of dark matter which can not be separated within the framework of this paper . looking at the artificial rotation curves in fig . [",
    "2336opt1 ] one recognizes the excellent agreement between the artificial curves and the observed ones .",
    "not only does the optimal model produce the correct maximum rotational velocities of the slit orientations @xmath41 and @xmath46 , but also traces the overshootings of the @xmath43-rotation curve correctly .",
    "the positions of the velocity maxima and minima in the model rotation curves and the observed ones are identical . the theoretical rotation curves in fig .  [ 2336opt1 ] display gaps in the vicinity of @xmath51 , since the orbit integrator can not compute orbits near the lindblad resonances .",
    "small discrepancies that remain between observation and theory are the central parts of the rotation curves for @xmath96 and @xmath42 , where the theoretical slopes rise slightly faster than the observed ones .",
    "the morphological decomposition of the @xmath97-band image of ngc2336 seems well established , since nearly all parameters that were initially derived from the multi - component 2d model of the @xmath97-band surface brightness distribution appear in the final model with the same numerical values .",
    "there are justified exceptions , e.g.  the bulge scale length @xmath39 , where the limited spatial resolution of the images and the small area covered by the bulge component prevent us from a more precise determination .",
    "the moderate increase of the final value of @xmath39  compared to the morphological decomposition  nevertheless agrees well with observations .",
    "it is also remarkable that the bar-@xmath61 determined from observations is nearly the same as that used for the optimal model .",
    "this is not self - evident , as the inclined position of the bar in the sky makes the determination of the deprojected bar-@xmath61 difficult .",
    "uncertainties of the model parameters become large wherever the spatial resolution or the area of the @xmath0-detector is concerned : the determination of the bulge scale length @xmath39 is certainly precise to a @xmath98 level only , due to the small bulge area ( i.e.  , the small number of pixels ) and the residuals remaining after the subtraction of the bulge and disk components . for the disk ,",
    "similar uncertainties are introduced by the limited size of the detector chip which omits the outer parts of the disk , leading to an uncertainty in @xmath55 of @xmath99 .",
    "the luminous masses of disk , bulge , and bar can be determined more precisely , especially the contribution of the bar is uncertain by @xmath100 only , since the very regular disk structure ensures a reliable decomposition . for the photometrically derived values of @xmath17 and @xmath86",
    ", a precision of @xmath101 seems a realistic estimate , due to the reasons discussed above .",
    "the deprojection angles @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath59 are reliably determined with an error of @xmath60 at most , since otherwise a mismatch between the observed kinematics and that of the optimal ngc2336-model would occur in at least _ one _ slit orientation .",
    "obviously this is not the case .      from the @xmath104-analysis",
    "we conclude that the best ngc2336-models show a phase space partition characteristic for barred galaxies with a bar contributing roughly @xmath105 to the total potential : for all realistic parameter sets , an @xmath106 is produced together with @xmath21-orbits that dominate the motion in the innermost parts of the ngc2336-models at low @xmath24-values .    for energy values @xmath107 ,",
    "the @xmath21-orbits disappear , only the prograde @xmath32- and the retrograde @xmath25-family remain . in the vicinity of @xmath30 , the @xmath32-family dissolves and is replaced by higher resonances , e.g.  the ( 4:1)- and the ( 6:1)-family . the ( 4:1)-resonance ist not very strong ,",
    "so we conclude that in time dependent models the stellar bar of ngc2336 would be moderately box - shaped only .",
    "the small amount of semi - ergodicity leads to the conclusion that a time - dependent model with our optimal parameter set would be secularly stable on time scales of the bar rotation period .",
    "summarizing the results of phase space analysis , the optimal model for ngc2336 exhibits the typical behaviour of disk - dominated barred galaxies with the bar-@xmath61 and @xmath108 being moderately small .      in our studies ,",
    "special emphasis was put on the reproduction of the gas kinematics in those regions influenced by the bar , i.e.  the large streaming motions of hii - clouds orbiting on @xmath32-orbits around the center of ngc2336 . however , the overall kinematics with the observed rotational velocities in the outer regions of the disk had to be described correctly as well .",
    "our final model fulfills both requirements , as is obvious from the excellent agreement between observed and artificial rotation curves in every part of ngc2336 and for every slit orientation .",
    "moreover , the success of adjusting the outer parts of the model rotation curves is an evidence for the good deprojection performed here .",
    "otherwise the final velocities in the outer disk regions could not be fitted simultaneously for all slit directions .    in general ,",
    "all characteristic features of all velocity curves are traced well by the final model , especially the overshootings that can be observed in slit orientations of @xmath41 , @xmath46 and @xmath36 , are produced by the model to full extent .",
    "small differences between observed and artificial gas velocities remain in the innermost region of ngc2336 and are probably caused by the uncertainties in the bulge scale length @xmath39 due to possible errors in the morphological decomposition .",
    "the precise determination of the latter is difficult due to the limited spatial resolution of the @xmath0-detector and the small area covered by the bulge component .    from the observational point of view",
    "there is no necessity for including @xmath21-orbits in the final sets of closed orbits , because a perfect fit to the observed kinematics is already achieved by @xmath32-orbits alone .",
    "moreover , the possibility of @xmath21-orbits contributing significantly to the hii - kinematics in the inner part of the bar are definitely ruled out , since no model with @xmath21-orbits can account for the streaming velocities measured at a slit orientation of @xmath43 . though our final model produces a moderately strong @xmath106 and",
    "therefore numerous @xmath21-orbits , this is no contradiction to their uselessness in the case of ngc2336 , because our model does not make any statements with regard to the occupation number of single orbit families .    to correct for the presence of dark matter in the outer regions of ngc2336 , moderate corrections of the conversion factors @xmath18 and @xmath81 had to be applied in order ( i ) to produce the large streaming velocities along @xmath75 and ( ii ) to normalize the circular @xmath32-velocities in the outer disk regions : @xmath18 changed from the observationally determined value of @xmath109 to @xmath33 , while the visible bar mass ( @xmath110 ) had to be increased by only @xmath98 .",
    "the value @xmath111 is a further hint at a reliable morphological decomposition : for the bar component which is not strongly affected by a possible dark matter halo , a moderate increase of the @xmath0-@xmath81 seems plausible , especially when considering possible stellar population changes between bulge and bar that are not known in detail .",
    "summarizing the results of our kinematical analysis , the final ngc2336 model rotation curves are a very good representation of the observed velocity field . obviously , there is no necessity of including additional hydrodynamical or magnetical effects in order to explain the observed kinematics .",
    "it is also remarkable that these results can be achieved based on models that neglect spiral arms and an explicit dark halo component with independent scale length .",
    "in this paper , 2d models of the observed @xmath97-band luminosity of ngc2336 were constructed by fitting a disk , a bulge , and a bar to the observed surface brightness distribution .",
    "the resulting model was deprojected and converted to an underlying mass distribution .",
    "the total 2d potential , @xmath38 , was obtained by numerical expansions of the potential of the single components and coadding them . for the examination of test particle motions in the potential of ngc2336",
    ", we used a numerical orbit integrator , in which @xmath38 and its derivatives are implemented .",
    "the time - dependent motions of single hii - clouds are traced by a grid - based integration scheme , in which particles move on arbitrary orbits in the stationary potential of the rotating bar .",
    "the resulting partition of the phase space was examined by analysing the appropriate cuts through phase space at a given energy , the poincar surfaces of section .",
    "they provided us with the start values  coordinates and velocities  of the main orbit families constituting the bar .",
    "given those initial values , complete sets of closed orbits in a certain energy range were computed and projected to the sky . using a virtual longslit in various orientations ,",
    "artificial rotation curves were constructed and compared to the observed kinematics of the hii - gas .    in a further step ,",
    "the effects of parameter variation on the division of phase space and the predicted hii - rotation curves of numerous ngc2336-models were examined .",
    "the effects of varied @xmath54- and @xmath17-values were shown here in greater detail , while the effects of all other free parameters being changed and studied are described qualitatively .",
    "the models led to narrow limits for the parameter values of an optimal model which should ( i ) reproduce the observed hii - kinematics directly and ( ii ) use the parameter values directly obtained from the morphological decomposition procedure wherever possible .      1",
    ".   the model parameter values obtained from observations and those needed for an optimal fit of the hii - kinematics are identical ( with justified exceptions ) , therefore the aim of constructing a consistent ngc2336-model is achieved .",
    "the overall quality of the morphological decomposition model is sufficiently good to produce a realistic mass model of ngc2336 .",
    "nevertheless , to check whether the kinematically supported scale length values of bulge and disk are fully consistent with the more uncertain morphological ones , we would need @xmath0-data with ( i ) a better spatial resolution and ( ii ) larger areas covered by the detector chip . with the small pixel number and the comparably large pixel size of the @xmath112-detector , the determination of @xmath55 and especially @xmath39 remains crucial .",
    "the phase space of all acceptable models , especially the optimal one , exhibits a structure which is typical for a disk - dominated galaxy with a bar roughly contributing @xmath105 to the total potential , i.e.  small amounts of semi - ergodicity as well as the presence of the @xmath32- , @xmath21- and @xmath25-family of periodic orbits .",
    "@xmath21-orbits can definitely be excluded when one tries to fit the observed velocities within the bar , since the streaming velocities produced by them are by far too low .",
    "the optimal model favours a low pattern speed ( @xmath113km / sec / kpc ) , a small bar axis ratio ( @xmath114 ) and  compared with the luminous matter  moderately increased bar and disk masses due to the presence of dark matter ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) .",
    "an excellent agreement between the observed and the artificial rotation curves is achieved , the optimal ngc2336-model describes correctly the large streaming motions of the hii - clouds along the bar as well as the rotation velocities in the outer regions of the disk .",
    "7 .   in general ,",
    "the case of ngc2336 shows that the peculiar hii - kinematics of a strongly barred galaxy can be completely explained by consistent stationary models which are constructed from observationally derived parameter sets .",
