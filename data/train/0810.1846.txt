    "the mathematical models of contemporary physics of disordered systems can be divided into two classes  continuous and discrete .",
    "the continuous models are those in which the _ shredinger equation _ @xmath4 with random potential @xmath5 is studied while the discrete models are dealing with the _ random matrix _ of hamiltonian .",
    "these two types of models have much in common but despite the similarity they may require essentially different methods of analysis due to the following reason .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the possibility of the _ localized _ states whose wave functions are essentially differes from zero within the finite region when the system volume runs to infinity is one of the most important properties of the homogeneous disordered systems . for the continuous models of infinite volume the localized states can be recognized by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete and continuous parts with square integrated states of the discrete part considered to be localized .",
    "the energy spectrum of discrete models being the spectrum of random matrix is always discrete and for this reason one should use another criterium for states characterization in this case .",
    "the anderson criterium is one of the relevant ones@xcite .",
    "the deep theoretical analysis is possible for the one dimensional models of disordered systems which we have in mind hereafter .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the spectrum of one dimensional shredinger equation with random potential is completely discrete what is correspond to localization of all states for an arbitrary low disorder @xcite .",
    "the validity of this statement to the discrete models is arguable because of completely discrete character of spectrum of such models even in the absence of disorder when all states are delocalized . in present paper",
    "we study the character of states in the sense of anderson criterium for the case of one dimensional chain ( discrete model ) with diagonal disorder .",
    "the simple physical sense of this criterium allows one to apply it both to discrete and continuous models",
    ".    let s turn to the problem setting and consider the one dimensional diagonally disordered discrete model with the hamiltonian whose matrix has the following entries :    @xmath6    such hamiltonian describe the frenkel exciton in the chain consisting of n two - level atoms in the nearest neighbour approximation . in this model",
    "the level splitting @xmath7 of r - th atom is considered to be the random variable distributed in accordance with the function @xmath8 which is supposed known .",
    "the unit non diagonal elements of eq.(1 ) are specify the scale of energy . everywhere below the thermodynamic limit",
    "@xmath9 is implied . for this model",
    "we now set the following problem .",
    "let us suppose that the edge atom was prepared in the excited state at @xmath2 and one should calculate the probability @xmath1 for this atom to remain in the excited state at @xmath0 . from the mathematical point of view",
    "it means that the initial state of the system is described by the wavefunction ( column - vector ) @xmath10 with entries @xmath11 and one should find @xmath12 where angular brackets denote the averaging over the random level splittings @xmath7 .",
    "the temporary dependance of the wavefunction can be written as : @xmath13 .",
    "consequently the quantity of interest @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of eigen vectors @xmath14 and eigen numbers @xmath15 of the matrix eq.(1 ) as :    @xmath16    the similar quantities were analysed in the numerical study of disordered chains for instance in @xcite . regarding",
    "@xmath1 one can make the following qualitative conclusions .",
    "suppose all the eigen functions of hamiltonian eq.(1 ) are delocalized in the sense of their amplitude being nearly the same within an arbitrary region of the chain .",
    "the amplitude squared of such functions at the edge site can be estimated as @xmath17 with all @xmath18 eigen functions giving nearly the same contribution @xmath19 to eq.(2 ) .",
    "consequently , if the states of eq.(1 ) are delocalized in the above sense then in the thermodynamic limit @xmath20 . let s consider now the situation when some of the eigen functions of eq.(1 ) are localized in the sense of their amplitude being essentially non - zero only in some restricted region of the chain with the size of this region being independent on @xmath18 when @xmath9 .",
    "being defined only by the functions whose amplitude is essentially non - zero at the edge site the contribution of functions of this type to eq.(2 ) will not depend on @xmath18 . in this case",
    "@xmath1 remain finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "having in mind all above qualitative conclusions one can introduce anderson s criterium as : _ if @xmath1 is remain finite in the thermodynamic limit then in the set of eigen functions of hamiltonian eq.(1 ) there exist ones localized in the sense of anderson s criterium . _    to get some information concerning the degree of localization of eigen vectors of eq.(1 ) in some ( specified ) spectral range we now introduce the `` participation '' function defined as :    @xmath21 } |\\psi^\\lambda_n|^4\\bigg\\rangle,\\ ] ]    obviously @xmath22 .",
    "reasoning analogous to that presented above shows that if all the states within the interval @xmath23 $ ] are delocalized then @xmath24 . in the opposite case @xmath25",
    "differs from zero .",
    "moreover , the function ( 3 ) provide quantitative information concerning the average value of eigen vectors of random matrix eq.(1 ) at the edge site within the spectral interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the fantastic capabilities of modern personal computers allows one to perform direct diagonalisation of the matrix eq.(1 ) for @xmath26 and more and in such numerical experiment to `` observe '' quantities eq.(2 ) and eq.(3 ) .",
    "the theoretical calculation of these quantities is the main goal of this paper .",
    "the main results obtained in the present paper are :    \\1 .",
    "the perturbation theory for calculation of joint distribution function of advanced and retarded green s functions of hamiltonian eq.(1 ) is developed .",
    "\\2 . for the binary disordered one dimensional system , described by hamiltonian ( 1 ) with the atomic splittings @xmath7 being equal to zero with probability @xmath27 and equal to @xmath3 with probability @xmath28 ( @xmath29 )",
    "the following expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath25 function are obtained : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 nonanalyticity with respect to @xmath3 is related to the occurrence ( when @xmath33 ) of the edge state with eigen energy @xmath34 .",
    "\\3 . for the wide class of disordered systems described by hamiltonian ( 1 ) with random atomic splittings @xmath7",
    "having the distribution functions in the form @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 ) the following expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath25 function are obtained : @xmath37    all the results obtained in the paper were verified by the computer simulation which shows that when @xmath38 the deviation of formulas eq.(4  6 ) from the numerical results is less than @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the degree of disorder may be rather large .",
    "for example formula eq.(6 ) is still valid when @xmath7 values are uniformly distributed within the interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to show that the quantity @xmath41 ( with the quantity of interest @xmath42 ) can be calculated as :    @xmath43\\langle\\gamma(u_1-\\imath v_1)\\gamma(u_2+\\imath v_2)\\rangle\\ ] ]    where @xmath44  is the edge green s function ( egf ) for hamiltonian eq.(1 ) :    @xmath45    to calculate the mean product of two green s functions entering eq.(7 ) one should know their joint distribution function .",
    "we obtain the equation for this function by generalising the dyson s method @xcite .",
    "let s denote by @xmath46 the edge green s functions eq.(8 ) with complex energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 and add one more atom with splitting @xmath3 to the chain .",
    "then as it is shown in @xcite egf of the chain with added atom @xmath49 can be expressed in terms of egf of the initial chain as :    @xmath50    to describe the egfs of the initial chain @xmath46 we introduce the distribution function @xmath51 defined in such a way that the quantity @xmath52 gives the probability of re@xmath53 $ ] and im@xmath54 , i=1,2 $ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath55 the analagous function for the chain with added atom .",
    "the relation eq.(9 ) allows one to express @xmath55 in terms of @xmath51 and the distribution function of atomic splittings @xmath56 :    @xmath57    @xmath58 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath9 it must be @xmath59 . calculating the integrals with @xmath60-functions in eq.(10 )",
    "we obtain for the steady state function @xmath51 the following equation :    @xmath61    @xmath62    using the function @xmath51 one can introduce the mean product of the advanced and retarded green s functions entering eq.(7 ) as a sum of four terms :    @xmath63 dx_1dx_2dy_1dy_2\\equiv\\ ] ]    @xmath64    using the expression eq.(8 ) it is easy to see that these terms can be written in the representation of hamiltonian eq.(1 ) as :    @xmath65[(u_2-e_{\\lambda'})^2+v_2 ^ 2]}\\bigg\\rangle\\ ] ]    @xmath66[(u_2-e_{\\lambda'})^2+v_2 ^ 2]}\\bigg\\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath67[(u_2-e_{\\lambda'})^2+v_2 ^ 2 ] } \\bigg\\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath68[(u_2-e_{\\lambda'})^2+v_2 ^ 2 ] } \\bigg\\rangle\\ ] ]    thus , @xmath41 eq.(7 ) can be represented as a sum of four contributions :    @xmath69    we present the calculation of @xmath70 as an example :    @xmath71    @xmath72[(u_2-e_{\\lambda'})^2+v_2 ^ 2]}\\bigg\\rangle=\\ ] ] latexmath:[\\[={1\\over 4}\\bigg\\langle\\sum_{\\lambda\\lambda ' }     the similar calculations shows that all four contributions eq.(14 ) to @xmath41 are equal to each other : @xmath74 and therefore :    @xmath75    the following remark is important for what is hearafter .",
    "suppose that the integration over @xmath76 in eq.(15 ) runs over the small region @xmath77 $ ] only and we are interested in the behaviour of @xmath78 contribution at @xmath0 .",
    "in this case the sum in the last string of eq.(15 ) will contain the states with energies @xmath79 $ ] only .",
    "so , it is seen that such restriction of the integration region allows one to calculate the `` participation '' function eq.(3 ) .",
    "thus , the problem reduced to solving of the eq.(11 ) for the joint probability distribution function @xmath51 . the fact that when calculating the contributions eq.(13 ) the limit @xmath80 is implied one can use for reducing the problem to studying the equation which is much easier than eq.(11 ) . to do this",
    "we note that if @xmath81 then the solution of eq.(11 ) can be presented in the form :    @xmath82    where the depending on @xmath76 function @xmath83 satisfy the following equation :    @xmath84    now let us perform the calculation of the quantity @xmath85 taking into account that for small @xmath86 the solution of eq.(11 ) goes to eq.(17 ) .",
    "using the fact that the function @xmath51 is satisfy to eq.(11 ) one can write the following expression for the mean of interest @xmath85 :    @xmath87    @xmath88 by replacing the variables :    @xmath89    and calculating the corresponding jacobians one can continue the equality eq.(19 ) as : @xmath90    taking advantage of the fact that when @xmath80 the function @xmath51 is close to eq.(17 ) one can conclude that in the region where the expression under this integral is essentially differs from zero the following estimations are valid : @xmath91 , with the accuracy of estimations increasing in the limit @xmath80 . in this limit @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . having all this in mind one can now perform the integration over @xmath94 ,",
    "replace the function @xmath51 by its ultimate expression eq.(17 ) and finally get :    @xmath95    here we imply the main value of the integral .",
    "the same calculations can be performed for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    in the end",
    "one should take into account the following important remark .",
    "it is seen from the eq.(15 ) that if @xmath85 has no singularity at @xmath99 then @xmath100 .",
    "therefore the non - zero value of @xmath1 is related to the occuarence of the singularity of @xmath85 at @xmath101 .",
    "thus , for calculation of @xmath1 it is sufficient to solve the eq.(18 ) for small @xmath102 , extract the singular part and use it for the calculation of ultimate at @xmath0 behaviour of the integral in eq.(15 ) .",
    "this will be done in the next sections",
    "in the case of binary disorder mentioned in the first section the distribution function of atomic levels splittings has the form :    @xmath103    and eq.(18 ) can be written as : @xmath104 we now introduce the function @xmath105 as a series in powers of @xmath28 : @xmath106 by substituting this series into eq.(23 ) and equating the coefficients at equal powers of @xmath28 one can obtain : @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 to calculate the value of @xmath1 up to the terms of @xmath110 it is sufficient to calculate the mean eq.(21 ) with the same accuracy . by substituting eq.(22 ) and eq.(24 ) to eq.(21 ) we obtain : @xmath111 the first term in braces gives the mean @xmath85 ( up to the factor @xmath27 ) for the _ completely ordered _ chain ( when @xmath112 ) and is not of interest for us .",
    "thus , for the singular part of @xmath85 ( we denote it as `` sing '' ) which we are interested in and for the ultimate at @xmath0 value of @xmath70 we obtain the following expressions : @xmath113    @xmath114 to obtain the functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 entering eq.(28 ) one should solve the equations eq.(25 ) and eq.(26 ) .",
    "we start the analysis of these equations from the most important case when @xmath117 , i.e. when energies of both green s functions are belong to the spectrum of bare hamiltonian eq.(1 ) at @xmath118 .      by direct substitution",
    "one can see that in this case the exact solution of eq.(25 ) can be written in the close form : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is lorentzian : @xmath121 let us turn now to the eq.(26 ) whose solution for @xmath117 we will construct using the system of special functions proposed by the author in @xcite .",
    "below we briefly review the results obtained in @xcite .    define the depending on parameter @xmath122 linear operator @xmath123 which acts on an arbitrary function in accordance with the following definition : @xmath124 as it is shown in @xcite the eigen functions @xmath125 and",
    "eigen numbers @xmath126 ( they can be numbered by integer @xmath127 ) are defined by the following relations : @xmath128^n\\equiv { \\cal l}_u(x)g^n(x ) , \\hskip3 mm \\lambda_n=\\bigg({u+\\imath\\sqrt{4-u^2}\\over u-\\imath\\sqrt{4-u^2}}\\bigg)^n , \\hskip3 mm |\\lambda_n|=1\\ ] ] where @xmath129 the map corresponding to operator @xmath123 plays an important role in eqs .",
    "( 25 ) , ( 26 ) and for this reason we will search for the solution of these equations in the form of the expansion into a set of functions eq.(32 ) .",
    "to do this we use the rules of expansion of an arbitrary function @xmath130 in a set of functions eq.(32 ) obtained in @xcite : @xmath131 with coefficients @xmath132 being defined by formulas : @xmath133 using the functions eq.(32 ) one can expand @xmath134 in series : @xmath135 substituting the series eq.(35 ) into eq.(26 ) and making use of the properties of functions eq.(32 ) one can obtain : @xmath136=\\ ] ] @xmath137 with the help of eq.(33 ) and eq.(34 ) one can expand the r.h.p . of this equation in a set of functions eq.(32 ) and obtain the following expressions for the expansion coefficients of @xmath116 : @xmath138 where functions @xmath139 are defined as : @xmath140 the following ( based on the properties of @xmath125 functions ) relations are take place : latexmath:[\\[j_n(u,0)=0\\hskip5mm\\hbox{for}\\hskip2 mm n\\ne 0,\\hskip5 mm j_n(u,\\varepsilon)=j_{-n}^\\ast(u,\\varepsilon)\\rightarrow    solution of eq.(26 ) for @xmath116 has the form : @xmath142 as it was mentioned above only singular at @xmath143 part of this expression is needed for calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "it easy to see that only terms with @xmath144 of sum eq.(40 ) possess the required peculiarity at @xmath101 .",
    "now we make the following replacing of symbols : @xmath145 and write down the expression for the denominators of these terms up to @xmath146 : @xmath147 taking this into account we obtain the following expression for the singular part of eq.(40 ) : @xmath148 let us turn now to the eq.(28 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the first item under integral do not contribute to the final result when @xmath117 due to the regularity of function @xmath115 eq.(29 ) at @xmath101 .",
    "for this reason only the second item ( it depends on function @xmath116 ) remain to be considered : @xmath149 @xmath150 when evaluating the expression under integral we make the following replacing of variable @xmath151 and make use of the fact that the functions @xmath125 are eigen for the operator @xmath123 eq.(31 ) .",

    "it is shown in the appendix that the second item in braces in eq.(28 ) ( depending on @xmath116 ) do not contribute to the final result .",

    "_ consequently the contribution under consideration is differ from zero only when @xmath168 . _ the function under integral in eq.(51 ) has a @xmath60-peculiarity with respect to @xmath169 and a pole - peculiarity with respect to @xmath170 to calculate these integrals ( at @xmath171 ) we take into account the following property of the relevant function @xmath172 defined as : @xmath173 this function is equal to zero at : @xmath174 and can be expanded at @xmath175 as : @xmath176 using this formula one can perform the integration over @xmath169 in eq.(51 ) : @xmath177 \\delta\\bigg [ { u_2+\\sqrt{u_2 ^ 2 - 4}\\over 2}-\\varepsilon \\bigg]={\\varepsilon^2 - 1\\over\\varepsilon^2}\\exp[-\\imath u_0t]\\ ] ] let us now turn to the integration over @xmath170 in eq.(51 ) . due to the fact that one should calculate this integral at @xmath0 the contribution of pole - peculiarity is the only one of importance . using the expansion eq.(54 )",

    "@xmath1 one should sum the contributions eq.(57 ) and eq.(48 ) and in accordance with eq.(16 ) multiply the result by four .",

    "one can see that the `` participation '' function @xmath25 eq.(3 ) is define by eq.(5 ) .",
    "the analysis of the binary disordered chain presented above can be regarded as a consistent perturbation theory for the statistics of advanced and retarded green s functions with concentration @xmath28 of atoms with the level splitting @xmath3 playing the role of small parameter .",
    "the perturbation theory for the case of the chain with an arbitrary small diagonal disorder can be constructed in a similar way .",
    "the relevant small parameter can be defined as follows .",
