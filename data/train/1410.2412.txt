    "in 1918 weyl proposed a new geometry to unify electromagnetism with einstein s general relativity @xcite . in riemannian geometry",
    "one has a priori condition that the length of a vector should not change during the parallel transportation . in the weyl geometry , this assumption is dropped and so a parallel transported vector has different length and direction with respect to the original vector . the gravitational theory which is built on the weyl geometry",
    "is known as the einstein - weyl gravity @xcite . in einstein - weyl gravity",
    "the connection is no longer metric compatible , so , the covariant derivative of the metric is not zero .",
    "instead one has the relation @xmath1 where the tensor @xmath2 is symmetric with respect to its last two indices .",
    "weyl proposed the special case @xmath3 for his theory where @xmath4 is the weyl vector .",
    "one of the important consequences of this geometry is that the unit vector changes through parallel transportation .",
    "suppose that the length of an arbitrary vector field @xmath5 is @xmath6 . during the parallel transportation ,",
    "the variation of the length of @xmath5 can be written in terms of the weyl vector as @xmath7 for a closed curve , the length of the vector @xmath5 changes as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the area of the closed curve , @xmath10 is the infinitesimal element of the surface , and @xmath11 is called the weyl s length curvature which is the same as the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "this implies that one has the freedom to choose the unit length at each point , which is the weyl gauge freedom @xcite .",
    "a variety of works have been done in the weyl geometry including the cosmology @xcite , relations to scalar - tensor @xcite and teleparallel theories @xcite .",
    "one can also restrict the form of weyl vector to be a derivative of a scalar as @xmath12 @xcite . in this case",
    "the length curvature @xmath13 vanishes and one can then define a fixed unit length at each point .",
    "we note that the unit length varies at different points .",
    "the resulting theory is known as the weyl integrable theory @xcite .",
    "another generalization of einstein gravity can be proposed by assuming the existence of an asymmetric connection on the space - time manifold .",
    "the first attempt for this purpose is due to eddington in 1921 in order to generalize the einstein s general relativity to get some insights about microscopic physics @xcite .",
    "the major attempt in this way was done by cartan in 1922 where he defined the torsion tensor as the antisymmetric part of the general connection @xcite . the theory based on this assumption",
    "is called the einstein - cartan theory .",
    "cartan believed that the torsion tensor should be related in some way to the intrinsic angular momentum of the matter content of the universe .",
    "so , the torsion should vanish in the absence of matter @xcite .",
    "however , this idea had been forgotten for a while .",
    "the concept of the asymmetric affine connection came back to the literature as a way to write a unified field theory of general relativistic type @xcite .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of a spinning massive particle was known to be asymmetric @xcite .",
    "it was clear that these particles can not be a source of einstein s general relativity equation . in order to consider these particles in the context of general relativity",
    ", one should generalize the einstein s equation to a theory with asymmetric energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the concept of torsion , can then be used as a way to consider these type of particles @xcite .",
    "many works have been done in the context of theories with torsion , including teleparallel theories @xcite , and weyl - cartan theories @xcite . for a very good review on the subject of cartan theory ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there is another way to generalize the einstein s general relativity , by replacing the ricci scalar with a general function of it , known as @xmath14 gravity theories @xcite .",
    "but one can add to the action , any scalar combination of the riemann tensor and its contractions .",
    "one of the first attempts was done by kretschmann @xcite in 1917 by introducing the action of the form @xmath15 instead of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the above action has higher than second order time derivatives of the metric in its field equation and hence contains ghost instabilities .",
    "it turns out that the unique combination of two riemann tensors and its contractions which leads to at most second order time derivatives in the field equation is of the form @xmath16 which is called the gauss - bonnet term . in four space - time dimensions",
    ", this term can be written as a total derivative , and can be dropped from the field equations @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that in 4d , the riemannian geometry together with the condition of stability has a unique candidate for the gravitational action , which is the einstein - hilbert action .    in non - riemannian geometries such as weyl and cartan geometries",
    ", the above conclusion is no longer true and the gauss - bonnet term will not become total derivative . in @xcite",
    "the gauss - bonnet combination was obtained in the context of weyl geometry , and it turns out that the remaining term in 4d is the weyl vector kinetic term @xmath17 it is the aim of the present paper to generalize the above argument to the case of weyl - cartan space - time .",
    "similar to the einstein - weyl space - time , in the weyl - cartan space - time the gauss - bonnet term will not be a total derivative .",
    "the theory is not in general ostrogradski stable . in order to have a stable theory one should constrain the parameter space of the model as we will do in the following sections .",
    "the weyl - cartan model has also been considered in the context of weitzenboch gravity in @xcite .",
    "the authors have added the kinetic terms for the weyl vector and the torsion tensor by hand , using the trace of torsion tensor .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to see if adding higher order gravity terms in lagrangian can show a way to have kinetic terms automatically .",
    "for this case we will just add the gauss - bonnet term which we know does not produce any ghost for the metric perturbations .",
    "adding non - metricity as well as torsion has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the author has shown that at the second order gravity level , connection has no dynamics which is same as the results in @xcite .",
    "higher order curvature terms in the presence of torsion ( without non - metricity ) has been studied in @xcite where the authors have shown that chiral fermionic matter fields can live in a riemann - cartan geometry . particularly , the lovelock theory in the presence of the torsion has been studied in the @xmath18-dimensions @xcite and in the context of stringy fluxes @xcite .    before going ahead",
    "let us briefly say our approach .",
    "in general , we are working in the context of effective field theory .",
    "however there are two ( equivalent ) approaches which are extensively studied , for example , in the context of inflation . in the first approach",
    "@xcite all the possible perturbations have been assumed at the level of the lagrangian with arbitrary coefficients .",
    "the equivalent alternative approach is to assume the possible terms at the level of background @xcite . here",
    "we will do more or less the same approach as in @xcite .",
    "we first assume we have just a metric and try to have all the consistent possible terms at the level of the lagrangian which is ricci scalar and gauss - bonnet ( in general lovelock terms ) .",
    "then we ask what happens to this model if one assume non - metricity and torsion .",
    "the other approach , which is more similar to @xcite , is to write all the possible terms constructed by non - metricity and torsion in addition to the metric itself .",
    "this second approach was done in @xcite .",
    "we will see in this paper that considering the gauss - bonnet action can produce automatically all the kinetic terms of @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the theory @xcite has a potential ghost , noting that in the weitzenboch gravity the torsion has some relation to the ricci scalar , and as a result the torsion kinetic term has more than second time derivatives .",
    "however , the present paper is free from the aforementioned instability due to the absence of the weitzenboch condition .",
    "one should note that the torsion self - interaction term @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in @xcite can not be produced in the present context , because it is fourth order in the torsion and second order in derivatives . in order to produce such term one should consider the higher order lovelock terms in the action .",
    "the present theory in general may have some tachyon instabilities but the analysis is very complicated because of the appearance of the torsion tensor . in section [ sec1 ] the generalized gauss - bonnet action in weyl - cartan space - time is introduced and shown that the higher than two time derivatives are removed in the action . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we will consider a restricted form for the torsion tensor and obtain the healthy region of the parameter space in which tachyonic instabilities are removed .",
    "the weyl geometry proposal induces a new vector which results in non - metricity of the connection i.e. @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the covariant derivative with respect to the weyl connection .",
    "mathematically , the weyl geometry has a special form of non - metricity i.e. @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the weyl vector .",
    "so the weyl connection can be obtained as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the christoffel symbol .",
    "in addition one may generalize the above connection by adding the effects of the torsion into it as @xmath29 note that the third term is named contortion tensor defined as @xmath30 where we have defined the torsion tensor @xmath31 as @xmath32 it is easy to show that the additional torsion does not affect the non - metricity relation i.e. the relation ( [ mo1 ] ) is still valid . by using the metric one can build @xmath33 which is antisymmetric with respect to its two first indices by having in mind that the torsion tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its lower indices in @xmath34 .",
    "we define the curvature tensor as @xmath35 one can decompose the curvature tensor into four parts as @xmath36 where the first term in the right hand side of the above relation is the riemann curvature tensor defined by the christoffel symbol and we have defined @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the covariant derivative with respect to the christoffel symbol and @xmath39 represents interaction between non - metricity and torsion parts . it is possible to rewrite the purely non - metricity part as @xmath40 } -\\delta^\\lambda_{[\\sigma}\\nabla_{\\nu]}w_\\mu -g_{\\mu[\\nu}\\nabla_{\\sigma]}w^\\lambda+\\delta^\\lambda_{[\\nu}w_{\\sigma]}w_\\mu+g_{\\mu[\\nu}\\delta^\\lambda_{\\sigma]}w^2 + g_{\\mu[\\sigma}w_{\\nu]}w^\\lambda,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and the interaction part as @xmath42 } -w^\\alpha c^\\lambda_{~\\alpha[\\sigma}g_{\\nu]\\mu}-w^\\lambda   c_{\\mu[\\nu\\sigma]}-w_\\mu c^\\lambda_{~[\\sigma\\nu]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the curvature tensor @xmath43 is still antisymmetric wrt its last two indices .    in order to construct a higher order gravity models e.g. gauss - bonnet action",
    ", one should multiply the curvature tensor to itself .",
    "there are seven different ways to do this @xmath44 one should note that in the case of vanishing weyl and torsion , only the first three terms of equation can be reduced to @xmath45 which is present in the standard gauss - bonnet lagrangian . adding the rest of these combinations to the lagrangian will produce higher than second order time derivatives of the metric which makes our theory unstable .",
    "so , we will ignore them in the following and only add the first three terms to the action .",
    "now consider the contractions of different parts of the curvature tensor .",
    "it is well - known that the riemann tensor has only one independent contraction .",
    "the weyl part of the above curvature tensor has two independent contractions @xmath46 where we have defined @xmath47 the contortion part of the curvature tensor has only one independent contraction @xmath48 where we have defined @xmath49 .",
    "the interaction part has also one independent contraction which can be written as @xmath50 for the riemann curvature tensor , we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the standard ricci tensor . for the contracted curvature tensor ,",
    "the two independent contractions are @xmath54 there are four independent combinations of them as follows @xmath55 in the case of vanishing weyl and torsion , the first two terms of equation vanishes , and the rest becomes identical to @xmath56 .",
    "there is only one independent curvature scalar of the tensor @xmath57",
    "which can be defined by contracting the tensor @xmath58 with the metric @xmath59    let us propose the following action @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the gauss - bonnet action defined as @xmath62,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are arbitrary constants . to get the standard gauss - bonnet action in the absence of torsion and non - metricity we need to impose the following constraints on the coefficients    [ 14 ] @xmath65    the coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 does not enter to the above conditions , because in the case of vanishing weyl vector , the tensor @xmath68 vanishes .",
    "we should note that the above action is the most general action for the second order higher gravity in the weyl - cartan theory which reduces to the standard gauss - bonnet action in the limit of zero weyl and torsion .",
    "the potentially dangerous terms which can produce ostrogradski ghost can be written as    @xmath69r_{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla^\\mu   w^\\nu\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\big[3 - 2(\\beta_1+\\beta_2)\\big]r\\nabla^\\mu   w_\\mu-2(\\beta_1+\\beta_2)r_{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla^\\alpha   c_{\\alpha}^{~~\\mu\\nu}+(\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3)r_{\\alpha\\delta\\beta\\gamma } \\nabla^\\alpha   c^{\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\bigg).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using equations , one can write the rhs of as @xmath70 the first term of the above action does not contribute to the theory after integrating by part and using the contracted bianchi identity .",
    "also , by using the first bianchi identity and integrating by part , one can easily show that @xmath71 using the above equation , one can see that the last two terms in cancel each other .",
    "so , the potentially dangerous terms , do not contribute to the full action .    in order to write the action @xmath61 in detail",
    ", we decompose the action into three parts .",
    "the terms which involve only the weyl vector can be collected as @xmath72 with @xmath73 and we have dropped the total derivative terms .",
    "the terms which involves the contortion tensor can be written as    @xmath74,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined @xmath75 and @xmath76 one should note that the tensor @xmath77 is proportional to the tensor @xmath78 constructed similarly with the torsion tensor .",
    "one can see that the term @xmath79 is produced naturally in this model , which is also the kinetic term assumed in @xcite .",
    "the remaining terms of the action contain a variety of possible interactions between the weyl vector and the contortion tensor    @xmath80.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is worth mentioning that the term @xmath81 contains an interaction term between weyl vector and torsion tensor which was assumed in @xcite .",
    "finally , the full action of the theory can be written as @xmath82+s_w+s_c+s_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us discuss about the coupling of the ordinary matter field to our theory .",
    "note that we have 3 independent field in the theory .",
    "the metric tensor couples to the energy - momentum tensor of the matter and responsible for the gravitational force .",
    "the torsion tensor should be coupled to the spin tensor of the matter @xcite . due to the works of weyl to unify the electromagnetic field with gravity @xcite",
    ", one can imagine that the weyl vector can be coupled to the electric current of the matter . in this sense",
    ", one can add the matter lagrangian of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 present the matter fields . by varying the matter",
    "the metric one can obtain the energy - momentum tensor of the ordinary matter as @xmath85 variation of @xmath86 wrt the torsion is the spin tensor @xmath87 in the special case where the matter field can be described by a scalar field , the spin tensor is zero and the torsion equation of motion is source - free . in other cases , one can define the spin tensor of the matter field from noether s theorem and use it as a source of the torsion equation of motion .",
    "the variation of @xmath86 wrt the weyl vector is @xmath88 which can be considered as an electric current of ordinary matter . in the case of uncharged matter field",
    "the current @xmath89 will become zero and the weyl equation of motion will become source - free .",
    "in the following we will assume that the matter lagrangian vanishes for simplicity .",
    "the effect of matter fields and the interaction of torsion tensor and weyl vector with it will be postponed to future works .",
    "the torsion tensor can be decomposed irreducibly into @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are two vector fields .",
    "the vector @xmath91 is actually the trace of torsion over its first and third indices .",
    "the tensor @xmath93 is symmetric with respect to @xmath94 and @xmath95 and has the following properties @xmath96 one can decompose the contortion tensor according to the above relation as @xmath97    let us assume that the contortion tensor has the following simple form @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the action can then be expanded as @xmath102.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , the above action may have some ghost and or tachyon instabilities . in order to examine this issue ,",
    "we first diagonalize the kinetic and potential terms for @xmath103 and @xmath4 with the result @xmath104,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are strength tensors respectively according to vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 which will be defined below .",
    "as one can see from the above action , the theory contains one massless and one massive vector fields with mass @xmath109 where we have defined    @xmath110    the new fileds can be related to the original fields @xmath103 and @xmath4 as @xmath111 , \\label{55}\\\\ & y_\\mu=-{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\beta^2 - 1}}}\\bigg[(\\beta\\lambda_{-}\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^2 } + \\alpha\\lambda _ { + } \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - 1})\\hat{q}_\\mu-(\\alpha\\beta\\lambda_{-}-\\lambda_{+}\\sqrt { ( 1-\\alpha^2)(\\beta^2 - 1)})w_\\mu\\bigg],\\label{552}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112^{{\\frac{1 } { 2 } } } , \\\\ & \\beta=-\\left[{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left({\\frac{(a+2b+c)\\sqrt{4b^2+(a - c)^2}}{4b^2+(a - c)^2 + 2b(a + c ) } } + 1\\right)\\right]^{{\\frac{1}{2}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath113 in order to have a ghost and tachyon free theory we should have @xmath114 and the new fields and should be meaningful . we thus conclude that the parameters @xmath115 and @xmath67 should satisfy the relations @xmath116 together with reality of square roots .",
    "the action can be seen as a gravitational theory minimally coupled to a proca field and a maxwell field , i.e. the einstein - maxwell - proca theory .",
    "geometrization of the einstein - proca ( ep ) action was done before with different approaches . in @xcite ,",
    "the ep action was obtained by writing the gauss - bonnet action in the weyl space - time . however , in the weyl space - time , adding the contraction of the antisymmetric part of the ricci tensor with the ricci tensor itself , is sufficient to produce the ep action , which was done in @xcite .",
    "one can also obtain the ep action by writing the @xmath117 action in the palatini formalism @xcite . in this case",
    "the equation of motion for the connection can be solved for the connection itself , leading to an expression which is equivalent to the weyl connection with the weyl vector @xmath118 where prime is taking derivative with respect to the function s argument .",
    "the connection of this theory and the resulting ricci tensor is asymmetric .",
    "the antisymmetric part of the ricci tensor can then produce a kinetic term for the weyl vector @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we have used the weyl - cartan space - time for writing the gauss - bonnet action . in the special case",
    "where only the trace part of the torsion tensor is non - vanishing , the theory reduces to a bi - vector - tensor theory , which can not be obtained in the weyl space - time . note that writing the gauss - bonnet action in the cartan space - time and keeping only the trace part of the torsion will produce the ep action . ]    the theory presented here can be seen as a gravitational theory coupled to two vector galileon fields @xcite . because we have added only a gauss - bonnet term ( which is the second lovelock term ) to the action",
    ", only the second vector galileon term appears .",
    "one may expect that adding higher order lovelock terms to the action may produce higher order vector galileon terms .",
    "term in the decomposition of torsion can produce vector galileon term because of the appearance of levi - civita tensor .",
    "this possibility will be considered in a separate work .",
    "] one should note that in the vector galileon theories , the helicity-0 part plays the role of galileon fields @xcite .",
    "galileons are some scalar fields which has higher than second order time derivatives in the action , but produce at most second order field equations .",
    "the resulting action is known as the horndeski action @xcite .",
    "note that in the action the helicity-0 part vanishes due to the special form of the kinetic term .",
    "however , considering the theory in higher dimensions and then performing the kaluza - klein reduction , one can obtain the horndeski theory @xcite .",
    "our theory can be seen as a generalization of the horndeski action , in the sense that we have also added some higher order curvature tensor terms to the action .",
    "however , we have used the gauss - bonnet combination which causes that the action has no higher than second order time derivatives .",
    "conditions can be solved analytically in terms of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the solution implies that @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the parameter space is divided into three parts as follows @xmath123 solving the above conditions in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is very difficult to obtain .",
    "so , in the following we will study some special cases .      in this case",
    "the the action @xmath61 reduces to @xmath126,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the constraints satisfy if @xmath127      in this case the the action @xmath61 reduces to @xmath130,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the constraints satisfy if @xmath131      in this case the the action @xmath61 reduces to @xmath133,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + [ fig12 ]    in the figure we have plotted the allowed region of parameter space ( @xmath134,@xmath67 ) in order to have a ghost and tachyon free bi - vector theory .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a ghost free modified theory of gravity by generalizing the geometry to be the weyl - cartan space - time . using the standard einstein - hilbert term for this geometry",
    ", the action reduces to the ricci scalar , plus possible mass terms for weyl vector and the torsion tensor . in this case , kinetic terms for these two new fields are not produced . in order to make the weyl vector and the torsion tensor dynamical",
    ", one can add some kinetic terms by hand , which was done in @xcite .    in this paper , in order to produce kinetic terms for the weyl and torsion fields",
    ", we have generalized the action to be of gauss - bonnet type . in 4d riemannian geometry",
    "the gauss - bonnet term becomes a total derivative and dropped from the action .",
    "however in the weyl - cartan geometry , this term produces a bunch of interaction and kinetic terms for weyl and torsion fields . in the weyl - cartan geometry",
    "the curvature tensor has less symmetries than the riemann tensor .",
    "so one can write more than three quadratic terms according to the curvature",
    ". in general , the resulting action does not reduce to the standard gauss - bonnet action .",
    "however , demanding that the action should reduce to the standard gauss - bonnet action in the case of vanishing weyl and cartan , all the higher than two time derivatives of the action becomes a total derivative and do not contribute to the action .    for further considerations",
    ", we have studied a special case of the theory where only the trace part of the torsion tensor is non - zero . in this case , the theory is reduced to general relativity plus one massive and one massless vector fields .",
    "this theory can be seen as an einstein - maxwell - proca system which has 7 d.o.f .",
    ", two for the graviton , two of the maxwell field and three for the proca vector field .",
    "the einstein - proca system was also geometrized in the context of weyl gravity in @xcite and also in the context of palatini - f(r ) theories @xcite . however , our theory in its reduced form where we have considered in section [ sec2 ] , has two vector fields minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "one can see that the trace of the torsion tensor can also play the role of a proca field",
    ".    it will be very interesting to note that , in order to obtain a kinetic term for a vector field by adding higher order curvature terms to the action , the ricci tensor should be asymmetric .",
    "in weyl space - time considered in @xcite and also in the weyl - cartan space - time considered here , the ricci tensor is asymmetric . in @xcite ,",
    "the palatini assumption is sufficient to take the connection asymmetric , and as a result the ricci tensor will be asymmetric .    in this paper",
    "we showed that the absence of ostrogradski ghost reduces the dimension of parameter space of the theory to 5 .",
    "however , this will not prove that the theory is healthy . the full theory may has some boulware - deser ghosts or tachyonic instabilities . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we have considered some special cases of the theory and obtained the healthy region of the parameter space of the theory .",
    "it is worth mentioning that higher order lovelock terms can also contribute to the action in 4d in the context of weyl - cartan theory . in this paper",
    "we have only studied the second order term to show that the formalism is capable of producing kinetic terms for weyl vector and torsion tensor .",
    "higher order terms can be responsible for higher order self - interaction terms for the weyl and torsion which may resembles vector galileons and its generalizations .",
    "this issue should be considered carefully in more details which should be studied in a separate work .",
    "a question which should be answered in future works is about physics of our model .",
    "this can be done by solving for both cosmological and static solutions at the level of background to see if self - accelerating solutions exists and the solar system tests are satisfied .",
    "the other issue is coupling to matter which definitely affects predictions of our model which is beyond the scope of current work .",
