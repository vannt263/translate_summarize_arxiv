    "our starting point is kannan s result in metric fixed point theory involving contractive type mappings which are not necessarily continuous @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that kannan s theorem is independent of the famous banach contraction principle ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , and that it also characterizes the metric completeness concept @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a metric space .",
    "let us call @xmath1 a _ kannan map _ if there exists some @xmath2 such that @xmath3 for all @xmath4 .    for complete metric spaces , kannan proved the following :    ( @xcite)[thm : if  is ] if @xmath0 is a complete metric space , and if @xmath5 is a kannan map on @xmath6 , then there exists a unique @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .    and",
    "subrahmanyam ( in @xcite ) has proved the counterpart by showing that if all the kannan maps on a metric space have fixed points then that space must necessarily be complete .",
    "as in @xcite , from this point onwards let @xmath0 stand for a complete metric space .",
    "let us select arbitrarily a point @xmath9 , and call it the `` zero '' of @xmath6 .",
    "we denote @xmath10 let @xmath11 $ ] be fixed constants , and let @xmath12\\rightarrow[0,\\,\\infty)$ ] denote a preassigned increasing function that vanishes ( with continuity ) at zero .",
    "then , for a map @xmath1 , pata shows that the following theorem holds .",
    "( @xcite)[thm : pata ] if the inequality @xmath13^{\\beta}\\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] is satisfied for every @xmath14 $ ] and every @xmath15 then @xmath5 possesses a unique fixed point @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .    motivated by this generalization of the banach fixed point theorem ,",
    "we can come up with an analogous generalized form of theorem [ thm : if  is ] .      with all the other conditions and notations remaining the same except for a more general @xmath18 , our goal is to prove the following :    [ thm :",
    "if - the - inequality]if the inequality @xmath19^{\\beta}\\label{eq : b}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] is satisfied @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 , then @xmath5 possesses a unique fixed point @xmath22    since we can always redefine @xmath23 to keep ( [ eq : b ] ) valid no matter what initial @xmath9 we choose , we are in no way restricting ourselves by taking that zero instead of a generic @xmath7 @xcite",
    ".        we claim first that such an @xmath24 , if it exists , is unique . to see that this is the case ,",
    "let , if possible , @xmath25 such that @xmath26 then ( [ eq : b ] ) implies , @xmath20,$ ] @xmath27^{\\beta}.\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath28 gives us @xmath29 which is a contradiction .",
    "we now bring into play the two sequences @xmath30 but before we proceed any further , we will need the following :    [ lem :- is - bounded.]@xmath31 is bounded .    from ( [ eq : b ] ) ,",
    "considering again the case of @xmath32 we see that for @xmath33 , @xmath34    now , @xmath35 , @xmath36}\\\\   & \\leq d(tx_{n},\\ , tx_{0})+2c_{1}\\\\   & \\leq\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { d(x_{n+1},\\ , x_{n})+d(x_{1},\\ , x_{0})\\right\\ } + 2c_{1 } & \\textrm{[using ( \\ref{eq : b } ) with } \\varepsilon=0\\,\\textrm{]}\\\\   & \\leq\\frac{1}{2}(c_{1}+c_{1})+2c_{1 } & \\textrm{[(\\ref{eq : c})]}\\\\   & = 3c_{1}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence the lemma is proved .",
    "next we strive to show that :    [ lem :- is - cauchy.]@xmath37 is cauchy .    in light of ( [ eq : b ] ) , for @xmath33 , @xmath38^{\\beta}\\\\ & \\leq\\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{2}\\left\\ { d(x_{n+1},\\ , x_{n})+d(x_{n},\\ , x_{n-1})\\right\\ } + c\\varepsilon^{\\alpha}\\psi(\\varepsilon)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath39 ( on account of lemma [ lem :- is - bounded . ] ) .",

    "finally , all that remains to show is that :      for this we observe that , @xmath65 @xmath66}\\nonumber \\\\ & \\implies\\frac{1}{2}d(tx^{*},\\ , x^{*})\\leq\\frac{1}{2}d(x_{n},\\ , x_{n+1})+d(x_{n+1},\\ , x^{*})\\label{eq : f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath60 ( and @xmath67 ) , we know that : @xmath68;}\\\\ & d(x_{n+1},\\ , x^{*})\\rightarrow0 & \\textrm{[since } x_{n}\\rightarrow x^{*}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so ( [ eq : f ] ) actually gives us that @xmath69 which is the required result .",
    "the requirements of theorem [ thm : if - the - inequality ] are indeed weaker than those of kannan s theorem . to see that ,",
    "let us start from ( [ eq : a ] ) with @xmath70 ( barring the trivial case where @xmath71 ) .",
