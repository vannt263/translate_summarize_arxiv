    "the interplay between disorder and interactions in bose systems has been a vital field of research in condensed matter both in theory and experiment .",
    "the line of investigation was mainly initiated by the seminal work of fisher et al.@xcite , who first provided a detailed study of localization of interacting bosons in a random potential , which led to the notion of the superfluid - insulator transition and the bose glass ( bg ) .",
    "while disorder effects in fermi systems are relevant to a broad range of experimentally accessible scenarios like correlated electron systems , the status was less diverse for bose systems for a considerable time period , as superfluid @xmath0he situated in random pores of vycor had been the predominant setup which could be studies with sufficient precision  @xcite .",
    "this changed dramatically when the realization of the superfluid - mott insulator transition of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice opened up a new field of investigation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , optical lattices provide a relatively pure and tunable simulation of effective models used to describe solid state systems@xcite , where effects like disorder can also be realized in a controlled manner .",
    "while several alternative realizations of disorder in optical lattices , such as multichromatic lattices with non - commensurate wavelengths@xcite or multi - species gases with strongly differing tunneling rates  @xcite have been proposed recently , speckle laser patterns are probably by now one of the most efficient methods to establish disorder in cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "therein , it is possible to combine the speckle beam with the remaining apparatus of the optical lattice to simulate disordered lattice systems with a high tuning accuracy and without other side effects .",
    "a variety of theoretical approaches  @xcite has by now been applied to the disordered bose hubbard model ( bhm ) , first introduced for ultracold atoms by jaksch et al .",
    "@xcite , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) annihilates ( creates ) a particle in the lowest band wannier state at site @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the local particle number operator , @xmath6 denotes the nearest neighbor hopping energy in the lowest band , and @xmath7 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath8 is an on - site energy shift , which in our case is a spatially uncorrelated random variable drawn from a distribution @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the on - site repulsive interaction .",
    "the subscript @xmath11 indicates the sum over all neighboring pairs of sites . unless stated otherwise , we use the unit @xmath12 .",
    "several quantum phases can exist within this model , such as the mott insulator ( mi ) , the bose glass , the condensed phase , commonly referred to as the superfluid ( sf ) , as well as the normal phase at finite temperature .",
    "the transitions between these phases , which constitute some of the first experimentally feasible quantum phase transitions in bosonic systems , have attracted much attention .",
    "numerically , a powerful approach is quantum monte carlo  @xcite ( qmc ) .",
    "while mi and sf phase can be characterized efficiently  @xcite , the bg phase and the vicinities of the transition lines are significantly more complicated to be adequately described .",
    "the main reason is that for finite size calculations in general , it is problematic to capture the correct description of the phase borders , which are essentially dominated by rare events , which is also a problem for qmc methods . in most cases ,",
    "exact diagonalization studies are simply inadequate due to limited size and number of particles , which often obscures essential physics ( however , there may appear aspects that can indeed be suitably captured by small clusters  @xcite ) . on the other hand , with a similar range of treatable system sizes as qmc , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) is an efficient complementary method  @xcite .",
    "however , dmrg is currently only applicable in one spatial dimension and thus does not allow for a description of effects in higher dimensional lattices .",
    "analytically , renormalization group analysis  @xcite , slave boson theory  @xcite , the strong coupling approach  @xcite , and various different kinds of mean field theory descendants have been applied to the bhm with and without disorder  @xcite .",
    "arithmetically averaged mean - field theories , on the other hand , are incapable of resolving the bg phase at all for @xmath13  @xcite , but also for @xmath14 impose an unphysically strong phase coherence , leading to an overestimation of the sf phase .",
    "other methods like the random phase approximation ( rpa ) which has successfully been applied to the system without disorder  @xcite again suffer from finite size effects for the bhm with disorder , as the absence of translational symmetry constrains its applicability to much smaller system sizes .    to circumvent this type of problems in describing the different phases of the disordered bhm",
    ", we use the smft which has been previously introduced and applied to the disordered bhm at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "there , it was found that the method efficiently describes localization , is both valid in high dimensions and in the thermodynamic limit , capturing rare events with their respective statistical weight and includes dimensional effects . in particular , it was found that at fixed @xmath7 , there exists a critical hopping strength , above which the system remains superfluid for arbitrarily strong disorder .    in this article , we present the smft in detail and investigate how the results found for the disordered bhm at zero temperature are modified at finite temperature .",
    "in addition to prototypical box disorder , we consider exponential speckle disorder to better simulate systems realized in current experiments . here , the results are qualitatively different in the sense that for any finite disorder strength the mi gives way to the bg .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , the smft is explained in detail . first the general scope is outlined , followed by the definition of quantities computed within smft , such as compressibility , local greens functions and condensate fraction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phases ] , the essential results for the disordered bhm at @xmath13 are given , followed by the extension of the smft calculations to @xmath15 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : box ] we extend the results presented for box disorder  @xcite , including finite temperature effects .",
    "alternative types of disorder , in particular disorder induced by speckle lasers are discussed for the bhm in sec .",
    "[ sec : speckle ] .",
    "as another possible source of disorder , we discuss the effect of kinetic ( hopping ) disorder in the bhm in sec .",
    "[ sec : hopping ] .",
    "however , we find no sensible dependence of the system on this parameter . the applicability of these results to current experiments essentially relies on the estimate of experimental temperature , which is discussed on in sec .",
    "[ sec : temp ] .",
    "we find that the experimentally realized temperatures are still far above the regime for which we resolve the previously stated interesting phenomena , such as disorder - induced condensation and reentrant behavior .",
    "lda + smft calculations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lda ] to provide a closer connection to experimentally measurable quantities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we conclude that the smft is an efficient theoretical approach to disordered bose systems and promises an adequate description of ongoing experiments .",
    "as pointed out previously@xcite , performing a self - consistent disorder average over all local on - site energies is not sufficient to generally describe the insulating bose - glass phase . from spatially resolved bosonic gutzwiller calculations",
    ", it becomes apparent that this method overestimates long range correlations , predicting the formation of a global condensate into a single particle orbital which consists of the superposition of a large ( extensive ) number of distinct localized single particle states . in the true bose glass phase ,",
    "off - diagonal long range order does not prevail and a large ( although not extensive ) number of particles may occupy each of these localized modes independently , leading to a condensate fraction @xmath16 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , by imposing phase rigidity and averaging over all mean - field parameters @xmath17 with the same complex phase , the spatially resolved ( as well as the arithmetically averaged ) gutzwiller theory leads to a finite average mean - field parameter ( mfp ) and a finite condensate fraction @xmath18 in the expected bg regime .",
    "in contrast to the approaches mentioned above , the smft is constructed as a single - site theory in the thermodynamic limit , which effectively describes fluctuations in the mfps using a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath19 . set up in this fashion , the smft method",
    "is not restricted to incorporating disorder fluctuations only , but may also be a powerful approach to treat fluctuations of different origins , such as of thermal or quantum type in a unified framework .",
    "the concept of approximating quantum mechanical operators by random variables has been applied previously in a variety of physical scenarios  @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on disorder - induced fluctuations at finite temperature . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the construction of smft in detail , concentrating on the case of including on - site disorder .",

    "it is assumed to be equal for all sites and in particular independent of the nearest neighbors on - site energies .",
    "the validity of this assumption has been checked using spatially resolved mean - field theory , which is known to become exact in the non - interacting limit , while retaining interaction effects beyond gross - pitaevskii theory for finite @xmath20 .",
    "it is found that it yields correlation coefficients below @xmath21 in all regimes considered@xcite , justifying the above assumption .",
    "the aim of smft is to find a self - consistent solution for @xmath19 , which is restricted and uniquely specified by self - consistency equations and minimization of energy .",
    "consider a cluster of lattice sites composed of a central site @xmath4 and @xmath22 ( the coordination number ) nearest neighbors , where the corresponding part of the hamiltonian   contains the operators on site @xmath4 within the bosonic gutzwiller approximation  @xcite : @xmath23 within this approximation , the site @xmath4 is coupled to ( and the sum extends over ) the nearest neighbors via the scalar mfps @xmath24 , which are random variables within smft .",
    "due to global particle number conservation , the mfps can all be chosen to be real and positive , as any variation in complex phase corresponds to a boost in local kinetic energy .",

[ sec : hopping ] also @xmath6 ) are random variables , the newly defined quantity @xmath28 is also a random variable obeying some distribution @xmath29 . as discussed above , the random variables @xmath26 are assumed independent within smft , allowing us to express the distribution @xmath30 by a @xmath22-fold scaled convolution @xmath31 making use of the convolution theorem , this can be reduced to two one - dimensional fourier transforms by introducing the characteristic function @xmath32 in terms of which the function @xmath33 can be expressed as @xmath34^z \\ , e^{-i t \\eta / j } \\label{qdistribution}.\\ ] ]",

    "the numerical procedure is discussed in app .",
    "[ multi_grid_fft ] .",
    "the self - consistency condition can now be formulated in the following way : if the on - site energy @xmath35 is randomly drawn from @xmath9 and @xmath26 is randomly drawn from the self - consistently determined distribution @xmath19 for each of the @xmath22 nearest neighbors , this defines the single site hamiltonian ( [ eff_ss_hamiltonian ] ) , which can be diagonalized providing the ground state @xmath36 .",
    "from there , a new mfp @xmath37 can be calculated , with the self - consistency requiring the distribution of this new random variable to be exactly the distribution @xmath19 we initially assumed for the neighboring @xmath26 s .    to cast this condition into functional form for a probability distribution in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. for an infinitely large system at fixed density ) ,",
    "we first define the function    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the ground state of @xmath40 given in  ( [ eff_ss_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it is useful to introduce the _ conditional _ pdf , which is a function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , giving the probability density for a specified value @xmath42 if the value of @xmath41 is fixed and @xmath35 is distributed according to @xmath9 .",
    "this can be obtained by using the transformation property of a pdf under a variable transform and takes the form @xmath43 this function does not obey any self - consistency condition and can be evaluated directly , which is the first step in finding @xmath19 .",
    "remembering that the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath19 is given by ( [ def_q ] ) , so that we can express the self - consistency condition as @xmath44 the right hand side can be understood as follows : for every fixed @xmath41 we have a pdf @xmath45 , which yields a contribution with the respective weight @xmath30 , leading to a marginal distribution for the considered site . if this agrees with the initially assumed distribution @xmath19 , a self consistent solution has been found .    once this is determined , expectation values of local , self - averaging operators @xmath46 can be directly be determined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an effective disorder averaged density operator , incorporating thermal , on - site energy and mfp fluctuations , depending explicitly on @xmath9 and the self - consistently determined @xmath30 .      to solve the smft equations numerically , we iterate the self - consistency equations on a discretized grid for @xmath42 , consisting of a superposition of a variable number of equidistantly spaced grids , as explained in app .",

    "[ app : numerical_cdf ] ) . working with the cumulative distribution on a numerical level , as opposed to the pdf itself , is far more controlled and circumvents divergences in the pdf @xmath19 , but also in the conditional pdf @xmath45 . the self - consistency condition ( [ selfconsistency ] )",
    "is not influenced by this approach . as can be seen by inspection ,",
    "the insulating solution @xmath50 is always a self - consistent solution , equivalent to the @xmath51 solution in the single site theory .",
    "however , in the sf regime , there also exists a second , non - trivial self - consistent solution , which corresponds to a lower grand canonical potential and is therefore the physical solution in this case .",
    "furthermore , the physical solution is always found to be the attractive fixed point of the self - consistency mapping in the space of probability distributions , i.e. if the iteration procedure is started at any @xmath52 , the successive distributions continuously converge towards the physical distribution .",
    "we start the iterative procedure with an initial pdf @xmath53 , where all the weight is distributed at small , but non - zero values of @xmath42 , assuring fast convergence in the insulating state and in the vicinity of the phase border .",
    "the distribution in the @xmath4-th iteration step for the scaled sum of mfps from the nearest neighboring sites @xmath54 is calculated from @xmath55 using the convolution theorem for independent random variables and the fft algorithm ( see app .",
    "[ multigrid ] ) . the new distribution @xmath56 is then obtained by integration over @xmath41 .",
    "numerically this is done by using the trapezoidal rule , as we found that using higher order techniques , such as simpson s rule , is not robust and lead to incorrect results if @xmath57-peaks appear in the pdf .    in the vicinity of the phase border , the computational effort increases due to two effects .",
    "firstly , the convergence is critically slowed down , increasing the required number of iterations .",
    "secondly , the discretization of the @xmath42-grid plays an ever increasing role and in some parameter regimes directly on the outside of the the mi lobes , where the converged distributions are very close to a @xmath57-peak at @xmath51 , the numerically determined form of the distributions depends on the discretization ( resolution ) , which is clearly unphysical . in these cases , we have to determine @xmath19 by examining a sequence of converged distributions at ever increasing resolution and define the physical distribution as the limit of this sequence .",
    "for the disordered bhm , three different phases exist at zero temperature : a mott insulating state , where number fluctuations are suppressed and the particles are localized due to a repulsive interaction .",
    "this state exhibits a finite energy gap of order @xmath10 , thus the single - particle density of states ( dos ) at @xmath58 vanishes and the state is incompressible .    if tunneling - induced delocalization dominates , the system is in a condensate ( sf ) phase , where a macroscopic number of particles can lower their energy by condensing into one single - particle state , thus exhibiting quantum coherence and leading to a finite condensate fraction . within a grand - canonical mean - field description ,",
    "this phase breaks the @xmath59-symmetry of the bh hamiltonian ( [ bh_hamiltonian ] ) and leads to a non - zero order parameter .",
    "the phase border from the sf to any of the insulating phases is thus determined by smft , where finite weight in @xmath19 moves to finite values of @xmath42 .",
    "finally , there is the bose glass phase , where particles are localized by an interplay of disorder and interactions .",
    "however , there exists no single particle state which is occupied macroscopically and thus the bg is not a condensate , i.e. the condensate fraction vanishes ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , there does exist an extensive number of localized single particle states , each of which is occupied by an arbitrarily large , but not macroscopic number of particles .",
    "this may be understood as a highly fragmented system of _ incoherent _ localized ` non - macroscopic quasi - condensates ' .",
    "the transition from a bg to a mi is not determined from the self - consistent distribution @xmath19 , but by analyzing the compressibility @xmath60 or the single particle dos .",
    "we consider the latter quantity within two frameworks :    1 .   considering the purely sing site particle- and hole excitations as specified in @xcite .",
    "the bg extends over the region where @xmath61 and values of the chemical potential @xmath62 , i.e. the borders are independent of @xmath6 and a direct mi - sf transition is possible .",

    "increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath64 , the mott insulating state remains the ground state until the energy difference between the mi state and the @xmath65 particle ( hole ) state vanishes , at which point particles delocalize and condense into these states .",
    "now let us return to the disordered case : here the local particle ( hole ) excitations will not hybridize into fully delocalized states with well - defined quasi - momentum @xmath63 , but into inhomogeneous states , which depend on the individual disorder configuration .",
    "it is however possible to make exact statements about the eigen - energy spectrum for a disordered system in the thermodynamic limit : the lowest kinetic energy is obtained in locally homogeneous regions and approaches the energy of the @xmath65 particle ( hole ) state of the pure system , as the size of this locally homogeneous lifshitz region increases .",
    "furthermore , scaling predicts that the dependence of the kinetic energy on the specific boundaries to the lifshitz region will reduce , as the size of the region increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential energy of the particle ( hole ) state is minimized , when the local on - site energy takes on the lowest ( highest ) possible value over the whole region , i.e. lies at the extrema of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , upper ( lower ) phase boundary of the mott lobe in the disordered system is obtained by shifting the upper ( lower ) boundary down ( up ) by @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "a central statement in @xcite is , that the disorder - averaged single particle dos calculated by considering purely local excitations only , allows for a clear distinction at @xmath14 between the bg and the normal phase , as it is zero in the latter .",
    "however , when considering delocalized excitations in the particle and hole sector , this statement holds no longer , as there are generally degenerate states in the @xmath68-particle particle - hole band and the particle ( hole ) band in the @xmath69 sector ( or the @xmath70 sector for the hole band ) , which can be seen from the single particle dos in the lehmann representation @xmath71 .",
