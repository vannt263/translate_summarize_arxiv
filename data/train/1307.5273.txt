    "<S> it has a perfect blend of gravity ( g ) , quantum theory ( @xmath2 ) and special relativity ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> whatever new quantum theory of gravity one can formulate with the minimal physical length scale it should obey special relativity at energy scales much less than the planck energy . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key interest among the candidate theories of quantum gravity is to develop a low energy effective theory consistent with classical general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> recently many issues have been raised from the phenomenological point of view @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> present cosmological observations are expected to observe leading order effects in @xmath3 around the classical background . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically this may mean modification in the dispersion relation which contain energy dependent effects contributed by different orders in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the assumptions related to the planck scale deformation of lorentz symmetry the effects can ( or can not ) be observed in the observations with ultra high energy cosmic rays and tev photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even we may observe dependence of the speed of light on energy in gamma - ray bursts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quite recently many authors argued that lorentz symmetry may not be a fundamental symmetry as the construction of classical general relativity does not require lorentz symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> but it is also important that any theory of quantum gravity should respect lorentz invariance at much lower energies compared to the planck energy . </S>",
    "<S> one of the candidate theory is doubly special relativity which deals with lorentz invariance very sensitively @xcite in the sense that all inertial observers agree that the speed of light is constant along with planck energy which is also constant . </S>",
    "<S> the transformations act non - linearly on the momentum space introducing terms of the order of @xmath5 . as an artifact the quadratic invariant </S>",

    "<S> we can consider the notion that spacetime geometry depends on the energy of the particle distorting it @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is the scale at which spacetime geometry is probed . in doubly special relativity non - linear lorentz transformation </S>",
    "<S> leads to a modified energy momentum dispersion relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are commonly known as rainbow functions and @xmath10 . for a doubly general relativity </S>",
    "<S> a modified equivalence principle was proposed in @xcite which requires that one parameter family of energy dependent orthonormal frame fields describe a one parameter family of energy dependent metrics given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> but in the limit @xmath14 general relativity must be recovered . with the definition of one parameter family of energy momentum tensors </S>",
    "<S> einstein s equations are also modified as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an effective energy dependent newton constant expected to satisfy a renormalization group equation . </S>",
    "<S> recent developments along the above mentioned lines can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> modified frw solution is studied in the rainbow framework in @xcite and in @xcite the semi - classical rainbow cosmological model is shown to be singularity free analogous to the bounce in loop quantum cosmology .    inspired by the earlier results in this present work we would like to study the isotropic quantum cosmological perfect fluid model in the rainbow framework . </S>",
    "<S> this is just a toy model to interpret the possible bounce which is a final outcome of the study in terms of the rainbow functions . </S>",
    "<S> one critical problem in quantum cosmology is certainly of a suitable choice of time against which the evolution of the universe is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the notion of time has different implications in general relativity and quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> if matter is taken as a perfect fluid , the strategy adopted by schutz @xcite becomes extremely useful , as a set of canonical transformations leads to one conjugate momentum associated with the fluid giving a linear contribution to the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding fluid variable thus qualifies to play the role of time in the relevant schr@xmath0dinger equation . in an ever expanding model </S>",
    "<S> , the fluid density has a monotonic temporal behavior and the time orientability is thus ensured . </S>",
    "<S> schutz s formalism has been extensively used by many authors for isotropic @xcite and anisotropic @xcite cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> matter content is taken as a perfect fluid with an equation of state @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> for some recent literature see @xcite and the references therein . for the rainbow isotropic model we found finite norm wave packet solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation . </S>",
    "<S> one important finding is that the singularity free cosmological model could be constructed even without violating the energy conditions with a suitable choice of @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevant action for gravity with a perfect fluid can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the induced metric over three dimensional spatial hypersurface which is the boundary @xmath21 of the four dimensional manifold @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the extrinsic curvature . here </S>",

    "<S> @xmath25 is the pressure due to the perfect fluid which satisfies the equation of state @xmath26 with @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this restriction stems from the consideration that sound waves can not propagate faster than light . </S>",

    "<S> let us first calculate the hamiltonian for the fluid part . </S>",
    "<S> in schutz s formalism @xcite the fluid s four velocity can be expressed in terms of six potentials . </S>",
    "<S> however two of them are connected with rotation . </S>",
    "<S> frw type models permit timelike geodesics which are hypersurface orthogonal , the rotation tensor @xmath31 vanishes and one can write the four velocity in terms of only four independent potentials as @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the velocity potentials having their own evolution equations , where the potentials connected with vorticity are dropped . </S>",
    "<S> the four velocity is normalized as @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> although the physical identification of velocity potentials are irrelevant for the formulation , @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be identified with the specific enthalpy and specific entropy respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this identification facilitates the representation of fluid parameters in terms of thermodynamic quantities . for the fluid part </S>",
    "<S> , the action can be written using thermodynamic relations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant equations are @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are temperature , total mass energy density , rest mass density and specific internal energy respectively . rewriting the third equation of ( [ thereq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath41 ~~.\\ ] ] we can follow that one possible solution is @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we can show that the equation of state takes the form @xmath44 in a comoving system @xmath45 we can evaluate the lagrangian for the perfect fluid as @xmath46 as @xmath47 so @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we can write the hamiltonian of the perfect fluid in final form as @xmath49 here we have used the following canonical transformations of @xcite @xmath50 to write the hamiltonian in the simple form ( linear in @xmath51 ) where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the advantage of using this method , i.e. , using canonical transformations , is that we could find a set of variables where the system of equations is more tractable , while the hamiltonian structure of the system remains intact . for the gravity sector </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian and the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the super hamiltonian for the minisuperspace of this model can now be written as @xmath58 ~~.\\ ] ] here @xmath29 is the lagrange multiplier taking care of the classical constraint equation @xmath59 . in this equation @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> may play the role of cosmic time if we choose the gauge @xmath61 and this follow from the classical equation as @xmath62 . using the usual quantization procedure </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we write the schr@xmath0dinger - wheeler - dewitt equation for our super hamiltonian with the ansatz that the super hamiltonian operator annihilates the wave function @xmath63 here @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the operator ordering parameter . </S>",
    "<S> only factor orderings consisting of the representation of the square momentum of @xmath67 in the form @xmath68 are considered . </S>",
    "<S> here we can see that rainbow function @xmath69 do not take part in the schr@xmath0dinger - wheeler - dewitt equation just like @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as a scaling of the lapse function @xmath29 by @xmath70 . in order to solve for the wave function </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 we employ the separation of variables as @xmath72 to get for flat case @xmath73 @xmath74 here we would like to interpret @xmath6 as the scale at which the minisuperspace ( in our case ) is probed . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for this comes from the fact that the canonically conjugate momenta ( @xmath51 ) of @xmath75 is linear in the super hamiltonian . in analogy to quantum mechanics this is equivalent to the time independent schr@xmath0dinger equation @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> further we would like to consider the fact that the perfect fluid is composed of baryons which can undergo transmutation but the baryon number is conserved @xcite . following the proposal of @xcite here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize that @xmath6 is the total energy of the system of baryons that is measured by a freely falling inertial observer .    </S>",
    "<S> the solution of ( [ phieq ] ) is known and we finally write @xmath77^{\\frac{q+1}{2 } } ( 24e)^{\\frac{q+1}{6(1-\\alpha ) } } \\bigg [ c_1 j_{\\frac{q+1}{3(1-\\alpha)}}\\bigg\\{\\frac{4\\sqrt{6e}}{3(1-\\alpha ) } \\left(\\frac{a}{g_2(e / e_p)}\\right)^{\\frac{3(1-\\alpha)}{2}}\\bigg\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & + c_2 j_{-\\frac{q+1}{3(1-\\alpha)}}\\bigg\\{\\frac{4\\sqrt{6e}}{3(1-\\alpha ) } \\left(\\frac{a}{g_2(e / e_p)}\\right)^{\\frac{3(1-\\alpha)}{2}}\\bigg\\ } \\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 are the arbitrary integration constants . </S>",
    "<S> now we can construct a regular wave packet superposing these solutions capable of describing physical states . </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath79 ( choosing @xmath80 would also give the same final result ) we can write @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83^{\\frac{q+1}{6(1-\\alpha)}}$ ] and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> now let us choose a form of @xmath18 consistent with earlier literature . among different choices in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the choice @xmath85 and @xmath86 was considered where @xmath87 but this choice leads to energy dependent theory of light . in @xcite @xmath88 was considered which do not give a theory with varying @xmath89 and capable of solving the horizon problem . </S>",
    "<S> other choices were considered in @xcite but mainly with @xmath90 . here </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the choice of @xcite which considered @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice among many others is argued to give a theory where relativity of inertial frames is preserved , all observers agree with the invariant energy scale @xmath94 , the uhecr threshold can be increased and there will be a maximum momentum for the granularity of space . </S>",
    "<S> so with the choice @xmath95 and @xmath92 we can rewrite eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wp1 ] ) as @xmath96 r^2 } ~j_{\\nu}\\big\\{r e^{-\\frac{9(1-\\alpha)^3}{64 e_p}r^2 } a^{\\frac{3(1-\\alpha)}{2}}\\big\\ } dr\\ ] ] where @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the integral can be evaluated analytically if we make the approximation @xmath98 for the range of the integral . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation can be justified by the fact that @xmath99 . in the region of large values of @xmath100 </S>",
    "<S> where the approximation is not applicable , the contribution due to the argument of the bessel function to the integral is in fact negligible owing to the gaussian prefactor in front of the bessel function . </S>",
    "<S> also the form of the gaussian prefactor indicates that the convergence of the integral requires @xmath101 to be positive , so that @xmath102 .    after evaluation </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet takes the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 . using the many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we can calculate the expectation value of the scale factor as @xmath105 a straightforward calculation yields @xmath106^{\\frac{1}{3(1-\\alpha ) } } ~~.\\ ] ] so our model represents a bouncing universe with no singularity at @xmath107 and in the asymptotic limit @xmath108 the model reduces to flat frw universe . </S>",
    "<S> quantum cosmological perfect fluid models are plagued with the problem of operator ordering . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the problem was studied with @xmath109 . if we see eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expv ] ) we realize that @xmath110 at @xmath111 and our interpretation of bounce with no singularity breaks down . restriction on @xmath112 is a serious drawback of this model . </S>",
    "<S> even operator ordering affects anisotropic quantum cosmological models which suffer from non- unitarity and in @xcite we showed that the problem can only be alleviated by a proper choice of operator ordering . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig ] ) we plot @xmath113 vs @xmath67 and @xmath75 for @xmath109 and @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wave packet is peaked at the expectation value of @xmath67 at @xmath107 which confirms our interpretation of bounce .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     this result is not at all new as we have just reproduced the result of @xcite . but in @xcite one has to consider an extra gaussian superposition factor with strong intention for a finite norm wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> but here we see that a suitable choice of the rainbow function @xmath9 allowed us to build a bouncing singularity free cosmological model which asymptotically behave like the flat frw universe . </S>",
    "<S> our result regarding the singularity is in good agreement with @xcite where the rainbow modified frw equations were treated as effective equations and compared the results with those of loop quantum cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the expectation value of the scale factor depends on the operator ordering parameter of the schr@xmath0dinger - wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath66 which effects the bouncing nature of the model . as @xmath97 so we must have @xmath102 to get a singularity free universe which is a drawback of this model . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the anisotropic models are plagued by the problem of non - unitarity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so it may be interesting to study if some choice of the rainbow functions can cure the non - unitarity in anisotropic models . </S>",
    "<S> so finally we would like to emphasize that it is possible to construct singularity free cosmological models in the formalism of rainbow gravity with specific choices of the rainbow functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> but it is very important to consider the approach with fundamental quantum fields which play essential role in the very early universe . </S>"
