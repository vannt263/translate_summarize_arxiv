    "more recently , the physics of the @xmath9 model raised a renewed interest due to the discovery of three vanadate compounds ( li@xmath10vosio@xmath11 , li@xmath10vogeo@xmath11 and vomoo@xmath11 ) which appear to be characterized by antiferromagnetic nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions between spin-@xmath12 v@xmath13 ions @xcite .    at the classical level",

    "indeed , if the frustration is not strong enough to destroy the long range order , the low temperature physics of the systems is believed to be the same of the non - frustrated case , with physical properties , such as spin stiffness and spin velocity , renormalized by the inclusion of frustration .",

    "the original method developed by wilson has been largely employed for the investigation of the properties of quantum systems , but , contrary to the weak coupling rg method applied to effective field theories , our approach does not require any mapping on coarse grained actions and applies to all temperature regimes .",
    "the resulting evolution equation is formally exact but it is not written in a closed form : an ansatz for the momentum and frequency dependence of the dynamical structure factor is needed in order to put the equation in a closed and solvable form .",

    "calculations have been performed for spin @xmath24 and @xmath82 and different values of the frustration ratio , in order to investigate the role and extent of quantum corrections on top of the semiclassical spin - wave picture .",
    "the investigated range of frustration is restricted to @xmath148 because beyond this point , fluctuations at wavevector @xmath149 are expected to become important and our simple parametrization of the dynamical correlation functions can not be retained .",
    "the spontaneous staggered magnetization extrapolates to zero at about @xmath150 for @xmath24 while a stronger frustration is required for @xmath82 . within the qhrt approach ,",
    "both the spin velocity and stiffness are related to the order parameter and therefore are expected to vanish at the quantum critical point . for comparison",
    "we recall that in the non linear sigma model representation of the quantum antiferromagnets , when the @xmath85 critical point is approached , both the staggered magnetization and the spin stiffness vanish , while the spin velocity is expected to remain finite .",
    "our results indicate that frustration strongly suppresses the correlations at finite temperature but , at the same time , the value of the crossover temperature @xmath136 remains basically unchanged when the frustration is increased .",
    "this fact may suggest a very narrow critical region near the quantum transition or a shift of the quantum critical point toward larger values of @xmath144 .",
    "the estimate of the renormalized stiffness @xmath116 obtained via the low temperature divergence of the correlation length , eq .",
    "( [ expo ] ) , does not vanish in the whole frustration range we investigated and is remarkably larger than the direct evaluation of the stiffness @xmath94 obtained through the zero temperature static structure factor ( [ rhos0 ] ) .",
    "the equality of these two quantities is commonly expected on the basis of the known behavior of the su@xmath125 sigma - model in the @xmath151 limit and the rg analysis in @xmath128 dimension @xcite .",
    "the difference in the two estimates of @xmath94 we found in the su@xmath152 case is most likely a consequence of the approximate closure ( [ correl ] ) we have studied , as shown by a detailed analysis of the classical limit of the qhrt equations . in order to go beyond the approximation examined in this work , a representation of the low temperature spin correlations richer than those commonly adopted in the many body literature @xcite is needed .",
    "nowadays , real materials displaying the properties of the @xmath3 model in the nel phase have not been yet synthesized .",
    "nevertheless , the recent experiments at high pressure performed on the li@xmath10vosio@xmath11 @xcite seem to indicate that a wide range of the @xmath3 phase diagram can be studied by applying high hydrostatic pressure , which modifies the frustration ratio @xmath153 by changing the bond lengths and angles . although the relationship between pressure and frustration ratio is not obvious at all , we believe that the results of our investigation may be useful for the interpretation of future neutron scattering or nmr - nqr experiments .",
    "in addition ground state configuration of the vomoo@xmath11 compound is still a controversial issue , first principle calculation of the j@xmath10 coupling being in disagreement with the estimates based on the nmr - nqr experiments .",
    "specific heat data  @xcite for the vomoo@xmath11 compound may be analyzed on the basis of our finite - temperature results , the position of the maximum in the zero - field specific heat giving an alternative way for estimating the frustration parameter .",
