    "the relevance of magnetic energy in powering the emission from neutron stars ( nss ) , suggested more than four decades ago @xcite , has been well established with the discoveries of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "these are spinning - down , isolated nss characterized by the emission of powerful bursts and flares and with luminosities in the soft and hard x - rays greater than their rotational energy loss .",
    "historically , axps and sgrs were divided into two distinct classes reflecting the way they were discovered , but many observations indicate that there are no substantial differences between them .",
    "most axps were discovered as bright pulsars in the soft x - ray range ( @xmath110 kev ) and initially not distinguished from the more numerous population of x - ray binaries powered by accretion .",
    "it was then pointed out that their narrow period distribution , long term spin - down , soft x - ray spectrum and faint optical counterparts were at variance with the properties of pulsars in massive binaries @xcite .",
    "sgrs were instead discovered in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray range through the observation of bright and short bursts and classified as a subclass of gamma - ray bursts @xcite , with the notable property of `` repeating '' from the same sky direction .",
    "when the persistent x - ray counterparts of sgrs were identified , it was found that they are pulsating sources very similar to the axps .    even though alternative interpretations have been proposed , the model involving magnetars , i.e. highly magnetized nss , is the one that most successfully explains the properties of axps and sgrs and is currently widely accepted .",
    "according to the magnetar model , the emission from these sources is ultimately powered by the energy stored in their strong magnetic fields , which reach b@xmath210@xmath3 g in the magnetosphere , and likely even higher values in the ns interior .",
    "this sets them apart from most other nss which are powered by rotational energy , accretion , or residual heat .",
    "in the last few years it has been realized that the observational distinction between magnetars and other nss is not as sharp - cut as previously considered and not solely based on the magnetic field intensity .",
    "this was already suggested by the existence of some radio pulsars with inferred values of b overlapping those of axps / sgrs , but which never showed bursts , flares or other signs of magnetically - powered emission .",
    "the recent discovery of nss that , despite their relatively low external dipole fields , can certainly be classified as axps / sgrs based on their outburst properties , indicates that the important discriminant is most likely related to the strength and geometry of the magnetic field in the ns interior , which unfortunately is less prone to direct estimates .    in the first part of this paper",
    "i briefly describe why it is believed that the energy sources which are seen to operate in other nss can not power the emission of axps / sgrs .",
    "the two following sections are devoted to the observational properties of these sources ( section 3 ) and the main features of the magnetar model ( section 4 ) .",
    "the discovery and implications of magnetars with low dipole field and possible relations of axps / sgrs with other classes of isolated nss are discussed in the last two sections . for other reviews on these sources",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the rotational energy of a ns with spin period p=2@xmath4/@xmath5 is e@xmath6/2=2@xmath7 erg , where i = i@xmath8 g @xmath9 is the star moment of inertia and radius @xmath10 is in the range @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ( @xmath13 g @xmath9 for most equations of state . ] . soon after the discovery of pulsars it was found that their spin periods are increasing , implying a loss rate of rotational energy , @xmath14 , sufficiently high to power not only the pulsed radio emission , but also the bright radio / optical / x - ray nebulae observed around the most energetic pulsars .",
    "the first striking example was provided by the pulsar psr b0531 + 21 , whose @xmath14=4.6@xmath15 erg s@xmath16 matches the total energy output of the surrounding crab nebula=5@xmath15 erg s@xmath16 . ] .",
    "most of the spin - down power is lost in a poynting - dominated wind rather than in beamed photons from the pulsar . despite the majority of rotation - powered pulsars",
    "is observed at radio wavelengths ( over 2,000 ) , their energy output in this band is only a very small fraction of @xmath14 .",
    "the efficiency is higher in the x - ray band , where non - thermal emission is observed in about one hundred pulsars , with an average efficiency @xmath1710@xmath18 , but with a large dispersion around this value @xcite . at @xmath0-ray energies",
    "the efficiency approaches 100% for middle aged - pulsars ( at these high values it is important to specify the solid angle of the radiation beam used in computing the efficiency ) .",
    "axps / sgrs have period derivatives @xmath19 larger than those of radio psrs , but their long periods lead to values of @xmath20 erg s@xmath16 , too small to power their luminosity , but during outburst they are as luminous as the persistent ones . ] .",
    "this is a robust conclusion , even when luminosity uncertainties deriving from the poorly known distances of some axps / sgrs are considered , and it rules out the possibility of interpreting these sources as rotationally powered nss .    of course , the energy budget argument to rule out rotation - powered emission does not apply if one assumes that axps / sgrs are isolated white dwarfs . due to its higher moment of inertia , a rotating white dwarf has a spin - down power 10@xmath2110@xmath22 times larger than that of a ns for the same p and @xmath19 values .",
    "this idea was first proposed for , a 7 s x - ray pulsar at the center of the supernova remnant ctb 109 @xcite , which attracted attention well before the recognition of the axps as a separate class of objects @xcite .",
    "other authors proposed models for axps / sgrs based on white dwarfs @xcite , but these are challenged by the short spin periods observed in some objects and by the deep upper limits on the optical counterpart of  @xcite .",
    "mass accretion is a well established process in x - ray binaries .",
    "the first extra - solar x - ray source , sco x-1 , discovered in the rocket experiment that marked the beginning of x - ray astronomy 50 years ago @xcite , is an accreting ns .",
    "we now know several hundreds accretion - powered nss in our galaxy , as well as in other galaxies .",
    "all of them are accreting matter provided by their companion stars in binary systems .",
    "some of the x - ray sources now belonging to the axp group were once believed to be powered by accretion from a binary companion , the most natural explanation at that time , based on analogy with the other x - ray pulsars .",
    "however , deep observations in the optical and near infrared ( nir ) failed to detect the luminous counterparts expected if these pulsars were in high - mass binaries .",
    "furthermore , x - ray timing studies did not show the orbital doppler shifts expected for binary motion , ruling out also low - mass systems @xcite .",
    "optical / nir counterparts have now been firmly identified ( on the basis of correlated variability ) , or proposed ( on the basis of accurate positional coincidence ) for several axps / sgrs . in most cases they are sufficiently faint to rule out normal companion stars and the presence of accretion disks . in three sources ( see table 1 ) the optical emission is modulated at the period observed at x - rays , implying that it comes from the same rotating object and not from a binary companion .    all these findings strongly indicate that axps / sgrs are isolated nss .",
    "they could be powered by accretion only if matter is provided either by the interstellar medium ( ism ) or by a disk of fall - back material produced in the supernova explosion from which the ns originated .",
    "the former possibility is ruled out because , for typical ns velocities and ism densities , the resulting accretion rate is too small .",
    "models invoking residual disks around isolated nss are instead more plausible and represent the most widely discussed alternative to the magnetar interpretation @xcite . in this class of models various mechanisms for the disk formation and different origins for the observed x - ray luminosity",
    "have been considered .",
    "the interaction with the fossil disk is also invoked to account for the observed long periods and rapid spin - down values . according to @xcite , who proposed a scenario which unifies the different classes of isolated nss , the initial properties of a fall - back disk are among the fundamental parameters that determine the fate of a ns .",
    "the main objection to models based on accretion onto isolated nss is that they can not easily account for the bursts and flares observed in axps / sgrs , thus requiring some additional mechanism and/or energy source to explain these phenomena .",
    "one possibility , often considered in so - called `` hybrid models '' , is that the strong magnetic field powering the bursts is not dipolar , but it is only present in higher order multipoles dominating near the ns surface . they differ from the magnetar model because accretion is invoked to explain the axps / sgrs persistent x - ray emission .      at birth ,",
    "nss have internal temperatures of @xmath1710@xmath23 k at birth , that rapidly drop to @xmath1710@xmath24 k. the dominant cooling mechanism for the following @xmath1710@xmath25 years is neutrino emission from the star s isothermal core .",
    "this leads to surface temperatures of several @xmath26 to @xmath27 k , with emission peaking in the soft x - ray band ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "temperature gradients on the star s surface modulate the observed flux at the rotation period .",
    "thermal x - ray emission can be detected in isolated ns with ages of @xmath28 years , provided they are sufficiently close and the x - rays not too absorbed by the ism .",
    "older nss are too cool to significantly emit in the x - rays band , while in the youngest pulsars the thermal radiation is difficult to detect because it is outshined by the brighter non - thermal emission powered by @xmath14 .",
    "there are two relevant observational properties of axps / sgrs that can not be explained resorting only to the ns thermal energy content : ( i ) the production of a variety of strongly variable and energetic events , ranging from short bursts to giant flares flares , and ( ii ) the presence of hard tails in the spectra of the persistent emission .",
    "short bursts of hard x - rays , historically the defining characteristics of sgrs , have now been observed in virtually all the axps .",
    "their durations ( @xmath29 s ) , hard spectra ( characteristic temperatures @xmath173040 kev ) with little or no spectral evolution , and high peak luminosity ( up to @xmath30 erg s@xmath16 ) can not be explained by the emission of the ns residual heat .",
    "persistent emission with power - law spectra extending up to hundreds of kev has been discovered with integral in several axps / sgrs @xcite .",
    "the luminosity in these ( pulsed ) hard tails is a significant fraction of the total energy output from axps / sgrs and requires the presence of non - thermal phenomena in their magnetospheres .",
    "as discussed above , the main powering mechanisms at work in other kinds of nss have problems to explain the properties of axps / sgrs .",
    "this motivated interest in the alternative proposal of a magnetically - powered emission and led to the development of models based on magnetars @xcite .",
    "the magnetic energy of a ns with field b@xmath31=10@xmath3 g filling its entire volume is 3@xmath3210@xmath33 erg ( for a ns radius of 12 km ) .",
    "this is enough to power a luminosity of @xmath1710@xmath34 erg s@xmath16 for @xmath1710@xmath21 years , a plausible age for axps / sgrs , considering their frequent association with supernova remnants ( snrs ) or young clusters of massive stars ergs can be released , are energetically more challenging .",
    "this limits the number of such events that a magnetar can emit in its lifetime . ] .",
    "slightly higher fields and/or long - lasting episodes with low luminosity ( as in transients ) make the energy budget adequate for all the magnetar candidates observed to date .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence that indicate the presence of a high magnetic field in axps / sgrs . the conventional way to estimate the magnetic field of isolated nss is based on the relation    @xmath35    which gives the dipolar field as a function of the spin period and its time derivative is the value on the star surface at the magnetic equator . the surface field at the pole is a factor of two larger . ] .",
    "this relation is based on the simplified and unrealistic assumption that the observed spin - down is caused by the emission of a rotating dipole in vacuum ( with orthogonal magnetic and rotation axes ) .",
    "more realistic models of the ns magnetosphere give values within a factor of two from the previous expression ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) .    equation ( 1 ) yields for the axps / sgrs magnetic fields higher than those of typical radio pulsars and up to b@xmath36@xmath1710@xmath3 g ( see table [ tab : prop ] ) .",
    "although often quoted as the evidence that these objects are magnetars , this argument _ by itself _ is rather weak and subject to criticism . for example , other processes , such as the ejection of a wind of relativistic particles , can contribute to the observed torque @xcite .    indeed , the evidence for strong magnetic fields powering the axps / sgrs , supported by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , comes from several concurring observations , of which the most compelling are related to the extreme properties of the giant flares of sgrs .",
    "giant flares start with a short , extremely bright spike , lasting a fraction of a second , during which photons reaching mev energies are emitted with a hard spectrum .",
    "this is followed by a tail with a softer spectrum , lasting several minutes and pulsed at the ns rotation period .",
    "the short duration of the initial spikes is consistent with the propagation time of the magnetic instability over the whole ns surface with alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "the confinement of the hot plasma responsible for the pulsating tails requires the presence of a strong magnetic field , and sets a lower limit of the order of a few 10@xmath37 g on its intensity .",
    "although only three giant flares have been observed , the sources which showed such rare events are , for what concerns all the other properties , undistinguishable from the other sgrs / axps .",
    "other motivations for a high magnetic field come from the short bursts , which have now been detected from almost all axps / sgrs .",
    "the peak luminosity of the bursts exceed by a few orders of magnitude the eddington limit for a ns .",
    "this is possible because the intense magnetic field affects electron scattering , which becomes strongly anisotropic and dependent on the photon polarization mode .",
    "the cross section of the extraordinary mode ( * @xmath38 * @xmath39 * * @xmath40**=0 ) photons with angular frequency @xmath41 is reduced by a factor ( @xmath42/@xmath43 with respect to the thomson value . as a consequence",
    "the radiative flux can exceed the classical eddington limit in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "another evidence for very high magnetic fields in sgrs has been pointed out by @xcite , who considered the high - frequency quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed during the giant flare of .",
    "the qpos at 625 and 1840 hz involved extremely large and rapid luminosity variations , with @xmath44l/@xmath44 t as large as several 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath46 .",
    "this value exceeds the luminosity - variability limit @xmath44l/@xmath44 t @xmath1 @xmath47  2@xmath48 erg s@xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the efficiency of matter to radiation conversion @xcite . the relativistic effects , generally invoked to circumvent this limit ( e.g. in blazars and gamma - ray bursts ) are unlikely to be at work in the sgr qpo phenomenon .",
    "@xcite instead propose that the cavallo - rees limit does not apply thanks to the reduction in the photon scattering cross section induced by the strong magnetic field . in this way a lower limit of @xmath49 g @xmath50 @xmath51 for the surface magnetic field is derived .",

    "strongly magnetized nss can form if they are born with initial spin period @xmath52 shorter than the overturn time of @xmath17310 ms of the convection driven by the high neutrino luminosity l@xmath53 erg s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the efficient dynamo resulting in this case can generate magnetic fields as high as @xmath54 g. rapid neutrino cooling in the proto - ns is essential in driving the strong turbulent convection which amplifies the seed field .",
    "such a dynamo operates only for a few seconds , but , in principle , it can generate fields as high as 10@xmath55 g , most likely with a multipolar structure and with a strong toroidal component , in the ns interior @xcite .",
    "an alternative formation scenario has also been proposed , according to which magnetars would be the descendent of the stars with the highest magnetic fields .",
    "the wide distribution of field intensities in magnetic white dwarfs has been attributed to the spread in the magnetic fields of their progenitors and a similar situation could apply to nss @xcite .",
    "the possible association of some axps / sgrs with clusters of massive stars seems to indicate that they descend from stars of mass above @xmath1740 @xmath56 .",

    "magnetic field decay provides a source of internal heating which can play an important role in the x - ray emission from the surface of magnetars .",
    "this internal heating source yields a surface temperature higher than that of a cooling ns of the same age and smaller magnetic field .",
    "the enhanced thermal conductivity in the strongly magnetized envelope contributes to raise the surface temperature @xcite .",
    "the decay of the magnetic field is in turn affected by the ns temperature evolution , which makes it difficult to derive a self - consistent , complete and realistic model .",
    "simulations in 2-d have been performed for the case in which the magnetic field is sustained by currents in the ns crust @xcite .",
    "they indicate that systematically higher surface temperatures are obtained for nss with strong internal toroidal fields .",
    "the evolution of the internal field deforms the ns crust contributing to the persistent x - ray emission through low level seismic activity and storing magneto / elastic energy which becomes available to power bursts and flares when the crust cracks .",

    "a first attempt to derive the overall bursting properties of magnetars , taking into account the magneto / thermal evolution of the poloidal and toroidal internal field components , indicates significant differences in the energetics and recurrence time as the magnetar evolves @xcite .",
    "objects with a lower toroidal field are generally less active .",
    "the frequency of the bursts decreases with age and , to a lesser extent , also their energy .",
    "interestingly , sporadic bursts are predicted for magnetic fields as low as a few 10@xmath57 g.    a twisted magnetosphere ( @xmath58 ) supports currents much larger than the goldreich - julian current flowing along open field lines in normal pulsars @xcite .",
    "an electron / positron corona is formed in the closed magnetosphere , consisting of flux tubes anchored on both ends to the ns surface .",
    "the currents are carried by charges extracted from the ns surface and pairs produced along the flux tubes .",
    "the strong flow of charged particles provides an additional source of heating for the star surface and gives rise to a significant optical depth for resonant cyclotron scattering in the magnetosphere .",
    "repeated scattering of the thermal photons emitted at the star surface can produce the power - law components observed in the spectra of axps / sgrs @xcite .",
    "most of the models developed to derive the spectral and timing evolution properties of magnetars considered globally twisted magnetospheres , but it is more likely that the twist is imparted only to a small bundle of field lines . how the magnetic energy is dissipated in an untwisting magnetosphere has been studied in detail by @xcite , who derived expressions for the resulting luminosity evolution . most of the energy is dissipated as thermal radiation in the footprints of a bundle of twisted lines which are heated by the accelerated magnetospheric particles .",
    "the magnetosphere gradually untwists through the expansion of a potential region which causes a reduction in the area of these hot spots .",
    "the small emitting surfaces inferred from the blackbody fits of transient axps / sgrs are consistent with this scenario .",
    "an alternative possibility to explain the transient magnetars involves the fast deposition of energy deep in the ns crust @xcite . this could result , for example , from a sudden fracture driven by magnetic stresses and would induce a heating of the surface .",
    "since the subsequent thermal evolution depends primarily on the properties of the outer crust and on the depth of the energy deposition , a modelling of the outburst decays might provide some information on the star structure .",
    "however , the transients observed up to now are far from showing a uniform picture @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the systematic and statistical spectral uncertainties affecting the observations often prevent a simple comparison with the predictions of the models , as shown , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the case of  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that the maximum luminosity observable in an outburst is limited to @xmath1710@xmath59 erg s@xmath16 , independent on the amount of energy released in the crust @xcite .",
    "this is due to the self - regulating effect resulting from the strong temperature - dependence of neutrino emission and might explain why persistently bright axps / sgrs do not undergo outbursts , but change their luminosity by , at most , of a factor of a few .",
    "it is clear that the giant flares must be powered by magnetic energy , but how this exactly occurs and where the energy is accumulated before being released remain open questions .",
    "the two main scenarios which have been considered involve either the build - up of elastic energy in the crust , which finally causes a large - scale fracture @xcite , or the gradual injection of energy in the magnetosphere , which is released when an instability produces a rearrangement of the field @xcite . in the first class of models",
    "the flare occurs when the tensile strength of the crust is exceed , while in magnetospheric models it is more difficult to determine which is the triggering process that can explain the extremely rapid energy release .",
    "more data will certainly help to answer these questions , but the extremely rare and completely unpredictable nature of these events limit the observational progress .",
    "until recently the known axp / sgr with the lowest magnetic field ( as given by eq .",
    "1 ) was  with b@xmath36=6@xmath3210@xmath60 g , only slightly larger than the quantum critical field is the magnetic field for which the energy of the first landau level of the electron equals its rest mass .",
    "it was often regarded as the boundary between normal pulsars and magnetars , although there is no real physical reason or threshold effect to motivate this . ]",
    "@xmath61=4.4@xmath62 g. this pulsar , despite its value of b@xmath36 smaller than that of all the other magnetar candidates , was the first axp to show the strong bursting activity previously believed to be a prerogative of sgrs @xcite .    in june 2009",
    "the new transient  was discovered through the detection of two short bursts seen by different satellites @xcite .",
    "pulsations at 9.1 s were soon found in its x - ray emission , but despite an extensive monitoring of the outburst decay in the following months , no significant @xmath19 could be measured .",
    "this was quite unexpected because the fast spin - down rates of all the other transient axps / sgrs were always evident after only a few days of observations .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath19@xmath16@xmath3210@xmath63 s s@xmath16 obtained after two years implied b@xmath36@xmath17.5@xmath3210@xmath57 g @xcite , an unprecedented value for a source showing all the typical characteristics of a magnetar . only recently , thanks to a phase - coherent timing analysis of all the observations of  spanning more than three years , it has been possible to measure its small spin - down of ( 4@xmath641)@xmath3210@xmath63 s s@xmath16 @xcite , which translates into a field b@xmath36=6@xmath3210@xmath57 g.    a similar situation occurred for another transient ,  @xcite , discovered in july 2011 through the detection of several bursts , while a timing analysis of more than six years of data of  led to revise its previously reported @xmath19 into an upper limit @xcite .",
    "the dipole moments inferred for these two sources imply surface fields of b@xmath36=5@xmath3210@xmath60 g and b@xmath657@xmath3210@xmath60 g , respectively .",
    "they are not as low as that of , but still below that of the bulk of `` traditional '' axps / sgrs and in the range of fields inferred for a non - negligible number of rotation - powered radio pulsars .",
    "these findings indicate that a high magnetic dipole moment is not a mandatory condition for a magnetar .",
    "indeed what really matters to power the magnetar activity and emission is the strength of the internal field , and in particular of its toroidal component which is responsible for the ns crust deformation / cracking and for imparting twists to the external magnetosphere .",
    "it is also likely that the magnetosphere is not dipolar but contains a significant contribution from higher order multipoles , which increase the field close to the star surface , but fall - off rapidly with radius and do not contribute to the spin - down .",
    "it has been suggested that objects like  are old magnetars , in which a substantial decay of the magnetic field has occurred .",
    "an initial configuration with internal toroidal field of a few 10@xmath55 g and external dipole of b@xmath36=2.5@xmath3210@xmath37 g can reproduce the observed properties of  in the context of a magneto - thermal evolution with field decay @xcite . a weaker initial b@xmath36 would not spin - down the pulsar to the currently observed long period .",
    "an immediate consequence of the external field decay is that the characteristic age , defined as @xmath66=p/2@xmath19 , greatly overestimates the true age of the magnetar , which in the above model is of the order of @xmath1710@xmath22 years .",
    "as shown by the sources discussed in the previous section , a high dipole field is not a necessary condition for the onset of magnetar activity .",
    "this leads to the interesting possibility that nss with `` normal '' magnetic field values , as estimated with eq .",

    "this population could well harbor other `` hidden '' magnetars , possibly showing weak and sporadic bursting activity ( hence difficult to detect ) .",
    "magnetically - driven activity can manifest itself also through plastic deformations of the crust which appear as long term variations in the ( thermal ) emission from the star surface , rather than as abrupt bursts .",
    "a possible example has been observed in the 8.4 s x - ray pulsar , which showed spectral variability on a time scale of few years @xcite .",
    "most of the variation occurred in a relatively short timescale of half a year , in coincidence with a possible glitch @xcite .",

    "the ccos properties suggested an interpretation in terms of isolated nss with small values of @xmath14 , despite the young age inferred from their associated snrs .",
    "this has been confirmed for three ccos in which pulsations have been detected .",
    "they have periods in the 0.10.4 s range , and exceptionally small spin - down rates @xcite , yielding b@xmath36=3.1@xmath3210@xmath73 g , b@xmath36=9.8@xmath3210@xmath73 g and b@xmath36=2.9@xmath3210@xmath73 g , for the sources in kes 79 , g296.5 + 10.0 and puppis a , respectively .",
    "these ns were probably born with spin periods very close to the current values and it is likely that their relatively long initial spin period and low magnetic field be causally connected .",
    "alternatively , ccos might have been born with a higher field which was then buried beneath the ns surface by the accretion of fall back material after the supernova explosion . depending on the amount of accreted matter and on the properties of the ns crust and core",
    ", the reemergence of the field can take place on a large range of timescales , from a few thousand to several billion years @xcite .",
    "the presence of a strong buried field can help to explain the gradients in the surface temperature responsible for the large pulsed fractions and/or phase - dependent spectral properties of ccos , which are otherwise difficult to understand for their low values of b@xmath36 .",
    "the variability in the x - ray spectral feature of rx j08224300 , if related to magnetic activity , supports this connection between ccos and axps / sgrs .    finally , it is worth mentioning the swift / bat detection of two short sgr - like bursts from the direction of the peculiar x - ray / radio/@xmath0-ray source ls i + 61@xmath74 303 @xcite .",
    "this is one of the very few x - ray binaries detected at gev / tev energies .",
    "it is composed of a be type star and a compact object , which is likely a ns ( although this can not be confirmed since no pulsations have been detected and the possibility of a black hole companion has also been considered ) .",
    "the success of the magnetar model in explaining the properties of axps / sgrs indicates the existence of nss with magnetic fields of @xmath1710@xmath3 g. their extremely energetic flares yield the highest radiation fluxes which reach the earth from outside the solar system , often causing measurable effects on the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "exciting results have been obtained in the study of axps / sgrs in the latest years , contributing to change our vision of the population of nss in the galaxy .",
    "magnetars are relevant also in other astrophysical contexts which have not been discussed here .",
    "these include , for example , the supernova explosions , the production of gamma - ray bursts , the acceleration ultra - high - energy cosmic rays , the production of neutrinos , and the emission of gravitational waves ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "being the only places in the universe in which we can observe and study physical processes in magnetic fields of such extreme intensity , axps / sgrs will certainly remain among the most interesting astrophysical objects for theoretical studies and for observations with the experimental facilities that will become available in the coming years .",
