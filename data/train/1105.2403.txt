    "multi - gap superconductivity arises when the gap amplitudes on different sheets of the fermi surface are radically disparate , e.g. due to different dimensionality of the bands for the usual phonon - mediated pairing , as is the case in mgb@xmath2,@xcite or due to the repulsive pairing interaction , as it appears to be the case in recently discovered iron - pnictides.@xcite the other examples of multi - gap materials include osb@xmath2 , iron silicides such as lu@xmath2fe@xmath3si@xmath4 , chalcogenides ( nbse@xmath2 ) , but also the conventional superconductors such as pb when reduced to nanoscale.@xcite    in a strong magnetic field all superconducting condensates form normal - metal voids , as an intermediate state before superconductivity is fully destroyed .",
    "these normal domains tend to _ merge _ in type - i superconductors in order to minimize their positive surface energy , whereas in type - ii superconductors they have negative surface energy and _ split _ into quantized vortices .",
    "however , in 2005 babaev and speight predicted the so - called semi - meissner state in two - band superconductors,@xcite the state with localized regions of high and low vortex densities , arising from short - range repulsive while long - range attractive vortex - vortex interaction .",
    "this vortex behavior was recently visualized by moshchalkov _",
    "et al._,@xcite in the form of stripes and clusters of vortices in a single - crystal mgb@xmath2 .",
    "such vortex configurations stemming from the long - range attractive vortex behavior ( see also ref . for review ) are clearly very important in the field of superconductivity , but they also present a bridge between solid - state physics and soft condensed matter , where systems with competing interactions are of abiding interest.@xcite    to date the matter of competing vortex interactions in two - band superconductors has not been conclusively settled although recent years saw a surge of activities in this field . the original prediction in ref .",
    "concerns only the case when one band is type - i and the other type - ii , although it is unclear how different types of behavior between bands in @xmath5-space ( not real space ) can be discerned . ref . demonstrated such vortex behavior in systems where just one band is fully superconducting , and the other superconducts only due to direct coupling .",
    "_ found different types of possible vortex - vortex interactions and several resulting exciting vortex configurations , but did not provide a universal criterion to _ a priori _ determine the type of vortex interaction.@xcite finally some authors expressed scepticism to nonmonotonic vortex interaction ; geyer _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the normal metal / two - gap superconductor surface energy close to @xmath6 depends just on a single ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter @xmath1 , and thus only either repulsive ( type - ii ) or attractive ( type - i ) vortex - vortex interaction is possible.@xcite this point was later reenforced by kogan and schmalian.@xcite",
    "in this paper we derive criteria for the appearance of non - monotonic interaction of vortices in two - gap systems described by the standard gl model .",
    "our analysis is based on the two - band gl theory , _ but with correct microscopic parameters _ obtained either from theoretical band structure calculations or by fitting the experimental penetration depth or specific heat data by the so - called @xmath7-model @xcite .",
    "we begin from the gl energy functional , which comprises single - band contributions from both condensates , the coupling term , and the energy of the magnetic field in and around the sample : @xmath8 here the two cooper - pair condensates are described by the order parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , * h * is the applied magnetic field and * h * the net one .",
    "the josephson coupling term provides the ` minimal coupling ' , well described in literature .",
    "the temperature enters the energy expression through @xmath11 , linearly dependent on the temperature term @xmath12.@xcite the expansion leading to the gl theory is strictly valid only in the immediate vicinity of @xmath6 , but we use this theory at somewhat lower temperatures as well , arguing that gl theory qualitatively well describes important physics away from @xmath6 ( as was demonstrated at many prior instances ) .",
    "finally , it was shown in ref .",
    ", that standard two - band gl theory contains incomplete terms that estimate @xmath13 with precision to @xmath14 .",
    "the authors reduce the theory by eliminating latter terms , which results in a single coherence length for both order parameters of a two - band superconductor .",
    "this is however not a correct physical picture at low temperatures , and two coherence lengths for the two - band superconductors can be recovered even in the gl domain in the extended model of ref .  .",
    "unfortunately , the latter model is presented in the absence of magnetic field . to be able to capture all the essential physics , at least qualitatively ,",
    "we base our study on the compromise standard gl model .",
    "note however that our further explained semi - analytic approach can be applied to _ any improved form _ of the energy functional for two - band superconductors .",
    "we next calculate the vortex - vortex interaction in a similar fashion to ref . but within a correct microscopic framework . the parameters in eq .",

    "this directly illustrates that coupling of two ( nominally ) type - ii condensates may lead to a type - i behavior of the coupled system !",
    "iii ) in eq . ( [ eint1b ] ) for single band superconductors ,",
    "it is clear that if @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , the interaction potential @xmath113 will be repulsive ( attractive ) . for two - band superconductors , eq .",
    "( [ eint2b ] ) shows that the relevant parameters are @xmath114 , rather than the nominal gl parameters @xmath115 for each condensate .",
    "if either @xmath116 or @xmath117 are below @xmath118 , the long - range vortex interaction is attractive ( type - i like ) .",

    "iv ) in the presence of coupling , the long - range behavior of both @xmath68 depends exponentially on _ the smallest _ of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , in the coupled case , we can define not only a single penetration depth for both bands , but also the order parameters for both condensates exhibit _ the same decay _ at large distances which implies a joint coherence length @xmath121 .",
    "the analysis in the previous subsection brings us to the discussion of the real criterion for the attractive / repulsive nature of the vortex interaction . in the single - band case ,",
    "the changing sign of the normal domain - superconductor surface energy @xmath122 at the bogomolnyi point is a correct criterion .",
    "however , in the two - band case and for large vortex - vortex distance , the bogomolnyi point is determined by a single valued @xmath123 , which is not necessarily where the surface energy of the normal domain ( vortex ) changes sign !",
    "the sign of the energy of the interfaces between normal - metal domains and the superconductor determines whether merging of those domains is energetically favorable or not ( i.e. if the superconductor is type - i or type - ii ) . in the case of vortices , the smallest possible normal domains , the positive vortex - superconductor surface energy therefore means that the vortices should repel ( at least at short distances ) in order to avoid the formation of a giant vortex .",
    "we here show how to calculate the normal - superconducting interface energy and by that predict the type of the short - range vortex - vortex interaction .",
    "we follow a similar approach to that of ref .  , but we take into account the josephson coupling and the temperature dependence of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameters , within a correct microscopical framework .",
    "namely , we consider the interface between normal and superconducting region as the @xmath124-plane at @xmath125 and calculate the surface energy @xmath122 using the one - dimensional gl functional at the thermodynamic critical field @xmath126 , which reads @xmath127 \\nonumber \\\\ -2\\gamma",

    "the thermodynamic critical field of the coupled system @xmath126 is obtained from the condition that the gl functional in eq .",

    "we supplement our argumentation by numerically obtained vortex - vortex interaction potentials ( in a similar fashion as in ref . ) .",

    "<S> we describe a semi - analytic approach to the two - band ginzburg - landau theory , which predicts the behavior of vortices in two - band superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the character of the short - range vortex - vortex interaction is determined by the sign of the normal domain - superconductor interface energy , in analogy with the conventional differentiation between type - i and type - ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also show that the long - range interaction is determined by a _ modified _ ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath0 , different from the standard @xmath1 of a bulk superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the possibility for non - monotonic vortex - vortex interaction , which is _ temperature - dependent _ , and can be _ further tuned _ by alterations of the material on the microscopic scale . </S>"
