    "we show that the methods developed for simulating fermionic and bosonic systems with ions can save a large amount of resources in terms of gates with respect to other platforms .",
    "this demonstrates that trapped ions are a promising quantum technology for a wide variety of quantum simulations , including high energy physics , condensed matter , or quantum chemistry .",

    "ions are charged particles that can be confined either in penning traps  @xcite or radio - frequency ( rf ) paul traps  @xcite .",

    "prototypical cases of two - qubit gates that can be realized in trapped ions are : the cirac - zoller gate  @xcite , corresponding basically to a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate , and the mlmer - srensen ( ms ) gate  @xcite , that is the basic building block for our quantum simulations of fermions and bosons in trapped ions .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section  [ fermionsbosons ] , we summarize the method for simulating fermionic systems in trapped ions introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we propose a novel approach with an ultrafast gate that may speed up the implementation of the method . in section  [ feasibility ]",
    "we assess the efficiency of the method in terms of the number of elementary gates and realization time , and show that it can be highly advantageous as compared to other platforms .",

    "quantum simulations appear as the technique that will allow us to calculate the time evolution of interacting fermionic and bosonic theories in an optimized way  @xcite .      here , we show how a linear paul trap can efficiently encode the dynamics of interacting fermionic and bosonic systems using digital - analog techniques  @xcite .",
    "our method consists of three steps , see fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] .",
    "firstly , we map the hamiltonian @xmath31 of @xmath32 interacting fermionic modes , via the jordan - wigner transformation , to a sum of nonlocal spin operators .",
    "the second step consists in decomposing the evolution operator associated with @xmath31 via a trotter expansion .",
    "this yields products of exponentials , each of them associated with one of the nonlocal spin operators appearing in the hamiltonian . finally , we implement these exponentials , up to local rotations , on a set of @xmath32 two - level ions with a small number of laser pulses , by means of two mlmer - srensen gates and a local gate .",
    "these three steps produce an efficient protocol employing just polynomial resources",
    ". a trapped ion implementation of the presented method will be able to simulate nonlinear and long - range fermionic and bosonic interactions for two - dimensional and three - dimensional problems .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the time evolution associated with the nonlocal spin operators , which contains a large number of pauli operators , can nevertheless be efficiently realized ( see the third step in fig  [ fig : protocol ] ) . for about  @xmath33 or more particles",
    ", one could already overcome classical computers in a fermionic quantum simulation .",
    "the requirements for efficient quantum simulation of fermionic or spin models may also be developed in superconducting circuits as recently shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "mapping of the hamiltonian @xmath31 , where each @xmath34 corresponds to a fermionic operator , @xmath32 is the total number of fermionic modes , and @xmath35 is the highest order of the many - body interaction , using the jordan - wigner transformation , to a sum of tensor products of spin operators .",
    "@xmath36 trotter expansion of the resulting evolution .",

    "we point out that the use of local rotations allows one to obtain an arbitrary fermionic hamiltonian .",
    "while the ms gates correspond to an interaction upon all the ions , the intermediate one is a local rotation applied on just one ion . to simulate a dynamics of fermions coupled to bosons , one would substitute the local gate @xmath38 by @xmath39 $ ] , resulting in a linear coupling of bosons to a quadratic fermionic operator . ]      the same protocol presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol ] can be extended in order to include bosonic modes in the formalism . in this sense",
    ", the only requirement corresponds to the replacement of the gate @xmath40 by @xmath41 in the third step of the algorithm .",
    "the possibility to implement this kind of interactions in a quantum simulator generalizes the kind of theories to be simulated .",
    "some examples are the holstein model  @xcite in condensed matter physics or nontrivial extensions of quantum chemistry including the molecular vibronic degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of bosonic modes paves the way to the implementation of quantum field theories in trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "quantum field theories are among the deepest theories of nature describing the behavior of fundamental particles . for example , quantum electrodynamics is the theory governing the interaction between fermionic charged particles through the electromagnetic field . a simplified version of the hamiltonian describing the interaction between fermions and bosons , when restricted to the case of @xmath42 dimensions and scalar particles , can be written as  @xcite @xmath43 here , the fermionic field @xmath44 is @xmath45 with @xmath46 @xmath47 fermionic ( antifermionic ) operators obeying the anticommutation rules @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the bosonic electromagnetic field @xmath50 is @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 obey @xmath54 = \\delta(k - k')$ ] .    here",
    ", several approximations can be considered .",
    "for instance , an adequate discretization in the number of fermionic and bosonic modes will make the implementation feasible with current technology .",
    "we point out that the kind of terms that will arise from hamiltonian  ( [ qed ] ) simply correspond to interactions between fermions and fermions with bosons , and each of them is implementable with the previously commented techniques . in the spin language",
    ", the different terms appearing will be nonlocal spin operators coupled linearly to the position operator of the bosons .",
    "the interaction between fermions will arise through the coupling to the bosons , that will act as mediators .",
    "one possibility to improve the gate time in our protocol for simulating fermionic and bosonic systems in trapped ions is the following .",
    "it can be realized that the hamiltonian of the ms gate used in our protocol , @xmath55 may be substituted by the hamiltonian @xmath56 associated with a dynamics that we name _",
    "ultrafast multi - qubit _",
    "( umq ) gate for reasons that will be clarified later .",
    "label 1 denotes here the ion acted upon by the local gate applied between the two ms gates . doing this substitution",
    "the protocol remains exactly the same , given that the terms not involving ion 1 cancel out after the two ms gates .",
    "notice that the label 1 can refer to any spin which appears in the nonlocal spin interaction .",
    "accordingly , one may just consider the umq gate for our protocol instead of the ms gate .",
    "that is , one would implement the umq gate pair by pair .",
    "this can be a significant advantage , given that unitary evolutions associated with hamiltonians of the kind @xmath57 can be done in trapped ions with resonant gates  @xcite , saving orders of magnitude in the gate time with respect to dispersive gates like the ms gate .",
    "current proposals consider applying the resonant gates to neighboring ions , and to couple distant ions one can employ shuttling  @xcite .",
    "we consider a setup analogous to the one in ref .",
    "the shuttling time will depend on the specific experiment and the kind of protocol , either adiabatic or making use of reverse engineering techniques .",
    "thus , for say 10 ions , one will need 10 resonant gates in the new protocol per ms gate in the old protocol , to implement the umq gate .",
    "however , given that the resonant gates can be done about 3 orders of magnitude faster , one may reduce the total protocol time by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "for the relevant case of 40 ions , which would simulate 40 fermionic modes , one may reduce the simulator time a factor of 25 using the umq gate with respect to the ms - based protocol . instead of shuttling the ions , a further possibility is to couple distant sites via swap gates with just a linear resource overhead  @xcite .",
    "we assess now the feasibility of our protocols for implementing fermionic and bosonic dynamics in trapped ions by giving illustrative examples .",
    "we calculate the number of entangling gates needed when using ms gates , and compare it with other implementations that use controlled - not ( cnot ) gates  @xcite .",
    "we show that in trapped ions one may reduce the number of necessary multiqubit gates by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "we consider a trapped - ion quantum simulation of a @xmath58 site fermionic lattice with two modes per site ( @xmath59 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquette ] .",
    "we propose to map this lattice onto a 40-ion string in a paul trap .",
    "developments of an ion trap allowing for up to 1000 ions in a string , for quantum simulations , and quantum interfaces , have been recently published  @xcite .",
    "the total number of fermionic modes in our proposed system , i.e. , 40 , makes it be in the limit of the computational power of classical computers .",
    "thus , this quantum simulator is one example of a relevant physical problem that trapped ions could solve efficiently while being hard for classical devices .",
    "we compare now the total number of entangling gates needed both in our trapped ion implementation , making use of ms gates , and in other quantum optics platforms , that may employ cnot gates .",
    "we point out that to implement an @xmath32-body spin operator , one typically needs @xmath60 cnot gates , while , with our protocol , in general one just needs 2 ms gates .",
    "we consider the hubbard model in the lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquette ] .",
    "the system hamiltonian is @xmath61 where @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "let us now make a counting of the number of gates needed for this quantum simulation .",

    "( [ hubbard40modesmodel ] ) that we consider are tunneling terms in a row , see fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquette ] . after applying the jordan - wigner transformation , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ,",
    "... , we have , e.g. , @xmath66 .",
    "this kind of term employs 4 ms gates ( two per summand ) , and given that we have 16 of these terms , with two spins per site , the total number of entangling gates needed is 128 ms gates . the second kind of terms in eq .",
    "( [ hubbard40modesmodel ] ) are the tunneling terms in a column which are nonlocal in the spin - operator encoding . for example , the term @xmath67 .",
    "the number of ms gates of this kind of term is @xmath68 . finally , the last type of term in eq .",
    "( [ hubbard40modesmodel ] ) is the onsite coulomb repulsion , @xmath69 . in the spin language we have ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the excited state of ion @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ innsbrucktrap ] ) , which requires just one entangling gate , with hamiltonian @xmath73 .",
    "the number of two - qubit gates associated with this kind of term is 20 .",
    "summarizing , the number of entangling gates , including ms gates , for implementing the hubbard model in our 40-mode lattice is 268 gates per trotter step . for 10 trotter steps",
    ", this will give a total number of 2680 gates .",
    "we want to compare now the previous calculation with fermionic implementations using digital simulations in other quantum platforms . in those cases in which the ms gate is not available , and",
    "one has to employ , e.g. , cnot gates , for each nonlocal spin operator composed of @xmath32 pauli matrices one needs @xmath60 cnot gates  @xcite , instead of 2 ms gates .",
    "accordingly , the number of cnot gates for the tunneling terms in a row is @xmath74 for each spin , 384 in total .",
    "moreover , the number of cnot gates for the tunneling terms in a column is @xmath75 per spin , 1320 in total .",
    "the number of entangling gates for the onsite coulomb repulsion is still the same as before , 20 .",
    "accordingly , the total number of entangling gates per trotter step is in this case 1724 . for 10 trotter steps ,",
    "the total number of gates in implementations making use of cnot gates and not of ms gates is of about 17000 .",
    "this is almost one order of magnitude larger than for the trapped ion case .",
    "accordingly , one realizes that trapped - ion implementations , making use of ms gates , are a highly versatile tool for implementing a fermionic dynamics .",
    "even though one can simulate free fermions efficiently with cold atoms , given that in this case the atoms can be fermionic , it is much more difficult to have nonlinearities and interactions among them than with our trapped - ion methods .",
    "accordingly , we consider our protocol for implementing fermions in trapped ions as complementary to cold atoms and optical lattices .    we make now a rough estimate of the total time of the protocol : for a ms gate time of about 20 @xmath76s , and for @xmath772500 entangling gates , assuming the single qubit gates will contribute a small fraction of the total evolution period , this will give a total protocol time of about 50 ms .",
    "this is on the order of magnitude of the decoherence time in some current experiments for digital quantum simulators  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , near - future improvements may allow to reach similar numbers of gates in the protocol inside the coherence time .",
    "for a large number , @xmath32 , of ions in the trap , the protocol may take a longer time for nonresonant gates due to the reduced ion - phonon coupling , that scales as @xmath78 .",
    "the time of the ms gate will then increase by a factor of @xmath79 , for @xmath32 ions with respect to 2 , i.e. , for 40 ions a factor of 20 .",
    "this will give a total time of the protocol of 1 s , which is , on the other hand , about the decoherence time for some quantum - simulation experiments with trapped ions , e.g. , with ytterbium  @xcite . a further possibility to reduce the time of the protocol , and in consequence increase",
    "the number of gates that may be realized in an experiment , is to substitute the standard dispersive ms gates by a umq gate based on resonant entangling gates , like in refs .",
    "@xcite , as we pointed out in sec .",
    "[ fermionsbosons ] .",
    "given that we just need to apply @xmath32 of these gates per ms gate as shown in previous section , and we can reduce the time of each gate by about 3 orders of magnitude , for @xmath80 one could reduce the time of the protocol a factor 25 , well below the decoherence time .",
    "an optimization of resonant entangling gates for simulating fermions in trapped ions may significantly improve these resources .",
    "a further issue is the fact that each single or two - qubit gate will have a finite error that will accumulate when applying many of them . on the other hand , recent estimations point to the fact that ms gates may be done in the near future with fidelity errors smaller than 10@xmath81  @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , reaching about thousands of gates in a single quantum simulation experiment with trapped ions , without error correction , may be a realistic possibility .      including bosons in the fermionic trapped - ion simulation , as explained in sec .",
    "[ fermionsbosons ] , may give a significant computational power increase .",
    "from a numerical point of view , when one considers phonon generation , the hilbert space dimension of the simulated system can grow fast even with a small number of fermionic sites .",
    "notice that the dynamics of a bosonic hilbert space can be approximated with truncation at some level of the number of bosonic quanta .",
    "therefore , the amount of computational resources that one needs in order to obtain a given fidelity for the quantum state of the simulation increases with the amount of bosonic excitations .",
    "given that the bosonic part is analog in our formalism , just with 10 ions , 10 motional modes , and up to 7 phonons per mode , one would reach a total hilbert space dimension of @xmath82 , which is at the limit of the fastest classical computers .",
    "an example of fermionic - bosonic simulation is the holstein model  @xcite .",
    "the holstein hamiltonian is given  by @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator at the fermion site @xmath72 , and @xmath85 is the phonon annihilation ( creation ) operator at site @xmath72 .",
    "the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath8 are respectively a nearest - neighbor ( nn ) site hopping for the fermions , fermion - phonon coupling and phononic free energy .",
    "the model describes a fermion - phonon correlated system , which has been proven to be of great importance for a large number of solid state systems . in condensed - matter systems",
    ", the correlation between the presence of fermions in a lattice and distortions of the latter can produce the creation of polarons : fermions and phonons can no more be regarded as independent particles . the lattice distortion surrounding",
    "the fermion can have different size depending on the intensity of the fermion - phonon interaction .",
    "for strong coupling , the fermions can become trapped , with interesting changes of global transport properties .",
    "we can map via jordan - wigner transformation the original hamiltonian into a coupled spin - boson system .",
    "the mapped hamiltonian has the form @xmath88 to implement an @xmath32-site holstein lattice in a trapped - ion chain , we make use of @xmath89 ions .",
    "the first @xmath32 ions will encode the dynamics of the fermionic sites , while the last passive ion is used to displace the motional modes .",
    "the first term can be rewritten as @xmath90 .",
    "one can implement in a single ms gate the interactions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , for each couple of nearest - neighbor ions .",
    "one additional , combined red - blue sideband interaction can implement the interaction of each ion of the chain with a particular normal mode @xmath93 .",
    "finally , driving the passive ion in the chain , one can realize the free displacement of the motional modes in the model .    in summary , with ten sites , in order to perform one trotter step",
    ", one will need @xmath94 ms local gates to implement the nn fermionic interactions , @xmath95 red - blue detuned sidebands for having the fermionic - bosonic interactions , and @xmath95 pulses to couple each normal mode to the passive ion .",
    "therefore , a number of 38 gates per trotter step , and considering 10 trotter steps , gives a total number of 380 gates , which is foreseeable in the near future .",
    "in general , for the total @xmath32-mode hamiltonian , one will need @xmath96 ms gates and @xmath60 red - blue detuned sidebands per trotter step .",
    "this is a number of gates linear in @xmath32 .",
    "this should be compared with the resources needed for a classical simulation of this dynamics : when the number of bosonic excitations per mode exceeds 7 , the associated hilbert space will have a dimension larger than @xmath97 , overcoming the capacities of classical computers for even small @xmath32 . regarding the total time of the protocol , for 10 fermionic and bosonic modes",
    ", one will need 11 ions , and the ms gate will employ a time about 5 times longer than for just 2 ions , while the red and blue sidebands will take a time about 2 times longer .",
