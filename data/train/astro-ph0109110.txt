    "the current standard model of the universe is the friedmann - walker expanding universe . the major factors which led to the adoption of the expanding universe model in the late 1920 s and early 1930 s were :    1 .",
    "the distribution of the galaxies is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the galaxies are receding from us with velocities proportional to their distances .",
    "the first factor is undoubtedly correct .",
    "observations show that the galaxies on a large enough scale are distributed homogeneously and isotropically .",
    "however , the recession of the galaxies was based on the hubble redshift which remains an assumption .",
    "initially , the redshift was assumed due to the doppler shift process and , later , to the expansion of space .",
    "thus , the hubble redshift could still be due to a different process .",
    "if another process is responsible for the hubble redshift , the theoretical picture becomes quite different .",
    "the universe would be static rather than expanding .",
    "this , of course , is only a conjecture at this point but it is an important first step .    a few cosmologists , notably jaakkola  @xcite and laviolette  @xcite , have proposed that the universe is static .",
    "jaakkola has argued that the universe is static and in an equilibrium state .",
    "laviolette has shown that the observational data of the mid-1980 s is more consistent with the static universe model than the expanding universe models and proposed a new process for the hubble redshift .",
    "i also proposed  @xcite that the universe was static in 1994 .",
    "however , at that time , the observational data was not good enough to convincingly prove that the universe was static .",
    "on the other hand , sandage and lubin  @xcite have recently concluded from surface brightness observations of elliptical galaxies that the universe is expanding .",
    "this paper is equally divided between theory and observation .",
    "the theoretical part is required to derive the hubble redshift and predict the mass density of the universe .",
    "the observational section is also large in order to adequately describe and analyze the observational data sets .",
    "consequently , the paper is organized as follows :    1 .",
    "the static universe hypothesis is developed .",
    "this is an important first step in the scientific method  @xcite .",
    "new physics is introduced in order to derive the hubble redshift .",
    "new physics in this instance appears required since all previous attempts to derive the hubble redshift using current physics appear to have failed .",
    "the source of the mass - energy of elementary particles is determined .",
    "in particular , an average mass density of the universe consistent with observation is predicted .",
    "4 .   the size and physical nature of the universe are discussed .",
    "this section contains another argument for a static and equilibrium universe .",
    "a new hubble redshift process is derived for a static universe .",
    "this process applies to both photons and mass particles .",
    "a theoretical solution to the anomalous dimming of supernovae is proposed based on a new process involving time - dilation of the supernovae light curve .",
    "an equilibrium energy process is proposed for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation field in a static universe .",
    "the deductions of the static universe hypothesis are compared to the observations , using four different global tests of the space - time metric .",
    "rather than argue for a static universe hypothesis as in the introduction , it is better to develop the hypothesis based on physical logic . thus , the hypothesis of a static universe in an equilibrium state follows directly from the perfect cosmological principle ( pcp ) which was proposed in 1948 by bondi and gold  @xcite ( also hoyle  @xcite ) .",
    "the pcp says the universe looks the same from any location at any time .",
    "bondi and gold based the reality of the pcp on the following fundamental assumption :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given that the unrestricted repeatability of all experiments is a fundamental axiom of physical science , this implies that the outcome of an experiment is not affected by the location and time at which it is carried out . _",

    "however , they believed that if it does not hold , the variability of the physical laws becomes so wide that one can no longer use local physics in the distant universe without relying on arbitrary principles for the extrapolation of local physics .",
    "conversely , if the pcp holds in the universe , we can confidently base our results on the permanent validity of all our experiments and observations .",
    "therefore , they concluded that we should proceed theoretically assuming the pcp is true since this is the only basis permitting progress without further arbitrary assumptions .    at the present time , the pcp must be considered an even stronger theoretical principle since the invariance of the physical constants  @xcite and the laws of physics are confirmed both by local experiments and by distant observations of the universe .    from the pcp , bondi and gold at",
    "first expected the universe to be static . however , because of the observed redshifts of the galaxies and also the active state of universe , they believed the universe must be expanding and thermodynamically in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "then , in order to maintain a stationary state of the universe even though the universe was expanding , they were forced to assume that matter is created in the voids left by the expansion of the space between the galaxies .",
    "they referred to this new model of the universe as the steady state universe .    from today",
    "s perspective , i believe their initial expectation that the universe was static was correct but that their further assumptions leading to an expanding universe with matter creation were both unnecessary and incorrect .",
    "however , in 1948 when they developed the pcp , the steady state universe was possibly the only logical way to proceed .",
    "currently , based on the derivation of a new process for the hubble redshift in a static universe , many of the elements of a static universe are understood . in any case , the static universe hypothesis can now be tested since precision observational data is now available from the hubble space telescope and the new , large ground telescopes .",
    "the basic problem is to develop a new process for the hubble redshift in a static universe .",
    "since the hubble redshift has been known for over 70 years , a large number of attempts have been made to derive a physical process for the hubble redshift in a static universe .",
    "the requirements for the hubble redshift process are :    1 .",
    "the shift in frequency is strictly proportional to the frequency .",
    "2 .   all electromagnetic frequencies are equally affected .",
    "the redshift is proportional to the distance .",
    "the first two requirements are satisfied by the doppler process but , of course , it is not the doppler process which is now held responsible for the redshift but the expansion of the universe .",
    "the expansion fits all of the above requirements .",
    "gravitation is the only other known process with the same properties .",
    "so , without introducing a new force , gravitation is an obvious candidate for the hubble redshift .",
    "however , in current physics , gravitation is too weak a force to cause the hubble redshift .",
    "this is the current dilemma if new physics is not introduced .      as a more fundamental and comprehensive viewpoint in physics ,",
    "i propose _ the universe is a pure wave system consisting of a large number of wave modes .",
    "_ this is a new paradigm that was inferred from the universal occurrence of wave phenomena in physics and the consistency of the paradigm with the basic laws of physics . from this concept of a wave system",
    ", the existence of particles , fields and quantum effects  @xcite may be derived .    because the wave modes have very small amplitudes , i assume the wave modes can be modeled using the classical linear wave equation @xmath7 where the parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are the tension and ( linear ) mass density respectively .",
    "the parameters are not fixed but can vary subject to local constraints . and , because the parameters can vary , the wave modes can exchange energy through parametric interactions .",
    "the wave modes can be shown to constructively interfere and produce localized peaks surrounded by large regions of destructive interference .",
    "it is then hypothesized that these localized peaks are the elementary particles . as derived later ,",
    "the wave system becomes a deeply bound system when the localized peaks are formed .",
    "the system then appears to consist only of stable , interacting constructive interference peaks , indistinguishable in properties from the observed elementary particles .",
    "a symmetry argument of h. giorgi  @xcite  proves that the wave system exists .",
    "given a system which is infinite and linear and where the laws of physics are space and time translation invariant , giorgi argues that the modes of oscillation of a system are determined by the representations of the space and time translation groups . since",
    "a solution of each representation is a complex exponential in space and time respectively , a standing wave system is formed , given by @xmath10 .    the symmetry proof must apply to the universe since the properties of the universe match very closely the requirements for the symmetry .",
    "first , the universe is a very large if not infinite system with linear responses at the level of basic laws . and second , the exact time and translational invariance of the laws of nature has been experimentally confirmed .    c. vassallo  @xcite reaches similar conclusions .",
    "he also finds that fields which are invariant to space and time translation must vary as @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , he finds that any bounded wave field which has sources can be represented by normal modes which do not have sources .",
    "this is a significant theorem .",
    "it suggests that a system of bounded normal modes can bootstrap initial sources to produce the normal modes .",
    "the stability of the wave system is based on the following two principles :    1 .",
    "the frequency is reduced if the mass density and tension are larger at the wave mode peaks .",
    "2 .   as the number of elementary particles mutually interacting increases , the frequency increases .    to apply the first principle , assume the mass density and tension are proportional to the local energy density of the wave system . then",
    ", the frequency of a wave mode will decrease when the constructive interference of the wave modes produces high energy concentrations at the peaks of the wave mode ( see equation  [ eq:6l ] and accompanying discussion ) .",
    "as an example of this principle , consider a string vibrating in it s lowest frequency mode .",
    "when lead weights are placed at the peaks of the vibration , the frequency is reduced .",
    "similarly , when the tension is increased at the peaks , the frequency is reduced .",
    "since the energy density at a peak is proportional to the number of wave modes @xmath11 constructively interfering , the decrease in frequency of the wave modes is very large .",
    "if the natural frequency of the wave system without constructive interference is @xmath12 , complete constructive interference reduces the frequency to @xmath13    since the number of wave modes increases as the average distance between particles increases , the frequency could go to zero as @xmath14 increases without limit .",
    "however , by the second principle , there is a lower bound on the frequency determined by the number of interacting particles in the universe .",
    "this frequency is given by the simple eigenvalue equation proposed by chen  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the effective number of particles interacting and the interaction constant , @xmath17 , between any two particles is constant .",
    "this eigenvalue system is remarkable since it has only two discrete frequencies , one degenerate with @xmath18 modes given by @xmath19 and the other equal to @xmath20 , the frequency of a single element and also the minimum frequency .",
    "equation  [ eq : chen ] is the approximate eigenvalue solution to the interactions between all the particles @xmath21 in the universe .",
    "this assumes that in the universe the interactions between particles have the same average strength .    a stable frequency of the wave system",
    "is attained when the wave mode frequency , @xmath22 , and the particle frequency , @xmath19 , are the same .",
    "the particle frequency may be estimated from equation  [ eq : chen ] .",
    "let @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the mean absorption distance and is equal to @xmath25 ( see section  [ sec : hrp ] ) .",
    "@xmath26 estimates the minimum frequency , @xmath12 .",
    "then , assuming @xmath27 cm ( h = 50 km / sec / mpc ) and @xmath28 particles , the stable frequency is @xmath29 hertz .    as a first approximation ,",
    "the wave system vibrates at this single frequency . in the second approximation , the single frequency",
    "is split into two frequencies by the interactions between the particles .",
    "the higher frequency is hypothesized to correspond to the proton and the lower frequency to the electron .",
    "this eigenvalue theory is consistent with the fact that these are the only stable mass particles .",
    "the number of normal modes is an important parameter in the wave system theory because the properties of the wave system depend on constructive interference . in particular , the ratio between the electrostatic force and the gravitational force is proportional to the number of modes interfering .",
    "this can be shown as follows : for constructive interference , the intensity , @xmath30 , at a particle is proportional to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the amplitude of each mode of vibration .",
    "it is assumed that the force of gravitation is due to the @xmath33 terms since gravitation is a small effect which is always attractive . on the other hand ,",
    "the electrostatic force is assumed proportional to the @xmath34 terms . for @xmath14 on the order of @xmath35 , the electrostatic force is @xmath35 times larger than the gravitational force and can be either plus or minus .",
    "it would be natural to assume that the intensity of the wave modes at a particle is primarily due to the interference terms .",
    "however , the intensity at a particle is given by @xmath36 since the @xmath37 terms in equation  [ n:1 ] cancel on the average at an elementary particle , this is understandable because the electrostatic energy is equally plus and minus at a particle .",
    "since only the squared terms remain , the mass energy of elementary particles is then purely gravitational in origin rather than overwhelmingly electrostatic .      in order to determine the forces which occur in the wave system",
    ", the wave system equation must be solved for small changes in the variable parameters .",
    "this assumes that all forces are due to changes in the parameters .",
    "since the equilibrium solution of the wave system equation is needed , the space dependent eigenvalue equation will be used .",
    "this is derived from equation  [ eq:1 ] by separation of variables and is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the separation constant .    for small spatial variations in the parameters , the perturbative solution of equation  [ eq:3 ]",
    "is given by @xmath40 where is the unperturbed frequency , @xmath41 and @xmath42 the average mass density and tension and @xmath43 is the size of the system .",
    "this equation shows that @xmath44 decreases when @xmath9 and @xmath45 are larger at the constructive interference peaks .",
    "equation  [ eq:57 ] may be simplified as follows : first , by noting that the last two terms are equal .",
    "second , by setting @xmath46 and @xmath47 and taking the square root .",
    "then , the perturbed frequency is approximated by @xmath48    now assume there is only a single particle in the system and the particle or constructive interference peak has a linear width equal to the wavelength , @xmath49 . to simplify the nomenclature , set @xmath50 . then , @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass of the particle .",
    "integrating equation  [ eq:5l ] , @xmath54 note : @xmath55 integrates to @xmath56 since @xmath57 is a constructive interference peak which only exists over one wavelength within the much larger integration distance , @xmath43 . without the constructive interference peak , @xmath58 . with the constructive interference peak , @xmath59 , the stable frequency of the wave system .    setting @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in equation  [ eq:6l ]",
    ", we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the energy density ( still a function of x ) .",
    "then the force required to move a mass particle is given by @xmath65 equation  [ eq:5p ] is the `` general force equation . ''",
    "the type of force depends upon the nature of the physical process which changes @xmath64 .      in a previous paper  @xcite , i derived newton s law of gravitation from the wave system theory . because understanding gravitation on a deeper level than newtonian gravitation or , for that matter , general relativity is essential to the cosmological theories proposed in this paper , i am repeating the derivation in this paper .    to derive newton s law ,",
    "assume two protons , labeled @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are @xmath68 cm apart .",
    "the model for gravitation is as follows : a wave mode originating at @xmath66 interacts with @xmath67 .",
    "quantitatively , the gravitational force can be calculated from equation  [ eq:5p ] .",
    "the first step is to derive the energy density of a single wave mode at @xmath67 as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "it is assumed that the initial energy density , @xmath64 , of a single normal mode is @xmath69 times the energy density at a proton where @xmath14 is the number of normal modes .",
    "furthermore , the natural assumption in three - dimensional space is that @xmath64 decreases as @xmath70 . but",
    "differentiating @xmath64 with respect to @xmath68 , the force varies as @xmath71 .",
    "this is obviously an incorrect result since the gravitational force experimentally varies as @xmath70 ! but why is this incorrect result obtained ?    assuming the derivation of the general force law is valid , i was forced to reject the isotropic propagation of the normal modes .",
    "instead , i assumed that each wave mode propagates circularly in a plane .",
    "the energy density then varies as @xmath72 .",
    "although the circular propagation of the normal modes in planes appears physically improbable , i found that the assumption worked perfectly .    applying this assumption ,",
    "the energy density of a single normal mode is @xmath73 then , from the general force law equation  [ eq:5p ] , the gravitational force is @xmath74 where @xmath49 is the linear size of an elementary particle , i.e. , for a proton @xmath75 cm .",
    "the dependence of the gravitational force law on the size of the particle is eliminated by the following principle : _ the size of a particle is proportional to it s mass .",
    "_ this follows since the mass density must be the same for all particles ; otherwise , energy would be transferred between particles to reach a lower system eigenvalue .",
    "we can , therefore , introduce an equilibrium mass density constant for all particles , @xmath76 where the mass of a proton is @xmath77 g. the constant , @xmath78 , explains why the electron is so much smaller than the proton .    to obtain the exact form of newton s law , multiply equation  [ eq:27 m ] by @xmath79 and set @xmath80 then",
    ", the correct form of newton s law of gravitation is obtained , @xmath81 this equation has been explicitly derived only for the force between two protons . however , since the forces between pairs of particles are linearly additive , the above equation applies between objects of any mass .",
    "in addition , the number of wave modes can be calculated exactly from equation  [ eq:28 m ] for @xmath82 .",
    "solving for @xmath14 , given @xmath83 g / cm and the known constants , @xmath84 @xmath14 is an important constant in cosmology .",
    "however , it is still difficult intuitively to make sense of the concept of circular propagation of the modes in an ordinary 3-dimensional space .",
    "fortunately , i was able to prove mathematically that the wave modes propagate circularly by determining that eigenvectors corresponding to circularly propagating wave modes exist in a spherical wave system .",
    "the proof depends on the general properties of spherical wave systems and , specifically , on the assumed @xmath72 dependence of the intensity .",
    "the wave modes are actually the normal modes of the universe and theoretically completely define the universe .",
    "they are a new concept in cosmology and , in fact , their physical existence , to my knowledge , has not previously even been conjectured .",
    "the proof is as follows : begin with the classical wave equation in spherical coordinates and then consider the separated radial wave equation , @xmath85 , given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the standard method  @xcite of solving for @xmath85 is to separate equation  [ eq:75 ] into two parts @xmath88 where @xmath89 is bessel s equation of half - integral order .",
    "the solutions of @xmath89 are non - periodic except when the angular momentum eigenvector @xmath90 .",
    "since periodicity is essential for constructive interference , this is the only solution consistent with the wave system . for this unique solution ,",
    "the solution is @xmath91 however , since @xmath92 equals @xmath93 at @xmath94 , the factor @xmath95 goes to infinity at @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , only the @xmath96 part of the solution can be used .",
    "however , this is still not the required solution to the problem . since the intensity @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath97",
    ", @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "as previously discussed , this leads to an experimentally incorrect @xmath71 law for gravitation based on the general force law .",
    "nevertheless , the problem can be completely solved by noting that the above formulation of the problem assumes the tension and mass density are uniform for each wave mode .",
    "but , this is not true in the wave system since the tension and mass density parameters are assumed proportional to the local intensity of a wave mode . since the local intensity at @xmath68 for a circularly propagating wave mode is proportional to @xmath72 , we must have @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    for these parameter variations in the spherical wave equation ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath100 becomes  @xcite @xmath101 since @xmath102 .",
    "then the radial amplitude function becomes @xmath103 and the intensity of @xmath85 is then proportional to @xmath72 , as required .",
    "the modes represented by @xmath85 in equation  [ eq : r1 ] are very important physically since they are the normal modes of the universe .    what then are the characteristics of this wave model of the universe ? first , the normal modes of vibration of the universe are confined to planes orientated in different directions .",
    "each plane is excited as a single mode by a particle and the resulting wave mode propagates circularly in a plane centered on the particle .",
    "all the particles in the universe are located on the surfaces of these planes .",
    "the three dimensional character of universe is thus made up of a collection of @xmath14 vibrating planes orientated at different angles and these simulate the isotropic propagation of gravitation .",
    "consider the case of x - rays incident on a perfect crystal .",
    "experimentally , the x - ray energy density inside the crystal decreases exponentially with distance due to interactions of the x - ray photons with particles within the crystal . by analogy",
    ", it is proposed that the intensity of the wave modes are reduced exponentially by absorption and re - radiation by the mass particles .",
    "since the absorbed energy at each interaction of a wave mode is re - radiated in many directions other than the original direction of the wave mode , the intensity of the wave mode along its original direction is reduced . the gravitational force",
    "is then reduced in proportion to the decrease in intensity .",
    "using the theory developed in this paper , the absorption of the wave modes originating from a single proton can be calculated .",
    "the energy density of a single mode is given by @xmath104 where @xmath27 and @xmath105 .",
    "note : the variable @xmath106 will be used from now on for the euclidean distance and @xmath68 for the normalized distance , @xmath107 .",
    "equation  [ eq : se ] assumes that the energy density decreases as @xmath108 and is additionally reduced by a factor @xmath109 due to absorption by mass particles .",
    "then , the energy , @xmath110 , absorbed by another proton @xmath106 distant from the first is @xmath111 where @xmath112 cm , the linear size of a proton .",
    "@xmath113 is the gravitational absorption constant .",
    "the above absorption theory can be easily applied to a spherical body , such as a star .",
    "consider a spherical distribution of particles with a specific gravity @xmath114 ( @xmath115 for water with a density @xmath116 g/@xmath117 ) .",
    "the total energy absorbed from a single proton at the center of the sun is the product of @xmath110 ( equation  [ eq:37 m ] ) times the number of protons , @xmath16 , within a radius @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath118 is the number of protons per gram , @xmath119 .",
    "then , the total energy absorption is @xmath120 since the initial source energy , @xmath121 , is due to a single proton with energy @xmath122 , the proportion , @xmath123 , of the gravitational energy shielded is @xmath124 for the sun with a radius of @xmath125 cm and an average density about 10 times the specific gravity of water , the proportion of the gravitational energy absorbed is about @xmath126 .",
    "this absorption is negligible and thus confirms current practice of ignoring the possibility of any gravitational absorption for most astronomical bodies .",
    "however , for the very largest stars with radii @xmath127 cm ( @xmath128 km ) , the gravitational absorption approaches 100% .",
    "since the absorption of gravitation is central to the cosmological theories proposed in this paper , the only known observational evidence of gravitational absorption is discussed next .",
    "note that gravitational absorption is not theoretically predicted in either newtonian gravitation or in general relativity .    from the gravitational theory proposed in this paper , a small absorption of the sun s gravitation by the moon is expected .",
    "recently , the vertical acceleration at the earth s surface during a total solar eclipse in china on march 9 , 1997 was accurately measured by wang  @xcite .",
    "the measurements were corrected for the tidal effects of the sun and moon and for the earth s rotation .",
    "these corrections are accurate to a precision of @xmath129 cm / sec@xmath130 .",
    "since the results of the gravitational measurements , as described below , were quite different than expected , wang could offer no explanation of the results but still believed they were a gravitational effect , possibly indicating gravitational shielding by the moon .",
    "however , unnikrishnan  @xcite has strongly disputed the possibility of shielding of the sun s gravity by the moon based on laboratory gravitational experiments as well as astronomical and planetary observations .    at the time of total eclipse ,",
    "wang expected that the measured vertical acceleration towards the earth would increase since the acceleration towards the sun would decrease due to the gravitational absorption of the moon .",
    "contrary to this expectation , the acceleration at the time of total eclipse only shows a small decrease of less than @xmath131 cm / sec@xmath130 . instead",
    ", two much larger , nearly symmetrical decreases in the measured acceleration occurred before first contact and after fourth contact .",
    "the symmetrical decreases in acceleration are clearly shown in figure  [ f : fig1 ]   which shows the corrected measurements based on a moving average over three data points .",
    "the first , with a maximum decrease of @xmath132 cm / sec@xmath130 , begins about @xmath133 minutes before totality and ends about 50 minutes before totality . the second , with a maximum decrease of @xmath134 cm / sec@xmath130 , begins about @xmath5 minutes after totality and ends about @xmath133 minutes after totality .",
    "most important , these are the only statistically significant changes in the gravitational acceleration measured over a period of @xmath135 week before and after the eclipse .",
    "it is believed that these observed effects are due to gravitational absorption based on the derivation of newton s law of gravitation .",
    "any absorption of gravity during an eclipse of the sun by the moon would decrease the acceleration of the earth towards the sun .",
    "however , since the earth and the gravity meter are in free fall around the sun , no change in the measured acceleration should occur during a total eclipse .    but , the situation is different for the symmetrical reductions in acceleration .",
    "the sun is , of course , eclipsed at other locations before and after the total eclipse at the measurement location .",
    "because the plates of the earth are rigid , it is proposed that the reduction in acceleration of the local plate at these other locations is transmitted to the measurement location and this is what is being measured by the gravity meter .",
    "furthermore , since the strain due to the acceleration is quite small , it is likely that the local plate is freely falling because the stress opposing the acceleration is small .",
    "the reduction in acceleration during an eclipse of the sun can be calculated by the same method used previously to calculate the absorption of gravitation by the mass of the sun . in this calculation , assume a bar of matter , representing a cross section of @xmath93 cm@xmath130 through the moon , has an average specific gravity , @xmath137 .",
    "the ratio of the absorbed gravitational energy to the incident gravitational energy per proton in the sun will give the proportion of the gravitational energy which is absorbed .",
    "then , the reduction in the gravitational acceleration at the earth during a total eclipse will be given by this ratio .",
    "applying this to the solar eclipse , given that the diameter , @xmath138 , of the moon is @xmath139  cm and assuming an average specific gravity of @xmath140 , we have @xmath141 the incident gravitational energy per cm@xmath130 on the bar from one proton in the sun is @xmath142 then , @xmath143 s. since the gravitational acceleration of the sun at the earth is @xmath144 and the distance to the sun is @xmath145 cm , the reduction in acceleration at the earth during the total eclipse is given by @xmath146 since the sun was at most at an angle of about @xmath147 , the vertical acceleration is @xmath148 or @xmath149 .",
    "this result is close to the measured symmetrical reductions in acceleration .",
    "it is , i believe , a direct observational proof that gravitation is absorbed by matter and justifies using the absorption of gravitation in cosmology .",
    "also note that on the opposite side of the earth from the visible eclipse ( the dark side ) , the symmetrical accelerations should be positive , instead of negative .",
    "this provides another opportunity to test the absorption theory of gravitation proposed in this paper .",
    "the above explanation also appears to be confirmed by the comparison of the timing between the optical observations and the events as determined by the measured vertical acceleration data .",
    "table 1 shows the optical times ( in universal time ) of the eclipseevents  @xcite , the elapsed minutes from 16:00 on march 8 , 1997 from optical measurements and from acceleration based measurements .",
    "table @xmath93 + timing of solar eclipse events + march 9 , 1997    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "because the static universe hypothesis is a simple and logical deduction from the pcp and the observational data amply confirms the deductions of the static universe hypothesis , i conclude that the universe is static and in an equilibrium state .",
    "i also find that the new gravitational theory is confirmed by the cosmological observations .",
    "i acknowledge the excellent work of the observers referenced in this paper . without their precise observations , i could not have completed this work .",

    "<S> , i hypothesize that the universe is static and in an equilibrium state ( non - evolving ) as predicted by the perfect cosmological principle .    </S>",
    "<S> new physics is proposed based on the concept that the universe is a pure wave system . </S>",
    "<S> based on the new physics and assuming a static universe , new processes are derived for the hubble redshift and the cosmic background radiation field .    </S>",
    "<S> a new time - dilation process is proposed as the cause of the anomalous dimming of type ia supernovae at high @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this process is based on the hubble redshift increasing the period of the supernovae luminosity curve in the observer s rest frame . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the increase in the period reduces the luminosity of supernovae by @xmath1 . furthermore , since this process is independent of the cause of the hubble redshift , the new time - dilation process must also apply to supernovae in the expanding universe models . </S>",
    "<S> but , the expanding universe model already incorporates a time - dilation effect which applies to any object . </S>",
    "<S> thus , two time - dilation effects should be observed for supernovae . since only one time - dilation effect </S>",
    "<S> is observed for supernovae , the expanding universe model is logically falsified .    following the scientific method , i test deductions developed from the static universe hypothesis using observational data primarily from the hubble space telescope . applying four different global tests of the space - time metric </S>",
    "<S> , i find that the observational data consistently fits the static universe model and , therefore , confirms the static universe hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> the observational data also show that the average absolute magnitudes and physical radii of first - rank elliptical galaxies have not changed over the last @xmath2 to @xmath3 billion years , thereby confirming the perfect cosmological principle .    in the expanding universe models , </S>",
    "<S> the observed baryonic mass density is a factor of @xmath4 to @xmath5 lower than the predicted mass density in a flat universe . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy between theory and observation is a major problem and has resulted in many hypotheses concerning the nature of the `` missing mass . '' in the static universe model , the predicted baryonic mass density is lower by a factor of about @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the discrepancy in the baryonic mass density between theory and observation is removed .    because the static universe hypothesis is a logical deduction from the perfect cosmological principle and the hypothesis is confirmed by the observational data , </S>",
    "<S> i conclude that the universe is static and in an equilibrium state . </S>"
