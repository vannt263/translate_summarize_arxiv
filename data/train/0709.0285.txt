    "comparison with the numerical dyon solutions for large charge @xmath4 , we find some evidence that @xmath151 indeed tends to the value @xmath152 for @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath62 diverges at @xmath153 in the limit .",

    ", we obtain from the above considerations a bound for @xmath2 , @xmath158    concerning the limit @xmath159 we see that the scaled scalar charge @xmath121 tends to zero . thus in the limit there is no ( non - trivial ) scalar field in the exterior , whereas there is still an electric field .",
    "this suggests , that for @xmath159 the scaled limiting solution corresponds in the exterior to an extremal reissner - nordstrm solution with charge @xmath160 .",
    "inspection of the analytical formulae and the numerical solutions shows , that this is indeed the case .",
    "we exhibit the approach towards this limit for the metric and matter functions in fig .",
    "we note , however , that in this limit , the rn solution is approached only in the interval @xmath161 .",
    "the limiting solution is discontinuous at @xmath162 , since the metric function @xmath163 assumes the rn value @xmath164 only for @xmath165 , whereas it vanishes for @xmath166 , causing the metric to differ from the rn metric in this region .",
    "[ f-4 ]    \\(a ) ( b )    concluding , we see that the scaled limiting solution consists of two parts : an abelian exterior penney solution , saturating the bound eq .",

    "we have reconsidered dyon solutions of einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory , in the limit of vanishing higgs potential .",
    "dyon solutions then exist for arbitrarily large values of the charge .",
    "as the charge becomes large , the coupled system of einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations decomposes into a single equation for the magnetic gauge potential , and a coupled system of equations for the metric , the electric gauge potential and the scalar field .",
    "this system of equations is equivalent to the set of einstein - maxwell - scalar equations , studied by penney in a different parametrization @xcite .    in the limit @xmath5",
    ", the non - abelian dyons solutions then tend to limiting solutions , which consist of two parts , a non - abelian interior solution with flat metric , and a gravitating abelian exterior part .",
    "the interior solutions represent non - trivial solutions of the single equation for the magnetic gauge potential ( with the remaining equations trivially satisfied ) .",
    "they are regular at the origin , but diverge at the transition point , where the parts are joined .",
    "the exterior solutions , on the other hand , correspond to the exterior part of particular penney solutions , which then determine the asymptotic properties of the solutions , such as their mass and their scalar charge .",
    "it appears interesting to also consider monopole - antimonopole pairs with large electric charge . when electric charge is added to a monopole - antimonopole pair , the monopole and antimonopole experience a repulsive force and the poles move further apart @xcite .",
    "more importantly , however , the pair begins to rotate about its symmetry axis with an angular momentum @xmath167 , equal to the product of the total electric charge @xmath4 and the ( magnitude of the ) individual magnetic charge @xmath168 of the constituent magnetic poles , @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "preliminary study shows , that the presence of electric charge also leads to bifurcations of the charged monopole - antimonopole solutions , with new branches of solutions arising .",
    "considering larger values of the charge , we observe , that the values of @xmath109 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 appear to be consistent with the respective penney relations .",
    "this seems surprising though , since the penney solutions carry no angular momentum , while the charged dyons possess angular momentum @xmath169 .",
