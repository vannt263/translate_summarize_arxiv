    "<S> at high energies , the cross section of a hard exclusive process at finite scattering angle falls off as a negative power of the center - of - mass energy @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if all involved quark - gluon compositions undergo hard momentum transfers , the scaling of the fall - off is determined by the underlying valence structures of the initial and final states , known as the constituent counting rules . </S>",
    "<S> it was argued in the literature that the counting rules are a powerful tool to determine the valence degrees of freedom inside multiquark states when applied to exclusive production processes . </S>",
    "<S> however , we demonstrate that for hadrons with hidden flavors the naive application of the constituent counting rules is problematic , since it is not mandatory for all components to participate the hard scattering at the scale @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the correct scaling rules can be obtained easily by using effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> a few examples involving the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of valance quarks has played a major role in the classification of the hadronic states . </S>",
    "<S> hundreds of hadrons were discovered in experiments , and most of them are accommodated in the quark model : mesons and baryons are composed of a quark  </S>",
    "<S> antiquark pair and three quarks , respectively . here , the terminology quark refers to the valence degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> hadrons beyond such configurations are dubbed as exotic , and searching for them , in particular those with exotic quantum numbers which can not be formed by the above mentioned simple configurations , is of utmost importance in understanding the low - energy nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) because color confinement allows such color - singlet states . </S>",
    "<S> arguments state that @xmath3 tetraquark states are absent in the large @xmath4 limit ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this conclusion was challenged in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where it was argued that tetraquark states can exist in the large @xmath4 limit with narrow widths . </S>",
    "<S> this was elaborated on in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> thanks to worldwide experiments during the last decade at @xmath5 and hadron colliders , a plethora of new structures as candidates of various hadron resonances were reported with properties different from quark model expectations , and it is probable that some of them could be interpreted as exotic multiquark states . </S>",
    "<S> most of these new discoveries are in the heavy quarkonium mass region ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . among them , a milestone was the discovery of the @xmath2 by the belle collaboration in 2003 and confirmed by several other experiments later  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since then one key topic in hadron physics is the study of these observed structures .    </S>",
    "<S> taking the @xmath6 states in the charmonium mass region as an example , a number of interpretations have been proposed including normal quarkonia , hybrid states , compact multiquark states , hadro - charmonia , hadron molecules and effects due to kinematical singularities . </S>",
    "<S> most of these interpretations are based on quark model notations assuming explicitly or implicitly that the number of ( valence ) quarks is well defined , even when discussing the production of multiquarks at very high momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> then , a central question discussing the observed candidates of exotic hadrons ( including proposing new measurements of the properties of these states and searching for new structures ) is : how can one model - independently determine the valence quark - gluon composition of a hadron ? in a special case of a hadron located very close to an @xmath7-wave threshold of two other hadrons , one can in fact measure the valence hadron component since hadrons being asymptotic states can go on shell . </S>",
    "<S> however , it becomes very complicated when one tries to determine the quark - gluon components . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of confinement which tells us that quarks and gluons are not asymptotic states and can not be measured directly in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> let us define the numbers of quarks and antiquarks as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in a system with hidden flavor , @xmath10 is well defined because of baryon number conservation , while @xmath11 is not . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , one does not expect the latter to take a definite value for a given hadron in processes happening at different energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> however , the latter is the key quantity discussed in some papers in the literature , and we conclude that the conclusions of these papers are thus model - dependent and sometimes problematic . </S>",
    "<S> this argument can be made more clear by showing why the constituent `` counting rules '' fail for multiquark states in hard exclusive processes .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been argued in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the differential cross section for high energy production of multiquark states should scale with a certain power of @xmath12 , the center - of - mass energy squared , predicted based on their expected valence quark structures . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , for a generic process @xmath13 , the cross - section is argued to obey the behavior  @xcite : @xmath14 with @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath12 and @xmath16 are the conventional mandelstam variables , @xmath17 is the scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame , and @xmath18 is the number of constituents in the particle @xmath19 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 denote generic leptons , photons or hadrons including multiquarks . a fundamental particle like a quark , electron , or a photon has @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> an ordinary meson has @xmath22 , a meson - meson molecule or a compact tetraquark has @xmath23 , and a pentaquark has @xmath24 , all of which amount to @xmath25 defined before . </S>",
    "<S> the investigated processes include @xmath26 , @xmath27  @xcite , exclusive electron - positron annihilation  @xcite and so on . moreover , within the tetraquark framework , the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have argued that based on distinctive fall - offs in @xmath12 of the cross sections , it is possible to distinguish whether the tetraquarks are segregated into di - meson molecules , diquark - antidiquark pairs , or more democratically arranged four - quark states .    </S>",
    "<S> were the constituent counting rules correct , it would provide a very powerful and straightforward tool to access the valence quark structures of the exotic hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> but unfortunately as we have argued above and will show in more detail below , for hadrons with hidden - flavor quarks it is problematic to apply such a naive constituent counting rule . to be explicit </S>",
    "<S> , we will first consider a simpler example involving only ordinary mesons , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 denoting ordinary light flavor vector and pseudoscalar mesons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this reaction does not follow the naive scaling rule shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : scaling ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . then we will adopt the framework of effective field theory and point out the problems in the derivation of the misleading scaling behavior in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : scaling ] ) .    at very high energy with @xmath31 , exclusive processes can be understood in qcd perturbation theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior exists in the factorization limit and can be formally derived by matching the full theory , qcd , to an effective field theory . when factorization is applicable , one can formally separate the interactions according to the involved scales : @xmath32 =   t{\\rm exp}\\left[i\\int   d^4 x { \\cal l}_\\text{int}(x)\\right]_{>\\mu}\\times </S>",
    "<S> t{\\rm exp}\\left[i\\int d^4 x { \\cal   l}_\\text{int}(x)\\right]_{<\\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 stands for time ordering , @xmath34 is the factorization scale and for high - energy processes we should use @xmath35 in order to suppress the large logarithms in higher order contributions . </S>",
    "<S> perturbation theory at high energies allows one to express the matrix elements of heisenberg operators in terms of free local operators and the interaction terms . by including the interaction , we have : @xmath36_{>\\mu}\\times t{\\rm exp}[i\\int d^4 x { \\cal l}_\\text{int}(x)]_{<\\mu}\\right]|i\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\   & \\sim &   \\langle f|t\\left[{\\cal o } ' \\times   { \\rm exp}[i\\int d^4 x { \\cal l}_\\text{int}(x)]_{<\\mu}\\right]|i\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\   & \\equiv &   \\langle f|{\\cal o}'_{h,\\mu}|i\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we have formally integrated out the interactions above the factorization scale @xmath34 using the operator product expansion , and obtained a new set of generic low - energy effective operators @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction below @xmath34 contains no information on the @xmath38 scaling and thus the scaling behavior can be obtained by counting the pertinent number of constituents in the operator @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to include the effects due to the renormalization group and resummation of double logarithms known as sudakov logarithms . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we do not consider these effects here since the leading power behavior will be unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> an implication of the above analysis is that the @xmath12-scaling of a process at high energies is given by that contained in the operator @xmath39 , and one gets the scaling easily by identifying the number of lines attached to the vertex described by that operator , which is depicted as a circled cross in the figures in the examples to be discussed below , with the value of @xmath40 in eq .  .     with the quark - antiquark pair produced by a gluon . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and ( b ) stand for the diagram in the full theory and the eft , where the hard propagators are shrank to a point depicted as a circled cross , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is straightforward to apply the constituent counting rules to the @xmath5 annihilation into two light mesons whose typical feynman diagram is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman1 ]  ( a ) . the @xmath12 power dependence is normally determined by the constituent counting rule in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : scaling ] )  @xcite with @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being a vector and pseudoscalar meson , respectively , the differential cross section scales as @xmath42 which differs from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : scaling ] ) that would give @xmath43 because of an additional suppression factor of @xmath44 due to helicity flip . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements of the process @xmath45 by the belle collaboration  @xcite at 10.58  gev and cleo collaboration  @xcite are consistent with the above scaling in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eetovpscaling ] ) ( see also results from bes  @xcite and babar  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> however , if the vector meson is composed of a pair of quark and antiquark with the same flavor , like the @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons , the scaling behavior will be different at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we show a production mechanism in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman2 ]  ( a ) , which leads to the scaling behavior : @xmath48 as can be read off from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman2 ]  ( b ) where the effective interaction vertex has @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to point out that this production mechanism is suppressed by the fine structure constant @xmath50 and thus less important at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> but apparently at very high energies this new diagram will provide the dominant contribution and it gives a scaling rule different from the one by naively counting the number of valence quarks in the mesons  @xcite .     with both @xmath29 and @xmath30 being neutral . </S>",
    "<S> the neutral vector meson is produced via a photon . </S>",
    "<S> integrating out high - off - shell propagators , one obtains ( b ) from ( a ) . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    -0 cm    it is straightforward to understand the above behaviors through the diagrams in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman1 ] and [ fig : feynman2 ] . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman1 ]  ( a ) , all internal propagators have typically large off - shellness : @xmath51 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman2 ]  ( a ) , the virtuality of the second photon , equal to the mass square of the vector meson , is much smaller . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to accommodate with the constituent scaling rule , one can technically count the valence degrees of freedom of the neutral vector meson as @xmath21 since it is produced by a photon , which amounts to count the number of lines attached to the effective vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the lesson one can learn from the above example is : not all ingredients undergo the hard momentum transfer at the scale @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the fall - off is determined by the leading - power operator at the scale @xmath52 which has a nonzero matrix element with the hadron . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the original constituent counting rule is applicable at finite scattering angles . </S>",
    "<S> if the scattering angle is small , at least two of the involved particles are collinear which will also spoil the constituent counting rule .    </S>",
    "<S> let us switch to the exclusive production of multiquark states , and take the reaction @xmath53 as an example . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it has been argued that its cross section in the @xmath54 limit obeys the scaling @xmath55 where the @xmath56 is a tetraquark state composed of two quarks and two antiquarks . </S>",
    "<S> we have put a question mark to the above scaling behavior since we believe that it is problematic at very high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we show a production mechanism in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynman2 ]  ( a ) . in this diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quark pair @xmath57 is generated from the qcd vacuum , and thus such a contribution is suppressed by @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> but since the main focus of this work is the scaling behavior in terms of the collision energy , we are less interested in the @xmath59 suppression . integrating out the off - shell intermediate propagators at the scale @xmath0 we find that the @xmath60 behaves as an ordinary @xmath61 meson and the @xmath12 dependence scaling of the cross - section is determined by the light quarks of the @xmath60 : @xmath62 which can again be obtained by counting the number of lines attached to the effective vertex </S>",
    "<S> apparently , this production mechanism will become dominant at very high energies with @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> a further example is the reaction @xmath64 argued to exhibit the fall - off scaling  @xcite , @xmath65 which should be corrected as @xmath66 the above results are applicable for the longitudinal polarization , while the transverse polarized case should be further suppressed by @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy to mention that the above discussions on the @xmath67 production are valid in both the tetraquark ( diquark - anti - diquark or a democratically arranged four - quark state ) , and hadronic molecular pictures . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior is the same in both scenarios , and therefore one can hardly make a statement distinguishing a compact tetraquark from a meson - meson molecule using hard exclusive processes .     for the reaction @xmath68 at very high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57 quark pair is generated by qcd interactions at the scale @xmath69 which is much lower than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    -0 cm    ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has applied the naive counting rule to the photoproduction of hyperon resonances and attempted to study the @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath70 is expected to be a @xmath71-@xmath72 bound state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted constituent number is energy - dependent , which can be understood since the constituent counting rule determines the asymptotic behavior in the large energy limit , and will be distorted by finite energy corrections . at the largest collision energy , </S>",
    "<S> however the obtained constituent number is consistent with three for the @xmath70 , despite of the large errors . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath73 does not imply that the @xmath70 is an ordinary @xmath74 baryon but instead it shows that the production mechanism of the @xmath70 at short distances involves three quarks .    regarding the notable exotics candidate @xmath2 , an important task in understanding its nature involves the discrimination of a quark - antiquark configuration , a compact multiquark configuration and a hadronic molecule ( we refer to the recent review  @xcite which summarizes nicely the literature ) . unlike the @xmath67 , the @xmath2 is neutral , and both the light quark  </S>",
    "<S> antiquark pair and charm  </S>",
    "<S> anticharm quark pair are hidden . </S>",
    "<S> so in hard exclusive processes , the @xmath2 can be produced at short distances by two sets of operators : @xmath75 with @xmath76 being a light @xmath77 quark field , and @xmath78 denoting the lorentz structure of the operator to produce the @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit form of the contributing operators depends on the process . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has explored the inclusive production of @xmath2 in @xmath80 decays and at hadron colliders , and pointed out that the most important term in the factorization formula should be the color - octet @xmath81 term . in exclusive </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 decays into @xmath2 , the @xmath83 contributes  @xcite , and ratios of branching fractions can be predicted with a high precision under this mechanism , no matter whether the long - distance nature of @xmath79 is given by a tetraquark or hadronic molecule composition .    to understand the internal structure of exotic hadron candidates , it is essential to figure out the corresponding valence quark - gluon compositions . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low energies , since the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons , and only integrated quantities can be observed , it is very hard to determine the valence components . </S>",
    "<S> one might hope that cross sections of the exclusive productions of these hadrons may be used to determine the valence components of a multiquark state since there are constituent counting rules for hard exclusive processes determined by the number of elementary particles involved . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have argued in this paper that multiquark states with hidden flavors do not have to follow the scaling rule by simply counting the number of valence quarks and antiquarks . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the hidden - flavor pair could be produced by a much softer momentum exchange . in the spirit of effective field theory , </S>",
    "<S> the correct counting rule can be obtained by integrating out the hard scale , modulo possible additional factors due to helicity suppression and so on . </S>",
    "<S> the counting rule is demonstrated using the @xmath28 process . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed productions of the @xmath84 , @xmath2 and others in a few hard exclusive processes . </S>"
