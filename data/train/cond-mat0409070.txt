    "<S> we study the effect of lower dimensional geometry on the frequencies of the collective oscillations of a bose - einstein condensate confined in a trap . to study the effect of two dimensional geometry we consider a pancake - shaped condensate confined in a harmonic trap and employ various models for the coupling constant depending on the thickness of the condensate relative to the the value of the scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> these models correspond to different scattering regimes ranging from quasi - three dimensional to strictly two dimensional regimes . using these models for the coupling parameter and </S>",
    "<S> sum rule approach of the many - body response theory we derive analytical expressions for the frequencies of the monopole and the quadrupole modes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the frequencies of monopole mode of the collective oscillations are significantly altered by the reduced dimensionality and also study the evolution of the frequencies as the system make transition from one regime to another .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , several theoretical and experimental studies devoted to the influence of dimensionality on the properties of a bose - einstein condensate in a harmonic trap have been reported in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of dimensionality affects the physical properties of the condensates resulting in very different features from their three dimensional ( 3d ) counterparts . in current experiments on bose - einstein condensates with alkali atoms confined in a magnetic trap the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 ( defined as the ratio between the frequencies of the trap in the z- and the transverse directions ) may be varied to achieve condensates with special properties which are characteristic of the low dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by making the anisotropy parameter much larger than unity ( @xmath1 ) a flatter and flatter ( pancake - shaped ) condensate can be produced . </S>",
    "<S> such a pancake - shaped condensate is expected to exhibit special features of two dimensional ( 2d ) condensate . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that in the 2d case the scattering properties are very different as compared to the 3d case and this in turn lead to a significant modification of the boson - boson coupling constant . for example , the boson - boson coupling constant in 2d limit becomes density dependent even at a low density and zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this for 3d case , to the lowest order in the density the interactions are described by constant coupling strength and deviations occur only when quantum depletion and finite temperature effects are taken into considerations @xcite .    in a pancake shaped 3d condensate as the anisotropy parameter </S>",
    "<S> is increased the physical properties of the condensate first change due to the modified shape of the confinement @xcite and then also due to the alteration of the scattering properties . with respect to the scattering properties of a flat pancake - shaped condensate </S>",
    "<S> three regimes can be identified which are characterized by different expressions for the coupling constant @xcite . when the linear dimension of the condensate along z - axis given by @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the z - component of the angular frequency of the trapping potential and @xmath4 is the mass of the trapped atoms ) is still much larger than the 3d scattering length @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , the collisions still take place in three dimensions and this is referred to as quasi-3d ( q3d ) regime . on further increasing the anisotropy parameter </S>",
    "<S> the condensate gets more tightly confined along the z - axis but the assumption that the scattering is unaffected begins to break down when @xmath7 and the condensate is said to be in quasi-2d ( q2d ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> a fully 2d condensate is achieved when @xmath8 so that the collisions are restricted only in the transverse @xmath9 plane . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to expect that as the condensate evolves from a fully 3d to a fully 2d regime its static and dynamic properties undergo dramatic changes . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the evolution of the density profile of a condensate has been investigated as the system crosses from the 3d to the 2d regime . </S>",
    "<S> they have found that the widths of the density distribution crucially depend on the collisional properties or the boson - boson interaction parameters in the different regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> the main aim of this letter is to study the effect of lower dimensionality on the the frequencies of the collective oscillations of a condensate . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we calculate the collective oscillation frequencies of the quadrupole and monopole modes of a flat pancake - shaped condensate and study how these frequencies evolve as the system undergo transitions from the q3d to the q2d and to a strictly 2d regime . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we make use of the sum rule approach of many - body response theory @xcite . by employing this method </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytical expressions for the frequencies of the quadrupole and the monopole modes . in the following we first derive these expressions and then discuss the results .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a dilute condensate with @xmath10 bosons confined in an anisotropic ( pancake shaped ) harmonic trap characterized by the frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 with the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 being much larger than unity . within the density functional theory , </S>",
    "<S> the ground properties of a condensate can be completely described by the ground state condensate density @xmath13 in @xmath9 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state density of the condensate can be determined by minimizing the local density energy functional @xmath14 = \\int d^{2}{\\bf r}\\left [ -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}|{\\bf\\nabla}\\sqrt{\\rho({\\bf r})}|^{2 } + v_{ext}({\\bf r})\\rho ( { \\bf r } ) + \\epsilon ( \\rho ) \\rho ( { \\bf r})\\right ] , \\label{energyfunc}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the external harmonic potential in the transverse direction given by @xmath16 in the above equation ( [ energyfunc ] ) the first and the third terms represent the kinetic energy and the energy due to the interatomic interaction within local density approximation ( lda ) respectively . within this approximation </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy per particle @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coupling constant whose form depends on the collisional properties of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath19 is independent of the density for the 3d case , on the other hand in the purely 2d regime it depends logarithimically on the density . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we briefly describe the models for the coupling constant @xmath19 valid in the different collisional regimes .    for the 3d system the coupling parameter @xmath19 which is a constant completely determined by the s - wave scattering length @xmath5 and it is given by @xmath20 when the linear dimension @xmath21 of the condensate along the z - direction is much larger the 3d scattering length @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the collisions still take place in three dimensions . under this condition the effective coupling constant @xmath22 which includes the effects of reduced dimensionality only is given by @xcite @xmath23 on further increasing the anisotropy and and @xmath21 becoming comparable to @xmath5 ( @xmath24 ) , the collisions start getting affected by the tight confinement along the z - direction . </S>",
    "<S> under such a condition the condensate is said to be in q2d regime . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant in this regime is given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the ground state density of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the above expression was originally derived by petrov et al </S>",
    "<S> . @xcite by studying the scattering properties of a bosonic system which is trapped harmonically trapped in the z - direction and uniform in the @xmath9 plane . </S>",
    "<S> a similar expression was later derived by lee et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also by employing many - body t - matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note here that in the q2d regime the coupling constant becomes dependent on the density in accordance with the behaviour of collisions in two dimensions . finally , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath21 becomes much smaller than @xmath5 ( @xmath27 ) , the collisions can be safely assumed to be taking place in two dimensions resulting in a 2d condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant in 2d regime is given by @xmath28 notice that the expression for @xmath29 also depends on the density @xmath26 but the information about the confinement direction is absent as it corresponds to the purely 2d case . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for @xmath29 was derived in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a homogenous bose gas of hard disc . </S>",
    "<S> this form of @xmath29 has been employed to study the properties cofined bosons in two dimensions @xcite and the rigorous justification for this use was provided by lieb et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> having described the different models for the coupling constant , we now briefly discuss the method for obtaining the frequencies of the monopole and the quadrupole modes of collective oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned earlier for this purpose we employ the sum - rule approach of the many - body response theory . </S>",
    "<S> the most important advantage of this method is that the calculation of frequencies requires the knowledge of the ground - state wave function ( or the corresponding ground - state density ) of many body system only . in accordance to the basic results of the sum - rule approach @xcite the upper bound of the lowest excitation energy </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32-th order moment of the excitation energy @xmath33 associated with the excitation operator @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the frequency excitation . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 is the excitation energy of eigenstate @xmath37 of the hamiltonian @xmath38 of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ubfreq ] ) is close to the exact lowest excited state when this state is highly collective , that is , when the oscillator strength is almost exhausted by a single mode . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is satisfied by the trapped bosons in most of the cases . moreover , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ubfreq ] ) can be used for computation of the excitation energies by exploiting the fact that the moments @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be expressed as expectation values of the commutators between @xmath34 and @xmath38 in the ground state @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42\\right ] |0\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ m_{3 } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\langle 0|\\left [ \\left [ f^{\\dagger},h\\right ] , \\left [ \\left [ h,[h , f\\right ] \\right ] \\right ]    \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the purpose of calculation of @xmath39 and @xmath40 as given by the above equation we need to first choose an appropriate excitation opertaor @xmath34 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ freqq ] ) and ( [ freqm ] ) for the q3d case match with the corresponding results of ref </S>",
    "<S> . @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ freqq ] ) that the frequency of the qudrupole mode is not explicitly dependent on the interaction energy and it is true in all the three regimes considered in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to note here that the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ freqq ] ) is identical to the expression for the frequency of the quadrupole mode of a 3d condensate with constant coupling parameter @xcite . in the absence of inter particle interactions we have @xmath61 and </S>",
    "<S> this leads to harmonic oscillator result @xmath62 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when interaction energy is much larger than the kinetic energy so that the kinetic energy can be neglected ( thomas - fermi approximation ) we get @xmath63 . in the general case one needs to know the value of kinetic energy of the ground state for accurate estimation of the frequency of quadrupole mode .    </S>",
    "<S> now we focus our attention on the frequency of the monopole mode of the collective oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the quadrupole case the frequencies of monopole mode are explicitly dependent on the interaction energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the frequencies of the monopole mode will be affected by different models of the coupling constant . to illustrate the dependence of the interaction energy on the frequencies more clearly we substitute the virial relations associated with the three models @xmath64 in the respective expressions in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ freqm ] ) to obtain @xmath65 the first of the above equation shows that unlike the q2d and the 2d cases the frequency of the monopole mode in the q3d regime is independent of the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the monopole mode in the q3d regime is given by the frequency of a 2d harmonic ocsillator . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to point out that in contrast to the q3d case the frequency of the monopole mode of a 3d condensate is explicitly dependent on the interaction strength @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the detail study of the frequencies of the monopole mode for the q2d and the 2d models of the coupling constant . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we first need to evaluate the integrals given in the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqi ] ) . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we employ the ground state densities @xmath66 of the condensates which are obtained within the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation . furthermore , to obtain the densities within the tf approximation the spatial dependence of the coupling constants is also neglected by using results of the homogenous system to relate the density to the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in the refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that for large @xmath10 the tf approximation and spatially independent form of the coupling constant yield sufficiently accurate results .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin the discussion of the results with the values of relevant parameters from the experiments of gorlitz et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with @xmath67 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that this value of n is consistent with the tf approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters indicate that the condensate produced in the experiment falls within the q3d regime . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers obtained by us for the monopole frequencies of this system are @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> these results clearly show that for the above system the q2d result is very close to the corresponding q3d number . however , the 2d model overestimates the frequency of the monopole mode and this is anticipated as this model is not applicable to the condensate achieved in the above - mentioned experiment .    now to study the effect of different models of the coupling constant and their applicability </S>",
    "<S> we choose three different values of the parameter @xmath73 : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are chosen such a way that the first , the second and the third numbers fall in the q3d , the q2d and the 2d regimes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this we also choose @xmath77 so that the condensate has negligible length in the z - direction and the motion along this axis is completely frozen . </S>",
    "<S> the results with these parameters are presented in table i. again we can see from table i that for @xmath78 the numbers predicted by the q3d and the q2d models are very close and the corresponding result from the 2d model is quite higher than these two numbers . for @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> the numbers obtained by the both q2d and 2d models are markedly different from the result of q3d model . as has been discussed before for @xmath80 along with the large value of @xmath0 the scattering properties start to get influenced by the confinement . in this situation </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the q2d and 2d models will give significantly different numbers in comparison to the corresponding q3d result . in the light of our earlier discussion </S>",
    "<S> we expect that for @xmath80 the coupling constant is better described by the q2d model . on the other hand , for this value of @xmath73 the frequency of the monopole mode obtained with the 2d model </S>",
    "<S> is higher than that of q2d model . as the the interaction parameter @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> is further increased to a value @xmath81 the scattering properties become truly two dimensional , consequently for this value of @xmath73 the 2d model should be able to predict the frequency of the monopole mode of a two dimensional condensate . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of @xmath80 , for @xmath82 the value of the frequency obtained by the 2d model is lower than the corresponding number from the q2d model .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , for the sake of completeness we plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 the frequencies of the monopole mode obtained with three different models as a function of the interaction parameter @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are drawn with the anisotropy parameter @xmath83 and the number of atoms @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be clearly seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that the frequencies of the monopole mode obtained with the three models of the coupling constant exhibit different trend with the increase in the interaction parameter @xmath73 . for example </S>",
    "<S> , in contrast to the constant value of the frequency for the q3d case the frequencies obtained by employing the q2d and the 2d models increase as @xmath73 is increased . as mentioned </S>",
    "<S> before it is only for @xmath85 the values of frequencies obtained by the q3d and the q2d models are very close and the 2d model gives quite different numbers . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , when @xmath73 exceeds the value @xmath86 , the effects of reduced dimensionality start affecting the scattering properties and both q2d and 2d models give different results as compared to the q3d numbers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude from our results that the collective frequencies of the monopole mode and their behaviour can be used to identify the dimensionality of the systems as the system evolves from q3d to a strictly 2d regime . the results of theoretical calculations can also be used to test the validity of different models of the coupling constant by comparing them with the experimental values .    in summary , we have calculated the frequencies of collective oscillations of the bose - einstein condensate confined in a flat pancake - shaped trap . the condensate is tightly trapped along z - axis such that the motion along this axis is frozen . </S>",
    "<S> for such a condensate depending on the value of the ratio between the size of the condensate along the z - direction and the s - wave scattering length , three different regimes can be identified identified . </S>",
    "<S> these three different regimes are described by three different models for the boson - boson interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the frequencies of the of collective oscillations corresponding to these three models . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we have used sum - rule approach of many body response theory along with the ground - state density obtained within the tf approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper is that the different models for the coupling constant are clearly manifested in the frequency of the monopole mode and they lead to distinct results in the region of their applicability . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of modification of the collision properties in two dimension start changing the monopole frequency when the value of @xmath73 becomes more than @xmath86 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> quadrupole mode is not explicitly dependent on the coupling parameter and thus not affected by the boson - boson interactions . </S>"
