    "in this work we describe a new determination of the primordial @xmath5he abundance ( @xmath0 ) , based on the abundance analysis of five metal - poor extragalactic h  ii regions .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is still one of the missing pieces in the cosmological scenario . according to the standard model of big - bang nucleosynthesis , the primordial abundance of four light isotopes ( d , @xmath6li , @xmath7he , and @xmath5he ) depends on one parameter only , the baryon - to - photon ratio .",
    "therefore , the four abundance values provide altogether a strong constraint on the cosmological models .",
    "unfortunately , their determination is not an easy task , and each of the four isotopes poses a different challenge . in particular , although @xmath5he is the most abundant of the four and the easiest to measure , it is also the less sensitive to the baryon - to - photon fraction : this feature implies that @xmath0 determinations must be both accurate to be truthful , and precise to be meaningful .",
    "current @xmath0 determinations are thought to be accurate to the third decimal digit , a level at which differences still matter from the point of view of cosmology . to improve further",
    ", one must take into account all the sources of uncertainty that affect , down to this level , both the accuracy and the precision of @xmath0 determinations . in the following , we will briefly discuss some of these sources ; see also the reviews by @xcite and @xcite for a more complete discussion of this topic and a quantitative estimate of the error budget in the determination of @xmath0 .    according to the standard scenario ,",
    "the universe was born with zero metallicity ( @xmath8 ) ; hence , @xmath0 can be determined extrapolating to @xmath9 the relationship between @xmath8 and the @xmath5he abundance ( @xmath1 ) for a sample of objects .",
    "this procedure relies on the determination of the individual @xmath1 and @xmath8 values , and of the slope @xmath10 of the @xmath1 vs. @xmath8 curve , which is assumed linear .",
    "the uncertainty affecting @xmath0 depends directly on the uncertainties affecting either of these basic ingredients , i.e. @xmath10 and the ensemble of the ( @xmath1 , @xmath8 ) pairs .",
    "for this reason , it has long been thought that the best results are obtained from the analysis of extremely low - metallicity objects , such as dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) and blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) , since the use of these objects minimizes the uncertainty associated to @xmath10 .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have noted that this advantage is outweighed by the relatively higher uncertainty on the @xmath1 values , which derives from the ( unknown ) collisional contribution to the balmer line intensities : an uncertainty especially affecting these objects since collisional contribution is quite important at high temperatures , and rapidly fades away at intermediate and low temperatures .",
    "as we will see throughout the paper , a precise estimate of this contribution is rather difficult to obtain , and the resulting uncertainty more than offsets the smaller uncertainty in the extrapolation to @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite suggests to use moderately low - metallicity regions in the determination of @xmath0 , because in those regions the collisional contribution can be neglected , and the effect of the uncertainty on the slope is still moderate .",
    "this paper is concerned mainly with the estimation of the collisional contribution to the balmer lines in low - metallicity regions , and of both the correction and the additional uncertainty it introduces in the value of @xmath0 . in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper  i ) we discussed the effect of temperature structure on the determination of @xmath0 , and derived a new value of @xmath0 based on a sample of five extragalactic h  ii regions with low and very low metallicities : ngc  346 , ngc  2363 , h  29 , sbs  0335052 , and i  zw  18 ; paper  i also contains a preliminary discussion of the effect of collisions on the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the abundance analysis of these objects is based on the combined use of standard empirical relations and tailored photoionization models . in the case of ngc 2363",
    ", we used the models described in @xcite , while ngc 346 has been modeled by @xcite .",
    "the models for the remaining three objects will be described in the present paper .",
    "the models presented in this paper are based on improved calculations with respect to those mentioned in paper i. the main changes introduced are the following : ( i ) the photoionization code cloudy 94 @xcite was used instead of the older version cloudy 90 ( an exhaustive list of the differences between the two versions can be found at http://www.pa.uky.edu/@xmath11gary/cloudy ) ; ( ii ) the geometry of the models was modified to improve the fit with the observed quantities ; ( iii ) the ionizing sources were computed with the population synthesis code described in @xcite , instead of starburst99 @xcite .",
    "the synthesis code by @xcite allows taking into account the sampling effects in the initial mass function ( imf ) , which is filled stochastically following a monte carlo method . while in very massive stellar populations the imf",
    "can be effectively described by an analytical law , in smaller populations sampling effects can be important , and an analytical description of the imf artificially introduces fractional numbers of stars in the high - mass end of the mass spectrum , where the statistics is intrinsically low . as a result ,",
    "those parts of the spectrum depending strongly on the massive star population may be unrealistically represented by an analytical description .",
    "the sense of using monte carlo simulations is therefore the search for self - consistency , rather than the goal of reproducing the specific stellar content of these clusters .",
    "stated otherwise , we do nt aim at reproducing the observed cluster as it is , since specific information on the stellar content of the regions analyzed is not available ; we rather attempt to build a synthesis model that is both physically self - consistent , and capable of reproducing the observational constraints .",
    "this conditions are sufficient to build meaningful photoionization models .",
    "all the models described in this work assume a salpeter imf in the mass range 2  120 m@xmath12 , and evolutionary tracks with stellar metallicity @xmath13 and the standard mass - loss rates by @xcite ; the stellar metallicity is the lowest available value among the stellar libraries included in the synthesis code .",
    "as for the stellar atmospheres , the code uses the models by @xcite at @xmath14 for main sequence ( ms ) hot stars , those by @xcite for wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , and those by @xcite at @xmath8 = 0.002 for the remaining stars . as a safety check , we have compared the resulting effective rates of ionizing photons @xcite for h@xmath15 , he@xmath15 , he@xmath16 , o@xmath15 , o@xmath16 , and o@xmath17 to those obtained with the new version of starburst99 with the atmosphere models by @xcite and evolutionary tracks with high mass - loss rates @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective rates of ionizing photons in the two codes for h@xmath15 , he@xmath15 , o@xmath15 , and o@xmath16 coincide to better than 0.15 dex for the age range considered in this work , despite the differences in the evolutionary tracks and the atmosphere models . on the other hand , there are strong differences , amounting to more than 0.9 dex , for the effective ionizing rates of he@xmath16 and o@xmath17 , which determine the abundances of he@xmath17 and o@xmath18 respectively .",
    "hence , our results are virtually independent on the model atmospheres and evolutionary tracks assumed , except for the case of he@xmath17 ( which will be not be used as a constraint : see section  [ sec : obs_constraints ] below ) , and the case of o@xmath18 , which is an unimportant ion .",
    "the spectra used in the modeling were computed using the following procedure : ( i ) from the emission rate of ionizing photons @xmath19 inferred from the observations , and through a comparison with the results of a completely sampled imf , we have obtained a first estimate of the mass transformed into stars and of the number of stars for the given imf and mass limits ; ( ii ) from the observed features of the spectrum , we have constrained the age range of each object ; for example , the presence of wr features implies that the age of the starburst is in the range 2.9  3.1 myr for the case of an instantaneous burst ( ib ) , or larger than 2.9 myr for the case of a continuous star formation ( csf ) burst ; ( iii ) with the input parameters obtained in the previous steps , we have performed a large number of monte carlo simulations ; ( iv ) among all the simulations , we have selected those with a @xmath19 value consistent with the observations ; ( v ) for those h  ii regions whose spectra show wr features we have further selected the simulations including wr stars ; ( vi ) finally , we have chosen the simulations with the largest value of the ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the emission rate of photons with energy @xmath22 ryd ; this choice is motivated by the general tendency in most of our trial models of emitting globally too low oxygen lines : this criterion is a simple way of overcoming this difficulty , since a harder spectra increases the @xmath23 parameter @xcite .",
    "the particular features of each object will be discussed in the corresponding section .",
    "this section describes the geometric assumptions made in our models .",
    "one of the most important features of h  ii regions affecting the geometric assumptions made in the modeling is photon leak : for example , @xcite estimate that 25 to 60 percent of the ionizing photons escape from giant h  ii regions . in a spherically symmetric model , the escape of photons can be modeled in two basic ways , which correspond to two different geometrical scenarios .",
    "the first assumes that the actual radius is smaller than the strmgren radius ( @xmath24 ) , or , equivalently , that the gas cloud ends before it succeeds in absorbing all the ionizing photons .",
    "a model with this feature is _ density bounded _ ( the radius is determined by the quantity of gas available ) , whereas a model reaching the strmgren radius is _ radiation bounded _ ( the radius is determined by the rate of ionizing photons emitted by the central source ) .",
    "a density bounded model can be roughly thought of as a radiation bounded model from which the outer zones have been stripped away : since these zones are those where the low ionization ions are found , a density bounded model has lower absolute intensities and a higher average ionization degree than the corresponding radiation bounded model . the second possibility to model photon",
    "escape in a simple way is to assume that the cloud does not cover the whole solid angle around the ionizing source , but rather an angle @xmath25 , a situation expressed by stating that a _ covering factor _ is assumed ; the covering factor is the fraction @xmath26 .",
    "the physical picture is that all the ionizing photons emitted along certain directions are completely trapped , whereas all those emitted in other directions freely escape ; or , equivalently , that the model is radiation bounded along certain directions , and ` extremely ' density bounded ( in the sense that no gas at all is encountered ) along the others .",
    "the model is still spherically symmetric because the two kinds of directions are assumed to be completely mixed .",
    "a model with @xmath27 has lower absolute intensities and the same ionization degree as the corresponding model with @xmath28 , because low and high ionization degree zones are cut away proportionally .",
    "real nebulae are probably intermediate between the two scenarios described : the gas ends up at different radii according to the direction considered , possibly covering all the range between 0 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that the simple relations between the properties of radiation and density bounded models , and between the properties of models with @xmath28 and @xmath27 , hold only if all the other input parameters are left unchanged . in the actual modeling practice things",
    "are not so straightforward , since we might want to change simultaneously several input parameters depending on which constraints we adopt .",
    "for instance , if we want to reproduce a given total @xmath29 value to fit an observed h  ii region , and to this aim we compute a sequence of models with varying @xmath30 , the observational constraint on @xmath31 forces us to increase the ionizing flux proportionally to the decrease in @xmath30 , and this change simultaneously yields changes in the local ionization degree .      for each model , we computed the intensities of the most important emission lines ( h@xmath32 , h@xmath33 , [ o  iii ] @xmath34 , [ o  ii ] @xmath35 , [ o  i ] @xmath36 , [ s  ii ] @xmath37 , and he  ii @xmath38 ) ; the average temperatures @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( hereinafter @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , as in paper i ) , with @xmath45 defined , for a given ion x , by the expression : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the electron temperature , @xmath48 the electron density , @xmath49 the ionic density , and @xmath50 the observed volume ; the ` empirical ' [ o  iii ] temperature @xmath51 ( hereinafter @xmath52 ) obtained from the standard relation applied to the predicted @xmath53 ratio ; the ` empirical ' [ o  ii ] temperature @xmath54 ( hereinafter @xmath55 ) , obtained from the expression @xmath56 \\label{eq : toii}\\ ] ] @xcite ; the temperature fluctuation parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ( hereinafter @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as in paper i ) , with @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 ^ 2 n_{\\rm e } n({\\rm x } ) dv}{t_0({\\rm x})^2\\int_v n_{\\rm e } n({\\rm x } ) dv};\\ ] ] the ionization fraction @xmath65 , defined as @xmath66 dv},\\ ] ] called @xmath32 in paper i ; the related quantity @xmath67 ; and the helium ionization correction factor , @xmath68 , defined by the relation :    @xmath69    the emission spectrum and the other computed quantities of each model were modified to simulate the bias introduced by the angular extension of the slits used in the observations .",
    "this step is crucial in the modeling , since the observed emission spectrum depends strongly on the portion of the nebula included in the aperture , as a consequence of the ionization and temperature structure of the nebula : see a thorough discussion and multiple examples of this effect in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the output quantities fall in three distinct categories : the first group includes those quantities that are computed to be compared with the corresponding observational constraints , and their agreement determine whether the fitting procedure is converging or not ; this is the case of the line intensities , and of @xmath55 and @xmath52 , which are the theoretical quantities that correspond to the observed temperatures derived from the line ratios [ o  ii ] @xmath70 and [ o  iii ] @xmath53 . to this respect ,",
    "note that the intensities of the helium lines have not been included in the set of observational constraints because they are not useful for this scope : as all the recombination lines arising from a dominant ion , they are very weakly dependent on the features of the model .",
    "the second group includes those output quantities computed with the aim of obtaining an information that is not available from observations : this is the case of @xmath71(he ) , whose predicted value is assumed to be equal to the actual one , and is used to compute the total helium abundance .",
    "finally , the remaining quantities are computed either for information , or because they are necessary to compute other predicted quantities : for example , @xmath43 and @xmath61 are used to compute the predicted @xmath55 by means of equation  ( [ eq : toii ] ) .",
    "the average temperatures @xmath72 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 and the temperature fluctuations parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 give a measure of the temperature structure of the models , and describe how it compares with the temperature structure of the actual region . as a rule , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 always turn out to be smaller than the corresponding empirical quantities .",
    "analogously , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are always smaller than @xmath55 and @xmath52 respectively , unless @xmath73 or @xmath74 ; see @xcite and paper  i for more details .",
    "the basic conceptual step in the fitting procedure is the comparison between the observed line intensities to the value predicted by our models . in this comparison ,",
    "the largest weight is given to h@xmath33 , [ o  iii ]  @xmath75 , and [ o  ii ] @xmath76 , for the following two reasons : first , these lines are among the brightest of the spectrum , so they carry the smallest errors ; second , they define the energetics and the ionization structure of the region , giving a first - order description of its overall structure . on the other hand , [ o  iii",
    "] @xmath77 is not a robust constraint , because it may be affected by heating processes other than photoionization ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the intensity of [ o  i ] @xmath36 depends strongly on the detailed description of the outer parts of the nebula , and is enhanced by the occurrence of filaments and clumps ; finally , the detailed modeling of he  ii @xmath38 is not possible yet .",
    "this line forms in the recombination of he@xmath17 , an ion that can be produced potentially by different sources of radiation , and each candidate source poses a different problem that makes difficult to estimate quantitatively its relation to the nebular @xmath38 line .",
    "the most plausible sources of he@xmath17 are the hard radiation field of wr stars and the x - ray emission produced in the burst .",
    "wr stars , which are revealed by broad emission features in the spectrum , are not univocally associated to to nebular @xmath38 emission , since in some cases they are observed with no associated nebular @xmath38 line , and in other cases the nebular @xmath38 is observed without detected wr stars ; furthermore , the wr formation mechanism at low metallicities is still poorly understood , and standard evolutionary models systematically underpredict their number ( see , e.g. , the case of i  zw  18 : * ? ? ?",
    ". the second candidate , x - ray emission , can be in turn ascribed to different sources : massive binary systems , supernova ( sn ) remnants , and the reprocessing of the gas kinetic energy in the interstellar medium . as for the first of these sources ,",
    "the expected number of massive x - ray binaries is roughly 4 percent of the number of newly formed o stars @xcite ; a similar fraction is also obtained by means of theoretical estimations ( m. cervio , m. mas - hesse , & d. kunth , in preparation ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of massive x - ray binaries also implies the existence of sn remnants , which are a further source of he@xmath17 ; for both these sources to be present , the age of the burst must be larger than 3 myr .",
    "finally , the conversion of kinetic energy in x rays can be modeled assuming an efficiency factor , which can be estimated from the size of the bubbles in the region and from quantitative x - ray observations .",
    "unfortunately , these data are not available for the h  ii regions considered in this work , with the only exception of i  zw  18 , where x rays have been detected @xcite .",
    "this brief discussion illustrates the difficulty of using the nebular @xmath38 intensity to constrain the properties of the cluster .",
    "this difficulty is increased by the statistical dispersion in both the number of wr stars and of x - ray sources @xcite : this implies that , even if the quantitative relation between a particular source and the intensity of @xmath38 were perfectly known , there would still be a residual uncertainty in the modeling of those regions where sampling effects are relevant .",
    "the effects of the collisional enhancement of balmer lines on the determination of @xmath0 have already been discussed by several authors : see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ". this section will give a general overview of the problem , and describe the particular strategy followed in this work to give a quantitative estimate of the effect .      in h  ii regions ,",
    "the main process contributing to the intensity of balmer lines is h@xmath16 recombination .",
    "under appropriate physical conditions , a further contribution can arise from the cascade following the collisional excitation of h@xmath15 from the ground state to an excited level .",
    "this contribution is generally a minor one , both because the fraction of h@xmath15 inside the h  ii region is very small , and because very few free electrons have energies sufficient to make ground - state h@xmath15 electrons jump to excited levels in the typical conditions of h  ii regions ( a minimum of 12 ev is required to produce h@xmath32 , more than that for the higher balmer lines ) .",
    "nevertheless , collisional enhancement of balmer lines might reach a relative value of several percent . if not taken into account , the collisional contribution has two biasing effects on the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the first is a straightforward consequence of the enhancement of the observed balmer intensities : if the observed intensity is interpreted in terms of pure h@xmath16 recombination , the he@xmath16/h@xmath16 abundance is underestimated .",
    "the second effect is a consequence of the different collisional enhancements suffered by h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 : since the relative collisional increase in h@xmath32 is always larger than that in h@xmath33 , the measured h@xmath32/h@xmath33 ratio is larger than it would be without collisions , producing a spurious reddening in the balmer spectrum that mimics a higher extinction @xcite .",
    "this extra - reddening , when not properly subtracted out from the observed reddening to get the true extinction , has different consequences on the abundance determination according to the wavelength considered : it enhances the ratio @xmath78 for lines blueward of h@xmath33 , and decreases it for lines redward of h@xmath33 .",
    "since he@xmath16/h@xmath16 is generally obtained as the weighted mean of the helium abundances obtained by different line ratios , the net result of neglecting the effects of collisional enhancement depends on which helium lines are used ; in practice , it always traduces in a spurious @xmath1 decrease since the helium lines redward of h@xmath33 are globally brighter than those blueward of h@xmath33 ( particularly he  i @xmath79 ) , and therefore are those that weigh the most in the analysis",
    ". an accurate determination of @xmath1 relies therefore on an accurate determination of the collisional effects affecting the line intensities of the region considered .",
    "this is in general a very difficult task , as we will make clear in the following .",
    "the ratio between the collisional and the recombination contribution to the emissivity of a balmer line , e.g. h@xmath32 , is related to the local conditions in the gas through the following expression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the excitation energy of the upper @xmath82 level ( @xmath83 ) from the ground level ( @xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 is the recombination coefficient . in this expression",
    ", we omitted those terms that are either constant or slowly varying with @xmath47 .",
    "we also omitted the contribution to @xmath86 from electrons excited to levels @xmath87 that cascade down to @xmath83 and finally produce an h@xmath32 photon . although simplified , this expression serves the scope of illustrating the difficulty of obtaining an accurate determination of collisional enhancement .",
    "first , the ratio @xmath88 is directly proportional to @xmath89 , which is poorly known because it can not be directly measured . the only possibility to estimate it is through a photoionization model ; a very good model is needed to this scope , and it is important to assess to which extent the results obtained are model - dependent .",
    "second , the ratio @xmath88 depends strongly on the temperature , particularly through the boltzmann factor @xmath90 .",
    "this dependence poses a difficult problem , since most photoionization models underestimate the temperature observed in h  ii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see also @xcite for a different result ) .",
    "this fact suggests that an extra - heating energy source is operating in h  ii regions .",
    "several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nature of such energy source , but none of them has yet found general agreement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most important , even the knowledge of the nature of the the extra - heating source would not probably imply a knowledge of the exact temperature structure , and particularly its spatial correlation to the ionization structure , which enters equation  ( [ eq : ctor ] ) through the product of @xmath89 with the boltzmann factor .",
    "finally , an important issue is the accuracy of the atomic parameters involved in the calculations . for the collisional transitions from the hydrogen ground level up to @xmath91 , cloudy 94 uses the recent calculations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although these authors do not give any explicit number regarding the estimated accuracy of their calculations , they perform a comparison with previous results , finding differences smaller than 15 percent in the energy range of interest . whether this number can be taken as a good measure of the current uncertainties ,",
    "it is difficult to say ; our impression is that the overall uncertainty introduced by atomic physics plays a minor role in this study .",
    "an upper limit to the collisional enhancement of balmer lines is always implicitly defined by the observed reddening .",
    "this limit corresponds to the extreme case in which the internal extinction of the observed object , @xmath92 , is negligible ( with `` internal extinction '' meaning extinction caused by dust physically associated to the h  ii region , independently of it being mixed with the ionized gas or not ) , and is therefore equal to the collisional enhancement that would produce exactly the observed reddening , corrected for the galactic intrinsic extinction @xmath93 : that is , if we define a collisional reddening coefficient as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the total and the recombination intensities , and @xmath97 is the value of the reddening function at @xmath82 , then the observed reddening coefficient can be written as : @xmath98 thus @xmath99 in the following , by the expression `` collisional reddening '' we will always implicitly refer to the collisional reddening _ of the balmer lines _ , and not to a global reddening affecting the whole spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that the same line of reasoning exposed above could be applied to higher balmer lines , with the aim of obtaining further constraints on collisional excitation .",
    "the amount of estimated collisions has a weaker direct influence on the derived h@xmath100 and h@xmath101 intensities than in the case of h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 , since these lines have higher excitation thresholds . on the other hand ,",
    "the degree in which collisions occur determines how much of the observed reddening is due to interstellar extinction , which in turn has an important impact on these lines : therefore , they can be in principle strong indicators of collisions through the indirect effect on the estimated extinction .",
    "however , they have also larger relative observational uncertainties as compared to h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 , so their actual power to put constraints on collisions depends crucially on the data quality .",
    "since the whole procedure of estimating collisional contribution admittedly skates on thin ice , we chose in this work to rely solely on the more robust constraints provided by h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 .      in this work ,",
    "our approach to the quantitative estimation of collisional enhancement is the following : first , for each object we compute a best - fit model that reproduces the observational constraints , paying particular attention to the ionization structure ; second , we compute , for that particular model , the amount of collisional contribution to h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 ; third , we assess in each case the uncertainty affecting our estimate of the collisional contribution . the last is by far the most difficult step , and there is no unique and completely safe way to undertake it . our strategy to face this problem is to determine the range of collisional contribution spanned by satisfactory models of a given region ( i.e. , how much model - dependent is the collisional contribution ) , and the range of collisional contribution spanned by temperature - enhanced models .",
    "the temperature - enhanced models necessary to realize this last point have been computed with different modeling approximations .",
    "the outcome will be discussed in detail for the three cases in the next sections .",
    "sbs  0335052 is the second most metal - poor galaxy known with @xmath102 z@xmath12 , a metallicity only slightly higher than the one of i zw 18 .",
    "we will start our discussion with this object , because the observational constraints available for sbs  0335052 are by far more numerous and articulate than for the other two objects .",
    "this fact allowed us to build more sophisticated models , and to determine in a more stringent way the collisional contribution to the balmer lines and the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "sbs  0335052 is a roundish region with a redshift @xmath103 @xcite , yielding a distance @xmath104 mpc for @xmath105=72 km s@xmath106 mpc@xmath106 .",
    "@xcite report observations of ionized gas extending over a region of @xmath107 , corresponding to linear dimensions @xmath108 , but the h@xmath33 intensity falls to less than 1/100 of its peak value within a region of angular radius @xmath109 ( figure 2a in * ? ? ?",

    "adding up the fluxes observed by @xcite and @xcite , and subtracting out the portion common to the slits used in the two works ( which were perpendicular to one another ) , we derive as a lower limit to the total intrinsic flux emitted by the region @xmath118 erg s@xmath106 @xmath112 , or a luminosity @xmath119 erg s@xmath106 .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to @xmath120 s@xmath106 ionizing photons ; this number also is a lower limit to the actual number of ionizing photons emitted by the central source , both because it is derived from a lower limit on @xmath29 , and because photons may leak out of the region without producing any @xmath31 . adopting a conservative value of 20 percent photon leak , we estimate @xmath121 s@xmath106 . the root mean square ( rms ) density , derived from the observed h@xmath33 flux , is @xmath122 ; for a filling factor @xmath123 , which is a typical value for giant h  ii regions",

    "does not seem intense enough to produce the observed @xmath38 flux , these authors favor the hypothesis of x - ray binaries ( however , they do not consider the x rays produced by stellar winds and sn explosions through the release of kinetic energy , neither the x - ray emission of sn remnants , although the presence of x - ray binaries implies , at least , one previous sn explosion : see the discussion in section  [ sec : obs_constraints ] ) .",
    "an additional argument invoked to rule out wrs is the spatial distribution of @xmath38 across the nebula , which is displaced from the other nebular lines ; indeed , @xcite find a spatial correlation of the line intensity with the position of a supershell that is probably a shocked region .",
    "a more general argument is that wrs formed through single - star evolution are expected to be very rare at extremely low metallicities .",
    "nevertheless , the spectra taken by @xcite , at a position angle perpendicular to the previous one , show a weak bump around 4620  4640  , suggesting the presence of wr stars , probably of the wn type . in this work ,",
    "we do not make any attempt to reproduce the nebular @xmath38 , due to the loose connection between the wr stars and nebular @xmath38 emission that has been discussed in section  [ sec : obs_constraints ] . on the other hand ,",
    "we take advantage of the observed stellar wr features to constrain the age of the region ; if the wrs of sbs  0335052 have formed through the standard , single - evolution channel , the region must be about @xmath126 myr old .",
    "the observational constraints used in our modeling are the line ratios obtained by @xcite with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer of the keck ii telescope .",
    "they used a @xmath127 slit , centered on the second brightest cluster of the region and oriented sw - ne . from this slit , nine extractions of size @xmath128 were obtained .",
    "our aim is to reproduce the line ratios in the nine extractions simultaneously ; this corresponds to a formidable number of independent , but interrelated , observational constraints , which altogether provide a much firmer handle on the inner structure of the nebula than the integrated properties .",
    "our models of sbs  0335052 are spherically symmetric and have a strmgren radius of approximately @xmath129 pc .",
    "we assume @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the stellar and gas metallicity respectively . since the region is very large , and the stars appear scattered all over the projected surface ( although they are preferentially concentrated towards the center ) , we assume that the star formation is going on in a continuous burst , which began @xmath132 myr ago . to compute the ionizing spectrum",
    ", we adopted the following procedure : we performed 100 monte carlo simulations with 2@xmath133 stars each , assuming an ib case with a time step of 0.1 myr ; each cluster was evolved up to 3.0 myr .",
    "the resulting mean mass of these synthetic clusters is 1.18 @xmath134 m@xmath12 in the range 2  120 m@xmath12 . in order to obtain the spectrum of a csf burst",
    ", these simulations have been summed over time taking randomly a monte carlo simulation for each age .",
    "the mean total stellar mass of the synthetic clusters is 3.5 @xmath135 m@xmath12 , which gives a csf rate of 1.18 m@xmath12 yr@xmath106 . due to the large total mass of this region ,",
    "the statistical fluctuations in the sampling of the imf are very small , and the resulting ionizing spectrum obtained with this procedure is almost identical to the one computed assuming a completely sampled imf .",
    "we adopt as a lower limit to the number of ionizing photons @xmath136 s@xmath106 , a choice leaving us the possibility to increase it to improve the fit of any given model ( see section  [ sec : sbsobs_const ] ) ; this does not pose any theoretical problem from the point of view of the imf sampling , because the imf is well sampled . in the gas",
    "we assume scaled - down solar abundances for all the heavy elements , with the exception of nitrogen and carbon : for these elements , the adopted abundances relative to solar are 1/160 and 1/120 respectively . the helium abundance is @xmath137 .",
    "the starting point for our computations was a radiation bounded model with constant density @xmath138 @xmath139 , filling factor @xmath140 , and covering factor @xmath141 .",
    "based on this reference model , we computed sequences of models varying several parameters : @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath30 , and the density law ; both constant and non - constant density laws were considered , with the last case represented by a gaussian law : @xmath144 .",
    "the output of each model is modified to simulate observations through the nine extractions of the slit used by @xcite ( figure  [ fig : slits ] ) .",
    "most of the weight in the comparison is given to the three most central extractions , since their line intensities have the smallest errors .",
    "the best - fit model obtained from this grid of models , called hereinafter ` gaussian model ' , has the following characteristics : @xmath145 ; gaussian density law , with @xmath146 @xmath139 , @xmath147 @xmath139 , and @xmath148 pc ; @xmath149 ; @xmath150 .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in the reference model described above .",
    "figure  [ fig : sbsgauss ] shows the comparison between the observed and the predicted line profiles for this model ; the points correspond to the line intensities either observed or predicted in each of the nine extractions making up the slit .",
    "the model is , by construction , symmetric with respect to the center , whereas the observed profiles show mild asymmetries : in the modeling , a fit is considered satisfactory whenever the predicted point at any given radius reproduces the average observational point at that radius , obtained averaging the corresponding sw and ne values ; the observational uncertainties are shown as errorbars superposed on the observed profiles .",
    "the top panel shows the h@xmath33 intensity , which is , within the observed uncertainties , very well reproduced by the model .",
    "nevertheless , the three bottom panels show large discrepancies in the projected radial behavior of the ionization degree .",
    "these discrepancies are of special concern because an accurate estimate of collisions requires reproducing the ionization structure of the observed region .",
    "the observed ionization degree is almost constant across the region , a condition which is difficult to reproduce with a radiation bounded , spherical model with a central source of radiation .",
    "physically , the observed profiles can be explained in several ways , for example : ( i ) the region is density bounded , so the low - ionization zone is cut off ; ( ii ) the local density in the outer zones is much lower than assumed by our model , implying a drop in the local recombination rate and , consequently , a higher ionization degree in the outer zones ; ( iii ) the ionizing stars are scattered throughout the region , each creating its own smaller h  ii region with high- and low - ionization zones , the complex of h  ii regions merging with each other .    alternative ( i ) can be excluded on the basis of the relatively low ionization degree , since in a density bounded region the ionization degree is smooth but high",
    ". alternative ( ii ) would imply a simultaneous increase in the filling factor of the outer zones , to preserve the observed h@xmath33 flux ; but such possibility is not too appealing , since the scarce observational evidence regarding this point seems to suggest either the opposite behavior , or a nearly constant filling factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the outer density of the gaussian model is already quite low , so that no much room is left for lowering it further .",
    "alternative ( iii ) is supported by a cursor inspection of direct images of sbs  0335052 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is also the most consistent with the scenario of a csf burst .",
    "direct images also show that the density structure of the region is filamentary , rather than smooth . to take these facts into account and obtain a better fit",
    ", we built a more complicated model that simulates the filamentary distribution of the gas inside sbs  0335052 , and the distribution of the ionizing sources across the cloud .",
    "this model will be described in the next section .      in this section",
    "we present a different model that improves the fit notably .",
    "the new model is the sum of a sequence of thin , constant - density shells , with different radii , and it will therefore be called ` multiple - shell model ' .",
    "since three alternative versions of this model will be presented , all with the same geometrical layout , we will further refer to them as a , b , and c ; multiple - shell model a is the reference one and is described in the following .",
    "each shell composing model a is in itself radiation bounded , and has @xmath27 . in each shell",
    "we could , in principle , independently vary the gas distribution ( local density , filling factor , and covering factor ) ; additionally , we could also vary the number of shells and their inner radii .",
    "we decided rather to fix _ a priori _ the number of shells , their inner radii , and the densities , pushed by several considerations : first , we tried to keep things as simple as possible .",
    "second , the observational data and the modeling experience obtained with the gaussian model provide a good initial guess for the density structure .",
    "third , we want the shells to fill altogether the whole observed region , with no substantial gaps or underlapping , so that , when observed globally , the structure appears fairly smooth : this equals to a constraint on the outer radii , providing directly , with the further constraint on the density , the filling factor value for each region ; the resulting filling factor values decrease smoothly in the outer direction , in agreement with some observational results ( see section  [ sec : sbs : gaussian ] ) .",
    "fourth , in order to obtain a smooth structure without too many computational complications , we fixed the number of shells to be ten .",
    "the covering factor of each shell , which is left as a free variable , is a simple way to describe the filamentary structure of the region : at each radius , photons encounter voids and regions filled with gas , mixed up together ( so that , at the macroscopic level of the slit , voids and clumps are intercepted proportionally to the volume they occupy globally ) .",
    "finally , we still have to take into account that the ionizing stars are scattered throughout the nebula .",
    "this is not possible to compute directly with a 1d code as cloudy ( see @xcite for a discussion on the differences between 1d and 3d codes ) , so we resorted to the following approximation : as far as we proceed from the innermost to the outermost shell , we gradually increase the absolute luminosity of the ionizing source .",
    "this increase reflects the fact that , when stars are scattered throughout the nebula , the outer zones receive a higher flux relatively to the central zones than it occurs in the case of a central source .",
    "the absolute normalization is then achieved by tuning the covering factor of each shell .",
    "the resulting effective covering factor , obtained as the luminosity - weighted average of the covering factors of the individual shells , is @xmath151 .",
    "this shell structure gracefully reproduces the constancy of the ionization degree along the diameter of the nebula : this is a consequence of each shell having its own low- and high - ionization zones . at the same time , the h@xmath33 flux profile is equally well reproduced as in the gaussian case , because the overall density structure is nearly the same .",
    "figure  [ fig : sbsparameters ] summarizes the input parameters of model a , and figure  [ fig : sbsshell ] illustrates the line profiles obtained when the model is observed through the slit .    table  [ tab : sbscomparison ] compares the predicted spectrum to the observational constraints .",
    "the column header `` center '' refers to the centermost extraction .",
    "the label `` @xmath152 '' indicates , in the case of ` observed ' , the average intensities of the two neighbouring extractions ( indicated as  @xmath152sw  and  @xmath152ne  in table  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in the case of ` predicted ' , it indicates the intensities predicted for either of the two extractions situated on both sides of the central extraction .",
    "`` complete slit '' indicates the sum of the nine extractions .",
    "`` complete model '' is given for reference , and it indicates the results for the complete model , with no aperture correction applied : no ` observed ' column exists in this case , since there are no observational data sampling the whole nebula .",
    "the meaning of the column headers is also visually explained by figure  [ fig : slits ] .",
    "the observed @xmath52 values have been computed from the line intensities of @xcite ; we did not use the temperature values reported by these authors , since they only list them for single extractions , i.e. they do not give a value for the complete slit .",
    "for the same reason , the @xmath55 values of table  [ tab : sbscomparison ] differ slightly from the corresponding ones given by @xcite , since we recalculated them in order to fill homogeneously all the slots of table  [ tab : sbscomparison ] . in our calculation",
    "we assumed the same relation as @xcite between @xmath55 and @xmath52 , which is based on a fit to the photoionization models by @xcite .",
    "finally , table  [ tab : sbspredicted ] contains various predicted quantities for model a , and figure  [ fig : sbsratiosii ] compares the observed [ s  ii ] 6716/6731 profile to the corresponding predicted values .",
    "table  [ tab : sbscomparison ] shows that the model systematically underpredicts the temperature of the region .",
    "this disagreement has been a systematic feature in previous attempts of modeling h  ii regions ( see section  [ sec : collisional_effects ] ) , and can be ascribed to an additional energy source acting in photoionization regions , other than photoionization itself .",
    "it can be ignored in most cases when modeling an h  ii region , provided the relevant line ratios are reproduced ; but for our aim , differences of @xmath11 3,000 @xmath153 between the observed and the predicted temperature can not be neglected , because collisional rates are so sensitive to the temperature .",
    "it is therefore necessary to assess how the difference in temperature between the model and the real region affects the collisional enhancement of hydrogen lines : this problem is the topic of next section .      starting from the multiple - shell model a , we follow two different strategies to estimate how the enhanced temperature would affect collisions .",
    "the first strategy consists in computing a new multiple - shell model , named ` model b ' , identical to model a in all respects , with the only exception of the metal abundances , which have been reduced by 1/100 ; in this way , we suppress almost completely the cooling due to metals and obtain higher temperatures . an important feature of this model is that the line profiles are the same as in model a , ensuring that the ionization structure of model b is the same as in model a ; this , in turn , ensures that the dependency of the collisional rates on the ionization degree is well reproduced , a necessary ingredient to draw any conclusion on the relevance of collisions .",
    "the second estimate of the effect of temperature on the collisional rates is a simple numerical experiment , consisting in recomputing the collisional rates at each point assuming a temperature 15 percent higher than the one of the original model .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is just a numerical trick and does not involve any change in the structure of the model : it does not even involve the computation of a new model , since its only effect is to output collisional rates computed with enhanced temperature values ; the collisional rates used internally by the code to determine the equilibrium conditions are left unchanged .",
    "this implies that the computed collisional rates are _ not _ consistent with the model structure .",
    "we named this model ` multiple - shell model c ' .",
    "table  [ tab : sbscollisions ] compares the relative contribution of collisions to the total h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 intensity for the three multiple - shell models .",
    "since model c is not self - consistent , its extremely high collisional rates ( roughly twice those of model b , and four times those of model a ) are probably an artefact . on the other hand ,",
    "model b is totally self - consistent , its [ o  iii ] temperature is very close to the observed one , and so is the observed ionization structure along the slit .",
    "it seems reasonable therefore to assume that the collisional rates found for this model are a good estimate of the real ones .",
    "since model b has almost no metals , its temperature is the highest achievable in a normal h  ii region with photoionization alone .",
    "this temperature is also the highest observed in h  ii regions ( e.g. , sbs  0335052 is even hotter than i  zw  18 ) : hence the collisional enhancement of this model possibly defines an upper limit to what occurs in real h  ii regions .",
    "it is important to stress that there is a completely independent argument supporting the last statement : since the collisional enhancement of balmer lines mimics a higher extinction , the observed reddening values define implicitly an upper limit to the maximum amount of collisional enhancement of each object : see section  [ sec : collisions_obsconstraints ] .",
    "considering the case of the complete slit , we find from table  [ tab : sbscollisions ] that the collisional contribution to h@xmath33 might range from a minimum of 2.1 percent to a maximum of 3.5 percent of the total intensity , with the corresponding contribution to h@xmath32 varying from 7.4 to 11.7 percent . in the first case",
    ", the observed @xmath154h@xmath155h@xmath156 ratio should be corrected by a factor 0.946 , and in the second by a factor 0.915 .",
    "the average @xmath115 observed along the slit should therefore be decreased from the observed value 0.26 dex to a collision - corrected range ( 0.14  0.19 ) dex to get the true extinction .",
    "the collisional reddening coefficients computed for all the cases considered are listed in the last row of table  [ tab : sbscollisions ] .    reversing the reasoning ,",
    "we could find a maximum collisional enhancement for the h@xmath32/h@xmath33 ratio by assuming that the @xmath92 of the region is negligible .",
    "correcting the @xmath115 value with the galactic extinction value by @xcite ( @xmath157 , or @xmath93 = 0.07 dex ) , we find @xmath158 = 0.19 dex .",
    "this amount of collisional reddening could be obtained with a 16 percent collisional enhancement in the ratio @xmath159 ; this in turn would put a rough upper limit on the collisional enhancement equal to @xmath160 , where it has been assumed , based on table  [ tab : sbscollisions ] , that @xmath161 .",
    "i zw 18 is the most metal - poor galaxy known , with @xmath162 z@xmath12 .",
    "given this extremely low metallicity value , it is a key object in the primordial helium analysis , and it has been studied by many authors .",
    "the redshift of the galaxy is @xmath163 @xcite , which gives a distance @xmath164 mpc for @xmath105=72 km s@xmath106 mpc@xmath106 ; its apparent size is roughly @xmath165 , corresponding to linear dimensions 250 pc @xmath166 500 pc at the assumed distance .",
    "i zw 18 is made up of two main regions , usually referred to as the south - east ( se ) and north - west ( nw ) knots .",
    "the nw region is more extended and globally brighter than the se region : the h@xmath33 flux observed by @xcite is @xmath167 erg s@xmath106 @xmath112 in the nw knot erg s@xmath106 @xmath112 , is an erratum ( y. i. izotov 2003 , private communication ) ] , and @xmath168 erg s@xmath106 @xmath112 in the se knot ; the nw knot has been observed with a @xmath169 slit , and the se knot with a @xmath170 slit .",
    "the nebular he  ii line @xmath38 is observed in i zw 18 , with @xmath171 in the nw region , and 0.009 in the se region @xcite ; @xcite observe @xmath38 emission throughout the whole galaxy , with intensities relative to h@xmath33 ranging from 0 to 0.080 .",
    "the spectra of the nw knot show evidence of wr stars @xcite , whereas no stellar wr features have been observed to date in the se knot .    in this work we model the emission from the se knot ;",
    "although less conspicuous than the nw knot , the se knot is less affected by underlying absorption in the helium lines , and is therefore more suitable for a precise determination of the helium abundance in the galaxy . as a drawback of this choice",
    ", it turns out to be quite difficult to estimate the age .",
    "our assumptions regarding this point will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we used as observational constraints the line intensity ratios by @xcite .",
    "as in the case of sbs  0335052 , we modified the model s output to take into account the @xmath172 slit used by @xcite , which samples , at the assumed distance , a region of 77 pc @xmath166 180 pc .    the total h@xmath33 flux observed by @xcite is a lower limit to the total h@xmath33 flux emitted by the se knot , since the se knot has a diameter of approximately @xmath173 . to estimate the total flux , we compared figure  1 in @xcite to figure  3 in @xcite .",
    "the comparison suggests that the slit used by @xcite covered the regions labeled se d1 , se d4 , se d5 , se d6 , and se d7 by @xcite ( although no precise correspondence can be established , due to the scale of the figures and the seeing , which was equal to the width of the slit ) .",
    "the sums of the corresponding h@xmath33 fluxes coincide to better than 15 percent , providing a consistency check for this assumption .",
    "therefore , we will adopt for the total h@xmath33 flux emitted by the region the one given by @xcite for the 8 clumps labeled `` se d1 '' through `` se d8 '' , which is 23 percent higher than the one measured by @xcite .",
    "consistently with our assumption on the total observed h@xmath33 flux , we computed the total @xmath29 as the sum of the @xmath174 values observed by @xcite , each corrected for the corresponding extinction value ; we obtain @xmath175 erg s@xmath106 @xmath112 , a value 56 percent higher than the one by @xcite .",
    "the values of log @xmath19 estimated from the h@xmath33 flux , together with reasonable assumptions on the covering factor ( @xmath176 ) , range from 50.8 to 51.2 ; this would correspond to a total amount of gas transformed into stars of @xmath177 in the mass range 2 - 120 @xmath178 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to a 2 myr burst with log @xmath179 , or about @xmath180 stars , and the upper limit to a 5 myr burst with log @xmath181 , or about 10@xmath5 stars . because these values are quite small , sampling effects in the imf",
    "can not be neglected .",
    "the absence of wr stars in the cluster can not be used to bracket the age , since the models predict , in the most favorable case , 1.6 wr stars on average and a probability of 20 percent of observing no wr stars ; thus , we have no way of knowing whether no wr stars are observed because of the age or because of stochastic effects .",
    "additionally , the spectra of the region show no evidence of balmer jump @xcite , ruling out the presence of old post - ms luminous stars . based on these pieces of evidence",
    ", we have assumed that the main stellar population is composed of ms stars , and have explored relatively young populations ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "the reddening coefficient in i  zw  18 varies strongly from knot nw to knot se , and within the same knot .",
    "for example , recently determined values for the nw knot range from @xmath183  = 0.010 @xcite , to 0.011 @xcite , 0.040 @xcite , and 0.115 @xcite , while those for the se knot range from @xmath183  = 0.20 @xcite , to 0.265 @xcite and 0.015 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite observed i  zw  18 with the hst / wfpc2 finding @xmath183  values in the ( 0.00  0.18 ) range for the nw knot , and in the ( 0.00  0.27 ) range for the se knot .",

    "zw 18 we assume an ib star - formation law ; to obtain the spectrum , we have performed 100 monte carlo simulations of clusters with 1@xmath185 stars , yielding a mean mass of 5.8 @xmath185 m@xmath12 .",
    "the complete set of simulations is shown in figure  [ fig : izw18spectra ] . in the figure",
    "we also show for comparison the results of the analytical simulation corresponding to the same parameters .",
    "as expected , the analytical simulation gives an intermediate value with respect to the ensemble of monte carlo simulations .",
    "since the ionizing flux in i  zw  18 is quite hard , and since the probability of obtaining a cluster in the upper tail of the monte carlo distribution is small but appreciable , we have chosen for our modelization one of the harder spectra .",

    "in analogy to the case of sbs  0335052 , this model has been named model a. the nebular parameters for the model a of i  zw  18 are the following : @xmath131 ; gaussian density law with @xmath187 @xmath139 , @xmath188 @xmath139 , and @xmath189 pc ; @xmath190 ; @xmath191 ; the chemical composition described above ; and a strmgren radius @xmath192 pc .",

    "additionally , i  zw  18 is somewhat colder than sbs  0335052 , so the effect of collisions on hydrogen lines is expected to be smaller .",
    "of bigger concern is the failure to fit the intensities of the low - ionization lines , such as the [ o  ii ] and the [ s  ii ] lines .",
    "however , in this case we have less stringent observational constraints than in the case of sbs  0335052 , and it is not possible to obtain a better model .",

    "probably the radio observations include outer regions of h29 not included in the h@xmath33 measurements ; therefore the comparison between these two figures gives @xmath224 . in the modeling we assumed @xmath225 .",

    "0335052 and i  zw  18 , the predicted temperatures are smaller than the observed ones ; however , the differences in the case of h  29 are far more modest , amounting to a maximum of 650 k for the case of @xmath52 .",
    "additionally , h  29 is much colder than sbs  0335052 , so the effects of collisions on hydrogen lines are certainly more modest , and an underestimation of the temperature has smaller consequences ; for these reasons , we did not compute enhanced - temperature models for this region . table  [ tab : h29collisions ] compares the relative contribution of collisions to the total h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 intensity for the best - fit model , and lists the value of @xmath193 for the best - fit model .",
    "although in the case of h  29 we can not build a sophisticated model , due to the limitations in the observational constraints available , we are confident that the collisional contributions estimated by means of the model presented here are representative of the real situation , on the following grounds : first , the temperature of this region is quite low , so that collisions are not very important ; second , the temperature of our model is a good approximation of the temperature of h  29 ; third , h  29 is small and compact , so that less structure than in the case of sbs  0335052 is expected , making the need for spatially resolved observations less stringent ; fourth , the reddening coefficient of this region is very low , so that the upper limit on collisional enhancement placed by the observed reddening is also quite low .",
    "the galactic reddening towards h  29 is @xmath194 according to @xcite , and @xmath231 according to @xcite , implying @xmath232 dex . after subtracting this contribution from the total observed reddening @xmath233 dex , we find that the maximum amount of collisional enhancement for the ratio @xmath159 is 4 percent , implying a maximum collisional enhancement of 1.5 percent for @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , in objects with high electronic temperatures , the lower balmer lines may be collisionally enhanced . if the collisional contribution is not subtracted out from the total intensity of each line , it may result in spuriously low he / h ratios .",
    "since high temperatures characterize low - metallicity objects , which are crucial for the determination of primordial helium , the derived @xmath0 is consequently underestimated .",
    "@xcite estimated that the effect in i  zw  18 is roughly 2 percent for @xmath234 , and a third of that for @xmath235 .",
    "the effect of collisional excitation of balmer lines on the determination of @xmath0 has been discussed by several authors after @xcite ( @xcite ; paper  i ) .",
    "@xcite remarked that , because collisions affect more h@xmath32 than h@xmath33 , collisions introduce an extra - reddening in the balmer spectrum , which should be subtracted out before the abundance analysis is performed .",
    "altogether , they estimate that neglect of collisional excitation of balmer lines may result in an underestimate of @xmath0 by as much as 5 percent . in paper",
    "i , the effect of collisional enhancement of balmer lines was found to increase @xmath0 by @xmath236 , corresponding to 1 percent . in the following",
    ", we will revise these results in the light of the improved models presented in this paper , and derive a new determination of @xmath0 .",
    "from an h@xmath32/h@xmath33 map of i  zw  18 obtained from narrowband hst / wfpc2 images of the galaxy , @xcite find that the h@xmath32/h@xmath33 ratio was not homogenous , presenting values ranging from 2.75 to 3.40 .",
    "after discarding several alternative explanations for these enhanced ratios , they interpret these variations in terms of dust patches in the galaxy .",
    "in particular , they argue against the possibility of collisional enhancement of h@xmath32/h@xmath33 based on the following line of reasoning : a ) the highest ratios are observed in the sw knot , which is the one with the lower temperature ; b ) the observed ratios do not seem to follow any definite trend with the ionization parameter .",
    "the line of reasoning expressed in the second point above might be challenged , based on the following considerations . in photoionization models ,",
    "the collisional contribution reaches in general its maximum at some point halfway the center and the strmgren radius , so the observed gradient depends on the exact interplay bewteen @xmath47 and the @xmath237 ratio of the particular model , with the projection and aperture effects taken into account .",
    "thus , even for a model nebula , it would be extremely difficulty to give a prescription for what the gradient in the collisional contribution is expected to be .",
    "one example is provided in figure  [ fig : h29profiles ] , which shows the behavior of various predicted quantities .",
    "the upper panel a ) contains the radial behavior of the ratio between the collisional and the recombination emissivities of h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 ; note the abrupt rise of the curves near the strmgren radius , which is a consequence of the increase in the fraction of neutral hydrogen outweighing the fall in temperature .",
    "panel b ) shows the incremental contribution of each shell to the total luminosities , with the volume factor taken into account ; to translate this figure into an observational prediction , one should further consider the projection effect , which in turn depends on the aperture ; nevertheless , the bumps in the plot makes it clear that the dependence of luminosity on radius is something difficult to figure out a priori .",
    "finally , panel c ) illustrates the radial behavior of the hydrogen ionization fractions , and panel d ) the radial behavior of the electron temperature and density . in the case of a real nebula ,",
    "it is only reasonable to assume that things are far more complicated , and no specific shape for the gradient can be expected .",
    "one consideration supporting this conclusion is that the individual h  ii regions of different stars or small star clusters merge with one another , a fact that makes it even more difficult to make small - scale predictions on the radial behavior of any quantity .",
    "more in general , the concept of ionization parameter is tricky and should be used with caution : one reason is that several alternative definitions exist , and it is not always clear which one is being used ; a second fact to consider is that most of them refer to the simplest cases of a central ionizing source and constant gas density , and things can change a lot when these hypotheses are relaxed . in short , if the concept of ionization parameter is used as a synonim of global ionization degree , it would be better to use the last expression , since it is more precise and univocal ; if it refers to something else , it should be specified which definition is being used , and how it can be applied to the case of a real nebula with spread - out ionizing sources and radially changing density and filling factor .    nevertheless , we agree with the conclusions by @xcite , that the main process causing h@xmath32/h@xmath33 to depart from its theoretical value is dust extinction , on the following grounds : adopting for the expected recombination ratio ( h@xmath32/h@xmath33)@xmath238 = 2.76 as in @xcite , the individual ratios measured throughout the region differ from the expected ratio from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 23 percent , averaging 8 percent .",
    "these values yield for the total reddening coefficients @xmath115 values from 0 to 0.27 dex .",
    "if an average foreground extinction @xmath239 dex is subtracted out ( section  [ sec : izw18collisions ] , which agrees with the estimate by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the residual reddening amounts to values ranging from 0 to 0.24 dex , averaging 0.07 dex .",
    "if we were to explain such reddening in terms of pure collisional enhancement , this effect would imply a 7 percent enhancement on average in the h@xmath32 intensity  three times more than estimated by @xcite  , and a 22 percent enhancement in the most extreme case  eleven times more than estimated by @xcite .",
    "this values seem too extreme , and support the conclusion by @xcite of internal dust extinction .      summarizing the conclusions drawn in sections  [ sec : sbscollisions ] ,",
    "[ sec : izw18collisions ] and [ sec : h29collisions ] , we will correct the observed @xmath183 values for the three objects with our estimate of the collisional contribution .",
    "table  [ tab : chbeta ] lists the observed and collision - corrected reddening coefficients .",
    "the uncertainties have been computed as follows : for the case of sbs  0335052 , we assumed as the best estimate for @xmath193 the values predicted with model b , the one that best fits both the temperature and the ionization structure ; the uncertainty on @xmath193 was assumed equal to the difference between the values predicted by models a and b. the @xmath115 values were formally derived from the published line fluxes .",
    "for the case of i  zw  18 , we assumed the @xmath193 value obtained with model a : we did not adopt the higher value given by model b , as in the case of sbs  0335052 , because model b is hotter than the observations ( section  [ sec : izw18collisions ] ) , and because the predicted collisional enhancement would be too high as compared to the observed reddening : see section  [ sec : izw18collisions ] .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath193 was assumed equal to the difference between the values predicted by models a and b. the assumed @xmath115 value is the one inferred from the data by @xcite , and the uncertainty by @xcite was assumed .    for the case of h  29 we assumed the @xmath193 value obtained with model a , and assumed the same uncertainty as in i  zw  18 .",
    "this choice is somewhat arbitrary , but it is supported by the following considerations : first , the observational data available to constrain models of h  29 are scarce and not high - quality ; second , the temperatures of the model are in fair agreement with the observed ones : hence , it is reasonable to assume that the absolute uncertainty affecting our estimation should not be too large ; third , the temperatures ( both observed and predicted ) are quite low in absolute terms , so it would be unreasonable to assume a large collisional contribution , as it would be implied by a large uncertainty ; fourth , a larger uncertainty would contradict the assumed @xmath115 value . as for @xmath115 ,",
    "the assumptions underlying the number quoted have already been discussed in section  [ sec : h29chb ] .",
    "in this section , we will redetermine the helium abundance in the three h  ii regions , taking into account the collisional contribution to the balmer lines .",
    "we will then show how the revised determination affects the derived @xmath0 value .      as discussed in section  [ sec : collisions_theorovw ] , the abundance analysis of h  ii regions can suffer from a bias if the collisional enhancement of hydrogen lines is neglected .",
    "the bias arises from two different effects : the first is an overestimation of the hydrogen recombination intensity , from which an underestimation of the he@xmath16/h@xmath16 ratio directly descends ; the second effect is a consequence of the collisional reddening of the balmer spectrum , which causes an overestimation of the extinction , and therefore an underestimation of the intensity of the red helium lines .",
    "both effects act in the same direction , increasing the value of @xmath1 : they will be illustrated quantitatively in this section , where we present three different determinations of the helium abundance . in the first we neglect the collisional effects in the hydrogen lines",
    "; in the second we subtract the collisional contribution from the observed @xmath29 , but we neglect the collisional effects on the observed reddening ; finally , in the third we subtract the collisional contribution from both @xmath29 and @xmath115 .",
    "in addition to the collisional contribution to the balmer lines , to obtain he@xmath16/h@xmath16 values we need a set of effective recombination coefficients for the helium and hydrogen lines , an estimate of the optical depth effects for the he  i lines , and the contribution to the he  i line intensities due to collisional excitation . as in paper",
    "i , we used a maximum likelihood method ( mlm ) to derive the he@xmath16/h@xmath16 values .",
    "we used the hydrogen recombination coefficients by @xcite , and the helium recombination coefficients by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we will assume that @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the oxygen abundance by mass .",
    "the @xmath252 baseline given by the objects in this sample is very small and consequently produces large errors in the @xmath253 determination : therefore we adopted @xmath254 , a value based on observations and models of chemical evolution of irregular galaxies @xcite .",

    "this is a valid procedure if one only considers the errors in the extrapolation to @xmath255 .",
    "nevertheless , the collisional effect increases with the electron temperature , thus for very low metallicities the error due to collisions can become very large . in fact , the errors due to collisions for objects with @xmath256 can become larger than the errors due to the extrapolation for objects with @xmath257 ; therefore , the second set of objects allows to achieve a higher accuracy in the determination of @xmath0 .    from the sample made of the three objects",
    "sbs  0335052 , i  zw  18 , and h  29 we derive the following results : ( i ) @xmath258 , neglecting the collisional effects in the balmer lines ; ( ii ) @xmath259 , subtracting the collisional contribution from the h@xmath33 intensity , and neglecting the collisional effects on the observed reddening ; ( iii ) @xmath260 , correcting both @xmath29 and @xmath183 for collisional effects .",
    "this is , however , a very small sample : if we consider the larger sample presented in paper i , which includes ngc 2363 and ngc 346 in addition to the regions studied in this work , the @xmath0 values obtained in the three cases become respectively @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath4 .",
    "there are three main procedures to estimate the collisional contribution to the hydrogen line intensities in giant h  ii regions .",
    "the first , which is observational , is the measurement of @xmath115 ; the difference between @xmath115 and @xmath93 sets an upper limit to the amount of collisions ; no lower limit can be found through this method .",
    "the second method is based on the use of generic grids of photoionization models ; although this procedure allows establishing both a lower and an upper limit to collisional contribution , such limits are not necessarily more stringent than those set with the first method .",
    "furthermore , this method gives no handle on the effect of temperature fluctuations , which is an important source of uncertainty .",
    "the third method is the computation of tailored photoionization models : although more precise than the use of generic grids of photoionization models , this method is extremely time - consuming ; furthermore , it suffers from the same bias , since photoionization models are generally unable to reproduce the temperatures observed in actual h  ii regions .",
    "this difficulty may in some way be skipped by resorting to ingenious ways of taking the temperature bias into account , as we did in the cases of sbs  0335052 and i  zw  18 , but this procedure introduces an additional uncertainty that derives from the impossibility to predict the spatial correlation of the temperature to the ionization structure .",
    "the best solution available at present is the simultaneous use of all the methods described above .",
    "this approach allows to put more stringent constraints on the amount of collisions than any of the individual methods taken separately ; it also allows to estimate the uncertainty attached to these estimates in a relatively safe way , and to propagate it into the value of @xmath0 . a further refinement of this technique is at present impossible , and could come only from the availability of high - quality , spatially resolved data for a few selected objects : spatial resolution is necessary because it allows to compute better photoionization models .    from the point of view of the determination of @xmath0 , a different solution to",
    "the problem is to avoid the use of extremely low - metallicity objects , and to concentrate instead on obtaining high - quality data for an adequate sample of moderately low - metallicity objects .",
    "this solution was already hinted at by @xcite .",
    "although for this class of objects the uncertainty on @xmath10 is amplified , the uncertainty introduced by collisions is smaller , with a global positive tradeoff .",
    "in this work , we presented tailored photoionization models for the three metal - poor extragalactic h  ii regions sbs  0335052 , i  zw  18 , and h  29 . in the modeling we put special care in the determination of the collisional contribution to the balmer line intensities , and gave estimates of the uncertainties affecting such determination . an accurate determination of the collisional contribution to the balmer lines requires a detailed modeling of both the temperature and the ionization structure of the nebulae .",
    "although the uncertainties affecting these quantities are generally large , we showed in this work that the collisional contribution can be estimated in a rather precise way by means of the simultaneous use of alternative constraints .",
    "the most powerful constraint is provided by the observed reddening coefficient @xmath115 . in the three objects considered in this work the @xmath115 values are quite low , putting a very stringent upper limit to the amount of collisions .",

    "* who suggested that the h@xmath32/h@xmath33 enhancement could reach values as high as 8 percent ) ; more specifically , we can draw from this study quantitative conclusions on the correction to be applied to actual @xmath0 determinations , because our sample contains two of the objects that have played a determining role in the past determinations of @xmath0 .",

    "<S> this paper describes a new determination of the primordial helium abundance ( @xmath0 ) , based on the abundance analysis of five metal - poor extragalactic h  ii regions . for three regions of the sample ( sbs  0335052 , i  zw  18 , and h  29 ) we present tailored photoionization models based on improved calculations with respect to previous models . in particular , we use the photoionization models to study quantitatively the effect of collisional excitation of balmer lines on the determination of the helium abundance ( @xmath1 ) in the individual regions . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is twofold : first , the intensities of the balmer lines are enhanced with respect to the pure recombination value , mimicking a higher hydrogen abundance ; second , the observed reddening is larger than the true extinction , due to the differential effect of collisions on different balmer lines . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these effects , our analysis takes into account the following features of h  ii regions : ( i ) the temperature structure , ( ii ) the density structure , ( iii ) the presence of neutral helium , ( iv ) the collisional excitation of the he  i lines , ( v ) the underlying absorption of the he  i lines , and ( vi ) the optical thickness of the he  i lines . </S>",
    "<S> the object that shows the highest increase in @xmath1 after the inclusion of collisional effects in the analysis is sbs  0335052 , whose helium abundance has been revised by @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the revised @xmath1 values for the five objects in our sample yield an increase of @xmath3 in @xmath0 , giving @xmath4 . </S>"
