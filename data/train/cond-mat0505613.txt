    "it has recently been proposed that a new type of superconductivity exists in the heavy fermion cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  under high pressure@xcite . in this compound ,",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 is enhanced near 3@xmath0gpa from its ambient pressure value of 0.7@xmath0k to around 2.5@xmath0k .",
    "the proposed pairing mechanism at high pressure is based on the exchange of critical valence fluctuations close to a ( nearly ) first order valence transition of the ce ion at a pressure @xmath5 4.5@xmath0gpa . at ambient pressure in contrast ,",
    "critical magnetic fluctuations are believed to mediate the superconductivity .",
    "the magnetically ordered state , which in pure cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  competes with the superconducting state is thought to disappear at a magnetic quantum critical point at a small positive pressure @xmath6 of approximately 0.1@xmath0gpa @xcite . this quantum critical point is masked by the superconducting state in pure samples , but can be directly observed by substituting ge for si which leads to a suppression of superconductivity @xcite .    the necessary background to this work can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides the context for the results and discussion reported below , and should be read in conjunction with this paper .",
    "the most important point to remember is that there is a second critical pressure @xmath3  where the occupation number @xmath7 of the electronic @xmath8-orbitals on the ce atom changes abruptly .",
    "this can be thought of as analogous to the ce @xmath9 transition , though with the critical endpoint at very low , or perhaps negative temperature ( the latter leading to a crossover rather than a first order transition ) .",
    "the system goes from a kondo regime ( @xmath10 ) to that with characteristics of an intermediate valence state ( where @xmath11 ) .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath2  near @xmath3 , mediated by critical valence fluctuations , was predicted by an extended anderson model including an extra coulomb repulsion term @xmath12 between the conduction @xmath4- and @xmath8-electrons  @xcite .",
    "a series of anomalies in the normal state electronic properties was also predicted , and these have been observed to occur around this pressure .",
    "they include a large enhancement of the residual resistivity @xmath13 , an enhancement of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath14 , and a resistivity linear in temperature , @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this simple model is surprisingly successful in describing the observed behaviour in cecu@xmath1si@xmath1 , and can help to provide the basis for a more complete description of the behaviour of related systems .",
    "however , there are further experimental facts beyond its scope , which may prove useful guidance towards a more complete understanding of the microscopic physics involved .",
    "the superconducting and magnetic properties of cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  at ambient pressure are highly sensitive to small changes in composition and disorder @xcite , but there has been little systematic investigation into similar effects at high pressure .",
    "the ground state at ambient pressure depends strongly on the exact stoichiometry of the sample , giving so - called types a , a / s and s , where the magnetically ordered ` a phase ' competes with the superconducting state ` s ' .",
    "ishikawa @xcite recently proposed a further subdivision of cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  properties , into so - called ` low @xmath2 ' and ` high @xmath2 ' types , with differing signs in the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the isostructural compound cepd@xmath1si@xmath1  has been shown to be extremely sensitive to uniaxial stress under pressure .",
    "dramatic variations in @xmath2 in cepd@xmath1si@xmath1  result from a change in crystalline orientation with respect to small non - hydrostatic components in a bridgman anvil pressure cell with a quasi - hydrostatic steatite medium @xcite .    with these facts in mind",
    ", we wished to systematically explore , via resistance measurements under pressure , how the electronic properties around @xmath3  depended on the sample , and on the pressure conditions ; especially to see how valence - fluctuation mediated superconductivity in cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  is affected by the presence of disorder and uniaxial stress .",
    "the results previously obtained in a hydrostatic helium pressure medium @xcite provide a baseline for comparison .",
    "resistivity measurements under pressure on a total of six cecu@xmath1si@xmath1samples from two different sources are reported below .",
    "there were two polycrystalline samples , of type ` low-@xmath2 ' and ` high-@xmath2 ' , respectively labelled # 50 and # 57 and prepared by ishikawa s group by a levitation method ; the remaining four samples were a / s type single crystals from the same original source crystal prepared at the mpi dresden .",
    "the latter crystal were grown in an al@xmath1o@xmath16 crucible by a modified bridgman technique using cu excess as flux medium @xcite .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction confirmed the tetragonal thcr@xmath1si@xmath1 structure with lattice parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "specific heat measurements display a large mean field like anomaly at @xmath19k followed by a large peak at @xmath20k . according to the strong difference in their magnetic field dependence",
    ", these anomalies can be attributed to the transition into the magnetic a - phase and into the superconducting state , respectively .",
    "the large size of the anomalies proves that both transitions are bulk ones .",
    "two different pressure runs are reported in this paper , referred to below as cell # 1 ( containing four samples from all sources ) and # 2 ( with two a / s samples ) using a bridgman anvil cell technique with a quasi - hydrostatic steatite solid pressure medium .",
    "pressure gradients are believed to be less than 5% of the total at the highest pressures , determined from the width of the superconducting transition of pb manometer .",
    "the first cell ( # 1 ) contained the two polycrystals # 50 and # 57 and two a / s type single crystals , oriented with the measurement current parallel to the @xmath4- and @xmath21-axes , and labelled ` a / s @xmath22 ' and ` a / s @xmath23 ' respectively .",
    "the current direction was perpendicular to the axis of the pressure cell , and we believe though unfortunately are not certain , that the @xmath4-axis of sample ` a / s @xmath23 ' was oriented parallel to the cell axis .     cell # 2 , containing two a / s samples cut from neighbouring positions on the same source crystal .",
    "they are oriented with their @xmath4-axes parallel and perpendicular to the cell axis , and the current flows along the @xmath21 direction . ]",
    "any uniaxial stresses due to an imperfectly hydrostatic pressure medium are likely to be aligned with the cell axis , and the second pressure cell ( # 2 ) , fig .  [",
    "fig : strainphoto ] , was designed to exploit this systematically .",
    "the cell contained two samples , both cut from neighbouring positions on the same a / s type single crystal source .",
    "they were both oriented so that the current flowed along the @xmath21 direction , while the @xmath4-axis was oriented parallel and perpendicular to the cell axis .",
    "the samples have been labelled ( @xmath24 )  and ( @xmath25 )  respectively .",
    "multiple contacts on each sample enabled the resistivity within different regions of the same sample to be compared . as they shared their longest side in the original source crystal , variations in composition along the length of one sample",
    "should be comparable to that between samples .",
    "the resistivity was first measured at p=0 ; excellent agreement was found with previous results .",
    "apart from the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 , several features of the normal state resistivity under pressure will be highlighted .",
    "these are the residual resistivity @xmath13 and @xmath26 coefficient of the temperature dependence in the power law behaviour @xmath27 of the normal state at low temperature , and the position of the two crystal - field split resistivity maxima @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "all of these show distinctive features at the valence instability pressure @xmath3 .",
    "the resistance has been normalized by the geometric factor of each sample measured on construction of the cell , which usually gives an absolute value within 10% for proper four - point measurements .",
    "contrary to cell # 2 , which provided straightforward results , the gasket of cell # 1 formed under too high a load , and due to migration of the contact wires , full four - point resistance measurements were possible in only one of the samples ( # 50 ) .",
    "the resistance measured for the other samples contained an additional series contribution , of varying size .",
    "it would be possible to subtract this , for example assuming a linear additional term and/or an adjustment of the geometric factor used to obtain the absolute resistivity , but the results obtained will then depend on these assumptions .",
    "we should add that obtaining even semi - quantitative values for the absolute resistivity at such high pressures is a challenging task , therefore we make no apology for trying to extract the maximum amount of information from what might be seen as an imperfect experiment .",
    "normal state resistivity at @xmath2  in cell # 1 , showing the enhancement of @xmath13 at @xmath3 .",
    "note that only sample # 50 had full four - point contacts , so the others contain a monotonically decreasing additional contribution to the resistance , but the sample contribution is visible in all . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho0 ] , one can easily see the enhancement of the residual resistivity at @xmath3  in all samples in cell # 1 , superimposed in three cases on a monotonically decreasing additional series resistance .",
    "it is clear that the enhancement of the residual resistivity in sample # 50 ( the sample with four electrical contacts ) is much larger than in the others , and reaches almost 200@xmath30 cm close to 5@xmath0gpa .",
    "this sample also has a small negative magnetoresistance at 5.5@xmath0gpa , around 0.5% at 8@xmath0 t and 4.2@xmath0k , in contrast to the other samples which show a positive magnetoresistance .",
    "this is typical of cecu@xmath1si@xmath1samples with very high residual resistivities at @xmath3 , and perhaps due to the zeeman shift of the @xmath8-level @xmath31 , moving the system away from the valence instability .",
    "resistivity of the ` low @xmath2 ' ( # 50 , unadjusted ) and ` high @xmath2 ' ( # 57 , adjusted , see text ) samples in cell # 1 at 4.34 gpa .",
    "note the extremely large residual resistivity of # 50 , yet a nearly complete superconducting transition is observed . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5057p4 ] , samples # 50 and # 57 are compared at 4.34@xmath0gpa , close to the maximum of @xmath13 . to compensate for experimental difficulties ,",
    "the resistivity of # 57 has been adjusted slightly to give zero resistance below @xmath2 , and to match that of # 50 at room temperature .",
    "this was done by subtracting a small constant contact resistance and slightly adjusting the geometric factor , each corresponding to about 10% of the unadjusted data .",
    "the resulting resistivity curve is typical of cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  at this pressure . in sample # 50 however , there is evidently an enormously enhanced impurity contribution to the total resistivity , with a negative temperature dependence reminiscent of a kondo impurity system , in addition to the usual scattering which increases up to @xmath32 .",
    "a negative slope becomes apparent at higher pressure where the @xmath26 coefficient of the resistivity has collapsed and the impurity contribution dominates the resistivity .",
    "the two samples regain very similar behaviour on approaching room temperature .",
    "we should add that this sort of behaviour , where superconductivity coexists with very high residual resistivity , has also been observed in single crystals @xcite .",
    "the existence of samples which superconduct at high pressure despite such enormous residual resistivities , of the order of the ioffe - regel limit ( which is around 100@xmath30 cm at ambient pressure ) , is strong evidence in favour of valence fluctuation mediated pairing .",
    "the common view is that unconventional superconductivity is incompatible with large electronic scattering rates .",
    "however , in this case both the superconductivity and the enhanced impurity scattering may share a common origin , as we believe that valence fluctuations are responsible for both the pairing interaction and the renormalization of impurity potentials @xcite .",
    "the superconducting pressure range is extended considerably in three out of four samples .",
    "only sample ` a / s @xmath23 ' showed the expected total disappearance of superconductivity above 7@xmath0gpa . ]",
    "figure [ fig : tconset ] shows the onset temperature of the superconducting transition @xmath33  for the samples in cell # 1 .",
    "the most remarkable feature is that in three out of four samples , the superconducting region extends up to a much higher pressure than seen in hydrostatic conditions . only in sample ` a / s @xmath23 ' was @xmath33  suppressed at high pressures similar to the result observed in the helium cell .",
    "the transitions at the highest pressures are partial , but there is a clear drop in resistance below @xmath33 .",
    "very broad resistive transitions are intrinsic to cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  at high pressure , and have been identified as due to filamentary superconductivity rather than to pressure gradients @xcite .",
    "the superconducting state at very high pressure may therefore be solely of a filamentary nature .",
    "the enhanced @xmath33  at very high pressure is a clear indication of the sensitivity of the high pressure superconducting state to anisotropy , either via the current direction , or anisotropic pressure conditions .",
    "cell # 2 was designed to test the effect of anisotropic stress , in analogy to similar work on cepd@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the two samples were aligned at right angles with respect to the cell axis .",
    "we might expect the slight uniaxial stress associated with the solid pressure medium to be oriented along this axis .",
    "the superconducting and normal state properties did indeed differ between the two samples in a way which corresponded to more than just a shift of the pressure scale , which might be expected if each sample was simply sampling part of an inhomogeneous pressure distribution .",
    "onset @xmath33(dotted lines ) , and completion @xmath34 ( continuous lines ) temperatures in cell # 2 compared with helium cell results .",
    "two results are shown for samples ( @xmath24 )  ( open circles ) and ( @xmath25 )  ( filled squares ) , taken from measurements using different contacts on the same sample .",
    "the differences in @xmath2  between samples are significantly larger than local variations within a single sample . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : straintc ] shows the onset @xmath33 , and completion @xmath34 temperatures of the resistive superconducting transition for samples ( @xmath24 )  and ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath34 has been previously identified with the bulk superconducting transition @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the extension of @xmath33above 6@xmath0gpa seen in cell # 1 was not reproduced , indeed both samples in cell # 2 follow the pressure dependence of ` a / s @xmath23 ' fairly closely .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath2 between the two samples is an order of magnitude larger than within each .",
    "there is a slight enhancement of @xmath2 in sample ( @xmath24 ) , and a very clear difference in the shape of the resistive transitions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the lack of extension of the superconducting region to very high pressure in cell # 2 does not entirely rule out uniaxial stress as the explanation for such behaviour in cell # 1 ; the gasket instability in the latter probably lead to higher non - hydrostatic stresses inside the pressure cell .",
    "the normal state properties provide a much clearer picture of the effect of uniaxial stress on cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  under pressure .",
    "this can be most simply described as a shift of the valence instability @xmath3 to higher pressure in sample ( @xmath25 )  than in ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have previously identified @xmath3  with several anomalies in the normal state resistivity , including :    * merging of the crystal field split kondo resistivity maxima @xmath28 and @xmath29 . * a maximum in the residual resistivity @xmath13 . * a sudden change in the @xmath26 coefficient of the resistivity @xmath35 , and a change of the @xmath36 scaling .",
    "the shift of @xmath3  is evident in all three properties , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tmaxrho0 ] & [ fig : strainavstmax ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmaxrho0](a ) , one can see that @xmath28 , proportional to the kondo temperature @xmath37 , rises faster in sample ( @xmath24 )  than in ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath29 , which reflects the crystal field splitting @xmath38 , is difficult to distinguish above the lowest pressure , but it has been shown to remain more or less constant @xcite .",
    "the two crystal - field split resistivity peaks merge into a single maximum at different pressures in the two samples , and this corresponds approximately to the @xmath13 maximum .",
    "the latter is shown in fig .  [ fig : tmaxrho0](b ) , where a lorentzian peak can be fitted to the variation of @xmath13 . note that the values of @xmath13 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmaxrho0](b ) are extracted from a power law fit to the resistivity above @xmath2 , so the very low values at 0.6@xmath0gpa may be slightly anomalous .",
    "the presence of the a phase at ambient pressure also makes direct comparison difficult .",
    "( a ) the crystal field split kondo resistivity maxima @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( defined in inset ) merge at a higher pressure in sample ( @xmath25 )  ( filled symbols ) than in ( @xmath24 )  ( empty symbols ) .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath28 is smaller than the symbol size .",
    "( b ) the residual resistivity maxima in the two samples corresponds approximately to the pressures determined in ( a ) .",
    "@xmath3  is therefore at a higher pressure in ( @xmath25 )  than in ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the same symbols at a given pressure correspond to measurements from different contacts on the same sample .",
    "]     there is a drop in @xmath39 of more than an order of magnitude at the valence transition , at different pressures for each sample .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding change of the @xmath40 scaling expected due to the kadowaki - woods relation ( solid lines ) .",
    "he cell results ( open circles ) using a quadratic fit are included in the inset . ]",
    "the shift of @xmath3  determined above corresponds to a difference of around 0.5@xmath0gpa between ( @xmath25 )  and ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is confirmed when the @xmath26 coefficient of the resistivity is examined ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strainavstmax ] ) .",
    "the analysis is slightly complicated by the non - fermi liquid behaviour of the resistivity found in the entire region around @xmath6 and @xmath3 , where exponents @xmath41 are found in power law resistivity fits @xmath42 .",
    "however in this case a reasonable comparison is still possible on a logarithmic scale , since there is a drop in @xmath39 of over an order of magnitude at @xmath3 , and even without forcing a quadratic fit , the variations in @xmath43 can only contribute a maximum factor of two to the result . at higher pressure ( above 6@xmath0gpa ) , the temperature dependent impurity scattering dominated the resistivity and made it impossible to obtain a reliable fit . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : strainavstmax ] , where @xmath39 is plotted against @xmath28 , indicates the crossover from the strongly to weakly correlated branches of the kadowaki - woods plot @xcite . a comparison with the helium cell results from ref .",
    "@xcite ( where a quadratic fit was forced ) shows that the drop in @xmath39 around 5@xmath0gpa corresponds to the transition between the two regions where the expected @xmath40 scaling is followed ( indicated by solid lines ) .",
    "the result is clear .",
    "the two samples track each other up to 4.5@xmath0gpa , after which the drop in @xmath39 occurs more quickly in ( @xmath24 )  than ( @xmath25 ) , confirming that ( @xmath24 )  has reached the valence transition at a lower pressure .",
    "ishikawa attributed the differences at ambient pressure between ` low @xmath2 ' and ` high @xmath2 ' type cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  to different pairing symmetries @xcite .",
    "normal state and superconducting properties at ambient pressure differed considerably between the two categories of sample , which were located in regions side by side the homogeneity range @xcite .",
    "the ` low @xmath2 ' samples were characterized by a slight excess of copper , and a higher residual resistivity .",
    "however , specific heat measurements showed a more robust superconducting transition in the ` low @xmath2 ' than the ` high @xmath2 ' samples . despite the difference in @xmath44 previously observed close to @xmath45 , the ` low @xmath2 ' and ` high @xmath2 ' samples both displayed the usual enhancement of @xmath2  at high pressure .",
    "the most striking difference was seen in the residual resistivity , which reached huge levels in sample # 50 around @xmath3 .",
    "given that both samples had very similar but not identical compositions , we might speculate on the origin of this . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , there appeared to be no significant difference in crystal structure between the two categories of sample .",
    "the exact location of any atomic disorder may be highly significant , as the enhancement of impurity scattering is due to critical fluctuations @xcite and the effect may well depend significantly on the nature and location of the impurity itself , not only at @xmath3 , but also @xmath6 . the effect of disorder on @xmath2  noted by yuan et al .",
    "@xcite , suggests that the initial reduction in @xmath2with pressure in the ` low @xmath2 ' samples is due to such ( possibly enhanced ) impurity scattering , suppressing superconductivity between the two critical points .",
    "the a / s type cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  shows a similar enhancement of @xmath2  at high pressure to the sample measured in hydrostatic conditions .",
    "all other samples , including those of other types , have shown the enhancement of @xmath2 when pressurized to over 3@xmath0gpa .",
    "regarding both the properties at ambient pressure and around @xmath3 , the evidence so far seems to suggest only that the a@xmath46a / s@xmath46s series represents a slight shift of the pressure scale .",
    "thus any individual cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  sample can be classified by two or maybe three variables , corresponding to the aforementioned pressure shift , and to the impurity concentration ( and perhaps also to the nature of the disorder ) .    regarding the effect of uniaxial stress on cecu@xmath1si@xmath1 , monthoux and lonzarich",
    "have shown that a more anisotropic structure leads to an increase in @xmath2  for both magnetic and density fluctuation mediated pairing @xcite . in the ce115 systems , and related pu compounds , it has also been shown that @xmath2  is strongly dependent on the ratio of the tetragonal lattice parameters @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "while the exact effect of the quasihydrostatic medium is hard to quantify , our observations are not inconsistent with these scenarios .",
    "this does not necessarily help to distinguish between spin and valence - fluctuation mediated superconductivity , but it provides a constraint which must be satisfied by any more complete theoretical model .",
    "further avenues for exploration from both a theoretical and experimental point of view come from the highly anisotropic resistivity , including some evidence that @xmath2 , as defined by zero resistivity , may depend on current direction !",
    "one clear result not so far mentioned is that the height of the resistivity peak at @xmath28 is significantly larger for @xmath23 than @xmath22 .",
    "this is not the case for the magnitude of @xmath48 , reflecting the higher symmetry of the higher - lying crystal field split @xmath8-states .",
    "the effect of the cef on the anisotropy of the resistivity in cecu@xmath1si@xmath1was analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize again the importance of the coexistence of superconductivity and very high residual resistivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5057p4 ] .",
    "this is perhaps the most compelling evidence so far for a novel pairing mechanism in cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  at high pressure .",
    "resistivity measurements were carried out at high pressure on several different cecu@xmath1si@xmath1  samples , in the presence of small non - hydrostatic stress components .",
    "all samples showed an enhancement of superconductivity around 23@xmath0gpa , and also an enhancement of residual resistivity with a maximum around 5@xmath0gpa .",
    "complete resistive superconducting transitions can coexist with residual resistivities of the order of 150200@xmath30 cm around the valence instability close to 5@xmath0gpa .",
