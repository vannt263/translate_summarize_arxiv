    "looking into the lc of sn  2009kr as an example , a substantial lc drop is observed at around 60 days after the peak .",
    "this kind of the lc drop is observed in several rapidly fading sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the lc drop caused by the recombination wave reaching the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope in the model with @xmath34",
    "is found at around 50  days after the peak and there is only a difference of about 10  days .",
    "a significant difference between our numerical lcs and observed ones is in the existence of a period of a slight luminosity increase between the early fading phase and the lc drop .",
    "the bolometric luminosity increase is found in three of our canonical models .",
    "the luminosity increase is also found in the @xmath29-band lcs , although the increase in the @xmath29-band lc with @xmath35 is less significant and it is almost flat .",
    "the remaining lc with @xmath36 does not show the luminosity increase , but the lc flattens before the drop .",
    "we call the increasing part of the lcs we found in our lc models as a `` bump '' in the following .",
    "we clearly see the lc bump in the models with @xmath37 and 2.0  @xmath0 , while it is vague in the model with @xmath36 . the model with @xmath35",
    "shows the bump in a short timescale .",
    "thus , we are likely to observe the lc bump for a long time in the canonical explosions of the progenitors with @xmath38 .",
    "this kind of bumps are also found in other numerical lc models of rapidly fading sne  ii ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but they are not paid attention much . the origin of the bump is discussed in the next section where lc models with different @xmath2  masses and explosion energies are presented . in this study , we focus on this bump and try to use it to deduce the nature of rapidly fading sne  ii .",
    "another lc feature to note is in our lc model of the smallest @xmath9  ( @xmath39 ) . because the recombination wave recedes in the hydrogen - rich envelope very quickly due to the small @xmath9 , the early lc declines in a very short timescale",
    "then , after the lc drop following the bump discussed above , the luminosity increases again instead of following the @xmath40  nuclear decay rate .",
    "the peak time of this part of the lc ( @xmath41 60 days ) corresponds to the diffusion time in the core , and thus the luminosity increase is likely due to the diffusion in the core .",
    "the hydrogen - rich envelope mass in the model is close to those in sne  iib and the lc starts to be similar to those of sne  iib with @xmath35 .",
    "the bolometric lc shape is also somewhat similar to that of sn  1987a , although our lc evolves in shorter timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of sne  ii may exist as an intermediate type between sne  iil and sne  iib .     with different explosion energies and @xmath2  masses .",
    "the reference lc is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : standard ] . ]    . ]      to investigate the cause of the lc bump found in our rapidly fading sn  ii models , we explore lcs with different explosion energies and @xmath2  masses in this section . for this purpose , we use the 14.0 @xmath0  progenitor model with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we choose this model for our further investigation because ( i ) the lc from the canonical explosion parameters has a significant bump , ( ii ) the progenitor has almost the same mass as our reference model ( 14 @xmath0 ) , and ( iii ) the progenitor is obtained without modifying the mass - loss rates @xmath44 .",
    "general bump properties found for this progenitor model with different explosion energies and @xmath2  masses are also found in other progenitors .",
    "we use three different explosion energies ( 1 , 2 , and 3 b ) and @xmath2  masses ( 0.01 , 0.05 , and 0.1 @xmath0 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffeni ] shows the lcs with different explosion energies and @xmath2  masses .",
    "first of all , we find that the bump is strongly affected by the @xmath2  mass . when the @xmath2  mass is increased to 0.1 @xmath0 , the duration of the bump becomes twice as long as that of the model with @xmath45 .",
    "when the @xmath2  mass is decreased to 0.01 @xmath0 , the lc bump almost disappears and there only remains a brief almost plateau phase after the early declining phase . in the case of sne",
    "iip , the amount of @xmath2  affects the duration of the plateau phase , but we do not expect the formation of the bump in this @xmath2  mass range @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a lc model with @xmath46 , but they did not include @xmath2 .",
    "this may be why they did not find the bump in their lc .",
    "the fact that the lc bump is strongly affected by the @xmath2  mass indicates that the lc bump is caused by the heating from the nuclear decay of @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : photomass ] , we show the location of the photosphere in the models presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffeni ] .",
    "photosphere is defined as the location where the rosseland mean optical depth becomes @xmath48 .",
    "the photosphere recedes inward similarly at first in the models with different @xmath2  masses .",
    "then , when the photosphere reaches near the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope , the photosphere stays there for a while because the heating due to the nuclear decay can keep hydrogen ionized . because the radius of the photosphere increases with time if it stays in the same mass coordinate , the luminosity increases during this epoch .",
    "thus , the bump appears in the lcs .",
    "the photosphere eventually goes into the core when hydrogen in the envelope can no longer be kept ionized , and the lcs drop at that moment . because larger amount of @xmath2  can keep hydrogen ionized longer , the bump appears more significantly with larger amount of @xmath2 .",
    "next , we investigate the effect of explosion energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffeni ] shows lcs with different explosion energies .",
    "the evolution of the location of the photosphere is in fig .",
    "[ fig : photomass ] . the early luminosity becomes larger as the explosion energy increases .",
    "meanwhile , the bump is significantly reduced or almost disappears when the explosion energy is above 2 b when @xmath45 .",
    "this is because more rapid expansion results in more rapid reduction of the gamma - ray optical depth , and the heating from the nuclear decay is less effective .",
    "in addition , the adiabatic cooling in the sn ejecta becomes more effective with higher explosion energy . as a result",
    ", the photosphere no longer stays at the bottom of the hydrogen - rich layers for a long time .",
    "the lc models in @xcite do not have significant bumps presumably because they mostly present lcs for an explosion energy of 2  b.    to summarize , we find that large explosion energies ( @xmath49  b ) and small @xmath2  masses ( @xmath50 ) make the lc bumps less significant .    mixing .",
    "the effect of the mixing is explored with the explosions of the @xmath34 progenitor with the canonical explosion energy ( 1  b ) and two different @xmath2  masses ( 0.05 @xmath0  and 0.1 @xmath0 ) .",

    "we find that the heating from the nuclear decay of @xmath2  strongly affects the lc bump in the previous section .",
    "since the heating from the nuclear decay depends on the degree of the @xmath2  mixing , we investigate the effect of the @xmath2  mixing on the lc bumps .",
    "we assume two kinds of @xmath2  mixing in our lc calculations .",
    "@xmath2  is mixed only in the core in one case and in the entire sn ejecta in the other .",
    "is uniformly mixed in both cases .",
    "figure  [ fig : mixing ] shows how the lc bump is affected by the @xmath2  mixing",
    ". the higher degree of mixing makes the lc bump less significant .",
    "this is because the photosphere recedes more slowly with the @xmath2  mixing thanks to the more efficient heating by the nuclear decay in the outer hydrogen - rich layers .",
    "the slower recession of the photosphere can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : photomix ] where the evolution of photosphere in mass coordinate is shown .    another interesting consequence of the @xmath2  mixing appears in the late - time lc tails after the luminosity drop . all the late - time lcs decline with the timescale of the @xmath40  decay .",
    "meanwhile , the luminosity of the tails depends on the degree of the @xmath2  mixing .",
    "this is simply because gamma - rays from the nuclear decay are less likely to be absorbed by the ejecta if they are emitted in outer layers .",
    "recently , @xcite argued that the lc tails of type iib / ib / ic sne have much diversity even if their early lcs have similar properties .",
    "they ascribed the diversity on the explosion asymmetry .",

    "has helium mass of 6.4  @xmath0  and hydrogen mass of 3.1  @xmath0  in total in hydrogen - rich and helium layers . based on this progenitor model , we construct a progenitor model in which the hydrogen - rich and helium layers are fully mixed .",

    "the lc from the mixed progenitor is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hemixing ] .",

    "thus , the helium mixing does not result in the reduction nor disappearance of the lc bump .",

    "we have confirmed that sne  ii from progenitors with low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes fade quickly , and their decline rates are consistent with those observed in rapidly fading sne  ii .",
    "however , our lc models with the canonical explosion energy ( @xmath55  = 1  b ) and @xmath2  mass ( @xmath56  = 0.05  @xmath0 ) often show a temporal luminosity increase ( lc bump ) before all the hydrogen in the hydrogen - rich envelope recombines . this kind of lc bumps have not been observed in rapidly fading sne  ii .",
    "this implies that rapidly fading sne  ii may not only be characterized by low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes .",
    "some explosion properties which prevent lcs from having the lc bump may be commonly shared among rapidly fading sne  ii .    we have found four possible ways to make the lc bump less significant , i.e. , large explosion energies ( @xmath49  b ) , small @xmath2  masses ( @xmath57  @xmath0 ) , large degrees of @xmath2  mixing , and large progenitor radii . if sn  ii progenitors with low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes tend to come from relatively more massive stars among sn  ii progenitors , they are likely to have larger explosion energy , according to the empirical relation between explosion energy and progenitor mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , the lack of the lc bump may indicate that most rapidly fading sne  ii have low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes because of higher zams masses , which end up with both low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes and high explosion energies .",
    "sn  ii progenitors with low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes can also originate from small zams mass stars if they are in binary systems thanks to the mass loss by binary interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , small zams mass sn  iil progenitors are disfavored if sne  iil typically have larger explosion energies than sne  iip , contrary to sne  iib which may prefer small zams mass progenitors in binary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are other observational indications that sne  iil may prefer higher zams mass progenitors than sne  iip ( e.g. , @xcite , see @xcite for the case of sn  2009kr ) .    a small amount of @xmath2  in the ejecta is also shown to reduce the lc bump .",
    "however , sn  ii observations indicate that rapidly fading sne  ii tend to have slightly higher @xmath2  masses than slowly fading ones @xcite .",
    "thus , observations disfavor this way of making the lc bump less significant , although several possible mechanisms can make @xmath2  masses of sne  ii small .",
    "for example , some high mass progenitors may suffer significantly from fallback , resulting in small amount of @xmath2  ejection .",
    "the lc bump is also shown to be reduced by large degrees of the @xmath2  mixing .",
    "some sne  ii are suggested to experience significant mixing in the sn ejecta ( e.g. , sn  1987a , @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of the lc bump in observed sne  ii may thus indicate that sne  ii generally have large degrees of internal mixing , dredging up @xmath2  above the stellar core .",
    "it has been suggested that the rapidly fading sne  ii may result from the larger degree of helium mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have confirmed that the helium mixing does make the lc decline rate of sne  ii larger .",
    "however , the helium mixing does not result in the reduction of the lc bump .",
    "the fact that we do not observe the lc bump indicates that the helium mixing is not the only reason we observe rapidly fading sne  ii . even if the helium mixing plays a role in having a large decline rate ,",
    "other mechanisms like the @xmath2  mixing should be accompanied to reduce the lc bump .",
    "finally , radii of sn  ii progenitors may be significantly expanded , as we discussed in section  [ sec : radii ] .",
    "the expansion of the progenitor radii can result in large luminosity , which makes the lc bump less significant , and reduction of the hydrogen - rich envelope density ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which makes the lc decline more rapid .",
    "in addition , the radius expansion of sne  ii progenitors with large @xmath9may also result in rapidly fading sne  ii with sn  iip features like asassn-13co @xcite because of the small envelope density with a large hydrogen - rich envelope mass .",
    "the observed rise times of sne  ii are suggested to indicate smaller progenitor radii for more rapidly fading sne  ii , but the difference may not be significant @xcite .",
    "the shock breakout observations as is recently reported by @xcite will further help to constrain the progenitor radii .    to summarize , the lc bumps we find in our lc models for the progenitors with low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes which is not observed in sn  iil lcs indicates that rapidly fading sne  ii are not only characterized by a low - mass hydrogen - rich envelope , which is responsible for the rapid lc decline , but also by explosion properties , large degrees of @xmath2  mixing , and/or large progenitor radii .",
    "the later two properties , the large @xmath2  mixing and large progenitor radii may also be a general characteristic of sne  ii including sne  iip , but their consequences may simply be easier to recognize in rapidly fading sne  ii .",
    "we have presented our results of lc modeling of sne  ii from progenitors with hydrogen - rich envelope masses near the solar mass . we have confirmed that this kind of sn progenitors result in rapidly fading sne  ii ( sne  iil ) .",
    "however , we find that theoretical lcs from such sn progenitors show a temporal luminosity increase ( lc bump ) shortly before all the hydrogen in the envelope recombines when they have the canonical explosion energy of 1  b and @xmath2  mass of 0.05 @xmath0 .",
    "the temporal luminosity increase is due to the heating from the @xmath2decay , which keeps hydrogen ionized and make the photosphere stay at the innermost layers of the hydrogen - rich envelope for a while . because this kind of temporal luminosity increase has not been observed , rapidly fading sne  ii are likely to have more properties in common than a low - mass hydrogen - rich envelope , making the lc bump less significant .",
    "we show four possible ways to make the lc bump less significant , i.e. ,    1 .",
    "large explosion energies ( @xmath58 b ) 2 .",
    "small @xmath2  masses ( @xmath50 ) 3 .",
    "large degrees of @xmath2  mixing 4 .   extended progenitor radii .",
    "we also find that the helium mixing into the hydrogen - rich layer does not help reducing the lc bump , although it can make lc decline rates large .    because rapidly fading sne  ii are observationally found to have larger @xmath2  masses than slowly fading sne  ii @xcite , the lack of the lc bump in observed sn  iil lcs indicates that the other three properties are likely to be shared among sne  iil , in addition to the low - mass hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "if sn  iil progenitors tend to have larger explosion energies than those of sne  iip , the empirical relation between the progenitor mass and the explosion energy implies that sn  iil progenitors are more massive than sn  iip progenitors .",
    "then , most of sn  iil progenitors may not originate from small zams mass progenitors which can lose their hydrogen - rich envelope by binary interactions .",
    "alternatively , sne  iil may have larger degrees of @xmath2  mixing or more extended progenitor radii than expected .",
    "another possible way to interpret the lack of the lc bump in sne  iil is that not only sne  iil but sne  ii including sne  iip may generally have large degrees of @xmath2  mixing and/or extended progenitor radii .",
    "the effect of large @xmath2  mixing and an extended progenitor radius may be easier to recognize in sn progenitors with low - mass hydrogen - rich envelopes through the lc bump as we find in this study . constraining the degree of the @xmath2  mixing and the expansion of the progenitor radius in sne  iil as well as sne  iip will be helpful to further constrain the intrinsic properties of sne  iil .",
