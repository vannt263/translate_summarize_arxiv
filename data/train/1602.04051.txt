    "different physical mechanisms , which are at work in the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres , e.g. , the solar wind expansion , compression of the magnetic field , may lead to large deviations from isotropy of the velocity distributions of plasma particles .",
    "indeed , the in - situ measurements reveal the anisotropy of electrons and protons , which , for instance , exhibit different temperature components @xmath1 relative to the local magnetic field @xmath2 @xcite . however , these deviations from isotropy are not large , and in the absence of collisions only the resulting instabilities may scatter particles back towards a quasi - equilibrium state and prevent the anisotropy to grow indefinitely @xcite . thus , in collisionless plasmas linear dispersion theory predicts that protons ( ions ) with an excess of perpendicular temperature @xmath3 may drive the electromagnetic ion cyclotron ( emic ) instability @xcite . according to @xcite , this instability has a maximum growth rate at parallel propagation @xmath4 , where the emic modes are left - hand ( lh ) circularly polarized .    in competition with mirror instability that develops for the same conditions , the emic modes grow faster @xcite , but the mirror thresholds shape better the limits of the proton anisotropy observed in the solar wind at 1 au @xcite . one possible explanation for this disagreement may reside in the fact that the emic fluctuations also dissipates faster due to resonant cyclotron interactions with protons @xcite .",
    "otherwise , this disagreement may be a result of the limitations in the approach , which ignores either the interplay of protons with other species ( e.g. , alpha particles , electrons ) or the presence of suprathermal ( kappa - like ) populations .",
    "the presence of alpha particles changes the dispersive properties of the plasma and introduces the alpha cyclotron instability @xcite . for certain conditions ,",
    "e.g. , protons and alpha particles with the same temperatures and temperature anisotropies , numerical simulations predict emic thresholds with a better alignment to the limits of proton anisotropy in the fast winds but not in the slow winds @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the instability conditions are found to be markedly influenced by the electrons with anisotropic temperatures , and their effect is enhanced by the electron - proton temperature ratio .",
    "however , the instability thresholds obtained in this case do not indicate better constrains for the proton anisotropy in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the electrons have an impact on proton instability by changing the wave phase velocity , which may increase the number of resonant protons and , implicitly , enhance the growth rate of the instability @xcite .",
    "mutual effects of electrons and ions have already been studied for conditions favorable to the firehose instability @xcite or the emic instability @xcite , but the influence of suprathermal populations was neglected in these cases . in the present paper we demonstrate the existence of new regimes of this instability triggered by the suprathermal electrons , which are ubiquitous in space plasmas . enhanced by these suprathermal populations , the high energy tails of the electron velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) measured in the solar wind ( at various heliographic coordinates )",
    "are well described by the kappa distribution functions @xcite , which are nearly maxwellian at low energies and decrease as power - laws at high energies . in the last decades , this realistic model has proved to be a veritable tool of modelling particle velocity distributions , replacing or complementing the standard maxwellian distribution function when describing space pasma systems out of thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the emic instability conditions are therefore expected to be markedly altered by the deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium shown by the electron distributions in the solar wind , which may cumulate the effects of suprathermal populations and the anisotropic temperatures @xcite . to include these effects in the analysis",

    "we focus on the emic instability in the conditions relevant for the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are presented in the last section .",

    "the emic thresholds obtained in this case are increased by the electron anisotropy .",
    "this effect is enhanced by the temperature contrast between electrons and protons and by the suprathermal electrons , especially for higher values of the proton plasma beta , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "comparison with the observations do not indicate a better alignment of the emic thresholds to the limits of the proton anisotropy in the solar wind .",
    "however , under the influence of suprathermal electrons , the emic thresholds show a tendency to exceed the observational limits of the proton anisotropy , especially for higher values of the plasma beta @xmath108 , where the potential of this instability to constrain the proton anisotropy is significantly increased .    in the opposite case ,",
    "the anisotropic electrons with @xmath90 stimulate the emic instability , and this effect is enhanced in the presence of suprathermal electrons ( i.e. , by decreasing the @xmath19-index ) .",
    "however , a major enhancing effect is more apparent in this case for the efh instability that gives rise to a second peak of the growth rates at higher wave - numbers .",
    "thus , the efh peak may in general exceed the emic peak , which becomes indistinguishable for certain conditions . however , the emic growth rates are always enhanced by the suprathermal electrons with @xmath103 , leading to the conclusion that the emic thresholds are diminished in this case , and are even less relevant for the anisotropy limits of solar wind protons .",
    "we must add that all these effects are revealed only by a kappa approach which assumes the effective temperature of electrons increasing with the increase of suprathermal electrons . otherwise , for a kappa model with the effective temperature independent of @xmath59 , the emic instability is not affected by these populations .",
    "our results in the present paper complement those of a recent series of investigations on the proton anisotropy instabilities , namely , the parallel firehose @xcite , and the emic instability @xcite .",
    "these studies are based on advanced and less - idealized kinetic approaches , which enable us to decode the interplay of thermal ( core ) protons with thermal and suprathermal electrons , and implicitly their destabilizing effects on different plasma modes .",
    "thus , the parallel firehose instability is found to be markedly affected by the presence of anisotropic electrons , such that the instability thresholds predicted under some circumstances may describe the observations without considering the oblique firehose mode @xcite . the same anisotropic electrons can also change the emic thresholds but whithout a satisfactory reshaping that could explain the observations @xcite . in conclusion , we now can add that suprathermal electrons have an important influence on the emic instability , and this influence is highly conditioned by two principal factors : the temperature anisotropy of electrons which may stimulate or inhibit the emic fluctuations , and the electron / proton temperature ratio which enhances the effects of the anisotropic electrons .",
    "moreover , the emic instability thresholds undergo major changes in the presence of anisotropic electrons with @xmath90 and an important suprathermal component ( i.e. , for lower values of @xmath59 ) , but the new thresholds do not show better alignment to the limits of the proton anisotropy @xmath109 measured at 1 au in the solar wind .",
    "apparently negative , these results are however important , as they provide us with enlightening answers , namely , that neither the mutual electron - proton effects analyzed by @xcite , nor the presence of suprathermal electrons studied in the presence paper can influence the emic thresholds to explain the limit of proton anisotropy in the solar wind .",
