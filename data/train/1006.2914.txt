    "the simultaneous flow of immiscible fluids in porous media occurs in a wide variety of applications .",
    "the most concentrated research in the field of multiphase flows over the past four decades has focused on unsaturated groundwater flows , and flows in underground petroleum reservoirs .",
    "most recently , multiphase flows have generated serious interest among engineers concerned with deep geological repository for radioactive waste .",
    "there is growing awareness that the effect of hydrogen gas generation , due to anaerobic corrosion of the steel engineered barriers of radioactive waste packages(carbon steel overpacks and stainless steel envelopes ) , can affect all the functions allocated to the canisters or to the buffers and the backfill .",
    "the host rock safety function may even be threaten by overpressurisation leading to opening fractures in the host rock and inducing groundwater flow and transport of radionuclides outside of the waste site boundaries .",
    "equations governing this type of flow in porous media are inherently nonlinear , and the geometries and material properties characterizing many situations in many applications ( petroleum reservoir , gas storage , waste repository ) , can be quite irregular and contrasted . as a result of all these difficulties ,",
    "numerical simulation often offers the only viable approach to modelling multiphase porous - media flows . in nuclear waste management ,",
    "the migration of gas through the near field environment and the host rock , involves two components , water and pure hydrogen @xmath0 ; and two phases `` liquid '' and `` gas '' . our ability to understand and predict underground gas migration is crucial to the design and to assessing the performance of reliable nuclear waste storages",
    "this is a fairly new frontier in multiphase porous - media flows , and again the inherent complexity of the physics leads to governing equations for which the only practical way to produce solutions may be numerical simulation .",
    "this paper addresses one of the outstanding physical and mathematical problems in multiphase flow simulation : the appearance and disappearance of one of the phases , leading to the degeneracy of the equations satisfied by the saturation . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we discuss a formulation based on variables which does nt degenerate and hence could be used as an unique formulation for both situations , liquid saturated and unsaturated .",
    "we will demonstrate through four numerical tests , the ability of this new formulation to actually cope with the appearance or / and disappearance of one phase in simple , typical but challenging situations , like the ones we met in underground radioactive waste repository simulations .",
    "we consider herein a porous medium saturated with a fluid composed of 2 phases , _ liquid _ and _ gas _ , and two components . according to the application we have in mind",
    ", we consider the fluid as a mixture of two components : water ( only liquid ) and hydrogen ( @xmath0 , mostly gas ) or any gas with similar thermodynamical properties . in the following , for sake of simplicity we will call _ hydrogen _ the non - water component and use indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the _ water _ and the _ hydrogen _ components .",
    "we neglect the water vaporization since , in underground formations with high water pressure , the water vapor does not contribute significantly to the gas phase pressure .",
    "the water component is incompressible while the gas phase follow the ideal gas law .",
    "the whole fluid system is in thermal equilibrium and the porous medium is rigid , meaning that the porosity @xmath3 is only a function of the space variable @xmath4 ; moreover , since hydrogen is highly diffusive we include the dissolved hydrogen diffusion in the liquid phase .",
    "the two phases are denoted by indices , @xmath5 for liquid , and @xmath6 for gas .",
    "associated to each phase @xmath7 , we have , in the porous medium , the phase pressures @xmath8 , the phase saturations @xmath9 , the phase mass densities @xmath10 and the phase volumetric flow rates @xmath11 .",
    "the phase volumetric flow rates are given by the _ darcy - muskat law _",
    ": @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the absolute permeability tensor , @xmath14 is the @xmath15phase relative mobility function , and @xmath16 is the gravity acceleration ; @xmath9 is the reduced @xmath15phase saturation and then satisfies : @xmath17 pressures are connected through a given _ capillary pressure law _ : @xmath18 from definition ( [ capillary ] ) we notice that @xmath19 is a strictly increasing function of gas saturation , @xmath20 , leading to a _",
    "capillary constraint _ : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the capillary curve entry pressure ( see figure [ p - c ] ) .",
    "since the liquid phase could be composed of water and dissolved hydrogen , we need to introduce the water mass concentration @xmath23 in the liquid phase , and the hydrogen mass concentration @xmath24 in the liquid phase .",
    "note that the upper index is the component index , and the lower one denotes the phase .",
    "we have , then @xmath25 as said before , in the gas phase , we neglect the water vaporization and we use the ideal gas law : @xmath26 with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the temperature , @xmath29 the universal gas constant and @xmath30 the hydrogen molar mass .",
    "mass conservation for each component leads to the following differential equations : @xmath31 where the phase flow velocities , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are given by the darcy - muskat law ( [ darcy ] ) , @xmath34 are the source terms , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the @xmath37component diffusive flux in liquid phase , as defined later in ( [ diff - fluxes ] ) .    assuming water incompressibility and that the liquid volume is independent of the dissolved hydrogen concentration , we may assume the water component concentration in the liquid phase to be constant , i.e. : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the standard water density .",
    "the assumption of hydrogen thermodynamical equilibrium in both phases leads to equal chemical potentials in each phase : @xmath40 . assuming that in the gas phase there is only the hydrogen component and no water , leads to @xmath41 ; and then , from the above chemical potentials equality , we have a relationship @xmath42 . assuming that the liquid pressure influence could be neglected in the pressure range considered herein and using the hydrogen low solubility , @xmath43 ,",
    "we may then linearize the relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and finally obtain the _ henry s law _",
    "@xmath46 , where @xmath47 is specific to the mixture water / hydrogen and depends only on the temperature @xmath28 . furthermore , using ( [ const - w ] ) and the hydrogen low solubility",
    ", the molar fraction , @xmath45 , reduces to @xmath48 ( see eqs.(9)-(11 ) in @xcite )  and the _ henry law _ can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 ; @xmath51 is called the henry law constant and is also depending only on the temperature .     and",
    "unsaturated @xmath52 states , height=153 ]    [ rem:1 ] on the one hand the gas pressure obey the capillary pressure law ( [ capillary ] ) with the constraint ( [ capillaryconstraint ] ) , but on the other hand it should also satisfy the local thermodynamical equilibrium and obey the henry law ( [ henry ] ) .",
    "more precisely if there are two phases , i.e. if the concentration , @xmath24 , is sufficiently high to have a gas phase appearance(@xmath52 ) , we have from ( [ henry ] ) and ( [ capillary ] ) : @xmath53 moreover , @xmath52 with the constraint ( [ capillaryconstraint ] ) and the henry s law ( [ henry ] ) , gives the constraint : @xmath54 but if the concentration , @xmath24 , is smaller than a certain concentration threshold ( see figure [ p - d ] ) , then there is only the liquid phase ( no gas phase , @xmath55 ) , and none of all the relationships ( [ capillary ] ) or ( [ seuil ] ) , connected to capillary equilibrium , applies anymore ; we have only @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "+ there is then a concentration threshold line , corresponding to @xmath57 in the phase diagram ( fig.[p - d ] ) , separating the one phase ( liquid saturated ) region from the two phase ( liquid unsaturated ) region .",
    "[ rem_nonequ ]    the existence of a concentration threshold line can also be written as an unilateral condition : @xmath58 which could be then used ( see @xcite ) for designing a numerical scheme based on approximating a variational equation . @xmath59 + the diffusive fluxes in the liquid phase are given by the fick law applied to @xmath60 and to @xmath45 , the water component and the hydrogen component molar fractions ( see eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "using the same kind of approximation as in the henry law , based on the hydrogen low solubility , we obtain , for the diffusive fluxes in this binary mixture ( see remark 2 and remark 3 in @xcite ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the hydrogen molecular diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase , corrected by the tortuosity of the porous medium .",
    "if both liquid and gas phases exist , ( @xmath63 ) ,  the porous media is said _ liquid unsaturated _ and the transport model for the liquid - gas system can be now written as : @xmath64 but in the _ liquid saturated _ regions , where the gas phase does nt appear , @xmath65 or @xmath66 , the system ( [ conssl])([eq:5 ] ) degenerates to : @xmath67",
    "a typical choice for the two primary unknowns , in modeling immiscible two - phase flow , is the saturation and one of the phases pressure , for example @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "but as seen above , in ( [ conssl])([un : eq:34 ] ) , this set of unknowns obviously can not describe the flow in a liquid saturated region , where there is only one phase , and can not take in account the gas dissolution since then the dissolved gas concentration , @xmath24 , becomes an independent unknown .      to solve this problem , instead of using the gas saturation @xmath68",
    "we have proposed , in @xcite , to use @xmath70 , the total hydrogen mass concentration , defined as : @xmath71 defining @xmath72 ;      \\label{a : def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 since @xmath74 , from the assumption of weak solubility ; we may then rewrite the total hydrogen mass concentration ,  @xmath75 , defined in ( [ def - rho ] ) , as :    @xmath76    with this new set of unknowns , @xmath70 and @xmath69 , the two systems of equations ( [ conssl])([eq:5 ] ) and ( [ un : eq:12])([un : eq:34 ] ) now reduce to a single system of equations : @xmath77 now , if we want to study the mathematical properties of the operators in this system of equations , we should develop the above system of equations using @xmath78 ,   @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , with @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath83 .",
    "as noted in section 2.5 in @xcite , we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 , when the gas phase is present",

    "b_2(p_l,\\rho_{tot}^{h } ) = & -(\\lambda_l(s_g )   \\rho_l^h [ \\rho_{w}^{std } +   \\rho_{l}^{h } ]                   + \\lambda_g(s_g)c_v^2   p_g^2 ) ;   \\label{coef : in:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath88 denoting the identity matrix and with the auxiliary functions @xmath89    we should notice first that equation ( [ eq:2 - 3 ] ) is uniformly parabolic in the presence of capillarity and diffusion ; but if capillarity and diffusion are neglected , this same equation becomes a pure hyperbolic transport equation ( see sec .",
    "2.6 in @xcite ) . then",
    ", if we sum equations ( [ eq:1 - 3 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 - 3 ] ) we obtain a uniformly parabolic / elliptic equation , which is parabolic in the unsaturated ( two - phases ) region and elliptic in the liquid saturated ( one - phase ) region .",
    "simulations presented in sec .",
    "3.2 in @xcite show that this last model with these variables , @xmath70 , the total hydrogen mass concentration , and @xmath69 , the liquid phase pressure , could easily handle phase transitions ( appearance and disappearance of the gas phase ) in two - phase partially miscible flows .",
    "however , in equations ( [ eq:1 - 3])([eq:2 - 3 ] ) , we should notice that both the coefficients @xmath90 in operators , and the time derivative coefficients , can be discontinuous .",
    "for instance , only if the capillary pressure satisfies @xmath91 , as in the van genuchten model , then all the coefficients in ( [ eq:1 - 3])([eq:2 - 3 ] ) are continuous ; but if this condition is not satisfied they will be discontinuous .    an other variant for the replacement of the saturation by @xmath92 , is presented in @xcite , where relation ( [ def - rho])is written @xmath93 and is then extended to both the two - phase and the one - phase region by making @xmath94 in the liquid saturated region ( without the gas phase ) .",
    "this is leading , in the one - phase region where @xmath55 and the henry law does not apply , to extend the gas saturation by negative values ( still defined by equation ( [ panf:1 ] ) as a function of the pressure and the total hydrogen concentration ) .",
    "after a necessary and ad hoc extension of the permeability and capillary pressure curves , out of the usual positive values of saturation , it is then possible to modeling both the one - phase flow and the two - phase flow with the same system of equations written with this extended saturation as main unknown , while using actually the total hydrogen concentration @xmath70 .",
    "we have seen that the variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 , introduced in the last section , can describe simply the flow system , both in the one - phase and in the two - phase regions , independently of the presence of diffusion or capillary forces .",
    "but if we assume that the capillary forces are present we can choose an other change of variables in order to have a system of equations with continuous coefficients .",
    "namely , using the inverse of the capillary pressure function , we may define the phase saturation as function of the hydrogen mass concentration in the liquid , @xmath24 , and of the liquid pressure , @xmath69 ; and hence use them as main unknowns .",
    "with these two variables , @xmath24 and @xmath69 the two systems ( [ conssl])([eq:5 ] ) and ( [ un : eq:12])([un : eq:34 ] ) are transformed in a single system of equations able to describe both liquid saturated and unsaturated flow .    , and inverse function , height=153 ]    since the capillary pressure curve @xmath95 is a strictly increasing function we can define an inverse function @xmath96 $ ] , ( see fig .",
    "[ p - c ] ) , by @xmath97 by definition of the function @xmath98 , using ( [ henry ] ) and ( [ seuil ] ) , we have : @xmath99 and it is then possible to compute the gas saturations , @xmath68 , from @xmath69 and @xmath100 .",
    "these two variables being well defined in both the one and two - phase regimes , we will now use them as principal unknowns .",
    "equations  - with unknowns @xmath69 and @xmath24 can be written as : @xmath101 where the coefficients are given by the following formulas : @xmath102 with @xmath103 if we consider first , equation  , we may write it as @xmath104 moreover , from and because @xmath105 and @xmath106 are positive , we have @xmath107    and if the diffusion is not neglected , we have definite positiveness of the quadratic form @xmath108 , in equation  ; i.e. for any @xmath109 , latexmath:[\\ [ ( { \\mathbb{a}}^{2,2}\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\xi } ) = \\lambda_g(s_g)\\frac{c_v}{c_h^{2}}\\rho_l^h { \\mathbb{k}}\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\xi } + { \\phi ( 1-s_g ) } d    parabolic in @xmath24 .",
    "+ if we develop , equation   as follows : @xmath111 we have , for any @xmath112 , @xmath113 and then positiveness of @xmath114 and of @xmath115 .",
    "moreover , @xmath116    however , equations in system - are not uniformly parabolic / elliptic for the pressure @xmath69 , because the coefficients , @xmath117 , in front of @xmath118 in ",
    "tend to zero as @xmath119 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this system - , with variables @xmath69 and @xmath100 , has interesting properties for numerical simulations in strongly heterogeneous porous media .",
    "these two variables are continuous through interfaces separating different porous media with different rock types ( different absolute permeability , different capillary and permeability curves ) , as we will see in [ sec : 4.3 ] ; which is absolutely not the case for the variables @xmath69 and @xmath120 . an other advantage is the continuity of all the coefficients @xmath121 , in  and the continuity of @xmath105 in , even if @xmath122 .",
    "in this last section , we present four numerical tests specially designed for illustrating the ability of the model described by equations ( [ eq : ii : sys_p - r_1])-([eq : ii : sys_p - r_2 ] ) to deal with gas phase appearance and disappearance .",
    "although all the computations were done using the variables , @xmath69 and @xmath24 , we are also displaying , for each test , the saturation and pressure level curves .",
    "these two last quantities are obtained after a post processing step using the capillary pressure law ( [ capillary ] ) , equations ( [ eq : ii : sg = f ] ) , henry s law ( [ henry ] ) , and following the constraints ( [ capillaryconstraint ] ) and ( [ seuil ] ) ( see figure [ p - d ] ) .",
    "+ the first test focuses on the gas phase appearance produced by injecting pure hydrogen in a 2-d homogeneous porous domain @xmath123 ( see figure  [ fig : geom2d ] ) , which is initially liquid saturated by pure water(water saturated ) .    because the main goal of all these numerical experiments is to test the model efficiency , for describing the phase appearance or disappearance ,",
    "the porous domain geometry does not really matter and we will use a porous domain with a simple geometry . consequently , we choose a simple , quasi-1d , porous domain ( see figure  [ fig : geom1d ] ) for the all three next tests .",
    "the test case number 2 is more complex , it shows local disappearance of the gas phase created by injecting pure hydrogen in a homogeneous unsaturated porous medium ( initially both phases , liquid and gas , are present everywhere ) .",
    "the two last tests aim is to focus on the main challenges in simulating the flow crossing the engineered barriers , located around the waste packages . in the test case number 3 ,",
    "the porous medium domain is split in two parts with different and highly contrasted rock types , and like in the first one , the gas phase appearance is produced by injecting pure hydrogen in an initially water saturated porous domain .",

    "the liquid pressure , the hydrogen density and the gas saturation profiles are all strictly monotonous and continuous , going towards a spatially uniform distribution , corresponding to the stationary state(see figure  [ fig : ct4_2 ] ) .    as expected , the system initially out of equilibrium ( discontinuity of the gas pressure ) , becomes immediately again in equilibrium ( the gas pressure is continuous)and evolves towards a uniform stationary state ( due to the no mass inflow and outflow boundary conditions ) .",

    "the diffusion is supposed to reduce the hydrogen concentration contrast , by creating a flux going from strong concentrations ( in the unsaturated zone ) towards the low concentrations ( in the liquid saturated zone ) , and on the other hand the flow of the liquid phase goes in the opposite direction ( left to right , from @xmath55 to @xmath52 ) .",
