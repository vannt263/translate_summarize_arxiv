    "the group of very rare dwarf galaxies with gas metallicities z below z@xmath2/10 ( or 12+@xmath1(o / h)@xmath07.65 , e.g. , review by @xcite ) , are called extremely metal - deficient , or xmd galaxies .",
    "such objects comprise only about two per cent of known blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) , low - mass galaxies with active star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the latter , in turn , comprise about 6 per cent of the entire local dwarf galaxy population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thanks to intensive searches for new xmd galaxies in several recent large surveys , , the number of currently known such objects in the local universe is about 100 .",
    "there is also progress in identification of such objects at large redshifts @xcite .",
    "the interest in these _ atypical _ , local universe galaxies is caused by the similarity of their properties to low - mass galaxies in the early universe , when the typical metallicity of galaxies was one - two orders of magnitude smaller than the solar one .",
    "therefore , understanding the specific processes of star formation ( sf ) and evolution in nearby galaxies with such low metallicity will provide insights into similar processes in young galaxies at high redshifts . to better understand various aspects of xmd galaxies star formation and evolution , we conduct an extensive study of a subsample of xmd galaxies in optical , nir and radio domains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one of the fundamental questions of sf in low - mass , gas - rich galaxies is the trigger mechanisms of starbursts : whether the intrinsic instabilities in gas discs are capable to produce the observed level of enhanced ( bursting ) sf ( e.g. , models by @xcite and @xcite ; observations of virgo cluster dirs by @xcite and references therein ) , or external mechanisms ( such as tidal disturbances and mergers ) are necessary in a significant fraction of observed starbursts .    from the analysis of the density distribution in bcgs in comparison to more typical late - type dwarfs , @xcite concluded that the former have a higher gas concentration and , therefore , bcgs represent a special group of galaxies , more susceptible to internal instabilities and related starbursts .",
    "but , it is unknown whether this is an inherent property of bcg progenitors , or this higher gas concentration appeared due to a minor merger , or as a result of a recent interaction with a barely detectable companion .",
    "if due to mergers or interactions , bcg progenitors could be the quite common late - type dwarfs . to disentangle the possible scenarios one needs a large , representative sample of starbursting galaxies with well studied and understood kinematics of both hi and ionized gas",
    "this is required to determine the prevalence of external or internal disturbances .",
    "first statistical indications for the possible importance of interactions to trigger starbursts in bcg progenitors was presented by @xcite in their search for hi - rich companions in a small bcg sample . for a larger bcg sample , the conclusion on the high fraction of interaction - induced starbursts was made by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , based on the comparison of observed relative distances and ` threshold tidal distances ' , at which a perturber galaxy should induce shocks in the gas disc and produce dissipation of gas angular momentum ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "while that study was _ indicative _ of the important role of collisions in _ starbursts _ of gas - rich low - mass galaxies , more elaborate tests should be used to clear up the real role of external factors in starbursts . in turn",
    ", numerous studies of galaxy morphology and kinematics at redshifts of up to @xmath31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show clear indications on the importance of external mechanisms on the enhanced sf in a significantly larger galaxy fraction than at the current epoch .    in many cases ,",
    "the traces of interactions can be hidden if only images of stellar components are available .",
    "therefore , gas morphology and kinematics provide a better tracer of interaction - induced starbursts . to this end , hi mapping is a good way for galaxies with sufficiently large hi flux . for less gas - rich and/or more distant galaxies , the study of the ionized gas kinematics can be a good , complementary technique .",
    "besides , this method provides usually a finer angular resolution and allows comparison of the global gas kinematics derived from hi mapping with the gas motions within the region of higher density , around the sites of sf .",
    "these kind of studies , initiated by @xcite for a small sample of luminous bcgs , already provide good evidence for merger - induced sf in such objects .",
    "some indications for the same phenomenon have been observed by @xcite for a group of five other luminous bcgs and by @xcite for representatives of the similar group of luminous compact blue galaxies .",
    "the starbursting xmd galaxies are especially interesting in this aspect , since the results may have implications for cosmological young galaxies in the high - redshift universe .",
    "the evidence of significantly disturbed optical morphology and interactions , indicating an unrelaxed state of many xmd galaxies , was already noticed by us ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recently by @xcite .",
    "how does this relate to the origin of xmd galaxies ?",
    "there are several options for evolutionary scenarios of xmd dwarf galaxies , already emphasized in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "two of them relate to gas - rich discs , which are very stable locally , and being isolated , have been evolving very slowly ( like lsb galaxies ) .",
    "some of them might even remain dark objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( and , thus , ` pristine ' like protogalaxies at epochs of the major galaxy formation ) .",
    "such galaxies would be very difficult to discover / recognise before they ( by chance ) have experienced a strong external perturbation due to an interaction with a galaxy - sized mass .",
    "when this happens , such galaxies can lose their global stability and experience a substantial sf burst .",
    "due to their slow evolution , during the starburst they would appear as gas - rich and very metal - poor ( xmd ) objects .",
    "therefore , the study of gas kinematics for the sample of xmd galaxies can shed light on their origin as a group , or can give clues to the diversity of their properties and their finer classification .",
    "in this paper we present the results of an h@xmath4 study of the ionized gas kinematics in nine xmd starbursting galaxies ( bcgs ) conducted with the sao 6-m telescope s scanning fabry - perot interferometer ( fpi ) .",
    "these galaxies constitute a part of a larger xmd galaxy sample , for which we conduct a multiwavelength study of their properties .",
    "most were selected for this fpi h@xmath4 study due to their unusual or disturbed optical morphology . for a fraction of them , the hi mapping data are available , which provide an opportunity of the combined view on the gas kinematics .",
    "we plan to continue this project for a larger sample of xmd starbursting galaxies in order to improve statistics and to search for possible differences in the properties of the ionized gas kinematics .",
    "due to volume limitations , the scope of this paper is kept mainly to observational results for the studied xmd galaxy subsample and their preliminary analysis .",
    "the more advanced analysis , involving multiwavelength data and new methods of modelling ( like suggested by * ? ? ?",

    "in table  [ t : list ] we present the summary of the main observational parameters of the studied xmd galaxies . since the accuracy of our total h@xmath4 flux estimates ( 1030 per cent ) is in general worse than that for dedicated h@xmath4 photometry , we give our values only for unknown h@xmath4 fluxes . for the remaining objects , we cite data from the literature .",
    "absolute magnitudes , m@xmath9 , are calculated for distances taken from ned , except for hs  0822 + 3542 and its companion lsb dwarf . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "they are situated in the region with large peculiar negative radial velocities ( @xmath3300  km  s@xmath5 ) due to the effect of the huge local void @xcite .",
    "so to derive their distances , this peculiar velocity was accounted for .",
    "the dominant or important mode of gas motions in late - type , low - mass isolated galaxies ( even for objects with luminosities corresponding to m@xmath10 fainter than 14.0 ) is rotation in a gravitational field of a dark matter ( dm ) halo and baryonic disc .",
    "two types of processes can significantly affect the regular velocity field attributed to rotation : the star formation activity and tidal interactions .",
    "the strong sf activity releases a significant amount of kinetic and thermal energy in short periods , and it results in the formation of hot bubbles and shells with typical sizes of a hundred pc to about one kpc .",
    "such shells , with maximal observed line - of - sight velocities in the range of ten to a hundred km  s@xmath5  are recognised in both long - slit spectra and 2d h@xmath4 velocity fields of star - forming galaxies . in principle , the large - scale velocity fields in such expanding ionized shells are sufficiently simple .",
    "however , in case of dwarf galaxies , which have relatively small rotation velocities , shells can significantly perturb the disc velocity field . in appendix  [ app1 ]",
    "we present the simulated velocity field of dwarf galaxies with shells for several simple cases . using the characteristic parameters typical of our sample ( disc size , inclination , rotation curve , etc . ) , we describe the technique for such shells recognition and masking in the observed velocity fields . fortunately , in many simple theoretical scenarios it is possible to extract the real parameters of global rotation , even when the shell expansion velocity is larger than the line - of - sight projection of global rotation on given radii .",
    "it is not yet well understood how the strength of starbursts and that of related expanding bubbles are connected with internal or external triggers .",
    "but , since the external perturbations ( e.g. , due to galaxy collisions or extragalactic cloud infall ) provide disturbances which are additional to internal ones , they are naturally expected to trigger the stronger disturbances in galactic gas and to result in more intense star formation . besides , in general , the characteristic timescales of singular star - forming events in isolated low - mass galaxies ( of ten to several tens myr ) are shorter than those for the events induced by external interactions .",
    "the latter are comparable to rotation periods , and usually are of the order of a hundred myr and more , the typical timescale for galaxy response to a collision - induced perturbation .",
    "this is due to different spatial scales involved in such sf episodes . for internal perturbations",
    "we usually have some local enhancement , while for external ones the gas flows on scales of the whole galactic disc are involved .",
    "therefore , one can expect rather different effects in isolated and interacting starbursting galaxies . in the former",
    ", the gas velocity field should display the characteristic rotation pattern with rather localised disturbances due to the starburst - related shells .",
    "more or less typical dirr galaxies can serve as templates for such kinematics . in the interaction - induced starbursts one can observe , besides the overall rotation and the appearance of shell kinematics , the effects of tidally disturbed velocity fields to various degrees . in extreme cases of a major merger ,",
    "the strong disturbance of the initial equilibrium rotation field can almost wash out the regular component .    apart from non - destructing ( fly - by )",
    "collisions , various types of mergers ( major , intermediate mass - ratio , and minor [ m@xmath11:m@xmath12 @xmath13 5 ] ) can trigger late - type galaxy starbursts . depending on the stage and mass proportion , the velocity fields can show various patterns  from very disturbed with no traces of regular rotation to more or less regular rotation with residual motions ( e.g. counter - rotation in the central region , where a smaller component has sunk as the result of minor merger ) . as recent simulations demonstrate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the bifurcations in velocity curves should appear ( that is prominent asymmetries in receding and approaching branches of rotation curves ) as a result of close recent encounters .",
    "various appearances of complex velocity fields resulting from major mergers of disc galaxies were demonstrated by @xcite .      from the above discourse",
    "it is clear that it is quite natural to analyse h@xmath4 velocity fields in the studied xmd dwarf galaxies by trying to fit them with a model of a flat rotating disc and to compare the residual velocity field against various patterns characteristic of shells , warps , central counter - rotation , discontinuities , etc .",
    "of course , the morphology of both stellar continuum and h@xmath4 emission should be taken into account in the course of the results interpretation .",
    "we analysed the velocity fields using the well - known approximation of a thin rotating disc ( tilted - rings method ) , which is generally accepted in analysis of gas kinematics . for the method description and references to the original works ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this method calculates the disc orientation parameters ( major axis position angle @xmath14 , inclination @xmath15 , systemic velocity @xmath16 ) together with radial variations of the rotation velocity @xmath17 . in special cases of non - circular motions",

    "are indicated with errors in the table  [ t : fit_disc ] . for j0113 + 0052 and sao  0822 + 3545",
    ", we adopted the inclinations from published hi maps . in the remaining cases , to estimate the inclination angle we adopted the approach based on the morphology of the overall h@xmath4 emission and the observed ratio of minor to major axis of h@xmath4 ` ellipsoid ' @xmath19=@xmath20 . assuming that this reflects the real gas distribution for an inclined ` thick ' ( typical of dwarf galaxies ) disc with the intrinsic axial ratio @xmath21",

    "the estimate of parameter @xmath21 was adopted according to formula a6 from @xcite .",
    "we understand that in many cases , where we infer strong disturbances in morphology and velocity field , the above assumption can be hardly justified , and hence the adopted inclination angle and the related amplitude of rotation velocity can be rather uncertain .",

    "the general velocity gradient along the ew direction ( about minor axis ) is clearly seen in this component .",
    "the velocity dispersion is rather low ( 10 - 20  km  s@xmath5 ) in all hii - regions around current sf sites , where the intensity of h@xmath4 show local peaks .",
    "the latter is common for the majority of other studied sf galaxies .",

    "the gmrt hi velocity field for this object from @xcite , which shows consistent features with our h@xmath4 velocity field in the overlapping regions , is helpful for the choice of the best - fitting model .",
    "therefore we accepted the value of disc inclination from those hi maps . the next parameters ",
    "the systemic velocity of kinematic centre , and the @xmath14 of major kinematic axis were derived from our h@xmath4 data .",
    "there is no well defined photometric centre .",
    "therefore , the rotation centre was determined only from the symmetry of the velocity field .",
    "its position also agrees ( within a few arcsec ) with the centre of hi distribution and rotation as it follows from the gmrt data .",
    "a model was constructed only for @xmath30 arcsec ; since in the inner region the number of points with the measured velocities is small and we fail to construct the stable model . in the outer regions the circular rotation model fits well the observed velocity field .",
    "the values of residual velocities in general do not exceed 510  km  s@xmath5 , reaching @xmath2915  km  s@xmath5  in several regions .",
    "the latter are still smaller than the observed amplitude of the rotation curve ( 18  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the largest non - random residual velocities ( both negative and positive ) are seen in the region of ugc  772  s. this looks like a more or less systematic gradient with the full range of @xmath330  km  s@xmath5 .    due to the patchy structure of ionized gas and",
    "the evident problems with a simple modelization of its global velocity field , it is important to compare the h@xmath4 velocity field with a lower resolution , but much better sampled motions of hi as seen , e.g. , in hi maps obtained with gmrt in @xcite . in particular , as well seen in their fig .  9 ( right ) for the fwhm beam of 15@xmath710  arcsec ,",
    "the gas velocities observed in hi , in both the main body and ugc  772  s , correspond well to those measured in h@xmath4 .",
    "the general direction of the hi velocity gradient is close to ns within the main optical body in accord with the ionized gas motions .",
    "however , one can see strong deviations of hi velocities near ugc  772  s ( and the related hi - density peak ) , and in the southern part of the hi ` disc ' .",
    "they look like an additional , smaller velocity component with the gradient being roughly along the ew direction .",
    "the other indications on the strong tidal hi protrusions are seen in their map in fig .",
    "9 ( left ) .",
    "the h@xmath4 velocity field in ugc  772  s also shows a gradient close to the ew direction , and thus , ionized gas motions are coherent with those of hi .",
    "these kinematically and spatially decoupled components of ugc  772 suggest that we are witnessing a dwarf galaxy merger stage ( the main body of ugc  772 and ugc  772  s ) , probably close to coalescence .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the region ugc  772  s as a supergiant hii region on the edge of a dwarf galaxy looks quite improbable due to three facts : ( i ) the strong disturbance of the overall hi morphology , ( ii ) the occurrence of the galaxy s highest hi density peak in the edge region is very unusual for an isolated galaxy , and ( iii ) the velocity field in this region is clearly detached from the main galaxy motions .",
    "ugc  772 is situated in a small group of gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , such galaxy collision looks quite probable .",
    "the current starburst in ugc  772 and in this smaller southern companion galaxy is then most probably triggered by their collision .",
    "this is one more rather extended object with very complex morphology and kinematics .",
    "the body , in both continuum and h@xmath4 , represents a group of seven bright knots ( sf regions ) superimposed on a lsb component .",
    "they are visually joined into two aggregates of similar size .",
    "the velocity field looks rather regular with two regions of clear gradient with the same direction and sign and the velocity ranges of @xmath3100 and @xmath360  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the regions roughly correspond to the w and e parts of the body .",
    "the velocity dispersion in most of the galaxy body , and in particular , around the sf knots , is quite low : @xmath310 - 30  km  s@xmath5 . as in the previous galaxy , it is enhanced up to 50 - 60  km  s@xmath5  in several areas between hii regions .    guided by its morphology and the appearance of its velocity field , we model this object with two rotating discs in contact ( see figure  [ fig : results_p1 ] ) . the first component , on the western edge ,",
    "is fitted with @xmath31=2953@xmath292  km  s@xmath5 , @xmath14=295@xmath295 , and with model - derived @xmath32 .",
    "maximal rotation velocities ( after inclination correction ) reach @xmath330  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the second component , at the eastern edge , is best modelled with @xmath31=2927@xmath292  km  s@xmath5 , @xmath14=285@xmath293 , and @xmath15=69   ( estimated from its axial ratio ) . for this component ,",
    "the inclination corrected , maximal rotation velocity reaches @xmath350  km  s@xmath5 . resulting residual velocities",
    "appear rather small ( @xmath338  km  s@xmath5 ) in most of the mapped area .",
    "the largest positive values of residuals are seen south of the bright hii region of the western component and on the nw of the eastern component .",
    "they may be the tracers of current interaction or outflows .",
    "the two prominent , but relatively compact regions of negative residuals ( near the kinematic centre and near the se edge ) in the eastern component can be related to shells around recent starbursts . or",
    "alternatively , the latter can be the tidally disturbed gas with counter - motion relative to that at the nw edge .",
    "for the case of modelling ugc  993 by a single rotating disc ( as the first guess ) , the overall residual velocities were by a factor of two and more larger .",
    "the recent hi maps obtained at gmrt ( ekta et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) show clear evidence of disturbed structure , with the large low - density hi plume stretching to the angular distance of @xmath26 arcmin to the south of a denser hi envelope that covers the optical body of the galaxy .",
    "the whole hi gas shows very complex kinematics . in the regions , where the h@xmath4 emission is well traced",
    ", hi displays the velocity pattern similar to that presented here in h@xmath4 .",
    "all available morphology and kinematics data suggest that in ugc  993 , we are witnessing a rather rare case of dwarf galaxy encounter in contact , when they have well traced regular velocity fields of both components .",
    "the kinematic data suggests that the real distance between the colliding galaxies is significantly larger , and their visible contact is due to projection effects . the strong sf activity in many hii regions , presumably triggered by the recent strong interaction , is spread over the components bodies .",
    "from the model fit of the observed velocity field , the deprojected rotation velocity in the e component is a factor of @xmath31.6 larger , and hence , its estimated total mass should be also significantly larger .",
    "if the tully - fisher scaling is valid for the two discs in collision ( m@xmath34v@xmath35 ) , the e component can be @xmath35 times more massive .",
    "this would imply a case of minor merger .",
    "however , rather similar sizes of the two galaxies in question ( as best followed namely through h@xmath4 velocity field ) and a strong hi tidal plum mentioned above , are strong evidence for a major merger .",
    "the above large difference in rotation velocities can be due to two factors : ( i ) not properly correcting for inclination angle in the w component , ( ii ) the velocity fields themselves are affected by strong interactions , so the tully - fisher relation may be not applicable . to construct a more self - consistent model , one needs to combine both h@xmath4 and hi velocity fields , as well as some additional photometry including near - ir data .",
    "this will be attempted in a forthcoming analysis .",
    "the sf galaxy sbs  0335052w is the most metal - poor gas - rich object with an o / h range in different knots between 6.9 @xmath0 12+@xmath1(o / h ) @xmath07.22 @xcite .",
    "with sbs  0335052e ( at 22 kpc in projection , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it comprises a unique pair of interacting / merging gas - rich dwarfs with the lowest metallicities .",
    "both galaxies show unusually blue stellar population in the outer parts of their optical images @xcite .",
    "the ratio m(hi)/l@xmath9@xmath35 for sbs  0335052w is one of the greatest known .",
    "the recent detailed study of its disturbed hi kinematics and morphology with gmrt is presented by @xcite . it suggests a merger of extended gas bodies soon after the first encounter .",
    "however , the denser central regions of both galaxies , with regions of current sf and surrounding ionized gas , are separated at a significant distance , and can be thus less susceptible to an external disturbance .",
    "therefore , one can hope that kinematics of their innermost ionized gas can keep information on galaxy original rotation .",
    "due to the recent close encounter between e and w galaxies , the gas motions are significantly affected by the tidal torques , especially in the outer parts of colliding galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas kinematics in the innermost parts can be affected by current / recent sf episodes .",
    "one of the important issues in understanding this unusual interacting pair is the following : why do the optical luminosities and sfrs of e and w galaxies differ by an order of magnitude , while their global hi properties are pretty similar ? in principle , the substantial part of the answer can be related to differences in the geometry of collision for two components and the related strength of tidal action .",
    "indeed , the high resolution gmrt maps of the innermost hi gas give evidence for a significant difference in the main velocity gradients in e and w galaxies .",
    "for the orbital plane sky projection close to the ew direction , the collision of the e galaxy is closer to a retrograde one .",
    "meanwhile , the innermost velocity field of the w galaxy , having its main gradient in the n - s direction , corresponds to an almost polar collision .",
    "this would imply a less effective tidal perturbation .",
    "our fpi h@xmath4 velocity field allows a consistent check of the hi data .",
    "the observed ionized gas velocity field of the w galaxy looks like a combination of two components .",
    "one , centred at the bright hii region , shows a very small gradient , with an amplitude of less than @xmath310  km  s@xmath5  and the direction close to n  s .",
    "the other reflects the gas motion between two peaks of h@xmath4 emission ( mainly in e ",
    "w direction ) and has the amplitude of @xmath320 - 25  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the ` best - fitting ' model of rotating disc describes primarily the latter motion , which seems to be related to the tidal flows seen in hi maps",
    ". however , the pa @xmath370 , accounts for the former component .",
    "thus , the h@xmath4 kinematics gives additional evidence on the presence of a velocity component roughly in n - s direction , well seen in the high - resolution hi maps .",
    "the fainter hii region , 3 arcsec east of the main star - forming region , is situated along the direction , which is closer to the direction of the compact hi tidal protrusion , well seen in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite . by analogy with the discussed opportunity of stimulated sf in asymmetric shells prompted by tidal outflows in the case of e galaxy @xcite",
    ", the similar situation can take place for w galaxy ( albeit , with smaller power ) .",
    "the ionized gas kinematics of sbs  0335052e were studied by @xcite on the limited region of @xmath36 arcsec around the central star - forming regions . in that work the general velocity field",
    "was not discussed .",
    "instead , they find the two - component h@xmath4-line profiles in several periphery regions , with component separation of @xmath350  km  s@xmath5 , which were treated as the appearance of fast shells . in our observations",
    "we constructed the h@xmath4 velocity field in the region of @xmath37 arcsec in size .",
    "similar to the w component , we compare the motions of ionized gas in the e galaxy with that of hi gas in the same region .",
    "this comparison is conducted on the gmrt hi maps with the angular resolutions of @xmath320 arcsec and 9 arcsec .",
    "since the respective analysis was already performed in @xcite , this allows us to look at the observed h@xmath4 velocities in a more general context .",
    "namely , there are two systems in the hi velocity field , which are identified with gas motions in elongated tidal tails .",
    "a longer and more rarefied one is directed in approximately sw - ne direction with velocities growing to the ne edge , that is in direction opposite to the position of the companion .",
    "a shorter , curved denser tail starts roughly in direction to nw and then bends to the w companion . for this tail ( protrusion ) , the velocity decreases while gas travels further from the e galaxy .",
    "this direction is close to that of the asymmetric arc of ionized gas well seen in the _ hst _ @xmath38-band image of @xcite .    the coarse comparison of the observed h@xmath4 velocity field in fig .",
    "[ fig : results_p1 ] with that of the described hi one , shows qualitative agreement .",
    "the region of minimal line - of - sight velocities at @xmath367  arcsec nw from the central starburst is close to the position of the arc .",
    "thus , the effect of the expanding shell ( visible as relative negative velocities on its front side ) can also contribute to the structure of the velocity field .",
    "the significant swing of the isovelocity contours in the central region ( @xmath39 arcsec from the centre ) seems may be related to the appearance of an expanding shell . to check how the disturbed velocity field looks like in the presence of a shell ( in the zeroth approximation ) we consider in the appendix  [ app1 ] several simulated velocity fields of rotating disc with a shell in different positions .",
    "the observed velocity field of sbs  0335052e resembles that in our model  3 , which implies an off - centre location of the shell centre on the disc minor axis . based on conclusions , obtained in appendix  [ app1 ]",
    ", we fixed the position angle of the model disc ( @xmath40 ) in accord with the orientation of the large - scale hi structure .",
    "this model of rotation takes into account the main component of the velocity gradient ( roughly from sw to ne ) . in the residual map one can clearly separate the same velocity minimum of the irregular form",
    "nw from the centre , related to the arc .",
    "the latter is natural to attribute to the approaching part of a shell , produced during a relatively recent episode of sf .",
    "having in mind its irregular form , one can think of a superposition of two spatially close shells .",
    "furthermore , the negative gradient in the nw direction is still visible , consistent with the similar flow seen along the hi nw tail .",
    "it is worth noting the unusual behaviour in the model fit of rotation velocity in the very centre of the galaxy , at @xmath41 arcsec .",
    "this can be treated as an appearance of kinematically decoupled counter - rotation , which could be a trace of merging gaseous clouds with the specific orientations of their angular momenta .",
    "however , the observed rotation velocities are too small . therefore , the more probable option is that this a feature of the velocity field appears due to non - circular motions produced by a shell formed near the disc centre .",
    "the galaxy sbs 0335052e , unlike sbs 0335052w , shows much more active star formation during the last several hundred myr .",
    "this induces both large - scale shells / arcs and increases the amplitude of chaotic ( turbulent ) motions .",
    "the local peculiarities of h@xmath4 kinematics are better acquired by high - resolution spectra with vlt in @xcite . in particular , they detected wide - spread regions outside the central brightest clusters 1 and 2 , where the line profiles are split on two components with velocity differences of @xmath350  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the ` broad ' lines with fwhm up to @xmath3100  km  s@xmath5  are present in these regions as well .",
    "while our angular resolution is about a factor of 1.7 worse , we also see in the corresponding regions the enhanced velocity dispersion of @xmath36070  km  s@xmath5 , corresponding to fwhm @xmath3150  km  s@xmath5 . accounting for smoothing due to the worse seeing ,",
    "these values look consistent .",
    "in fact , as the illustration in fig .  [",
    "fig : line_prof ] shows , our data also hint at the two - peak structure of line profiles in the mentioned regions , but due to insufficient velocity resolution they can be treated only as an indication .",
    "summarising the overall ionized gas kinematics of the e galaxy , we conclude , that in accord with hi kinematics @xcite , its direction of rotation is closer to the orbital plane . in general , we assume that before the merging galaxies experience coalescence , their innermost regions keep the information on their original rotation . in difference with the w galaxy case ( polar collision ) , the collision of the e galaxy is closer to prograde or retrograde . as emphasized by @xcite",
    ", the latter may be one of the reasons of large differences in the current and earlier sfrs between e and w galaxies .      the h@xmath4 velocity field for this bcg is rather well fitted by the model of flat rotating disc .",
    "the rotation velocity curve raises up to @xmath313  km  s@xmath5   at the radius @xmath42 arcsec ( @xmath3200 pc ) and then falls to @xmath43  km  s@xmath5   at radius of @xmath44 arcsec .",
    "the region with the maximal residual velocity ( of @xmath310  km  s@xmath5 ) is positioned at a secondary peak of h@xmath4 emission at @xmath45 arcsec nw of the main starburst region .",
    "this could be the brightest fragment of a large loop , a probable relic of a somewhat earlier star - forming episode .",
    "the comparison of h@xmath4 kinematics with hi morphology and kinematics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) leads to interesting conclusions . at the highest angular resolution of @xmath46 arcsec ,",
    "the related hi cloud is strongly elongated in the n ",
    "s direction .",
    "the brightest hii region is situated between two hi density peaks . due to low s / n ratio",
    ", the hi velocity field is constructed only for the low - resolution datacube ( beam@xmath325 arcsec ) .",
    "this has a general ( but small ) gradient in approximately n  s direction .",
    "however , in the vicinity of the optical body one can see the swing of isovelocity line , roughly in the direction close to the pa of h@xmath4 velocity gradient .",
    "the most probable reason for the formation of decoupled kinematic patterns - the internal as visible in ionized gas , and near polar orbits as outlined by hi - is the interaction with a nearby lsb dwarf sao 0822 + 3545 .",
    "the latter is also mapped in h@xmath4 in the same observations and is discussed in a subsection  [ sec : lsb ] .",
    "this lsbd is situated at the projected distance of 3.8 arcmin ( @xmath315  kpc ) and has line - of - sight velocity of only @xmath315  km  s@xmath5  larger .",
    "it is @xmath33 times more massive in hi and @xmath30.35  mag more luminous in @xmath24-band than hs  0822 + 3542 @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects that the past interaction of the bcg progenitor with this lsbd could induce a starburst in hs 0822 + 3542 .",
    "@xcite , from their hubble space telescope imaging of hs  0822 + 3542 with the spatial resolution of @xmath35  pc , found that its central sf region consists of two distinct components with projected separation of @xmath380  pc .",
    "based on this morphology , they suggest that this very compact dwarf galaxy is currently being assembled from two tiny unrelated components .",
    "our h@xmath4 kinematics of this bcg , in difference to several other galaxies in this study , is rather well fit by a single disc [ albeit disturbed by the earlier starburst(s ) and related shell(s ) ] .",
    "this is difficult to match with the idea that the bcg is currently forming from two unrelated fragments .",
    "it is worth noting that this h@xmath4 kinematics and hi data from @xcite for hs  0822 + 3542 do not provide a comprehensive picture of the overall gas motions .",
    "indeed , on one hand , the regular h@xmath4 rotation within the whole region of optical emission ( with the total extent of @xmath316 arcsec , or @xmath31  kpc ) , has an amplitude of @xmath313  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , hi data shows rotation with an amplitude of less than 5  km  s@xmath5 . at the moment it is unclear",
    "how much the beam - smearing affects the hi velocity data .      in the sdss colour image , this galaxy is elongated along the e ",
    "w direction , with an extent of @xmath310 arcsec .",
    "the extent along the n ",
    "s direction is @xmath34 arcsec .",
    "the brightest part , the ` comet head ' on the w edge , is very blue ; while the more diffuse tail with a second , eastern ` peak ' at @xmath34 arcsec is somewhat redder .",
    "the analysis of surface brightness and colour radial dependencies by @xcite confirms this impression .",
    "they use the blue colours of a lower sb part of this object to infer the small ages of the underlying lsb disc .",
    "however , reservation are made on the possible significant contribution of nebular emission to its colour , that should be accounted for . indeed , from our rather deep h@xmath4 image , the extent of the galaxy nebular emission ( @xmath47 arcsec ) appears to be similar to that of the sdss continuum images .",
    "the two - nuclei morphology of this galaxy is similar to that of other studied objects ( hs  2236 + 1344 , sbs  1159 + 545 ) , for which their h@xmath4 kinematics show good evidence for a merger event . the simple disc model that best fits the observed h@xmath4 velocity field has the following parameters : @xmath31 = 3865@xmath291  km  s@xmath5 , @xmath14=273 , @xmath15=51 .",
    "the bright rotating core is well fit by a rotation centre shifted to the east by @xmath30.5 arcsec from the photometric centre .",
    "the maximal observed ( not corrected for inclination ) rotation velocity is 89  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this peak is well seen on the model rotation curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] at @xmath48 arcsec .",
    "the residual velocities in the ` core ' region ( @xmath49 arcsec ) are small ( @xmath0 5  km  s@xmath5 ) . in outer regions",
    "the regular rotation falls significantly , and the residual velocities amount up to 1015  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the fitting by a flat disc model with the maximal rotation velocity of @xmath310  km  s@xmath5  results in rather small overall residuals .",
    "however , the two outer regions of the e component show residuals of up to @xmath2920  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "namely in these regions we see a maximal velocity dispersion of up to 50  km  s@xmath5 . besides , the radial dependence of rotation velocity is quite atypical with a substantial fall after the maximum at @xmath48 arcsec .",
    "this suggests that the gas kinematics of the eastern half of the galaxy are significantly disturbed . on the colour sdss image",
    ", one can also see a redder , diffuse extension south of the main elongated body .",
    "all these properties are evidence for an unrelaxed state of this galaxy",
    ".    the available data are not sufficient to make a confident conclusion on the nature of this object . at the current level of understanding of its morphology and gas kinematics",
    ", the data do not contradict an idea that this is the result of a relatively minor , almost completed merger .",
    "other interpretations look more problematical .",
    "the eastern component has a significantly smaller mass than the western one , in difference with , e.g. , the case of hs  2236 + 1344 .",
    "this results in a relatively weak velocity disturbance in the w component and a much fainter luminosity of e component in respect of that for w one .",
    "high - resolution hi mapping could probably produce a more complete picture of its dynamics during the last few hundred myr .",
    "this xmd bcg has a complex morphology in the central part , which consists of three knots with very different fluxes situated in a region with a total extent of @xmath50 arcsec ( as first noticed by * ? ? ?",
    "the outer parts also show rather irregular morphology with finger - like protrusions , in particular on the s and e edges .",
    "while the full range of line - of - sight velocities in h@xmath4 is more than 80  km  s@xmath5 , the velocity field is rather complex .",
    "it is hard to see tracers of regular rotation .",
    "nevertheless , we try to construct the model of rotating disc for radial distances @xmath51 arcsec , which we extrapolate to the outer region .",
    "the centre of the inner isophotes was set as the centre of rotation .",
    "as one expects , the rotation is indeed small : its maximal observed line - of - sight velocities are of order 510  km  s@xmath5 , while the residual velocities are @xmath320  km  s@xmath5 in the central part and reach the value of @xmath350  km  s@xmath5  at the e and se periphery .",
    "the region with the most peculiar ( redshifted ) velocities is situated south - east from the bright ` central ' knot and possibly represents the result of a merger ( or infall to the disc ) .",
    "while the ` best - fitting ' model with rotation can account for maximal rotation velocity of @xmath31012  km  s@xmath5 , the resulting residual velocity field shows the regions with values down to 20  km  s@xmath5  and up to + 50  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this very disturbed velocity field , especially in outer parts of an ionized gas body , suggests strong perturbation .",
    "the presence of expanding shells from recent starbursts is probably one of the possible reasons . if one assigns the regions with the most negative velocities on the residual map to approaching fronts of such shells , their expansion velocities are @xmath320  km  s@xmath5  and the total sizes are @xmath335  arcsec ( or @xmath3300500  pc at the adopted distance of 23  mpc ) .",
    "the sizes are quite typical of ionized - gas shells , visible in similar galaxies . however , the large positive residual velocity at the eastern edge of the galaxy is difficult to reconcile with shells .",
    "the morphology of h@xmath4-emission region and velocity fields , both the observed and residual , suggests strong external disturbance . no candidate galaxy capable of producing that strong of a disturbance is visible in the bcg environment .",
    "therefore , the most natural interpretation that emerges from the study of sbs  1116 + 517 morphology and gas kinematics is the recent major merger of dwarf galaxies , since for a minor merger one expects a relatively weak effect on the overall velocity field of the more massive component .",
    "if this picture is correct , one should expect that the hi morphology and velocity field are highly disturbed .",
    "thus , this galaxy requires follow - up hi mapping with angular resolution of 35  arcsec .      on the sdss image sbs  1159 + 545",
    "consists of two very blue knots ( separated by @xmath50 arcsec , or @xmath31.3  kpc at the adopted distance of 52.5  mpc ) , elongated roughly along ne  sw direction , with the luminosity difference of a factor @xmath32 .",
    "there are also redder lower brightness fragments ; one is situated between the two blue knots and the other , with the total extent of @xmath50 arcsec , stretches as a tail of the fainter , blue sw knot . the sw knot itself",
    "has an extended structure , roughly oriented along e  w , and its redder tail looks like a continuation of this blue knot . on the other hand , the brighter ne knot also looks elongated on our narrow red continuum image , in a direction of s ",
    "this overall complex , curved morphology indicates a non - equilibrium state of this object .",
    "the full range of h@xmath4 velocities seen in our data is @xmath340  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the velocity field is complex , and does not resemble a projected rotation . moreover , it resembles that of some other objects in this study , with ` two - nuclei ' morphology , which we have argued are mergers close to the full coalescence ( sdss j1044 + 0353 and hs  2236 + 1344 ) .",
    "namely , there are two local maxima in the line - of - sight velocity , close to the positions of the h@xmath4-emission peaks and a clear minimum along the border , or ` middle ' lane , between these sf knots . from the position of this middle lane , the observed velocities grow to both ne and sw directions . however , after reaching the local maxima near the h@xmath4 emission peaks they again fall .",
    "the largest velocities are seen on the w and e edges of the ne knot as well as at similar outer parts of the sw knot .",
    "the velocity field model was built for the range @xmath52 arcsec ( with the centre at the ne knot ) and was extrapolated to the sw knot .",
    "the ` best - fitting ' model for the flat rotating disc centred on the brighter ne knot can account for only an amplitude of @xmath38  km  s@xmath5along the line - of - sight .",
    "the residual velocities are significantly larger , amounting on the knot s east edge of 1520  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "similar indications of an overdisturbed velocity field come from the map of velocity dispersion . while in the regions around bright knots",
    ", this parameter does not exceed 1520  km  s@xmath5 . in the e part of ne knot and the w part of the sw knot , this exceeds 3050 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath14=13of the ` best - fitting ' kinematic model significantly differs from @xmath14@xmath53  of the apparent ` disc ' plane  if the two knots were hii regions in the same disc galaxy .",
    "but this is consistent with the orientation of the ne knot itself , as seen from our narrow band continuum image .",
    "an attempt to interpret the whole velocity field as a result of combination of two expanding shells does not work . in this model , it is difficult to understand how the gas in the middle lane acquired its low observed velocity , while the line - of - sight velocities in the directions of expected centres of shells ( ne and sw knots ) show local maxima .",
    "summarising this velocity field analysis , we suggest that from both the bcg morphology and gas velocity field , the most plausible interpretation of the data is the merger of two dwarf galaxies .",
    "this xmd bcg also has the two - nuclei morphology with disturbed outer parts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results_p3 ] ) .",
    "the separation of two bright knots , oriented in the n ",
    "s direction , is @xmath54 arcsec ( or @xmath31.2 kpc in projection at the adopted distance of 85  mpc ) . as seen in deep images ( not shown here ) , the latter includes small tails protruding from both the northern edge of the n component ( to the w ) and from the southern part of the s component ( pustilnik et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "these features already hint on the tidal perturbations in both components .",
    "@xcite studied the h@xmath4 velocity field of this object with a long slit , positioned along the n ",
    "s direction .",
    "they discovered in the position - velocity diagram that the line - of - sight velocity makes a jump in the middle between the two knots .",
    "our h@xmath4 velocity field confirms that finding and adds important new features , including high velocity dispersion and large residual velocities near the regions of current starbursts for any model of single rotating disc .",
    "the total velocity range is @xmath345  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "we attempted to fit the whole observed velocity field with the model of single flat rotating disc .",
    "two variants of the circular motion model were constructed : ( i ) rotation centre coincides with the brighter ( southern ) knot ; ( ii ) rotation centre is fixed in the middle between northern and southern knots .",
    "however , both variants fail to reproduce the observed velocity gradients . for an alternative approach",
    ", the approximation of the overall h@xmath4 velocity field by two rotating discs , positioned near the centres of s and n knots , gives a good fit with maximal rotation velocities of @xmath325  km  s@xmath5  in both components ( see table [ t : fit_disc ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : results_p3 ] and [ fig : models ] ) .",
    "these discs have close @xmath14 , v@xmath18 , @xmath15 and maximal v@xmath25 .    due to lack of space , we focus on the model with two discs which provides a better fit to the observations than either single disc model .",
    "the map of velocity dispersion shows this parameter to be rather large in this bcg .",
    "even its minimal values , located in the regions of both bright knots , are of @xmath325  km  s@xmath5 . in the adjacent regions ,",
    "this parameter raises till 35 - 40  km  s@xmath5 , while in the outer parts , the velocity dispersion exceeds 50  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the observed kinematics can not be explained as well by giant ionized shells in a single rotating disc .",
    "the latter are commonly expected to show negative relative velocities in their front edges , that is near the centres of star - forming regions , while the observed residuals are positive .",
    "taking into account all available morphological and kinematics data on this bcg , we conclude that the most likely nature of this object is a close strongly interacting pair of dwarf galaxies with comparable masses .",
    "it is quite probable that this pair is in the stage of merger close to full coalescence .",
    "this also provides a natural interpretation of the starbursts in both components .",
    "indeed , as summarised by @xcite , the late - type quiet dwarfs with that low v@xmath25 have typical m@xmath9 in the range of 12.5 to 14.9 .",
    "therefore , the m@xmath9=16.9 for hs  2236 + 1344 indicates a very strong starburst .      in this section",
    "we briefly discuss two galaxies that appeared sufficiently close on spatial and velocity separation to the main studied xmd galaxy and were mapped along with the main target .      in the fpi datacube for ugc  993 , an lsb dwarf galaxy anon j012544 + 075957 appeared ( see bottom of table  [ t : list ] ) at 2.5 arcmin east and @xmath55 arcsec north from the main target ( @xmath329 kpc in projection ) .",
    "its line - of - sight velocity ( as found here from its h@xmath4 velocity field ) is @xmath370  km  s@xmath5  larger than the mean velocity of the ugc  993 system . its h@xmath4 image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results_p3 ] ) displays three main regions elongated roughly from ne to sw , forming the main body with the total extent of @xmath56 arcsec and a separate faint knot sw from this .",
    "the velocity range along the body is @xmath370  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the ` best - fitting ' model parameters for a rotating thin disc are as follows : v@xmath18=3012  km  s@xmath5 , @xmath14=324 , @xmath15=64 .",
    "the resulting rotation curve reaches a maximum value of @xmath325  km  s@xmath5(fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] ) at the edge of the h@xmath4 map ( @xmath57 arcsec ) .",
    "the gas morphology of this lsb galaxy is clearly disturbed and elongated nearly perpendicular to the plane of rotation .",
    "it is interesting that in the blue continuum , the galaxy looks less elongated than in h@xmath4 . however , there are two extensions approximately to the n and s , close to the elongation of h@xmath4 emission .",
    "the velocity dispersion near the peaks of h@xmath4 emission is a modest @xmath325  km  s@xmath5 . in some of the outer regions ,",
    "it raises up to 60 - 70  km  s@xmath5 , but this is probably attributed to a low s / n ratio .",
    "along with the already discussed two kinematically decoupled components of ugc  993 , this dwarf irr galaxy likely comprises a progenitor triplet of low - mass galaxies , whose common dynamical evolution resulted in a recent merger , as seen in ugc  993 .",
    "the general problem of such dwarf bound systems was addressed , in particular , in @xcite .",
    "another by - product object , sao  0822 + 3545 , the lsb dwarf galaxy , known as a companion of hs  0822 + 3542 , was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "its unusually blue bvr colours imply a rather small age for its main stellar population",
    ". low level sf in this lsbd was noted in the latter study based on the detection of a low ew h@xmath4 emission in the long - slit spectrum taken along the major axis .",
    "the new data show the 2d distribution of h@xmath4 emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : results_p3 ] ) and allow us to perform a more careful analysis of sf issues .",
    "in particular , our h@xmath4 image shows that the current sf in this lsb dwarf is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "it is concentrated in two close hii regions no .  1 and 2 ( @xmath58 arcsec , or @xmath30.26  kpc in between ) at the northern edge of the main galaxy body , where no light concentration is seen in the broad - band continuum images .",
    "a fainter h@xmath4 protrusion is seen in the w part of the faint irregular structure .",
    "the h@xmath4 kinematics are complex . on one hand , due to very limited spatial coverage of h@xmath4 emission over the lsbd body , it is difficult to derive the parameters of a rotating disc model based only on h@xmath4 data . on the other hand ,",
    "the h@xmath4 velocities are in good agreement in the overlapping regions with those observed in hi as presented in @xcite . based on this fact , we fixed the position of the rotation centre , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , as they emerge from the mentioned hi maps .    as usual ,",
    "the velocity dispersion near the brightest h@xmath4 knots is rather low : @xmath35 - 15  km  s@xmath5 . in several regions outside these two knots , where h@xmath4 is still seen - at @xmath58 arcsec se of knot no .  1 and in the w protrusion - the velocity dispersion is large , up to 60 - 70  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this could be evidence of recent strong disturbances of the galaxy s ism .",
    "we also notice that the total h@xmath4 flux in this lsb galaxy is @xmath325 times smaller than that in its companion bcg hs  0822 + 3542 , while its total blue luminosity is @xmath330 per cent higher @xcite .",
    "this seemingly reflects the difference between the sf properties in the two interacting galaxies , related to the difference in their density distribution and the strength of the tidal trigger .",
    "summarising the results and discussion above , we draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the ionized gas kinematics in very low - metallicity star - forming galaxies , studied with fpi h@xmath4 observations are significantly disturbed and rarely can be well fitted by only single disc with regular rotation .",
    "2 .   several of our galaxies show more or less clear evidence from morphology and h@xmath4 velocity fields for various stages of mergers ( ugc  993 , sdss  j1044 + 0353 , sbs  1116 + 517 , sbs  1159 + 545 , hs  2236 + 1344 ) . in two cases we have good evidence for two independently rotating discs ( ugc  993 and hs  2236 + 1344 ) .",
    "3 .   in the other galaxies ,",
    "the rotation component of the overall velocity field is important , but large disturbances appear .",
    "the residuals of the ` best - fitting ' rotation model imply either a recent merger , or sufficiently strong disturbance by nearby galaxies ( hs  0822 + 3542 and ugc  772 ) .",
    "probable starburst - induced shells were identified in several galaxies ( ugc 772 , ugc  993 , sbs  0335052e , sbs  1116 + 517 ) through their ionized gas velocity fields and velocity dispersion maps .",
    "we presented the results of simple simulations of the expected velocity patterns which one can observe in dwarf galaxies with expanding shells .",
    "to first order , this allowed a feel for the effect of shells on the results of the tilted - ring model .",
    "the interacting / merging nature of the binary system of the well separated xmd galaxies sbs  0335052e and w is best evident from their hi morphology and kinematics data . despite a relatively large mutual distance , the tidal action of each component to",
    "the other clearly affects the gas dynamics of these very gas - rich objects and triggers the current sf burst and very likely the previous major sf episode . to understand this unique interacting system ( a nice representative of high - redshift young galaxies ) in more detail",
    ", one needs a wide grid of models of interacting gas - rich galaxies , like , e.g. , `` identikit '' @xcite , but including sf processes .",
    "the h@xmath4 images and velocity fields for two lsb dwarfs , anon  j012544 + 075957 and sao  0822 + 3545 , companions of two program xmd galaxies , are obtained and analysed .",
    "they can be used in statistical studies of sf in lsb dwarfs .",
    "the star formation in sao  0822 + 3545 is highly asymmetric and takes place mainly in two knots at the northern edge , that is likely induced by the recent interaction with the nearby xmd bcg hs  0822 + 3542 .",
    "the statistics of xmd starbursting galaxies , for which kinematics of gas were studied in detail , is still insufficient .",
    "nevertheless , the results of our fpi study of the ionized gas kinematics in the subsample of nine xmd star - forming galaxies , along with the complementary results of the gmrt hi study of a part of these and other xmd galaxies @xcite , indicate that strong interactions and mergers of very metal - poor dwarf galaxies are one of the major or significant factors triggering their current and recent starbursts . in particular , this is valid for the six most metal - poor ( 12+@xmath1(o / h)@xmath07.30 ) dwarf starbursting galaxies .",
    "merger - induced starbursts are consistent with the idea that the progenitors of such rare objects either are old and have been evolving very slowly on the cosmological timescale before the current starburst have occurred , or they are extremely metal - poor because they are comparatively young , and thus began their star formation and chemical enrichment with large delay .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",

    "the tilted - ring fit is very popular for analysis of gas velocity fields in galactic discs ( see @xcite for detailed review ) . in this approach , it is easy to connect the radial trends of kinematically determined @xmath14 and @xmath15 with real changes of disc geometrical parameters ( warp , polar rings , etc . ) and/or with regular non - circular motions caused by spiral arms or bar .",
    "however , in dwarf galaxies the sf - induced expanding shells can significantly disturb the disc velocity field since the amplitude of the rotation curve is rather small and the size of a shell can be comparable with the size of the disc . if we allow for variations of kinematical @xmath14 with radius , it can lead to a mistaken conclusion on disc orientation or about the character of non - circular motions . in this appendix",
    "we examine the effect of expanding shells on the tilted - ring fitting of artificial velocity fields .    the `",
    "observed ' velocities in our two - component model are simply the sum of line - of - sight velocities for the disc and the shell : @xmath59 this approximation assumes the equal contribution of both components in the total velocity pattern in the overlapping regions , i.e. , the same brightness of the components in each point .",
    "of course , this is not similar to the real situation .",
    "however , we believe that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) can be used as a first approximation .",
    "one of the constraints used in the models below is that @xmath60 should not exceed the typical @xmath6 of the observed emission lines ( about @xmath61  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "otherwise we would detect the two - component line profiles .",
    "the azimuthal angle in the plane of galaxy @xmath62 is connected with the position angle in the sky by the relation : @xmath63 .",
    "the rising rotation curve is constructed by the relation : @xmath64 with @xmath65 arcsec and the maximal velocity @xmath66  km  s@xmath5  which is typical of dwarf galaxies in our sample .",
    "for the shell , we use a model of a thin expanding hemisphere .",
    "this implies that we see only its approaching ( blueshifted ) side , whereas the redshifted one is obscured by an interior extinction .",
    "the model for the shell is : @xmath67 here @xmath68 and @xmath69 are sky - plane coordinates of the shell centre relative to the disc centre .",
    "the shell has a radius of @xmath70 arcsec and the expansion velocity of @xmath7115  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we created models for moderately inclined disc ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) with the maximal radius of 10 arcsec and with various values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "a systemic velocity of @xmath74  km  s@xmath5  was adopted , that is representative of our sample .",
    "its value has no effect on model isovelocity patterns .",
    "the models were calculated on the grid with cell size 0.1 arcsec",
    ". then the constructed models were convolved with the 2d gaussian with @xmath75 arcsec that simulated the typical seeing effect , and were rebinned with the pixel size of 0.5 arcsec in accord with our observational conditions .",
    "[ figa1 ] shows examples of typical simulated velocity fields .",
    "model  0 represents the disc without shell . in model  1 the shell",
    "is located in the disc centre . in model  2 and model  3 ,",
    "the centre of the shell is shifted along the major and the minor axes , respectively . in model  4",
    "the shell centre is shifted in the direction of @xmath76 .",
    "the simulated velocity fields were analysed with the same tilted - ring model method under two approximations .",
    "method  i allows for radial variations of @xmath14 and @xmath16 , while in method  ii these values were fixed and only the rotation velocity was a free parameter . the inclination angle and the rotation centre",
    "were fixed in both methods .",
    "[ figa1 ] shows the residual velocities in the both approximations .",
    "the results of fitting are shown in fig .",
    "[ figa2 ] .",
    "these figures demonstrate how an expanding shell affects the observed velocity field and changes the estimates of best - fitting parameters .",
    "namely , the central location of the shell , or its offset along the disc major axis provoke the radial variations of @xmath16 ( see models 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the shell location beyond the disc major axis also gives the systematic errors in the @xmath14 estimations ( models 3 and 4 ) .",
    "when the shell centre lies on the minor axis , the radial trend of @xmath14 reach the maximal amplitude ( @xmath320  in our simulations ) . that large variation of @xmath14 can result in erroneous conclusions concerning the disc structure , like the presence of the inner warp or even of a nuclear disc .",
    "the residual velocities in the case of method  i seem spread over a larger portion of the disc than the real area of the shell ( fig .",
    "[ figa1 ] ) .",
    "the residuals are relatively small , usually about @xmath295 - 7  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the peak of negative ( ` blue ' ) residuals usually does not coincide with the centre of the shell .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath14 and @xmath16 are constant ( i.e. , for method  ii ) , the residual velocities pattern is in a good agreement with the location of the shell , and the value of the negative residuals is consistent with @xmath77 , with except of the special case of model  2 .",
    "it is worth noting that the rotation curve derived from the simulated velocity field can be distorted independently of the analysis method , as can be seen for @xmath17 plots for models 2 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ figa2 ] .",
    "however , in the method  ii approach , we can unambiguously recognise from the residual map the perturbed portion of the disc and then derive the real rotation curve on the second iteration after masking the shell region .",
    "the latter is impossible if @xmath14 and @xmath16 are free parameters of the fitting , because in this case it is difficult to recognise the shell location .",
    "based on the results presented above , we have analysed the velocity fields of dwarf galaxies using the ` tilted - ring ' fitting assuming that @xmath14 and @xmath16 are constant with radius .",
    "when the first approximation was done , we masked the regions with large residuals ( usually , larger than @xmath78  km  s@xmath5 ) and repeated the fitting .",
    "the final model velocity field and the rotation curve , i.e. , parameters of the disc orientation were calculated after several such iterations ."
