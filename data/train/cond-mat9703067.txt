    "although many measurements now support the idea that the gap in the high - temperature cuprate superconductors has dominant @xmath8 character@xcite , an orthorhombic superconductor such as @xmath9 ( ybco ) can not be described as a purely tetragonal @xmath10-wave . in the orthorhombic symmetry group the @xmath11 and @xmath12wave basis function belong to the same irreducible representation ,",
    "so that one expects that the gap can be described as @xmath13wave with some @xmath12wave admixture , @xmath14 .",
    "the deviation from purely @xmath10-wave behavior is supported by the observations@xcite of josephson pair tunneling from pb into c - axis oriented ybco , although the variation of the josephson tunneling strength with twin density , the relative areas of the twins , and the possible role of josephson screening currents , remain open questions@xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that these results can be explained by the development of a complex order parameter at twin boundaries @xcite , or mixing of states with @xmath15 and @xmath8 symmetry at the pb - ybco interface@xcite .",
    "part of the problem of interpreting these experiments is the complex geometry presented by highly twinned materials .",
    "here we consider the simpler case of a c - axis ybco - pb tunnel junction in which the ybco has only one twin boundary in the junction .",
    "experimental efforts on this system are currently underway@xcite .    in the idealized geometry",
    "we describe below ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the pb / ybco junction which contains a single twin boundary can be described as a `` @xmath6 '' junction , where the pair transfer integral has a relative pair phase of @xmath3 in the left part of the junction ( length @xmath16 ) and @xmath4 in the right part of the junction ( length @xmath17 ) .",
    "here we are interested in understanding the behavior of such `` @xmath18 '' josephson junctions .",
    "while we describe our geometry in terms of c - axis tunneling in ybco - pb junctions , our results apply equally well to the @xmath6 a - b plane ybco - pb planar junctions@xcite and grain boundary junctions@xcite used for phase sensitive tests of the symmetry of the high-@xmath19 superconductors .",
    "in particular , while traditionally one considers the magnetic interference pattern , we will also be interested in spontaneous flux , flux generated by the self - screening josephson currents in the absence of a drive current and an external field @xmath20 , which can be directly probed by , for example , a scanning squid microscope@xcite . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two measurements are complementary , since while the magnetic field interference patterns are only strikingly different between a @xmath6 junction and a conventional @xmath21 junction in the short junction limit @xmath22 , appreciable spontaneous flux only appears in the @xmath6 junction in the long junction limit @xmath23 .    the maximum josephson current @xmath24 which a junction can carry versus an external magnetic field @xmath20 applied parallel to the plane of the junction",
    "is called the `` magnetic interference pattern '' . the interference pattern for a short ( @xmath25 ) @xmath0 junction has been discussed by wollman",
    "_ et al._@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite have estimated the crossover to the limiting case of a long ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 junction . with the approximations made by xu _",
    "_ , the magnetically modulated critical current of a long @xmath0 junction is basically identical to the conventional @xmath21 junction due to entrance of a half - flux quantum vortex , and the solution which contains spontaneously generated flux ceases to be a global minimum of the free energy for short junctions .",
    "our exact numerical solutions , however , show that there is still a `` dip '' in the center of the diffraction patterns even for junctions as long as @xmath28 , and that the symmetric junction should contain spontaneously generated magnetic flux even for @xmath29 . here",
    "we are primarily interested in determining the behavior of a @xmath6 junction for intermediate values of @xmath30 and different @xmath31 asymmetries .",
    "we believe that the dependence on @xmath32 of both the field - modulated critical current and the spontaneous flux generation of a pb - ybco junction with one twin boundary can provide important information on the @xmath5-axis coupling .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss a numerical method for calculating the spontaneous flux generation and magnetic interference patterns for arbitrary junction lengths @xmath30 and junction asymmetries @xmath31 .",
    "we then compare results for the critical current @xmath33 versus external magnetic field @xmath20 for the case of a traditional @xmath21 junction with the symmetric @xmath6 case as a function of the reduced junction length @xmath32 . following this , we focus on the josephson screening currents by examining the flux generated by these self - currents in the absence of an external current and magnetic field .",
    "as previously noted , this self generated flux can be probed using a scanning squid microscope@xcite , providing important information on the nature of the c - axis josephson coupling .",
    "we then turn to the interesting case in which the areas of the two twin regions differ and again look at the self - flux versus @xmath32 .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between the results for the spontaneous flux generation which occurs in asymmetric junctions compared to symmetric junctions .",
    "we show briefly how these results can be extended to a junction with multiple twin boundaries .",
    "we conclude by discussing what this type of experiment can tell us about the pb - ybco c - axis josephson tunneling .",
    "the geometry and gap structure which we envision is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in this idealized geometry@xcite , the upper ybco strip contains a twin boundary which separates the ybco - pb junction into two regions . as schematically",
    "illustrated in fig . 1 , we have taken the phase of the larger lobe of the @xmath14 gap in region @xmath34 to be positive .",
    "then , if the phase is locked across the grain boundary as one expects@xcite , the larger lobe in region @xmath35 will be negative .",
    "thus the pair transfer integral between the ybco and the pb leads to a relative josephson pair phase of 0 for @xmath36 and @xmath4 for @xmath35 .",
    "following the notation of owen and scalapino@xcite , we describe a junction ( fig .",
    "1 ) with width w small compared to @xmath2 in the @xmath37-direction , of length @xmath1 in the @xmath38-direction , carrying a total current @xmath39 in the @xmath38-direction , in an external magnetic field @xmath20 oriented in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "we include the effects of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 junctions by introducing an extra phase angle @xmath40 which takes the value @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the superconducting phase difference across the junction is then just the solution of the sine - gordon equation : @xmath41 applying ampere s law with a contour of integration around the perimeter of the junction in the @xmath42 plane leads to the boundary condition @xmath43 contours of integration in the @xmath44 plane circling the leads at @xmath45 and @xmath46 lead to @xmath47 the josephson penetration depth is given by @xmath48 where @xmath10 is the sum of the pb and ybco @xmath49 penetration depths plus the thickness of the insulator layer between the two superconductors , and @xmath50 is the josephson critical current density .",
    "the current per unit length through the junction is given by : @xmath51 the gradient of the phase is in turn related to the field @xmath52 in the junction by : @xmath53 if we redefine the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath39 as @xmath55 and @xmath56 the boundary conditions become @xmath57 @xmath58 defining a dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath59 the differential equation turns into a difference equation on a grid of size @xmath60 : @xmath61 the boundary conditions are then described as difference equations , where @xmath62 is the total number of junctions : @xmath63 @xmath64 these coupled difference equations are solved using a relaxation method to find the solution @xmath65 .",
    "the free energy of this solution is given by : @xmath66 written as a difference equation , the free energy for the vortex solution becomes : @xmath67 while the free energy of the no - vortex ( @xmath68 everywhere ) solution is : @xmath69 to obtain the critical current , the current @xmath39 through the junction is increased in steps , iterating the solution until either the convergence criterion    @xmath70    @xmath71 / n_{j }   \\ } ^ { 1/2 } / \\pi\\ ] ]    is satisfied , with @xmath72 normally chosen to be @xmath73 , or until the solution diverges with @xmath74 .",
    "for particular values of the parameters , we compare solutions with @xmath72 taken to be @xmath73 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 to check the convergence of the solution . the largest value of @xmath39 for which the iterations converge is taken to be the critical current @xmath33 . for the numerical calculations shown in the next section",
    ", we took @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , which meant that the dimensionless coupling constant ranged from @xmath80 for @xmath81 to @xmath82 for @xmath83 : @xmath60 was always much smaller than @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath84 .",
    "fig . 2 compares our results for the magnetic interference pattern for a @xmath21 junction ( a ) and a symmetric @xmath6 junction ( b ) for various values of the reduced length @xmath32 .",
    "here we have plotted @xmath85 versus @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the superconducting flux quantum . in the short junction limit",
    "@xmath25 , the critical current can be written as : @xmath90 where @xmath40 can be @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and the maximum value of the expression is obtained by varying @xmath91 for each value of @xmath20 . for the @xmath21 junction ( @xmath92 ) this expression reduces to : @xmath93 while for the symmetric @xmath6 junction ( @xmath94 ) this becomes : @xmath95 these equations are plotted as the solid lines in figure 2 . also included in figure 2a is the result of owen and scalapino for the reduced length @xmath96 . for the @xmath21 junction",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath1 is to reduce the height of the central peak in the magnetic interference pattern , and to reduce the amplitude of the successive oscillations as @xmath20 is increased . for the @xmath18 junction ,",
    "increasing @xmath1 tends to reduce the depth of the minimum at @xmath97 , and as @xmath98 the curves for the @xmath21 junction and the @xmath18 junction become identical as discussed by xu _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "however , even for @xmath96 , we find , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , that the critical current initially increases with flux until @xmath99 .",
    "this differs from the @xmath100 result shown in ref .",
    "we believe that this difference results from the approximation made by xu _",
    "_ that the presence of a @xmath4 vortex simply changes the phase in the @xmath4 section of the junction by @xmath4 , effectively changing it into a @xmath3-junction .",
    "this approximation is valid on length scales large compared to @xmath84 , but , as shown in fig .",
    "2b , leads to an experimentally detectable difference in the solutions even for @xmath1 as long as @xmath28 . for short and medium length junctions , xu _",
    "_ took the analytical long - junction expression and made the approximation that the effect of shortening the junction would be simply to cut off this expression .",
    "however , this is not a valid solution of the modified sine - gordon equation and the boundary conditions .",
    "it also leads , as we show below , to dramatic differences in both the free energy and the total flux for the @xmath4-vortex solutions for short- to medium - length junctions .",
    "3 addresses the question of spontaneous flux generation in @xmath18 junctions as a function of reduced length @xmath101 and the degree of asymmetry ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "3a plots the ratio of the free energy of the state with some spontaneous flux to the state with no flux .",
    "the dashed line is the result of xu _ et al .",
    "_ , using the approximation outlined above .",
    "the solid lines are our full results .",
    "note that , in contrast to the results of xu _ et al . _",
    ", for the symmetric @xmath6 junction ( @xmath103 ) the state with spontaneous flux always has lower energy than the state with no flux , and thus some self generated flux should therefore be present for all values of @xmath101 .",
    "fig 3b plots the spontaneous flux _ vs. _ @xmath104 .",
    "the inset in this figure shows that the spontaneous flux for a symmetric junction follows a power law dependence on junction length for short junctions . in this limit",
    "the phase @xmath105 has only small deviations from an average value of @xmath106 , and the spontaneously generated field increases linearly towards the center of the junction from a value of zero at the edges .",
    "a simple geometrical argument , expanding the sine - gordon equation about @xmath107 , implies that for short junctions the spontaneous flux should be given by @xmath108 .",
    "this relation is plotted as a straight line in the inset of fig .",
    "3b . however , for the asymmetric case , the state with no flux has the lowest free energy for short junctions , and as shown in fig .",
    "3b , there is no spontaneously generated flux , up to a critical value of @xmath109 .",
    "the amount of spontaneously generated flux approaches @xmath110 as @xmath17 gets larger , and rate of increase of flux at the onset of flux generation increases for less symmetrical junctions .",
    "the onset of spontaneous flux generation is also apparent in the magnetic interference patterns , as shown in fig .",
    "we hold the asymmetry factor @xmath102 fixed at 0.25 , and vary the length of the junction @xmath111 .",
    "for small @xmath111 there is no spontaneous flux generated , and the magnetic interference has a minimum at zero field .",
    "however , as @xmath112 approaches unity , there is an abrupt shift to a magnetic interference pattern with a maximum at zero field . the solid line in fig .",
    "4 is the short - junction limit calculated from eq .",
    "3.1 , which is a good indicator of the actual interference pattern only until flux generation becomes energetically favorable .",
    "the behavior of junctions with multiple twin boundaries can be calculated using the same techniques , as long as the junction width w is small compared to @xmath84 .",
    "we show the results of one such set of calculations in fig .",
    "we have assumed that there are 100 twins in the junction , with the probability of a particular twin having @xmath113 or @xmath114phase randomly distributed with the probability of @xmath4 being 0.25 .",
    "the circles in fig .",
    "5a show the randomly distributed set of @xmath113 and @xmath4 phases used in this calculation .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "5a show the solution for the phase angle @xmath105 at @xmath97 and @xmath115 , for various values of @xmath116 .",
    "these curves show , as expected , that the gradient of @xmath105 , and therefore the flux penetration into the junction , is spread throughout the junction for small @xmath116 , but is localised at the junction edges for @xmath117 . the solid line in fig .",
    "5b shows the predicted interference pattern from eq .",
    "3.1 in the short - junction limit .",
    "the other symbols show the result of the full numerical solution for @xmath118 and @xmath119 . even for this small number of randomly distributed twins , the interference pattern , although reduced in critical current , is similar to that for a single @xmath3-junction ( fig .",
    "2a ) especially for larger values of @xmath120 .",
    "this figure shows how important it is that complete knowledge of the distribution of twins be available for the correct interpretation of experimental work on @xmath5-axis tunneling from twinned samples .",
    "as discussed by sun _",
    "et al._@xcite , the results of their pb - ybco @xmath5-axis josephson tunneling experiments can be interpreted as showing that the order parameter in ybco must have some @xmath15-wave component . while this could be consistent with an order parameter having @xmath121 symmetry in an orthorhombic material , the interpretation of the experiments done on twinned materials depend on details of the multi - twinned geometry .",
    "here we have analyzed a simpler situation involving a single twin boundary . in this case , if the @xmath8 contribution is dominant , giving the type of order parameters illustrated in fig . 1",
    ", one should observe the behavior we have discussed . in particular , if the junction areas for the two twin regions are equal , one has the conventional minimum in the critical current at zero magnetic field as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , if @xmath120 is sufficiently small , and provided the current density is uniform on a scale set by @xmath84 . for the asymmetric case in which",
    "the areas of the two twin regions differ , more striking behavior should appear .",
    "there should be a sudden shift of the interference pattern from one with a minimum at zero field , to one with a maximum ( fig .",
    "4 ) , as @xmath112 goes through unity .",
    "one way to vary @xmath122 would be by changing @xmath123 with temperature .",
    "another would be to apply a magnetic field @xmath124 to vary @xmath125^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . alternatively , or in addition",
    ", one could use a scanning squid microscope to measure the spontaneous flux generated by the self - screening josephson currents . for the case of equal areas ,",
    "this spontaneous flux rises continuously as @xmath112 increases .",
    "however , for nonequal areas one finds no spontaneous flux generation below a critical value of @xmath128 and then a sharp increase in flux should occur .",
    "we believe that if these types of behavior are observed , they would show that the pb - ybco @xmath5-axis josephson coupling is consistent with a description of the high @xmath129 superconductors as having dominant @xmath8 symmetry .",
