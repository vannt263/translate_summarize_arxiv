    "over the past three decades the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been surprisingly successful . although the precision of the experimental tests improved by orders of magnitude no significant deviation from the sm predictions has been observed besides the compelling evidence for non  zero neutrino masses .",
    "still , there are many questions which the standard model does not answer and problems it can not solve . among the most important ones are the origin of the electro - weak symmetry breaking , hierarchy of scales , unification of fundamental forces and the nature of gravity .",
    "precise measurements of physics at highest @xmath0 and @xmath1 values should finally help us to solve the puzzles of the standard model .",
    "the discovery of the higgs particle and the measurement of its properties is the most important challenge of future experiments .",
    "however , the signs of `` new physics '' can be also looked for in many other channels .    in this paper",
    "we will report on the status of the experimental standard model tests , including searches for top physics and searches for the sm higgs boson .",
    "searches for supersymmetry , low - scale gravity , leptoquarks and other new phenomena beyond the standard model , are reviewed . finally , the prospects for discovering `` new physics '' at existing and future colliders are discussed .",
    "over the last decade the electroweak physics has entered the era of precision measurements , resulting in experimental accuracies better than the per mille level  @xcite : examples are the w - boson mass , measured at lep and the tevatron , and the effective weak mixing angle at the z  resonance , measured by sld and at lep .",
    "the comparison of electroweak precision measurements with accurate theory predictions allows to test the electroweak theory at the quantum level , where all parameters of the model enter . in this way it has been possible to obtain indirect constraints on the top - quark mass prior to the top - quark discovery , which turned out to be in remarkable agreement with the direct observation carried out at the tevatron . with the knowledge of the top - quark mass and further improved experimental and theoretical precisions , it is now possible to obtain constraints on the higgs boson mass within the standard model , which enters the precision observables in leading order only logarithmically in contrast to the quadratic dependence on the top quark mass .    as an example for the comparison between theory and experiment , fig .",
    "[ fig : mwtheoexp ] shows the currently most accurate prediction for the w - boson mass within the standard model  @xcite , derived from the prediction for muon decay , in comparison with the current experimental value for @xmath4 and the experimental exclusion limit on the higgs - boson mass , @xmath5  gev at 95% c.l .. the theory uncertainty is dominated by the experimental error of the top - quark mass , which enters the theory prediction as input parameter , while the present uncertainty from unknown higher - order corrections is smaller by about a factor 5  @xcite .",
    "the figure clearly shows the preference for a light higgs boson within the standard model ; at the @xmath6 level there is no overlap between the allowed regions of experimental result and theory prediction for @xmath5  gev .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] displays the experimental values from lep and the tevatron and the world average obtained from combining these two measurements , as well as indirect predictions from a standard model fit to the lep1+sld data and the lep1+sld data supplemented by the @xmath7 measurement .",
    "furthermore shown is the prediction within the standard model corresponding to the measurement from the nutev collaboration , which has recently published its final result on the ratio of neutral current to charged current reactions in neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "this measurement , when interpreted as a measurement of the mass of the w boson , shows an interesting deviation , at the level of three standard deviations , from the direct measurement .",
    "the nutev experiment has extracted the electroweak parameter , @xmath8 , from the high precision measurement of the ratio of neutral - current to charged - current cross sections in deep - inelastic neutrino and anti - neutrino scattering off a steel target .",
    "their measurement , @xmath9 , is @xmath10 above the standard model prediction .",
    "the plausibility of the hypothesis that this discrepancy is due to unaccounted qcd effects , especially a strange and anti - strange sea asymmetry has been evaluated by taking into account results from nutev , ccfr , and charged - lepton deep - inelastic cross section measurements .",

    "changing @xmath7 by 5  gev , corresponding to the present @xmath6 error , gives rise to a shift in the upper bound for @xmath13 of about 35% .    in the above fit results it has been assumed that the standard model provides the correct description of the data .",
    "a measure of how well the standard model describes the data is given by the fit probability .",
    "this probability is presently only 1.3% .",
    "it should be noted that the preference for a light higgs boson within the standard model is not induced by those observables which significantly deviate from the standard model prediction . omitting the nutev measurement from the fit leads to almost unchanged results for the fitted parameters , while the fit probability is improved to 11.4% . enlarging the errors of different measurements entering the effective weak mixing angle at the z resonance in order to take into account their spread by almost @xmath10 leads to a further significantly improved fit probability and a more pronounced tendency towards a light higgs boson .",

    "a variety of fitting techniques use information about the event kinematics .",
    "a one - to - one mapping between the observed leptons and jets and the fitted partons is assumed  @xcite .",
    "of course , it is assumed that the selected sample of events contains just the @xmath29 events and the sm background .",
    "this is the simplest and the most natural hypothesis since top quark is expected in the sm . on the other hand ,",
    "the samples of @xmath30 and single top candidates are among the best places to look for new physics . because of the top quark mass being large , event selection cuts in top analyses are practically identical to those applied in many analyses looking for physics beyond the sm ( supersymmetry , technicolor , leptoquarks , etc ) . both cdf and d0 made numerous comparisons between various distributions of the reconstructed top quarks , and especially those of the @xmath30-system , with the sm predictions .",
    "no significant disagreements were found .",
    "the increased integrated luminosity expected at the tevatron run ii ( about a factor of 20 in respect to run i ) , combined with improvements to cdf and d0 detectors and larger @xmath30 cross section , will allow the experiments to collect a number of reconstructed top events 2070 times larger than in run i , depending on the final state and tagging requirements .",
    "the systematic effects will dominate uncertainties in the measurements of @xmath31 and m@xmath32 .",
    "both experiments estimate that the error on m@xmath32 will reach @xmath33= 23 gev / c@xmath15 ( compared with 7 gev / c@xmath15 in run i ) .",
    "the @xmath34 cross section should be measured with an error of about 8% ( about 30% in run i ) .",
    "analysis of single top production offers a direct access to the @xmath35 vertex and should allow the measurement of the @xmath36 element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix .",
    "anomalous couplings would lead to anomalous angular distributions and larger production rates .",
    "the expected sm cross sections are of the order of 12 pb .",
    "of course the increased statistics will allow the tevatron experiments to finally test the underlying hypothesis that the top candidate events are just the @xmath30 events and not events from new physics  @xcite .",
    "the higgs mechanism is one of the basic ingredients of the standard model theory of fundamental interactions , allowing the introduction of masses for the observed particles , without violating the local gauge invariance .",
    "still the higgs boson is probably the most elusive particle to be found . within the sm",
    "a single neutral scalar is predicted , whose mass is an arbitrary parameter , although unitarity of the model imposes an upper limit of about 1 tev .",
    "precision electroweak measurement indicate that the mass of the standard model higgs boson should be around 81 gev / c@xmath15 and the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit is set at 193 gev / c@xmath15 .",
    "the higgs boson has still to be found .",

    "the sm higgs boson is produced via higgs - strahlung or vector boson fusion and decays mainly into @xmath38 .",
    "the searches at lep are based on the following topologies : fully hadronic decay ( @xmath39 ) , decay of the z into @xmath40 and decays of the z into @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "the fully hadronic channel has the largest cross section and the possibility of detection is dominated by the b - tagging capabilities of the detectors .    the higgs search at the highest c.m .",

    "@xcite .    the quest for higgs will now move to the tevatron , where a new data taking phase started in march 2001 ( run ii )  @xcite . at the tevatron run ii",
    "the @xmath45 production mode dominates over all mass ranges , but the huge irreducible qcd background makes it impossible to use this production channel for a measurement .",
    "so , for low higgs mass ( @xmath13 @xmath46 130 gev / c@xmath15 ) the associated production with a vector boson ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) and the subsequent decay into @xmath38 is the most promising channel , with an estimated cross section production of order 0.1  pb .",
    "the double b - tagging of the 2 jets coming from the higgs decay , together with the signature of the additional boson helps to discriminate from the background . from the trigger point of view , channels with one high @xmath49 lepton coming from the vector boson decay are not a concern , since the rate can be easily controlled . on the other hand channel where the vector boson decays into quarks",
    "( w / z ) or neutrinos ( z ) have an higher branching ratios and trigger strategies need to be devised to control data taking rates .",
    "it has been shown in preliminary studies  @xcite that a trigger strategy based on the use of svt tracks is crucial in selecting a sample enriched in heavy flavors , keeping the rate at a reasonable level .",

    "have been installed but not yet commissioned . for further details see @xcite .    as mentioned before not only the degree of polarization is decisive but also the accuracy with which this polarization can be measured . for this purpose",
    "significant improvements of the longitudinal polarimeter ( lpol ) as well as the transversal polarimeter ( tpol ) have been made .",
    "the lpol needs only an energy measurement of the compton scattered photon , whereas the tpol needs to measure its vertical position in addition and measures then the up ",

    "ii upgrade the lpol is improved by a fabry  perot cavity in order to run in a few photon mode which allows for an improved analysis and leads to high statistics .",
    "the tpol on the other hand is upgraded in a two  fold way . in order to improve the angular resolution",
    "a silicon strip detector has been installed in front of the calorimeter which allows a continous position calibration during the measurement . furthermore , due to a new data acquisition",
    "a bunch to bunch measurement will be possible so that altogether an accuracy of @xmath113 can be reached .",

    "also other regions of physics beyond the standard model , comparable to the reachable regions at tevatron ii , are open at the run hera ii .",
    "in particular for the search for scalar leptoquarks the search can be increased up to a mass scale of about @xmath116  gev .",
    "but also in the search for r - parity violating msugra the limits for large @xmath61 parameters are competitive to the other experiments .",
    "very interesting channels are those of excited leptons , in particular neutrinos . for low masses",
    "@xmath117  gev hera ii will be unique to discover this physics beyond the standard model . for higher masses the delphi results will overtake .",
    "concluding one can state that after the detector commissioning the hera ii upgrade is complete and has real chance of discovering new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the use of polarized beams will provide an important tool .",
    "the run i data taking period at the tevatron ended in february 1996 . since then the collider and both the detectors ( cdf and d0 ) underwent substantial upgrades .",
    "the energy of the beams has been increased from 900 gev to 980 gev . a new synchrotron ( `` main injector '' ) has been built in a new tunnel .",
    "the main injector together with a debuncher - accumulator - recycler complex allows for faster production of antiprotons and the possibility of reusing them after they are rescued in the recycler . in run",
    "i the luminosity reached 1.5@xmath11810@xmath119@xmath120sec@xmath19 and was obtained with a 6 on 6 proton - antiproton bunches in the collider with an interbunch time of 3.5  @xmath121sec .",

    "we have already mention that the quest for higgs will be the main topic of research at the tevatron in the next several years .    for top physics",
    "an extra 30 - 35% in the cross section is gained ( 1.8 to 2  tev ) .",
    "there will also be a gain from acceptance and efficiency : 100  pb@xmath19 in run ii is equivalent to 150 - 300  pb@xmath19 in run i ) . at this time work",
