    "the source grs 1758258 was discovered in the hard x  ray / soft @xmath3ray energy range with the sigma / granat coded mask telescope ( sunyaev et al .",
    "grs 1758258 is of particular interest since , together with the more famous source 1e 1740.7 2942 , it is the only persistent hard x",
    " ray emitter ( @xmath0 kev ) in the vicinity of the galactic center ( goldwurm et al .",
    "both sources have peculiar radio counterparts with relativistic jets ( mirabel et al . 1992a",
    "; rodriguez , mirabel & mart 1992 ; mirabel 1994 ) and might be related to the 511 kev line observed from the galactic center direction ( bouchet et al .",
    "1991 ) . despite the precise localization obtained at radio wavelengths ,",
    "an optical counterpart of grs 1758258 has not been identified ( mereghetti et al . 1992 ; mereghetti , belloni & goldwurm 1994a ) .",
    "simultaneous rosat and sigma observations , obtained in the spring of 1993 , indicated the presence of a soft excess ( mereghetti , belloni & goldwurm 1994b ) .",
    "this spectral component ( @xmath4 kev ) was weaker in 1990 , when the hard x  ray flux ( @xmath5 kev ) was in its highest observed state . on the basis of its hard x  ray spectrum , grs 1758258",
    "is generally considered a black hole candidate ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; stella et al .",
    "the possible evidence for a soft spectral component anticorrelated with the intensity of the hard ( @xmath6 kev ) emission supports this interpretation .",
    "no detailed studies of grs 1758258 in the `` classical '' x  ray range have been performed so far . here",
    "we report the first observations of this source obtained with an imaging instrument in the @xmath7 kev energy range .",
    "the observation of grs 1758258 took place between 1995 march 29 22:39 ut and march 30 15:38 ut . the asca satellite ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) provides simultaneuos data in four coaligned telescopes , equipped with two solid state detectors ( sis0 and sis1 ) and two gas scintillation proportional counters ( gis2 and gis3 ) .",
    "we applied stringent screening criteria to reject periods of high background , and eliminated all the time intervals with the bright earth within 40 degrees of the pointing direction for the sis data ( 10 degrees for the gis ) , resulting in the net exposure times given in table 1 .     &",
    "exposure time ( s)&count rate ( counts / s ) + sis0&9,471&5.310@xmath80.024 + sis1&9,455&4.220@xmath80.022 + gis2&12,717&4.507@xmath80.022 + gis3&11,949&5.155@xmath80.025 +      figure 1 shows the image obtained with the gis2 detector .",
    "most of the detector area is covered by stray light due to the bright source gx51 , located outside the field of view , at an off  axis angle of about 40 arcmin .",
    "fortunately , grs 1758258 lies in a relatively unaffected region of the detector , which allows us to estimate the contamination from gx51 as explained below .",
    "the source counts were extracted from a circle of 6 arcmin radius centered at the position of grs 1758258 , and rebinned in order to have a minimum of 25 counts in each energy channel . due to the present uncertainties in the asca response at low energies , we only considered photons in the 0.810 kev range .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from the corresponding regions of observations of empty fields provided by the asca guest observer facility .",
    "the contribution to the background due to gx51 is mostly concentrated in a circular segment with area @xmath936 arcmin2 indicated with a in figure 1 .",
    "its spectrum was estimated by the difference of regions a and b , and added to the background .",
    "a similar procedure was followed to extract the gis3 net spectrum .",
    "using xspec ( version 9.0 ) we explored several spectral models by simultaneously fitting the data sets of both gis instruments .",
    "the best fit was obtained with a power law with photon index @xmath10 and column density @xmath11 cm@xmath2 ( reduced @xmath13 for 372 d.o.f . , errors at 90% confidence intervals for a single interesting parameter ) .",
    "other models based on a single spectral component ( e.g. blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung ) gave unacceptable results , with the exception of the comptonized disk model of sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) .",
    "however , the limited energy range of the asca data alone , does not allow in the latter case to pose interesting constraints on the fit parameters .",
    "the gis instruments have a time resolution of 0.5 s or 62.5 ms , according to the available telemetry rate .",
    "most of our data had the higher time resolution . using a fourier transform technique , and after correction of the times of arrivals to the solar system barycenter",
    ", we performed a search for periodicities .",
    "no coherent pulsations in the 0.1251000 s period range were found .",
    "for the hypothesis of a sinusoidal modulation we can set an upper limit of @xmath95% to the pulsed fraction .",
    "both sis instruments were operated in the single chip mode , which gives a time resolution of 4 s and images of a square 11x11 arcmin2 region ( figure 2 ) .",
    "most of the sis data ( 83% ) were acquired in `` faint mode '' and then converted to `` bright '' .",
    "this allows to minimize the errors due to the echo effects in the analog electronics and to the uncertainties in the dark frame value ( otani & dotani , 1994 ) .",
    "the inclusion of the data directly acquired in bright mode resulted in spectra of lower quality ( significant residuals in the 23 kev region ) .",
    "we therefore concentrated the spectral analysis on the faint mode data . the source counts ( 0.610 kev ) were extracted from circles with a radius of 3 arcmin , and the resulting energy spectra ( 1024 pi energy channels ) rebinned in order to have at least 25 counts in each bin .",
    "we subtracted a background spectrum derived during our observation from an apparently source free region of the ccds ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this background is higher than that obtained from the standard observations of empty fields , probably due to the contamination from gx51 .",
    "it contributes @xmath94% of the extracted counts .",
    "we verified that the derived spectral parameters do not change significantly if we use the blank sky background file , or even if we completely neglect the background subtraction . by fitting together the data from the two sis we obtained results similar to those derived with the gis instruments .",
    "in particular , a power law spectrum gives photon index @xmath14 and @xmath15 cm@xmath2 , with a reduced @xmath16 of 1.031 ( 872 d.o.f . ) .",
    "no prominent emission lines are visible in the spectrum of grs 1758258 ( as already mentioned , some features in the region around 2 kev are probably due to instrumental problems , they appear stronger when the bright mode data and the corresponding response matrix are used ) .",
    "upper limits on the possible presence of an iron line were computed by adding a gaussian line centered at 6.4 kev to the best fit power law model and varying its parameters ( intensity and width ) until an unacceptable increase in the c2 was obtained .",
    "the 95% upper limit on the equivalent width is @xmath950 ev for a line width of @xmath17 kev and increases for wider lines ( up to @xmath9110 ev for @xmath18 kev ) .",
    "also in the case of the sis , a search for periodicities ( limited to period greater than 8 s ) resulted only in upper limits similar to the gis ones .",
    "the soft x  ray flux observed with rosat in 1993 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "1994b ) was higher than that expected from the extrapolation of the quasi  simultaneous sigma measurement ( @xmath5 kev ) , indicating the presence of a soft spectral component with power law photon index @xmath93 below @xmath92 kev .",
    "clearly , such a steep , low  energy component is not visible in the present asca data , which are well described by a single flat power law .",
    "the corresponding flux of @xmath19 ergs cm@xmath2 s@xmath20 ( in the 110 kev band , corrected for the absorption ) is within the range of values measured in march ",
    "april 1990 ( sunyaev et al . 1991 ) , when the source was in its highest observed state .",
    "this fact is consistent with the presence of a prominent soft component only when the hard x  ray flux is at a lower intensity level .",
    "though a single power law provides an acceptable fit to the asca data , we also explored spectral models consisting of two different components : a soft thermal emission plus a hard tail .",
    "for instance , with a blackbody plus power law , we obtained a good fit to both the sis and gis data with @xmath21 kev and photon index @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "obviously such a power law must steepen at higher energy to be consistent with the sigma observations .",
    "in fact a sunyaev  titarchuk comptonization model can equally well fit the asca hard tail and provide an adequate spectral steepening to match the high energy data ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "good results were also obtained when the soft thermal component was fitted with models of emission from accretion disks ( e.g. makishima et al .",
    "1986 , stella & rosner 1984 ) . in all cases",
    "the total flux in the soft component amounts only to a few percent of the overall ( 0.1 300 kev ) luminosity .",
    "however , the low observed flux , coupled to the high accretion rates required by the fitted temperatures , implies an unplausible large distance for grs 1758258 and/or very high inclination angles ( note that there is no evidence so far of eclipses or periodic absorption dips which could hint to a high inclination system ) . a possible alternative solution is to invoke a significant dilution of the optically thick soft component by comptonization in a hot corona .",
    "a very rough estimate shows that , in order to effectively remove photons from the thermal distribution , a scattering opacity of @xmath24 is required .",
    "our asca observation provides the most accurate measurement of the absorption toward grs 1758258 obtained so far .",
    "obviously the derived value is slightly dependent on the adopted spectral model .",
    "however , values within at most 10% of @xmath25 cm@xmath2 were obtained for all the models ( one or two components ) fitting the data .",
    "this column density is consistent with a distance of the order of the galactic center and similar to that of other sources in the galactic bulge ( kawai et al .",
    "1988 ) , but definitely smaller than that observed with asca in 1e 1740.72942 ( churazov et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the information on the galactic column density , coupled to the optical / ir data , can yield some constraints on the possible companion star of grs 1758258 ( see chen , gehrels & leventhal 1994 ) . a candidate counterpart with @xmath2619 and @xmath2717 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "1994a ) lies within @xmath92 `` of the best radio position ( mirabel et al .",
    "other infrared sources present in the x  ray error circle ( 10 '' radius ) are fainter than @xmath28 ( mirabel & duc 1992 ) . using an average relation between @xmath29 and optical reddening ( gorenstein 1975 )",
    ", we estimate a value of @xmath30 , corresponding to less than one magnitude of absorption in the k band ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "thus , for a distance of the order of 10 kpc , the k band absolute magnitude must be fainter than @xmath31 .",
    "this limit clearly rules out supergiant or giant companion stars , as well as main sequence stars earlier than type a ( johnson 1966 ) , thus excluding the possibility that grs 1758258 is in a high mass binary system .",
    "the flux of grs 1758258 measured with the sis instruments corresponds to a 110 kev luminosity of @xmath32 ergs s@xmath20 ( for a distance of 10 kpc ) .",
    "a reanalysis of archival data from ttm / mir , xrt / spacelab2 and exosat ( skinner 1991 ) , showed that grs 1758258 had a similar intensity also in 1985 and in 1989 .",
    "an earlier discovery had been prevented only by confusion problems with gx51 , much brighter than grs 1758 258 below @xmath920 kev .",
    "subsequent hard x  ray observations with sigma ( gilfanov et al . 1993 , goldwurm et al . 1994 ) repeatedly detected grs 1758258 with a hard spectrum extending up to @xmath9300 kev .",
    "it is therefore clear that grs 1758258 , though variable by a factor of @xmath910 on a timescale of months , is not a transient source .",
    "the asca satellite has provided the first detailed data on grs 1758258 in the 110 kev region , allowing to minimize the confusion problems caused by the vicinity of gx51 , that affected previous observations with non imaging instruments .    the possible black hole nature of grs 1758258 , inferred from the high energy data ( sunyaev et al .",
    "1991 , goldwurm et al .",
    "1994 ) , is supported by the asca results .",
    "the power law spectrum , extending up to the hard x  ray domain is similar to that of cyg x1 and other black hole candidates in their low ( or hard ) state .",
    "furthermore , our stringent limits on the presence of periodic pulsations and accurate measurement of interstellar absorption make the possibility of a neutron star accreting from a massive companion very unlikely .",
    "the lack of iron emission lines in the sis data has to be confirmed by more stringent upper limits to rule out , e.g. , the presence of a reflection component as proposed for cyg x1 ( done et al .",
    "1992 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the iron line recently observed with asca in cyg x 1 has an equivalent width of only 1030 ev ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the prominent soft excess observed with rosat in 1993 , when the hard x  ray flux was in a lower intensity state , was absent during our observation .",
    "the source was in a hard spectral state , with a possible soft component accounting for @xmath95% of the total luminosity at most . a similar soft component ( @xmath33 kev ) , but contributing a larger fraction of the flux , has been observed in cyg x1 and attributed to emission from the accretion disk ( balucinska  church et al .",
    "if the soft component in grs 1758258 originates from the disk , strong dilution is required .",
    "an optically thick hot cloud embedding the innermost part of the disk is an attractive hypothesis . to test the viability of this model , a detailed fit to simultaneous data over a broad energy range , as available , e.g. , with sax in the near future ,",
    "is required ."
