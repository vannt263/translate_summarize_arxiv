    "cluster algebras were invented by s.  fomin and a.  zelevinsky @xcite in the spring of the year 2000 in a project whose aim it was to develop a combinatorial approach to the results obtained by g.  lusztig concerning total positivity in algebraic groups @xcite on the one hand and canonical bases in quantum groups @xcite on the other hand ( let us stress that canonical bases were discovered independently and simultaneously by m.  kashiwara @xcite ) . despite great progress during the last few years @xcite @xcite @xcite , we are still relatively far from these initial aims .",
    "presently , the best results on the link between cluster algebras and canonical bases are probably those of c.  geiss , b.  leclerc and j.  schrer @xcite @xcite @xcite but even they can not construct canonical bases from cluster variables for the moment . despite these difficulties ,",
    "the theory of cluster algebras has witnessed spectacular growth thanks notably to the many links that have been discovered with a wide range of subjects including    * poisson geometry @xcite @xcite  , * integrable systems @xcite  , * higher teichmller spaces @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  , * combinatorics and the study of combinatorial polyhedra like the stasheff associahedra @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  , * commutative and non commutative algebraic geometry , in particular the study of stability conditions in the sense of bridgeland @xcite @xcite , calabi - yau algebras @xcite , donaldson - thomas invariants @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite  , * and last not least the representation theory of quivers and finite - dimensional algebras , cf . for example the surveys @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "we refer to the introductory papers @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and to the cluster algebras portal @xcite for more information on cluster algebras and their links with other parts of mathematics .",
    "the link between cluster algebras and quiver representations follows the spirit of categorification : one tries to interpret cluster algebras as combinatorial ( perhaps @xmath0-theoretic ) invariants associated with categories of representations .",
    "thanks to the rich structure of these categories , one can then hope to prove results on cluster algebras which seem beyond the scope of the purely combinatorial methods .",
    "it turns out that the link becomes especially beautiful if we use a _ triangulated category _",
    "constructed from the category of quiver representations , the so - called cluster category .    in this brief survey , we will review the definition of cluster algebras and fomin - zelevinsky s classification theorem for cluster - finite cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "we will then recall some basic notions on the representations of a quiver without oriented cycles , introduce the cluster category and describe its link with the cluster algebra .",
    "the cluster algebras we will be interested in are associated with antisymmetric matrices with integer coefficients . instead of using matrices , we will use quivers ( without loops and @xmath1-cycles ) , since they are easy to visualize and well - suited to our later purposes .      let us recall that a _ quiver _",

    "the phenomena observed in the above example are explained by the following key theorem :    let @xmath2 be a finite connected quiver without loops or @xmath1-cycles with vertex set @xmath16 .",

    "we refer to the books @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite for a wealth of information on the representation theory of quivers and finite - dimensional algebras . here",
    ", we will only need very basic notions .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite quiver without oriented cycles .",

    "v_1 \\ar[rr]_{v_{\\gamma } } \\ar[ru]^{v_\\alpha } & & v_3 } \\ ] ] formed by three finite - dimensional vector spaces and three linear maps .",
    "morphism of representations _ is a morphism of diagrams .",
    "we thus obtain the _ category of representations _ @xmath97 .",
    "notice that it is an abelian category ( since it is a category of diagrams in an abelian category , that of finite - dimensional vector spaces ) : sums , kernels and cokernels in the category @xmath97 are computed componentwise .",
    "we denote by @xmath98 its bounded derived category .",
    "thus , the objects of @xmath98 are the bounded complexes @xmath99 & v^p \\ar[r]^d & v^{p+1 } \\ar[r ] & \\ldots}\\ ] ] of representations and its morphisms are obtained from morphisms of complexes by formally inverting all quasi - isomorphisms ( = morphisms inducing isomorphisms in homology ) .",
    "the category @xmath98 is still an additive category ( direct sums are given by direct sums of complexes ) but it is almost never abelian . in fact , it is abelian if and only if @xmath2 does not have any arrows .",
    "but it is always _ triangulated_.",
    "this means that @xmath98 is additive and endowed with    * a _ suspension functor _ @xmath100 , namely the functor taking a complex @xmath101 to @xmath102 $ ] , where @xmath102^p = v^{p+1}$ ] for all @xmath103 and @xmath104}=-d_v$ ] ; * a class of _ triangles _ , namely the sequences @xmath105 & v \\ar[r ] & w \\ar[r ] & \\sigma u}\\ ] ] which are ` induced ' from short exact sequences of complexes .",
    "the triangulated category @xmath98 admits a _ serre functor _ , i.e. an autoequivalence @xmath106 which makes the serre duality formula true : we have @xmath107 bifunctorially in @xmath108 , @xmath109 belonging to @xmath98 , where @xmath110 denotes the duality functor @xmath111 over the ground field @xmath22 . the _ cluster category _ is defined as the _ orbit category _",
    "@xmath112 of @xmath98 under the action of the cyclic group generated by the automorphism @xmath113 .",
    "thus , its objects are the same as those of @xmath98 and its morphisms are defined by @xmath114 one can show @xcite that @xmath115 admits a structure of triangulated category such that the projection functor @xmath116 becomes a triangle functor ( in general , the orbit category of a triangulated category under the action of an automorphism group is no longer triangulated ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that the cluster category has finite - dimensional morphism spaces , and that it admits a serre functor induced by that of the derived category . the definition of the cluster category then immediately yields an isomorphism @xmath117 and this means that @xmath115 is @xmath1-calabi - yau : a @xmath22-linear triangulated category with finite - dimensional morphism spaces is @xmath118-calabi - yau if it admits a serre functor @xmath119 and if @xmath119 is isomorphic to @xmath120 ( the @xmath118th power of the suspension functor ) as a triangle functor .",
    "the definition of the cluster category is due to buan - marsh - reineke - reiten - todorov @xcite ( for arbitrary @xmath2 without oriented cycles ) and , independently and with a very different , more geometric description , to caldero - chapoton - schiffler @xcite ( for @xmath2 of type @xmath121 ) .    to state the close relationship between the cluster category @xmath115 and the cluster algebra @xmath72",

    "if @xmath122 and @xmath123 are rigid indecomposables such that the space @xmath134 is one - dimensional , then we have the generalized exchange relation @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the middle terms of ` the ' non split triangles @xmath138 & b \\ar[r ] & m \\ar[r ] & \\sigma l } \\mbox { and } \\xymatrix{m \\ar[r ] & b ' \\ar[r ] & l \\ar[r ] & \\sigma m}\\ ] ] and we define @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a decomposition into indecomposables .    the relation  ( [ eq : gen - exchange ] ) in part c ) of the theorem can be generalized to the case where the extension group is of higher dimension , cf .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one can show using @xcite that relation  ( [ eq : gen - exchange ] ) generalizes the exchange relation  ( [ eq : exchange ] ) which appeared in the definition of the mutation .",
