    "outer rings are located at the greatest distance from the galaxy center of any feature resonant with a bar . because of their great distance from the galaxy center",
    ", their morphology should be sensitive to the distribution of the dark matter in the galaxy . since they are resonant with the bar they are also sensitive to the mass - to - light ratio of the bar .",
    "these rings provide a unique opportunity to constrain the mass - to - light ratio of the luminous stellar matter in a galaxy , thus telling us about the dark matter distribution .",
    "although the morphology of outer rings has been used to constrain bar pattern speeds ( @xcite ) , it has not yet been used to constrain the dark matter distribution .",
    "disk mass - to - light ratios have been almost exclusively measured by axisymmetric fits to observed rotation curves ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and are commonly done by requiring the disk to be as massive as possible , as in the `` maximal disk '' model .",
    "disk mass - to - light ratios determined in this manner are model dependent ( see @xcite ) and are affected by a variety of assumptions such as the dark matter halo profile assumed and the bulge / disk decomposition method . in this paper , by measuring the gravitational force of a non - axisymmetric component , the bar , which is necessarily a disk component , we can constrain the disk mass - to - light ratio in a way that is independent of the radial distribution of the dark matter , and does not require the assumption ( of the `` maximal disk '' model ) that the disk is as massive as possible within the limits set by the rotation curve .    three classes of rings can be seen in normal barred galaxies .",
    "nuclear rings located inside the bar , inner rings which envelop the bar , and outer rings which surround the bar .",
    "the simulations of @xcite first demonstrated that outer rings develop in the ism near the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) of the bar .",
    "outer rings are classified ( following @xcite ) as r1-type or r2-type rings , where r2-type rings are oval and aligned parallel to the bar and r1-type rings resemble an oval with dimples at the points where the ring is closest to the bar . when the rings contain spiral structure , they are classified as pseudo - rings and are denoted r1@xmath4 or r2@xmath4 rings .",
    "the two types of rings have morphology closed related to the two families of closed orbits near the olr ( e. g. see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the bar in these galaxies causes many stellar orbits in the plane of the galaxy to intersect themselves . because gas can shock",
    ", it can not remain in these orbits , so it collects in orbits that are near the periodic orbit families which are not self - intersecting ( @xcite ) . for an excellent review on the properties of ringed galaxies",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the sensitivity of the ring shape of an r1@xmath4 ringed galaxy to the mass - to - light ratio of the bar .",
    "the non - axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential is derived from a @xmath5 band image of the galaxy .",
    "the morphology of the ring is compared to periodic orbits near the olr for different bar mass - to - light ratios . using this comparison we place limits on the mass - to - light ratio of the bar , and so on the distribution of the dark matter in the galaxy .",
    "ngc  6782 is the best example of an r1-type ringed galaxy found to date in the osu galaxy survey . in a catalog of southern ringed galaxies ( @xcite )",
    "the galaxy is classified as r1@xmath4sb(r)0/a .",
    "@xcite shows this galaxy as a nice example of an r1@xmath4 ringed galaxy and demonstrates that the outer ring is prominent in a @xmath6 color map and so is quite blue .",
    "@xcite show ngc  6782 as a example of a galaxy that resembles their slow pattern speed simulations .",
    "the r1@xmath4 ring in ngc  6782 has a radius of @xmath7 which corresponds to 15kpc assuming a distance to the galaxy of 50 mpc ( @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "the galaxy was observed in the near infrared @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands and in the visible @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands .",
    "these data are a preliminary part of a survey being carried out at the ohio state university of @xmath14 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the survey s goal is to produce a library of photometrically calibrated images of late - type galaxies from @xmath15 to @xmath16 m . for notes on the observation and reduction techniques",
    "see @xcite , or for individual examples @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all the images were observed at the cerro tololo interamerican observatories .",
    "the @xmath17 images were observed at the 0.9 m telescope on 1995 october 25 using the tek#2 @xmath18 pixel ccd with a spatial scale of @xmath19/pixel .",
    "total on source exposure times were 30 , 15 and 10 minutes for @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 images were observed at the 1.5 m telescope on 1995 october 31 and 1995 nov 2 using the nicmos 3 @xmath21 pixel infrared array with a spatial scale of @xmath22/pixel .",
    "total on source exposure times were 15 minutes at @xmath5 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 minutes at @xmath11 band .",
    "the infrared images were observed during photometric conditions and were calibrated on the ctio / cit system using standard stars listed by carter & meadows 1995 .",
    "the optical images were observed during clear but non - photometric conditions .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath25 and @xmath5 band images of the galaxy and an @xmath26 color map . in the @xmath25 band image ( figure 1a )",
    "the classic figure 8 shape of the r1-type ring can be seen .",
    "the ring has some spiral structure which causes the ring to be brighter on its north - east and south - west sides than on its north - west and south - east sides .",
    "this means that the ring does not have perfect mirror symmetry about its major axis .",
    "the pinches near the bar ends can be more clearly seen in the brighter north - east and south - west sides of the ring .",
    "to integrate orbits in the plane of the galaxy we require an estimate of the gravitational potential .",
    "we assume that the potential in the plane @xmath27 is a sum of two components , an axisymmetric one , @xmath28 , and a component @xmath29 proportional to @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the azimuthal angle in the plane of the galaxy and @xmath33 is the radius .",
    "we take the bar to be aligned along the axis with @xmath34",
    ".      the axisymmetric component of the potential should be consistent with the rotation curve of the galaxy at the location of the outer ring . at the location of the outer ring in ngc  6782",
    ", dark matter is expected to contribute to the rotation curve .",
    "we therefore could not use a potential derived solely from the light distribution as did @xcite & @xcite which were dynamical studies of bars in the central few kpc of galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , there is no published rotation curve for ngc  6782 .",
    "few ringed galaxies have measured rotation curves at large radii .",
    "however those few that have been observed , have rotation curves that are nearly flat . for example",
    ", the rotation curve of eso-509 - 98 is very flat ( @xcite ) , and the hi velocity field shows the rotation curve of ngc  3351 ( of similar morphological type ) to be nearly flat ( a. bosma private communication ) .",
    "simulations of outer rings produce more realistic shaped rings in model galaxies with flat rotation curves ( @xcite ) . in our orbit integrations , for the axisymmetric component of the potential , @xmath35 , we therefore assume a logarithmic form consistent with a flat rotation curve .",
    "@xmath35 is determined by one parameter , the circular velocity , which we estimate from the tully - fisher relation ( see below ) .",
    "we include scaling factors in all values which depend upon this velocity so that when the actual circular velocity is known , these values can be corrected .",
    "near infrared images are superior to visible images for dynamical studies because of their reduced sensitivity to extinction from dust and because they are dominated by light from an older cooler stellar population that is more evenly distributed dynamically and a better tracer of the stellar mass in the galaxy than the bluer , hotter stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use the @xmath5 band image to determine the gravitational potential due to the luminous stellar component of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath5 band image was used because the sky is flatter outside the bar than it is in the @xmath23 band image and because it has higher signal to noise than the @xmath11 band image .",
    "the color @xmath36 is constant across the bar , though the bulge of the galaxy ( @xmath37 ) is redder with @xmath38 .",
    "the height of the rotation curve from the luminous stellar matter ( traced in @xmath5 band ) allows us to define a maximal disk , and show that at the ring a significant dark component is needed to have a realistic flat rotation curve .      before the gravitational potential due to luminous stellar matter",
    "can be generated from the infrared image , we must correct for the inclination of the galaxy . a statistical study of r1@xmath4 ringed galaxies found that these rings have observed axis ratios of @xmath39 and position angles on the sky with respect to the bar of @xmath40 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that r1@xmath4 rings are very nearly perpendicular to the bar and are elongated .",
    "gas simulations of these rings support @xcite s finding for the ring alignment ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore assume that the ring is perpendicular to the bar .",
    "this assumption reduces the degrees of freedom so that the major axis position angle is fixed by a choice for the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "another constraint on the galaxy inclination is obtained from the outermost detected isophotes .",
    "we constructed a sum of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 images weighted inversely by the noise in each band so as to maximize signal to noise in the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "an outer isophote is displayed in figure 1d .",
    "this isophote has major axis oriented at a position angle of @xmath41 and has an axis ratio of @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy is not highly inclined . since",
    "early - type galaxies are less often warped than late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) , it is unlikely that the galaxy is warped at large radii .",
    "we therefore corrected for the inclination , @xmath43 ( where a face - on galaxy has @xmath44 ) , of the galaxy using various inclinations and their accompanying position angles ( see table 1 ) .",
    "deprojected images of the galaxies at these inclinations are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the inclination @xmath0 causes the ring in the plane of the galaxy to be rounder or to have a larger axis ratio than for @xmath45 .",
    "inclinations higher than @xmath46 cause the outer isophotes of the galaxy ( see figure 1d ) to be very elliptical , or have an axis ratio smaller than @xmath47 ( see table 1 for axis ratios ) .",
    "these outer isophotes are not aligned with any feature in the galaxy so they should be close to circular .",
    "inclinations higher than @xmath46 also cause the ring to be either aligned parallel to the bar or to be almost round ( for @xmath48 , the ring axis ratio is @xmath49 ) . this would be inconsistent with the statistics of of r1@xmath4 rings compiled by @xcite . for inclinations lower than @xmath50 ,",
    "the bar and the ring can not be perpendicular .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the inclination of the galaxy is outside the range @xmath51 .    after correcting for inclination , the gravitational potential in the plane of the galaxy traced by the luminous stellar matter",
    "was determined by convolving the @xmath5 image of ngc  6782 with a function that depends on the vertical structure of the disk ( @xcite ) . before convolution stars were removed from the @xmath5 image .",
    "the disk is assumed to have density @xmath52 ( following @xcite ) where @xmath53 is the height above the plane of the galaxy and @xmath54 is the vertical scale height .",
    "the resulting potential is insensitive to the choice of vertical function for functions such as sech , sech@xmath55 and exponential with equivalent @xmath56 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the galaxy is distant , a small vertical scale height was used @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite found that doubling the vertical scale height results in raising the @xmath58 component of the gravitational potential by @xmath59 .",
    "we have deliberately made @xmath54 small because the seeing in the images causes artificial smoothing equivalent to increasing the size of @xmath54 .",
    "figure 3 shows the rotation curve derived from the axisymmetric component of the potential generated from the @xmath5 image for the different galaxy inclinations .",
    "the horizontal line shown in figure 3 is the circular rotational velocity computed using the tully - fisher relation . for an @xmath23 band total magnitude of @xmath60 measured from our @xmath23 band image , we compute a circular velocity of @xmath61 km s@xmath9 using the relation given in @xcite . all subsequent values given in this paper will be in units with respect to this circular velocity .",
    "this circular velocity is also what we used for the flat rotation curve axisymmetric component of the potential in our orbit integrations at the location of the ring .",
    "the rotation curves shown in figure 3 assume a distance of 50 mpc ( @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) to the galaxy and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath62 or using the color of the bar @xmath63 in solar units ( see @xcite ) where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the luminosities in the @xmath5 , and @xmath11 bands and @xmath66 is the true ( not yet measured ) circular velocity of the galaxy .    for a `` maximal disk ''",
    "the rotation curve is attributed as much as possible to be from the visible components so that the halo could have a hollow core .",
    "( some authors call a `` maximal disk solution '' one with a smooth halo that extends into the nucleus of the galaxy ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio listed above for the disk is what we take to give a `` maximal disk '' .",
    "this mass - to - light ratio was chosen so that the rotation curve generated from the @xmath5 band light reaches above the circular velocity predicted from the tully - fisher relation .",
    "once the true circular velocity for the galaxy has been observed , the mass - to - light ratio for the maximal disk can be rescaled . because the three dimensional nature of the bulge was not properly taken into account in estimating the potential , the rotation curve is higher ( by @xmath67 ) than it should be in the central @xmath68 .",
    "this is why we have chosen the mass - to - light ratio such that the rotation curve is somewhat higher than the circular velocity near the galaxy nucleus ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we note that the rotation curve generated from the light drops with increasing radius . at the radius of the ring ( @xmath69 or @xmath70kpc )",
    ", a significant fraction of the mass must be from dark matter .",
    "matter outside of our image which we do not detect exerts a radial force outwards , so that the rotation curve predicted from starlight should be even lower at large radii than we show in figure 3 .",
    "the non - axisymmetric component of the potential should be due solely to the bar of the galaxy .",
    "since the bar is in the disk of the galaxy , our inaccurate treatment of the bulge of the galaxy does not affect our measurement for @xmath29 ( defined in equation 1 ) .",
    "if luminous matter outside the image is axisymmetric then once again , our estimate for @xmath29 is not affected by neglecting this matter .",
    "this means that our orbit integrations which use only the @xmath58 component derived from the luminous matter are not affected by our inaccurate treatment of the bulge and outer disk .",
    "higher order fourier components of the potential are neglected since at the ring they are negligible .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath58 component measured from the potential due to luminous matter is shown in figure 4 for the various inclinations assumed and for the maximal disk mass - to - light ratio discussed above .",
    "the @xmath58 component drops off quickly with radius as expected for a quadrupolar potential term . also shown in figure 4 ,",
    "an exponential function @xmath71 was fit to these @xmath58 components .",
    "the numerical values for these fits are listed in table 1 .",
    "these numbers show the strength of the non - axisymmetric component of the potential from the bar for the maximal disk , ( corresponding to the rotation curves shown in figure 3 ) . for the higher inclinations @xmath58",
    "component is substantially stronger because the bar becomes longer once deprojected .",
    "the exponential scale length of @xmath58 , @xmath72 , is also larger for the higher inclination case ( see table 1 ) . in the next section",
    "we discuss the effect of changing the disk mass - to - light ratio ( and so the bar strength ) on the morphology of the r1@xmath4 ring .",
    "we integrate orbits in the plane of the galaxy for a gravitational potential with axisymmetric component consistent with a flat rotation curve and circular velocity determined from the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the non - axisymmetric component of the potential is derived from exponential fits to the @xmath58 components generated from the @xmath5 band image for the various galaxy inclinations assumed . in our integrations we vary the strength of the bar by adjusting the mass - to - light ratio of the @xmath5 band image and by keeping the circular velocity fixed .",
    "what we call the maximal disk corresponds to the mass - to - light ratios for the rotation curves shown in figure 3 and the @xmath58 components shown in figure 4 with fitting parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "varying the mass - to - light ratio of the disk corresponds to multiplying @xmath58 by a constant that is less than 1 .",
    "since the maximal disk mass - to - light ratio is determined by our assumption for the circular velocity ( see discussion above ) , our results are not affected by the fact that actual circular rotational velocity is not known .",
    "periodic orbits ( or orbits that are closed in the frame in which the bar is stationary ) in the plane of ngc  6782 were found by numerical integration as in @xcite .    in figure 5",
    "we show periodic orbits near the olr for the maximal disk for a galaxy inclination of @xmath73 .",
    "we see that the inner periodic orbits are more pinched near the bar , and have a rounder appearance .",
    "the outer orbits are more elongated and less pinched near the bar",
    ". points in figure 5 ( and subsequent figures ) are shown at equal timesteps along the orbit so that the gas density in the orbit should be high in the pinches near the bar .",
    "correspondingly the speed of the gas decreases in the pinches .",
    "measurement of the velocity field in the ring should constrain the degree of cuspiness of the orbits . as pointed out by @xcite the gas in the ring",
    "can not be in an orbit that intersects itself or that has loops .",
    "we therefore only consider orbits that are are not self - intersecting .",
    "for the orbits shown in figure 5a , the radius of corotation is @xmath74 and the bar angular rotation rate or pattern speed is @xmath75 gyr@xmath76 . for our rotation curve ,",
    "this pattern speed places the radius of corotation just past the end of the bar as predicted theoretically and inferred from observations of bars .",
    "figure 5 shows that the maximal disk provides a good fit to the morphology of the ring for a galaxy inclination of @xmath0 . in the following sections we explore the sensitivity of the ring morphology to the bar strength , the bar pattern speed and the galaxy inclination .",
    "figure 6 shows comparisons between periodic orbits with the same apogee for different bar strengths and pattern speeds at a galaxy inclination of @xmath0 .",
    "all figures compare an orbit shown in figure 5a that has a maximal disk mass - to - light ratio with a similar orbit for either lower bar mass - to - light ( figure 6a ) , faster bar ( figure 6b ) or both ( figure 6c ) .",
    "figure 6a shows the comparison for two bars with the same pattern speed .",
    "we note that the weaker bars have rounder less pinched orbits of the same apogee .",
    "figure 6b a comparison between a slow and a faster bar with the same bar strengths .",
    "we can see that the faster bar has a more elongated and strongly pinched orbit of the same apogee . in figure",
    "6c we can see that by decreasing the bar strength and increasing the bar pattern speed , differences in the shapes of orbits with the same apogee can be minimized .",
    "weakening the bar potential at the location of the ring ( equivalent to decreasing the disk mass - to - light ratio ) to less than @xmath1 of the maximal disk value causes the pinched orbits to be rounder and less pinched than the observed ring .",
    "we find that it is not possible to consistently match the morphology of the ring by raising the bar pattern speed in a weaker bar , since this decreases the radius of corotation to within the bar ends .",
    "for the orbits shown in figure 5 ( and the solid line in figure 6abc ) the corotation radius lies just outside the end of the bar at a radius of @xmath74 . the faster bar ( with corresponding orbit shown as open points in figure 6c ) which would fit the ring morphology places the radius of corotation at @xmath77 which lies within the end of the bar , a situation which",
    "is not thought to be theoretically possible ( @xcite ) . as a result",
    "we find that for an assumed inclination of @xmath0 the bar mass - to - light ratio must be greater than 70% of the maximal disk value .      for a lower galaxy inclination of @xmath45",
    "the strength of the @xmath58 component is about half as large of that with @xmath0 at the location of the ring ( see figure 4 ) . as expected from the previous section it is not possible to match the ring morphology with the periodic orbits without increasing the mass - to - light ratio past what we have defined as the maximal disk value or decreasing the radius of corotation to a radius smaller than the bar length .",
    "figure 7 shows orbits integrated for a maximal disk mass - to - light ratio with a bar corotation radius of @xmath78 .",
    "orbits with larger apogees than shown in figure 7 become self - intersecting with small loops at their minor axes and are probably unstable .",
    "the non - self - intersecting periodic orbits are too round to match the observed ring morphology .",
    "it is not possible to resolve the problem by raising the bar angular rotation rate since this would place the radius of corotation within the end of the bar . it would be possible to have a stronger bar or a larger mass - to - light ratio with a more carefully estimated maximal disk value at @xmath45 .",
    "for example if the rotation curve of the galaxy decreases with radius near the ring then the maximal disk value for mass - to - light ratio could be higher .",
    "the ring enveloping the bar which is quite blue ( see figure 1c ) may contain a large gas mass . including this gas mass increase the strength of the non - axisymmetric component ( @xmath58 ) of the potential and so cause the periodic orbits near the olr to be more elongated . in short we find that for an assumed inclination of @xmath45 the bar mass - to - light ratio must be greater than the maximal disk value assumed here .    for higher galaxy inclinations ,",
    "the outer ring becomes rounder and the bar lengthens ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "a mass - to - light ratio lower than the maximal disk value is required to match the observed morphology of the ring . in figure 8",
    "we show periodic orbits for a galaxy inclination of @xmath46 that resemble the morphology of the ring for a mass - to - light ratio that is @xmath79 of the maximal disk value .",
    "since the average radius of the ring is larger for this galaxy inclination than for lower inclinations , the bar angular rotation rate must be lower .",
    "mass - to - light ratios lower than @xmath80 again cause the ring to be too round to match the morphology of the ring .",
    "higher mass - to - light ratios than @xmath81 eliminated the r1 periodic orbits ( the resonance was very strong ) at the radius of the ring for pattern speeds that kept the corotation radius outside the bar ends . as a result",
    "we find that for an assumed inclination of @xmath2 the bar mass - to - light ratio must be within @xmath82 of the maximal disk value .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that the galaxy inclination is much higher than @xmath46 since at @xmath83 the ring is almost round and the outer isophotes of the galaxy are even more elongated ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "\\1 ) the ring morphology consists of gas in periodic non - self intersecting orbits near the outer lindblad resonance , and spiral structure in the ring does not cause the morphology to deviate significantly from these periodic orbits .",
    "many of these assumptions can be constrained with a velocity field that can determine the inclination and measure the rotation curve of the galaxy .",
    "however the first assumption listed above is of particular concern .",
    "strong spiral structure in the ring will cause the gas to deviate from the periodic orbit families explored here . while it is not unreasonable to expect that the gas is close to the periodic orbits ( in the same way gas in the milky way is primarily undergoing circular motion despite its spiral structure ) , future work should both study r1 ring galaxies with minimal spiral structure and investigate the role of the spiral structure in these rings .      in this paper",
    "we have explored the shape of the periodic orbits near the outer lindblad resonance in a ring galaxy using a non - axisymmetric gravitational potential based upon a near - infrared image of the bar .",
    "we find that the shape of the non - self - intersecting periodic orbits at the olr is affected by the strength of the non - axisymmetric component @xmath58 of the gravitational potential . a stronger bar ( corresponding to a larger @xmath58 ) or a faster bar result in more elongated orbits at the radius of the ring .    using the above assumptions , and comparing outer ring morphology of ngc  6782 with the integrated non - self - intersecting periodic orbits we find that the bar mass - to - light ratio can be constrained given an assumed galaxy inclination . for a galaxy inclination of @xmath73",
    "we find that a bar mass - to - light ratio greater than @xmath1 of the maximal disk value is needed to match the ring morphology .",
    "it is not possible to match the morphology of the ring with a weaker and faster bar since this places the bar corotation radius within the end of the bar .",
    "for @xmath2 we find a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath3 of the maximal disk value matches the morphology of the ring .",
    "for @xmath45 a value larger than the maximal disk value assumed here is required .",
    "a larger mass - to - light ratio could be allowed if a large gas mass is found in the ring enveloping the bar ( increasing the @xmath58 component of the potential ) , or if the rotation curve decreases near the ring .",
    "larger galaxy inclinations are unlikely for the following reasons : 1 ) the ring becomes round or aligned with the bar which is not supported by statistics of r1-type rings ( @xcite ) . however",
    ", ngc  6782 could be a special case .",
    "2 ) the outer isophotes of the galaxy become significantly elongated .",
    "deeper images showing the shapes of the isophotes past the ring may help to constrain the inclination angle of the galaxy .",
    "we note that here that the method considered here places a constraint on the the strength of the non - axisymmetric ( @xmath84 ) component of the potential from the bar .",
    "since the bar is necessarily a disk component this leads directly to a constraint on the disk mass - to - light ratio .",
    "once the rotation curve is observed the morphology of the ring gives a constraint on the disk mass - to - light ratio which is independent of any assumptions about the halo or dark matter distribution . as a result",
    "a measured rotation curve would allow us to measure the core radius of the dark matter halo using our values for the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "a measured rotation curve will also enable us to place a value on the maximal disk mass - to - light ratio assumed here and check whether our assumption of a flat rotation curve is a good one .",
    "modeling of an observed velocity field in the ring will make it possible to measure the mass - to - light ratio of the bar with more precision than with a purely morphological comparison as done here .",
    "velocities observed along the major axis of the ring should constrain the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "highly pinched orbits have slow speeds in their pinches , as inferred from small spacing in the equal time step points shown in figures 5 - 8 .",
    "the velocity field should also therefore limit which particular orbits are represented in the ring .",
    "the asymmetry of the velocity field will also constrain the degree of deviation from the periodic orbits caused by spiral structure in the ring .",
    "we also plan to observe other ring galaxies to find if high mass - to - light ratios are required generally .",
    "modeling of galaxies with different orientations should help resolve the uncertainties caused by projection .",
    "gas simulations of rings could be studied to discover how well closed orbits match the gas morphology in these systems , which particular orbits collect gas , and how close outer rings are to being perpendicular to their bars .",
    "the effect of spiral structure on the morphology of the ring should also be studied .",
    "if a near maximal disk value for the bar mass - to - light ratio is indeed required ( as suggested here ) then either the inner parts of galaxies have little dark matter , or the dark matter contained in the disk of the galaxy is non - axisymmetric and rotates with the bar .",
    "the second possibility implies that the `` conspiracy of shapes '' suggested by @xcite extends into the bar , and would lend support to the idea that dark matter halos are flattened ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , since if the dark matter rotates , it should be flattened .",

    "<S> the inferred mass - to - light ratio of the bar depends on the assumed inclination of the galaxy . with an assumed galaxy inclination of @xmath0 , for the orbits to be consistent with the observed ring morphology the mass - to - light ratio of the bar must be high , greater than @xmath1 of a maximal disk value . for @xmath2 , </S>",

    "<S> can be used to constrain the galaxy inclination as well as which periodic orbit is represented in the ring , further study will yield tighter constraints on the mass - to - light ratio of the bar . if a near maximal disk value for the bar is required , then either there would be little dark matter within the bar , or the dark matter contained in the disk of the galaxy would be non - axisymmetric and would rotate with the bar . </S>"
