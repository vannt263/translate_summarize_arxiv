    "the foundation of the theory of electronic structure of many - body systems is the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation for the many - variable wave function . in the knowledge of the hamilton operator , by an approximate wave - function method one can determine the ground - state energy as a variational expectation value which approaches the exact value from above .",
    "we term such approximations , a well - known prototype of which is the hartree - fock approximation , as wave - function optimal ones .",
    "an other class of approximations is named as density - optimal one , where we work with auxiliary orbitals of a schrdinger - like equation written by using an effective single - particle potential .",
    "this potential is a functional of the one - particle density , the basic quantity of density - functional theory @xcite .    between the above limiting cases",
    "there is the approximation which is based on a two - variable function , the reduced one - particle density matrix . in density - matrix - functional theory",
    "this one - matrix is the basic quantity @xcite . with an exact one - matrix not only",
    "the energy term related to the external potential is exact but the kinetic energy term as well .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the explicit dependence of the interparticle interaction energy on the one - matrix . owing to this difficulty",
    ", it has been the tendency in approximate methods to replace the two - particle density , the diagonal of the second - order density matrix , by ansatz kernels constructed from the one - matrix and its diagonal , the one - particle density .",
    "this rapid communication is devoted to a comparative study using an ansatz kernel with parametric point - wise representations for the input density and one - matrix .",
    "these are calculated for an exactly solvable one - dimensional model atom with two harmonically interacting externally confined particles .",
    "the model chosen constitutes a cornerstone in a large variety of fields in physics .",
    "it was introduced firstly by heisenberg in order to discuss the he atom problem @xcite .",
    "its application to nuclear physics dates back to moshinsky @xcite .",
    "below we summarize the necessary background needed to our present variational study .    using atomic units ,",
    "the time - independent schrdinger equation is solved for the singlet ground - state with the following @xcite one - dimensional hamilton operator @xmath4 which models , with coupling constant @xmath5 , the repulsive interaction of two quantum particles in a confining external field characterized by @xmath6 .",
    "the analytic solution is based on standard canonical transformations , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , of space variables . for the ground - state wave function one",

    "this equation shows that the virial theorem for limited motion is satisfied .",
    "the exact total energy @xmath19 and single - particle ( see , below ) density @xmath20 were already @xcite applied as constraining inputs in order to demonstrate the complete hohenberg - kohn - sham path with density - functionals @xcite .",
    "the unique effective single - particle potential @xmath21 , to a schrdinger - like equation , was determined as well @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lagrange multiplier ( chemical potential ) introduced along the path of a constrained ( fixed number of particles ) minimization with functionals .",
    "the local many - body potential @xmath24 $ ] is model - specific , i.e. , it is not universal .    with @xmath15 the reduced one - particle density matrix can be calculated from @xmath25 and its diagonal , @xmath26 , gives the normalized single - particle probability density @xmath20 as @xmath27 mathematically , the mapping between @xmath28 and @xmath20 is a linear one .",
    "the auxiliary orbital to a density - based product form @xmath29 is simply @xmath30 .",
    "notice that in the direct path from the correlated wave function to the single - particle probability density we may loose physical informations ( see , below for a concrete example ) since the mapping between the exact wave function and the one - matrix is a nonlinear one .",
    "precisely , it is this nonlinearity which makes the challenging inverse path from a given density @xmath20 back to the wave function @xmath15 a highly nontrivial ( at @xmath31 ) problem @xcite .",
    "in order to show more important details to the above - outlined a direct path , and thus establish our variational idea which will be based on an inverse path , we decompose @xmath15 by applying to it mehler s @xcite formula . after simple calculations , we get @xmath32 ^ 2 e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{\\omega}(x_1 ^ 2+x_2 ^ 2)}\\ , h_n(\\sqrt{\\bar{\\omega}}x_1)h_n(\\sqrt{\\bar{\\omega}}x_2)\\ ] ] in terms of hermite polynomials , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "this duality means that to any allowed repulsive coupling there exists a corresponding attractive one for which the calculated entropies should be equal . along the above direct path",

    "of course , in such a symmetric case for the operator - powers the parametric normalization of the kernel @xmath52 , which is given by @xmath53 , is satisfied as well . in other words , we have a proper global normalization for the exchange - correlation hole described otherwise by the physical @xcite pair correlation function of the many - body system . in recent attempts by taking @xmath54 , this fundamental rule",
    "is violated , as was mentioned @xcite explicitly .",
    "we will return to such parametrization in our last section .    in the light of the above",
    ", we arrived at the point where we can clearly state our idea on a parametrization based on the one - variable form of the exact density in eq .",

    "our idea is similar in spirit to the proposal made earlier @xcite within an extended thomas - fermi scheme to go beyond the fermi - dirac step - function , i.e. , the ideal momentum distribution .",

    "the re - parametrized kernel , denoted by @xmath65 , to be applied to determine the interparticle interaction energy takes the form of @xmath66 the required operator power ( @xmath67 ) is obtained , as before with @xmath45 and @xmath42 in @xmath28 , by the simple change @xmath68 in the one - matrix @xmath69 .",
    "the freedom via @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) allows us to write instead of the auxiliary , lower bound , @xmath70 of conventional density - functional theory , a parametric kinetic energy as @xmath71 which shows that we can tune the kinetic energy into the proper direction when @xmath72 , i.e. , when we have noninteger occupation numbers for parametric orbitals .",
    "unfortunately , this desired opportunity could give only a monotonic change since , as it is well - known , there is no upper bound for the kinetic energy .",
    "furthermore , with the exact density as input , the potential energy in the external field [ the second term in eq .",
    "( 3 ) ] is parameter - free .",
    "however , using the parametric mller - type approximation prescribed by eq .",
    "( 15 ) , we can define a kind of constrained - search @xcite within a framework fixed only by the exact density and the associated ( parametric ) one - particle density matrix as inputs . after straightforward calculation",
    "we get for the approximate ground - state energy @xmath73.\\ ] ] this form shows transparently the @xmath62-dependent terms of kinetic and interparticle origin .",
    "when @xmath74 and we treat @xmath75 as a variational parameter instead of fixing it to the kohn - sham ( ks ) value , we recover the well - known @xcite hartree - fock result where @xmath76 , thus @xmath77 , and we have a product - form ground - state as ( with @xmath75 ) in ks .    making differentiations in eq .",
    "( 17 ) , firstly @xcite at @xmath51 , we obtain as condition @xmath78 at the exact input - density , i.e. , at fixed @xmath75 in the kohn - sham auxiliary orbital . to get the unique right - hand - side , the shorthands introduced earlier at eqs .",
    "( 2 - 3 ) are employed .",
    "the solution is @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , starting from the point - wise decomposition of the exact density we arrive in our method with variable occupation numbers and fixed @xmath67 , at the exact ground - state energy @xmath80=e_{ex}$ ] of the correlated model .",
    "our isospectral deformation ( a quantum analog of the isoperimetric problem of queen dido of carthage ) of a real input @xmath20 seems to be useful to treat a correlated two - body system .",
    "this conclusion on a prototype model is similar to the one based on the single - particle green s function of many - body theory @xcite on a degenerate fermion system .",
    "there , the ground - state energy and the momentum distribution are completely determined by that function .",
    "the quasiparticle weight @xcite , in our case , could be @xmath81 ^ 2 $ ] .    at small interparticle coupling",
    "we get @xmath82 , i.e. , a similar scaling as in wigner s correlation energy defined by @xmath83 .",
    "such , traditional , definition differs from the one used in modern density - functional theory where one introduces @xmath84 as exchange - correlation energy . within the physically restricted class for approximate pair - densities with @xmath47",
    "now we analyze , without the loss of generality , the @xmath85 case where the fixed ( say , @xmath86 ) deviation measures a slight departure from the successful symmetric @xcite case investigated above .    the corresponding variational constraint on the energy results in @xmath87 the solution of this constraining equation becomes @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we plot an informative ratio @xmath89 , at two illustrative values @xmath90 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath91 ( dash - dotted curve ) . in general , @xmath92 but",
    "the situation changes as soon as @xmath36 grows . for large values of @xmath36",
    ", we have an opposite behavior @xmath93 . for each values of @xmath67 , there exists a value ( @xmath94 ) of the coupling for which @xmath95 .     as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "dashed and dash - dotted curves refer , respectively , to @xmath90 and @xmath91.,width=377 ]    in the light of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , we turn to an information - theoretic investigation of the above case .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the purity @xmath96 and the associated linear entropy @xmath97 , as in a recent calculation @xcite on the model system with triplet configuration .",
    "the purity is the inverse of the degree - of - correlation @xcite and is defined by @xmath98 ^ 2 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] the summation , performed with our occupation numbers @xmath56 , results in @xmath99 showing a deviation from idempotency at finite value of the interparticle coupling .",
    "the inequality obtained above at small enough @xmath36 shows that @xmath100\\geq{l[\\xi(\\lambda)]}$ ] . however , we got @xmath100\\leq{l[\\xi(\\lambda)]}$ ] at high enough @xmath36",
    ". therefore , our consideration of an information - theoretic measure @xcite of the minimum entropy deficiency principle , i.e. , minimum missing information principle , demonstrates that such quantity alone is not applicable as good measure of how correlated a hamiltonian is , in complete agreement with the forecast @xcite .",
    "we stress that our conclusion is based on the simultaneous consideration of the kinetic and potential energy components of an expectation value .",
    "a consideration based only on the kinetic component would orient us into the wrong ( maximum entropy ) direction , since in that case only a monotonic change would be allowed in the entropy .",
    "the point - wise - decomposed forms for the exact single - particle probability density and associated one - matrix of an exactly solvable interacting model atom are used in order to analyze energies obtained by a mller - type approximation for the pair - density . from the analysis we found that the flexibility of the parametric method developed is robust , and thus it can be a practically useful one among approaches which rest on restricted informations in absence of the exact wave function for a given schrdinger hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , our method can be considered as an extended @xcite kohn - sham approach suggested recently .",
    "its future extension , by using time - dependent occupation numbers @xcite , to the time - domain could be equally important @xcite since the time - dependent density functional theory is based on mapping @xcite and not on a variational constraint with schrdinger hamiltonian .    of course , the knowledge of a precise single - particle density is important in the method investigated .",
    "as it is well - known @xcite from practical density - functional theory , approximate densities could make dominating errors in many situations beyond those errors which are due to an approximate functional .",
    "our method could allow a desired future investigation on this challenging problem by changing slightly , for instance , the frequency in the kohn - sham orbital .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath101 approximation , in which one violates a normalization condition @xcite , could be a practically useful one according to numerical tests on different systems @xcite .",
    "in such treatments values of about @xmath102}$ ] are suggested . in our isospectral deformation method",
    "the @xmath101 case would require a simple change in the last term of eq .",
    "( 17 ) to @xmath103 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] finally , beyond the correlated two - particle case , an extension to the many - particle case could start with the so - called radical @xcite kohn - sham framework where one represents the spherical @xcite ground - state density in terms of one orbital .",
