    "in the past years many new excited charmed baryon states have been discovered by babar , belle and cleo . in particular , @xmath0 factories have provided a very rich source of charmed baryons both from @xmath0 decays and from the continuum @xmath1 . a new era for the charmed baryon spectroscopy is opened by the rich mass spectrum and the relatively narrow widths of the excited states . experimentally and theoretically , it is important to identify the quantum numbers of these new states and understand their properties . since the pseudoscalar mesons involved in the strong decays of charmed baryons are soft , the charmed baryon system offers an excellent ground for testing the ideas and predictions of heavy quark symmetry of the heavy quarks and chiral symmetry of the light quarks .",
    "charmed baryon spectroscopy provides an ideal place for studying the dynamics of the light quarks in the environment of a heavy quark .",
    "the charmed baryon of interest contains a charmed quark and two light quarks , which we will often refer to as a diquark .",
    "each light quark is a triplet of the flavor su(3 ) . since @xmath2",
    ", there are two different su(3 ) multiplets of charmed baryons : a symmetric sextet * 6 * and an antisymmetric antitriplet @xmath3 .    in the quark model",
    ", the orbital angular momentum of the light diquark can be decomposed into @xmath4 . where @xmath5 is the orbital angular momentum between the two light quarks and @xmath6 the orbital angular momentum between the diquark and the charmed quark .",
    "the lowest - lying orbitally excited baryon states are the @xmath7-wave charmed baryons . denoting the quantum numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the eigenvalues of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively",
    ", the @xmath7-wave heavy baryon can be either in the @xmath12 @xmath13-state or the @xmath14 @xmath15-state .",
    "it is obvious that the orbital @xmath13-state ( @xmath15-state ) is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under the interchange of two light quarks @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the total angular momentum of the diquark is @xmath18 and the total angular momentum of the charmed baryon is @xmath19 . in the heavy quark limit , the spin of the charmed quark @xmath20 and the total angular momentum of the two light quarks @xmath21 are separately conserved .",
    "there are seven lowest - lying @xmath7-wave @xmath22 arising from combining the charmed quark spin @xmath20 with light constituents in @xmath23 state : three @xmath24 states , three @xmath25 states and one @xmath26 state .",
    "they form three doublets @xmath27 and one singlet @xmath28 in the notation @xmath29 , where we have used a tilde to denote the multiplets antisymmetric in the orbital wave functions under the exchange of two light quarks .",
    "quark models @xcite indicate that the untilde states for @xmath30- and @xmath31-type charmed baryons with symmetric orbital wave functions lie about 150 mev below the tilde ones .",
    "the two states in each doublet with @xmath32 are nearly degenerate ; their masses split only by a chromomagnetic interaction .",
    "the next orbitally excited states are the positive parity excitations with @xmath33 .",
    "there are two multiplets for the first positive - parity excited @xmath22 with the symmetric orbital wave function , corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , see table [ tab : pp ] ( for other charmed baryons , see @xcite for details ) . for the case of @xmath36 , the total orbital angular momentum @xmath37 of the diquark",
    "is 2 , 1 or 0 .",
    "since the orbital states are antisymmetric under the interchange of two light quarks , we shall use a tilde to denote the @xmath36 states .",
    "the fermi - dirac statistics for baryons yields seven more multiplets for positive - parity excited @xmath22 states .",
    ".the first positive - parity excitations of @xmath30 charmed baryons and their quantum numbers .",
    "states with antisymmetric orbital wave functions ( i.e. @xmath38 ) under the interchange of two light quarks are denoted by a tilde .",
    "there are two multiplets @xmath39 and @xmath40 with symmetric orbital wave functions arising from the orbital states @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we use a hat to distinguish between them . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some of the @xmath43-wave and @xmath44-wave couplings of @xmath7-wave baryons to @xmath45-wave baryons can be determined . in principle , the coupling @xmath46 is readily extracted from @xmath47 with @xmath48 being identified as @xmath49 . however , since @xmath50 is kinematically barely allowed , the finite width effects of the intermediate resonant states could become important @xcite . before proceeding to a more precise determination of @xmath46 ,",
    "we make several remarks on the partial widths of @xmath51 decays .",
    "( i ) pdg @xcite has assumed the isospin relation , namely , @xmath52 to extract the branching ratios for @xmath53 modes .",
    "however , the decay @xmath54 occurs very close to the threshold as @xmath55 mev .",
    "hence , the phase space is very sensitive to the small isospin - violating mass differences between members of pions and charmed sigma baryon multiplets .",
    "since the neutral pion is slightly lighter than the charged one , it turns out that both @xmath56 and @xmath57 have very similar rates .",
    "( ii ) taking @xmath58 and using the measured ratios of @xmath59 and @xmath60 relative to @xmath61 , we obtain @xmath62 ( iii ) the non - resonant or direct three - body decay mode @xmath56 has a branching ratio of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "assuming the same for @xmath57 and using the measured total width of @xmath51 , we are led to @xmath64    consider the pole contributions to the decays @xmath65 with the finite width effects included .",
    "the intermediate states of interest are @xmath66 and @xmath67 poles .",
    "the decay rates depend on two coupling constants @xmath46 and @xmath68 . identifying the calculated @xmath69 with the resonant one , we find @xmath70 assuming that the total width of @xmath71 is saturated by the resonant @xmath72 3-body decays , pirjol and yan obtained @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "our value of @xmath46 is slightly smaller since in our case , the @xmath66 and @xmath67 poles only describe the _ resonant _ contributions to the total width of @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 baryons form a doublet @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath76 decays to @xmath79 , while @xmath77 decays to @xmath80 , resonating through @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 . using the coupling @xmath46 obtained from ( [ eq : h2fw ] ) and the experimental observation that the @xmath80 mode in @xmath77 decays is consistent with being entirely via @xmath83 @xcite , the predicted @xmath76 and @xmath77 widths are shown in table [ tab : strongdecayp ] .",
    "the predictions are consistent with the current experimental limits .",
    "some information on the coupling @xmath84 can be inferred from the strong decays of @xmath85 .",
    "assuming the widths of the states @xmath86 are dominated by the two - body @xmath44-wave modes @xmath87 , @xmath53 and @xmath88 , and applying the quark model relation @xmath89 @xcite , we then have @xmath90 which improves the previous limit ( [ eq : h2fw ] ) by a factor of 4 ."
