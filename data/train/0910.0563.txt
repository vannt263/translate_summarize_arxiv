    "they are : ( _ i _ ) to set up the system matrix ; ( _ ii _ ) to solve the linear system for the unknown surface currents ; and ( _ iii _ ) to calculate the reflection amplitudes .",
    "of the three , it is primarily the first two that are critical and , if not handled properly , particularly the second .",
    "for instance , the total cpu time taken to complete the calculation using single precision and an iterative solver for one angle of incidence and one surface realization with @xmath170 , including reading input and writing output data , is @xmath171 on an intel core2 cpu ( q9550 ) operating at @xmath172 and running the linux operating system . on the other hand , for the same simulation the three steps mentioned above take @xmath173 to set up the system matrix , @xmath174 to solve the linear system by the use of the iterative bicgstab method , and @xmath175 to calculate the reflection amplitudes on a @xmath176 grid , in total @xmath177 .",
    "hence , the additional steps of the calculation , like generating the surface , reading and writing data to file _ etc . _ , contribute only insignificantly to the overall cpu time ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "the computation times for other surface discretizations are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the reason that it takes a relatively long time ( compared to @xmath179 ) to set up the matrix elements is the cost of calculating the exponential function contained in the green s function .",
    "however , the most critical point to address when trying to reduce the overall cpu time , is the method used to solve the linear system . in this work , an iterative solver known as the stabilized bi - conjugated gradient method ( bicgstab )",
    "@xcite has been used , and found to perform well and to produce reliable results for our application .",
    "the iteration process of the bicgstab solver ( using a jacobi preconditioner ) was terminated when the relative error was @xmath180 ( or less ) , which for normal incidence and with @xmath170 required typically a little more then @xmath181 iterations when starting from an initial guess @xmath182 ( of course , other surface parameters and initial guesses may require more or fewer iterations in order to reach the desired accuracy ) . using a direct solver , like the lu - decomposition , would have taken significantly longer ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "for instance , the time taken to solve the linear system for @xmath170 by a direct lu solver is @xmath183 times longer than that taken by the bicgstab solver ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , this difference is expected to increase with increasing @xmath3 due to the different scaling with the number of unknowns ( as also shown by the times presented in table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that a direct solver , like the lu - decomposition , opens the possibility for carrying out calculations for several angles of incidence ( the right - hand sides of the system ) simultaneously with little addition to the overall computation time .",
    "this is not the case for the bicgstab - method , where the solution time for several angles of incidence scales linearly with the number of angles of incidence .",
    "there are , however , other iterative methods that can solve a linear system with several right - hand - sides with only moderate increase in computational times .",
    "one such method is the ( restarted ) generalized minimal residual method  ( gmres ) method  @xcite .",
    "compared to the bicgstab used here , the gmres is typically more memory demanding and , therefore , this possibility has not been explored in this work .    for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have repeated the calculations reported by tran and maradudin in ref .",
    "@xcite using the same numerical parameters ( the surface roughness parameters were already the same ) . for the calculations carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite solving the integral equations on a grid of @xmath184 surface points , each iteration ( of which there were six ) required @xmath185 cpu seconds ( on a cray xmp / ea-116 machine ) , and to calculate the scattered fields , in - plane or out - of - plane , required @xmath186 cpu seconds for each realization of the surface profile function , for a total of @xmath187 cpu seconds for each realization of the surface profile function .",
    "a similar calculation required only @xmath188 cpu seconds per surface realization , a dramatic improvement in speed   since only the scattered field in either the in - plane or out - of - plane configuration was calculated . ] .",
    "this dramatic reduction occurred for two reasons : first , we have the overall improvement in general computer hardware .",
    "second , we hold the whole system matrix in memory due to sufficient memory , while the approach used in ref .  @xcite was to regenerate the matrix elements as they were needed .",
    "this time cost of the latter is not insignificant , as we can see from table  [ tab:1 ] , and both factors contribute to the overall speedup .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the use of the method of moments and the biconjugate gradient stabilized method provides a formally exact solution to the problem of the scattering of an electromagnetic field from a two - dimensional , randomly rough , perfectly conducting surface , with a modest expenditure of computational time .",
    "moreover , the full angular distribution of the intensity of the scattered light , both co- and cross - polarized , was obtained by a formally rigorous approach for a strongly rough surface .",
    "such distributions can display rather complex angular patterns that are rooted in the multiple scattering processes taking place when light interacts with a strongly rough surface .",
    "due to the full angular intensity distribution being accessible , the conservation of energy was checked explicitly for all the calculations reported and found to be satisfied with an error smaller than @xmath189 , or better , something that testifies to the accuracy of the approach and a satisfactory discretization .",
