    "the zero - field eight vertex model , solved by baxter@xcite may be expressed either in terms of its original vertices , or as an ising model with hamiltonian : @xmath2 \\label{equ : h_spins}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath3 are ising spins on a square lattice .",
    "we note that the ising coupling is between _ next nearest _",
    "neighbours on the square lattice : at @xmath4 there are two independent sublattices , with ising coupling , @xmath5 within each sublattice .",
    "there is a transition at @xmath6 to a fourfold degenerate ordered state ( there are two ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic ground states , related by flipping all the spins on either sublattice ) . as @xmath7 is increased from zero , the lattices become coupled , and the transition moves to a higher temperature : the critical temperature @xmath1 satisfies : @xmath8 the transition to an ordered state occurs for all finite @xmath5 : we also note that if @xmath9 then the transition temperature will be much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "thus far we have considered only static ( thermodynamic ) properties of the eight - vertex model . in order to study the time evolution of the this model",
    ", we must specify dynamical rules .",
    "we use simple spin flips with rates given by glauber dynamics .",
    "we refer to the combination of the hamiltonian and the dynamical rules as the spin - flip eight vertex ( sev ) model .",
    "if we set @xmath10 in the sev model , we arrive at the ( two dimensional ) plaquette model@xcite . in this limit",
    "there is no ordering at any finite temperature : all two point static correlations vanish .",
    "this may be most easily demonstrated by noting that if @xmath10 then the hamiltonian is invariant under flipping all of the spins in any row or column of the square lattice .",
    "the dynamics of this model are dominated by a zero temperature dynamical fixed point for temperatures @xmath11 that are small compared to @xmath7 .",
    "since we are studying slow dynamics we work throughout at @xmath12 .",
    "we have now identified two temperature scales in the problem : the onset of glassy dynamics occurs at @xmath13 and the critical point in the system is at @xmath14 . if @xmath15 then we expect the slow dynamics to be observable only in the ordered phase : the more interesting case is @xmath16 , in which case the dynamics are slow near the transition , and we may investigate the effect of the effective kinetic constraint as we cool the system through @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore work at @xmath17 : from ( [ equ : def_tc ] ) , this means that @xmath18 . as a result",
    "we have the hierarchy @xmath19 which is obeyed throughout this paper .      before investigating the sev model more closely ,",
    "we establish the relationship between this model and physical glass - formers : it is not obvious at first sight precisely how a model of ising spins should be related to a atomistic system .",
    "the spin variables represent the microscopic degrees of freedom of the glass - former .",
    "this is distinct from the more heuristic approach taken in the fa and east models in which the spins represent a coarse - grained ` mobility field ' .",
    "the sev model is more similar to the plaquette model@xcite in that the effective kinetic constraint responsible for the critical slowing down at zero temperature is not inserted explicitly , but arises from the combination of the hamiltonian and simple spin - flip dynamics . in section  [ sec : dynamic ]",
    "we will comment briefly on how the dynamics may be interpreted within a ` mobility field ' picture like that of the fa model .    in the previous section we identified the two temperature scales in the model as the glassy onset temperature @xmath20 and the transition temperature @xmath21 . these separate the behaviour of the system into three regimes .",
    "we argue that the high temperature phase of the sev model with @xmath22 resembles a liquid - like state of the atomistic system , since it lacks any two point correlations between the spins .",
    "the second regime is @xmath23 : there are still no static correlations between the spins but there are strong _ dynamical _ correlations .",
    "this state resembles a viscous liquid whose relaxation time is large compared to microscopic timescales .",
    "we emphasise that the crossover between this regime and the high temperature behaviour is smooth : there is no sharp transition at @xmath0 . in the viscous liquid , the atomistic degrees of freedom are ` jammed ' over large regions of the system : relaxation in these regions is frustrated by large energy barriers .",
    "dynamical heterogeneity then arises naturally , due to the presence of mobile regions where the energy barriers are smaller than average .",
    "there are very many paramagnetic states in the spin system , even at low temperatures ( compared to @xmath7 ) : these resemble the many possible jammed states of the glass former .",
    "having argued that the paramagnetic phase of our model is liquid - like , and shows glassy behaviour at low temperatures , it is natural to interpret the transition in the model as a a freezing transition .",
    "we identify the ferromagnetic phase with the crystalline states of the glass - former .",
    "as the temperature is lowered through @xmath1 the entropy falls rapidly as the very many paramagnetic ( jammed ) states are now thermodynamically unstable with respect to the ferromagnet .",
    "the effect of the dynamical fixed point on the transition between paramagnet and ferromagnet is the main subject of the following sections .",
    "in particular we show that ` supercooling ' of the paramagnetic state is possible as long as @xmath24 .",
    "we now discuss the microscopic structure of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states in the model of equation ( [ equ : h_spins ] ) .",
    "this will allow us to identify the relevant correlation functions for our study of the dynamics of the system .",
    "we describe the paramagnetic state in terms of small deviations from the behaviour of the model with @xmath10 , and the ferromagnetic state in terms of excitations in an ordered background .",
    "this will lead us to interpret the transition in terms of free defects above @xmath1 that become confined at the transition , forming composite excitations .",
    "we will also show that these descriptions are valid even rather close to the transition , despite being based on expansions around the fully ordered or fully disordered states . in other words , the critical region is very narrow .",
    "we begin by recalling some results for the @xmath10 limit of the model@xcite . at @xmath10 ,",
    "we write @xmath25 , and the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath26 where the @xmath27 are ising - like degrees of freedom , defined on the plaquettes of the square lattice . in the thermodynamic limit , these plaquettes are independent degrees of freedom , that define the state of the spin system , up to transformations that flip all the spins in any row or column ( leaving @xmath28 invariant ) . we observe that this results in a ground state entropy proportional to the linear size of the system , @xmath29 ( there are @xmath30 spins in the system ) .    in finite systems ,",
    "the presence of boundary conditions may impose constraints on the plaquettes .",
    "for example , imposing periodic boundaries on the spins means that the number of excited plaquettes in all rows and columns must be even ( we believe that this fact led to the strong finite size effects seen in @xcite ) .    as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the low temperature states of the model with @xmath10 are best interpreted in terms of closed loops with excited plaquettes at each vertex ( see figure  [ fig : poly ] ) .",
    "if we move across the lattice , any spin flip is accompanied by our crossing the perimeter of a loop . if @xmath10 then each plaquette is independent : the vertices of the loops are a free lattice gas with density @xmath31 .",
    "the free energy per site is simply @xmath32 \\label{equ : f_j=0}\\ ] ]    at finite @xmath5 , we make use of baxter s solution of the eight vertex model@xcite . in appendix",
    "[ app : series ] , we show that the free energy per site for @xmath33 is given approximately by @xmath34 \\label{equ : f_pm}\\ ] ] since we work exclusively at @xmath35 , equation  ( [ equ : f_pm ] ) is rather close to the @xmath10 expression  ( [ equ : f_j=0 ] ) .",
    "we focus on two correlation functions , the density of excited plaquettes @xmath36 , and the density of broken ising bonds , @xmath37 .",
    "their definitions are : @xmath38    in the representation of figure  [ fig : poly ] , the concentration of vertices is given by @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is related to the total perimeter of the closed loops of that figure , and measures the spatial ordering of the vertices .",
    "the free plaquettes observed at @xmath10 have @xmath39 .",
    "as @xmath37 is reduced , the reduction in the loop perimeter starts to constrain the positions of the vertices , and spatial correlations appear .",
    "the internal energy per site is given by @xmath40 so we have @xmath41 and @xmath42 . using ( [ equ : f_pm ] )",
    ", the paramagnetic state has @xmath43^{-1 } \\\\",
    "n_b & \\simeq & ( 1/2 ) - \\frac{\\sinh(2j / t)}{\\cosh(2j / t)+e^{-2d / t}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that introducing @xmath5 leads to small negative corrections to the @xmath10 values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . however , for @xmath12 , the concentration of excited plaquettes is still approximately @xmath44 and these plaquettes are only weakly interacting since @xmath45 .",
    "a typical configuration is shown in figure  [ fig : states ] : there are no two point correlations between the spins , but the loop vertices are dilute since @xmath46 .",
    "we now consider the system at temperatures lower than @xmath1 .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app : series ] , a good approximation to the free energy per site in the ferromagnetic phase is @xmath47 which is valid for @xmath48 . in this regime @xmath49    for excitations in a ferromagnetic background",
    ", @xmath37 is directly related to the perimeter of the closed loops shown in figure  [ fig : poly ] .",
    "equations  ( [ equ : nbfm ] ) and  ( [ equ : npfm ] ) are therefore consistent with rectangular excitation loops with an excited plaquette at each corner ( total energy cost @xmath50 ) .",
    "the expectation of the loop perimeter is approximately @xmath51 .",
    "this is much smaller than the typical spacing between loops , given by @xmath52 .",
    "this situation is sketched in figure  [ fig : states ] .",
    "the density of loops is given by the number of ways of forming such a loop , multiplied by a boltzmann factor , @xmath53 .",
    "we therefore identify the entropy per loop as @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the apparent divergence of the perimeter ( and therefore the entropy ) at small @xmath5 represents the breakdown of the ordered state which happens at @xmath1 .",
    "the transition to the paramagnetic state occurs when the energy cost for adding two vertices to the loop ( @xmath55 ) is balanced by the entropy gain associated with adding an extra rectangular segment to the loop .",
    "this entropy gain is approximately @xmath56 .",
    "we may therefore obtain an estimate of the transition temperature by setting @xmath57 .",
    "the result is @xmath58 which differs from the exact result ( [ equ : def_tc ] ) only by the constant leading factor of 4 .",
    "the real transition temperature is lower than that predicted by this method because interactions between the loops act to reduce the energies at large perimeters .",
    "thus we interpret the transition to the paramagnet as deconfinement of localised composite excitations .",
    "the state becomes disordered when the loop size becomes comparable with the spacing between loops .",
    "the magnetisation and correlation lengths may also be calculated in similar series ( see appendix  [ app : series ] ) .",
    "the magnetisation , @xmath59 , may be used to calculate the fraction of spins opposed to the mean spin , @xmath60 assuming that the lowest - lying excitations are rectangular domains with four excited plaquettes per domain , we expect a relation of the form @xmath61 .",
    "we see that this is true for small @xmath62 [ recall that @xmath63 is a small number , although expansions about @xmath10 are not valid in general since we are in an ordered phase ] .",
    "thus we have arrived at the following picture of the thermodynamics of the sev model .",
    "there is a density of excited plaquettes @xmath36 , which sit on the corners of overlapping closed loops .",
    "the total loop perimeter is measured in terms of the parameter @xmath37 : the point @xmath39 is the maximally disordered spin field , in which the excited plaquettes are free . away from the critical region ( which is narrow ) ,",
    "the excited plaquettes are nearly free in the paramagnetic phase : in the ferromagnetic phase then they are confined on corners of rectangular loops whose typical size is much smaller than their inverse density .",
    "so far , our microscopic arguments have been purely thermodynamic : we have not considered any dynamics . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the sev model .",
    "this section contains the key results of this paper .",
    "we briefly describe the dynamics of the paramagnetic state , which are essentially independent of @xmath5 .",
    "we then discuss the onset of ordering as the temperature is lowered through @xmath1 .",
    "we will find that supercooled states exist near @xmath1 , which are well described by a simple ` mobility field ' picture for times shorter than their lifetime .",
    "we then discuss the extent to which these states can be regarded as metastable , and what determines their lifetimes .",
    "we begin with a very brief review of the dynamics in the paramagnetic state with @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath5 may be treated perturbatively in this regime , we write the hamiltonian as in equation  ( [ equ : h_plaq ] ) . flipping a single spin",
    "involves flipping of the four plaquette variables adjacent to that spin .",
    "thus spins adjacent to four unexcited plaquettes have a flipping rate that is suppressed by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "however , the flip rate of spins adjacent to exactly one excited plaquette are suppressed only by a factor @xmath65 .",
    "the excited plaquettes mark mobile regions in which spin flips are rather likely .",
    "thus the model resembles kinetically constrained systems such as the fa model@xcite .",
    "the relaxation time of the spins depends on the temperature and on the density of excited plaquettes , according to @xmath66 .",
    "this arises from localised one - dimensional diffusion of pairs of excited plaquettes@xcite . in equilibrium",
    ", we have @xmath67 , so the relaxation time diverges as @xmath68 .",
    "more precisely , we have the scaling relation@xcite @xmath69 for the on - site autocorrelation function in equilibrium at a given value of @xmath70 .",
    "this is strong glass behaviour in the classification of angell @xcite .",
    "we now turn to results for the sev model below @xmath1 , where @xmath5 may not be treated perturbatively .",
    "we discuss the phenomenological similarities and differences between this model and physical glass formers .",
    "we then interpret this behaviour with the aid of mean field rate equations .",
    "we start this section by demonstrating how a supercooled state may be formed below @xmath1 .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the system by means of simulations which use a continuous time monte carlo algorithm@xcite , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the number of excited plaquettes in each row and column is constrained to be even in this treatment , so the linear size of the system must be greater than @xmath71 for reliable results . some of the main features of the dynamics of the sev model are shown in figure  [ fig : energy_q ] .",
    "we measure the energy density of the system with respect to the ground state : @xmath72 the dashed trace in figure  [ fig : energy_q ] shows the internal energy density after quenching to a temperature , @xmath73 , such that @xmath74 . after an initial transient , the system ages in a power law fashion towards equilibration at @xmath75 .",
    "the plateau at @xmath76 is a characteristic feature of models with kinetic constraints ( whether explicit@xcite or emergent@xcite ) .",
    "it represents the onset of ` activated ' dynamics .",
    "the equilibration time for the paramagnet scales as a power of @xmath44 .",
    "all these features are seen in the model with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the full trace in figure  [ fig : energy_q ] shows the behaviour on quenching to a temperature @xmath77 satisfying @xmath78 , but with @xmath77 close to @xmath1 .",
    "the behaviour resembles that of the quench to @xmath73 , including apparent equilibration at @xmath79 .",
    "however , this is state is not stable , and the energy falls further at longer times .",
    "this behaviour resembles that of glass - formers , where the state on the lower plateau would be called a supercooled liquid .",
    "the behaviour is also qualitatively similar to that observed in @xcite .    in order to focus on the supercooled states , we show further simulations in figure  [ fig : np_cool ] .",
    "the system is cooled through @xmath1 in a single small step .",
    "we plot @xmath36 and @xmath37 as a function of time . from the plot of @xmath36 ,",
    "we see that the density of free excitations responds relatively quickly to the change in temperature : it falls from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , where it appears to stabilise .",
    "the response of @xmath37 to the cooling is much slower .",
    "recall that this correlation function measures the clustering of excited plaquettes .",
    "this clustering is a much slower process than the creation and annihilation steps leading to a change in the concentration of excitations .",
    "looking at the late times in figure  [ fig : np_cool ] when the clustering does start to occur , the system ages towards the ferromagnetic state with both @xmath36 and @xmath37 falling together .",
    "taking the two traces in figure  [ fig : np_cool ] together , we see that there are two separate timescales : one is associated with changes in @xmath36 ; the other with changes in @xmath37 .    turning to the supercooled state itself",
    ", it is clear from figure  [ fig : np_cool ] that it has @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this resembles closely the state that would be formed if we set @xmath10 in the hamiltonian .",
    "thus the effect of the interactions between plaquettes ( the term proportional to @xmath5 in the hamiltonian ) is to set the lifetime of the supercooled state .",
    "the properties of the state itself are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude that the supercooled state in the sev model can be well described by the much simpler plaquette model of equation  ( [ equ : h_plaq ] ) : a kinetically frustrated model with trivial thermodynamic properties .",
    "this is the assumption made when describing glass - formers by simple models of dynamical heterogeneity@xcite : in the sev model , this assumption seems to be reasonable .",
    "a key property of supercooled states is that two - time correlation functions should be stationary within the supercooled state .",
    "that is , expectation values of the form @xmath84 should be independent of @xmath85 as long as @xmath86 is less than the lifetime of the states . in figure",
    "[ fig : stat ] , we show that the supercooled state with @xmath87 and @xmath39 has this property .",
    "since the excited plaquettes are uncorrelated in this state , it may be prepared manually , without the need for simulation .",
    "further , the single spin autocorrelation function in the supercooled state is the same as that in the model with @xmath10 at the same temperature .",
    "it therefore obeys the dynamical scaling law of equation  ( [ equ : tau_scaling ] ) , and is independent of @xmath5 .    as a final comment on figure  [ fig : stat ]",
    ", we note that the criterion that the supercooled state should be long - lived is fulfilled , since stationarity holds over timescales much longer than the single - spin relaxation time .",
    "thus the data in that figure is consistent with the picture of a supercooled state that appears to equilibrate in a metastable basin .",
    "having identified a supercooled state at temperatures near @xmath1 , we now proceed to discuss its lifetime .",
    "we prepared states with @xmath87 and @xmath39 and measured the time taken for @xmath37 to fall to @xmath88 .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig : nuc ] .",
    "the lifetime gets very large both near @xmath1 , and in the limit @xmath89 .    near @xmath1 ,",
    "the states are supercooled . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the lifetimes are similarly long , but in this case they are of the same order as the spin relaxation time .",
    "these states are not equilibrated in a metastable basin ; rather , their long lifetimes reflect the drastic slowing down of all timescales as the temperature is reduced .    from figure",
    "[ fig : nuc ] , we conjecture that the nucleation time has the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a ( microscopic ) rate that depends only weakly on @xmath11 and @xmath1 .",
    "physically , the nucleation rate is suppressed by a boltzmann factor that arises from the activated dynamics , and by a factor of @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the free energy difference between ordered and disordered phases .    in other words ,",
    "behaviour near @xmath1 is characterised by a separation of the nucleation time from the relaxation time , @xmath94 .",
    "the minimum in the nucleation time occurs at @xmath95\\ ] ] the relaxation time in the paramagnet given approximately by @xmath96 , so at the minimum we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the result is that @xmath99 as long as @xmath100 , which is the regime of interest in this section .",
    "the two timescales are well separated for all temperatures between @xmath101 and @xmath1 .",
    "this separation results from the small amount of free energy that is released on ordering .",
    "states in which these times are well - separated are ` supercooled ' , in the sense that the degrees of freedom associated with the relaxation time appear to equilibrate in a state that is known to be unstable at long times .    at very low temperatures",
    ", we see that @xmath102 will become smaller than the extrapolated relaxation time @xmath103 .",
    "the result is that the physical relaxation time at low temperatures is smaller than @xmath104 .",
    "the dynamics of the aging state are faster than those of a similar state with @xmath10 .",
    "these results may be interpreted in the picture of the model as a combination of a zero temperature dynamical fixed point and a finite temperature thermodynamic singularity .",
    "the spin relaxation time is controlled by the activated dynamics associated with the zero temperature fixed point .",
    "it is large compared to microscopic timescales , but small compared to the lifetime of the supercooled state .",
    "that lifetime is very long near the thermodynamic transition : the slowing down is due to the small free energy difference between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states .",
    "we comment here that ` soft modes ' at large lengthscales are not relevant to the behaviour observed in simulations , due to the narrowness of the critical region .",
    "while supercooled states are familiar in systems with first order phase transitions , they are not usually observed near second order transitions , such as the one discussed in this work . in first order systems ,",
    "the nucleation time may be predicted by thermodynamic arguments .",
    "the free energy of a ( @xmath105-dimensional ) droplet of ordered phase in a disordered background is approximately @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the linear size of the droplet , @xmath108 the surface tension and @xmath93 is the free energy difference between the two phases .",
    "thus , nucleation requires the formation of a droplet of linear size @xmath109 , with an associated free energy barrier proportional to @xmath110 ( in two dimensions ) .",
    "the nucleation rate is therefore suppressed by a factor @xmath111 .",
    "this is exponential suppression of nucleation .    from ( [ equ : t_nuc ] )",
    ", we see that the sev model has linear suppression : the nucleation rate is proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "this second order system has weaker suppression than that predicted for first order systems .",
    "since the transition in the sev model is second order , there are processes by which the bulk of the system may be continuously changed from paramagnet to ferromagnet , without a large free energy barrier .",
    "these processes are slow because they require co - operative motion of many spins , but the exponential slowdown that would result from a high energy intermediate state is not observed . while the phenomenology of the sev model resembles that of first order systems , the lifetimes of supercooled states tend to be shorter than those in systems with diverging free energy barriers near @xmath1 . in this respect , the sev model is an imperfect model of a glass - former .",
    "however , we argue that the free energy barrier between ordered and disordered states in first order systems should mean that the supercooled states are less affected by the critical point than those of the sev model . thus , if the thermodynamic singularity is largely irrelevant in this model , then we expect it to be even less relevant in similar first order systems .      in order to understand the results of the previous section , we give a brief discussion of the aging behaviour of the system .",
    "we parameterise this behaviour in terms of mean - field rate equations for the observables @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this will provide further evidence that the supercooled states are characterised by fast dynamics for the concentration of excited plaquettes , @xmath36 , combined with much slower dynamics for their spatial ordering ( measured by @xmath37 ) .    in paramagnetic states with @xmath12 ,",
    "the equilibrium value of @xmath37 is @xmath112 and that of @xmath36 is @xmath113 .",
    "aging towards equilibrium occurs at @xmath114 , with @xmath115 ( a sample trace is shown in figure  [ fig : plaq_age ] , but the observed exponent is independent of temperature , as long we work between @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "the rate is limited by the slow diffusion of excited plaquettes ( there is no simple diffusive process for isolated excitations ) .",
    "there are two regimes for the aging towards the ferromagnetic state .",
    "we define @xmath101 as the temperature at which the nucleation time is minimal ( recall figure  [ fig : nuc ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : energy_q ] , after quenching to @xmath11 near @xmath1 ( @xmath116 ) , the system appears to equilibrate at @xmath87 ( with @xmath114 ) , before aging towards the ferromagnetic state . in figure",
    "[ fig : sc_age ] we show a similar scenario , but continuing to slightly longer times . at these long times , the system ages with the ratio @xmath117 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath37 happens on the long timescale given by @xmath102 .",
    "however , the plaquette concentration , @xmath36 , is reacting on a much faster timescale .",
    "the interpretation is that @xmath36 has stabilised in an environment set by the current value of @xmath37 .",
    "it seems that the stable value of @xmath36 is around @xmath118 .",
    "if instead we quench to a temperature below @xmath101 , there is no apparent equilibration at @xmath119 .",
    "instead , the effect of finite @xmath5 becomes apparent when @xmath120 .",
    "there is a transient effect as @xmath37 begins to change , but the long time behaviour again has a constant ratio @xmath121 ( see figure  [ fig : slow_age ] ) .",
    "simulations indicate that the constant value of @xmath122 seems to depend on @xmath1 as shown , and to vary only weakly with @xmath11 .",
    "further , the exponent associated with the aging appears to be similar to that in the paramagnetic state ( around @xmath88 ) .",
    "the natural interpretation is that the aging of these states is controlled in the same way as the aging of the paramagnet : by the slow diffusion of excited plaquettes .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath37 are now faster than those of @xmath36 , and the spatial ordering of the excited plaquettes is responding faster than the plaquette density .    this description of the aging behaviour is consistent with the following conjectured rate equations @xmath123   ( x_b - 2 n_b ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{equ : mf_nb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 .",
    "the significance of this quantity is that @xmath37 would equilibrate to @xmath125 if the concentration of plaquettes were constrained to be equal to @xmath36 . the exponent @xmath126 in equation  ( [ equ : mf_np ] ) is fixed by the exponent @xmath88 for the power law decay of the energy in the paramagnetic phase ( as shown in figure  [ fig : plaq_age ] ) .",
    "the the overall scaling of time with temperature in that equation is also fixed by the aging of the paramagnetic states .",
    "the scaling of time in ( [ equ : mf_nb ] ) is determined by the scaling of the nucleation time in equation  ( [ equ : t_nuc ] ) .",
    "the adjustable parameters of the theory are therefore the rates @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and the constant , @xmath129 .",
    "the two rates are microscopic frequencies reflecting the co - operative motion of the spins required to change @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "the constant @xmath129 determines the ratio of @xmath37 and @xmath36 when the aging is controlled by plaquette diffusion ( as in figure  [ fig : slow_age ] ) .",
    "the instability of the supercooled state means that @xmath130 : the data of figure  [ fig : slow_age ] is consistent with @xmath131 , as mentioned above .",
    "we make no attempt to justify these rate equations on microscopic grounds . for example , the exponent @xmath126 in equation  ( [ equ : mf_np ] ) is a non - trivial decay exponent for an annihilation - diffusion problem in which diffusion of single excited plaquettes is suppressed by the kinetic constraint .",
    "we imagine ` integrating out ' all the microscopic degrees of freedom : the effect of the complicated fluctuation effects appears only in this exponent",
    ". however , while their microscopic origin is unclear , the interesting feature of these equations are ( 1 ) the different temperature scaling of the times associated with the two degrees of freedom , and ( 2 ) , the presence of points at which one degree of freedom is not changing .",
    "the first feature leads to a separation of timescales in the problem .",
    "when this is combined with the second feature , the apparent metastability of the supercooled states becomes possible . in this case , the faster degree of freedom is @xmath36 , which equilibrates at @xmath118 on a timescale that is fast enough that @xmath37 can be considered to be constant .",
    "the aging of the supercooled state then has a timescale determined by the rate equation for @xmath37 .",
    "that degree of freedom is trying to reach apparent equilibration at @xmath132 , but @xmath36 is the faster degree of freedom , and is moving the target downwards just as fast as @xmath37 decreases towards it .",
    "this results in the aging at constant @xmath133 that is shown in figure  [ fig : sc_age ] .",
    "an exactly analogous process is taking place in figure  [ fig : slow_age ] , except that @xmath36 is now the slow degree of freedom .",
    "the central point of the above argument is that the slow degrees of freedom set a ` target value ' for the fast ones , at which the fast degrees of freedom appear to equilibrate when viewed on the fast timescale .",
    "this is the sense in which the states discussed in the previous section are ` supercooled ' .",
    "their lifetime is then set by the slow degrees of freedom , and this lifetime is much longer than relaxation timescales in these states . to understand the correlations in the aging state , it would be desirable to study the thermodynamics of the excited plaquettes while working at fixed @xmath37 . however , this is well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "note that there is no provision in equations  ( [ equ : mf_np ] ) and ( [ equ : mf_nb ] ) for equilibration in a ferromagnetic state .",
    "however , the large internal energy difference between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states means that this equilibration is not observed on timescales that are accessible in simulation .",
    "therefore , equations  ( [ equ : mf_np ] ) and  ( [ equ : mf_nb ] ) appear to be valid over timescales that are several orders of magnitude longer than the lifetimes of the supercooled states .",
    "it is simple to verify that the qualitative behaviour of figures  [ fig : np_cool ] and [ fig : plaq_age]-[fig : slow_age ] may be fitted by equations  ( [ equ : mf_np ] ) and  ( [ equ : mf_nb ] ) , with appropriate values of @xmath134 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : mf_fit ] , in which we show reasonable agreement .",
    "note however , that the onset of nucleation from the supercooled state is more sudden than that predicted by the mean field equations .",
    "the initial ordering is slower than the power law predicted by these simple rate equations .",
    "the requirement of different parameters to fit the different simulations in figure  [ fig : mf_fit ] show the rather simplistic assumptions for the temperature scaling in the mean field equations .",
    "that is , the linear suppression of the nucleation rate with @xmath135 is valid only near @xmath1 , necessitating adjustment of @xmath128 at smaller temperatures .",
    "we have already commented that @xmath129 will be temperature dependent , but that this dependence has a weaker effect on @xmath136 than the exponential dependence of that quantity on @xmath1 .",
    "the fits of figure  [ fig : mf_fit ] using these mean field equations support our interpretation of figure  [ fig : nuc ] in terms of purely dynamical effects that do not depend on thermodynamic quantities like free energy barriers and spinodal points .",
    "we have shown that the sev model can be interpreted in terms of a high temperature state in which excitations are free and point - like , and a low temperature phase in which these free excitations are confined into composite objects , with a characteristic size that is smaller than their spacing .",
    "the dynamics of the paramagnet are well described in a ` mobility field ' picture similar to the fa model .    near the transition to the ordered phase , ` supercooled ' paramagnetic states have long lifetimes .",
    "two - time correlation functions show stationarity in these states , and both their dynamics and their thermodynamics are well - described by the plaquette model",
    ". however , these states have finite lifetimes , beyond which stationarity is lost and it becomes clear that they are unstable to the ferromagnetic state .",
    "this situation resembles the situation in physical glass - formers , except that the presence of a first order transition in those systems means that the lifetimes of the supercooled states diverge much faster near @xmath1 than in the sev model .",
    "we have also shown that the mean field rate equations , ( [ equ : mf_np ] ) and ( [ equ : mf_nb ] ) , are a suitable framework for describing the out of equilibrium ( aging ) behaviour of the sev model .",
    "we end this work with some comments about the significance of these results in the context of the literature . comparing with the work of cavagna  _ _ et al.__@xcite",
    ", we note the similarity between the phenomenology of their model and the sev model .",
    "however , the exact solution of the eight vertex model , and the understanding of the dynamics of the paramagnetic state that arises from previous work on the plaquette model allow us to investigate the behaviour from a more microscopic viewpoint .",
    "we illustrate this with three points .",
    "firstly , the internal energy of the sev model changes very rapidly around @xmath1 . from simulation evidence alone , we might ( erroneously ) conclude that the transition was first order .",
    "however , we know from theoretical considerations that the transition is second order",
    ". this knowledge is important when discussing the possible metastability of supercooled states .",
    "secondly , the power law suppression of nucleation near @xmath1 in the sev model results from the fact that our transition is second order . for a first order transition we would expect an exponential suppression .",
    "the nature of this suppression in @xcite does not seem to be clear . and finally , we are able to identify the minimum in figure  [ fig : nuc ] as arising not from the crossing of a spinodal , but rather from a crossover in timescales",
    ".    we would also like to point out some similarities between the paramagnetic phase of the sev model and the models which are conjectured to be controlled by the behaviour of entropic droplets @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", the invariance of the hamiltonian at @xmath10 under flipping a whole row or column of spins leads to a large ( but non - extensive ) ground state entropy .",
    "we have shown that the introduction of @xmath5 is largely irrelevant above @xmath1 , and in the supercooled states .",
    "therefore , we may interpret the low temperature paramagnetic states ( @xmath137 ) as a ` mosaic ' of the many @xmath10 ground states .",
    "the ` droplets ' are referred to as ` entropic ' in this scenario .",
    "this name arises because there does not seem to be an energetic argument for their stability , so it assumed that they are stabilised by some entropic mechanism . in the plaquette model ,",
    "the borders between ` droplets ' of each ground state are not one dimensional as one might expect , but rather arise from point - like excited plaquettes .",
    "this situation was alluded to in the recent paper of bouchaud and biroli@xcite . since there is no perimeter for a surface tension to couple to , the entropic forces are strong enough to stabilise the ` mosaic ' state .",
    "this is the situation in the sev model at finite @xmath5 , but @xmath138 .",
    "if we accept the plaquette model as a realisation of the entropic droplet picture , it is interesting to note that the only fixed point in that model is at zero temperature .",
    "that is , although the entropy falls rapidly as the temperature is reduced through @xmath0 , any extrapolation that leads to @xmath139 at a finite temperature is not valid .",
    "rather , the entropy remains regular at all temperatures ( even those in which the glassy phase is completely unstable to the crystal ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath140 all the way down to @xmath141 ( where @xmath142 is the entropy associated with the plaquette model and @xmath143 is the entropy of the sev model with the same value of @xmath7 and at the same temperature ) . in this scenario",
    "the kauzmann paradox @xcite is seen as arising from an unphysical linear extrapolation of the glassy entropy .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that the plaquette model limit of the sev model describes its behaviour in both stable and supercooled paramagnetic states .",
    "this model resembles both the mobility field description of glassy systems ( as exemplified by the fa model ) and the entropic droplet picture .",
    "however , there is no finite temperature fixed point in the theory of the glassy states ; thus kauzmann s paradox is avoided .",
    "taken together , these results are further evidence that theories without thermodynamic singularities at finite temperature are suitable for describing glassy states @xcite .",

    "we acknowledge financial support from epsrc grants no .",

    "in this appendix , we consider the series for the free energy given by baxter@xcite : @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 depend on the model parameters @xmath148 and @xmath63 .",
    "the parameter @xmath149 in baxter s calculation is @xmath150 in the sev model since the hamiltonian is invariant under @xmath151 rotations .",
    "the dependence of @xmath145 and @xmath146 on the original parameters @xmath152 is rather indirect : the main task of this appendix will be to derive simple relations between @xmath153 and @xmath154 in the ferromagnetic phase .",

    "that is , @xmath174 for the series of ( [ equ : f_series ] ) to converge quickly , we require @xmath175 : in that case ( [ equ : q_def ] ) reduces to @xmath176 , and therefore we have the approximate relation @xmath177 whose condition for validity is that @xmath170 be small , which requires that @xmath178 .",
    "this is the condition that we are well inside the ferromagnetic phase , as is clear from ( [ equ : def_tc ] ) .    in order to evaluate the terms in ( [ equ : f_series ] ) , we also require an approximate form for @xmath159 .",
    "the definition of @xmath159 is @xmath179 from which the relation @xmath180 is clear .",
    "this integral may be expanded in a series around @xmath181 .",

    "the result is that @xmath183 substituting into ( [ equ : f_series ] ) , and ignoring all terms with @xmath184 , we arrive at @xmath185 which gives the result ( [ equ : f_fm ] ) , qualified by the validity condition @xmath186 from which we note that this is not an expansion about @xmath141 , but rather a useful approximation to the free energy in this part of the parameter space ."
