    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are variable , off - nuclear , x - ray point sources in nearby galaxies for which the implied luminosity of the source exceeds the isotropic eddington limit for a @xmath1 black hole ( unless otherwise noted , in this work the term `` luminosity '' means the luminosity the source would have if it radiates isotropically ) . in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ era ,",
    "a large number of these sources have been detected ( see , e.g. , fabbiano & white 2003 , miller & colbert 2004 , swartz et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra and variability properties of the strong majority of ulxs suggests that they are accreting sources .",
    "these sources have attracted a great deal of observational and theoretical attention , in part because their luminosities suggest that they may harbor intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ; @xmath4 ) .    as with any new class of sources , in the case of ulxs it was initially tempting to identify the whole class as entirely one kind of source or another . the first _",
    "study of the antennae galaxies suggested a population of imbhs ( fabbiano , zezas , & murray 2001 ) , but it was not long until a theoretical investigation suggested the ulxs in the antennae are stellar - mass sources ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) ; earlier work suggested relativistic beaming in ulxs ( reynolds et al .",
    "it may be that ulxs , in particular those at the lower end of the ulx luminosity distribution , are stellar - mass black holes ( or even neutron stars in rare cases ) .",
    "however , a growing number of ulxs have been identified which are strong imbhcs .",
    "due in part to recent observations which have obtained more sensitive spectra and lightcurves , cool accretion disks have been found in some of the most luminous ulxs ( @xmath0  erg / s ) .",
    "temperature is inversely related to black hole mass ( @xmath5 ) in standard accretion disks ; the fact that these ulxs are 510 times brighter than stellar - mass black hole candidates ( bhcs ) and yet have disks which are 510 times cooler than the disks in bhcs identifies them as strong imbhcs ( see , e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we directly compare the luminosity and disk temperature of these imbhc ulxs , with a number of well - known stellar - mass bhcs .",
    "this sample of ulxs indeed appears to be a distinct , and perhaps rather homogeneous set of sources consistent with harboring imbh primaries .",
    "we selected ulxs for which published fluxes imply luminosities of @xmath0  erg / s , and for which a soft thermal component is required at the 3@xmath6 level of confidence ( or higher ) in the low - energy part of an x - ray spectrum which requires two continuum components .",
    "six sources satisfy these selection criteria : ngc 1313 x-1 , ngc 1313 x-2 , m81 x-9 ( holmberg ix x-1 ) , ngc 4559 x-7 , holmberg ii x-1 , and ngc 4038/4039 x-37 ( antennae x-37 ) . see table 1 for a list of references for these sources .",
    "m82 x-1 is the most luminous ulx known , and in some respects it may be the single best imbhc ulx ( see , e.g. , strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) .",
    "however , it lies in a region of significant diffuse emission , and its low energy spectrum is poorly determined .",
    "therefore , we have not included this source in our comparison .      in an effort to prevent possible biases and to ensure a representative sample , we selected stellar - mass black hole candidates which cover a range of binary inclinations , primary masses , companion types , distances , and absorbing columns .",
    "this sample includes : lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , 4u 1543@xmath7475 , xte  j1550@xmath7564 , 4u 1630@xmath7472 , gro  j1655@xmath740 , and grs  1915@xmath8105 .",
    "these are among the best - studied stellar - mass bhcs .",
    "it should also be noted that this sample includes both persistent sources or sources undergoing very long outbursts ( lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , grs 1915@xmath8105 ) , and transient sources ( 4u 1543@xmath7475 , xte j1550@xmath7564 , 4u  1630@xmath7472 , gro j1655@xmath740 ) with outbursts which may last as much as a year ( or longer ) followed by quiescent periods with fluxes 56 orders of magnitude lower , lasting months to years .",
    "see table 1 for a list of references for these sources .",
    "the luminosity and disk temperatures we use in this paper are those derived by the authors in the references listed in table 1 from their spectral fits to each source using a simple and phenomenological model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody ( mcd ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) and power - law spectral components ( both modified by neutral interstellar absorption ) .",
    "the energy range over which the spectral fits were made to the ulx sources and stellar - mass black hole sources differed considerably , due to the different lower energy thresholds of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , and _ rxte_. in most cases , the ulx spectra were fit in the 0.210.0  kev or 0.310.0  kev range .",
    "in contrast , the stellar - mass black hole spectra were generally fit in the 3.025.0  kev or 3.0100.0  kev range . to perform a meaningful comparison between these sources , we converted the flux and luminosity measurements in the differing energy ranges to the 0.510.0  kev range .",
    "this conversion was accomplished by entering the exact spectral model for each published spectral fit into xspec version 11.2 ( arnaud & dorman 2000 ) , and measuring the `` unabsorbed '' flux of each model in the 0.510.0  kev range . for the ulxs in particular , the 0.2100.0  kev luminosity",
    " more representative of a bolometric luminosity        is a few times higher than the 0.510.0  kev luminosity . in some cases ,",
    "the published disk temperatures were `` effective temperatures ''  converted from `` color temperatures '' by application of a color correction factor , which attempts to account for effects such as spectral hardening from radiative transfer through a disk ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni , fabian , & ross 2000 ; makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) . in these cases",
    ", we converted the effective temperature to a color temperature .",
    "color temperatures are compared directly to color temperatures in this work .",
    "this introduces no significant temperature bias ; a recent study has shown that the correction factor for imbhs should be very similar to that sometimes applied to stellar - mass black holes ( fabian , miller , & ross 2004 ) .",
    "the lower energy bound of the 0.510.0  kev range is somewhat higher than the present lower energy bounds of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ; however , history suggests that as all x - ray detectors age , the lower energy bound gradually increases . this range was chosen to be forward  looking , and to avoid any biases inherent in relying too heavily on the lowest bins in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ bandpasses .    to understand the properties of the ulx sources within the context of bhcs in their brightest states",
    ", we plotted the luminosity and disk temperature of each ulx , and the corresponding data for the five most luminous observations of each bhc in our sample ( see figure 1 ) . in selecting the brightest bhc observations",
    ", we are attempting to select those phases wherein each source is closest to its eddington luminosity . in all cases ,",
    "the errors on the disk color temperatures are 90% confidence errors . for the ulx sources , the luminosity errors are the 90% confidence errors in the measured flux .",
    "a review of the literature shows that constraints on the distance to given galactic sources can change considerably over time with refined measurements , especially when extinction is particularly high . to be conservative ,",
    "the luminosity errors on the stellar  mass black holes were set by taking the best - fit measured flux , and enforcing fractional errors of @xmath9% .",
    "this value is somewhat arbitrary , but certainly greater than most quoted errors , and represents a best - guess value based on the broad literature .",
    "the difference between the imbhc ulxs and standard , stellar - mass bhcs is shown clearly in figure 1 .",
    "the ulxs are generally 510 times more luminous than the bhcs , and have inner disk color temperatures 510 times lower than the bhcs ( it should be noted that while it is possible to make a relatively cool disk appear hotter  e.g. , via compton - upscattering in some hot material  it is not possible to make an intrinsically hot disk appear cool ) .",
    "equally importantly , the ulxs in figure 1 are clustered together , suggesting they are fundamentally similar . in those bhc sources which span a reasonable range in @xmath3 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath10 and @xmath3 ( a trace of @xmath11 ) are positively correlated .",
    "it is expected that the inner disk temperature should be positively correlated with @xmath11 ( see , e.g. , equation 5.43 in frank , king , & raine 2002 ) .",
    "if a bhc is to reach the luminosity window occupied by these ulxs , then , it is expected that its disk temperatures should increase accordingly .",
    "indeed , xte j1550@xmath7564 was initially famous for flaring to 6.8  crab  a factor of a few brighter than the highest points in figure 1 . in an observation which occurred within that flare , sobczak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measured an inner disk color temperature in excess of 3  kev .",
    "it is interesting to explore the origin of the separation between the ulxs and bhcs in @xmath12 shown in fig .  1 .",
    "to understand where bhcs lie in this space when their disk temperatures approach those seen in the ulxs , in fig .  2 we have added the five data points with the lowest disk temperatures from each bhc in the high luminosity sample with such data .",
    "figure 2 clearly shows that when stellar - mass bhc inner disk temperatures approach those seen in the ulx sample , their luminosity has decayed to @xmath13  erg / s  generally two orders of magnitude ( or more ) below the luminosity of the ulxs .",
    "note that there is a clear @xmath14 trend in the bhc data , as expected for standard disks .",
    "this plot also demonstrates that cool disk components can be detected in galactic stellar - mass black holes even with _ rxte _",
    "( which has a low energy bound of 2  kev ) .",
    "it is not the case that very cool disks have not yet been detected in galactic sources at high luminosities because of instrumental thresholds , galactic column densities , or a combination of these . at their highest luminosities , stellar - mass black holes",
    " regardless of companion type , orbital period , distance , or intervening absorption  do not have disks as cool as those found in imbhc ulxs .",
    "the comparison undertaken in this work demonstrates that ulxs in our sample are clearly different than our representative sample of stellar - mass bhcs .",
    "these ulxs are more luminous but have cooler thermal disk components than standard stellar - mass bhcs ; these facts can be explained naturally if the ulxs harbor imbhs . the comparison presented here makes the distinction more concrete , and demonstrates that the differences are not due to instrumental effects ( e.g. , detector energy thresholds ) , observational effects ( e.g. , column density ) , or astrophysical effects ( e.g. , companion type or orbital period ) .    optical , radio , and even x - ray data ( see pakull & mirioni 2003 ; miller et al .",
    "2003 ; miller , fabian , & miller 2004 ; strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) suggest that the high luminosity of these ulxs can not easily be explained through funneling in the inner disk ( e.g. king et al .",
    "2001 ) , through relativistic beaming ( e.g. reynolds et al .  1997 ; kording , falcke , & markoff 2002 ) , or through an alternative accretion flow geometries wherein a photosphere and shocks are postulated instead of the conventional disk and corona ( king 2003 ) .",
    "this comparison further demonstrates the problems with present theoretical alternatives to imbh primaries in our ulx sample . in figure 1 and figure 2 , it is clear that the stellar - mass bhc 4u 1543@xmath7472 ( @xmath15 , orosz et al .",
    "2004 ) exceeds its _ isotropic _ eddington limit ; the source luminosity would be a factor of a few higher still if the energy band considered extended either down to 0.1 kev or up to 100.0  kev .",
    "4u  1543@xmath7375 has an inclination of @xmath16 ( orosz et al .",
    "2004 ) and funneling might be a means to introduce sufficient anisotropy to avoid violating the eddington limit .",
    "it is also possible that a `` slim disk '' solution may allow a luminosity in excess of the isotropic eddington limit ( watarai , mizuno , & mineshige 2001 ; begelman 2002 ) .",
    "it is important to realize that although either explanation for 4u 1543@xmath7475 may hold , 4u 1543@xmath7475 is not observed to have an anomalously low inner disk color temperature .",
    "the clustering of the ulxs in figure 1 and figure 2 suggests that they may be fundamentally similar .",
    "the similarity may be that these sources harbor imbhs with masses that lie in a rather narrow range .",
    "it is difficult to identify the mass range implied for these sources precisely : scaling the ulx luminosities to the isotropic eddington luminosity for a @xmath1 black hole is sensitive to the energy range on which the luminosities are inferred , and scaling the ulx inner disk color temperatures to those seen in stellar - mass bhcs is sensitive to the temperature assumed to be typical for those sources when they accrete near to their eddington limit . for these ulx sources ,",
    "a reasonable mass range may be @xmath17 ( see , e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2003 ; miller , fabian , & miller 2004 ; cropper et al .",
    "if they are accreting at approximately one tenth of their eddington limits , lower masses implied by eddington limit scaling would come more into line with the high mass estimates that come from scaling the ulx inner disk color temperatures to an inner disk color temperature of 1  kev in bhcs .      the soft thermal component in these ulx spectra have been fit with disk models .",
    "this is because there are no compelling soft x - ray emission lines ( individual lines significant at the 3@xmath6 level or higher , excluding fe  k@xmath18 lines which are likely due to disk reflection ) yet reported in any ulx spectrum .",
    "thus , thermal plasma models are not statistically required , and simpler spectral forms are assumed .",
    "however , even in spectra with moderate sensitivity ( the ulx spectra so - far obtained are certainly of moderate sensitivity ) , it is difficult to statistically rule - out thermal plasma models . matters are further complicated by the fact that some ulx lie near to star - forming regions , where a thermal plasma may be present but unrelated to the source ( m82 x-1 is a good example ; see strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) .",
    "although the contribution of a thermal plasma to the soft excess in these ulxs would seem to be small , improved spectra are needed to tightly constrain any such contribution .",
    "soft excesses have been found in a number of agn , which have temperatures similar to those seen in the ulxs in this sample when fit with a disk model ( much too hot for such massive black holes ; see gierlinski & done 2004 ) .",
    "the origin of the soft excess in these agn  and whether or not it is due to a disk  remains uncertain .",
    "the `` big blue bump '' would seem to be far more likely to be the primary disk contribution in these agn .",
    "photosphere plus shocks models are as implausible in these sources as they are in ulxs ( see miller , fabian , & miller 2004 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that the excess may be due to relativistically  skewed soft x - ray absorption edges ( gierlinski & done 2004 ) or relativistically - skewed disk reflection features ( fabian et al .",
    "although it has been suggested that ulxs in elliptical galaxies may only be background agn ( irwin , bregman , & athey 2004 ) , the proximity of the ulxs in this sample to their galactic nuclei , star - forming regions , or spiral arms suggests that they are properly associated with their host galaxies and not background sources . even though these imbhc ulxs are unlikely to be background agn with soft components , the difficulties found in understanding the soft x - ray excesses in a number of agn illustrates that the spectral continuum is not well - understood in all accreting sources .",
