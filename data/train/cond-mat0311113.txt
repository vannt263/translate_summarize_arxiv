    "the study of the distribution of the income of workers , companies and countries started a little more than a century ago when italian economist vilfredo pareto investigated data of personal income for different european countries and found a power law distribution that seems not to depend on different economic conditions of the countries . in 1887 , in his book _ cours deconomie politique _ @xcite he asserted that in all countries and times the distribution of income and wealth follows a power law behavior where the cumulative probability @xmath0 of people whose income is at least @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 , where the exponent @xmath3 is named pareto index .",
    "this universal power law is now called pareto law and he found himself that the index assumes values typically close to 1.5 for several countries .",
    "the reduction of the slope @xmath3 denotes a higher inequality of the income distribution .",
    "however , recent data suggest that pareto s distribution does not agree with observed data over the middle range of income , but it is generally accepted that it provides a good fit to the distribution of high range of income .",
    "many other distributions of income were proposed , supported by international empirical data , and the distribution behaves in a log - normal , exponential or levy way @xcite in the middle income range .",
    "for instance , there are data from japan and usa that are fitted by a log - normal distribution in middle range plus a power law for high income one @xcite , data from united kingdom income and wealth fitted by an exponential law ( middle range ) and a power law ( high range ) @xcite and data from brazil @xcite worker s income and enterprise capital that are fitted by a log - normal plus a power law for high range of income @xcite .    one of the goals of the study of wealth distribution is to determine the social inequalities implied in a given model of economic exchanges .",
    "many ways to quantitatively measure the fairness of a given income distribution have been proposed in the economic science . among them , the gini index is well known and frequently used . in brief , for any given wealth density function @xmath4 , with mean @xmath5 and a given number @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath7 represents the cumulative fraction of population with wealth bellow @xmath8 and lorenz function @xmath9 is defined as the fraction of the total wealth which is attributed to the poorest @xmath10 percentage of the society . it easy to show that @xmath11 .",
    "gini index can be then defined as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it assumes values between 0 percent ( perfect equality ) and 100 percent ( perfect inequality ) .",
    "recently we developed a simple parameter free model for the competition among different economic agents within a conservative model .",
    "results for the wealth distribution has been published @xcite and also considering the effect of a small world network @xcite . within this model",
    "we obtained an exponential gibbs - style distribution for the wealth , with a finite lower threshold or poverty line , that is characteristic of models with extremal dynamics . in spite of the fact that this kind of distribution seems to be at stake when compared with pareto law , the idea of a society that take measures in order to improve the situation of the most impoverished is compatible with the propositions of john rawls , in his book `` a theory of justice '' @xcite , directed towards an inventive way of securing equality of opportunity as one of the basic principles of justice .",
    "he asserts that _ no redistribution of resources within ... a state can occur unless it benefits the least well - off _ and this should be the only way to prevent the stronger ( or richer ) from overpowering the weaker ( or poorer ) .",
    "it seems that a minimum dynamics , as that proposed in the bak - sneppen model @xcite , when applied to economics , is a way to ensure to the poorest agent a chance to improve its situation .    in the next section",
    "we resume the principal assumptions of the model and the principal results of the numerical simulations .",
    "the calculation of the gini index and the comparison with wealth distribution of several countries will be presented in section [ ineq ] along with the conclusions",
    "the conservative exchange market model ( cemm ) @xcite is a simple macroeconomic model that consists of an one - dimensional lattice with @xmath13 sites and periodic boundary conditions , where every site represents an economic agent ( individuals , industries or countries ) . to each agent",
    "it is assigned some wealth - parameter that represents its welfare , like the gni for countries or salary for individuals .",
    "we choose an initial configuration where the wealth is a number between 0 and 1 distributed randomly among agents .",
    "the dynamics of the system is supported on the idea that some measure should be taken to modify the situation of the poorest agent . in this context",
    ", we model this process by a minimum dynamics @xcite : at each time step , the poorest agent , i.e. , the one with the minimum wealth , will take some action , trying to improve its economic state .",
    "since the outcome of any such measure is uncertain , the minimum suffers a random change in its wealth @xcite .",
    "we assume that whatever wealth is gained ( or lost ) by the poorest agent it will be at the expense of its neighbors and we assume that it is equally debited ( or credited ) between its two nearest neighbors on the lattice , making the total wealth constant .",
    "so , the cemm dynamic can be reduced as follows :    * find out the site with minimum wealth @xmath14 ; * substitute @xmath15 to @xmath16 , a new random number between 0 and 1 extracted from an uniform distribution ; * make the difference , @xmath17 * updating the neighbors : + @xmath18 + @xmath19 + note that if @xmath20 is positive ( negative ) the wealth of the neighbors will be reduced ( increased ) by @xmath21 .     for the model with interactions to nearest neighbors ( upper curves ) and with global interactions ( lower curves ) .",
    "in both cases we have superposed scaled data corresponding to _ _ _ _ @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the histograms were built using @xmath25 consecutive states , after a transient of @xmath26 steps has elapsed . ]    numerical simulations on this model showed that , after a relatively long transient , the system arrives at a self organized critical ( soc ) state with a stationary wealth distribution ( figure [ distrisal]@xcite ) in which almost all agents are beyond a certain threshold . on fig[distrisal ] we represent both the cases of local exchanges and of global exchanges ( mean field solution ) ; in the former case the poverty line is @xmath27 and above this threshold the distribution of agents is an exponential @xmath28 , with @xmath29 @xcite , i.e. , there are exponentially few rich agents while the mass of them remains in what we call a _",
    "middle class_. in the second case the figure show the globally coupled ( _ mean field _ ) exchanges ( lower curves ) .",
    "this corresponds to a situation in which the agents with which the exchange takes place are chosen at random and not based on geographical proximity .",
    "this mean field solution exhibits a lower threshold , @xmath30 , and beyond it also an exponential distribution , @xmath28 , but with a higher value of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution , in the soc state , of the position of the system s minimum and maximum wealth is quite different . while the site of minimum wealth is changing continuously , generating avalanches of all sizes among neighbors , the wealthiest site is stable over relatively long periods of time @xcite as it is represented by the lines in the figure [ g3d ] . indeed , even when affected by an avalanche the maximum can frequently recover its status after a short time .",
    "not only the absolute maximum is stable , but also a privileged group , whose wealth is around the same value of the maximum , remains in its prosperous position for quite a while .",
    "this group is also privileged by having high wealth values , well above the market average . in the mean - field case",
    "the rich sites are also stable , but over shorter periods of time .",
    "we also observed that the probability that the minimum asset agent improve its situation in a time step is relatively high .",
    "it is very high at the beginning of the simulation , then it decreases during the transient to finally converge to a finite value , @xmath32 as it is shown on figure [ prob ] .",
    "we remark that the probability is well above 0.5 , so this minimum dynamic has the effect of improve , in the average , the situation of the poorer agents .",
    "inequalities are related to social and economic phenomena and is a subject of much debate .",
    "the fraction of rich and poor people in a country depends on the inequalities of the income distribution .",
    "the standard way to determine the inequality of a wealth distribution is with the help of quintile tables that show the percentage of national income received by equal percentiles of individuals or households ranked by their per capita income levels .",
    "for example in a welfare state as sweden the richest 20 percent of the population receives about 4 times more than the poorest quintile , while in a _ ruthless _ capitalistic country like brazil the richest quintile receives more than 25 times more than the poorest quintile .",
    "table 1 gives the quintile data for a few countries , while full data can be obtained in the world bank site@xcite .           to measure income inequality in a country and to make a comparison among countries more accurately , economists use lorenz curves and gini indexes .",
    "a lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income against the cumulative percentages of recipients . in fig [ gini ]",
    "we have represented the lorenz curves for brazil , sweden and spain . for comparison ,",
    "we have plotted in same figure the lorenz curve of an hypothetical absolutely equalitarian income distribution that is the straight line with slope equal 1 .",
    "this figure shows that brazil s lorenz curve strongly deviates from the hypothetical line of absolute equality while that for sweden lies much nearer and that for spain in the middle of both .",
    "this means that of these three countries , brazil has the highest income inequality and sweden the lowest",
    ". we also constructed lorenz curves for the local and global cases of cemm model ( figure [ gini ] ) .",
    "clearly we see that the global case have a lorenz curve very similar to sweden , while the local case is close to perfect equality .",
    "the gini index is even more convenient than a lorenz curve when the task is to compare income inequality among many countries ; it is calculated as the area between a lorenz curve and the hypothetical line of absolute equality .",
    "it assumes values between 0 percent ( perfect equality ) and 100 percent . of course , real gini indexes are always in between .",
    "we calculated the gini index for the local and global cases .",
    "for the local case , the gini index is 8.07 , close to perfect equality , while its value is 24.71 for the global one ( figure [ gini ] ) .",
    "this last value is very close to that sweden ( 25.0 ) , and also close to values of other european developed countries .",
    "concluding , the analysis of the gini index shows that globalization ( mean field case ) increases the economic inequalities in a conservative economy .",
    "moreover , the poverty line in global case is well bellow that of the local case ( figure [ distrisal ] ) .",
    "another interesting aspect is that the minimum dynamic favors the poorest agent , so promoting wealth redistribution in the sense defined by rawls @xcite .",
    "also , from a strictly economic point of view , high inequality means lower exchanges , and so it implies in a reduction of the economic activity ."
