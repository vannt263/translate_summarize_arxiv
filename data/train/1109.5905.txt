    "our experiment relies on the coherent manipulation of atomic quantum states using light pulses @xcite .",
    "we use telecom based laser sources that provide high frequency stability and power in a compact and integrated setup @xcite . starting from a @xmath2 vapor , we load in @xmath5 a cloud of about @xmath6 atoms laser cooled down to 10 @xmath7k , and select the atoms in a magnetic field insensitive ( @xmath8 ) zeeman sublevel .",
    "we then apply a velocity selective raman light pulse @xcite carrying two counterpropagating laser fields so as to keep @xmath9 atoms which enter the ai with a longitudinal velocity distribution corresponding to a temperature of 300 nk .",
    "the raman laser beams are aligned along the plane wings direction ( y axis , figure 1 ) and are retroreflected by a mirror attached to the aircraft structure and following its motion .",
    "the ai consists of a sequence of three successive raman light pulses to split , redirect and recombine the atomic wavepackets ( see figure 1d ) .",
    "the acceleration measurement process can be pictured as marking successive positions of the free - falling atoms with the pair of raman lasers , and the resulting atomic phase shift @xmath10 is the difference between the phase of the two raman lasers at the atom s successive classical positions , with respect to the retroreflecting mirror @xcite .",
    "as the raman beam phase simply relates to the distance between the atoms and the reference retroreflecting mirror , the ai provides a measurement of the relative mean acceleration @xmath11 of the mirror during the interferometer duration , along the raman beam axis .",
    "the information at the output of the ai is a two - wave interference sinusoidal signal @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the transition probability between the two @xmath2 ground states , and @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) is the offset ( resp .",
    "the amplitude ) of the interference fringes .",
    "this signal is modulated by the atomic phase shift @xmath16 , where @xmath17 nm is the raman lasers effective wavevector and @xmath18 is the time between the light pulses ( see the first `` methods '' subsection for the calculation of the phase shift ) .        in the aircraft ,",
    "the acceleration along y ( figure 2a ) fluctuates over time by @xmath19 ( 1 standard deviation ) , and is at least three orders of magnitude greater than the typical signal variations recorded by laboratory - based matter wave inertial sensors .",
    "for this reason , the signal recorded by the ai first appears as random , as shown in figure 2b . to quantify the information contained in the atomic measurements , we use mechanical accelerometers ( mas ) fixed on the retroreflecting mirror and",
    "search for the correlation between the mas and the ai @xcite .",
    "we use the signal @xmath20 continuously recorded by the mas to estimate the mean acceleration @xmath21 which is expected to be measured by the ai at time @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the experimental cycle time ( see the first `` methods '' subsection ) . plotting the atomic measurements",
    "@xmath24 versus @xmath21 reveals clear sinusoidal correlations between the mechanical sensors and the ai , both at 1-g ( figure 2c ) and in 0-g ( figure 2d ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the ai truly holds information on the mirror acceleration @xmath11 .",
    "we note that this result stands for the first demonstration of the operation of an atom accelerometer in an aircraft and in microgravity .",
    "we now consider the application of our matter wave sensor to precise measurements of the plane acceleration , by operating the ai beyond its linear range .",
    "for that purpose , we determine the ai acceleration response , defined by @xmath25 , independently from the mechanical devices .",
    "we have developped a method ( see the `` methods '' section ) to estimate this response ( i.e. the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , and the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the interferometer , which determines the acceleration noise of the sensor , @xmath26 .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath14 and @xmath15 enables us to extract the acceleration @xmath27 from the atomic data @xmath24 by inverting the model @xmath28 . in this way",
    ", the acceleration is known within the region where the interferometer model can be inverted unambiguously and corresponding to an acceleration interval of range @xmath29 . to obtain the total acceleration",
    ", we need the information on the reciprocity region @xmath30 $ ] where the ai operates at measurement time @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the interference fringe number where the measurement point is located ( see the `` methods '' section ) . to determine @xmath32",
    ", we use the mas which have a reciprocal response over a wide acceleration range .",
    "thus , our instrument consists in a hybrid sensor which is able to measure large accelerations thanks to the mechanical devices , and able to reach a high resolution thanks to the atom accelerometer .",
    "figures 3a to 3c illustrate the measurement process that we use to measure the plane acceleration during successive 1-g and 0-g phases of the flight ( figure 3d ) , with high resolution .          due to their limited performances , mainly their nonlinear response and intrinsic noise ( see the `` methods '' section ) ,",
    "the mas provide a signal which is not perfectly proportional to the acceleration @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to errors on the estimated acceleration @xmath33 which blur the mas - ai correlation function and might prevent from finding the fringe index @xmath32 where the ai operates .",
    "these errors increase with the ai sensitivity and with the acceleration signal @xmath11 . for a given acceleration level ,",
    "the good measurement strategy consists in increasing @xmath18 up to @xmath34 where the mas can still resolve the correlation fringes .",
    "this will set the scale factor @xmath35 of the ai .",
    "the sensitivity of the accelerometer is then determined by the snr of the matter wave sensor , which is estimated independently from the mas with our method .",
    "for instance at 1-g , where @xmath36 , the mas enables us to increase the ai interrogation time up to @xmath37 and to resolve the correlation fringes .",
    "future improvements will rely on the use of well characterized mas , in particular on a calibration of their scale factor at the @xmath38 level over the sensitivity bandwidth of the ai , to achieve interrogation times @xmath39 .",
    "high frequency ( @xmath40 ) vibration damping could also be used to constrain the frequency range where the mas are needed , and therefore push forward a particular sensor technology .",
    "second , parasitic inertial effects due to the rotation of the plane might be experienced by the matter wave sensor and not by the mas .",
    "at 1-g , the atoms fall down before interacting with the raman beams ( aligned along the y axis ) , so that the interferometer has a physical area and is thus sensitive to the sagnac effect . the resulting coriolis acceleration measured by the ai and not by the mas",
    "might impair the correlation and limit the performance of the hybrid sensor . for shot to shot fluctuations of the plane rotation of the order of @xmath41 , we estimate a limit to the sensitivity at the @xmath42 level at 1-g . this error source may be significantly reduced in the future with the use of additional sensors to measure the rotation of the plane and to take it into account in the calculation of the estimated acceleration .    finally , the atomic snr limits the sensitivity of the inertial sensor . during the flight",
    ", we measure at 1-g a snr of 3.1 for @xmath43 , which is in agreement with the value measured in our laboratory for the same interrogation time . with our experimental setup , the signal ( @xmath44 ) is essentially limited by the imperfections of the atomic beam splitters and mirror due to the temperature of the cloud and to the gaussian intensity profile of the raman beams , while the noise is mainly due to detection noise .",
    "in these conditions , with @xmath23 , the acceleration noise of the ai equals @xmath45 . at this sensitivity level ,",
    "the hybrid sensor is able to measure inertial effects more than 300 times weaker than the typical acceleration fluctuations of the aircraft .",
    "we emphasize that reaching such a high resolution is possible thanks to the appropriate combination of mas ( see the `` methods '' section ) , the success of operating the ai in the plane , and the use of our method for the acceleration measurement . in the present configuration of the experiment",
    ", the snr degrades at 1-g when @xmath46 increases above @xmath47 because the atoms fall down and escape the raman and detection beams @xcite .",
    "this limitation could be overcome thanks to additional raman beam collimators and by changing the orientation of the detection lasers . in 0-g ,",
    "the experiment falls with the atoms and the snr is not constrained by gravity any more .",
    "the snr may also be improved significantly in the future thanks to a better detection system ( e.g. more stable detection lasers ) and the use of ultra - cold atoms .",
    "we focus now on the microgravity operation of the matter wave inertial sensor and on its possible application to fundamental physics tests such as that of the uff .",
    "such a test can be carried out with two ais measuring the acceleration of two different atoms with respect to the same mirror that retroreflects the raman lasers . in airborne or spaceborne experiments ,",
    "the mirror constitutes an ill - defined inertial reference because of the craft s vibrations .",
    "this might degrade the sensitivity of the test , unless the vibrations impact the two interferometers in the same way .",
    "vibration noise rejection occurs when conducting differential measurements such as in the operation of gradiometers @xcite or gyroscopes @xcite , and is expected in uff tests based on atom interferometry @xcite .",
    "the rejection efficiency depends on the two species used for the uff test and is maximum for simultaneous interrogation of the two atoms ( see supplementary information ) . in the case of a finite rejection",
    ", the impact of the acceleration noise can further be reduced by measuring the vibrations of the mirror with mas to substract them from the differential phase measurement . in this way",
    ", the mas are used to release the requirements on the vibration damping of the craft as they measure the accelerations not rejected in the differential operation of the two ais .",
    "the efficiency of that technique is limited by the performances of the mas as their imperfections ( e.g. their non - linearities ) translate into residual vibration noise impairing the differential acceleration measurement . in the following ,",
    "we investigate vibration noise rejection by operating our @xmath48rb sensor in a differential mode .",
    "we use a sequence of 4 light pulses to build a two - loop ai @xcite which is equivalent to two successive one - loop interferometers head to tail ( figure 4b ) .",
    "the 4-pulse ai provides a signal resulting from the coherent substraction of two spatially and temporally separated inertial measurements and is therefore expected to be less sensitive to the low frequency inertial effects .        to illustrate the noise rejection , we operate the 3-pulse and 4-pulse interferometers with a same total interrogation time of 20 ms , and compare the mas - ai correlation for each geometry ( figure 4 ) . figures 4c and 4d show that the quality of the correlation ( ratio of the sinusoid contrast to the mean error bar ) is clearly improved in the differential geometry compared to the 3-pulse interferometer . to understand this difference",
    ", we estimate the total noise of the correlation , defined as @xmath49 .",
    "it results , in the linear range of the interferometer , from the quadratic sum of two independent contributions : the atomic phase noise @xmath50 , and the vibration noise @xmath51 not measured by the mas . as we can estimate @xmath52 independently from the correlation",
    "( see the second `` methods '' subsection ) , the comparison of @xmath53 and @xmath52 indicates whether the sensor sensitivity is limited by the atomic noise ( @xmath54 ) or by the residual vibration noise ( @xmath55 ) . in figures 4e and 4f ,",
    "we have represented @xmath53 ( errors bars ) and @xmath52 ( vertical spacing between the green lines ) for the one - loop and the two - loop interferometers , respectively .",
    "figure 4e shows that the sensitivity of the 3-pulse sensor is limited by the vibration noise not measured by the mas , as @xmath55 . on the contrary , figure 4f reveals that the atomic phase noise is the main limit to the sensitivity of the 4-pulse sensor , as @xmath54 .",
    "the snr in the 4-pulse interferometer is less than in its 3-pulse counterpart as the additional light pulse reduces the interference fringe contrast due to the raman beam intensity inhomogeneities and the transverse temperature of the cloud . in spite of greater atomic noise ,",
    "the quality of the correlation 4f is better than that of correlation 4e , which shows that the 4-pulse sensor operates a vibration noise rejection .    in the 4-pulse geometry ,",
    "the two elementary interferometers operate one after another and share accelerations of frequency below @xmath56 . in a uff test , two ais of equal scale factor ( @xmath57 )",
    "will interrogate two different atoms almost simultaneously , so that the noise rejection is expected to be much more efficient ( see @xcite and the supplementary information ) . in that case",
    ", the precision of the inertial sensor might be limited by the atomic phase noise , i.e. by the snr of the interferometer . for the 3-pulse ai data in figure 4c and 4e ( @xmath58 )",
    ", we estimate a snr of 2.1 , which corresponds to an acceleration sensitivity of the matter wave sensor of @xmath0 , in the context of the high vibration noise rejection expected for the uff test . that sensitivity level may be greatly improved in the future by using a highly collimated atomic source in microgravity @xcite .",
    "we finally discuss possible improvements of our setup , both for inertial guidance and fundamental physics applications . in the former case , increasing the resolution of the accelerometer will be achieved by using well characterized mas to increase @xmath34 , and by improving the snr of the ai .",
    "reaching an interrogation time @xmath59 in the plane ( where the acceleration fluctuations are @xmath60 rms at 1-g ) would require mas whose scale factor frequency response is determined with a relative accuracy of @xmath61 .",
    "we believe that such precision can be achieved with state - of - the - art ma technology , e.g. capacitive mems sensors , and we now work at implementing these sensors in our setup . together with a shot noise limited ai with @xmath62 ( as in @xcite ) , the resolution of the hybrid sensor would be @xmath63 per shot , which would represent a major advance in inertial navigation as well as in airborne gravimetry .",
    "we note that the present analysis does not report the in - flight bias of the matter wave sensor since no other airborne accelerometer of similar accuracy was available onboard to proceed to the comparison .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated in laboratories that atom accelerometers can reach biases of the order of @xmath64 under appropriate conditions @xcite .",
    "tests of fundamental physics would also require performant mas to remove the residual aircraft s or satellite s acceleration noise not rejected in the differential measurement .",
    "for a uff test in the 0-g plane and a vibration rejection efficiency of 300 ( explained in @xcite and in the supplementary information ) , a differential acceleration sensitivity of @xmath65 per shot ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) could be achieved with mas of @xmath61 relative accuracy if the vibrations during the 0-g phase are damped to the @xmath68 level . in space",
    ", high performance mas such as the sensors developped for the goce mission could be used to determine the residual accelerations of the satellite ( @xmath69 ) with a resolution @xcite of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "the vibration rejection efficiency of 300 would thus limit the impact of the acceleration noise on the interferometric measurement to @xmath71 per shot , which would stand for a minor contribution in the error budget .",
    "therefore , high precision test of the equivalence principle could be conducted in space without the strong drag - free constraints on the satellite that represent a major challenge in current space mission proposals .    to conclude",
    ", we have demonstrated the first airborne operation of a cold atom inertial sensor , both at 1-g and in microgravity .",
    "we have shown how the matter wave sensor can measure the craft acceleration with high resolutions .",
    "our approach proposes to use mechanical devices which probe the coarse inertial effects and allow us to enter the fine measurement regime provided by the atom accelerometer . in the future ,",
    "instruments based on the combination of better characterized mechanical sensors and a shot noise limited ai could reach sensitivities of the order of few @xmath72 in one second aboard aircrafts . thus , our investigations indicate that sensors relying on cold atom technology may be able to detect inertial effects with resolutions unreached so far by instruments aboard moving crafts characterized by high acceleration levels .",
    "cold atom sensors offer new perspectives in inertial navigation thanks to their long term stability as they could be used to correct the bias ( @xmath73 ) of the traditional sensors monitoring the crafts motion , below the @xmath72 level . in geophysics ,",
    "airborne gravity surveys may also benefit from the accuracy of ais @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have operated the first matter wave sensor in microgravity .",
    "we have shown how differential interferometer geometries enable to reject vibration noise of the experimental platform where new types of fundamental physics tests will be carried out .",
    "our result in 0-g suggests that the high sensitivity level of matter wave interferometers may be reached on such platforms , and support the promising future of ais to test fundamental physics laws aboard aircrafts , sounding rockets or satellites where long interrogation times can be achieved @xcite .",
    "while many quantum gravity theories predict violations of the uff , ais may investigate its validity at the atomic scale , with accuracies comparable to those of ongoing or future experiments monitoring macroscopic or astronomical bodies @xcite .",
    "for a time varying acceleration @xmath74 of the retroreflecting mirror , the phase of the interferometer at time @xmath22 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the acceleration response of the 3-pulse ai .",
    "it is a triangle - like function @xcite that reads : @xmath77 \\\\   2t-(t-\\tilde{t_i } ) & \\text{if } \\",
    "t \\in [ \\tilde{t_i}+t,\\tilde{t_i}+2 t ] , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath78 being the time of the first raman pulse at the @xmath79-th measurement .",
    "the mean acceleration that we infer is defined as @xmath80 .",
    "thanks to the mas , we estimate the phase @xmath81 which is expected to be measured by the interferometer by averaging in the time domain the signal @xmath20 by the ai response function : @xmath82 the mas - ai correlation function can be written as @xmath83 and expresses the probability to measure the atomic signal @xmath24 at time @xmath31 , given the acceleration signal @xmath20 recorded by the mas . the estimated acceleration used in figure 2",
    "is defined by @xmath84 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have neglected in equation ( 1 ) the raman pulse duration @xmath85 with respect to the interrogation time @xmath46 .",
    "the exact formula can be found in @xcite and has been used in the data analysis to estimate the phase @xmath86 .",
    "we calculate the probability density function ( pdf ) of the ai measurements @xmath24 and fit it with the pdf of a pure sine ( a `` twin - horned '' distribution ) convolved with a gaussian of standard deviation @xmath87 .",
    "the fit function reads : @xmath88^{-1/2 }   \\times \\frac{1}{\\sigma_p\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\text{exp}\\big({-\\frac{(x - x^{\\prime})^2}{2\\sigma_p^2}}\\big),\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is a normalization factor . in this way",
    ", we estimate the amplitude @xmath15 and the offset value @xmath14 of the interference fringes , i.e. we estimate the ai response @xmath90 .",
    "the fitted parameters @xmath15 and @xmath87 provide an estimate of the in - flight signal to noise ratio of the interferometer , given by @xmath91 .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the method for the data used in figure 2 and 3 , corresponding to the interrogation time @xmath92 ms .",
    "the fitted parameters are @xmath93 , @xmath94 and snr@xmath95 .",
    "this method is independent on the mas signal and informs both on the response of the ai , and on its one - shot acceleration sensitivity @xmath96 .",
    "the characteristics of the interferometer are thus known without any additional calibration procedure . in particular",
    ", we can estimate the noise level of the matter wave sensor , given by @xmath97 for a white atomic phase noise , and which equals @xmath98 for the data in figure 5 , where @xmath23 .",
    "our analysis estimates the snr by taking into account only the atomic noise due to detection noise or fluctuations of the fringe offset and contrast .",
    "it does not account for the laser phase noise that could impact the sensitivity of the acceleration measurement for long interrogation times @xcite .",
    "however , we demonstrated the low phase noise of our laser system during previous parabolic flight campaigns @xcite , which is at least one order of magnitude below the estimated atomic phase noise for the interrogation times we consider in this work ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "therefore , we have neglected in this communication the laser phase noise contribution when evaluating the sensitivity of the sensor .",
    "thanks to the mas signal , we first determine the fringe number @xmath100 $ ] where the interferometer operates at time @xmath22 , with @xmath29 being the reciprocity interval of the matter wave sensor .",
    "the values @xmath32 are represented by the black step - like curve in figure 3a .",
    "second , we use the atomic measurements @xmath24 to deduce the acceleration @xmath101 measured by the ai in its reciprocity region @xmath102 $ ] , and given by : @xmath103 the total acceleration @xmath27 is finally computed as :    @xmath104    the acceleration measurement process is illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "the main limitation of the mas comes from the nonlinearities in their frequency response ( phase and gain ) , which means that the signal @xmath20 is not exactly proportional to the acceleration of the retroreflecting mirror .",
    "this results in errors in the estimation of the phase @xmath86 that impair the mas - ai correlation .",
    "the nonlinearities typically reach amplitudes @xmath105 within the ai bandwidth which equals @xmath106 500 hz . ( the acceleration frequency response @xmath107 of an ai has been measured in @xcite and corresponds to the response of a second order low pass filter of cutoff frequency @xmath56 ) . to reduce them ,",
    "we combine two mechanical devices of relatively flat frequency response within two complementary frequency bands : a capacitive accelerometer ( sensorex sx46020 ) sensing the low frequency accelerations ( 0 to 1 hz ) , and a piezoelectric sensor ( imi 626a03 ) measuring the rapid fluctuations ( 1 to 500 hz ) . in this way",
    ", we achieve @xmath108 . for @xmath37 ,",
    "these nonlinearities correspond to errors on @xmath86 of about 0.5 rad rms .",
    "further details on the errors in the estimation of the phase due to the mas nonlinearities are given in the supplementary information .",
    "another limitation comes from the mas internal noise , especially that of the capacitive one whose noise level integrated in [ 0 - 1hz ] equals @xmath109 .",
    "this noise is about one order of magnitude lower than this due to the non - linearities of the mas , and is independent of the acceleration level in the plane .",
    "axis cross - talk of the mas of the order of @xmath110 is taken into account for the estimation of the phase , so that the errors on @xmath86 due to the mas axis coupling are negligible .",
    "finally , the bias of the capacitive accelerometer is specified at the @xmath111 level , so that the mean estimated acceleration might drift during the flight ( 4 hours ) .",
    "this results in a displacement of the dark fringe position in the mas - ai correlation plots .",
