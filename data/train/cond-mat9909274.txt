    "the most interesting case is considered : onsite repulsion ( coulomb force predominance ) and intersite attraction .",
    "the concrete value of onsite repulsion has only a small effect on the character of band structure .",
    "the explanation is clear : two coupled fermions are placed on neighbor sites mostly where attraction dominates and `` do nt feel '' onsite repulsion . on the contrary ,",
    "the value of the intersite attraction is important for the determination of low  lying bands .",
    "this situation has been analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that the gap between the local pair band and the polaron band , that is placed above , increases with the coupling constant when considering onsite attractive hubbard model .",
    "the substitution of the onsite attraction by the intersite one does not affect this qualitative result .",
    "fig.1 represents band structure of the singlet and triplet pairs at definite values of s - wave and p - wave attraction .",
    "the choice of the attraction value @xmath141 and @xmath142 gives reasonable mass of local pairs .",
    "it becomes evident that the band structure is not as simple as in the standard 1-site attractive hubbard model .",
    "there are additional gaps between the singlet and triplet bands , along with large ordinary gap .",
    "each of the singlet and triplet band in its turn is splitted into two subbands .",
    "this could explain those contradictions that seem take place in determination of the gap value from different experiments .",
    "a one  particle ( polaron ) band is lying higher with the energy of its bottom being equal @xmath143 .",
    "it is necessary now to normalize our relative units .",
    "an appropriate value of a polaron bandwidth is about 50 - 100mev .",
    "the undimentional polaron bandwidth is equal 4 in the units that were used throughout the paper .",
    "it means that our energy unit is about @xmath144 , the chosen value of the intersite attraction is @xmath145 , that seems reasonable .",
    "the value of the gap between the lowest local pair energy and lowest polaron energy depends strictly on the sort of pairing .",
    "thus , in the case presented in fg.1 , the gapwidth between polaron band and s - pair band is about @xmath146    another interesting conclusion concerns a mass of the local pairs . according to the wide - spread point of view the local pair mass should be large enough this being considered as a shortcoming of local pair theories .",
    "our calculations demonstrate ( see fig.1 ) , that the situation is more favorable : the width of the lowest singlet band is only 3 - 4 times smaller , than the width of the fermion band .",
    "it gives the mass of the local pair @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the effective fermion mass .",
    "one can notice finally , that the triplet pairs appear to be several times heavier than the singlet ones for this set of parameters .",
    "the excitation spectra and the local pair structure studied above may be used for theoretical investigation of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the systems with the strongly interacting electrons . on the other hand",
    "there are many experiments dealing with the interaction of htsc materials with different external fields . for the theoretical explanation of these experiments one has to know the form of the interaction of the pairs with the external fields .",
    "the corresponding vertex functions should be obviously dependent on the internal structure of the coupled state .",
    "the interaction of the fermion with the external field presented in eq.([e1 ] ) for the hamiltonian is of rather general form .",
    "it includes , for example , the interaction with neutrons and electromagnetic field . by integrating over the grassman variables in the same way as it was done before",
    ", one can obtain the action in the form ( [ e4 ] ) , with the matrix @xmath149 depending on the external field : @xmath150 in eq.([matry ] ) all matrices are written in the momentum representation and an imaginary  time  fourier ",
    "transformation is assumed . expanding this expression up to the second order in the fields @xmath151 and to the first order in the ( weak )",
    "field @xmath13 , one can obtain the effective action for the local pairs in the external field :    @xmath152    here the summation on the repeated indices is assumed .",
    "eq.([e9 ] ) and the orthonormal basis ( [ setx ] ) were used in the derivation of this equation .",
    "the vertex @xmath153 has the form : @xmath154 here the formfactor @xmath155 depends only on the structure of the coupled state .",
    "the external field is written in the more convenient form  with the spin index extracted and translational invariance taken into account : @xmath156 . as it was mentioned above , the vertex of the interaction of pairs with the external field depends on the frequency , the wave vector of the external field and the wave functions of the fermion pairs .",
    "one can see that the slowly varying field is not sensitive to the pair structure .",
    "a simple test shows that in this case the vertex of the singlet local pair interaction with the external field equals to zero . for the triplet pairs",
    "it is twice the interaction of the fermion with the field .",
    "the behavior of formfactor ( [ formfac ] ) plays a significant role in the theoretical explanation of experiments on the scattering of particles on the local pairs . for example , at low temperatures and small transferred momenta the transitions appear to be suppressed .",
    "the reason is quite obvious : at the low temperature the local pairs being bosons are condensed at the lowest level with the momenta @xmath157 .",
    "the transitions into the upper bands with approximately the same momentum are suppressed due to the orthogonality of the wave functions with different energies : @xmath158 .",
    "the typical formfactors of the transitions from the lowest singlet band to the upper singlet or triplet one are presented in fig.2 .",
    "there is also the formfactor describing the transitions inside the lowest singlet band .",
    "the transitions into the second triplet band are forbidden for chosen transferred momenta @xmath159 due to the orthogonality of the wave functions .",
    "the evident momentum dependence of the formfactor confirms its importance in the interpretation of experiments .",
    "the mathematics of the local pair theory was developed .",
    "the _ ad hoc _ calculation of band structure of the local pairs and their interaction with external fields are presented here .",
    "it is shown that numerical calculations based on analytical formulas and being relatively simple lead to exact qualitative predictions .",
    "the method can be easily generalized .",
    "the momentum dependency of the vertex is essential for theoretical explanation of experiments .",
