    "globular clusters , densely packed groups of old stars , can efficiently produce close stellar binaries by dynamical interactions of their member stars .",
    "examples for such dynamically formed binaries include low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cataclysmic variables @xcite and milli - second pulsars ( mspsrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most extreme binaries found in globular clusters consist of two neutron stars @xcite .",
    "mergers of such binaries are believed to be the central engine of short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , that produce brief , intense flashes of ionising radiation .",
    "in contrast to short bursts , long bursts are believed to originate from the death of short - lived massive stars ( see * ? ? ? * for a review on long and short bursts ) .",
    "it has been argued that the rate of short grbs in the local universe is dominated by the merger of neutron star binaries formed in globular clusters @xcite . a link between globular clusters and short grbs",
    "is further supported by the presence of a short grb remnant candidate in the galactic globular cluster terzan  5 @xcite , observed in the very - high energy gamma - ray @xcite , x - ray @xcite and radio wave band @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for the grb - globular cluster connection comes from spatial offsets of short grbs from their host galaxies @xcite and the redshift distribution of such events @xcite .",
    "since globular clusters follow well - defined orbits around the galaxy @xcite , their coupling with grbs allows us to examine the long - standing question of the past history of gamma - ray flux on the earth .",
    "( a similar approach for supernovae exploding in star clusters has been used in @xcite ) .",
    "numerous studies have shown that gamma rays from supernovae ( sne ) or grbs could , in principle , have had a significant impact on the earth s atmosphere and biosphere , potentially even contributing to mass extinctions ( see @xcite for the affect of grbs in general , and @xcite for the affect of merger - induced bursts ) . however , demonstrating that sne or grbs may in fact have played some role first requires identifying that sources could have come near enough to the earth at some point .",
    "some previous studies have attempted to make a connection between the solar motion relative to the galactic plane or spiral arms , on the assumption that the gamma ray flux incident on the earth is larger in these regions of enhanced massive star formation rate and/or increased stellar density ( see @xcite for a review ) . however",
    ", a recent study shows that the flux from these sources as modulated by the plausible solar motion over the past 550myr has a poor correlation with the variation of the extinction rate on the earth ( feng & bailer - jones , submitted ) .",
    "indeed , it seems that astronomical phenomena alone are unlikely to be the dominant driver of biological evolution or the cause of all ( or even most ) mass extinctions . nonetheless , if a grb were to explode near to the earth , its consequences could be catastrophic , and globular clusters are presumably a significant source of grbs .",
    "the goal of this paper is to reconstruct the orbits of globular clusters relative to the sun in order to calculate the grb flux at the earth as a function of time , and thereby to identify potential candidate clusters .",
    "the data for this orbital reconstruction comes from the positions , distance , proper motion and radial velocity catalogues of globular clusters of @xcite , from which we obtain the current galactic coordinates and space velocities . by sampling over the ( often significant ) uncertainties in the reconstructed orbits of the globular clusters and the sun , we infer the expected grb flux as a function of time .",
    "this allows us to identify the most probable intervals in the earth s history of a significantly increased gamma ray flux , which may ( or may not ) be associated with times of higher extinction rate .    in section  [ method :",
    "orbits ] we describe the orbital reconstruction method , and in section  [ method : summing ] we explain how we derive from this the probability distribution over the past cluster  sun separation and the expected gamma ray flux at the earth . this takes into account the different grb rates in the clusters , which is derived in section  [ method : weighting ] .",
    "we give our results in section  [ sec : results ] where we also identify some past extinction events .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with an outlook on how to further this work .",
    "we trace the orbits of the sun and the globular clusters back in time by integrating the equations of motion through the galactic potential . in a purely gravitational system",
    "there is no dissipation of energy , so the dynamics are reversible .",
    "we adopt an analytic , three component , axisymmetric potential , @xmath0 , comprising the galactic bulge , halo and disk @xmath1 the bulge and halo are represented with a plummer distribution @xmath2 in which the characteristic length scales are @xmath3kpc for the bulge and @xmath4kpc for the halo , and the bulge and halo masses are @xmath5m@xmath6 and @xmath7m@xmath6 respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the radial coordinate perpendicular to the axis , and @xmath9 is the distance from the galactic plane . for the disk we use the potential from @xcite @xmath10 with the values @xmath11m@xmath6 for the disk mass , and @xmath12kpc and @xmath13kpc for the scale length and scale height of the disk ,",
    "respectively ( after @xcite ) .",
    "the integration is performed numerically from the present back to 550myr bp ( before present ) .",
    "this time limit is chosen because it corresponds to the beginning of the phanerozoic eon , a time from which the fossil record becomes more indicative of biodiversity variations . the globular clusters ( and sun )",
    "are treated as massless .",
    "the initial conditions for the integration are the current phase space coordinates ( three position and three velocity components ) of the globular clusters ( and sun ) .",
    "these of course have significant uncertainties , each represented as a gaussian with known mean ( measured coordinate ) and standard deviation ( estimated uncertainty ) .",
    "these come from dana casetti - dinescu s catalogue for globular cluster s three - dimensional space velocities ( 2012 version ) for the globular clusters , and from hipparcos data by @xcite for the sun .",
    "we further use a distance of the sun to the galactic center obtained from astrometric and spectroscopic observations of the stars near the supermassive black hole of the galaxy @xcite and the displacement of the sun from the galactic plane is calculated from the photometric observations of classical cepheids by @xcite . rather than just performing a single integration for each object ( cluster or sun ) , we monte carlo sample its initial conditions from the uncertainty distribution in order to build up a large sample of orbits .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbits_1 ] shows an example of such sample orbits for one globular cluster , 47tuc , by plotting the distance of the cluster from the sun over time .",
    "( we sample over the possible orbits of the sun too . )",
    "we do not take into account the ( possibly significant ) uncertainties in the galactic potential .",
    "in principle we could adopt an uncertainty model for these parameters and marginalize over them also .",
    "but we choose to omit this in this first investigation .",
    "finally we have to note that compact binaries may be ejected from their parent cluster before they merge and produce a grb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect will smear out the distribution of compact binaries around the producing cluster .",
    "the typical escape velocities for massive globular clusters are about 50kms@xmath14 , which is comparable to the present uncertainties of the globular cluster velocity .",
    "although over time the orbit of the ejected binary could deviate considerably from its parent cluster , the uncertainty in its orbit is comparable to the uncertainty for its parent cluster , which we take into account .",
    "we therefore choose to omit the issue of ejected grb progenitors for this first investigation .",
    "furthermore , more massive clusters are better able to retain their binaries , and these are the clusters that preferentially produce grbs ( see sec . [",
    "method : weighting ] ) .          for a given globular cluster , @xmath15",
    ", we convert the set of ( thousands of ) relative orbits into a two - dimensional density distribution over time , @xmath16 , and separation , @xmath17 , using kernel density estimation .",

    "cluster separation over time , @xmath18 , which is normalized such that @xmath19 for all @xmath16 and for each cluster .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fcrt_1 ] for 47tuc , in which the probability density is plotted as a grey scale . at any",
    "given time , the darker the band , the more concentrated the probability is around a smaller range of distances .",
    "the width of the distribution at any time is determined by how the uncertainties in the present coordinates of both globular cluster and sun propagate back in time .",
    "the density estimates for some other globular clusters are shown in figures  [ fig : fcrt_4][fig : fcrt_55 ] .",
    "the flux of a gamma ray burst at the sun is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "multiplying @xmath18 by @xmath20 , and assuming that gamma ray bursts occur at random times , we get a 2d distribution which is proportional to the expected grb flux from distance @xmath17 at time @xmath16 .",
    "if we integrate this ( at a time @xmath16 ) over all distances then we get a quantity , @xmath21 , which is proportional to the expected grb flux from that globular ( at time @xmath16 ) .",
    "the important thing about this quantity is that it takes into account the uncertainties in the reconstructed globular cluster and solar orbits .",
    "we now extend this concept to the complete set of globular clusters .",
    "each cluster has a different probability per unit time of producing a grb , proportional to the factor @xmath22 , defined in section  [ method : weighting ] .",
    "we can then see that the quantity @xmath23 is proportional to the expected grb flux at the sun at time @xmath16 from any globular cluster . in principle",
    "we integrate up to @xmath24 , but in practice we can truncate it to a few kpc . indeed ,",
    "if there is a minimum flux threshold below which the gamma ray flux is too small to have any significant affect on the earth s biosphere or climate , then truncation is appropriate .",

    "this scale is normalized such that the integration over @xmath17 at each @xmath16 is unity.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    observationally , the frequency of occurrence of grbs in individual globular cluster is not known .",
    "the dynamical formation of compact binaries , proposed progenitors of such events , is rather complex , involving at least two stellar encounters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the rate of grbs in each globular cluster is expected to be linked to the cluster properties .",
    "several authors have already investigated the dependence of the compact binary formation rate on the characteristics of the clusters .",
    "@xcite found that the formation of close double neutron star binaries depends on the square of the cluster density , and that the number of retained neutron stars increases as the escape velocity ( and thus cluster mass ) increases .",
    "@xcite used a model where the formation of double neutron star binaries scales linearly with the neutron star number density , the velocity dispersion ( and thus mass of the cluster ) and the number of potential progenitor systems ( binaries containing one neutron star ) .",
    "both models find that massive clusters with a high concentration of stars strongly favour the formation of prospective grb progenitor systems . here",
    "we adopt a similar approach to these previous works and scale the expected grb rate with quantities that are known for a large sample of globular clusters .    specifically , assuming that grbs are caused by neutron star encounters , then the grb rate will depend on the number of neutron stars in the cluster and their encounter rate .",
    "we assume that the number of neutron stars scales linearly with the mass of the globular cluster , @xmath26 , and thus linearly also with the cluster luminosity .",
    "the total encounter rate , @xmath27 , is given as @xmath28 @xcite , where @xmath29 is the central stellar number density and @xmath30 is the core radius of the globular cluster .",
    "values for these parameters for our sample of clusters we obtained from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) . combining these two factors",
    "we get a quantity @xmath31 , which is proportional to the frequency of gamma rays bursts in the clusters , and is used as the weighting factor in section  [ method : summing ] . accordingly , and as already noted in the beginning of this section , massive clusters with high concentrations of stars at their center have a large grb rate .",
    "we investigated the uncertainties of our approach by applying an alternative weighting scheme for individual globular clusters .",
    "we followed @xcite and adopted weights proportional to @xmath32 . with this approach we found that the typical uncertainties for the leading clusters is a factor of a few , with a few notable exceptions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) . for the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we use the weights @xmath33 as defined earlier in this section .",
    "having calculated the indivdual weights , @xmath33 , they are then normalised such that the sum of all weights equals 1 . here",
    "we used 141 clusters from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) where all necessary parameters are known .",
    "this , in principle , further allows us to estimate the expected absolute grb rates for individual globular clusters by defining that a weight of 1 corresponds to the galactic rate of grbs launched in globular clusters .",
    "this galactic grb rate can be calculated from the short grb rate in the local universe of @xmath34gpc@xmath35yr@xmath14 @xcite and the density of milky way - type galaxies of 0.01 mpc@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this rate is obtained for grbs beamed towards earth and is thus independent of the degree of collimation of the events .",

    "47tuc is the dominant globular cluster in our study for both weighting schemes .",
    "* ngc1851 contains a mspsr in a very eccentric binary system with massive secondary @xcite .",

    "this could account for about 5% ( 0.3% ) of grbs from globular clusters .",
    "* omegacen is the most massive globular cluster in the galaxy , detected by _ fermi - lat _ @xcite .",
    "this could account for about 2% ( 10@xmath35% ) of grbs from globular clusters .",
    "for this globular cluster the two different weighting schemes give the largest difference since it is a very massive cluster with a shallow density profile .",
    "* m13 contains five radio - detected mspsrs @xcite .",
    "this could account for about 0.2% ( 10@xmath35% ) of grbs from globular clusters .",
    "* m15 has a double neutron - star binary that will merge within a hubble time @xcite , eight radio - detected mspsrs @xcite .",
    "this could account for about 6% ( 2% ) of grbs from globular clusters .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "grbs are of course discrete , rare events . indeed , our calculations suggest that only about 10 grbs will have occurred within 5kpc of the sun over the course of the phanerozoic .",
    "thus the _ true _ distribution of flux with time would comprise of a series of narrow peaks of various heights .",
    "8 shows the _ expected _ flux at time ( times a constant ) , so is the best single estimate of that distribution .    by way of comparison",
    "we overplot in figure  [ fig : dwcipd ] the times of 18 mass extinction events on the earth revealed by the fossil record , as compiled by @xcite .",

    "so the probability that at least one of the 18 events coincides with such a box just by chance is @xmath43 .",
    "this is not a proper hypothesis test , but it highlights that a coincidence is quite likely . ]",
    "it is nonetheless worthwhile identifying those events nearest to the three peaks .",
    "these are    * peak at 70myr : the famous kt extinction at 65myrbp , generally accepted to have had a significant role in the demise of the dinosaurs ; * peak at 180myr : the late pliensbachian / early toarcian ( early jurrasic ) extinction event at 179186myrbp ; * peak at 340myr : the early serpukhovian ( mid carboniferous ) extinction event at 322326myrbp , and the late famennian ( late devonian ) extinction event at 359364 myr bp .    whether or not a globular cluster grb is implicated in any of these extinctions",
    "remains a subject for future work .",
    "in this paper we have traced globular cluster orbits back to the beginning of the phanerozoic eon in order to identify time intervals where a high flux of ionizing radiation caused by a nearby grb is more likely .",
    "we found that the probability for such an event is far from flat with time during the earth s history .",
    "it instead exhibits several distinct peaks , the most prominent ones being around 70 , 180 and 340myr bp .",
    "the main source of grbs in all cases is 47tuc .",
    "all three time intervals can in principle be associated with a mass extinction event , although a chance coincidence is likely .",
    "therefore , to establish a link between a nearby grb and an impact on the earth and its biota , supporting geological signatures are needed .",
    "geological signatures could comprise radiation damage of crystals ( e.g. fossil cosmic ray tracks @xcite or color shifts @xcite ) , deposition of radioactive isotopes @xcite or elevated rates of bone cancer @xcite .",
    "the time intervals identified in this paper can be used as a guide - line to search for such signatures in the geological record .    finally , the current orbital parameters of globular clusters and the solar system are subject to considerable uncertainties .",
    "( these were taken into account in our analysis , and contribute to smearing out the probability curve . )",
    "this situation will be substantially improved in the near future with the launch of the gaia satellite , which will determine the dynamics of the galaxy with unprecedented accuracy . with better determined orbital parameters we will be able to constrain the past orbits more tightly , and so repeat this study to give results of higher confidence ."
