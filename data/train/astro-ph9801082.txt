    "in core  collapse supernovae , neutrinos are arguably the engines of explosion @xcite and the best direct probe of its internal workings @xcite .",
    "to understand the supernova phenomenon , a theorist requires knowledge of the equation of state of nuclear matter , stellar evolution , general relativity , statistical physics , and the techniques of radiative transfer and hydrodynamics .",
    "however , the opacities and sources of neutrinos of all the six known neutrino species take center stage in this context in which the neutrino  optical \" depth down to the protoneutron star core varies from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , neutrino luminosities can approach @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 , and photons , the traditional agents of radiative energy transfer in astrophysics , are profoundly trapped .",
    "this seems to be a unique role for neutrinos in the universe .",
    "since neutrinos are abundantly produced , yet are the most mobile of a collapsed core s constituents , their microphysics determines the outcome of core collapse , neutron star and black hole formation , nucleosynthesis at and beyond the iron peak @xcite , early pulsar kinematics @xcite , and , perhaps , the asymmetries observed in supernova debris clouds @xcite .    in the neutrino",
    " driven mechanism , neutrinos liberated from the core heat matter in the inner stellar envelope ( the outer protoneutron star envelope ) as they emerge . if the total heating rate is sufficient , the envelope becomes unstable and is ejected .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that neutrino  driven convection in this inner mantle can make this process more efficient ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , neutrinos mediate the energy transfer from the core to the mantle and their luminosities and spectra are crucial to the viablility and character of the explosion mechanism .",
    "these in turn are a function of the neutrino ",
    "matter opacities .    while at low mass densities ( @xmath7 gm @xmath8 ) neutrino ",
    "matter cross sections are well  understood and characterized @xcite , at the higher densities achieved in core collapse the inter ",
    "particle spacings are smaller than the wavelength of the ambient neutrinos and many ",
    "body effects and particle  particle correlations must be taken into account .",
    "ion correlations due to coulomb interactions have been addressed in the supernova context ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) and their effects , though interesting , have been shown to be small and transient @xcite . however , near and above nuclear densities ( @xmath9 gm @xmath8 ) neutrinos with energies below @xmath101000 mev  see \" many nucleons and collective effects must be considered .",
    "in fact , these effects can radically alter the opacity of nuclear matter to neutrinos , since the nuclear force introduces strong correlations near and above nuclear densities .",
    "body effects have been discussed before in the protoneutron star and supernova context ( _ cf .",
    "_ , @xcite ) , but the results were either too approximate or of too  limited scope .",
    "pauli blocking by final ",
    "state nucleons , a type of correlation , has been a component of supernova and protoneutron star thinking for some time @xcite , but the approximate treatments employed at high densities can be off by large factors (  vi.b ) .",
    "furthermore , in the case of neutrino  nucleon scattering , the assumption that the scattering is elastic @xcite and that the nucleons are stationary can be shown to result in errors in the energy transfer of as much as a factor of ten .",
    "a consequence of this is that energy equilibration of @xmath0 and @xmath1 neutrinos is brought about not by the @xmath11 process or neutrino  electron scattering , but by neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering .",
    "this result , one by - product of this study , has also been found by hannestad & raffelt @xcite and in the pioneering work of reddy _ et al .",
    "the latter have conducted the most complete exploration of high  density neutrino opacities to date , taking care to calculate them in a manner consistent with a reasonable nuclear equation of state ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some of our results and formalism recapitulate theirs .",
    "however , reddy _",
    "@xcite neglected particle  particle and spin  spin correlations and focussed on the kinematic effects of nuclear interactions .",
    "we find that the effect of many  body correlations on neutrino ",
    "matter cross sections can be quite large . nuclear matter is more  transparent \" to neutrinos than we had heretofore imagined .",
    "neutrinos interact with nucleons via both charged  current and neutral  current processes .",
    "the charged  current processes predominate for the electron - type neutrinos by a few factors , while the neutral current predominates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 neutrinos .",
    "the latter carry away more than 50% of the binding energy of the neutron star .",
    "we have found that at the high densities achieved in collapse , both the charged  current and the neutral  current cross sections are dramatically affected by nuclear correlation effects . in this paper , we focus on neutral  current neutrino  nucleon scattering , both the fermi and the gamow  teller parts , and defer a discussion of the charged  current many ",
    "body effects to a later paper .",
    "our formalism is good for any degree of nucleon degeneracy and fully incorporates the effects of reaction kinetics , pauli blocking , and correlations due to interactions .",
    "energy transfers both to and from the nucleons are consistently included .",
    "one product of this paper is a formalism for calculating in full the dynamic structure functions for neutrino",
    " nucleon processes .    the effect of increased transparency at high densities on the neutrino  driven mechanism of core ",
    "collapse supernovae is not yet clear .",
    "supernova theory is notorious for its mitigating feedbacks and false leads .",
    "the early ( @xmath12 milliseconds ) neutrino luminosities and spectra depend upon the material in the outer shocked mantle of the protoneutron star , where we think we understand neutrino cross sections . as a consequence",
    ", we do nt expect that our understanding of this early phase will be altered by the new opacities .",
    "even if it could be shown that neutrino cross sections at the lower densities around the neutrinospheres and near the shock were in some non  trivial sense different , increased transparency would lead to an increased rate of collapse of the mantle , which , in turn , would lead to higher densities , which would partially quench the effect .",
    "the corrections to the scattering rates we address in this paper are more relevant at later times ( @xmath13 milliseconds ) , for it is then that the emergent luminosities are powered by the energy in the dense core . at this time , since most of the core pressure is derived from the cold , stiff nuclear component , and not an ideal gas of non  interacting nucleons , the effective specific heat is not negative , but positive , and cooling does not lead to much of a density change .",
    "therefore , the effect of a decrease in opacity will not be partially cancelled by a density increase and the emergent luminosities will reflect the full suppression effects . since the neutrino luminosity is the agency of explosion",
    ", this could be important for a model in which the delay to explosion is not short .",
    "there is an important caveat : accretion of the infalling envelope is a major power source and its continuance can mask the effects of the alterations we find in the neutrino opacities at depth .",
    "accretion will be less important for the lower  mass progenitor stars ( @xmath14 ) , which have more tenuous envelopes .",
    "in addition , the neutrino signals observed from sn1987a @xcite constrain the magnitude of any alteration in our standard model , as does the fact that there is a fixed amount of energy to be radiated from any given protoneutron star . in this paper , to gauge these effects and to begin the debate on these issues , we perform an idealized protoneutron star cooling calculation .    in ",
    "ii , we explain the physics of the correlation effects and provide a simple , single  channel , model that makes clear the character of the results . in  iii ,",
    "the general formulation is presented , as is an aside on the low ",
    "wavelength limit . in ",
    "iv , the complete correlation and dynamic structure function formalism is derived and discussed and a straightforward nucleon potential model is described . in reality , the solution of the problem of the nuclear equation of state goes hand  in  hand with the calculation of many",
    " body correlations .",
    "since we are not proposing here to resolve the former , we are satisfied with a model that captures the essence of the nuclear interaction . different nuclear equations of state will yield quantitatively , but not qualitatively , different results . in ",
    "v , we outline our multi  channel formalism for calculating @xmath15nucleon scattering structure functions and in  vi we present the results of our calculations for various temperatures , densities , and neutrino energies . in  ii through  vi , we start from the general expressions of statistical mechanics that encompass the effects of the medium on the neutral  current neutrino reactions and proceed to calculations of the effects . in  vii",
    ", we present the results of a suggestive series of calculations that might point to the astrophysical import of the new effects and in  viii we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we can introduce , and qualitatively explain , much of what is to come in a simplified system in which we have just one species of non - relativistic nucleon with mass @xmath16 , which is coupled to neutrinos through only a vector neutral current .",
    "we take the weak  interaction lagrangean density to be ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the density operator for the nucleons , @xmath19 is the weak coupling constant , and the other symbols have their standard field  theoretic meanings . in the following ,",
    "we employ a system of units in which @xmath20 .",

    "thus , in the limit of heavy nucleons , when we integrate the differential rate ( [ b2 ] ) over a range of @xmath27s the other factors in the integrand can be evaluated at @xmath41 .",
    "we can express this limit as ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the _",

    "if the medium is comprised of heavy enough nucleons , we need only the static structure function defined in ( [ b6 ] ) , then given by    @xmath51    in other words , @xmath43 is merely the fourier transform of the thermally  averaged density  density correlation function .",
    "this is the classic result that scattering off of a medium is in reality scattering off of the _ fluctuations _ in that medium . also of interest is the long  wavelength limit , @xmath52 , justified when the neutrino wavelength is much bigger than the interparticle separation .",
    "statistical mechanics provides two useful and equivalent expressions for the long  wavelength limit , @xmath53 , the first @xcite in terms of the isothermal compressibility of the medium @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the ideal gas compressibility and @xmath58 is the average nucleon density , and the second ( _ ibid .",

    "these limits are the least justified for the case of trapped electron neutrinos in the early dense core , where the momentum transfers in neutrino scattering are comparable to the inverse particle spacing .    in the present work we address these deficiencies by using methods that incorporate all of the physics of the above discussion and previously cited papers , but which calculate the dynamic structure factor as a function of ( @xmath76 ) and do the integrals over the neutrino variables , without further approximation .",

    "nevertheless , the reader should be cautioned that these conclusions await a more thoughtful implementation of these new neutrino opacities and that the calculations depicted in figure  [ fig11 ] are merely suggestive .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a consistent formalism for calculating the fermi and gamow  teller structure functions in nuclear matter , including many  body correlations and the full kinematics of neutrino  nucleon scattering .",
    "previously all but ignored , the effects of density  density and spin  spin correlations on neutrino scattering rates are found to be significant . above nuclear density ,",
    "the total cross section suppression factor due to final  state nucleon blocking , correlations , and a reduction in the nucleon effective mass can be more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the upshot is that supernova cores are more transparent than previously thought .",
    "since the many  body corrections to the charged  current rates for the @xmath2s have yet to be published , in this paper we conclude only that the total opacities of nuclear matter to @xmath0s and @xmath1s ( and their anti ",
    "particles ) are qualitatively altered .",
    "the magnitude of the rate corrections due to many  body effects increases with density , decreases with temperature , and is roughly independent of incident neutrino energy .",
    "in addition , we find that the neutrino ",
    "matter energy transfer rates due to neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering are much larger than heretofore assumed . as a consequence , energy equilibration for the non  electron  type neutrino species may well be by what was previously considered an elastic process .",
    "this obtains even for free nucleons at high densities , but is all the more true with many ",
    "body effects included .",
    "an identifiable part of the energy transfer enhancement comes from the excitation of collective modes in the matter , modes akin to the gamow  teller and giant dipole resonances in nuclei .",
    "energy is transferred by the erenkov mechanism to or from these modes when the energy transfer ( @xmath270 ) and momentum transfer ( @xmath29 ) satisfy the dispersion relation of the medium s excitations ( zero sound and spin sound , both of which require repulsive interactions ) .    under the assumption that both the charged  current and the neutral current cross sections are decreased , we calculated a set of ad hoc protoneutron star cooling models to gauge the importance of the new opacities to the supernova itself . while the early luminosities are not altered , the luminosities after many hundreds of milliseconds to seconds can be altered by factors that range from 10% to 100% .",
    "such factors may have a bearing on the efficacy of the neutrino  driven supernova mechanism , the delay to explosion , the energy of the explosion , and the strength and relative role of convective overturn .",
    "the magnitude of the relative enhancement of the driving luminosity is a function of the post  bounce mass accretion rates and may be larger for the least massive , massive stars .",
    "hence , these new opacities may be more germane to the terminal behavior of the massive stars most favored by the imf .",
    "it remains to derive the effects of correlations on the charged  current rates , as well as to develop a simple algorithm for incorporating these effects into supernova and protoneutron star codes , with full energy redistribution . since many ",
    "body effects at the highest densities are quite large , a non  perturbative approach may need to be developed for the deep interiors . furthermore , the structure function calculations should be done in a manner fully consistent with the equation of state employed , since the physics of the two are inextricably linked .    if we find that there is indeed an across  the  board reduction in the neutrino ",
    "matter rates at high densities , it will be yet another reminder that the keys to the supernova puzzle and its systematics lie not in any one realm of expertise ( radiative transfer , hydrodynamics , the equation of state , the weak interaction , etc . ) , but in all , and that the 20% effects we seek under lamp posts might at times divert us from discovering those far larger just a few steps down the street .",
