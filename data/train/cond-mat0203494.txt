    "the quantum mechanics of classically chaotic systems , often called quantum chaos , is by now a highly developed subject with an enormous literature , including monographs by gutzwiller  @xcite , stckmann  @xcite , and haake  @xcite , among others .",
    "the subject has been greatly advanced , as is usual , by detailed analyses of simple model systems such as kicked rotors , quantum flows on surfaces of constant negative curvature , harper models , and so on .",
    "some of the central problems that have been studied using these models include those of : ( 1 ) finding explanations for the efficacy of random matrix theories , ( 2 ) understanding the differences between quantum and classical transport , especially when anderson localization plays a role in the quantum system , ( 3 ) studying the properties of quantum systems in the semi - classical limit , and ( 4 ) determining the role of decoherence in producing classically chaotic behavior of a quantum system as planck s constant tends to zero .",
    "the present paper treats the quantum versions of simple model systems , multibaker maps , that have been used to study transport phenomena in classically chaotic systems .",
    "a  multibaker map consists of a chain of two - dimensional baker maps which are interconnected by means of a simple change in the baker dynamics . in the usual baker map on a unit square or torus ,",
    "two vertical strips are stretched ( by a factor of two ) in the horizontal direction , contracted ( by a factor of two ) in the vertical direction , and the resulting horizontal strips are placed one above the other , in order to reconstruct the unit square . in the multibaker chain ,",
    "each of the two horizontal rectangles are sent to adjacent cells , one to the right and the other to the left  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multi1 ] ) .",
    "modified multibaker chains have also been studied where there may be more strips and/or a more complicated dynamics including both area preserving and area non - preserving dynamics .",
    "these classical models provide simple , deterministic models of one dimensional random - walk processes with both diffusive transport and chaotic dynamics .",
    "they have been used to study connections between transport properties such as transport coefficients , and irreversible entropy production , and the chaotic properties of the models  @xcite .",
    "quantum versions of baker maps are well known and studied in some detail for a range of values of planck s constant . here",
    "we add a mechanism for transport of probability amplitudes along a one dimensional chain of quantum baker maps .",
    "this quantum version of the multibaker map ( qmb ) provides one realization of a quantum random walk process . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the `` most quantum '' version of the qmb , obtained by using the largest possible value of planck s constant @xmath1 , in the weyl quantization of the ordinary baker map  @xcite .",
    "our goal here will be to explore the transport properties of the qmb for this value of @xmath2 , and for two different versions of the model , obtained by taking advantage of some phase - related arbitrariness in the quantization of the map .",
    "later papers will explore further properties of qmb s including the semi - classical case , not considered here  @xcite .",
    "area - preserving maps on torus admit a two - parameter family of weyl quantizations  @xcite , where the two parameters can be chosen to be phases .",
    "one can think of the two phases as offsets of lattice points that define the spatial and momentum coordinates of the map .",
    "if we choose the same phases in each unit cell of the chain , we have a `` uniform '' qmb .",
    "if we choose random phases from cell to cell , we obtain a `` random '' qmb .",
    "the different versions have quite different properties , as one might expect .",
    "the uniform qmb has many features in common with those of continuous one - dimensional systems with periodic potential , including extended eigenstates , and ballistic transport , while the random case exhibits the usual phenomena associated with localization . nevertheless , there are some interesting surprises , as we shall see in further sections , associated with transport in open systems .",
    "there are a number of formulations of quantum random walks already in the literature .",
    "we mention , in particular , work of aharonov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , work of godoy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and work of barra and gaspard @xcite . the papers of godoy and co - authors as well as that of barra and gaspard have interesting parallels with ours .",
    "these authors consider the motion of a quantum particle along a one - dimensional , periodic chain of scattering sites .",
    "the scattering sites are characterized by transmission and reflection amplitudes , which for a periodic system , are taken to be the same for each site .",
    "godoy and co - workers consider the wave functions for their systems at discrete positions and discrete times , and propose a set of equations similar to the ones considered here .",
    "these equations are then solved using stationary phase approximations , and the connections with landauer s formula are discussed , for various parameters and particle statistics .",
    "barra and gaspard also consider a model similar to ours , and they analyze the scattering resonances for a finite , open system . by applying transfer and @xmath3 matrices , they obtain expressions for the widths of resonances and the wigner time delay , as functions of the system size .",
    "their equations are in fact quite similar to ours , and a number of results differ in the two cases only because of the differences in the details of the model studied .",
    "their model has two channels per cell ( particles moving to the left or right ) but the particles can have a wide range of energies , and in some instances the high - energy limit is considered . the similarities with the work of godoy _ et al .",
    "_ occur because the version of the quantum multibaker model considered in the present paper is the simplest possible , while more complicated versions , to be considered in further papers have no direct counterparts in their work .",
    "despite the similarities between our work and that of other authors , the focus of the work mentioned above generally differs from ours .",
    "we are particularly interested in comparing and contrasting quantum and classical multibaker maps , and in generalizing the qmb in a number of directions .",
    "these include an examination of the behavior of the qmb for smaller values of @xmath2 including the semi - classical limit , and looking for traces , if any , of the chaotic classical behavior in the quantum version .",
    "the present paper is designed to identify important quantum phenomena that differ from those of the classical multibaker at large @xmath2 , but which are expected to approach the classical results as the planck s constant , @xmath4 , tends to zero .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : class_mb ] we will define the classical version of the model and study the evolution of piecewise constant probability densities . in section  [ sec : quant_mb ]",
    "we quantize the multibaker map using weyl quantization .",
    "there we will define the uniform and random qmb s and obtain expressions for the time dependent propagator appearing in the discrete time version of schrdinger s equation . in section  [ sec : regular ] we describe the behavior of the uniform qmb for @xmath5 .",
    "we find the eigenstates for both closed and open systems , as well as the steady state solutions for systems with particle reservoirs at their boundaries .",
    "we then consider the transport properties of particles in these chains .",
    "of particular interest in this connection is our finding that for open chains of uniform multibakers , and with absorbing boundary conditions , the escape of particles from the chain is _ sub - diffusive _ despite the ballistic transport of particles from the interior of the chain to its boundaries .",
    "we then turn to a brief discussion of the properties of random multibakers and show that the assumption of random phases leads to localized wavefunctions with very different properties from the uniform case .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the classical multibaker map provides a reversible , deterministic realization of a one - dimensional random walk .",

    "the probability current through the boundary between cells @xmath99 and @xmath283 is given by @xmath284 and @xmath285 implies non - vanishing current .",
    "while such currents can arise in principle one expects they should be negligible in disordered systems , which leads to the equality which we observe numerically .",
    "with this paper we have begun our study of transport properties for quantum multi - baker maps .",
    "our central motivation for this study is , of course , to use a simple , classically chaotic system with transport and entropy production and to explore the differences between the classical system , and its quantum counterpart .",
    "the multi - baker map provides a convenient model for this study .    in order to set the stage for further work",
    ", we considered here the extreme quantum limit of the qmb where each unit cell contains just two quantum states , in either the position or momentum representation .",
    "further work will now be devoted to the properties of the qmb for smaller values of @xmath2 , including a study of the semi - classical regime where the planck constant is very small , and the transition to the classical limit .    in order to explore a variety of versions of the qmb , we used the fact that the weyl quantization procedure for maps on torus allows some freedom in the choice of phases for the quantum states",
    ". this freedom can be thought of as a freedom in the location of the quantum states in the position and momentum representations , or as the effects of bohm - aharonov current loops on the wave functions in each unit cell . for large @xmath2 and for the uniform qmb ,",
    "we have been able to proceed with analytical calculations for the quasi - energies , and for the quantum states for different boundary conditions .",
    "these calculations showed ballistic transport of probability amplitudes within the chain , due to the bloch wave structure of the eigenstates , as well as a slow decay of probability from an open , finite chain , due to the difficulty that long wavelength modes have in escaping through the exit channels .",
    "the random phase case exhibits localization of wave functions and the appropriate equations were shown to be close to the basic equations of the anderson model of localization .",
    "all of these results show that the behavior of the qmb for @xmath107 is quite different from that of the classical multi - baker map , which exhibits normal , diffusive transport . for larger @xmath80 , smaller @xmath2",
    ", we should see behavior that more closely approximates the classical behavior , at least on the logarithmic time scale .",
    "there are quite a large number of directions for future studies of the qmb . for the case of",
    "@xmath5 we have studied only the uniform and random phase cases .",
    "one can also consider models with periodic distribution of phases over several cells , models in which there is a well defined , systematic progression of phases from one cell to the next , or where the phases in the cells are incommensurate ( oscillating with irrational periods ) .",
    "the situation for larger @xmath80 is such that there are @xmath80 quantum states in each cell , so that there will then be several transport channels in the qmb .",
    "it remains to be seen what the properties of these systems will be , both as functions of @xmath80 as well as functions of the phases of the wave functions in the cells . as @xmath2 approaches zero , one can study the semi - classical limit and the approach to classical , chaotic behavior of the qmb .",
    "clearly , we should obtain the diffusive behavior independently of the distribution of phases , that is both for the uniform ( ballistic ) case , as well as for the random ( localized ) case .",
    "such a study should reveal for this simple system whether the diffusive behavior arises directly through the semi - classical limit , or whether one needs to assume additional mechanism  such as interaction with environment , or decoherence  to regain classical properties .",
    "the qmb is simple enough to consider the clasical limit for uniform phase , random phase , and incommensurate phase model , among others .",
    "the investigation of these questions will be the subject of further papers in this series .",

    "we thank the organizers of the 38th winter school of theoretical physics `` dynamical semigroups : dissipation , chaos , quanta '' in ladek zdrj , poland , for providing us with an opportunity to present and discuss these results .",
    "due to the escape of probability density , the eigenvalues that determine the time dependence of the probability density in each cell move to the interior of the unit circle .",
    "a simple proof of this fact can be given as follows .",
    "let @xmath286 be a normalized eigenstate of the open quantum multibaker .",
    "since the multibaker dynamics requires that @xmath287 for @xmath66 , it follows that @xmath288 the probability of the system being in cell @xmath99 is given by @xmath289 . in the boundary cells we have @xmath290{rcl }",
