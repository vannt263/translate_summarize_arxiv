    "many textbooks on quantum field theory start with scalar fields and discuss , after preparing the arena with non - interacting free fields , the quartic self - coupling as the simplest conceivable interaction . at this stage renormalization or , on the lattice",
    ", the continuum limit has to be discussed in a non - trivial way .",
    "a mild generalization leads to @xmath0 real scalar fields self - coupled by a unique quartic o(@xmath4 invariant term .",
    "as is well known the kinetic term dictates the field dimension and implies a mass dimension @xmath5 for the coupling constant .",
    "thus the self - coupled scalar theory is renormalizable in @xmath6 in fact , @xmath7 is the standard model in the limit where all fields except the higgs are stripped away .",
    "the perturbative renormalization group @xmath8-function is positive for small coupling and the models are hence perturbatively trivial .",
    "simulations with simple lattice discretizations suggest that this features is also true nonperturbatively .",
    "an analogous fermionic model can be written in terms of @xmath0 ` real ' majorana fermions .",
    "now , because there is only one derivative in the fermionic kinetic term , a quartic coupling has dimension @xmath9 . the renormalizable theory in @xmath10",
    "has in fact again a unique o(@xmath4 invariant interaction .",
    "it has been proposed and considered in the limit of @xmath11 a long time ago @xcite and is now known as the gross - neveu ( gn ) model . for the sign of the quartic interaction that has been discussed to be the physically meaningful one in @xcite",
    "the gn model is even asymptotically free .",
    "this feature that is shared by qcd was one of the main reasons for gross and neveu to study the model as an analog toy - model .",
    "the analogy goes even further as there also is a chiral symmetry in the gn model .",
    "although it is only discrete , this symmetry involves the two - dimensional analog of @xmath12 and is only present for massless fermions , which are thus distinguished by an enhanced symmetry .",
    "gross and neveu have shown that the chiral symmetry breaks spontaneously ( at infinite @xmath4 and that mass generation and ` dimensional transmutation ' take place .",
    "this beautiful parameter - free theory is then an analog of qcd in the chiral limit .",
    "there have been some early efforts @xcite to study this model beyond perturbation theory by monte carlo simulation .",
    "attempts employing today s standard techniques used for qcd @xcite were made in @xcite and @xcite . however in @xcite and @xcite we have proposed techniques to simulate the fermionic grassmann integral in a more direct and efficient way using its loop gas representation @xcite , see also @xcite for a related effort . in this formulation , using wilson fermions , the simulations resemble those for simple spin models with efficient algorithms .",
    "no nearly singular inversions and no nonlocal effective bosonic actions occur . while in more than two dimensions a sign problem still prevents the application of this technique @xcite it is well suited for the gn model as we demonstrate below .    like in qcd",
    ", the important chiral symmetry is violated by the wilson discretization and an additive mass renormalization , i.e. a nontrivial definition of the critical point , is required . in this article",
    "we discuss , that , depending on the boundary conditions on a finite torus , an extra minus sign from the non - invariance of the majorana fermion measure has to be taken into account in symmetry relations .",
    "we consider this as ( a primitive form of ) an anomaly .",
    "one such symmetry relation allows us to define a finite volume chiral order parameter .",
    "this way of defining the chiral point in parameter space is particularly convenient in the loop gas representation , where it corresponds to a well measurable topological variable .    after a definition of the model in section  2",
    "the anomaly is discussed for the continuum theory in section  3 and connected with the fluctuating boundary conditions in section  4 . in section  5",
    "the loop gas representation and simulation on the lattice are described and numerical results are reported in section  6 .",
    "finally we end in section  7 with conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the o(@xmath0 ) invariant gn model @xcite is best written in terms of @xmath0 self - coupled majorana fermions @xmath13 with the euclidean action @xmath14 where the contracted index @xmath15 refers to the global ` flavor ' symmetry and @xmath16 is spin . for a majorana fermion @xmath17 is not independent but just an abbreviation for @xmath18 with the 2-dimensional dirac matrices @xmath19 and the charge conjugation matrix @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 in two dimensions the model is renormalizable in the strict sense , no other four - fermion interaction is compatible with the global o(@xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , the models with @xmath22 are perturbatively asymptotically free .",
    "the thirring model @xmath3 has no divergent coupling renormalization . at vanishing fermion mass @xmath23",
    ", there is in addition a discrete chiral invariance @xmath24 . \\label{chisym}\\ ] ] a standard step in treating the gn model , both in the continuum and on the lattice , is to factorize the interaction into bilinears at the expense of introducing a scalar @xmath25 . foreclosing for a moment the lattice version , where @xmath26 becomes the cell volume @xmath27",
    ", we write in the boltzmann factor at each @xmath28 @xmath29 this may be formally proven by shifting @xmath30 , but perhaps more convincingly , we state that both sides agree as polynomials in the nilpotent grassmann bilinear [ @xmath31 .    after the introduction of @xmath25 we are led to the fermionic partition function @xmath32 \\label{pf}\\ ] ] as the basic fermionic building block . in this formula @xmath33 represents only one flavor .",
    "we imagine this fermionic functional integral here formally on a finite torus of extent @xmath34 in the continuum .",
    "the two component ( ` bits ' ) object @xmath35 with @xmath36 labels four possible ( anti)periodic boundary conditions @xmath37 the pfaffian pf is the counterpart of the determinant associated with dirac fermions . note that pf is only defined for antisymmetric matrices and that the operator in ( [ pf ] ) [ absorbing @xmath38 and @xmath39 now into @xmath30 ] @xmath41 indeed has this property for all four choices of @xmath35 .",
    "one relation for pfaffians is that they square to determinants , @xmath42)^2 = { \\ensuremath{\\operatorname{det } } } [ a ( \\sigma)].\\ ] ] note that the sign of @xmath43 , which is our focus in the next section , is not determined by the determinant .",
    "by a suitable choice of dirac matrices @xmath44 can be taken to be real .",
    "hence its eigenvalues are imaginary and come in pairs @xmath45 in addition , by using @xmath12 , it is trivial to demonstrate that @xmath46 possesses precisely the _ same pairs _ of eigenvalues . by arguments analogous to those used for weyl fermions in connection with the global anomaly @xcite a functional definition of the pfaffian as a root of the determinant has to be smooth under deformations of @xmath30 .",
    "for some reference field @xmath30 where there are no vanishing eigenvalues we define the pfaffian by multiplying all positive eigenvalues @xmath47 only .",
    "this represents a certain definition of the ( irrelevant ) over - all phase . a possible simple reference field would be @xmath48 , the free massive majorana fermion .",
    "then the pfaffian for other field configurations including its sign follows from smoothness .",
    "again as in @xcite this requires us to follow the flow of individual eigenvalues as functionals of @xmath30 .",
    "as a pair of them crosses zero the associated eigenvectors allow us to follow the members of the pair separately and defines a unique continuation of the phase of the pfaffian through the crossing . from the spectral properties discussed above we conclude that @xmath49 $ ] must be either symmetric or antisymmetric in @xmath30 @xmath50 in the next paragraph",
    "we shall show that @xmath51 holds .",
    "we consider an interpolation @xmath52 , \\hspace{1em }    t \\in [ - 1 , 1]\\ ] ] and assume @xmath49 \\not= 0 $ ] as otherwise the proof is trivial .",
    "then the question of ( anti)symmetry in @xmath53 can be ` decided ' in an infinitesimal neighborhood of @xmath54 which we can control by leading order perturbation theory .    except for",
    "@xmath55 the eigenvalues at @xmath54 do not vanish but are of order @xmath56 .",
    "hence there is no zero - crossing , which proves the lower line of ( @xmath57 ) . in the totally periodic case",
    "there is a pair of @xmath28-independent zero - modes .",
    "the 2-spinors @xmath58 are chosen to diagonalize the spin matrix of the perturbation @xmath59 @xmath60 now in leading order degenerate perturbation theory we find two eigenvalues @xmath61 associated with these eigenvectors .    unless this integral vanishes we see that exactly one pair of eigenvalues crosses zero as we move @xmath62 and hence the pfaffian changes sign .",
    "the sign @xmath63 can not jump with @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if the integral above vanishes , i.e. @xmath30 has a vanishing zero - momentum component , we deform @xmath30 a little such that this is not the case anymore .",
    "now ( [ pfarity ] ) is established .",
    "we note that our general result above is consistent with the explicit evaluation in the continuum limit of the wilson - pfaffian for constant @xmath30 , see appendix a in @xcite .",
    "inspired by this calculation we give another formal proof of the above result for a continuum theory regularized by a cut - off in momentum space .",
    "we start from the identities @xmath64 and @xmath65 = { \\ensuremath{\\operatorname{det } } } \\gamma_5    { \\ensuremath{\\operatorname{pf } } } [ a ( \\sigma ) ] .\\ ] ] the det in the last line is taken in the function space over which @xmath66 is integrated ( with anticommuting expansion coefficients ) . if pf is written as a grassmann integral , then @xmath67 is the jacobian of @xmath68 .",
    "each @xmath69 block contributes a factor @xmath70 in the usual sense .",
    "we now imagine to regularize the fermion integral by a finite mode number cutoff .",
    "if we impose this cutoff in a way preserving the symmetry of rotations by @xmath63 then for each incorporated mode @xmath71 also @xmath72 has to be included .",
    "this leads to an odd total mode number only for @xmath55 because of the unpaired mode @xmath73 .",
    "thus we have @xmath74 representing a non - invariance of the integration measure in the case of fully periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it also follows from the foregoing discussion that expectation values in the gn model at odd @xmath0 with such boundary conditions are ill defined at the chiral point in any finite volume , because the normalizing partition function vanishes .",
    "this arises at least superficially in a similar fashion as with the global anomaly in @xcite .",
    "we have introduced four different boundary conditions for the fermions in the gn model .",
    "we may consider the choice among them as an additional dynamical variable and consider general superpositions with an amplitude @xmath75 @xmath76 below we shall be interested in two special choices for the amplitudes @xmath77 the first choice is distinguished by leading to a strictly positive hopping or world - line expansion for the finite volume gn model on the lattice @xcite . the anomalous symmetry ( including the sign of det@xmath12 ) found in the previous section implies the relation @xmath78 for either choice  jointly for all flavors  we find partition functions for the interacting gn model @xmath79^n \\label{zgn}\\ ] ] which coincide at the chiral point @xmath23 as one shows by transforming @xmath80 .",

    "while with exact chiral symmetry @xmath88 vanishes , with a regularization that violates chiral symmetry by effects linear in the lattice spacing @xmath94 we can only expect to find @xmath95 if @xmath96 has been imposed as a renormalization condition .",
    "we therefore tie @xmath92 to a physical length scale to obtain a scaling situation and define @xmath97 as universal quantities vanishing in the continuum limit at the chiral point . the finite size @xmath98 supplies an infrared regulator and keeps our model well - defined ( for the boundary conditions chosen ) at the chiral point in a finite volume .",
    "this is similar to the schrdinger functional of qcd @xcite , where the pcac relation replaces the discrete chiral symmetry relations invoked here .",
    "to pass to the lattice formulation we restrict @xmath99 to the sites of a toroidal square lattice with spacing @xmath94 and integer ( anti)periodicity lengths @xmath100 .",

    "the second term eliminates the doubler modes but also breaks the chiral symmetry ( [ chisym ] ) just like a mass term .",
    "the consequences of chiral symmetry however are expected to emerge in the continuum limit . to reach it",

    "in our data analysis we obtain information on autocorrelation times @xmath221 for all primary and derived observables that we study .",
    "to avoid too much data handling we stored sub - histograms from 800 successive iterations resulting in a length of @xmath222 of our time series . between these blocked measurements autocorrelation times were small but sometimes still measurable . under these conditions our error estimates are accurate at the percent level for the error of the error @xcite . to obtain more detailed dynamical information we made some shorter runs of @xmath223 blocks of only @xmath2 iterations each",
    "this has yielded @xmath224 for @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "the unit of @xmath227 is now ` steps per site and flavor ' .",
    "we see critical slowing down here , especially for the step @xmath228 .",
    "this may be related to approaching a physically ` difficult ' volume .",
    "the simulations of free fermions in @xcite have shown very little slowing down .",
    "the less favorable , but still not too bad , performance here is probably related to the flavors holding back each other . with growing coupling",
    "the different flavors get more more correlated , but they are only updated ` one at a time ' with the others frozen until @xmath147 is met .",
    "one could in principle try to influence the frequency of this by introducing a weight @xmath229 as done in @xcite for the ising model .",
    "in addition a second active flavor , needed anyway to simulate four - point functions , could be beneficial here .",
    "we have successfully incorporated the gn interaction in the loop gas representation of majorana fermions and found the algorithm of @xcite to remain rather efficient although some critical slowing down is visible .",
    "we have clarified the anomalous discrete chiral symmetry behavior in a finite volume .",
    "it can be used to define the chiral continuum limit with wilson fermions by monitoring a topological observable @xmath154 related to fluctuating boundary conditions in the finite volume loop gas .",
    "it serves a purpose similar to the pcac relation in the schrdinger functional scheme for qcd and makes the required mass fine - tuning quite manageable . to complete the definition of a finite volume scheme for the gn model we at present still lack a good definition of a running coupling in a finite volume .",
    "the quantity proposed in @xcite will presumably be a good choice but it requires the extension of the algorithm to also sample four - point functions .",
    "this seems feasible and will be required in any case to be able to probe mass ratios for which exact conjectures have been made @xcite .",
    "it also seems advisable to implement on - shell symanzik o(@xmath230 improvement as in qcd .",
    "the action has to be augmented by only one term , @xmath231 for example , but in addition the elementary fermion operator @xmath33 needs to be improved as it can mix with @xmath232 .",
    "it would presumably be a good idea , interesting in itself , to first test this at large @xmath0 on the lattice with an analytic but nonperturbative calculation . in the end",
    "it may hopefully also be possible to shed some light on the special cases @xmath233 which may be supersymmetric models in disguise @xcite .    from the algorithmic point of view",
    "we have seen here that with the sign problem absent in two dimensions ( apart from a milder form in the finite size effects ) we could simulate a physically interesting interacting fermionic theory with the all - order strong coupling / hopping reformulation as an alternative to hmc methods @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we explore in lattice perturbation theory to order @xmath206 some of the quantities that were studied numerically before . to evaluate quantities in leading order perturbation theory",
    ", it is useful to exploit the fact that the grassmann integrals for each individual flavor are linear in each @xmath234 because it multiplies the bilinear @xmath235 at @xmath28 whose square vanishes .",
    "hence one derives @xmath236 with @xmath237 and @xmath238 which is given in terms of propagators @xmath239 inverse to @xmath240 with fixed boundary conditions @xmath35 .",
    "due to translation invariance we find @xmath241 with the volume @xmath242 , and similarly @xmath243 in addition we can make use of @xmath244    there is a small subtlety here .",
    "the vanishing of the doubly periodic partition function @xmath245 trivially implies @xmath246 .",
    "a singularity in the propagator @xmath247 lifts however the zero - mode and yields an o(@xmath94 ) difference @xmath248 =    \\frac{2 c_{00}}{\\sqrt{(l_0 ^ 2 + l_1 ^ 2 ) / 2 } } .",
    "\\label{delk}\\ ] ] the constant derives from sums over momenta appropriate for the respective boundary conditions and the numerical symanzik expansion ( see appendix d of @xcite ) yields @xmath249 here and below we perform the numerical evaluations for @xmath250 .",
