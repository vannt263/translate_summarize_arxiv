    "both of these features are consistent with a mixed population of ir@xmath10 and ir@xmath8 ions introduced by doping .",
    "it should be noted that the doping dependence of the ir l@xmath21-edge absorption spectra is difficult to observe with conventional xas methods due to the effect of core - hole lifetime broadening , which is more than twice as large for ir ( 5.3 ev ) as it is for rh ( 2.1 ev)@xcite .",
    "it is only by utilizing the pfy - xas technique , which suppresses such core - hole lifetime effects , that we can resolve these features in the present study .",
    "the combination of rh and ir xas results allow us to draw four main conlusions : ( 1 ) the rh dopant ions in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 adopt a 3 + rather than 4 + oxidation state .",

    "( 3 ) the electronic effect of rh - doping is to tune band - filling via hole - doping .",
    "( 4 ) the magnetic effect of rh - doping is to introduce quenched non - magnetic vacancies ( 2 per dopant ion ) .",
    "we must emphasize that while the rh@xmath7/ir@xmath8 picture will accurately describe sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 at low dopings , and within the percolation regime that our rmxs measurements will focus on ( i.e. for 0 @xmath4 x @xmath4 0.24 ) , at higher dopings this picture must be modified .",
    "the complication arises from the fact that once the concentration of rh reaches x = 0.50 there will no longer be enough potential ir@xmath8 ions available to balance the electronic charge . as a result , while the lower dopings will be dominated by rh@xmath7 ions , the higher dopings must contain some mixture of 3 + and 4 + oxidation states .",
    "this scenario appears to be consistent with the xas fit parameters provided in table i. although the position of the rh l@xmath21 edge white - line does not change between x = 0.07 and x = 0.70 , the width of the white - line peak becomes significantly broader for x = 0.42 and x = 0.70 .",

    "the correlation lengths within this phase range from 800 to 1000  . ]    to summarize , the magnetic phase diagram of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 is distinguished by three major features : ( 1 ) the disappearance of magnetic order at a critical doping of x@xmath5 @xmath6 0.17 , ( 2 ) a doping - induced change in magnetic structure between x = 0 and x = 0.07 , and ( 3 ) a thermally - driven transition between long - range ( lro ) and short - range ( sro ) magnetic order at t@xmath49 .",
    "the rmxs data also allows us to address the question of how rh - doping affects the @xmath9 = 1/2 character of sr@xmath0iro@xmath3 . in previous work",
    "@xcite , the @xmath9 = 1/2 ground state has been identified on the basis of an anomalously large l@xmath21/l@xmath0 magnetic intensity ratio , which arises due to the selection rules and transition matrix elements associated with the l@xmath0 ( 2p@xmath26 @xmath23 5d@xmath22 ) and l@xmath21 ( 2p@xmath22 @xmath23 5d@xmath22 , 5d@xmath58 ) rmxs processes . the energy dependence of the ( 0,1,21 ) magnetic bragg peak in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 is provided in fig .",

    "in fact , no magnetic bragg peaks could be detected at the l@xmath0 edge for either sample , indicating that i(l@xmath21)/i(l@xmath0 ) @xmath59 200 .",
    "a similar result has also been reported for sr@xmath0ir@xmath45mn@xmath46o@xmath3 [ ref .",
    "14 ] , suggesting that the @xmath9 = 1/2 character of sr@xmath0iro@xmath3 is very robust against doping in general .",
    "this persistence of strong @xmath9 character implies that the electronic transition at x @xmath6 0.16 is not driven by the tuning of soc effects , but rather by a combination of hole - doping and/or doping - induced structural changes @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the interpretation of the l@xmath21/l@xmath0 magnetic intensity ratio has recently been questioned by chapon and lovesey @xcite and moretti sala et al @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested that the magnetic intensity at the l@xmath0-edge may vanish if ir@xmath10 magnetic moments are aligned within the _ ab_-plane , regardless of the splitting of the t@xmath20 levels .",
    "this point is relevant to both sr@xmath0iro@xmath3 and sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 , as both systems adopt canted _",

    "however , in the case of sr@xmath0ir@xmath61mn@xmath62o@xmath3 , which displays a collinear c - axis antiferromagnetic structure @xcite , this objection does not apply .",
    "in addition , mn - doping represents an even stronger pertubation to magnetism ( @xmath9 = 1/2 @xmath23 s = 3/2 ) and soc ( 5d @xmath23 3d ) than rh - doping . although the signatures of the @xmath9 = 1/2 state in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 may still require further investigation , the analogy with sr@xmath0ir@xmath1mn@xmath16o@xmath3 suggests that , at least on a qualitative level , these conclusions will still hold true .",

    "in addition , the orientation of the ordered moments in sr@xmath0iro@xmath3 appears to be strongly coupled to the octahedral rotations , with the canted antiferromagnetic ground state displaying a spin - canting angle of @xmath6 8@xmath15 [ refs",

    "spacegroup @xcite . in the absence of correlated octahedral rotations , the superlattice peaks at ( 1,2,l)/(2,1,l )",

    "spacegroup , with a unit cell reduced by @xmath63 in the _ ab_-plane and halved along the _ c_-axis . as a result , the width of the ( 1,2,21 ) superlattice peak provides a window into the correlation lengths associated with these octahedral rotations . for dopings of x = 0 to x = 0.24 the width of the superlattice peak is essentially the same as that of the structural bragg peak , implying that the correlation lengths are long - ranged and the octahedral rotations are well - ordered . at higher dopings ( x = 0.42 ) , the superlattice peak becomes significantly broader than the bragg peak , indicating reduced octahedral correlation lengths ( @xmath64 @xmath6 500  ) and increased rotational disorder .",
    "this suggests that while rotational disorder may play an important role in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 at higher dopings ( x @xmath17 0.42 ) , it is not a significant effect at lower dopings ( x @xmath4 0.24 ) , and is unlikely to drive the suppression of magnetic order at x@xmath5 .",
    "it is very interesting to consider the mechanism responsible for the disappearance of magnetic order at x@xmath65 @xmath6 0.17 .",
    "we have already touched upon two potential mechanisms for this transition in the preceding sections . from the lack of doping - dependence associated with the l@xmath21/l@xmath0 magnetic intensity ratio ( section iii.d )",
    ", we infer that this magnetic transition is not the result of spin - orbit tuning .",
    "similarly , although it is possible for magnetic order to be disrupted by the disorder of iro@xmath13/rho@xmath13 octahedral rotations @xcite , our measurements of the superlattice bragg peaks associated with these rotations ( section iii.e ) reveal no significant change in correlation lengths at x@xmath5 .",
    "other doping - induced structural changes , such as a sudden jump in ir - o - ir bond angle , have previously been reported in the vicinity of x@xmath5 [ ref .",
    "9 ] . however , these structural changes appear to be discontinuous , while the observed decrease in t@xmath47 and t@xmath49 is clearly continuous .    an alternative explanation is provided by percolation theory ( figs .",
    "4(b , c ) ) , which has proven extremely successful at describing magnetism in doped cuprates such as la@xmath0cu@xmath1(zn , mg)@xmath2o@xmath3 [ ref .",
    "this argument assumes that sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 can be adequately described by a local moment picture for x @xmath4 0.24 , a claim which appears reasonably well - justified based on previous resistivity data @xcite .",
    "as sr@xmath0iro@xmath3 is effectively a two - dimensional s = 1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet , we expect the conventional ( i.e. spin - only ) percolation threshold for this system to be x@xmath50 = 0.407 [ ref .",
    "since each rh@xmath7 dopant ion introduces two non - magnetic vacancies , the effective site dilution , x@xmath66 , will be equal to twice the nominal rh concentration .",
    "we suggest that the apparent discrepancy between x@xmath67 = 2x@xmath5 = 0.34 and x@xmath50 = 0.407 may reflect novel percolation behavior arising from strong soc effects .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite has shown that quantum orbital systems are much more sensitive to site dilution than pure spin systems , and can display considerably lower percolation thresholds . in a system where the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are strongly entangled , as in sr@xmath0iro@xmath3 , it is therefore unsurprising that a spin - only percolation calculation overestimates the value of x@xmath50 .",
    "this result suggests a full theoretical description of dilute magnetism in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 must account for both spin and orbital percolation effects , raising the possibility of exciting new percolation physics in the strong soc regime .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have used a combination of resonant x - ray techniques to investigate the chemical , electronic , and magnetic properties of the doped spin - orbital mott insulator sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "xas measurements clearly demonstrate that rh - doping introduces rh@xmath7 and ir@xmath8 ions into this material , leading to ( 1 ) hole - doping and ( 2 ) magnetic dilution of the system .",
    "rmxs measurements reveal a doping - induced change in magnetic structure at x @xmath4 0.07 , which leads to the development of a canted _ ab_-plane antiferromagnetic state ( af - ii ) for x = 0.07 , 0.11 , and 0.15 .",
    "magnetic order is fully suppressed above x@xmath5 @xmath6 0.17 ( or x@xmath67 @xmath6 0.34 ) , a result which suggests novel percolation effects and intriguing differences from diluted cuprates .",
    "we hope these results will help to motivate further theoretical and experimental work on sr@xmath0ir@xmath1rh@xmath2o@xmath3 and other doped 5d systems in the future .",
