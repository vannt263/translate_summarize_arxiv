    "in @xmath0 collisions at hera , the incoming electron or positron radiates a virtual vector boson which then interacts with the proton . in the hardest high - energy collisions ,",
    "this boson may be a @xmath1 or @xmath2 , but the vast majority of collisions are mediated by a virtual photon .",
    "its virtuality  varies from a lower limit of @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , given by the mass squared of the electron , to an upper limit of @xmath5 gev@xmath4 given by the energy of the collider .",
    "the large majority of collisions are at very low  values , where the photon is quasi - real , and are referred to as photoproduction reactions .",
    "the highest-  range is that of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . at intermediate  values of the order of 1 gev@xmath6",
    ", there is a transition region .",
    "while all interactions of the photon at hera are assumed to be governed by qcd , the photoproduction and dis regions exhibit different features .",
    "the quasi - real photon may interact in two basic ways : it may couple immediately to a hard quark - antiquark pair , or it may interact by means of an intermediate partonic structure .",
    "the latter process , for quasi - real photons , is often modelled by means of the vector meson dominance hypothesis , in which the photon fluctuates into a mesonic state which then interacts with the proton .",
    "hard scatters may then occur in which a parton originating from this state scatters off a parton from the proton .",
    "this scatter may be calculated in perturbative qcd , but the original fluctuation of the photon into a partonic state is not necessarily calculable in this way . hence the probability @xmath7 that a parton @xmath8 is found with a fraction @xmath9 of the photon energy must often be obtained phenomenologically .",
    "models based on a hadronic structure have been used , and also models based on fits to experimental data from photon - photon scattering .    in dis , the partonic structure of the interacting photon is often taken to be entirely calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "the non - perturbative component to the photon structure will then die away with  through the transition region mentioned above .",
    "this region corresponds to the mass range of the vector mesons and the range below which perturbative methods in qcd may be expected to fail .    in this report",
    ", recent preliminary measurements by zeus of the resolved structure of the virtual photon are discussed .",
    "they are made over a wide  range in an attempt to understand better the partonic behaviour of the photon .",
    "+   +   +    the basic types of hard photon process are illustrated in fig .  1 . in direct processes ( a )",
    "the entire photon takes part in the hard interaction and there is no remnant in the photon direction . in resolved processes such as ( b ) , the photon fluctuates into a state out of which a parton emerges to scatter off a parton from the proton .",
    "there is a photon remnant which takes the fraction of the photon energy which is not given to the hard scatter .",
    "this diagram indicates processes in which the partonic state is non - perturbative in nature , and sometimes though controversially termed ` hadronic ' .",
    "the hard scatter itself , which produces the final - state jets , is of course calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "as depicted , ( a ) and ( b ) are lowest - order qcd diagrams with regard to the hard scatter , and the direct and resolved classes are separate",
    ". corresponding diagrams at higher order can be drawn .",
    "while it is still often possible , for calculational purposes , to divide these into ` direct ' and ` resolved ' classes , more care is needed and the division between the two classes can become somewhat arbitrary .    diagram ( c ) indicates a process in which the photon splits into a @xmath10 pair , and which is nlo compared to ( a ) .",
    "when this vertex involves a sufficiently high momentum transfer it is perturbatively calculable , as is the case if the @xmath10 pair have a high @xmath11 or if the incoming photon is highly virtual . a photon remnant is present , though not necessarily at low @xmath11 , and only part of the photon energy is given to the final - state jets .",
    "this type of process may therefore be classed as resolved . in deciding whether to call the remaining photon system a remnant or a third jet ,",
    "however , an arbitrary decision must be taken as to the @xmath11 value that will constitute the boundary between the two cases .",
    "the basic formula for calculating dijet cross sections in @xmath0 collisions can be written as @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes the probability for the incoming @xmath14 to radiate a given virtual photon , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the photon and proton .",
    "the hypothesis of factorisation asserts that these are process - independent . for direct processes , @xmath17 .",
    "in general there are two contributions to the resolved @xmath18 pdfs : @xmath19 the boundary between the non - perturbative and perturbative regions corresponds to the so - called ` factorisation scale ' @xmath20 .",
    "the renormalisation scale @xmath21 refers to the momentum transfer squared of the hard qcd scatter . in dis",
    ", @xmath22 is often assumed to be zero .",
    "in their recent analysis , zeus identify dijet events in the rear ( @xmath23 ) hemisphere of the @xmath24 centre - of - mass frame with @xmath25 gev .",
    "a measure of @xmath9 is @xmath26 where the jets are labelled 1 , 2 and @xmath27 is pseudorapidity .",
    "figure 2 shows a typical @xmath28 distribution in photoproduction .",
    "the prominent peak is due largely to direct processes , while the tail is due largely to resolved processes ; its precise shape depends on the cuts applied to the observed jets .",
    "the incoming virtual photon energy @xmath29 is measured by tagging the scattered electron / positron in the zeus calorimeter system .",
    "a specially built calorimeter was inserted close to the beam line in order to enable  values through the transition region to be studied .     +    a pure lo direct process has @xmath9 = 1 , but the effects of initial and final state radiation and hadronisation reduce the value of the observed quantity .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to regard the regions @xmath30 and @xmath31 as resolved - dominated and direct - dominated respectively .",
    "provided the proton pdfs are known , the direct processes are reliably calculable in perturbative qcd , both in photoproduction and dis .",
    "the present investigation is concerned primarily with the size of the resolved - dominated contribution as a function of .",
    "this can be studied by means of the ratio @xmath32 a number of experimental and theoretical uncertainties tend to cancel in evaluating @xmath33 , whose variation with the kinematics of the process may be used to study the behaviour of the effective partonic structure of the virtual photon .",
    "the disaster++ monte carlo ( d. graudenz ) was used to calculate parton cross sections at nlo .",
    "these were corrected to hadron level using the well - tried ariadne program .",
    "the data were corrected to hadron level using pythia .",
    "the measured cross section for the production of dijets , within the given kinematic acceptance , as a function of , is shown in fig .",
    "the data are compared to disaster calculations using a renormalisation scale @xmath34 , with @xmath35 also set to this value .",
    "the dominant theoretical uncertainty was estimated by halving and doubling this value .",
    "disaster can not be reliably used below a  value of approximately 2 gev@xmath6 .",
    "it is of interest to see that disaster predicts the direct - dominated cross sections excellently , but underestimates the total cross section through a serious underprediction of the resolved - dominated component .",
    "a standard pdf is used for the proton , the results being insensitive to this choice .",
    "disaster evaluates only point - like photon processes , namely the direct and the perturbative resolved components .",
    "no non - perturbative photon pdf or photon factorisation scale therefore applies in this calculation .",
    "a similar situation is observed when the cross sections are plotted as a function of the transverse jet energy .",
    "the underestimation of the cross sections is substantial and shows no strong -dependence . as a further study , cross sections have been plotted as a function of the pseudorapidity of the more forward jet in the proton direction .",
    "disaster was also evaluated using @xmath36 , although this is not a plausible choice for the present  values unless @xmath37 .",
    "it does , however , illustrate the sensitivity of the calculations to this scale .",
    "+   +    figure 4 shows the ratio @xmath33 , plotted as a function of  in three different ( ) @xmath6 ranges ( a - c ) .",
    "the value of @xmath33 in photoproduction events ( @xmath38 , not plotted , is estimated to be similar , within errors , to the value for the lowest  points shown .",
    "@xmath33 is seen to fall sharply over the transition region for the lowest  range , and more gently for the higher ranges . in ( d ) , @xmath33 is plotted in a different analysis in which dijet events containing a @xmath39 meson were selected , and no fall in @xmath33 is evident .",
    "the presence of either high  or a heavy quark forces a high momentum scale on the qcd process . in such situations ,",
    "the process is expected to be perturbatively calculable , with no prima facie reason for a strong  dependence .",
    "the stronger fall - off at low  values is consistent with the presence of strong non - perturbative photon structure effects in processes involving light quarks .    nevertheless , even at high",
    ", @xmath33 does not fall to zero but seems to level off at a constant value that is not strongly dependent on .",
    "this may be interpreted in terms of an effective partonic structure to the photon , even at high virtualities .",
    "the disaster calculation , evaluated using @xmath34 , is unable to account for the data , and the discrepancy of the order of 50% does not vary strongly with the event kinematics .",
    "it is evident that the full cross section is not being correctly simulated by the perturbative model used .",
    "however the jetvip model , although including a non - perturbative photon pdf , fares worse and can not be considered competitive at present .    in an earlier study , h1 measured dijet events over a range of moderate  values and interpreted the resolved cross sections in terms of an effective photon parton density ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "this at first falls sharply from its value at @xmath40 , but afterwards remains constant within statistics .",
    "however , it was not possible to demonstrate a significant deviation from the falling nlo qcd calculation .",
    "the present zeus results appear to lend weight to the view that the effective parton structure of the photon remains approximately constant over this  range .",
    "zeus has presented preliminary measurements of dijet cross sections over a range of  values crossing the transition between photoproduction and dis . a ratio of the resolved - dominated to direct - dominated cross sections is defined .",
    "it falls across this region , as the likely vector - meson dominated region of photon structure is left behind , but appears to attain a stable non - zero value . a component to the cross sections",
    "is indicated which is not modelled in the nlo qcd calculation disaster++ .",
    "the shortfall is associated with resolved processes .",
    "possible explanations might be a non - perturbative partonic structure in the photon even at high , or a surprisingly strong higher order perturbative contribution .",
    "the results are consistent with earlier h1 data . in events containing a charmed meson ,",
    "the ratio does not fall with , but remains approximately flat over the entire range , at a similar value to the overall dijet sample at high ."
