    "non - gaussian diffusion and dynamical heterogeneities have been shown to slow down or completely arrest the structural relaxation of systems , such as supercooled liquids @xcite and gels @xcite .",
    "the heterogeneous dynamics of these systems , in which individual particles are trapped in transient cages by neighboring particles , explains the non - exponential relaxation and non - gaussian diffusive behavior .",
    "two scenarios are usually proposed to explain the non - exponential relaxation behavior : a _ heterogeneous scenario _ in which the particles relax exponentially at different relaxation rates , and a _ homogeneous scenario _ where the particles relax non - exponentially at nearly identical rates @xcite .",
    "recently , the analysis of dynamical heterogeneities has been extended to other complex systems , such as granular media @xcite and liquid crystals ( lcs ) in confined nanopores @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the dynamics of lcs has been shown to share many features with supercooled liquids , especially in the so - called lc isotropic phase @xcite and in the smectic lc phase @xcite .",
    "the lc isotropic phase is a macroscopically homogeneous liquid phase , which exhibits nematic ordered domains near the isotropic - nematic ( in ) transition .",
    "the size of these nematic domains , which are driven by a precursor of the nematic phase , increases upon approaching the in - transition @xcite . the caging behavior , i.e. , the temporary localization of individual particles , as observed in supercooled liquids , is caused by the transient structural inhomogeneities of the nematic domains in the isotropic lc phase .",
    "hence , the heterogeneous dynamics of such an isotropic phase with pre - nematic - order resembles that of supercooled liquids @xcite . the non - gaussian behavior becomes even stronger by confining the lc in a nanoporous material @xcite",
    "the reason is that confinement modifies the dynamics of the lc particles , which yields a non - uniform relaxation depending on e.g. , the distance to the pore surface and the pore size , which is indeed observed experimentally by dielectric spectroscopy @xcite and quasi - elastic neutron scattering @xcite .    for the bulk smectic lcs , recent developments of experimental techniques (",
    "e.g. nmr coupled to strong magnetic field gradients @xcite , or fluorescent labeling of rods @xcite ) , allowed for direct observations of non - gaussian quasi - quantized layer - to - layer diffusion . in the light of these advances ,",
    "bier _ et al . _",
    "proposed a dynamic density functional approach to study the self - diffusion in colloidal dispersions of infinitely elongated particles @xcite . in particular , they investigated the effect of the local fluid structure , which temporarily cages individual particles and competes with the one - dimensional `` permanent '' barriers due to the smectic layered structure .",
    "this theoretical work shows qualitative agreement with recent experiments on the self - diffusion of filamentous bacteriophage _ fd _ viruses through smectic layers @xcite . in both studies ,",
    "the self - part of the van hove correlation function showed clear evidence of an inter - layer diffusion ( or _ permeation _ ) occurring by discontinuous jumps of nearly one rod length .",
    "simulations on freely rotating hard rods confirmed the important role of temporary cages and permanent barriers on the non - gaussian permeation through smectic layers , and revealed new insights on the relaxation behavior and cooperative motion of stringlike clusters @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the diffusion in bulk smectic liquid crystals of perfectly aligned hard spherocylinders .",
    "the phase diagram of parallel hard spherocylinders exhibit nematic - to - smectic ( n - sm ) and smectic - to - crystal ( sm - k ) phase transitions in a broad range of length - to - diameter ratios of the rods @xcite . using computer simulations , we are able to study the long - time relaxation decay which approximately spans up to four time decades in the whole density range from the n - sm to the sm - k transition . we investigate the substantial differences between the fluid - like in - layer and the hopping - type inter - layer dynamics , which are caused by the temporary cages and permanent barriers .",
    "in addition , we study the heterogeneous character of the layer - to - layer dynamics , which is not exclusively a feature of confined lcs , and we determine the crossover between the cage regime , with the particles rattling around their center of mass , and the long - time diffusive regime as a function of density .",
    "our system is composed of @xmath0 parallel hard spherocylinders with aspect ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the diameter of the hemispherical caps joined together by a cylindrical part of length @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the overall length of the rods is @xmath4 .",
    "the phase diagram of this system displays stable nematic , smectic , and crystal phases @xcite . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the smectic phase melts into a nematic phase for @xmath6 , and crystallizes for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the reduced pressure with @xmath9 boltzmann s constant and @xmath10 the molecular volume .",
    "we studied the dynamics of this system at pressures @xmath11 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 4.0 , and 5.0 corresponding to packing fractions @xmath12 , 0.441 , 0.475 , 0.525 , and 0.563 , respectively .",
    "we performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation in a rectangular box of volume @xmath13 with 7 smectic layers of aligned rods and we employ periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we first performed equilibration runs using mc simulations in the isobaric - isothermal ( npt ) ensemble .",
    "the initial configurations for the smectic phase were obtained by expanding a solid phase at pressures @xmath11 , 2.5 , 3.0 , and 4.0 .",
    "the smectic phase at @xmath14 was obtained by a compression run from @xmath15 .",
    "we only performed translational moves , which were accepted if no overlap was detected , whereas rotational moves were not allowed .",
    "volume changes have been attempted every _",
    "mc cycles by randomly changing the three box lengths independently .",
    "the systems were considered to be equilibrated when the packing fraction had reached a constant value . in the production runs , we carried out mc simulations in the canonical ( nvt ) ensemble , i.e. , we kept the volume constant , as the collective moves associated with the volume changes would not correspond with brownian dynamics .",
    "the maximum displacement of the mc moves was chosen in such a way that we achieve ( _ i _ ) a reasonable time of simulation , ( _ ii _ ) a satisfactory acceptance rate , and ( _ iii _ ) a suitable description of the brownian motion of the particles in a colloidal suspension . to this end , we monitored the mean square displacement in the _",
    "z_- and _ xy_-directions for several values of the maximum step size @xmath16 , with @xmath17 due to the anisotropy of the short - time self - diffusion coefficient of the rods @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 were found to be the optimal values satisfying the above requirements .",
    "we have neglected the hydrodynamic effects , as it was shown recently by computer simulations of highly concentrated rod suspensions , that the dynamics is dominated primarily by the excluded volume and steric effects @xcite .",
    "as unit of time , we have chosen @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the translational short - time diffusion coefficient , which is the isotropic average of the diffusion coefficients in the three space dimensions : @xmath22 .",
    "the intrinsic nature of the smectic phases can be appreciated by computing the in - layer @xmath23 , and inter - layer @xmath24 pair correlation functions as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in fig . 1 , we display @xmath23 and @xmath24 for varying pressures .",
    "we find features of fluid - like behavior for @xmath23 : the first peak is located at a distance approximately equal to one diameter length , and an exponential decay of the oscillations to one at long distances . by contrast , @xmath24 shows pronounced periodic correlations which reveal the layered structure along the nematic director _ n_.",
    "the location of the peaks corresponds to the center of the smectic layers , where the particle density is maximal . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the top and side view of two typical configurations of the smectic lc phase at @xmath27 and 5.0 , where one can clearly see the periodic structure of the smectic layers and the two - dimensional fluid - like structure within each layer .    , and ( b ) in - layer @xmath23 pair correlation functions as a function of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , respectively , for varying pressures as labeled.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    upon increasing the pressure , the peaks become more pronounced indicating that the smectic layers are more defined and the layer spacing reduces significantly from @xmath28 at @xmath11 to @xmath29 at @xmath14 . at @xmath11 , very close to the n - sm transition , it is difficult to distinguish the individual layers as the amplitude of the periodic structure reduces continuously , and @xmath24 approaches a nearly flat profile in the proximity of the continuous n - sm transition . at pressures @xmath30 ,",
    "the peaks become more pronounced , while the minima , corresponding to the interlayer spacings tends to zero .",
    "hence , it becomes more difficult for the particles to diffuse from layer to layer at these high pressures .     and",

    "we estimated the potential energy barrier from the boltzmann factor @xmath33 ) as in ref .",
    "@xmath34 denotes the effective potential and quantifies the potential energy barrier for the layer - to - layer diffusion . in fig .",
    "3 , we give @xmath34 at different pressures with the fitting function @xmath35^{2i}$ ] , where @xmath36 is the potential barrier height and @xmath37 the inter - layer spacing .",
    "we find @xmath38 at @xmath11 and @xmath39 at @xmath14 .",
    "the potential barrier for a rod to diffuse from layer to layer increases with increasing packing fraction , and becomes less steep when the n - sm phase transition is approached at lower densities .     in the bulk smectic phase at @xmath11 ( @xmath40 ) , 2.5 ( @xmath41 ) , 3.0 ( @xmath42 ) , 4.0 ( @xmath43 ) , and 5.0 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the solid lines are fits.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    these results should be compared with those of ref . @xcite and the barrier heights estimated recently for smectic phases of freely - rotating hard rods with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that the barrier height in smectic lc phases is higher for aligned hard rods than for freely rotating rods at the same packing fraction , i.e. , we find @xmath45 at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) for aligned rods , which should be compared with @xmath48 for freely rotating rods , and @xmath49 at @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) for parallel rods to be compared with @xmath52 .",
    "the difference in barrier height decreases with increasing pressure , and we expect that it tends to zero upon approaching the sm - k transition , where the freely rotating rods become more and more aligned . as the potential barriers are significantly lower for freely rotating rods at low packing fractions , we conclude that rotational degrees of freedom facilitate significantly the layer - to - layer diffusion .",
    "barrier - free diffusion pathways can be observed even at high densities as a result of screw dislocations .",
    "such structural defects create helical connections between neighboring smectic layers where the rods diffuse as in the nematic phase @xcite .",
    "it is not an easy task to model screw dislocations in computer simulations , as these are not compatible with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "slip boundary conditions may overcome this complication @xcite .     and mean square displacement in the direction parallel to the nematic director , calculated at the pressures indicated in the top frame.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    to study the non - gaussian behavior of the layer - to - layer diffusion , we computed the following non - gaussian parameter @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the displacement of the rods in the _ z_-direction in the time interval starting at @xmath55 and ending at @xmath56 , and @xmath57 denotes an ensemble average over all particles and initial time @xmath55 . for the in - layer diffusion , a similar non - gaussian parameter , @xmath58 , can be computed . in fig .",
    "4 , we show @xmath59 at different pressures .",
    "this parameter quantifies the deviation from the gaussian behavior of the probability density function for single - particle diffusion . at short times",
    ", the particles are freely diffusing as the trapping cage formed by the surrounding neighbors , is not reached yet , and hence , @xmath60 is basically zero . at long times ,",
    "the system enters the diffusive regime and the non - gaussian parameter tends to zero . at intermediate times , the motion of each particle is hampered by its neighbors and becomes sub - diffusive . in this time interval , @xmath60 is non - vanishing , indicating the development of dynamical heterogeneities . additionally , we find that the peak height of @xmath61 at @xmath62 increases and moves to larger values of @xmath62 upon increasing the packing fraction , as the time for the particles to escape out of their cage increases .",
    "we also plot the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath63 in fig . 4 for the same state points .",
    "the msd show a clear cage - trapping plateau , which becomes more pronounced upon increasing pressure .",
    "the time @xmath62 at which @xmath60 displays a maximum corresponds to the end of the plateau observed in the msd as can be observed clearly in fig .",
    "4 .    interestingly , non - gaussian dynamics due to cage - escape processes have also been observed in single - particle diffusion in periodic external potentials @xcite , 2d liquids @xcite , cluster crystals @xcite , but also in glasses @xcite",
    ". in particular , it was shown that the time to escape out of a cage increases because cage rearrangement ( or recaging ) involves a larger number of particles @xcite upon approaching the glass transition .",
    "@xmath64 ( not shown here ) does not deviate significantly from zero . at the highest pressure studied , the peak is lower than 0.2 , confirming that the in - layer relaxation dynamics is ( nearly ) diffusive .",
    "the behavior of the non - gaussian parameter @xmath60 is consistent with the theoretical predictions in systems of infinitely long parallel hard rods @xcite , and with the simulation results of freely rotating hard rods @xcite , although the latter exhibit higher peaks especially close to the smectic - to - crystal transition .",
    "stronger deviations have been observed in colloidal systems with short - range attractions when approaching the gel transition @xcite , or in permanent gels where _ static _ heterogeneities give rise to a plateau at long times ( i.e. , the non - gaussian parameter does not vanish ) @xcite .",
    "glass transitions , by contrast , are usually characterized by weaker deviations @xcite .",
    "the periodic shape of the effective potential implies a _ hopping - type _ diffusion in the direction of @xmath32 , with the rods rattling around in a given layer until they overcome the free - energy barrier shown in fig . 3 and jump to a neighboring layer .",
    "we quantify this layer - to - layer diffusion by calculating the self part of the van hove correlation function ( vhf ) @xcite , defined as : @xmath65\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the dirac delta function .",
    "@xmath67 measures the probability distribution for the @xmath26-displacements of the rods at time @xmath56 , given their @xmath26-positions at @xmath55 . in fig . 5 ,",
    "the self vhf is presented as a function of @xmath26 at @xmath11 to 5.0 . at @xmath68 to 5.0 , we observe the appearance of peaks at distances that correspond to the center of the smectic layers in the _ z _ direction .",
    "no peaks are observed at @xmath11 , where the barrier height ( @xmath69 ) of the effective potential for the layer - to - layer diffusion is sufficiently small , that there is no hopping - type diffusion between neighboring layers . as a result ,",
    "the discontinuous diffusion observed in strong smectic phases , with the particles occupying quasi - discretized positions , is substituted by a quasi - continuous gaussian diffusion for weak smectic phases . at long times , less and less particles are still at their original positions , and consequently , the profiles of the vhf become almost constant in a nematic phase or periodically peaked in a smectic phase .",
    "the presence of peaks at distances of neighboring layers for small to intermediate pressures show that a significant number of particles have displaced a long distance even at short times .",
    "fast_-moving particles contribute to the heterogeneous dynamics of the system and affect its structural relaxation . in recent simulations of smectic phases of freely rotating hard rods , it was shown that the fast - moving particles form stringlike clusters which exhibit cooperative motion @xcite .",
    "we believe that this result is still valid if the orientational degrees of freedom are frozen out , but further investigation is needed to address this point in more detail .     at @xmath70 ( dotted lines ) , @xmath71 ( dashed lines ) , and @xmath72 ( solid lines ) for pressure @xmath73 ( a ) , 3.0 ( b ) , 4.0 ( c ) , and 5.0 ( d).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    finally , we also study the structural relaxation by calculating the self - part of the intermediate scattering function : @xmath74>\\ ] ] at wave vectors @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which correspond to the main peaks of the static structure factor .",
    "@xmath79 is the displacement of a particle in the time interval @xmath80 .",
    "results at pressures @xmath81 2.0 , 3.0 , and 4.0 are shown in fig .",
    "6 . for the pressure range @xmath82",
    ", the inter - layer dynamics shows a significantly slow relaxation which is characterized by a two - step decay . in the first step , which is relatively fast , each rod rattles around its original position without feeling the presence of the surrounding neighbors .",
    "we detect an exponential decay of @xmath83 towards a plateau whose height and time extension increase with pressure , as also observed for colloidal glasses @xcite .",
    "the plateau establishes the beginning of the cage regime , where the particles start to interact with their nearest neighbors which form a temporary cage for the particle .",
    "the following step takes place at much longer times ( note the logarithmic scale of fig .",
    "6 ) and marks the escape from the cage regime .",
    "the second decay of @xmath84 is well fitted by a stretched exponential function of the form @xmath85 $ ] , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the time at which the intermediate scattering function decays to @xmath88 .",
    "the stretched exponential form of the relaxation decay at long times confirms the heterogeneous nature of the inter layer dynamics . in fig .",
    "7 , the relaxation time is given as a function of the packing fraction and fitted with a power law covering 4 time decades in a density interval spanning from the n - sm to the sm - k transition . at @xmath11 , we still observe an initial exponential decay at short times and a stretched exponential decay at long times , but it is very hard to detect a plateau ( if any ) due to the weak smectic character of the bulk phase and , hence , to the weak permanent background barriers ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . nevertheless , there might be a discontinuity between two separated relaxation regimes , since @xmath84 can not be fitted by a single scaling law .     for the structural relaxation in the _ z _ ( top ) and",
    "_ xy _ ( bottom ) direction at @xmath11 ( @xmath40 ) , 2.5 ( @xmath41 ) , 3.0 ( @xmath42 ) , 4.0 ( @xmath43 ) , and 5.0 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the solid lines are fits.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    by contrast , the in - layer relaxation is very fast and occurs in a single step . as can be observed in fig . 7 ,",
    "the relaxation time , which covers basically half a time decade , does not change significantly as a function of density .",
    "interestingly , the long - time decay of @xmath89 , which is exponential at short times , is also fitted by a stretched exponential function with @xmath90 at long times .",
    "this behavior is unusual for simple fluids , where a single exponential decay is observed , and can also not be associated with that of a supercooled liquid as the characteristic cage - trapping plateau is absent .",
    "however , the in - layer dynamics in smectic liquid crystals is similar to that of low - density supercooled liquids which do not display a plateau , but only a stretched exponential relaxation at long times @xcite .     as a function of packing fraction @xmath91 .",
    "the solid and empty circles refer to the inter - layer and in - layer relaxation , respectively .",
    "the solid lines are power - law fits.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , we have studied using computer simulations the diffusion of perfectly aligned rodlike particles in smectic liquid crystal phases , where the inter - layer dynamics exhibits a non - gaussian rattling - and - jumping - type diffusion due to the simultaneous presence of temporary cages and permanent barriers .",
    "the caging due to the mutual trapping of neighboring particles , slows down the diffusion , and the corresponding relaxation time depends strongly on the packing of the system .",
    "the presence of periodic permanent barriers with a height that increases with increasing density , are intrinsically associated to the layered structure of the smectic phase and determine the hopping - type layer - to - layer diffusion .",
    "as detected in out - of - equilibrium colloidal systems , such as supercooled liquids , we found that in a given time interval some particles displace longer distances than the average , giving rise to a remarkable heterogeneous dynamics which results in significant deviations from gaussian behavior .",
    "we quantified these heterogeneities by computing ( 1 ) the non - gaussian parameter @xmath92 , which significantly deviates from zero at high volume fractions ; ( 2 ) the self - part of the van hove functions , whose long tails give clear evidence of the presence of _ fast _ particles even at short times ; ( 3 ) the mean square displacement , which exhibits a plateau quantifying the average life - time of the transient cages ; and ( 4 ) the self - part of the intermediate scattering function , which characterizes the relaxation decay of the system . in the complete range of stability of the smectic phase , we observed a very slow inter - layer structural relaxation which spans over four time decades from the n - sm to the sm - k transition .",
    "we note that caging as well as the permanent barrier both contribute to the non - gaussian dynamics @xcite .",
    "the in - layer relaxation dynamics is very fast , but does not show an exponential decay at long - times , as it would be expected for simple liquids . the observed stretched - exponential decay corresponds to that of a low - density supercooled liquid where the cage effect is not sufficiently strong to yield a cage - trapping plateau .",
    "we observed qualitative agreement with the dynamics of freely - rotating hard rods @xcite , but we do find some quantitative deviations in the non - gaussian behavior , mainly caused by the huge differences in the height of the potential energy barriers .",
    "to be specific , the height of the barrier for aligned rods tends to zero at the continuous n - sm transition , while it remains finite in the case of the first order n - sm transition of freely rotating rods , which changes the dynamics significantly .",
