    "a flat manifold is a closed riemannian manifold with zero sectional curvature . from bieberbach theorems",
    ", it is known that in each dimension there is only a finite number of such manifolds , up to affine equivalence , and the problem of classifying them is important .",
    "recently , this has been achieved up to dimension six ( cf.@xcite ) , but it is not possible to do it in general .",
    "hence some interesting families of flat manifolds have been considered , as for instance those with first betti number zero or those with holonomy group @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study another special class of flat manifolds , namely those of dimension @xmath0 with holonomy group isomorphic to @xmath3 . in dimension two",
    "the klein bottle belongs to this family and in dimension three there are three such manifolds : a classical flat manifold first considered by hantzsche and wendt @xcite ( now called _ didicosm _ , see last section ) and two non - orientable ones .",
    "though here they are considered for first time together , these manifolds have been studied partially in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , mainly in the oriented case , where we shall call them _ hantzsche - wendt manifolds _ ( hw manifolds for short ; respectively hw ( bieberbach ) groups , if we consider their fundamental groups , which are bieberbach groups ) .",
    "they have many interesting properties , for instance , there are pairs of isospectral hw manifolds non homeomorphic to each other ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , hw manifolds have the @xmath4-homology of spheres ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and hence they are geometrically formal ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "we shall call the manifolds in our family _",
    "generalized hantzsche - wendt _ manifolds ( ghw manifolds for short ; respectively ghw ( bieberbach ) groups ) .",
    "one of the main results in this article is that the integral holonomy representation of a ghw manifold is of diagonal type ( theorem [ diag ] ) .",
    "this simplifies the study of this family .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the hw manifolds are exactly those considered in @xcite .",
    "another interesting property of these manifolds , or their fundamental groups , is given by the relations between them in different dimensions .",
    "in fact we show that every ghw group has a subgroup isomorphic to a ghw group of one lower dimension ( corollary 3.4 ) .",
    "moreover , from theorem [ exist ] , any @xmath0-dimensional ghw group is a subgroup of some @xmath5-dimensional one . with these observations",
    "we define a graph , whose vertices correspond to ghw groups , connecting the family , which we draw up to dimension four in the last section .",
    "it is clear that the number of non - oriented ghw flat manifolds is much greater than the number of oriented ones ( see for instance the table in section  [ no ] ) . in the non - oriented case ,",
    "there are two types of ghw groups , depending on whether the first betti number equals one or zero .",
    "we show that the case with first betti number one ( as well as the oriented case ) has only one holonomy representation , which is completely determined .",
    "hence it makes sense to carry out the calculation of the @xmath4-homology ( see theorem  [ betti ] ) .",
    "the situation in the non - oriented case with first betti number zero is much more complicated since the holonomy representation is not unique .",
    "we find the exact number of integral representations occurring in this subclass and show that it grows linearly with the dimension .",
    "this follows as a consequence of theorem [ exist ] , which asserts that every diagonal integral representation can be realized as the integral holonomy representations of a flat manifold . in section [ examples ]",
    "we consider some examples in this subclass which are similar to the hw manifolds from @xcite . in section [ outaut ]",
    "we study some symmetries of ghw manifolds .",
    "in particular , we determine the outer automorphism groups of certain subfamily of ghw groups with non - trivial center .",
    "moreover a general upper bound of the order of the outer automorphism group of ghw groups is given .",
    "there are some problems and questions which we formulate at the end .",

    "since the @xmath54 s , for @xmath55 , are linearly independent , they can not lie all in @xmath50 simultaneously , thus there is at least one of them in @xmath56 , or equivalently , there is a @xmath57 in @xmath50 , as claimed .",
    "the last assertion in the statement follows from a similar argument .",

    "moreover @xmath281 in the case of non - oriented @xmath6 with trivial center we can write the diagonal group @xmath203 in the group @xmath271 as a sum of a holonomy group @xmath1 and a set @xmath282 . hence @xmath283 . from ( [ ast ] )",
    "we only have to prove that @xmath284 equals @xmath285 in the case of trivial center and @xmath34 in case of non - trivial center .",
    "but this is proved in @xcite .    for @xmath286",
    ", @xmath287    from above the normalizer @xmath270 of the holonomy representation is equal to @xmath288 where the permutation group acts on the first @xmath121 coordinates .",
    "let @xmath289 be a cocycle which corresponds to the group @xmath135 of section  [ no ] .",
    "then @xmath290 in fact it is enough to observe that for any non - trivial @xmath291 , @xmath292 we have @xmath293 for any generator @xmath294 and @xmath295 see @xcite .",
    "we are looking for the permutation @xmath296 such that the cocycle @xmath297 is trivial .",

    "to finish the proof we observe that @xmath309 and it is generated by the image of @xmath43 .",

    "in this section we start the discussion of relations between the generalized hantzsche - wendt manifolds of different dimensions . for manifolds with first betti number one we have relations from e.  calabi s construction ( see proposition [ chain ] and @xcite , p.125 ) .",
    "but we have also a lot of links between ghw groups of different dimensions in the case when one of them has trivial center .",
    "we must say that this subject needs further research and we want to come back to it in the future . most of the observations in this section are corollaries from previous ones , and we shall omit some proofs .      *",

    "it is possible to deduce that any ghw group in dimension @xmath0 is subgroup of a ghw group in dimension @xmath315 .",
    "moreover , we can prove that it is indeed subgroup of at least two different ghw groups in dimension @xmath315 ( we omit the proof for brevity ) . in the graph",

    "the new names are due to a proposal by john h.  conway to name the ten flat 3-manifolds according to their properties , which we adopt ( this terminology is introduced in @xcite ) .          in dimension 5",
    "there are only two hw manifolds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . with the method of theorem [ diag ] , it is not difficult to prove that they have both @xmath322 ( defined in section [ examples ] ) as a subgroup , and therefore the distance between them is just two .",
    "we also have      denote by @xmath23 the given ghw group . by lemma",
    "[ contains ] there is @xmath323 such that ( after permuting coordinates ) @xmath324 and @xmath325 , where each @xmath326 is in @xmath327 .",
