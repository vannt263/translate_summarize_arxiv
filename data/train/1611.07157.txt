    "[ fig : figure1]b with the grey curve in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]a ) .",
    "this is consistent with the general rule that the glass transition temperature increases with an increase in the heating rate .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : figure1]b ( see the black curve ) , the dsc signal obtained with the ultra - high speed heating exhibits no exothermic heat due to crystallization during the heating process , unlike the case of the slow heating in fig .",

    "this clearly shows that the ultra - high speed heating successfully avoids the occurrence of crystallization after the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition .",
    "after tpp is annealed at 216  k for 600  min , on the other hand , the glass transition signal of liquid 1 completely disappears and instead a large endothermic peak appears around 250  k ( see the blue curve in fig .",

    "this indicates that there is no liquid 1 ( or glass 1 ) left in the glacial phase .",
    "this fact can not be explained by the nano - crystal scenario , since it assumes that the glacial phase is a mixture of glass 1 and nano - crystals ( see supplementary note 1 and supplementary figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 for further evidence against the nano - crystal scenario ) .",
    "thus , we assign the glacial phase obtained by annealing to be glass 2 .    in order to clarify what is happening at the endothermic peak , we employ the following special temperature protocol ( see the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure1]b and the bottom part of panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "first we anneal a sample at 216  k for 600  min , which completely transforms liquid 1 to the glacial phase , and then quench it to @xmath12 k below @xmath2 .",
    "next we heat the system until the temperature @xmath10 indicated by the yellow point on the blue curve , keep it at @xmath10 for a period of 0.1 s , and then cool it again from @xmath10 to @xmath13 = 173 k below @xmath2 .",
    "here we use the cooling and heating rate of 10@xmath9 k s@xmath7 .",
    "the second heating from @xmath13 provides the yellow dashed dsc curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b .",
    "we can clearly see the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition signal in the yellow dashed curve . furthermore , the perfect overlap of the glass transition signal between the black curve and the yellow dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b suggests that the glacial phase ( or , glass 2 ) fully returns back to liquid 1 already much before crystal melting takes place in the heating process ( more specifically , either before reaching @xmath10 in the first heating process or during 0.1 s kept at @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , the endothermic peak around 250 k in the blue curve should not be associated with the crystals that should melt around 300 k.     ( top ) and for reverse llt as a function of the re - cooling temperature @xmath10 ( bottom ) .",

    ", width=377 ]    we can see that the crystal melting behaviour around 300  k is almost perfectly the same between the blue curve and the yellow dashed curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b ) .",
    "this result clearly indicates that the crystals are formed exclusively during annealing and they are not affected by heating and cooling below @xmath10 , suggesting that liquid 2 is prone to crystallization compared to liquid 1 .",
    "we also note that the amount of the heat of fusion in the blue curve is much smaller than that in the grey curve , which is for a fully crystallized sample .",
    "this can be explained as follows : crystallization takes place preferentially in liquid 2/glass 2 domains , which are newly formed during annealing , but its glassy nature inhibits both nucleation and growth of crystals .",

    "the endothermic peak becomes smaller and the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition signal emerges and gradually becomes larger .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2]e shows the @xmath10-dependence of the heat released during the reverse llt , which should be proportional to the amount of liquid 2 remaining after heated to @xmath10 .    on the basis of these results , we discuss the origin of the new endothermic peak emerging after annealing at 216 k ( see the blue curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : figure1]b ) .",
    "there are the following three possible origins for the endothermic peak appearing around 250 k : ( i ) the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition , ( ii ) the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition , and ( iii ) the reverse llt from liquid 2 to liquid 1 .",
    "whichever the transformed state contains liquid 1 or liquid 2 , the system is initially in a glassy state and , thus , it should exhibit a glass transition signal upon heating before finally returning to liquid 1 @xcite .",
    "there is a difference in the heat flow level between before and after the endothermic peak , indicating the difference in the heat capacity @xmath20 ( see the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b ) .",
    "this is consistent with the occurrence of glass transition .",
    "however , we show below that the glass transition can not be a primary origin of the endothermic peak .",
    "firstly we consider possibility ( i ) that the endothermic peak is due to the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition .",
    "although the position of the endothermic peak is significantly different from the glass transition peak of liquid 1 ( @xmath14 = 0 ) , it alone does not immediately mean that the system is liquid 2 and not liquid 1 .",
    "this is because ageing can generally shift the glass transition peak towards a higher temperature .",
    "thus , even if the peak is due to the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition , the peak position can depend on @xmath14 : the ageing of glass 1 should continuously shift the peak towards a higher temperature and increase the magnitude of the glass transition signal .",
    "contrary to this expectation , however , fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b tells us that an increase in @xmath14 reduces the signal of the glass - to - liquid transition and leads to the emergence of a new endothermic peak at a much higher temperature and the increase of its hight .",
    "this observation indicates that there are clearly two transitions with different origins .",
    "thus , the presence of the two distinct transitions can not be explained by scenario ( i ) based on the ageing of glass 1 . this conclusion is also supported by",
    "the fact that after the transition ( @xmath21 min ) the glass transition signal associated with liquid 1 component completely disappears .",
    "next we consider possibility ( ii ) that the endothermic peak is mainly due to the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition . the step - like change at a lower temperature",
    "is definitely associated with the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition at least for a rather short annealing time @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", the endothermic peak appearing after annealing should be associated with liquid 2 formed during annealing .",
    "we note that the temperature shift of the peak towards a high temperature with an increase in @xmath14 does not stop even after the transition is completed .",
    "however , the total heat released during the transition becomes constant after the completion of the transition ( @xmath22 min ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]d .",
    "the ageing of a glass should lead to the simultaneous increase in both the transition temperature and peak area .",
    "the lack of this feature indicates that the heat involved in the endothermic peak can not be explained by the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition alone , even taking the ageing effect into account .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b , glass 2 has already returned to liquid 1 at @xmath10 upon heating , the endothermic peak should involve the reverse llt ( see also below for the further supporting evidence ) . thus we conclude that the endothermic peak is primarily not due to the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition , although it should contribute partially .",
    "finally , we consider the remaining possibility ( iii ) that the endothermic peak should come mainly from the reverse llt from liquid 2 to liquid 1 . this scenario is strongly supported not only by the above - mentioned transformation of glass 2 to liquid 1 before reaching @xmath10 but also by the fact that the heat released by the reverse llt ( @xmath23 j / g ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]d , e ) is comparable to the heat absorbed by the forward llt ( @xmath24 25 - 27 j / g ) . here",
    "we note that the transition heat of the reverse llt does not depend on the heating rate in the range of 500 @xmath24 2000 k s@xmath7 and is almost constant within @xmath25 1 % .",
    "this reflects that the transition is between the well - defined glass 2 state , which is almost uniquely determined by the annealing temperature and the annealing time , and the liquid 1 state .",
    "the difference in the transition heat between the reverse and forward llt may come from the contribution of the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition .",
    "the onset of the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition marks the onset of the heat release ( see below on the details of the glass transition behaviour ) .",
    "we note that the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition provides the system with mobility , which is necessary for the reverse llt to proceed .    in this reverse llt scenario",
    ", we can explain the shift of the peak position towards a higher temperature with an increase in @xmath14 as a consequence of the ageing of glass 2 : glass 2 becomes more stable and its glass transition temperature becomes higher with @xmath14 , leading to the shift of the onset of the reverse llt towards a higher temperature . during annealing at @xmath15 ,",
    "a system gradually transforms from liquid 1 to the glass state of liquid 2 ( glass 2 ) with @xmath14 . reflecting this ,",
    "the total heat released during the reverse llt should increase with an increase of @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath22 min , however , it becomes constant since llt is completed , i.e. , the system almost perfectly becomes glass 2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b , d ) .",
    "this saturation indicates that the order parameter @xmath6 in glass 2 becomes almost constant for @xmath22 min .",
    "so we conclude that the transition behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b consists of the step - like glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition and the endothermic peak due to the reverse llt from liquid 2 to liquid 1 ( see below on the separation of the two transitions ) .",
    "next we consider the experimental results using the special temperature protocol ( see the bottom part of fig . [",
    "fig : figure2]a for the protocol and fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]c for the results ) . in the above",
    ", we show that liquid 2 already fully returns to liquid 1 at the yellow point marked on the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1]b . particularly , fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]c shows that the glass transition signal associated with liquid 1 gradually recovers during the endothermic process with increasing @xmath10 , clearly supporting the above - mentioned scenario that this endothermic peak is due to the reverse llt process ( liquid 2 @xmath26 liquid 1 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the reverse llt process from liquid 2 to liquid 1 should be an endothermic process since the forward llt from liquid 1 to liquid 2 during isothermal annealing is an exothermic process @xcite .",
    "we indeed confirm the amount of heat associated with the transition is about the same between the forward and reverse processes , as mentioned above .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]c that the peak position slightly shifts towards a higher temperature for higher @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that more stable parts of liquid 2 with higher @xmath6 transform to liquid 1 at higher @xmath10 .",
    "now we focus on the glass transition behaviour taking place prior to the reverse llt upon heating ( see also supplementary note 2 and supplementary figures 7 and 8) .",
    "the glass transition behaviours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]b and c suggest that , in both processes of the forward and reverse llt , the two disordered phases of liquid 1 and 2 coexist and transform reversibly with each other ( see the schematic pictures in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]a ) .",
    "this is the first unambiguous evidence not only for the reversibility and the first - order nature of llt in molecular liquids but also for the fact that the transition is between two distinct liquid states .",
    "the presence of the two glass transitions and the direct reversibility of the transition between the two liquid phases can be naturally explained by the llt scenario , but not by the nano - crystal scenario .    to be more quantitative ,",
    "we identify the onset of the glass - to - liquid transition of the glass state obtained by various annealing time @xmath14 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ( see the inset of panel e on the determination of the onset of the glass transition ) .",
    "the glass transition behaviour provides crucial information on the type of llt , i.e. , whether llt is nucleation - growth ( ng)-type or spinodal decomposition ( sd)-type @xcite .",
    "we note that ng - type llt proceeds in a metastable state while accompanying nucleation of liquid 2 droplets in liquid 1 , whereas sd - type llt proceeds in an unstable state by a continuous transformation of liquid 1 to liquid 2 .",

    "the open circles show the onset temperatures of glass transition and the widths of the half transparent belts roughly represent possible errors in their determinations .",
    "an example of the estimation of the onset temperature of a glass transition is shown in the inset of panel e. the arrows indicate the directions of the increase in @xmath14 for panels a - e and that in @xmath10 for panel f. , width=529 ]    when llt proceeds above @xmath28 k , we have two sequential glass transitions upon heating . for @xmath15=216",
    "k , for example , we identify @xmath29 k and @xmath30 k ( see fig . [",
    "fig : figure3]b ) .",
    "interestingly , the positions of the onsets of the two glass transitions do not depend upon the annealing time within errors ( @xmath31 k ) .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of ng - type of llt , reflecting that , for ng - type llt , liquid 2 with the final order parameter value is nucleated in liquid 1 with the initial order parameter value and thus the order parameter changes discontinuously from that of liquid 1 to that of liquid 2 .",
    "this coexistence of the two ` liquid ' phases during transformation can be regarded as a direct manifestation of llt and its first - order nature @xcite .",
    "here it is worth mentioning that the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition behaviour is not so clear compared to the glass 1-to - liquid 1 transition .",
    "the spinodal temperature , @xmath32 , or the stability limit of liquid 2 against liquid 1 upon heating , is estimated to be around 235 k , which is located only slightly above the onset of the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition .",
    "thus , the glass transition does not complete at this temperature within a short time .",
    "this means that the plateau of @xmath20 after the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition never appears , making it difficult to observe a typical glass transition signal . for the reverse llt to take place ,",
    "the system needs to gain mobility .",
    "once the system starts to gain mobility due to the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition , the reverse llt is immediately initiated . in other words ,",
    "the glass transition and the reverse llt almost simultaneously take place , making clear separation between the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition and the reverse llt intrinsically difficult .",
    "when llt proceeds below @xmath33 ( @xmath34 k ) , on the other hand , we can see that there is only one glass transition , whose onset temperature continuously and gradually shifts from that of glass 1 to that of glass 2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]c - e .",
    "we note that we analyse the data only after the ageing is completed ( see supplementary figure 9 and supplementary note 2 ) .",
    "this glass transition behaviour is a characteristic feature of sd - type llt , where the order parameter changes continuously with time @xcite . unlike the ng - type llt ,",
    "the reverse llt starts immediately after the first glass transition step of the glass state , whose transition temperature is located between those of glass 1 and 2 in the process of llt . here",
    "it may be worth explaining why we may conclude that there is only one glass transition : below @xmath33 ( @xmath34 k ) , the @xmath20 exhibits a minimum following the glass - transition peak , but its value is larger than the heat capacity of liquid 1 ( see the curve for @xmath35 min at @xmath15=210 k in fig .

    "[ fig : figure3]e ) .",
    "considering that liquid 2 is in a more ordered state than liquid 1 , the heat capacity of liquid 2 is expected to be smaller than that of liquid 1 .",
    "thus , the @xmath20 minimum larger than that of liquid 1 should stem from an additional contribution to @xmath20 from the reverse llt .",
    "this means that the reverse llt already starts before the completion of the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition and there is no other glass transition .",
    "we note that such behaviour is never observed for the case of ng - type llt ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]a and b ) .",
    "this simultaneous occurrence of the glass transition and the reverse llt is further supported by a clear two - step feature in the dsc curves for @xmath37 min at @xmath15=208 k in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]e .",
    "the first step is the glass - to - liquid transition and the second one is the reverse llt , unambiguously indicating that there are two distinct sequential transitions .",
    "finally , we stress that these glass transition behaviours can not be explained by the nano - crystal scenario , in which there should be only one glass transition from glass 1 to liquid 1 at @xmath4 .    , whereas for sd - type llt there is only one glass transition and its onset temperature continuously increases with @xmath14 .",

    "our dsc results clearly indicate that this is not the case and sd - type llt of the continuous nature indeed takes place below @xmath33 .",
    "thus , our finding strongly supports the physical picture of the two - order - parameter model of llt @xcite .    finally , in the reverse llt process , we can see that the onset temperature of the glass transition continuously shifts from that of liquid 2 to that of liquid 1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3]f .",

    "our study not only shows the reversibility of llt of tpp , but also its first - order nature from the coexistence of the two distinct liquid phases during llt and the transformability between them .",

    "first of all , there is no sign of the glass transition associated with liquid 1 after the formation of the glacial phase ( see fig .",
    "1b in the main text ) . in the nano - crystal scenario ,",
    "the glacial phase is considered as a mixture of glass 1 and nano - crystals .",
    "thus , the absence of the glass transition of liquid 1 means that the system is filled with nano - crystals without any amorphous parts .",
    "this is not consistent with a much smaller heat of fusion of the glacial phase than crystals ( see fig .",
    "1b in the main text ) and previous x - ray scattering experimental results @xcite .",
    "however , one may still argue that crystals are so disordered and thus the heat of fusion is much smaller than that of good crystals ( see below ) .",
    "the melting of such small unstable nano - crystals might happen at a much lower temperature than @xmath55 @xcite",
    ". then the endothermic peak might be the melting of such extremely small defective crystals . in this scenario , however , the gradual change of the glass transition temperature as a function of @xmath10 can not be explained since there should be only liquid 1 that contributes to the glass transition .",
    "furthermore , according to the x - ray scattering measurements , there is any indication of neither the formation of a new type of crystals , nor the disappearance or position change of the bragg peaks around 250 k. all these indicate that the above - mentioned scenarios based on nano - crystals can not explain our dsc results .",
    "next we show the annealing temperature @xmath49-dependence of the heating curve of tpp samples after annealed for the same fixed duration of 600 min , in supplementary figure  [ fig : tw600min ] .",
    "note that the transition is completed above @xmath49 = 216 k before 600 min , whereas it is not completed below 216 k. here we focus on the behaviours of the second transition appearing after the glass transition and the third transition around 300 k , which is the melting of crystals .",
    "we can see that the endothermic peak position of the second transition shifts towards a higher temperature with an increase in @xmath49 .",
    "the peak eventually disappears for @xmath56 k and the highest observable peak temperature is located around 270 k. on the other hand , the melting of bulk crystals always takes place around 300 k irrespective of @xmath49 .",
    "we summarize the heat associated with phase transitions ( the reverse llt , crystallization during heating , and the crystal melting ) in supplementary figure [ fig : tw600result]a and the peak temperatures of the reverse llt and the crystal melting in supplementary figure [ fig : tw600result]b .",
    "the peak temperature of the endothermic peak of the reverse llt monotonically increases with an increase in @xmath15 .",
    "below @xmath57 k , the effect may be intrinsic , but above 220 k the peak temperature shift might be due to the presence of nano - crystals embedded in glass 2 .",
    "the former is because there are few nano - crystals formed during annealing for @xmath58 k. on the other hand , the latter is because the amount of nano - crystals formed during the heating , which can be estimated by subtracting the heat released upon crystallization from the heat absorbed upon melting ( see supplementary figure 2a ) , starts to increase above 220  k with an increase in @xmath15 the increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition of liquid 2 and the reverse llt for @xmath59 k may be due to the effects of ageing , since the ageing of glass 2 proceeds more quickly at a higher @xmath15 . in relation to this origin of the temperature shift",
    ", it should be noted that according to our previous x - ray scattering studies , the number density of locally favoured structures , or the order parameter @xmath6 , does not depend on the annealing temperature @xmath15 .",
    "since the @xmath15-dependence of the endothermic position is not fully understood , however , we need further investigation to clarify its origin .",
    "if we assume that the endothermic peak is due to the nano - crystal melting , the shift of the peak position towards a higher temperature can be explained by the larger size of crystals and/or their higher perfectness for higher @xmath49 .",
    "this scenario suggests that the melting peak of nano - crystals should continuously shift towards that of bulk crystal .",
    "however , our data shows that the endothermic peak can not exist above 270 k , indicating its discontinuous jump to the melting peak of bulk crystal between @xmath60 k and 237 k ( see supplementary figure 1 ) .",
    "this discontinuity between the endothermic peak and the melting peak of bulk crystals suggests that the endothermic peak is not due to nano - crystal melting .",
    "we also note that the fact that the endothermic peak due to the reverse llt disappears above 232 k indicates that only below this temperature llt takes place .",
    "thus , the binodal temperature of llt is determined as @xmath61232 k. this value of @xmath62 is consistent with our previous estimation , @xmath63 k @xcite .",
    "if we anneal a sample above this temperature , we have only crystallization phenomena and llt can not be induced .",
    "the results shown in supplementary figure  [ fig : tw600min ] also show clearly that the onset temperature of the reverse llt increases with an increase in @xmath15 , thus suggesting the increase of @xmath16 with @xmath15 .",
    "we confirm that this is indeed the case .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : trc]a shows the @xmath10-dependence of the endothermic signal coming from the reverse llt for @xmath15=225  k. supplementary figure [ fig : trc]b plots the @xmath51-dependence of the heat released upon heating estimated from the results in supplementary figure [ fig : trc]a . from this , we can estimate the onset of the reverse llt to be located around 242  k , suggesting that @xmath64 @xmath65 242  k for glass 2 formed at @xmath15=225 k. in the main text we show that @xmath64 235  k for @xmath66 k. thus , this result clearly indicates that @xmath16 and @xmath32 increase with an increase in @xmath15 .",
    "next we show in supplementary figure  [ fig:225k ] the time dependence of the dsc heating curve for tpp samples annealed at 225 k. at this temperature , the melting peak of bulk crystals around 300 k is very large compared to those for lower @xmath15 and the amount of the crystals increases with an increase in the annealing time . on the other hand",
    ", the exothermic heat between the endothermic peak and the melting peak upon heating does not increase so much by increasing the annealing time , clearly indicating that the crystals which melt around 300 k is formed during llt and not during heating .",
    "however , it is not reasonable to assume that nano - crystals and bulk crystals are formed simultaneously in the annealing process .",
    "nano - crystals can be formed only under the situation that crystals can not grow after nucleation .",
    "extremely low mobility or internal frustration makes such a situation possible , but should make the formation of bulk crystals impossible .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is difficult to have nano - crystals and bulk crystals at the same time in an ordinary situation .",
    "finally , we evaluate the transformation heat of each process : the endothermic peak due to the reverse llt , the exothermic broad part due to crystallization , and the crystal melting peak at several annealing temperatures ( see supplementary figure  [ fig : deltae ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of the endothermic heat reflects the process of the endothermic transition .",
    "it should be noted that the melting component grows before the endothermic peak grows .",
    "this trend is evident particularly at @xmath15 below 216 k. for example , at @xmath67 k , the melting component appears around the annealing time of 30 - 60 min , whereas the endothermic peak appears around 1000 min .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the endothermic transition and crystallization are the processes of essentially different nature .",
    "this also indicates the difficulty of the nano - crystal scenario and supports the llt scenario .    in relation to the above",
    ", it should be noted that the crystal formation before the transition has been observed by neither light scattering nor x - ray scattering measurements .",
    "we show in supplementary figure  [ fig : raman ] raman scattering data at various @xmath49 s , which are taken after llt is completed .",
    "there are small peaks due to crystals in the data above @xmath49 = 225 k , whereas such peaks are absent below 223 k and the spectra are typical amorphous signals , indicating the absence of crystals .",
    "these results indicate that crystals detected by our dsc in the process of the transformation during annealing should be unusually small , i.e. , nano - crystals .      according to our optical microscopy observation @xcite ,",
    "there are two types of the dynamic processes in llt of tpp : nucleation - growth ( ng)-type and spinodal - decomposition ( sd)-type llt .",
    "this classification is based on the types of pattern evolution .",
    "we confirm the presence of these two types of llt from the glass - transition behaviour of tpp during the llt process , as discussed in the main text .",
    "we stress that the glass transition behaviour is specific to a liquid state .",
    "the existence of the two glass transition temperatures for a single - component liquid and the presence of two types ( ng - type and sd - type ) temporal changes of the glass transition temperatures strongly support that the transition is indeed llt and the endothermic peak observed on heating is the reverse llt .",
    "each feature of ng - type and sd - type llt appears in the behaviour of the glass transition temperature , @xmath2 .",
    "supplementary figure  [ fig : onsettg1-all ] is the annealing time dependence of the glass transition temperature for several annealing temperatures .",
    "we estimate @xmath2 as the onset temperature of the glass transition upon heating .",
    "the method to estimate @xmath54 is shown in the inset of the panel of @xmath27 k. the @xmath2 determined in this way is shown by an open circle on each curve .",
    "we analyse only the data after ageing of liquid 1 to see the change of the glass transition temperature due to llt alone . above 216 k",
    ", @xmath54 shows almost no change with the progress of llt , indicating that this glass transition is always that of liquid 1 .",
    "the magnitude of the glass transition step , or the amount of liquid 1 , monotonically decreases with the annealing time , reflecting the nucleation and growth of liquid 2 domains in the sample , which was observed with optical microscopy @xcite .",
    "this is the typical behaviour expected for the ng - type llt . on the other hand , @xmath54 continuously shifts towards a higher temperature with the waiting time for @xmath15 below 212 k , suggesting that the transition from liquid 1 to liquid 2 is continuous .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with sd - type llt .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the dynamical process of llt can be classified into ng - type and sd - type ( see also fig . 4 in the main text ) .",
    "this is fully consistent with our microscopic observation of pattern evolution @xcite , strongly supporting the llt scenario @xcite .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : reverse ] shows the @xmath10-dependence of the glass transition behaviours during the reverse llt .",
    "the gradual continuous change of @xmath2 during the reverse llt transition suggests that this process may be sd - type transformation , which is consistent with its rather rapid transformation .",
    "finally we show the effects of ageing on the onset temperature of the glass transition by taking the data of @xmath67 k as an example .",
    "supplementary figure [ fig : ageing]a shows the dsc curves in the glass transition region for @xmath67 k , whereas supplementary figure [ fig : ageing]b plots the estimated onset temperature against the annealing time @xmath14 .",
    "we can see that the initial increase of @xmath2 is due to the ageing of glass 1 .",
    "the time region of the constant @xmath2 of glass 1 indicates that the ageing of glass 1 is completed after 10@xmath7 min . the final continuous increase after 10@xmath9 min is due to sd - type llt , which can be seen in supplementary figure [ fig : ageing]b ."

    "<S> recently , llt was also reported for metallic glass - formers @xcite . however , none of these examples is free from controversy . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more complicated for molecular liquids than for atomic liquids , since llt always takes place in a supercooled state metastable against crystallization for molecular systems @xcite . for atomic systems , on the other hand , the situation is better , since llt often takes place in an equilibrium liquid state : for example , it was shown that liquid p shows a first - order like transition from p4 tetrahedra to polymereric p chain structure @xcite and liquid s transforms into different polymeric structures upon heating @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the hottest and long - standing debates is on the nature of an unconventional amorphous state called `` glacial phase '' discovered by kivelson and his coworkers @xcite for a molecular liquid , triphenyl phosphite ( tpp ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that tpp is one of the most well - studied molecular systems which are expected to have llt . </S>",
    "<S> when tpp is kept at a low temperature near but still above the glass transition temperature @xmath2 ( @xmath3 k ) , a supercooled state of liquid 1 slowly transforms to an apparently amorphous state distinct from its ordinary glass state . </S>",
    "<S> since this transformation occurs above @xmath2 of liquid 1 , @xmath4 , the final amorphous state must not be a glass state of liquid 1 , glass 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that this phenomenon can naturally be explained by llt from liquid 1 to a glass state of liquid 2 , glass 2 @xcite . in this scenario , thus , the glacial phase is glass 2 . </S>",
    "<S> in the following , for simplicity , we use the term `` llt '' to express the transition between liquid 1 and liquid 2/glass 2 without distinguishing whether liquid 2 is in a liquid or glass state .    besides the llt scenario , </S>",
    "<S> many other explanations were also proposed for the nature of the glacial phase ; for example , the glacial phase was interpreted as a mixture of glass 1 and nano - crystals @xcite , a liquid crystal or plastic crystal @xcite , and an unconventional crystal called defect - ordered crystal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction data of the glacial phase formed at a very low temperature show only broad amorphous peaks and no sharp bragg peaks , indicating the absence of distinct translational order in the glacial phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this feature can not be explained by the plastic - crystal scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the glacial phase prepared at a very low temperature does not exhibit distinct birefringence @xcite , which can not be explained by the liquid - crystal scenario . on the other hand , the glacial phase formed at a rather high temperature exhibits not only weak birefringence @xcite but also small bragg peaks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can naturally be explained by the presence of nano - crystals in the glacial phase . </S>",
    "<S> then the question is whether the glacial phase is primarily glass 2 or just a mixture of glass 1 and nano - crystals whose size decreases with a decrease in the annealing temperature , at which the glacial phase is formed . in the latter scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the bragg peaks in the glacial phase formed at a very low temperature is ascribed to an extremely small size of nano - crystals .    </S>",
    "<S> such debates may also originate from the counter - intuitive impression about llt . according to classical liquid - state theory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the liquid state can be described by a single order parameter , density @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> provided that a liquid is in a random disordered state , it is hard to accept the presence of two liquids with different densities intuitively . </S>",
    "<S> however , once we accept that we need an additional scalar order parameter besides density to describe the state of a liquid , llt is no longer counter - intuitive and can be accepted naturally . on the basis of this idea and along the spirit of the pioneering works by strssler and kittel @xcite and rapoport @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we proposed a two - order - parameter model of liquid - liquid transition @xcite . in this picture , for example , llt in atomic systems like sulphur and phosphorous @xcite can be explained by the distinct change in the locally favoured structures stabilized by chemical ( or , covalent ) bonding . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , locally favoured structures can also be formed by directional hydrogen bonding for molecular liquids . according to our two - order - parameter model @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter governing llt is the fraction of locally favoured structures , @xmath6 , and then llt is regarded as a gas - liquid - like transition of the order parameter @xmath6 : liquid 1 is a gas - like state with low @xmath6 whereas liquid 2 is a liquid - like state with high @xmath6 . since locally favoured structures are created and annihilated independently , their number density is not conserved and thus @xmath6 is a non - conserved scalar order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> our recent x - ray scattering study @xcite revealed that upon llt of tpp locally favoured structures whose size is a few nm are formed and its number density monotonically increases with time , and accordingly liquid 1 and liquid 2 can indeed be differentiated by the fraction of locally favoured structures @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> here we note that liquid 1 is a stable high - temperature liquid and liquid 2 is a low - temperature liquid , which usually exists in a glass state ( glass 2 ) for tpp . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the two - order - parameter model of llt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the controversy has still remained due to the lack of direct experimental evidence for the presence of two liquid states and the reversibility of llt . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , no one have succeeded in avoiding nano - crystallization so far , which is due to an intrinsic difficulty associated with the fact that all the llts reported for molecular liquids such as tpp and water take place in a supercooled state below the melting point .    </S>",
    "<S> to firmly establish the llt scenario , it is desirable to show the reversibility of llt without suffering from any crystallization . for a heating rate </S>",
    "<S> less than 1 k s@xmath7 , however , the reverse llt is hidden behind crystallization , even if it exists , since crystallization takes place immediately after the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition during heating @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> terashima et al . observed an endothermic ( heat absorbing ) peak upon heating , which they attributed to the reverse llt on the basis of the heating rate dependence of the onset temperature of the peak @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if this is the reverse llt , we should also observe a glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition during heating before glass 2 goes back to liquid 1 , since the process of the reverse llt should occur only in a liquid state and not in a glass state . </S>",
    "<S> but they reported only one endothermic peak . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , with a slow heating rate employed in the previous studies , it is impossible to access the entire reverse process from the glacial phase to liquid 1 due to the interference by crystallization . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is still unclear whether the peak is due to the melting of nano - crystals , the glass 2-to - liquid 2 transition , and/or the reverse llt process .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we aim at not only showing the reversibility of llt but also confirming the coexistence of the two ` liquid ' states in the course of the transition in an unambiguous manner . </S>",
    "<S> these are crucial for proving that the transition takes place between two distinct liquid states . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we apply ultra high - speed ( flash ) dsc ( differential scanning calorimetry ) , which can provide a heating rate more than 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional dsc ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to avoid crystallization upon heating and to directly access the reverse process of llt without the interference by crystallization . </S>"
