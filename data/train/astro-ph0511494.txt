    "@xcite ( for a clear introduction see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this theory does not include an important process of the tidal destruction of small clumps inside the bigger ones .",
    "this process has been taken into account in our previous work @xcite , where it was demonstrated that only a small fraction of the small - scale clumps survives the tidal destruction in the hierarchical clustering .",
    "nevertheless , even this small fraction of survived small - scale clumps is enough to dominate the dm annihilation rate for the most reasonable spectra of primordial fluctuations .",

    "we use a simplified approach by calculating an energy gain per each tidal interaction and a number of tidal interactions per dynamical time in the hosts .",
