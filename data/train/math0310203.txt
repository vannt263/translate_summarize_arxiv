    "it turns out that the signature function is a locally constant function away from the ( possibly empty ) set @xmath6 of roots of the alexander polynomial on the unit circle . in view of this , the interesting part of the signature function is its _ jumping behavior _ on the set @xmath7 .    in other words",

    "the signature of a knot may be defined using a seifert surface of a knot ( see section [ sub.symmetries ] below ) .",
    "an intrinsic definition of the jump function of a knot was given by milnor @xcite , using the blanchfield pairing of the universal abelian cover of a knot .",
    "this definition , among other things , makes evident the role played by the roots of the alexander polynomial on the unit circle ( as opposed to the rest of the roots of the alexander polynomial , which are ignored ) .    from the point of view of gauge theory and mathematical physics ,",
    "the signature function of a knot may be identified with the spectral flow of a 1-parameter family of the signature operator , twisted along abelian ( that is , @xmath0-valued ) representations of the knot complement .    the moduli space of @xmath0 representations of the knot complement is well understood ; it may be identified with the unit circle .",
    "on the other hand , the moduli space of @xmath1 representations is less understood , and carries nontrivial topological information about the knot and its dehn fillings , as was originally discovered by casson ( see @xcite ) and also by x - s .",
    "lin ; see @xcite .",
    "one may ask to identify the @xmath0 representations which _ deform to _ irreducible @xmath1 representations . using a linearization argument ,",
    "klassen and frohman showed that a necessary condition for a @xmath0 representation @xmath17 to deform is that @xmath18 .",
    "this brings us to the ( square of the ) set @xmath7 .",
    "conversely , frohman - klassen proved sufficiency provided that the alexander polynomial has _ simple roots _ on the unit circle ; see @xcite .",
    "herald proved sufficiency under the ( more relaxed condition that ) the jump function vanishes nowhere ; see @xcite .",
    "it is unknown at present whether sufficiency holds without any further assumptions .",
    "let us summarize the two key properties of the jump divisor @xmath19 , in the spirit of mazur ( see @xcite ) :    * the jump divisor controls the signature function of a knot .",
    "* the jump divisor controls ( infinitesimally ) deformations of @xmath0 representations of the knot complement to irreducible @xmath1 representations .",
    "it is a long standing problem to find a formula for the  function of a knot in terms of its _ colored jones function_. the latter is a sequence of jones polynomials associated to a knot .",
    "recall that given a knot @xmath3 and a positive integer @xmath20 ( which corresponds to an @xmath20-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath21 ) , one can define a laurrent polynomial @xmath22 $ ] .    in @xcite , rozansky considered a repackaging of the sequence @xmath23 .",
    "namely , he defined a sequence of rational functions @xmath24 for @xmath25 with the following properties :    * @xmath26 for some polynomials @xmath27 $ ] with @xmath28 and such that @xmath29 .",
    "* for every @xmath20 we have : @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 $ ] is the ring of formal power series in @xmath32 with rational coefficients    equation is often called the _ euler expansion _ of the colored jones function . in physical terms , the above expansion is an asymptotic expansion of the chern - simons path integral of the knot complement , expanded around a backround @xmath0 flat connection .",
    "thus , philosophically , it should not be a surprise to discover that this expansion has something to do with the signature of the knot .",
    "for the curious reader , let us point out that rozansky conjectured such an expansion for the full kontsevich integral of a knot , graded by the negative euler characteristic of graphs ( thus the name , euler expansion ) .",
    "this conjecture was proven by kricker and the author ; @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a close relation was discovered between residues of the rational functions @xmath33 at roots of unity and the lmo invariant of cyclic branched coverings of the knot ; @xcite . in an attempt to understand the euler expansion , a theory of finite type invariants of knots ( different from the usual theory of vassiliev invariants )",
    "was proposed in @xcite . according to that theory , two knots are @xmath34-equivalent iff they are @xmath35-equivalent ; @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 is a finite type invariant of type @xmath36 .",
    "technically , the euler expansion of the colored jones function is an integrality statement .",
    "namely , it is easy to see that there exist unique sequence of power series @xmath37 $ ] for @xmath25 that satisfies equation .",
    "the hard part is to show that these power series are taylor series expansions of rational functions with integer coefficients and prescribed denominators .",
    "the statement @xmath28 in the leading term of the euler expansion is nothing but the melvin - morton - rozansky conjecture , proven by bar - natan and the author in @xcite .",
    "thus , the leading order term in the euler expansion is a well - understood topological invariant of knots .",
    "ever since the euler expansion was established , it has been a question to establish a topological understanding of the lower order terms .",
    "consider @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "we will think of @xmath40 as a function ( with singularities ) defined on the unit circle .",
    "if @xmath41 is a root of the alexander polynomial on @xmath11 , we may expand @xmath42 around @xmath43 .",
    "the result is a power series with lowest term @xmath44 , for some integer @xmath45 and some nonzero real number @xmath46 .",
    "let us define the _ jones jump function _ of a knot @xmath3 @xmath47 by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the imaginary part of a complex number @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the _ sign _ of a real number @xmath52 is defined by @xmath53 or @xmath54 according to @xmath55 or @xmath56 respectively .",
    "we say that a knot @xmath3 is _ simple _ if its alexander polynomial @xmath57 has simple roots on the unit circle .",
    "if @xmath3 is simple , then @xmath58 .",
    "a modest corollary is :    if @xmath3 is simple , conjecture [ conj.1 ] implies that the colored jones function of @xmath3 determines the signature @xmath16 .",
    "notice that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus , it suffices to check the conjecture on the upper semicircle .",
    "the conjecture is false if @xmath57 has multiple roots ( of odd or even multiplicity ) .",
    "for example , consider the connected sum @xmath61 of @xmath20 right trefoils .",
    "then , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we present the following evidence for the conjecture :    @xmath64 conjecture [ conj.1 ] is true for torus knots , and for knots with at most 8 crossings .",
    "+ @xmath65 the conjecture is compatible with the operations of mirror image , connected sum ( assuming the resulting knot is simple ) and @xmath66 parallels of knots .    en route to establish our results , we give a skein formula that uniquely characterizes the jump function of simple knots ; see theorem [ thm.unique ] .",
    "let us compare conjecture [ conj.1 ] with existing conjectures about the structure of the colored jones function .",
    "at the time of the writing , there are two conjectures that relate the colored jones function to hyperbolic geometry .",
    "namely ,    * the _ hyperbolic volume conjecture _ , after kashaev and j&j.murakami , which states that for a hyperbolic knot @xmath3 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 . * the _ characteristic equals deformation variety conjecture _ , due to the author , which compares the deformation curve of @xmath69 representations of a knot complement ( viewed from the boundary ) with a complex curve which is defined using the recursion relations ( with respect to @xmath20 ) of the sequence @xmath23 ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hyperbolic volume conjecture is an analytic statement , which involves the existence and identification of a sequence of real numbers .    on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic equals deformation variety conjecture is an algebraic statement , since it is equivalent to the equality of two polynomials with integer coefficients , one of which is obtained by noncommutative elimination , and the other obtained by commutative elimination .",
    "conjecture [ conj.1 ] appears to be an analytic conjecture , since its basic ingredients are signs of real numbers . in the field of quantum topology",
    ", analytic conjectures have held the longest .",
    "let us end the introduction with the following    understand the underlying geometry and perturbative quantum field theory behind the taylor expansion of the @xmath70 function ( and more generally , euler expansion of the colored jones function ) .",
    "in particular , use the higher order terms @xmath33 in the expansion to formulate a conjecture for the jump function of all knots .",
    "the author wishes to thank s. orevkov , l. rozansky and a. stoimenov , and especially j. levine for helpful conversations .",

    "@xmath72 , for @xmath73 .",
