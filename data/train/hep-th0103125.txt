    "generally speaking , dimensions of space - time may become a critical restriction on an allowed law of interaction in that space - time .",
    "for example , the inverse - square law of gravitational and electromagnetic forces can be considered to be resulted from the fact that the dimensions of space - time is `` 3 + 1 '' .",
    "this also is related to the fact that the huygens principle holds only in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "@xcite the number `` 3 + 1 '' , the dimensions of our space - time , is really a magic number .",
    "this kind of restriction may be expected in other space - time dimensions .",
    "the modern technology of engineering makes possible to produce low - dimensional electron systems in realistic electronic devises .",
    "especially , in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional systems , novel phenomena as the quantum hall effect  @xcite and the high-@xmath0 superconductivity  @xcite were discovered .",
    "it is plausible that these phenomena may have their origins in the dimensions of the space - time .    in a sense ,",
    "the dimensions `` 2 + 1 '' is more mysterious because the mathematics tells us that there exists a specific term called a chern - simons term  @xcite .",
    "this term is allowed just in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "as is well known , the lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field is given by the maxwell term , which is ( i ) gauge invariant , ( ii ) lorentz invariant , and ( iii ) bilinear for the gauge field .",
    "the chern - simons term also satisfies all of ( i ) @xmath1 ( iii ) .",
    "therefore the maxwell theory has a natural extension which is defined by adding the chern - simons term to the maxwell lagrangian .",
    "this extended version is called the maxwell - chern - simons theory .",
    "@xcite thus the restriction of the space - time dimensions to `` 2 + 1 '' opens a pass to a new type of theory .",
    "in fact , there appeared many approaches to understand these macroscopic quantum effects by using ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum field theories with and without the chern - simons term .",
    "for example , the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( @xmath2 ) has been used to explain the quantum hall effect , and @xmath2 with the chern - simons term ( maxwell - chern - simons @xmath2 ) has provided the anyon model which is expected to give an essential mechanism for the high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "@xcite these investigations have produced important results and are now still in progress .    what is the physical meaning of the chern - simons term ?",
    "the chern - simons term gives the gauge field a mass without breaking the gauge symmetry .",
    "@xcite this mass is called a topological mass because the chern - simons term has a topological meaning as the secondary characteristic class .",
    "@xcite whether the gauge field is massless or massive affects the nature of interactions , e.g. , the range of interactions . in this case ,",
    "the most important effect of the massive gauge field is to rescue the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional maxwell theory from the infrared catastrophe which appears in a self - energy of fermion when the maxwell field interacts with matters .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , it is known that nonperturbative radiative corrections can produce a mass of fermion called a dynamical mass .",
    "the dynamical mass generation of four - component fermions in @xmath2 without the chern - simons term has been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "one four - component fermion is equivalent to two two - component fermions .",
    "the mass term of the two - component fermion breaks the parity ( @xmath3 ) symmetry while the one of the four - component fermion breaks @xmath4 ) symmetry . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "one of the present authors and others have investigated the dynamical mass generation of a single two - component fermion in @xmath2 without the chern - simons term . a parity - breaking solution which generates the dynamical mass has been found .",
    "both analyses have been extended to the cases with the chern - simons term .",
    "the study of the four - component dynamical mass in the maxwell - chern - simons @xmath2 has been done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dynamical mass generation of a single two - component fermion in the maxwell - chern - simons @xmath2 has been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "especially , ref.@xcite is motivated to clarify a role of the topological mass in the nonperturbative dynamics .    however , as was pointed out in ref.@xcite , the estimation of the dynamical mass for a very small value of the topological mass is very difficult technically and also is highly nontrivial . in this paper , we extend further the analysis of ref.@xcite to the case in which the topological mass has much more smaller value .",

    "we have found that the deviation of @xmath70 from @xmath91 is less than 1 % .",
    "we may say that @xmath70 is almost equal to 1 in all region of @xmath89 .",

    "@xcite    in other words , b(0 ) reproduces the result of perturbation in the region of @xmath98 , and in the region of @xmath99 , b(0 ) is close to the nonperturbative value obtained in the case without chern - simons term .",

    "the value is changed to a nonperturbative value rapidly .",
    "the transition from the perturbative value to the nonperturbative one is sharp but not critical . though it seems not to be a phase transition , the inclusion of the chern - simons term changes the nature of the theory drastically .",
    "the most plausible application of our results can be found in condensed matter physics . it will be considered extensively in forth coming papers .",
    "what we would like to stress in this opportunity is an application to a model in the early universe . in a study of space - time evolution of the universe ,",
    "the finite temperature effect may become important . in an imaginary time formalism",
    ", an inverse of the time dimension with a periodic ( anti - periodic ) boundary condition for a boson ( fermion ) is interpreted as a temperature .",
    "then in a high - temperature limit , the time dimension vanishes and a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time collapses into 3-dimensional space in which the euclidean version of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models may become effective .",
