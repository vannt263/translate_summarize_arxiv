    "the dynamics of spinor becs is described by a three - component gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) system of equations . in the one - dimensional approximation the gp system goes into the following multicomponent nonlinear schrdinger ( mnls ) equation in 1d @xmath6-space @xcite : @xmath7 we consider becs of alkali atoms in the @xmath0 hyperfine state , elongated in @xmath6 direction and confined in the transverse directions @xmath8 by purely optical means .",
    "thus the assembly of atoms in the @xmath0 hyperfine state can be described by a normalized spinor wave vector @xmath9 whose components are labeled by the values of @xmath10 .",
    "the above model is integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform method @xcite .",
    "it also allows an exact description of the dynamics and interaction of bright solitons with spin degrees of freedom .",
    "matter - wave solitons are expected to be useful in atom laser , atom interferometry and coherent atom transport .",
    "it could contribute to the realization of quantum information processing or computation , as a part of new field of atom optics .",

    "they point out the importance of integrable cases , which take place for particular choices of the coupling constants .",

    "we formulate the lax representations for the models .",
