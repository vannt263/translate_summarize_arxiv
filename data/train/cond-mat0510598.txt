    "the cubic laves compound tibe@xmath10 was already shown forty years ago to have quite unusual behavior of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath11 and the knight shift.@xcite @xmath12 showed a strong increase with lowering temperature but a clear deviation from curie - weiss form , while the knight shift was temperature dependent and negative .",
    "the magnetic properties of tibe@xmath10 have been controversial since matthias _",
    "et al._@xcite interpreted the susceptibility peak at 10 k in tibe@xmath10 as itinerant antiferromagnetism ( afm ) with an associated magnetic moment of 1.64@xmath13 , and stewart _ et al .",
    "_ reported a transition at 2 k that seemed characteristic of magnetic ordering .",
    "however , a clear picture has emerged gradually after the idea of weak itinerant antiferromagnetism had been abandoned because of the subsequent lack of experimental evidence@xcite .",
    "many experiments have shown that tibe@xmath10 is instead a strongly enhanced paramagnet @xcite and undergoes a metamagnetic transition@xcite ( field - driven ferromagnetism ) around 5.5 t. also one can see similarity to the magnetic behavior of ni@xmath14ga by comparing the values of the low temperature susceptibility , @xmath15 emu / mole for ni@xmath14ga@xcite and @xmath16 emu / mole for tibe@xmath10@xcite .",
    "based on the magnetization data of monod _",
    "et al_@xcite wohlfarth@xcite suggested the transition at 5.5 t should be first order .",
    "wohlfarth s considerations received at least partial support from theoretical band - structure considerations coupled with the de haas - van alphen data of van deursen _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "clarity began to arise with the extensive experiments of acker _ et al . _ who interpreted their magnetization data@xcite in fields to 21 t and the magnetization data of monod _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite as evidence for exchange - enhanced paramagnetism or spin fluctuations in tibe@xmath10 .",
    "they found the system tibe@xmath17cu@xmath18 to become fm at a critical concentration @xmath19 .",
    "et al._@xcite measured the specific heat of tibe@xmath10 ( @xmath20mj / mole k@xmath21 ) at low temperature in 0 and 7 t and interpreted the behavior as evidence of spin fluctuations .    the isoelectronic isostructural material zrzn@xmath10 is considered a classic example of an weak itinerant ferromagnet .",
    "magnetic measurements find very small magnetic moments ( values from 0.12 to 0.23 @xmath13 ) @xcite , hence the characterization as a weak ferromagnet .",
    "the magnetization of zrzn@xmath0 increases substantially with field , but unlike tibe@xmath0 with its metamagnetic transition , the increase continues smoothly to fields as high as 35 t. the curie temperature t@xmath22 drops approximately linearly with pressure , from 29 k at @xmath23 to 4k at @xmath24 kbar , which extrapolates to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) at @xmath25 kbar .",
    "the report of superconductivity coexisting with ferromagnetism in zrzn@xmath10 near this qcp@xcite enlivened both theoretical and experimental attention , but more recently it has been shown@xcite there is no bulk superconductivity .",
    "tibe@xmath0 , on the other hand , has been nearly addressed only rarely for the past twenty years .",
    "the complex temperature - field behavior of tibe@xmath0 has led to many speculations about the microscopic mechanisms .",
    "of course spin fluctuations play a central part , and the highly enhanced susceptibility suggests this system is near a quantum critical point ( at slightly enlarged lattice constant , say , as well as for the cu alloying ) .",
    "if fm fluctuations dominate , then a metamagnetic transition ( field - driven fm state ) around 5 t would make sense .",
    "if afm fluctuations dominate , application of a field suppresses the fluctuations , providing another way to interpret specific heat under applied field.@xcite the anomalies in the conduction electron spin resonance ( cesr ) linewidth@xcite around 2 k have been interpreted in terms of a thermal spontaneous magnetism,@xcite and a decrease in the resistivity is also seen at that temperature.@xcite all of these scenarios are sensitive to the fermi surface shape , velocity spectrum , and possibly the energy dependence of the density of states near the fermi energy , and it is these questions that we address in this paper .",
    "band structure intricacies by themselves also can come into play .",
    "shimizu showed@xcite that an independent electron system with magnetic coupling can undergo a first - order transition to a `` spontaneous thermal magnetism '' state ( within a range @xmath26 ) if it is highly enhanced and if the fermi level lies within a local minimum in the density of states . the effects of magnetic fluctuations should of course be added@xcite to the free energy of both the ordered and disordered phases to make this treatment more realistic .    local density approximation ( lda ) energy band studies of tibe@xmath10",

    "@xmath29 is the stoner exchange interaction averaged over the fermi surface .",
    "thus , as for a few cases that have come to light more recently,@xcite ferromagnetism is incorrectly predicted , indicating the need to account for magnetic fluctuations not included in lda that will suppress magnetic ordering . by comparing the calculated value of n(e@xmath27 ) with the measured susceptibility ,",
    "a stoner enhancement s = [ 1 - @xmath28]@xmath31 60 was obtained , making tibe@xmath0 a more strongly exchange enhanced metal than pd .",
    "all of these calculations , carried out 25 years ago , used shape approximations for the density and potential , and for a detailed investigation of the weak ferromagnetism precise electronic structure methods are required . in this work , the precise self - consistent full potential linearized - augmented - plane - wave ( flapw )",

    "we have applied the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis ( fplo ) scheme within the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite in these scalar relativistic calculations we used the exchange and correlation potential of perdew and wang.@xcite ti @xmath38 states and be @xmath39 were included as valence states .",
    "all lower states were treated as core states .",

    "the spatial extension of the basis orbitals , controlled by a confining potential @xmath41 , was optimized to minimize the total energy .",

    "there is still the question of how much of the measured field dependence is due to this induced exchange splitting , and how much is due to the effect of the field on the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "many of the results we have obtained here are strongly dependent on details of the band structure and the position of the fermi level . that these results reflect realistically the mechanisms underlying the many fascinating observations obviously requires that the band structure formalism is applicable in detail to such systems and that the calculations are accurate .",
    "another requirement is that of high sample quality , that the stoichiometry is precise and that defect concentration must be very low ( simple impurity broadening will affect behavior ) .",

    "<S> we address the origin of the incipient magnetism in tibe@xmath0 through precise first principles calculations , which overestimate the ferromagnetic tendency and therefore require correction to account for spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> tibe@xmath0 has sharp fine structure in its electronic density of states , with a van hove singularity only 3 mev above the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the isovalent weak ferromagnet zrzn@xmath0 , it is flat bands along the k - w - u lines of hexagonal face of the fcc brillouin zone make the system prone to magnetism , and more so if electrons are added . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the moriya @xmath1 coefficient ( multiplying @xmath2 in the fluctuation susceptibility @xmath3 ) is divergent when the velocity vanishes at a point on the fermi surface , which is very close ( 3 mev ) to occurring in tibe@xmath0 . in exploring how the fm instability ( the @xmath4=0 stoner enhancement is @xmath5 ) might be suppressed by fluctuations in tibe@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate that the moriya a coefficient ( of @xmath6 ) is negative , so @xmath4=0 is not the primary instability </S>",
    "<S> . explicit calculation of @xmath7 shows that its maximum occurs at the x point @xmath8 ; tibe@xmath0 is thus an incipient _ anti_ferromagnet rather than ferromagnet as has been supposed . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that simple temperature smearing of the peak accounts for most of the temperature dependence of the susceptibility , which previously had been attributed to local moments ( via a curie - weiss fit ) , and that energy dependence of the density of states also strongly affects the magnetic field variation of @xmath9 . </S>"
