    "it is well known that a non - trivial spectral profile of the vacuum fluctuations produces observable effects .",
    "one important example in this category is the quantum vacuum near reflecting boundaries , which is directly related to various applications ; casimir effect , quantum effects in the early universe , quantum noise in a gravitational - wave detector , and so on .",
    "one way of probing such non - trivial vacuum fluctuations is to study the brownian motion of a test particle released in the vacuum in question @xcite .",
    "another approach is , for instance , to investigate the interaction between a mirror and the nearby vacuum fluctuations  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the velocity dispersions of the brownian motion of a charged test particle in the quantized electromagnetic vacuum near a perfectly reflecting , flat boundary .",
    "( let us assume that the boundary coincides with the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane ( @xmath2 ) for later convenience . )",
    "this analysis is along the line of some preceding studies on the quantum brownian motion , among which the case of an uncharged , polarizable test particle  @xcite and the case of a charged test particle  @xcite are closely related to the present one .",
    "we here , however , would like to pay special attention to the influence of the switching process in measuring the velocity dispersions .",
    "the reason why we focus on the switching process is as follows . in ref .",
    "@xcite , yu and ford calculated the velocity dispersions of a classical charged particle in the electromagnetic vacuum near a reflecting boundary , assuming a _ sudden switching _ process . here",
    "the  sudden switching \" process indicates the measurement process in which the detector is abruptly turned on and turned off at the time @xmath3 and @xmath4 , say , respectively .",
    "they reported that the @xmath5-component of the velocity dispersion of the test particle , @xmath6 , does not vanish in late time , but shows an asymptotic late - time behavior @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is some constant ) .",
    "they interpreted this behavior as a transient effect due to a sudden switching process .",
    "however , a sudden switching may not be very realistic in view of the uncertainty principle between time and energy since the sudden switching implies that a coupling between the field and the particle is switched on / off instantaneously with some finite energy exchange .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the late - time behavior of @xmath6 does not depend on the main measuring time @xmath9 suggests that there should be cancellation during the time @xmath9 .",
    "if so , the switching tails at the edge of the main measuring process might have significant influence on the result .",
    "it is desirable , thus , to reanalyze the same system under a more realistic measuring process with smooth switching tails and to see how the late - time behavior of the measured @xmath6 depends on the switching process .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to undertake this analysis .",
    "we will see that , contrary to the macroscopic measurements , the measurement of the quantum vacuum fluctuations is considerably influenced by the switching tails in a highly non - trivial manner . in particular the anti - correlation between the main measuring part and the switching tails plays an essential role .",
    "there are three time - scales characterizing the present system as is discussed below .",
    "we also study how the results depend on the time scales to get basic ideas about when switching is regarded as  smooth \" or  sudden \" .    the quantum switching effect analyzed here is expected to find various applications related to non - stationary aspects of the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "[ sec : review ] , we first review some basic results of the case of sudden switching discussed in @xcite , and then we show that a smooth switching process do lead to a totally different result . in sec .

    "we find that a particular anti - correlation between the main measuring part and the switching tails plays an essential role in the measuring process .",

    "contrary to the case @xmath121 ( @xmath117 ) , the first term @xmath122 in eq.([eq : intmodel ] ) , which comes purely from the @xmath58-region , is now a regular integral due to @xmath119 and it exactly matches the original result of the step - function case shown in ref.@xcite ( eq.([eq : shortasympt ] ) ) .",
    "physically , it corresponds to the situation in which the measuring time @xmath41 is so short that the information exchange between the mirror and the particle has not yet taken place .",
    "therefore it is expected that the presence of the reflecting boundary does not play a vital role in this case .",
    "this is why the integral for @xmath122 is regular when @xmath118 .    on the other hand , @xmath123 , which comes from the @xmath59- and @xmath60-regions ,",
    "is given by a singular integral .",
    "the appearance of the singular integral is understood as the long - tail nature of the lorentzian function . though the measuring - part is too short to cause correlations due to the reflecting boundary",
    ", the long tails of the switching - part still pick up correlations . by a regularization",
    ", @xmath123 is given by ^2 _ s & & + & ~ &  .",

    "it is curious that @xmath124 does not contain any singular integral when @xmath128 although the lorentzian switching tails take part in @xmath124 .",
    "the reason may be that this sector contains the description of cancellations between the pre- and post - measurement tails ( the @xmath60 region ) .    leaving only the most dominant terms",
    ", we get the estimation ^2 & &   ( for   _ 1 < 1 )  , [ eq : dv2zearly ] + & & o(1 )   ( for   _ 1 > 1 )  , [ eq : dv2zearly2 ] where eq.([eq : dv2zearly ] ) comes from the @xmath58-region and coincides with eq.([eq : shortasympt ] ) , while eq.([eq : dv2zearly2 ] ) comes from the @xmath59- , @xmath60- and @xmath61-regions .",
    "in the present paper , the effect of a switching process upon the measurement of the brownian motion of a charged test particle near a perfect reflecting boundary has been investigated .",
    "we have started with the fact that the late - time asymptotic behavior of @xmath129 does not depend on the measuring time @xmath41 but only on the distance to the boundary , @xmath5 , when the sudden - switching is employed ( eq.([eq : asymptoticz ] ) )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41-independence suggests that effective cancellations should be taking place during the measuring process and , if so , the result should be sensitive to the switching - tails at the edge of the measuring part .",
    "this is a natural reasoning considering the highly fluctuating nature of the vacuum . in the measurement of a normal system ,",
    "the switching effect is likely to be ignored if the measuring time - scale is much larger than the switching time - scale .",
    "when dealing with the quantum vacuum like the present case , however , the highly fluctuating vacuum might cause the cancellations during the main measuring process so that the switching effect can also be an important ingredient .",
    "next we have proceeded to calculate the velocity dispersion with a lorentzian function , which represents a pure smooth switching - process without a flat measuring part .",
    "we have then shown that the result is very different from the sudden - switching case ( eq.([eq : lorentzasympt ] ) ) .    finally constructing the lorentz - plateau switching function ,",
    "we have shown that the result is very sensitive to the switching tails in probing the quantum vacuum .",
    "we have also derived a reasonable criteria for the switching to be regarded as  sudden \" or  smooth \" . only the condition that the switching time - scale @xmath42 is much smaller than the measuring time - scale @xmath41 is not enough",
    "for the switching to be qualified as  sudden \" . as clarified in [ sec : reanalysis ] ( the case ( i ) there ) , the criteria for the validity of the sudden - switching approximation should be @xmath130 as well as @xmath131 , where @xmath5 is interpreted as the traveling time of a signal from the particle to the reflecting boundary .",
    "the above criteria , however , may not be easy to be satisfied so that the sudden - switching approximation should be taken care more carefully when we consider an actual procedure of measurement .",
    "we can imagine an example for measuring @xmath129 as follows .",
    "assume a wide conducting plate of a square shape ( the edge size @xmath132 ) is fixed in the vacuum .",
    "for clarity of the argument , let us introduce the standard @xmath133-coordinates in such a way as the plate is contained in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane with the original point o being at the center of the plate . from a distant point @xmath134 ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) ,",
    "a charged particle is shot parallel to the plate with an incident velocity @xmath137 .",
    "the particle initially goes in the empty space far away from the plate and then passes near the edge of the plate , and finally enters into the region bounded by the plate .",
    "the smooth switching function discussed in the paper would be interpreted as a mathematical description of this process of shooting a probe from a far distance . in this situation ,",
    "the switching time scale is around @xmath138 and the intrinsic time - scale determined by the system configuration is @xmath5 .",
    "it is obvious that the switching time - scale can not be smaller than the intrinsic time scale @xmath5 in this case , since @xmath139 .",
    "this is just one example , but it at least shows that the sudden - switching approximation is not valid all the time and that we should be more careful about the switching effect in dealing with the quantum vacuum .    in view of the above example",
    ", it might also be possible to look at the switching function from a different angle , i.e. as a mathematical description of what the test particle would experience when the vacuum shifts from the minkowski vacuum to a casimir - like vacuum .",
    "based on this interpretation , it is not surprising to see @xmath129 remain constant in the late - time , depending only on @xmath5 for the sudden switching case . for",
    ", it is interpreted as the sudden energy shift due to the sudden change of vacuum state . in the case of the pure lorentzian switching - function , on the other hand",
    ", the corresponding interpretation is that the vacuum changes smoothly from the asymptotic minkowski vacuum to the casimir - like vacuum , going back to the asymptotic minkowski vacuum again .",
    "then the test particle is never stabilized in this varying vacuum so that the result is naturally so different from the sudden switching case",
    ". then the setup using lorentz - plateau function in this connection would be interpreted as describing a smooth transient process from the minkowski vacuum to the casimir - like vacuum .",
    "thus it is expected that the lorentz - plateau function constructed in the present paper might be very useful to analyze the situations such as a smooth transient from one vacuum to another .",
    "finally it is appropriate to make some comments on the singular integrals and their regularization procedure .",
    "tracing back the origin of the singular integral , it comes from the singularity at @xmath29 in the integral kernel ( eq.([eq : kernel ] ) or eq.([eq : ezez ] ) ) .",
    "this singularity is understood as produced by the reflecting boundary . due to the mirror - reflections of signals with the light - velocity ,",
    "the values of the electric field at the two world - points @xmath140 and @xmath141 are expected to be strongly correlated when @xmath142 .",
    "these correlations accumulate in the velocity fluctuations of the particle at @xmath5 when the measurement time @xmath9 is longer than the travel time @xmath10 for the signals .",
    "it is natural , thus , to expect that the resulting singular terms of the form @xmath143 ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) contain the information on the reflecting boundary .",
    "however the standard regularization procedure@xcite corresponds to discarding these singular terms in effect .",
    "it should be clarified when this type of regularization is valid and when not .    with the above physical interpretation of the singular integrals ,",
    "another natural way of regularization should be possible .",
    "it has been assumed that the probe particle and the reflecting boundary or the mirror are treated as classical objects .",
    "however in reality they also can not escape quantum fluctuations .",
    "taking into account their quantum fluctuations , the effective path - lengths of signals are expected to be vague .",
    "it is estimated that the quantum fluctuations of the probe particle are more significant than those of the mirror .",
    "it is natural to assume the effective size of the particle to be of the order of its compton length @xmath146 , corresponding to setting the infinitesimal parameter @xmath147 to be @xmath148 . just for an illustration ,",
    "let us consider the case of an electron ( @xmath149 cm ) with @xmath150 @xmath44sec . then @xmath151 .",
    "it turns out that , thus , the singular terms would all the time dominate in the velocity fluctuations .",
    "since the results could be drastically influenced , it should also be clarified whether the cut - off type of regularization is valid .",
    "we would like to thank l. h. ford for various helpful comments on many aspects on the present research .",
    "we here analyze general properties of the integral given in eq.([eq : intbasic ] ) or eq.([eq : intbasic2 ] ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane is divided into 9 integral regions by 4 border lines , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , and the 9 regions are further classified into 4 classes , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as discussed after eq.([eq : intbasic2 ] ) . in each integral region",

    "first of all , the two limiting cases of @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , can be easily obtained ( let us once again recall @xmath44 is the switching - duration parameter defined in eq.([eq : mu ] ) ) : on the one hand , we see & & i_m=2 ^ 2 _ 0 ^ 1 dx  ( 1-x ) k ( x ) + as @xmath168 with a fixed @xmath9 ( or equivalently @xmath170 with a fixed @xmath9 ) .",
