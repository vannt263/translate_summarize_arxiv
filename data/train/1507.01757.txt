    "there is a common and widely shared vision that next generation wireless networks will witness the proliferation of small - cells . as a matter of fact",
    ", researchers foresee network densification as one of key enablers of the 5 ^ -th^ generation ( 5 g ) wireless networks @xcite .",
    "although it refers to a concept rather than being a precise definition , the term _ ultra - dense networks _ is used to describe networks characterized by a massive and dense deployment of small - cells , in which the amount of base stations may grow up to a point where it will exceed the amount of user devices @xcite .    as",
    "wireless networks evolve , performance requirements for the new technology are becoming more and more stringent .",
    "in fact , the 5 g requirements are set to a data rate increase up to a 1000-fold with respect to current 4 g systems@xcite , as well as for high energy efficiency @xcite in order to limit the energy expenditure of network operators .",
    "supported by recent results @xcite , cell densification as been put forward as the main enabler to achieve these target data rates .",
    "for example , the authors in  @xcite have shown that the throughput gain is expected to grow linearly with the density of base stations per area ; this is a result of the simplified system model used during the investigation .",
    "namely , the assumption of a single slope path - loss model and that all base stations in the network are active .",
    "nonetheless , further work on cell densification has shown that , under less ideal assumptions , network performance may be different than what predicted in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when different path - loss models than single slope are used , the actual performance of cell densification is less optimistic than what estimated with single slope path - loss @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the base station density increases beyond the user density , like in a typical ultra - dense scenario , the network has been shown to experience a coverage improvement at the expense of a limited throughput gain @xcite .",
    "this implies that a larger number of bss will need to be deployed to meet a given data rate target , translating on higher network infrastructures costs .      in recent years",
    ", stochastic geometry has been gradually accepted as a mathematical tool for performance assessment of wireless networks .",
    "in fact , one of the most important contribution to the study of cell densification can be found in  @xcite , where the authors proposed a stochastic geometry - based framework to model single - tier cellular wireless networks ; by assuming a single slope path loss model , the authors have observed the independence of the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) and spectral efficiency ( se ) from the bs deployment density , with the main consequence being the linear dependence of the ase on the cell density .",
    "nevertheless , when the assumption of single - slope path - loss is dropped , it emerges that sinr , ase and coverage exhibit a different behaviour than what was found in  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite considered propagation models for millimeter waves . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors extended the stochastic geometry framework proposed in  @xcite to a multi - slope path loss model .",
    "the authors in  @xcite developed a stochastic geometry framework for path - loss including line - of - sight ( los ) and non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) propagation for millimeter - waves .",
    "the effect of nlos propagation on the outage probability has been studied in  @xcite , where the authors propose a function that gives the probability to have los at a given point depending on the distance from the source , on the average size of the buildings and on the density of the buildings per area . a stochastic geometry - based framework to study",
    "the performance of the network with a combined los / nlos propagation for micro - waves can be found in some previous work of ours @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the common picture that emerges from the work @xcite is that of a non - linear behavior of the ase with the cell density ; overall , as a consequence of a different propagation model than the single slope path - loss , the spectral efficiency and coverage of the network do actually depend on the base station density .",
    "however , all these studies are based on the assumption of fully loaded networks , i.e. , all the base stations are active and have at least one user to serve ; thus , the applicability of the work above is limited to networks in which the density of base stations is lower than that of the users .",
    "in our paper , we broaden the study of network densification to the the case where there is no such a constraint in terms of bs density , i.e. , we also tackle partially loaded networks , in which some base stations might be inactive .",
    "work on stochastic geometry for partially loaded networks has been advanced in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied the coverage in single tier networks , while multi - tier networks are addressed in @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the area spectral efficiency of partially loaded networks has been carried out in @xcite , while in @xcite the authors have extended the stochastic geometry - based model further to include multi - antenna transmission , and have also assessed the energy efficiency .",
    "overall , the authors in @xcite have shown that the network coverage improves as the base station density increases beyond the user density ; this is paid in terms of a lower throughput gain , which grows as a logarithmic function of the cell density .",
    "nonetheless , the authors in @xcite modeled the propagation according to a single slope path - loss model and did not investigate the effect of los / nlos propagation in partially loaded networks .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , currently there is no work that addresses ultra - dense scenarios with path - loss models different than the single slope for both fully and partially loaded networks . as a result of the combined effect of the path - loss model and of the partial load in ultra - dense networks ,",
    "until now the behavior of the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) , coverage , and energy efficiency as the networks become denser , was unknown .",
    "this paper seeks to investigate the cell densification process in ultra - dense networks and evaluate the effect of los / nlos propagation on performance metrics such as coverage , spectral efficiency , area spectral efficiency , and energy efficiency .",
    "specifically , we use _ ultra - dense networks _ as a term to refer to those networks characterized by a very high density of base stations and that include both the cases of _ fully loaded networks _",
    "( i.e. , networks in which all the base stations are active ) and _ partially loaded networks _",
    "( i.e. , networks in which some base stations might be inactive and not transmit to any user ) .",
    "overall , the major contributions of our work can be summarized in the following points :    * 1 ) stochastic geometry - based model for ultra - dense networks with los/ nlos propagation : * we propose a model based on stochastic geometry that allows us to study the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) distribution , the spectral efficiency and the area spectral efficiency of ultra - dense networks where the propagation has los and nlos components .",
    "we build on previous work @xcite and we adapt the model proposed by andrews et al . to the case of los",
    "/ nlos propagation .",
    "in addition , our framework takes also into account the partial load of ultra - dense networks , in which a fraction of base stations may be inactive .",
    "* 2 ) study of cell densification , partial load and frequency reuse in networks where signal follows los / nlos propagation : * first , we investigate the effect of network densification on performance metrics such as sinr , spectral efficiency and area spectral efficiency in networks where the path - loss follows the los / nlos propagation . in particular , the ase gain becomes lower than linear at high cell densities , meaning that a larger number of bss would be necessary to achieve a given target with respect to the case of single slope path loss .",
    "moreover , the network coverage drops drastically as the bs density increases .",
    "then , we show that the performance drop due to los / nlos propagation gets mitigated by the usage of frequency reuse or if the base station density exceeds the user density , as it is likely to occur in ultra - dense networks . to the best of our knowledge , the combined effect of los / nlos propagation and partial load / frequency reuse has not been addressed before .    *",
    "3 ) investigation on the minimum transmit power per bs and energy efficiency for networks where signal propagates according to los / nlos path - loss : * as the cell density increases , the transmit ( tx ) power per base station can be lowered .",
    "we evaluate the minimum tx power per bs such that the network is guaranteed to be in the interference - limited regime , in which case the performance is not limited by the tx power .",
    "second , we make use of the tx power to determine the energy efficiency of the network when the propagation has los and nlos components .",
    "we show that the energy efficiency with los / nlos propagation drops considerably with respect to the case of single slope path - loss , making cell - densification costly for the network from an energetic stand - point .",
    "we further extend the study of the energy efficiency to frequency reuse and partial load .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : systemmodel ] we describe the system model .",
    "we show our formulation for computing the sinr , se and ase in section  [ sect : sinr_se_ase ] and we address the energy efficiency in section [ sec : energy_efficiency ] . in section  [",
    "sect : results ] we present and discuss the results while the conclusions are drawn in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we consider a network of small - cell base stations deployed according to a homogeneous and isotropic spatial poisson point process ( sppp ) , denoted as @xmath0 , with intensity @xmath1 .",
    "further , we assume that each base station ( bs ) transmits with an isotropic antenna and with the same power , @xmath2 , of which the value is not specified , in order to keep our model general and valid for different base station classes ( e.g. , micro - bss , pico - bss , femto - bss ) ; we focus our analysis on the downlink .      in our analysis , we considered the following path loss model : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the path - loss exponents for los and nlos propagation , respectively ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the signal attenuations at distance @xmath8 for los and nlos propagation , and @xmath7 can either refer to the signal attenuations at distance @xmath8 m or @xmath8 km ; this depends on the actual values given for the parameters of the channel model .",
    "] respectively ; @xmath9 is the probability of having los as a function of the distance @xmath10 .",
    "the model given in is used by the 3gpp to model the los / nlos propagation , for example , in scenarios with heterogeneous networks  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table a.2.1.1.2 - 3 ) .",
    "the incorporation of the nlos component in the path loss model accounts for possible obstructions of the signal due to large scale objects ( e.g. buildings ) , which will result in a higher attenuation of the nlos propagation compared to the los path .",
    "we further assume that the propagation is affected by rayleigh fading , which is exponentially distributed @xmath11 .    regarding the shadow fading",
    ", it has been shown that in networks with a deterministic , either regular or irregular , base station distribution affected by log - normal shadow fading , the statistic of the propagation coefficients converges to that of a network with sppp distribution as the shadowing variance increases @xcite .",
    "in other words , this sppp intrinsically models the effect of shadow fading .      to ensure that our formulation and the outcomes of our study are general and not limited to a specific los probability pattern , we consider two different los probability functions .",
    "the first one , which is proposed by the 3gpp  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table a.2.1.1.2 - 3 ) to assess the network performance in pico - cell scenarios , is given below : @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being two parameters that allow to match the measurement data .",
    "unfortunately , this function is not practical for an analytical formulation . therefore , we chose to approximate it with a more tractable one , namely : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a parameter that allows   to be tuned to match  .",
    "the second function is also suggested by the 3gpp  ( * ? ? ? * table a.2.1.1.2 - 3 ) and is given below : @xmath17 from a physical stand point , the parameter @xmath16 can be interpreted as the los likelihood of a given propagation environment as a function of the distance .      in our model , we always assume that : ( i ) the users are uniformly distributed ; ( ii ) that each user s position is independent of the other users position ; and ( iii ) each user connects only to one base station , the one that provides the strongest signal .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the density of users per area ; whenever we consider a finite area @xmath19 , @xmath20 indicates the average number of users in the network .",
    "we also assume the users are served with full buffer , i.e. , the base station has always data to transmit to the users and make full use of the available resources .",
    "depending on the ratio between the density of users and the density of base stations , we distinguish between two cases , namely , fully loaded and partially ( or fractionally ) loaded networks . by fully loaded networks we refer to the case where each bs has at least one user to serve . with reference to a real scenario ,",
    "fully loaded networks model the case where there are many more users than base stations , so that each base station serves a non - empty set of users .",
    "however , when the density of users is comparable with or even less that of base stations , some base stations may not have any users to serve and would then be inactive , meaning that they do not transmit and do not generate interference .",
    "when this occurs , we say that the network is partially loaded .",
    "the network can be modelled as partially loaded to study those scenarios characterized by high density of base stations and , in particular , scenarios where the density of base stations exceeds the density of users , such as in ultra - dense networks .    to define formally the concepts of fully and partially loaded networks , we first need to introduce another concept , which is the _ probability",
    "a base station being active_.    [ def : probability_of_activity ] the probability of a base station being active , denoted as @xmath21 , is the probability that a base station has at least one user to serve .",
    "this event implies that the base station is active and transmits to its users .",
    "[ def : fully_partially_loaded ] the network is said to be fully loaded if @xmath22 ; the network is said to be partially or fractionally loaded if @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we propose an analytical model to compute the sinr complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) , which allows us to asses key performance metrics such as coverage , spectral efficiency and ase .      in order to compute the sinr tail distribution ( i.e. , the complementary cdf ) ,",
    "we extend the analytical framework first proposed in  @xcite so that to include the los and nlos components . from the slivnyak s theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem8.10 ) , we consider the  _ typical user _ as the focus of our analysis , which for convenience is assumed to be located at the origin .",
    "the procedure is composed of two steps : ( i ) we compute the sinr ccdf for the typical user conditioned on the distance from the user to the serving base station , denoted as @xmath24 ; ( ii ) using the pdf of the distance from the closest bs @xmath25 , which corresponds to the serving bs , we can average the sinr ccdf over all possible values of distance @xmath24 .",
    "let us denote the sinr by @xmath26 ; formally , the ccdf of @xmath26 is computed as : @xmath27=\\mathrm{e_{r}}\\big[\\mathrm{p } \\left[\\gamma",
    "> y|r\\right]\\big ] = \\int _ { 0}^{+\\infty } \\mathrm{p}\\left[\\gamma > y|r = r\\right]f_{r}(r)\\mathrm{d}r.\\ ] ] the key elements of this procedure are the pdf of the distance to the nearest base station @xmath28 and the tail probability of the sinr conditioned on @xmath24 , @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the methodology to compute each of these elements while modelling the los and nlos path loss components will be exposed next .",
    "the set of the base stations locations originates an sppp , which we denote by @xmath30 . and use @xmath31 and instead of @xmath32 for convenience of notation .",
    "] as a result of the propagation model we have adopted in our analysis ( see section  [ subsect : channelmodel ] ) , the user can either be in los or nlos with any base station @xmath32 of @xmath33 .",
    "now , we perform the following mapping : we first define the set of los points , namely @xmath34 , and the set of nlos points , @xmath35 .",
    "then , each point @xmath32 of @xmath33 is mapped into @xmath34 if the base station at location @xmath32 is in los with the user , while it is mapped to @xmath35 if the base station at location @xmath32 is in nlos with the user . since the probability that @xmath32 is in los with the user is @xmath36",
    ", it follows that each point @xmath32 of @xmath33 is mapped with probability @xmath36 into @xmath34 and probability @xmath37 into @xmath35 .",
    "given that this mapping is performed independently for each point in @xmath33 , then from the `` thinning theorem ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.36 ) it follows that the processes @xmath34 and @xmath35 are sppps with density @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "note that , because of the dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath41 on @xmath31 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are inhomogeneous sppps . to make the formulation more tractable , we consider @xmath34 and @xmath35 to be independent processes ; because the union of two sppps processes is an sppp of which the density is the sum of the densities of the individual sppps ( * ? ? ?",

    "hence , the assumption of independence between @xmath34 and @xmath35 does not alter the nature of the process @xmath33 .",
    "given that we have two inhomogeneous sppp processes , it is not trivial to obtain the distribution of the minimum distance of the user to the serving base station , which will be necessary later on to compute the sinr cdf .",
    "in fact , assuming the user be in los with the serving base station at a distance @xmath43 , there might be an interfering bs at a distance @xmath44 which is in nlos with the user .",
    "this is possible because the nlos propagation is affected by a higher attenuation than the los propagation .",

    "this is in line with what one would expect from frequency reuse .",
    "nonetheless , if we have no constraint in the choice of the bs density , the ase vs coverage trade - off improves as the frequency reuse factor increases .",
    "in fact , the trade - off curve we obtain for a given reuse factor @xmath215 lies on the top - right hand side with respect to the curve for reuse factor @xmath216 .",
    "this means that , by increasing the reuse factor and the base station density at the same time , it is possible to achieve better performance than with a lower frequency reuse factors ; note , though , that this is true when there is no constraint in terms of bs density .    by looking at the single slope pl curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ase_coverage_tradeoff ] , it appears that higher frequency reuse factors should still be preferred in order to improve the ase vs coverage trade - off .",
    "however , unlike with the los / nlos path loss , increasing the bs density enhances the ase with no loss in terms of network coverage . yet , modelling the signal propagation with the combined los / nlos path loss yields different results than with the single - slope pl .      in this subsection",

    "[ fig : prob_a_vs_density ] ) . at the same time , as @xmath1 increases , the distance from ue to the serving bs tends to decrease , leading to an increment of the received power .",
    "overall , the fact that @xmath94 saturates whereas the received power keeps growing as @xmath1 increases has a positive impact on the sir ; as a result , the outage probability ( see fig . [",

    "thus , if the channel attenuation between the interferer and the user decreases quickly as the density increases , a lower transmit power will be enough to guarantee that the interference power is greater than the noise power .",

    "<S> this paper aims at investigating the achievable performance and the issues that arise in ultra - dense networks ( udns ) , when the signal propagation includes both the line - of - sight ( los ) and non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) components . backed by an analytical stochastic geometry - based model , we study the coverage , the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) and the energy efficiency of udns with los / nlos propagation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when los / nlos propagation components are accounted for , the network suffers from low coverage and the ase gain is lower than linear at high base station densities . </S>",
    "<S> however , this performance drop can partially be attenuated by means of frequency reuse , which is shown to improve the ase vs coverage trade - off of cell densification , provided that we have a degree of freedom on the density of cells . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from an energy efficiency standpoint , cell densification is shown to be inefficient when both los and nlos components are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> overall , based on the findings of our work that assumes a more advanced system model compared to the current state - of - the - art , we claim that highly crowded environments of users represent the worst case scenario for ultra - dense networks . </S>",
    "<S> namely , these are likely to face serious issues in terms of limited coverage .    ultra - dense , los / nlos , area spectral efficiency , partially loaded , energy efficiency , coverage . </S>"
