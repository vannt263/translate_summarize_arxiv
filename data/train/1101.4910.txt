    "in order to make a consistent comparison and for sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to leading - order ( lo ) accuracy , where the partonic cross - sections for the production of squarks and gluinos in hadron collisions were calculated at the born level already quite some time ago @xcite .",

    "we do not consider in detail top squark production where these assumptions do not hold and which require a more dedicated treatment  @xcite .    the invariant cross section for single gluino production can be written as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the parton distributions of the incoming protons and @xmath45 is the lo partonic cross section @xcite for the subprocesses involved .",

    "we can ask if the same occurs in nuclear processes , and answering this question is also a goal on this article .",
    "let us now focus on gluino production in nuclear collisions .",
    "the calculation is done as explained in the previous section , replacing the parton distributions in the free nucleon ( @xmath57 in eq .",

    "another possible choice , a @xmath47 running @xmath60 scale , would push some of the npdf s outside the region of valididy ( eps08 and eps09 are frozen in @xmath61 for values above that scale , whereas ds is not valid in that region ) . for this reason ,",
    "the ds could not be considered in the sps9 scenario ( see table i ) , with extra large gluino masses . to start with , we consider the sps1a scenario as the first ( most optimistic ) choice of gluino and squark masses .    in fig .",

    "[ gluinoaa ] we present a similar analysis for the transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modification factor defined by @xmath69 for gluino production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc ( @xmath70 tev ) . in this case ,",
    "the nuclear effects are amplified because of the presence of two nuclei . besides , the probed values of @xmath11 are pushed into very high-@xmath11 due to the smaller center of mass energy . indeed , the eps supression increases with @xmath47 in a stronger way than in the pa case ( around @xmath26 for higher @xmath47 ) .",
    "the ds npdf has an enhancement pattern , increasing with @xmath47 , which shows that this distribution has reached the fermi motion effect in the very right side of fig .",
    "the enhancement is also larger for the hkn , above @xmath71 with a very tiny increasement with @xmath47 .",
    "it seems that , if the latest eps09 npdf is the more correct distribution , the gluino production will be slightely suppressed compared with @xmath55 collisions at the same energy , whereas the ds and hkn suggests that there will be some enhanced production of gluinos in nuclear collisions .",
    "the possible increasement of the gluino production rate in nuclear collisions ( compared with pp collisions at same energy ) shown above is in fact too low to really improve the small feasibility of detecting the gluinos when going from pp to pa and aa .",
    "in fact , the higher hadronic activity in nuclear collisions make the detection of gluinos more difficult , and the smaller cm energy available produces a smaller number of gluinos compared to 14 tev pp colisions .",
    "the expected luminosity to be reached in the aa collisions ( @xmath72 ) @xcite is seven orders of magnitude smaller than in the pp mode ( @xmath73 ) , and this is the main limitation to detecting nuclear gluinos ( they will be produced but will hardly be seen ) . in the pa mode , one expects a luminosity of @xmath74 @xcite , which becomes @xmath75 assuming a full lhc year @xmath76 ( one usually considers a month ion running time @xmath77 ) in the ion mode . with only our lo estimation , and considering the more suppressed eps09",

    "it has been suggested that the pa luminosity could eventually be upgraded to @xmath78 @xcite , in this case our estimate would increase to 430 gluinos in one year run . for more realistic estimates , the nlo correction would still increase the cross - sections for the various production processes by up to a factor of less than two @xcite .",

    "this dependence is indirect , since the gluino and squark masses ( @xmath52 , @xmath80 ) , are the only parameters that really affect the results , but these masses are consequences of the different susy breaking parameters in the different sps scenarious .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ gluinoaasps ] , where different sps scenarious give different absolute values for the @xmath79 nuclear ratios ( this can be seen by comparing for example the starting point of each curve ) .",
    "the @xmath47 growth for the ds npdf is even more steeper for the higher mass sps scenarious ( higher @xmath11 ) . for the sps9 scenario ,",
    "the results should not be trusted , since most parametrizations are not valid in that region : the hkn predicts an enhancement essentially constant with @xmath47 , and the frozen eps s supression decreases with @xmath47 .",
    "because of the odd interplay of nuclear effects and susy breaking scenarios , one needs to put better constraints on the nuclear pdf s before describing precisely gluino production in nuclear collisions .",
    "conversely , the discovery and measurement of the gluino and squark masses will be important in the searches for sparticles produced in nuclear collisions , taking into account the correct nuclear effects which also depend on the those masses .",
    "to conclude , in this work we studied the nuclear effects in pa and aa gluino production at the lhc .",
    "we have shown different results of enhancement or suppression depending on the nuclear pdf , the effects being smaller in pa interactions and larger in nuclei collisions .",
    "gluinos will probably be copiously produced in the @xmath55 channel .",
    "once the details of gluino production are known in @xmath55 interactions , studying this final state in @xmath81 and @xmath82 collisions could give unprecedented constraints on the npdfs in a heretofore unexplored region of @xmath83 .",
    "one could use the higher energy to get a good measurement of gluino production and search for deviations from that in the measurable @xmath47 range for @xmath81 and @xmath82 to measure quark and gluon shadowing at very high scales where nothing at all is known about it .",
    "uncertainties on the npdf s ( and cold matter effects in general ) , and on the susy breaking scenarios ( which give different masses for the gluinos and squarks ) has to be disentangled in the future searches . for heavy nuclei collisions , where its expected the formation of the quark gluon plasma , it may appear other channels where gluino is produced . here",
    "we only investigated cold matter effects , namely the shadowing of the nuclear distributions .",

    "<S> the variety of nuclear effects may also be relevant for gluino production , since there are contributing diagrams with both ( anti)quarks and gluons in the initial state .    in the case of gluino production </S>",
    "<S> , because of the large gluino masses , the values of @xmath11 probed tend to be quite high ( from @xmath33 to almost @xmath34 ) , and then the antishadowing , emc effect and even fermi motion may be important ( depending on the kinematic region and nuclear pdf ) , which may enhance the gluino production rate compared to that obtained from single nucleon collisions at the same energy . therefore , whereas the smaller center of mass energy ( 5.5 tev ( aa ) and 8.8 tev ( pa ) ) will reduce the gluino production rates ( compared to 14 tev ( pp ) ) , there may be an enhancement due to the amount of quarks and gluons on the nuclear medium compared with the nucleon parton distributions on a single proton , due to high density nuclear effects . in this work </S>",
