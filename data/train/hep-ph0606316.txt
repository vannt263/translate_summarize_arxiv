    "a plasma is a statistical system of charged particles which move randomly , interact with themselves and respond to external disturbances .",
    "therefore , it is capable of sustaining rich classes of physical phenomena .",
    "screening of charges , damping of plasma modes , and plasma oscillations are important collective phenomena in plasma physics  @xcite . a proper description of such phenomena may be obtained if we know how a plasma will respond macroscopically to a given external disturbance .",
    "the microscopic features of the particle interactions in the plasma are not completely lost in such a macroscopic description .",
    "but they can be implemented in a response function through the ways in which the mutually interacting particles adjust themselves to the external disturbance and the response function plays a crucial role in determining the properties of the plasma  @xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , it has been found that at high temperature @xmath1 the color charge is screened  @xcite and the corresponding phase of matter was named quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it is a special kind of plasma in which the electric charges are replaced by the color charges of quarks and gluons , mediating the strong interaction among them .",
    "such a state of matter is expected to exist at extreme temperatures , above @xmath2 mev , or densities , above about @xmath3 times normal nuclear matter density .",
    "these conditions could be achieved in the early universe for the first few microseconds after the big bang or in the interior of neutron stars . in accelerator experiments high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "are used to search for the qgp .",
    "these collisions create a hot and dense fireball , which might consist of a qgp in an early stage ( less than about @xmath3fm/@xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "since the masses of the lightest quarks and of the actually massless gluons are much less than the temperature of the system , the qgp is an ultrarelativistic plasma . to achieve a theoretical understanding of the qgp , methods from quantum field theory ( qcd ) at finite temperature are adopted @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd should work at high temperatures far above the phase transition where the interaction between the quarks and gluons becomes weak due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "an important quantity which can be derived in this way is the polarization tensor describing the behavior of interacting gluons in the qgp .",
    "the dielectric function is related to the polarization tensor and important properties of the qgp , such as the dispersion relation of collective plasma modes and their damping or the debye screening of color charges in the qgp  @xcite .",
    "recent numerical lattice calculations have found that charmonium states remain bound at least up to @xmath5  @xcite and the behavior of temporal correlators in pseudoscalar and vector channels deviates significantly from the free behavior at @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "these analysis suggested _ that pseudoscalars and vectors resonances may exist above @xmath7_. also robust results from au+au at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have shown collective effects known as radial  @xcite and elliptic  @xcite flows , and a suppression of high-@xmath8 hadron spectra  @xcite , which could possibly indicate the quenching of light quark and gluon jets  @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical description  @xcite of the observed collective flow indicates that the matter produced at rhic _ behaves like a near - perfect fluid_. on the other hand , the amount of jet quenching might depend on the state of matter of the fireball , i.e. , qgp or a hot hadron gas .",
    "there are extensive theoretical efforts in understanding the effect of the medium on jet quenching  @xcite using collisional as well as radiative energy loss since the high energy partons traveling through a medium will lose energy owing to the interactions in the medium .",
    "recently ruppert and mller  @xcite have studied the wake of the in - medium jet physics assuming a fast moving color charge particle with high momentum in a qgp within the framework of the linear response theory , considering two different scenarios : ( i ) a weakly coupled qgp as described by hard thermal loop ( htl ) perturbation theory and ( ii ) a qgp with the properties of a quantum liquid . in both cases the wake of the medium , i.e. , qgp , has been observed through the induced charge and current densities due to dynamical screening but only in the latter case ( ii ) the wake exhibits a oscillation analogous to cerenkov like radiation with a mach cone structure .",
    "we point out here that their analysis within the htl perturbation theory is not complete . in this paper",
    "we revisit their analysis within the htl perturbation theory extending our investigations of dynamical screening  @xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we restricted ourselves to the outward flow of the wake potential and to small particle velocities ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "also in the two - body potential for describing parton - parton interaction and bound states we did not include the magnetic interaction . here",
    "we will show that both effects should not be neglected in the case of high - energy partons .",
    "furthermore , in our earlier study we concentrated only on the screening aspect of the wake potential , whereas here we will discuss also the relationship to the energy loss and dynamic aspects ( oscillations , flow ) .    in particular , we find oscillations in the wake structure behind a fast moving color charge akin to cerenkov like radiation and mach cone .",
    "we further show that the wake potential for incoming flow is much like a coulomb potential , while the potential in the outward flow flips its sign due to dynamical screening .",
    "in addition a potential perpendicular to the motion of the parton is also calculated which indicates a transverse flow in the qgp .",
    "we further compute a color dipole potential considering two moving charges and discuss the consequences of possible new bound states , _ viz .",
    "_ , colored bound states , and @xmath0 suppression in the qgp .",
    "an appropriate description  @xcite of various plasma properties can be obtained if one knows how a plasma responds to an external disturbance . in order to establish a response relationship in a plasma",
    ", one usually considers the plasma response to the external electric field which induces a current density .",
    "if the system is stable against such a disturbance whose strength is weak , then the induced current may appropriately be expressed by that part of the response which is linear in the externally disturbing field .",
    "the _ linear response _ of a plasma to an external electromagnetic field has extensively been studied  @xcite in plasma physics in which the external current is related to the total electric field by @xmath10   \\vec{e}^a_{\\rm{tot } } ( \\omega,\\vec { \\mathbf   k } ) , \\label{ejrel}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the dielectric tensor , describing the linear ( chromo)electromagnetic properties of the medium and @xmath12 is the identity operator .",
    "since we are interested in a system of a relativistic color charge moving through a qcd plasma , we apply the linear response theory for the purpose in the same spirit as in  @xcite by simply assigning a color index , @xmath13 , to the relevant quantities here and also in the subsequent analysis to take into account the quantum and non - abelian effects .",
    "non - abelian effects ( beyond the color factors , e.g. , in the debye mass ) will be important at realistic temperatures . unfortunately , they can not be treated by the method used by ruppert and mller  @xcite and are therefore beyond the scope of this work as we closely follow their work in our analysis .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly outline the theoretical description  @xcite based on the linear response theory for the qgp as a finite , continuous , homogeneous and isotropic dielectric medium , which can be expressed by a dielectric tensor , @xmath14 , depending on the direction only through the momentum vector , @xmath15 .",
