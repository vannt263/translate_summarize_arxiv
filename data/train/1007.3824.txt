    "recently , soft materials such as colloidal and granular systems have attracted considerable interest owing to their rich behaviours .",
    "for instance , such systems can be in a supercooled state under conditions of low temperatures and high densities @xcite .",
    "under such conditions , a characteristic time acts as a function of system parameters such as temperature or density , and often obeys a non - arrhenius law , which substantially influences the properties of the materials .",
    "understanding the mechanism of such anomalous dynamical behaviours in many - body systems is important in the field of statistical physics .",
    "kinetically constrained spin model ( kcsm ) is a simple model that follows the non - arrhenius law @xcite . thus far",
    ", it has been rigorously proved that the characteristic times in some kinds of kcsm on finite - dimensional lattices show super - arrhenius type and vogel - fulcher type behaviours @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a kcsm on a bethe lattice , another non - arrhenius type behaviour of a characteristic time has been found by monte carlo simulations @xcite . from a static aspect ,",
    "this non - arrhenius type behaviour is due to a nonergodic transition corresponding to @xmath0-core percolation ; this transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "concretely , at this percolation point , the characteristic time diverges with a power law ( non - arrhenius law ) ; this divergence is supposedly controlled by a mode - coupling equation @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned mode - coupling equations are also believed to be related with the anomalous dynamical behaviours of colloidal or granular systems .",
    "a related conjecture is that a finite - dimensional system mimics a nonergodic transition described by a mode - coupling equation in a mean field sense although it is not a true nonergodic transition but a strong finite - size effect @xcite . in the case of kcsm",
    ", it has been rigorously proved that the nonergodic transition observed specifically in a kcsm on a bethe lattice does not occur in the model on a finite dimensional lattice although there are the strong finite - size effects arising from the nonergodic transition on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "this leads us to consider whether the mechanisms of the appearance of such strong finite - size effects for different finite - dimensional systems have common features . in order to resolve this problem ,",
    "it is necessary to find a relationship between kcsm and mode - coupling equations .",
    "however , the mode - coupling equation describing the nonergodic transition has not been derived yet for kcsm on bethe lattices : there have been some related studies on the derivations of mode - coupling equations for kcsm @xcite .    in this paper , as a preliminary step to understand such a relationship , we attempt to clarify the dynamical aspect of the universality class of the nonergodic transition observed in fredrickson - andersen model ( a kcsm ) on a bethe lattice .",
    "concretely , we derive approximately dynamical systems from this model using a perturbation analysis which provides exact final states as stationary solutions above the nonergodic transition .",
    "we find that the universal class of the nonergodic transition can not be captured by each dynamical systems even at any order by itself .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the differences between the time - dependent solutions of the derived dynamical systems and the results obtained by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are systematically reduced on a perturbation series .",
    "furthermore , we find that this systematic perturbation analysis clarifies the existence of a dynamical scaling law , which provides a implication for a universal relation between a size scale and a time scale near the nonergodic transition .",

    ", @xmath236 can be regarded as the quantity connecting the perturbation order @xmath171 to accessible minimal rearrangement size by the perturbation analysis with order @xmath171 . in other words , if we obtain a exact value of @xmath236 such that @xmath237 in a certain case of @xmath238 , the values of @xmath239 in any cases @xmath240 can be derived by the perturbation analysis presented above , because the analysis provides @xmath241 in any cases of @xmath200 , in principle .",
    "the result for @xmath234 leads to the conjecture that @xmath235 also does not depend on the value of @xmath215 with the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the universality classes of nonergodic transitions in the kinetically constrained spin model are classified by the value of constraint parameter @xmath0 , and the quantity characterizing the universality is not @xmath242 or @xmath243 but @xmath235 , where @xmath242 and @xmath243 depend on the value of @xmath215 .",
    "actually , we have performed the mc simulations in order to confirm the above conjecture .",
    "although we have found signs supporting the above conjecture , we could not obtain plausible results due to the finite size effects and the limitation of the maximum step of time .",
    "it is an important future study to confirm the conjecture by mc simulations .",
    "in this study , we have constructed a systematic perturbation analysis for the dynamics of fa model on a bethe lattice .",
    "this systematic perturbation analysis clarifies the existence of a dynamical scaling law , which provides a implication for a universal relation between a size scale and a time scale near the nonergodic transition .    here",
    ", we discuss the relevance of our results to the previous studies .",
    "actually it has been conjectured that the persistent time found by mc simulations can be described by a mode - coupling equation @xcite .",
    "this statement is not inconsistent with @xmath198 because mode - coupling equations are @xmath59-dimensional differential equations .",
    "in addition , a fact supporting the relevance of the model to a mode - coupling equation has been made in the literature of the analysis of the minimum size rearrangement @xcite .",
    "in addition to the previous results , the results obtained in this paper provide another plausible conjecture for the properties of the nonergodic transition .",
    "that is , the nonergodic transitions have a _ weak _ universality .",
    "this means that critical exponents @xmath244 for time and size depend on the value of @xmath215 , but the dynamical critical exponent @xmath235 does not depend on the value of @xmath215 with the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "a similar statement has been mentioned in the previous study for the dynamical transition in @xmath245-spin glass model on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "the study states that @xmath235 does not depend on the quantity @xmath246 related to the connectivity of the graph , which plays the similar role to that of @xmath215 in this paper .",
    "however , the study does not mention to the dependence of @xmath235 on the value of @xmath245 , which may play the similar role to that of @xmath0 in this paper .",
    "the results in this paper indicate that @xmath235 depends on the value of @xmath245 .",
    "the confirmation of this conjecture for the dynamical transition in @xmath245-spin glass model is an important future study .",
    "another aspect of this _ weak _ universality appears in the comparison to the case of a ferromagnetic ising model on a bethe lattice . in the previous study",
    ", the critical exponent can be obtained using the dynamical system closed by finite number of effective variables , which is derived by the similar approximation method to that of this paper @xcite .",
    "therefore , the universality class of nonergodic transition in the kcsm is quantitatively and qualitatively different from that of ferromagnet - paramagnet transition in some spin models including , at least , ising model . here",
    ", the word ` qualitatively ' means that the differences are located in not only the value of critical exponents and the existence of the dynamical system closed by finite number of variables capturing the critical exponent .",
    "finally , we discuss the relationship between nonergodic transitions discussed in this paper and the related phase transitions in other systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , a decimation dynamics of a random graph in the thermodynamic limit exhibits a saddle - node bifurcation at the @xmath0-core percolation point @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a random - field ising model with zero - temperature glauber dynamics in the thermodynamic limit at a spinodal transition has been reported to correspond to the @xmath0-core percolation , which is also a saddle - node bifurcation on bethe lattices @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that dynamical behaviours near these transitions corresponding to the saddle - node bifurcation are extremely different from the dynamics near the nonergodic transition in fa model although those are @xmath0-core percolations from the static viewpoint .",
    "this difference may be related to the existence of a no - passing property in the system @xcite .",
    "that is , fa model does not have a no - passing property whereas the other systems do .",
    "this consideration leads to the conjecture that the nonergodic transition in other kinetically constrained spin models such as kob - andersen models belong to universality classes that are different from that of the saddle - node bifurcation ; such models do not have the no - passing property @xcite . finally , we mention a previous study that suggests a relationship between the static properties of jamming transition and the @xmath0-core percolation in a previous study @xcite .",
    "since such a system showing the jamming transition do not have the no - passing property , finding a relationship between the macroscopic dynamical behaviors near the jamming transition and kcsm is also an interesting topic for future studies .",
