    "the essence of the brownian motion of mesoscopic particles suspended in a solvent has been understood since the pioneering works of einstein  @xcite and von smoluchowski  @xcite . today",
    ", brownian motion constitutes a basic paradigm of stochastic processes  @xcite with applications in numerous fields , which may even utilize the noise as by stochastic resonance  @xcite and brownian motors  @xcite , not forgetting important generalizations beyond classical statistical physics to quantum brownian system  @xcite and relativistic brownian motion  @xcite .    following einstein and von smoluchowski ,",
    "the statistics of the particle s trajectories is described in terms of a probability distribution for the displacement as was measured shortly after by perrin  @xcite relying on the newly developed dark field microscope .",
    "these displacements are cumulative , i.e. , they are the sum of many small steps , and provided the steps are uncorrelated , the central limit theorem applies .",
    "then for an unbiased random walk the probability cloud is described by a gaussian which broadens as time proceeds .",
    "the corresponding trajectories are continuous but almost nowhere differentiable curves , self - similar in a statistical sense .",
    "this picture obviously can not apply to the very small time and length scales where collisions with individual solvent molecules are resolved .",
    "nevertheless it seems plausible that on a coarse - grained time and length scale all correlations due to these molecular processes are rapidly suppressed and brownian motion emerges as mathematically described by a stochastic differential equation by langevin  @xcite with a wiener process as noise term .",
    "this established picture had to be reconsidered when alder and wainwright  @xcite showed in molecular dynamics simulations that the basic assumption of weakly correlated displacements is not fulfilled for the single particle motion in a fluid .",
    "rather they found a long - time anomaly @xmath0 in the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) due to the conservation of momentum in the fluid , where @xmath1 is the spatial dimension of the system .",
    "for a mesoscopic colloidal particle the direct experimental observation of these anomalies  la perrin was achieved only 100 years after einstein s work using high - precision photonic force microscopy  @xcite .",
    "the power law correlations persist even in the presence of a bounding wall where momentum can be transferred to , although they decay more rapidly  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we argue that quenched disorder constitutes a second generic mechanism for persistent correlations in the velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "it was shown in the late 60s that in the lorentz model , where a single tracer scatters ballistically in a random array of frozen hard obstacles , ring collisions lead to a nonanalytic dependence of the diffusion constant on the density of scatterers  @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism implies a power - law tail in the vacf  @xcite of the form @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "first , in contrast to alder s discoveries , the origin of this tail is not connected to momentum conservation , since the tracer exchanges momentum with the frozen scatterers .",
    "second , the persistent correlation is negative reflecting the caging due to the obstacles . here",
    "the correlations in the velocity are inherited from the configuration space since , loosely speaking , the particle remembers forever which paths are blocked by obstacles  @xcite .",
    "the predicted anomalies were soon partially confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite yet the prefactor of the tail was by an order of magnitude larger than expected . at higher densities",
    "the relaxation appears to become slower suggesting a density - dependent exponent  @xcite .",
    "later it was suggested that a second universal power law takes over as the the percolation threshold is approached  @xcite in qualitative agreement with a theoretical prediction obtained in a mode - coupling approach  @xcite .",
    "the scenario of a crossover behavior explaining the enhanced prefactor of the power law was fully confirmed only recently  @xcite .",
    "since the kinetic theory developed by weijland and van leeuwen  @xcite is rather involved , one is tempted to assume that their result constitutes a peculiarity of the lorentz model with few general consequences . in this paper",
    "we show that the long - time anomalies in the vacf persist in a system where particles move diffusively rather than ballistically through the course of obstacles .",
    "we calculate analytically the first systematic correction for the complete scattering function and specialize to low wavenumbers to obtain the vacf .",
    "the long - time tail emerges again due to repeated encounters with the same scatterer , yet the derivation of this result drastically simplifies compared to the ballistic case , since a diffusive tracer finds the same obstacle many times without requiring the series of boltzmann scattering events as the ballistic particle .",
    "we corroborate our analytic result by brownian dynamics simulations in the dilute regime and discuss the range of validity of the low - density expansion .",
    "last we conclude that frozen disorder generically entails long - time algebraic decay in the vacf irrespective of the microscopic dynamics implying that the basic assumption of quickly decaying correlations in brownian motion is generally not fulfilled in heterogeneous media .",
    "the notion of universal long - time anomalies also applies to hopping transport in disordered lattice models @xcite where again repeated encounters with the same scatterer lead to persistently correlated motion .",
    "there the vacf has been calculated up to second order in the obstacle density and the predictions have been nicely confirmed by computer simulation  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in the lorentz model randomly distributed , possibly overlapping obstacles of radius @xmath4 represent a random , frozen environment in which a single , point - like tracer particle moves .",
    "the dynamics of the tracer is considered as ballistic with elastic scattering whenever an obstacle is encountered . in particular ,",
    "energy is conserved and the particle s velocity remains constant in magnitude for all times .",
    "diffusion emerges after many collisions with the scatterer as the direction of the velocity is randomized .",
    "since the obstacles are distributed randomly and independently , the structures are characterized solely via the obstacle density @xmath5 .",
    "the only dimensionless control parameter is the reduced obstacle density @xmath6 .",
    "to lowest order in the obstacle density the motion of a ballistic particle in the course of obstacles is described by the lorentz - boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "there uncorrelated scattering events lead to diffusion on scales larger than the mean - free path @xmath7 . in this geometric problem the time scale is set by the mean collision time @xmath8 by means of the velocity @xmath9 of the particle .",
    "the corresponding diffusion coefficient @xmath10 diverges for small densities since it is due to the rare scattering events only that the ballistic motion becomes diffusive after all . via a series of these uncorrelated scattering events",
    "the particle may return to an already visited obstacle , giving rise to non - trivial correlations . to account for these repeated collision events ,",
    "one has to go systematically beyond the lorentz - boltzmann equation resulting in a non - analytic correction to the diffusion coefficient @xmath11 . in two dimensions , @xmath12 , to which we restrict the discussion in the following",
    ", one obtains  @xcite , @xmath13 where the lorentz - boltzmann diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath14 .",
    "uncorrelated scattering events predict an exponential decay in the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath15 with the mean collision rate @xmath16 .",
    "the repeated scattering from the same obstacle then introduces an algebraic tail @xmath17 reflecting the infinite memory of the motion in the disordered system .",
    "the amplitude diverges as the system becomes more and more dilute , yet since the initial value of the velocity autocorrelation function is density independent , @xmath18 , the time required to attain the tail is set by the growing collision time @xmath19 .",
    "provided time is measured in terms of @xmath19 , the tail is a small @xmath20 correction to the lorentz - boltzmann theory .    in summary , in the framework of the ballistic lorentz model the non - analytic dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath21 and the long - time anomaly emerge in a higher order correction beyond the lorentz - boltzmann theory .",
    "the lorentz model can be extended to particles that perform brownian motion in the void space , i.e the domain not excluded by the frozen scatterers . in the planar case , this might be a useful minimal model for the complex transport found in cellular membranes or models thereof  @xcite .",
    "the configuration of the environment is described by the centers of the obstacles @xmath22 in a finite hypercubic box of length @xmath23 .",
    "the density of the scatterers is kept fixed , @xmath24 , as the thermodynamic limit is performed . due to exclusion",
    ", the distance of the tracer to any of the obstacles always exceeds the radius of the scatterers , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed throughout for convenience .",
    "a complete statistical description is given in terms of the conditional probability density @xmath27 to find the particle at time @xmath28 at position @xmath29 provided it was known to be at @xmath30 at an earlier time @xmath31 .",
    "since the stochastic process is stationary , the conditional probability is time - translationally invariant and we choose @xmath32 in the following .",
    "the smoluchowski equation for @xmath33 is then simply the diffusion equation restricted to the void space @xmath34 where the nabla operator @xmath35 acts on the current position of the particle @xmath29 and now @xmath36 refers to the short - time diffusion coefficient . since the tracer particle can not penetrate the obstacles , this equation of motion has to be supplemented by the von neumann boundary condition @xmath37 i.e. , the flux through the boundary vanishes . to avoid difficulties with hard core repulsion",
    ", we consider for the moment a random potential consisting of finite spherical barriers , @xmath38 where , e.g. , @xmath39 with the heaviside step function @xmath40 , and the hard core limit @xmath41 is anticipated .",
    "then the _ propagator _ obeys the smoluchowski equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the thermal energy .",
    "analytic progress is made by studying the one - sided temporal fourier transform @xmath44 for complex frequencies",
    "@xmath45 in the upper half - plane , rather than studying the time dependence of the propagator @xmath46 directly .",
    "then the equation of motion translates to @xmath47 this form of the smoluchowski equation identifies @xmath48 as an inverse of the smoluchowski operator and constitutes the starting point for the elaborated framework of the scattering theory .",
    "the smoluchowski equation in the form of eq .   has a mathematical analogy to the time - independent schrdinger equation , allowing us to employ the techniques developed for the scattering problem of a quantum particle .",
    "first it is convenient to adopt an abstract bra - ket notation .",

    "the case of no obstacles leads to the unperturbed green function @xmath61 which satisfies @xmath62 simple operator algebra reveals that the full green function obeys the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath63 which yields upon iteration the born series with the first order approximation @xmath64 .",
    "the _ scattering matrix _ defined by @xmath65 advances solutions of the unperturbed problem to the full one @xmath66 .",
    "it is convenient to single out the event of no scattering and to define the _ t - matrix _ as @xmath67 .",
    "then the following identities are easily derived @xmath68 the first relation states that the t - matrix acts like an effective potential such that the full multi - scattering process is obtained in first born approximation .",
    "the second equation states how the t - matrix is obtained by iteration , @xmath69 implying that the multiple scattering events are categorized as single- , double- ,  scattering events .    in our case",
    "the scattering potential @xmath70 is a sum of single obstacle potentials differing merely in the position of the scatterer , and thus a _ multi - scattering expansion _",
    "is appropriate .",
    "let us define the corresponding single obstacle t - matrices via @xmath71 describing multiple scattering form a single obstacle @xmath72 .",
    "then the direct scattering expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scattering_expansion ] ) can be reorganized into @xmath73 where the first term accounts for the repeated scattering with the _ same _ scatterer , the second one repeated scattering with one scatterer followed by a series of scattering events with a _ different _ scatterer .",
    "the third term continues this series including scattering from a third scatterer , which may coincide with the first one .",
    "it is now clear how the term involving @xmath5 t - matrices is constructed : pick all sequences consisting of @xmath5 obstacles such that all neighboring pairs are distinct .",
    "these sequences are represented by multiplying the single obstacle t - matrices sandwiched with an unperturbed propagator .",
    "the multiple scattering expansion , eq .  ( [ eq : multiple_scattering_expansion ] ) , remains valid in the case of hard obstacles provided the single obstacle t - matrix is calculated via the full propagator of the single impurity problem analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_propagator ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the tracer depends on the details of its local environment .",

    "we use an approach which uses a mixed real - space momentum - space representation , making the calculation much more transparent .",
    "second we choose a formulation reminiscent of the scattering problem of a quantum particle of a hard disk using the hilbert space of the free motion as reference .",

    "the notion that correlations quickly die out at time scales beyond some characteristic relaxation time of the problem has been shown to be incorrect in general . besides the meanwhile established long - time anomalies due to momentum conservation in fluids  @xcite , a second paradigm leading to persistent correlations is identified .",
    "quenched disorder implies repeated encounters with the same obstacle , and the information encoded in the exclusion of the configuration space manifests itself in measurable quantities such as the mean - square displacement or the velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "previous studies focused on the ballistic motion in quenched disorder  @xcite where the theoretical analysis is quite involved , and the long - time anomalies could be considered as merely a peculiarity of the lorentz model .",
    "the identification of similar persistent correlations for hopping transport in disordered lattices  @xcite suggests that memory effects may apply to a much larger class of systems .",
    "here we have calculated the memory effects for a brownian particle in a random environment of hard scatterers to first order in the obstacle density .",
    "we conclude that the only ingredient necessary for the long - time tails is the frozen disorder .",
    "since disorder is ubiquitous in nature and the effects arise at all obstacle densities , we conclude that the power laws in the vacf are present for all real systems .",
    "we have confirmed our analytical results by computer simulation for brownian motion in a disordered array of obstacles .",
    "the brownian particle follows the first - order theory quantitatively at low densities and qualitatively for moderate ones confirming that the long - time anomaly persists for all densities where diffusion occurs in the long - time limit .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the first - order - density expansion gives a reliable picture for brownian dynamics , in contrast to the ballistic case .",
    "the brownian dynamics in the presence of hard obstacles displays a second power law in the vacf at short times which is due to single scattering events from an obstacle .",
    "these effects have no analog in the ballistic case nor in hopping transport in disordered lattices .    in the present study the unobstructed dynamics",
    "is considered to be a random walk where momentum does not play a role . for a colloidal particle suspended in a fluid and moving through a dilute course of obstacles",
    ", one may expect that both the vortex diffusion of momentum in the fluid as well as the repeated encounters with static obstacles leads to an algebraic long - time decay of the vacf . since the decay @xmath177 due to vortex diffusion for unconfined motion is slower than the one for the obstructed motion @xmath178 one may anticipate that momentum conservation is more important than steric hindrance at least for long times .",
    "yet , the obstacles can also carry away momentum and the vortex diffusion in the fluid should be cut off at time scales where the agitated fluid encounters an obstacle .",
    "for the case of a wall in three dimensions it has been shown that the long - time anomalies are suppressed  @xcite to @xmath179 rather than @xmath180 .",
    "hence , for a disordered system in a fluid a competition between both scenarios appears to be relevant , yet no theory is available .",
    "computer simulations for dense hard sphere liquids have indicated a crossover from a positive tail due to vortex diffusion as well as a negative tail in the densely packed regime , where the cages act as a quasi - frozen disordered environment  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology has been recently corroborated for lennard - jones particles @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic fluctuations in two - dimensional fluids lead to a series of divergences in the correlation functions .",
    "the diffusion coefficient in an infinite system is expected to be ( logarithmically ) divergent since the fluid can not carry momentum away fast enough . for a dilute density of static obstacles",
    "one may hope that some of these effects are regularized in a natural way , giving an intriguing interplay of non - analytic behaviors ; a theory for such a scenario , however , remains an open question .",
