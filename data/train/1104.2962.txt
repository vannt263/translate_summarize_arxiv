    "so , @xmath20 means belonging in @xmath4 _ and not _ in @xmath1 .",
    "] similarly , the @xmath21 mc events which contribute to @xmath1 are separated into those that end up in the same bin after detector simulation and event selection ( @xmath22 ) , and those that migrate to different bins ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the variables @xmath22 and @xmath17 are identical .",
    "so , @xmath12 can be expressed as a function of three statistically independent random variables : @xmath24 since @xmath12 is expressed as a function of three statistically uncorrelated variables , error propagation can be used where covariance terms are zero .",
    "each one of the three mc event populations has standard deviation @xmath25 .",
    "a relative systematic uncertainty of 15% in jet @xmath0 resolution was assumed , based on the results of in - situ studies @xcite .    to model the effect of a different @xmath0 resolution on @xmath12 ,",
    "the jets in mc events were smeared by an additional amount @xmath26 , which varied from 0 to 20% of the nominal smearing that is present in atlas mc . for each amount of extra smearing , the values of @xmath4 change , while @xmath1 is not affected . as a result",
    "each correction factor @xmath12 has a dependence on the amount of extra smearing .",
    "it was furthermore observed that in all bins @xmath2 the correction factor @xmath12 increased about linearly with @xmath26 .",
    "it is possible to increase the smearing of jet @xmath0 by adding to it a random offset of appropriate variance , but it is not possible to do the opposite , i.e. , to reduce the amount of smearing that is nominally present in the atlas mc .",
    "this complicates the task of determining the uncertainty on @xmath12 , because the resolution uncertainty of 15% is symmetric ; the jet @xmath0 resolution could be 15% worse or 15% better than its nominal value .",
    "the observation that @xmath12 depends linearly on the extra smearing justifies the assumption that , if the resolution improved , @xmath12 would decrease , linearly , at the same rate .",
    "therefore , the systematic uncertainty on @xmath12 due to 15% uncertainty on jet @xmath0 resolution is determined by noting the increase of @xmath12 when resolution is made 15% worse , and by symmetrizing this variation .",
    "for example , if @xmath12 changes by + 1% when jet @xmath0 resolution is deteriorated by 15% , we assign to @xmath12 a systematic uncertainty of @xmath27 .",
    "the correction factors @xmath12 depend on the choice of @xmath1 , which affects also @xmath4 . if , for example , pythia qcd does not provide a realistic model of the true spectrum , that can bias @xmath8 , unless @xmath4 and @xmath1 are simultaneously wrong in such a way that @xmath28 remains equal to the ( unknown ) actual ratio @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ eq : bbb - bias ] .",
    "the use of bins quite wider than the amount of smearing makes it more likely that , even if @xmath1 is not modeled right , the ratio @xmath28 in each bin will be approximately correct . in @xcite the bins",
    "are safely wider than jet @xmath0 resolution , and their edges are driven by experimental constraints , such as trigger thresholds .    to assess the uncertainty from possible wrong modeling of @xmath1 , the mc events used to determine @xmath12 were re - weighted in multiple ways .",
    "their re - weighting was determined by functions smooth in jet @xmath0 , chosen so as to bracket the variation observed by varying parton density functions , by including next - to - leading - order corrections to qcd , as well as the difference observed between @xmath5 and @xmath4 . for each set of re - weighted mc events both @xmath1 and @xmath4 were re - computed , and so was @xmath12 for each bin @xmath2 . the largest variation observed in each @xmath12 was taken as a systematic uncertainty .      by far the dominant uncertainty in the final @xmath8 comes from the uncertainty in jet energy scale ( jes ) . all previous uncertainties , added in quadrature , amount to about 5% of relative uncertainty in @xmath12 , which is the error band shown in fig .  [ fig : corrfactors ] .",
    "the rest @xmath3040% of uncertainty in the final answer comes from the jes uncertainty , and it dominates the blue error band in fig .",

    "that affects @xmath4 strongly , while @xmath1 does nt change , therefore @xmath12 varies significantly . by applying on @xmath5 the two alternative values of @xmath12 , from the positive and the negative jes shift ,",

    "more methods are being considered for future iterations of some of these analyses .",
    "unfolding has been used only in analyses where the goal was to estimate a truth - level distribution .",
    "unfolding has been deliberately avoided in searches for new physics , where bias in bins with low statistics can not be afforded , where it can not be assumed that the data are consistent with the mc prediction as is silently assumed in some stages of unfolding , and where poisson - distributed data are simpler to evaluate than estimators resulting from unfolding procedures after a series of arbitrary regularization choices .",
    "there are several unfolding methods , in some of which anomalies due to new physics could even be reduced , whereas the observed data are unique .",
    "any inference is possible using directly the data , without unfolding , and a theoretical prediction that either includes full detector simulation , or at least an approximation of it that amounts to the inverse of unfolding , namely folding , which can be done with no need for regularization .",
    "the only task for which unfolding is strictly needed is the estimation of a truth - level spectrum , whose later use to make statistical inferences becomes complicated by non - poissonian statistics , biases that are hard to estimate , and bin - to - bin correlations .    in none of the analyses where unfolding was used",
    "was the full covariance matrix provided .",
    "the latter would be necessary to correctly compare a truth - level theoretical prediction to the result of unfolding . in most cases",
    "the comparison between the result of unfolding and the truth - level standard model prediction is made qualitatively , avoiding to provide a @xmath77-value that would require proper use of the covariances between bins . when a more quantitative comparison is attempted , like in @xcite , a @xmath78 is used only as a metric to determine if one theory agrees with the data more than another , but not as a test statistic to compute a @xmath77-value .",
