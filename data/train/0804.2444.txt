    "the workshop conveners created small groups which were asked to discuss issues related to the heliosphere and the local bubble ( lb ) .",
    "the members of sessions 1 and 3 combined to discuss the physical processes within and pressure and energy balances of the lb .",
    "while these topics assume that the lb actually exists , this assumption is debatable because the traditional evidence for a hot lb ( soft x - rays that originate within a few hundred parsecs of the earth and are seen in all directions ) could possibly be due to another , recently discovered source .",
    "that source , solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) is outlined in section  [ swcx ] .",
    "the debate over the local bubble s existence is presented in section  [ debate ] . in section  [ pressure_energy ] , we summarize the discussion of the pressure and energy balances within the local bubble .",
    "the discussion of the pressure balance allows for the possibility that the lb gas pressure is smaller than previously assumed due to the swcx component , but the later discussions assume the traditional conception of the lb as containing hot gas . in section  [ smallstructure ] ,",
    "we summarize the discussion of clouds within the local bubble , and in section  [ otherprocesses ] , we discuss other important physical processes .",
    "this report follows the arguments presented at the session and later presented to the workshop participants for their comments .",
    "the solar wind is highly charged .",
    "when solar wind ions encounter neutral gas ( in the coma of comets , in planetary atmospheres , and dispersed within the heliosphere ) , they have a high probability of capturing an electron from the neutral atom .",
    "2 .   an example using solar wind element `` x '' : x@xmath0 + h or he @xmath1 x@xmath2 + h@xmath3 or he@xmath3 .",
    "3 .   since the electron is transferred into a highly excited orbital ( denoted by @xmath4 ) , the charge transfer is soon followed by de - excitation and radiation of at least one x - ray photon .",
    "the resulting x - rays are colloquially referred to as swcx x - rays .",
    "4 .   cravens ( 2000 ) and robertson & cravens ( 2003 ) proposed that @xmath5 of the observed 1/4 kev flux previously attributed to the lb is due to swcx in the heliosphere .",

    "koutroumpa et al . (",
    "2007 ) proposed that swcx can explain @xmath6 of the observed o  x - ray flux previously attributed to the lb .",
    "charge exchange and the subsequent release of x - ray photons are being studied currently with more refined reaction rates expected in the near future .",
    "the swcx intensity depends on the sun s activity level , which varies with time .",
    "below , we present the arguments for ( left column ) and against ( right column ) the existence of the local bubble :    2    * pro local bubble * + 1 . ) _ x - ray argument :   swcx explains only a fraction of the observed `` locally produced '' x - rays , the remainder must come from the local bubble : _    1 .",

    "2 .   the observed 1/4 kev x - ray flux is bright where the h  column density is dim and _ vice verse_. this anticorrelation implies that the x - ray emitting gas occupies a cavity in the h  distribution . in general , the effect is not due to absorption , which would simultaneously harden the observed spectrum ( see mccammon & sanders , 1990 ) .",

    "similarly , the local interstellar cloud ( see other articles in this volume ) would expand if it were not compressed by the local bubble s pressure .",
    "* response : invoking a large magnetic pressure in the local cavity requires an unreasonably strong magnetic field .",
    "* response : if the gas is not in pressure balance , then the local cloud would be expanding at  10 km s@xmath11 which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "stars within the local bubble region have outflows that terminate where they interact with the ism .",
    "therefore , for termination shocks to exist here , there must be material in the lb ( wood 2007 ) .    4 . ) _ local cavity and local cloud counter - argument : _    1 .",
    "there is an unexplained gap between the lb and the local cavity wall , so the milky way does contain regions with apparent imbalances in the thermal pressure .",
    "* magnetic pressure may compensate for the imbalance in thermal pressure . * total pressures need not be balanced if the system is dynamic .",
    "+ . +      1 .",
    "more x - ray spectroscopic observations are needed to test the swcx predictions .",
    "x - ray observations with much higher spectral resolution are needed to compare the spectral details of the swcx models with observed spectra .",
    "3 .   the high spectral resolution observations must have sufficient spatial resolution for shadowing experiments , in which opaque clouds are used to block the x - rays from more distant diffuse sources .",
    "such high spectral and spatial resolution observations are needed in the 1/4 kev band , which carries much of the flux of the presumably hot ( @xmath12  k ) local bubble .",
    "previously , the lb s thermal pressure had been calculated from the flux of 1/4  kev photons produced between the sun and a shadowing cloud located @xmath13  pc from the sun .",
    "the resulting thermal pressure was @xmath14  k @xmath15 ( snowden et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the lb pressure quoted above is far larger than the thermal pressure of the local warm clouds and other cool gas in the galactic disk , @xmath16  k @xmath15 ( jenkins & tripp , 2001 ) .",
    "the pressure discrepancy between the lb and local warm clouds could be alleviated somewhat if half of the soft x - ray flux previously attributed to the lb is actually due to swcx ions .",
    "since the flux is proportional to @xmath17 , the thermal pressure is proportional to the square root of the flux .",
    "if the lb flux were reduced by a factor of 2 , as suggested by cravens ( 2000 ) and robertson & cravens ( 2003 ) , the lb pressure would decrease by a factor of @xmath18 , but this is not sufficient to explain the large pressure discrepancy between the lb and the local warm cloud pressures .",
    "2 .   on the other hand , we do not need to invoke swcx x - rays in order to lower the lb thermal pressure which could be smaller than the estimated 15,000  k  @xmath15 if the gas is far from cie .",
    "for example , breitschwerdt ( 2001 ) explained the lb s soft x - ray flux as emission from a recombining plasma whose @xmath19 was only @xmath20  k @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   alternatively",
    ", a high thermal pressure in the local bubble may well be correct ; it may be needed to balance the pressure of the material above the lb ( @xmath21  k  @xmath15 , boulares & cox 1990 ) .",
    "lastly , it is possible that there is not sufficient pressure support to balance the weight of overlying disk and halo material .",
    "some observations show material moving downwards at @xmath22  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "2 .   if one concludes that the lb does not exist , then one must find some other material to fill the space within the local cavity and provide pressure to balance the warm clouds and the overlying material .",
    "suggestions for solving this problem include : 1 .   diffuse material having a high magnetic field could provide sufficient magnetic pressure to support the overlaying material .",
    "andersson & potter ( 2006 ) found that the magnetic field strength in the plane of the sky is @xmath23 g , creating a magnetic pressure of @xmath24  k  @xmath15 on sightlines terminating within about 200  pc of the sun .",
    "however , in his conference presentation , steve spangler reported a lb sight line ( toward pulsar j0437 - 4715 , located 170  pc from the sun ) , for which the interstellar magnetic field strength is @xmath25 g .",
    "the magnetic pressure along that sight line would be far too small to balance the pressure of the adjacent gas .",
    "2 .   photoionized gas with a temperature of @xmath26  k could fill the space , but such gas may be disallowed by observations .",
    "we also considered turbulent pressure and ram pressure .",
    "we abandoned turbulent pressure because it does not provide enough support ( redfield & linsky 2004 ) , but ram pressure could provide significant support ( de avillez 2007 ) .",
    "is the local bubble expanding ?",
    "probably not .",
    "if anything , the loop i bubble is expanding into the local bubble .      1",
    ".   the hot gas in the lb is cooling , but it s energy loss is not balanced by energy gain .",
    "2 .   the embedded warm clouds are also losing energy by radiation , but they may also gain energy via photoionization by the extreme ultraviolet and soft x - ray photons from the lb ( see slavin & frisch , 2002 ) .",
    "we considered the possibility that heat may be conducted into the clouds from the surrounding hot lb plasma ( see slavin 1989 ) .",
    "1 .   however , cloud interfaces may be complicated and the conditions on either side of the interface are not well known .",
    "if the cloud is surrounded by a tangled magnetic field , then the magnetic field will quench thermal conduction .",
    "some lines of sight through embedded clouds do not contain observable numbers of o  ions ( a tracer of evaporative interfaces ) , but this may be result from the suppression of thermal conduction by magnetic fields and , therefore , can not be taken as evidence against the the existence of hot gas in the local bubble .",
    "( @xmath27  k ) , parsec - scale clouds exist within the lb ( redfield & linsky 2008 ) .",
    "one explanation for the presence of such clouds within the hostile environment of the local bubble is the cox & helenius ( 2003 ) model , in which the magnetic field drags material from the lb wall into the interior of the bubble .",
    "3 .   in addition to the population of parsec - scale clouds , there may also be a population of smaller clouds .",
    "scintillation observed in qso signals implies that very small structures exist in very local ism ( linsky et al .",
    "4 .   the very small scale clouds ( diameter = 800 to 4000  au ) that exist in the general interstellar medium may also exist within the local bubble ( see snezana stanimirovic s paper in this volume ) .",
    "they could be neutral or ionized and may be fragments from the lb wall , as in the cox & helenius model or they may result from collisions of the parsec - scale clouds ( redfield 2007 ) 5 .",
    "however , evaporation should destroy clouds on myr timescales unless the clouds are well protected by the magnetic field .",
    "the standard assumption used when analyzing the x - ray data has been that the gas is in cie but this assumption should be re - examined .",
    "breitschwerdt & schmutzler ( 1994 ) and breitschwerdt ( 2001 ) computed drastically underionized models of the lb which explained the observed quantity of soft x - ray photons .",
    "the breitschwerdt & schmutzler scenario is disallowed because the ratios of the observed x - rays to o  and c  ions and intensity are higher than expected from the model ( welsh et al .",
    "2002 ; shelton 2003 ; oegerle et al . 2005 ) .",
    "4 .   in order for the breitschwerdt & schmutzler scenario to be valid , the lb s soft x - ray intensity would need to be reduced by a large factor .",
    "i would like to thank the conference conveners ( dieter breitschwerdt , priscilla frisch , vlad izmodenov , jeffrey linsky , and eberhard mbius ) for organizing an extremely productive and enjoyable conference .",
    "special thanks go to jeffrey linsky , who ably facilitated the discussions in sessions 1 and 3 , asked me to write up this session report for the conference proceedings , and improved the manuscript .",
    "it is a pleasure to credit my fellow members of sessions 1 and 3 ( miguel de avillez , dieter breitschwerdt , berkhard fuchs , ed jenkins , dimitra koutroumpa , rosine lallement , steve snowden , steve spangler , snezana stanimirovic , and barry welsh ) for providing the discussions recorded in this report . in the question and answer periods during and",
    "after the session report was orally delivered , the larger group of workshop participants refined and supplemented some of our thinking .",
