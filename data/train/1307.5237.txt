    "when a liquid or polymer melt is ( super)cooled towards the glass transition , its viscosity and relaxation time increase with many orders of magnitude over a relatively small temperature range .",
    "more generally , the dynamics of a viscous liquid depends on two variables , density @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 ( or pressure and temperature ) . understanding what exactly controls the viscous slowing down upon cooling and/or compression remains one of the main challenges related to the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "an indication that a single , underlying quantity determines the viscous slowing down of supercooled liquids was published in 1998 by tlle et al .",
    "they showed that the dynamics of _ ortho_-terphenyl , measured at different densities and temperatures , collapses on a single curve when plotted against a function of density over temperature @xmath4 .",
    "more specifically , these neutron scattering data were found to collapse for @xmath5 .",
    "later , a similar scaling was found to work for other organic glass formers , including polymers , showing that the relaxation time is a function of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "there was some debate over the functional form of @xmath6 and whether it could be uniquely determined given the limited density changes experimentally available  @xcite . in a famous review roland et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that scaling with @xmath7 with a material specific scaling exponent @xmath3 works well for a large group of organic glass formers , including polymers .",
    "we refer to this scaling as power - law density scaling . to date , many more molecular liquids have been shown to obey power - law density scaling to a good approximation , including polymers , but also ionic liquids  @xcite and liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "the recently developed isomorph theory@xcite explains and generalizes power - law density scaling .",
    "the isomorph theory predicts that liquids which obey the theory have curves ( isomorphs ) in their phase diagrams along which structure and dynamics are invariant in the appropriate units .",
    "the isomorphs are identified by @xmath4 being constant on an isomorph , where @xmath6 is a material specific function .",
    "consequently relaxation times and transport coefficients are predicted  @xcite to be functions of @xmath4 . for sufficiently small density changes",
    "@xmath6 may be approximated by a power law : @xmath8 , which is equivalent to power law density scaling . in typical experiments",
    ", it is possible to change density around 5% , but recently it has been shown in experiments that @xmath6 is not well approximated by a power law for larger density changes of up to 20%  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the theory provides an independent method of determining the scaling exponent @xmath3 for a small density range .",
    "other predictions of the theory are that certain thermodynamical quantities including the excess entropy and isochoric specific heat are invariant on the isomorph .",
    "since both excess entropy and the relaxation times are predicted to be constant on an isomorph , the isomorph theory provides an explanation for rosenfeld s excess entropy scaling  @xcite , according to which a liquid s relaxation times and transport coefficients are functions of excess entropy only .",
    "the isomorph theory has so far only been tested in detail for atomic systems  @xcite , and for some small rigid molecules  @xcite",
    ". however , many organic glass formers are large molecules or have bulky side groups , because this makes it harder for the liquid to crystallize .",
    "these larger molecules , and polymers in particular , inherently have intra molecular degrees of freedom that influence the liquid structure and dynamics . here",
    ", we aim to bridge the gap between the simple models already shown to obey they isomorph theory , and larger flexible glass formers shown experimentally to obey power law density scaling .    since",
    "both alkanes  @xcite and polymers  @xcite have been shown to obey power - law density scaling , we simulated a general viscous model liquid of linear , flexible lennard - jones chains ( ljc ) .",
    "the model has been used extensively for viscous polymer melts close to the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "we show that the ljc liquid has isomorphs in its phase diagram , and we study the effect of the intra molecular degrees of freedom on the applicability of the isomorph theory .    in section  [ sec : theory ]",
    "we give a short overview over the relevant aspects of the isomorph theory .",
    "we explain the ljc model in section  [ sec : model ] and present the details of our simulation method .",
    "we start our discussion of the results by showing how the isomorphs were obtained for the ljc model ( section  [ ssec : making_isomorphs ] ) .",
    "we then verify that the dynamics ( section  [ ssec : dynamics ] ) and some aspects of the structure ( section  [ ssec : structure ] ) are invariant on the isomorph . as predicted by the isomorph theory ,",
    "we show in section  [ ssec : scaling ] that isomorph scaling can be used to collapse the dynamics along different isochores onto a single master curve .",
    "an isomorph is a curve in the phase diagram that consists of state points that are isomorphic to each other .",
    "if one takes two state points with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then pairs of microconfigurations exist with the same coordinates when scaled with density @xmath11 here @xmath12 denotes the coordinates of all particles .",
    "two state points are now defined to be isomorphic if these pairs of microconfigurations have proportional boltzmann weights  @xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath14 being a proportionality constant that is the same for all physically relevant pairs of microconfigurations , depending only on the two state points .",
    "thus , if two state points are isomorphic , they have the same probability distributions of their reduced unit configurations . from this definition it can be shown that various dynamical and structural properties are invariant on an isomorph , as well as the excess entropy  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our model system is expected to only obey the isomorph definition approximately , since the rigid bonds in the molecule do not scale with density .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium configurations at different densities in general are not the same .",
    "the development of the isomorph theory was preceded by the discovery that some liquids have strong correlations in the equilibrium fluctuations of the configurational parts of their energy and pressure .",
    "the correlations can be quantified by the standard correlation coefficient  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the potential energy , @xmath17 is the virial , @xmath18 denotes deviation from thermal average , and brackets @xmath19 denote average in the canonical ensemble . for liquids where the pair potential is an inverse power law ( ipl ) , @xmath20 , the correlation is perfect ( @xmath21 ) , but a large group of liquids have a correlation coefficient close to one , indicating strong correlation . liquids with a correlation coefficient larger than 0.9 were referred to as `` strongly correlating '' , but since this term was often confused with strongly correlated quantum systems , we now refer to this class of liquids as `` roskilde - simple '' liquids .",
    "the standard linear regression slope @xmath22 of the fluctuations is given by @xmath23 it can be shown using the standard fluctuation formulae that this slope is equal to the logarithmic density derivative of the temperature on a curve of constant excess entropy @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the entropy of an ideal gas at the same temperature and density  @xcite @xmath26 this slope @xmath22 is equal to the density scaling exponent @xmath27 mentioned in the introduction , as long the change of density is small enough .    one can use the `` slope '' @xmath22 calculated from the fluctuations to trace out a curve of constant excess entropy in the phase diagram .",
    "first , one calculates @xmath22 at a certain state point ( 1 ) with temperature @xmath28 and density @xmath29 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) . if one then increments density by a sufficiently small amount to density @xmath30 , it is possible to calculate the temperature @xmath31 ( eq .  ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) ) that has the same excess entropy at this new density .",
    "this can be done many times in an iterative fashion to obtain a set of state points that have the same excess entropy .",
    "since @xmath22 may change with density , it is necessary to increment density by a sufficiently small amount ( e.g. , 2% ) , which can be checked by comparing the effect of a different density increment .",
    "here we use this method to trace out curves in the phase diagram with invariant excess entropy and check if the predicted isomorphic invariance of other properties is fulfilled .",
    "it should be noted that the invariance is only predicted to hold when quantities are considered in the appropriate reduced units , e.g. , using @xmath32 as the unit of length , and @xmath33 as the unit of energy  @xcite .",
    "we denote reduced units with a tilde .",
    "the isomorph theory predicts `` isomorph scaling '' , i.e. , that the dynamics is a function of @xmath4 , where @xmath6 depends on the system  @xcite . for atomic systems interacting via a pair potential that is the sum of ipl potentials @xmath34 , @xmath6 is given by @xmath35 , where the constants @xmath36 are the fractional contributions of each term to the heat capacity  @xcite .",
    "this includes for example the celebrated lennard - jones potential  @xcite . for molecular liquids @xmath6",
    "is not known analytically .",
    "we performed molecular dynamics simulations of flexible lennard - jones chains ( ljcs ) consisting of 10 rigidly bonded segments .",
    "segments in different molecules and non - bonded segments within a molecule interact via the standard lj potential , cutting and shifting the potential at @xmath37 .",
    "we simulated 200 chains in a cubic bounding box with periodic boundary conditions in the nvt ensemble using a nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "for the time step we used @xmath38 , and the time constant of the thermostat was 0.2 .",
    "the simulations were performed with our rumd  @xcite software utilizing state of the art gpu computing .",
    "the model has been derived from a model by kremer and grest  @xcite , who did not include the attractive part of the lj potential .",
    "later , the attractive part has usually been included .",
    "short lj chains of around ten segments have been used extensively to simulate glassy polymer melts  @xcite , even though real polymers easily consist of thousands of monomers .",
    "the reason for this is threefold .",
    "firstly , the ljc is a coarse - grained model , meaning that a single lennard - jones particle may correspond to several monomers .",
    "secondly , increasing the chain length in general increases the total system size , which in turn increases the simulation time .",
    "most importantly , it is often the equilibrium ( viscous ) liquid that is of interest .",
    "both increasing the chain length and approaching the glass transition increase the equilibration time , meaning that there is always a trade - off between chain length and viscosity  @xcite .",
    "often , the neighboring segments in the chain are bonded by a fene potential , although harmonic springs  @xcite and rigid bonds  @xcite have also been used . here",
    ", the bond length @xmath39 was kept constant using the time symmetrical central difference algorithm  @xcite . like other constraint algorithms ,",
    "these bonds contribute to the virial  @xcite : @xmath40 , but not to the energy .    with our purpose in mind ,",
    "the model is of special interest since it has already been shown to obey power - law density scaling , using @xmath22 as an empirical scaling parameter .",
    "moreover , the ljc liquid has been shown to obey rosenfeld s excess entropy scaling  @xcite .",
    "to generate an isomorph , a nvt simulation was performed at a state point @xmath41 , and the scaling exponent @xmath22 was calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "we then changed density with 0.02 and used equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) to find the temperature at the new state point for which the excess entropy @xmath42 is the same .",
    "applying this procedure iteratively we obtain a curve with constant @xmath42 .",
    "if the model conforms to the isomorph theory , this curve will be an isomorph , i.e. , have invariant dynamics and structure in reduced units .",
    "five prospective isomorphs were generated using this procedure with @xmath43 and @xmath44    , calculated from the instantaneous values of the virial @xmath17 and the potential energy @xmath16 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) .",
    "each data set corresponds to an isomorph , obtained as described in the text ( see fig .  [",

    ", the correlation coefficient varies between 0.81 and 0.87 , which is lower then the ( somewhat arbitrary ) 0.9 limit for simple liquids .",

    "the isomorph theory predicts @xmath22 to depend on density but not temperature@xcite .",
    "this is seen to be fulfilled to a good approximation ; @xmath22 changes much more by increasing density by 25% than by increasing temperature by 60% .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath22 means that we can only use eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) for small density changes , which indicates that simple power - law density scaling is an approximation that only works for small density changes .",
    "the @xmath22 values found for the ljc model ( 6.17.9 ) are higher than for a single component lj liquid ( 5.36.7 )  @xcite .",
    "this increase in @xmath22 is due to the fixed constraints , which can be seen as a very steep repulsion between bonded segments . on the other hand ,",
