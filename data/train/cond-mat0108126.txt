    "activated processes are responsible for large qualitative changes in broad classes of systems .",
    "a well - known example is escape from a potential well , in which fluctuations carry the system over a potential barrier .",
    "activated escape underlies diffusion in crystals , protein folding , and provides a paradigm for activated chemical reactions .",
    "another example is nucleation in phase transitions",
    ". it would be advantageous to control the probabilities of activated processes by applying a comparatively weak external force .",
    "the idea is that the force need not be solely responsible for driving the system over the barrier ; it only must appropriately influence fluctuations .",
    "a familiar phenomenon which has elements of control of activated processes is stochastic resonance ( sr)@xcite . in sr , an adiabatic modulation of the system parameters by a slowly varying field is usually assumed .",
    "the strong effect of the field can be readily understood in this case , if one notices that the probability of a thermally activated process is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the activation energy ( the barrier height for escape from a potential well ) .",
    "even a comparatively small field - induced modulation @xmath2 of the activation energy , @xmath3 , greatly affects @xmath4 provided @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being linear in the modulation amplitude .",
    "in contrast , one might expect that a high - frequency field would just `` heat up '' the system by changing its effective temperature . the rate @xmath4 would then be incremented by a term proportional to the field intensity @xmath7 rather than the amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "this is indeed the case in the weak - field limit @xcite . however",
    ", one may ask what happens if the appropriately weighted field amplitude is not small compared to the fluctuation intensity ( temperature ) .",
    "recent results @xcite show that , counter - intuitively , for high - frequency driving the change of @xmath6 is linear in @xmath9 , over a broad range of @xmath9 .",
    "the exponential effect of nonadiabatic driving leads to a number of new phenomena not encountered in sr , including resonant ( in the field frequency ) rate enhancement .",
    "this provides the basis for much of the selectivity and flexibility in controlling fluctuations , as we now outline .",
    "one can effectively control activated processes because , although they happen at random , the trajectories of the system in an activated process are close to a specific trajectory . the latter is called the optimal path for the corresponding process @xcite . the effect of the driving field accumulates along the optimal path , giving rise to a linear - in - the - field correction to the activation energy @xmath1 .",
    "it can be calculated if the fluctuational dynamics of the system is known .",
    "alternatively , response to the driving can be found experimentally , and in fact used to investigate the system dynamics away from the metastable state .    a fairly general case in which the field effect can be evaluated and insight gained into the underlying mechanism is a dynamical system driven by a stationary colored gaussian noise @xmath10 with a power spectrum @xmath11 of arbitrary shape @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation of motion is of the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the period of the driving force @xmath14 .    for small characteristic noise intensity @xmath15 ,",
    "the system mainly performs small fluctuations about its periodic metastable state @xmath16 .",
    "large fluctuations , like those leading to escape from the basin of attraction to @xmath17 , require large bursts of @xmath10 which would overcome the restoring force @xmath18 .",
    "the probability densities of large bursts of @xmath10 are exponentially small , @xmath19 $ ] , and exponentially different depending on the form of @xmath10 [ @xmath20 is given by the fourier transform of @xmath21 .",
    "therefore for any state @xmath22 into which the system is brought by the noise at time @xmath23 , there exists a realization @xmath24 which is exponentially more probable than the others . this optimal realization and the corresponding optimal path of the system",

    "we now turn to the case where the driving force @xmath14 is comparatively weak , so that the field - induced correction @xmath34 . nonetheless , @xmath35 may exceed @xmath36 and thus strongly change the rate @xmath4 ( [ escape_rate ] ) . to first order",
    ", @xmath2 can be obtained by evaluating the term @xmath37 in ( [ varfunct ] ) along the path @xmath38 , @xmath39 calculated for @xmath40 .",
    "special care has to be taken when activated escape and nucleation are analyzed .",
    "here in the absence of driving , the optimal path is an instanton , the optimal fluctuation may occur at any time @xmath41 .",
    "the field @xmath14 lifts the time degeneracy of escape paths .",
    "it synchronizes optimal escape trajectories , selecting one per period , so as to minimize the activation energy of escape @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the correction @xmath2 should be evaluated along the appropriate trajectory , @xmath42    eq .",
    "( [ escape_chi ] ) provides a closed - form expression for the change of the time - averaged activation rate @xmath43 , for an arbitrary spectrum of the driving field @xmath14 .",
    "clearly @xmath44 is linear in @xmath45 , and the corresponding coefficient @xmath46 is therefore called the logarithmic susceptibility ( ls ) @xcite . because of minimization over @xmath41 , the change of @xmath44 is nonanalytic in @xmath14 , which leads to a number of observable consequences .",
    "the ls has been evaluated for overdamped and underdamped white - noise driven systems@xcite .",
    "extensive numerical and analog simulations of the escape rate in driven systems @xcite are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the theory , including the prefactor , over a broad range of field amplitudes .",
    "a simple physical system which embodies a number of activated phenomena is a mesoscopic dielectric brownian particle trapped by a strongly focused laser beam creating an optical gradient trap , i.e. `` optical tweezers '' @xcite .",
    "techniques based on optical tweezers have found broad applications in contactless manipulation of objects such as atoms , colloidal particles , and biological materials . activated",
    "escape can be studied using a dual optical trap generated by two closely spaced parallel light beams .",
    "this was used initially to investigate the synchronization of interwell transitions by low - frequency ( adiabatic ) sinusoidal forcing @xcite",
    ".    quantitative characterization of activated processes requires that the double - well confining potential of a dual trap @xmath47 be adequately determined .",
    "the corresponding measurement , for a transparent spherical silica particle of diameter @xmath48 m optically trapped in water , was reported recently @xcite .    in the experiment @xcite ,",
    "all three coordinates of the particle are determined simultaneously .",
    "the double - well potential @xmath47 is found directly from the measured stationary distribution @xmath49 $ ] . from the kramers theory @xcite ,",
    "it is possible then to calculate the rates @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) of activated transitions between the minima of @xmath47 . for the range of @xmath47 in which @xmath50 vary by nearly 3 orders of magnitude , the calculated values of @xmath50 are in excellent quantitative agreement with the results of direct measurements",
    "this provides a direct model - free test of the multidimensional kramers rate theory , with no adjustable parameters .",
    "the double - beam trap can also be used to investigate the effect of ac - modulation on transition rates .",
    "an interesting application of this effect is to direct the diffusion of a particle in a spatially periodic potential @xcite . for a generic periodic potential ,",
    "the ac - induced change of the activation barrier differs depending on the direction in which the particle moves ( right or left , for example ) .",
    "this makes the probabilities of transitions to the right and to the left exponentially different and results in diffusion in the direction of more frequent transitions .",
    "an effect closely related to directed diffusion , but more amenable to testing using optical trapping , is ac - field induced localization in one of the wells of a symmetric double - well potential .",
    "both effects should occur if the field breaks the spatio - temporal symmetry of the system .",

    "when the phase angle is incremented by @xmath59 , the escape rates from the left and right wells interchange .",

    "the modulation amplitude is @xmath62 .",
    "the frequency @xmath63 varies between 1 and 100 hz , which covers the range from adiabatically slow to nonadiabatic modulation . over this range",

    "it is the breaking of the spatio - temporal symmetry @xmath65 that leads to the escape rate from one of the wells being on average much bigger than from the other , as seen from fig .  1 .",
    "in turn , this leads to a higher population in one of the wells .",
    "not only is it observed under slow modulation , as evidenced by fig .  1 , but a population difference of @xmath66 is also observed far into the nonadiabatic regime .",
    "this is sufficient to create significant directional diffusion , and demonstrates the onset of _ dynamical _ symmetry breaking .",
    "the effect would not arise if nonadiabatic driving led just to `` heating '' of the particle .",
    "investigation of methods to control activated processes is currently at a very exciting stage .",
    "the importance of the problem and its relevance to many areas , from condensed - matter physics to biophysics , is becoming increasingly appreciated .",
    "the results outlined here show that there is a fairly general approach to controlling fluctuations , and the first experiments on overdamped systems show that such control can indeed be exercised .",
