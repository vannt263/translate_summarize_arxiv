    "high - dimensional datasets are predominantly characterized by a large ambient dimension of the covariates @xmath5 and a small number of the observations @xmath4 . an important assumption in analyzing such datasets",
    "is that the true dimension of the relevant covariates @xmath3 is often smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath6 be i.i.d .",
    "observations where @xmath7 is a @xmath5-dimensional regressor and @xmath8 is a scalar response . denote @xmath9 .",
    "consider the usual linear model @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a sparse vector , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are i.i.d .",
    "there are a number of important approaches for recovering the sparse vector @xmath14 from this model , such as lasso ( tibshirani @xcite ) , the scad ( fan and li @xcite ) , the dantzig selector ( candes and tao @xcite ) and many others . the main idea is to make use of a sparsity - encouraging penalty that gives coefficient estimation and variable selection at the same time .",
    "in particular , the popular lasso method aims to estimate @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a penalty parameter suitably chosen and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 norm of a vector .",
    "a fundamental problem in analyzing such approaches is to derive sufficient conditions such that the resulting estimates are consistent with appropriate rate of convergence .",
    "zhang and huang @xcite analyzed the sparsity and bias of this formulation .",
    "meinshausen and yu @xcite showed that with high probability , all important variables are selected by the lasso . in an important work , bickel , ritov and",
    "tsybakov @xcite proposed the restricted eigenvalue ( re ) condition .",
    "van  de geer and bhlmann @xcite considered a weaker compatibility condition to guarantee the consistency of lasso in the @xmath1 or @xmath19 sense .",
    "subsequently , many authors studied sufficient conditions under which the restricted eigenvalue condition holds .",
    "raskutti , wainwright and yu @xcite proved that the re condition holds with large probability for gaussian designs , and rudelson and zhou @xcite showed that the re condition holds for sub - gaussian distributions with large probability .    in practice , it is often necessary , sometimes even mandatory , to consider interactions of the main variables and to select the variables in a hierarchical fashion .",
    "for example , in genetic studies , the main effects of genetic and environmental factors often fail to explain enough phenotypical variation .",
    "gene - environment interactions are considered pivotal in this context . in analysis of variance models ,",
    "interactions are often analyzed only when the corresponding main effects are present . in these settings , we consider not only the main effects of @xmath20 but also the effects of their interactions @xmath21 , for any @xmath22 with @xmath23",
    ". let @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "similar to the model that only contains the main effects , we write an interaction model as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 with columns consisting of the main effects and interaction terms . in this paper , we only consider two - way interaction models .",
    "it is unclear if the main results can be extended to higher - order interaction models .",
    "it is generally desirable to select an interaction effect only after the corresponding main effects are selected . as bien , taylor and tibshirani @xcite and",
    "the references therein argued , an interaction should be allowed into the model only if the corresponding main effects are present .",
    "a version of this statement can be found in assumption ( a1 ) in section  [ sec2 ] . to achieve this goal ,",
    "several methods have been developed .",
    "yuan , joseph and zou @xcite proposed to use a two - step procedure after obtaining a first - step estimate that is consistent .",
    "the theoretical properties are studied when @xmath5 is fixed .",
    "radchenko and james @xcite used a nonconvex penalty for enforcing this strong heredity constraint . a few approaches formulated as convex optimization were also studied .",
    "zhao , rocha and yu @xcite proposed to use the cap approach and radchenko and james @xcite proposed the vanish method for hierarchical selection of variables .",
    "_ @xcite suggested a framework for structured penalty .",
    "bien , taylor and tibshirani @xcite studied a constrained optimization model for the same purpose .",
    "these three papers ( zhao , rocha and yu @xcite , choi , li and zhu @xcite , bach _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite ) consider convex optimization problems of the following type : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a convex penalty usually consisting of norms on groups of variables yuan and lin @xcite , lin and zhang @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of this penalty is given in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "a desirable property of this one - step formulation is that convex optimization techniques can be exploited to yield a global optimal solution . among these convex formulations , only radchenko and james",
    "@xcite studied theoretical properties of their estimate in terms of model selection consistency when the design matrix satisfies strong conditions , similar to the irrepresentable conditions in zhao and yu @xcite .",
    "it is thus of great interest to explore other theoretical aspects of a selected interaction model .",
    "although the convex optimization methods are attractive conceptually , the consistency of the estimates for large @xmath5 in terms of the convergence rate is largely unknown , especially under weaker conditions than those in radchenko and james @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to consider this important issue for a class of penalties .",
    "our results give a general method for proving consistency when interactions are present .",
    "in particular , two major contributions are made in this paper .",
    "first , assuming sub - gaussian distributions on the error and the variables in the main effects , we establish the consistency of penalized estimators in interaction models proposed by zhao , rocha and yu @xcite , radchenko and james @xcite , bach _",
    "_ @xcite and bien , taylor and tibshirani @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that under appropriate conditions and a modified restricted eigenvalue ( re ) condition bickel , ritov and tsybakov @xcite , these penalized estimates achieve the rate of convergence in the order @xmath0 , which matches the optimal rate of the lasso when no interaction is considered .",
    "these results also motivate us to develop a unified analysis of a general class of methods for penalized variable selection in interaction models .",
    "the main results are nonasymptotic and presented in theorem  [ th3 ] .",
    "we note that negahban _",
    "_ @xcite put forward a unified theory for high - dimensional @xmath35-estimation when the penalty satisfies a notion of decomposability . however , as will become clear later , the penalties we investigate in this paper are not necessarily decomposable , and thus the theory developed in negahban _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite is not directly applicable to the interaction models under consideration .",
    "second , we generalize the re condition to the case where both the main and the interaction terms are presented in covariate @xmath36 .",
    "we remark that the presence of the interactions poses significant theoretical difficulties .",
    "for example , when the main effect covariates follow a multivariate gaussian distribution , the joint distribution of the main effects and the interactions are no longer gaussian , or even sub - gaussian .",
    "thus , the regularity conditions of some existing results are violated , for example , in raskutti , wainwright and yu @xcite and rudelson and zhou @xcite .",
    "a  new analysis in theorem  [ rennorm ] is provided to address this issue .",
    "this result can be of independent interest .",
    "there is a large literature more recently devoted to selecting variables in interaction models .",
    "one particular class is based on identifying a superset of the variables that includes the true model as a subset .",
    "hao and zhang @xcite utilized an interesting algorithm to build a hierarchical model using the forward selection ( wang @xcite ) .",
    "another class is to exploit algorithms for interaction selection .",
    "shah @xcite exploited a backtracking iterative algorithm to identify a true model .",
    "hall and xue @xcite adopted a simple recursive approach to allow identifications .",
    "bickel , ritov and tsybakov @xcite studied a procedure with a sequential lasso fit .",
    "the main content of this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we establish the consistency of the estimators with penalty functions defined in zhao , rocha and yu @xcite , radchenko and james @xcite , and bien , taylor and tibshirani @xcite .",
    "we show that our result is applicable to a wider class of penalties appropriately defined . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we generalize the re condition to the interaction model setting .",
    "we develop sufficient conditions to guarantee the re condition to hold .",
    "the proofs are delayed to appendix  [ appa ] and some auxiliary results are presented in appendices  [ appb ]  and  [ appc ] .",
    "recall that @xmath29 is the number of the variables in an interaction model with @xmath5 main effect covariates . consider the model @xmath30 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is an @xmath4 by @xmath2 matrix .",
    "the columns of @xmath39 consist of the main effects and the second - order interactions as @xmath40 , and @xmath36 is independent of @xmath13 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "otherwise , we can replace @xmath44 and @xmath21 by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be the corresponding largest and smallest eigenvalues , respectively .",
    "similarly , we denote @xmath49 and define @xmath50 .",

    "let @xmath61 be the cardinality of @xmath59 . to simplify the description",
    ", we also denote @xmath62 and use a single index @xmath63 to denote either a main effect or an interaction .",
    "we focus on the strong hierarchy principle yuan , joseph and zou @xcite , choi , li and zhu @xcite as stated in the following assumption .    if @xmath64 then both @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "assumption ( a1 ) means that if an interaction is selected , that is , if @xmath67 , then the corresponding main effects should also be selected , that is , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for any @xmath70 .",
    "this assumption is very natural to achieve hierarchical selection and is a well - accepted practice in statistics .",
    "see , for example , section  1.2 of bien , taylor and tibshirani @xcite .",
    "however , this qualitative constraint also makes variable selection for interaction models extremely difficult . from a computational point of view",
    ", if one is content with selecting variables via the lasso penalty as @xmath71 , enforcing assumption ( a1 ) in this lasso formulation would give a combinatorial problem that is challenging to solve .",
    "this is why a convex relaxation of ( a1 ) such as that in zhao , rocha and yu @xcite is attractive and tractable . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "having a hierarchical structure also complicates the theoretical analysis . as will be seen later",
    ", the convex relaxations of assumption ( a1 ) in the literature eventually lead to overlapping group lasso penalties , for which the familiar techniques such as those in bickel , ritov and tsybakov @xcite and negahban",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "@xcite fail to work . finally , the main idea and analysis in this paper may also be generalized to the so - called weak hierarchy where @xmath64 leads to either @xmath72 or @xmath66 . since the majority of the works in the literature deal with strong hierarchy , we focus on this case in the following .    for hierarchical selection of variables that respects the strong heredity principle ,",
    "many authors zhao , rocha and yu @xcite , radchenko and james @xcite considered the penalized least squares problem @xmath73 where @xmath34 is a convex penalty .",

    "bien , taylor and tibshirani @xcite proposed a constrained lasso formulation for hierarchical selection , which is equivalent to using the penalty @xmath76 which is similar in nature to but different in form from ( [ rj - pen ] ) .    as will be shown later , @xmath34 is upper and lower bounded by @xmath77 for some constant @xmath78 .",
    "however , different amounts of penalty are applied on the terms in ( [ rj - pen ] ) or ( [ bien ] ) to achieve the effect of hierarchical selection .",
    "thus , the penalties in ( [ rj - pen ] ) and ( [ bien ] ) are useful for selecting variables hierarchically , while the lasso penalty @xmath79 ignores the relative importance of the main effects and interactions .",

    "decomposable regularizers encompass many useful penalties such as the @xmath1 penalty of lasso as special cases . as general",
