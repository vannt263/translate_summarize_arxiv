    "star - forming galaxies release a significant fraction of their energy output at infrared ( ir ) and submillimeter wavelengths ( @xmath19@xmath1851000 in the rest frame ) .",
    "the luminosities of starbursts , with star formation rates over 100m@xmath9yr@xmath15 , are almost exclusively carried at ir wavelengths .",
    "whereas luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) are extremely rare in the local universe , they are prevalent at higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by studying this population we can learn about the star formation history of the universe , and because the starbursting is triggered by merger events",
    ", we can also probe models of structure formation and halo dynamics through the ages .    around 1 mm wavelengths it is possible to find similar starbursts across much of the volume of the universe , because the dimming of radiation from increasing distances is countered by the steeply rising energy spectrum between 2 mm and 200@xmath4 in the rest frame .",
    "thus , an ir galaxy would produce nearly the same ( sub)millimeter flux regardless of its distance in the range of @xmath2010 .    the nearly bias - free selection , together with the fundamental desire for studying starbursts , make submillimeter surveys @xcite especially relevant .",
    "however , while finding submillimeter - selected galaxies ( smgs ) is relatively straightforward , studying them in any detail has proved difficult .",
    "this is due to two factors : they are faint at other wavelengths , and there are often multiple possible optical / nir counterparts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the poor spatial resolution of most ( sub)millimeter telescopes ( typically 1030  fwhm ) .    as a result",
    ", most spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for smgs with radio - detected counterparts providing the required positional accuracy .",
    "thus , @xcite and @xcite discovered that most smgs lie around a median redshift of 2.3 , are extraordinarily luminous ( 10@xmath2110@xmath22l@xmath23 ) and have large molecular gas reservoirs ( 10@xmath1110@xmath24m@xmath23 ) .",
    "the close correlation between ir and radio luminosities of smgs resembles that of local star - forming galaxies @xcite , implying that star - formation is the principal power source .    despite these successes however , the number of smgs with spectroscopic redshifts is only around a hundred , and less than half of these are characterized in the far - infrared ( fir ) .",
    "furthermore , the radio - undetected smg population is almost completely unexplored .",
    "a truly unbiased understanding of smgs requires improved selection methods .",
    "a major step forward in understanding smgs was provided by _",
    "spitzer_. with its sensitive mid - ir imaging and spectroscopic capabilities , _ spitzer _ detected most smgs in multiple mid - ir bands , which can provide accurate photometric redshifts @xmath25@xmath60.1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lonsdale et al .",
    "furthermore , many _",
    "spitzer_-selected objects are predicted to be submillimeter bright ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2009 ; hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the identification of mid - ir counterparts to smgs is plagued by problems similar to those of optical association @xcite , and so the reliance on radio associations remains .",
    "selecting strongly luminous starbursts at @xmath17@xmath182 from _ spitzer _ data can overcome these problems , and the resulting samples are expected to contain a large proportion of smgs within them .",
    "thus , a two - step process has been suggested .",
    "first , selecting sources with peak _ spitzer_infrared array camera ( irac ) flux densities in the 5.8channel should remove galaxies with a mid - ir luminous active galactic nucleus ( agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leaving objects with a clear rest - frame 1.6opacity minimum at @xmath17@xmath262 .",
    "the required irac detections ensure that stellar masses are large , especially when applied to limited sensitivity samples such as swire @xcite .",
    "second , a bright 24flux density cut ( @xmath27@xmath2400@xmath28jy ) favors starbursts at the same redshift as the strong rest - frame 7.7polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature is redshifted into the band .",
    "redshifts from infrared spectrograph ( irs ) spectra or from irac photometry confirm that most sources selected in this way lie at @xmath17@xmath62 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* n.  fiolet et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the effectiveness of such a two - pronged selection was confirmed by @xcite and fiolet et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter @xcite ) , who detected a significant fraction of these sources at 1.2 mm using the mambo camera at the iram 30 m telescope ( i.e. ,  @xmath29@xmath162mjy ) .",
    "clearly , the proposed _",
    "selection ( see table  [ tab : selection ] ) yields distant luminous starburst galaxies without radio preselection .",
    "l c[!bth ] irac & @xmath30 + mips 24 & @xmath31@xmath28jy + mambo & @xmath32mjy    a key question is to what extent the swire - selected samples are in fact representative of the purely submillimeter - selected population .",
    "a straightforward way to test this is to constrain where the peak of the ir emission lies , thus bridging the gap between the cold dust detected by mambo , and the hot dust and pahs detected by _",
    "spitzer_. such constraints can be used to derive effective dust temperatures and accurate ir luminosities , for comparison with the overall smg population . because the sample consists of galaxies at z@xmath182 , and dust temperatures",
    "are expected in the range of 3040k , the 350band offers an ideal opportunity for providing the constraints we seek .    for our study",
    ", we targeted 12 galaxies from @xcite and another 8 from @xcite .",
    "the former is an almost complete sample of sources from 0.5deg@xmath14 satisfying the criteria of table  [ tab : selection ] , whereas the @xcite sources are drawn arbitrarily from @xmath1830deg@xmath14 . to enhance our chances of detection at 350@xmath4",

    "we characterize the sample in section  [ sec : discussion ] , deriving precise dust temperatures , dust / gas masses and luminosities , and with them we verify the ( far-)infrared to radio correlation .",

    "we often assume that each deep - field ( sub)millimeter detection corresponds to just one luminous galaxy , with unique counterparts at optical , ir , or radio wavelength .",
    "granted that the clustering of smgs on scales @xmath4015  is not well known , it seems reasonable given the generally low density ( @xmath18400/deg@xmath14 ) of sources in the current , shallow ( sub)millimeter surveys . however",
    ", our multiplet puts this assumption to the test : the 350components that we identify around l-23 would constitute a single source under the spatial resolution ( 1530  ) of current ( sub)millimeter surveys .",
    "the fact that it is a triplet or a quadruplet suggests that unresolved doublet , or even triplet ( sub)millimeter sources may abound . the @xmath1820% fraction of the radio - identified smgs with multiple radio counterparts @xcite could be an indication of the frequency of unresolved ( sub)millimeter multiplets , which is also consistent with @xcite . as such , the ubiquitous presumption that ( sub)millimeter sources are individual galaxies may not be entirely justified .",
    "if multiple luminous galaxies are often behind the low - resolution ( sub)millimeter peaks , the implications would be wide ranging . some or all of the irac sources commonly detected close to an uncertain ( sub)millimeter position ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could each contribute comparably to the measured ( sub)millimeter flux densities .",
    "a commonality of multiplets would imply that ( sub)millimeter source counts may be steeper than what shades @xcite , aztec @xcite , or the laboca deep - field survey @xcite found ; by counting multiple faint sources as a single bright one , these surveys would slightly underestimate the abundance of faint galaxies while substantially overestimating the number of bright ones ( i.e. , ulirgs and hyper - lirgs ) .",

    "i.e. , below the smallest scales that current ( sub)millimeter surveys can resolve , would be implied .",
    "unresolved multiplets could partially explain why as many as half of the smgs in the literature have no identifiable radio counterparts : as opposed to having one detectable counterpart , there may be a number of associated faint radio sources below the detection level .",
    "the addition of the 350data to the existing measurements provides a powerful constraint on the fir seds of the swire - selected samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it allows , for the first time , an accurate characterization of the dust temperatures and luminosities of individual sources in the sample , provided that physically realistic models of emission are fitted to the observations .    before the emergence of details on the wien - side shape of seds ( e.g. , from _ spitzer _ ) , it was common practice to rely on single - temperature dust models .",

    "values for our sample , computed according to equation ( [ eq : q ] ) using the luminosities from table  [ tab : multit ] and @xmath115=9thz . also shown are the best - fit ensemble average value of 2.08@xmath70.04 ( solid line with shaded band ) , and the estimated 2@xmath38 underlying scatter of data around it ( dotted lines ) . ]",
    "the existence of the correlation is not surprising as both the synchrotron emission and the ir luminosities are driven by the short - lived population of high - mass ( @xmath28m@xmath23 ) stars .",
    "the synchrotron emission arises when relativistic electrons , which are produced by supernovae , decelerate in the magnetic fields of galaxies . at the same time",
    ", the ir heating is dominated by the luminosities of massive ob stars . with short - lived massive stars responsible for both , measures based on luminosities , not flux densities ,",
    "are expected to capture the essence of the correlation more accurately .",
    "unlike many prior studies of the correlation , we have the advantage of well - constrained , precise luminosity estimates .",
    "accordingly , we can express the logarithmic correlation constant as    @xmath116    with an appropriately chosen normalization frequency @xmath115 for the ir luminosity .",
    "the rest - frame radio luminosity density @xmath117 is calculated from the observed flux density @xmath118 using :    @xmath119    in terms of the luminosity distance @xmath67 and radio spectral index @xmath99 .",
    "the analysis of the swire / mambo sample uses @xmath99 values quoted in @xcite , while for the local starbursts we fitted @xmath99 along with the other parameters .",
    "it is practical to choose the normalization frequency @xmath115 such that the resulting @xmath114 values can be compared directly to the widely used original measure of @xcite , which assumed typical temperatures of 40k .",
    "we pick @xmath115 such that the definitions match exactly at that temperature , giving @xmath115@xmath944.52thz used with @xmath66 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or @xmath115@xmath949.0thz used with @xmath106 assuming @xmath101=7.2 . consequently , our @xmath114 values closely mimic the @xcite definition .",
    "the correlation measures @xmath114 for our single- and multi - temperature fits are listed in tables  [ tab : singlet ] and [ tab : multit ] , respectively .",
    "a different definition was suggested recently by @xcite , who normalize ir luminosities , measured in the 81000band , with @xmath115=3.75thz intended for the 40120band by @xcite .",
    "their measure no longer offers a direct comparison to many earlier studies , which is why we prefer ours .",
    "however , our @xmath114 values can be compared to @xcite after adding 0.38 ( i.e. , @xmath120 $ ] ) .",
    "we find best - fit average @xmath114 values of 2.11@xmath70.08 with the single - temperature dust models and 2.08@xmath70.04 for the power - law temperature distributions .",
    "the implied intrinsic scatters , over the measurement uncertainties , are estimated at 0.18 and 0.16 , respectively .",
    "both our mean values and intrinsic scatters ( figure  [ fig : q ] ) are significantly below those in local studies , and comparable to the smgs analyzed by @xcite , and to the @xmath121@xmath182.40 found by @xcite for their correlation measure .",
    "the result further supports the conclusion that our sample primarily consists of classical smgs , without significant excess heating either by an agn , or by low - mass stellar populations ( which are likely partially responsible for the higher average @xmath114 values observed in the local universe ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that the mid - ir selection criteria of the @xcite and @xcite , picking the bright 24sources that are also 5.8peakers , is effective in identifying a significant fraction of the smgs around @xmath17@xmath62 , thus providing a means of enhancing our understanding of the elusive smg population through studies at mid - ir and shorter wavelengths .",
    "the fir characteristics ( dust masses , temperature , and ir luminosities ) of the swire - selected sources are essentially identical to those of the classical smgs at the same redshift .",
    "additionally , the swire - selected sample exhibits a correlation between radio and ir luminosities that is indistinguishable from that seen for smgs .",
    "our other conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "to provide realistic fir characterizations for the sample , we developed new models for the seds of galaxies with power - law mass distributions of temperature components .",
    "we demonstrated that such models describe local starbursts extremely well , under a tightly constrained dust emissivity index @xmath60@xmath61.5 and mass - temperature index @xmath101@xmath67.2 .",
    "the @xmath101 values are consistent with what we expect for heating dominated by star formation .",
    "we find that the most likely ir spectral continuum shapes of the distant swire - selected starbursts differ only slightly from the local examples , with best - fit @xmath101@xmath66.7@xmath70.1 .",
    "the lower @xmath101 values are consistent with star formation under the high optical depths ( @xmath91@xmath61.2 ) in our sample .",
    "3 .   relying on the stacked irs spectra of @xcite for estimating the 24continuum contribution , we place the typical diameter of starburst activity in these smgs above 1.2kpc ( with 95% confidence ) , and find a most likely value of 2kpc .",
    "the emission scales , the typical @xmath101 , and the consistently low @xmath114 values all confirm that star formation is the main power source in the galaxies of the sample .",
    "one of our targets shows a close clustering of three or four 350components , each of which contributes comparably to the observable 350flux density under the 1530  resolution of most current ( sub)millimeter surveys .",
    "a commonality of unresolved smg multiplets could bias our understanding of this population .",
    "we need further studies to explore the importance of close multiplets in current and future submillimeter surveys .",
