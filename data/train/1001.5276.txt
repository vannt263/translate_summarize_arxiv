    "nearly 100% of the stellar mass has an age of @xmath0 9 - 12 gyr , although some recent star formation , of negligible mass fraction , is also detected .",
    "the first generation has two metallicities : metal rich stars are highly concentrated at the center while metal poor stars form an annulus around it .",
    "a small fraction of the stellar mass formed an external ring and is metal enhanced . in ngc 4736 we found that most of the stars were formed at two epochs : nearly 1/3 of the light comes from old stars ( t @xmath1 10 gyr ) ( fig [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the metal rich ones ( about solar ) are highly concentrated in the nucleus while metal poor stars are scattered around it .",
    "nearly 2/3 of the light is emitted by stars formed about 2.5 gyr ago .",
    "these stars come in two metallicities : metal enriched ( 2.5 solar ) form an oval structure around the nucleus while metal poor ( 0.21 solar ) form a bar nearly aligned with the axis of rotation ( fig .",

    "our findings illustrate some of the processes of classical bulge and pseudobulge formation .",
    "although there are a variety of populations in term of ages , metallicities and structures , we do not see any structure that could somehow be associated to the liner ionization characteristic .",
