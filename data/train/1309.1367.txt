    "study of inhomogeneous and nontrivial magnetic nanostructures such as magnetic vortices and antivortices is very appealing due to their suggested applications in magnetic data storage , magnetic random access memory devices @xcite , magnetic logic devices and information processing devices @xcite . due to the presence of rotational asymmetry they are very attractive candidates for studying the interaction between the local magnetization and externally applied magnetic fields or spin polarized currents @xcite . in laterally confined ferromagnetic nanodisks ,",
    "isolated magnetic vortices can be formed , if it is energetically favorable for the magnetization to point in plane and parallel to the edges . in the centre",
    ", the magnetization is forced to point out of plane to avoid large angle between the magnetic moments since this will cost large amount of exchange energy .",
    "the region with out of plane magnetization is called vortex core and it is only a few nanometers in diameter .",
    "the direction of magnetization in the core is termed as polarization and it can have two values @xmath0 or @xmath1 depending upon weather its direction is out of plane or into the plane .",
    "similarly , the rotational sense of the in plane magnetization can be either clockwise ( cw ) or counter - clockwise ( ccw ) .",
    "magnetic vortices can be made to gyrate by the application of the magnetic fields and spin polarized currents @xcite .",
    "external magnetic fields and spin polarized currents couple to the magnetic moments of the vortex core and vortex core moves away from the equilibrium position .",
    "in addition to the external forces , the moving vortex core experiences another internal force arising from the demagnetizing field of the non - equilibrium magnetization pattern and this force acts along the perpendicular direction to the vortex core velocity and this leads towards the gyrotropic motion of the vortex core . for large amplitude excitation , the internal force increases nonlinearly and",
    "this results into a non linear vortex core gyration , vortex core switching occurs along with creation and annihilation of new vortex and antivortex @xcite . for small amplitude excitation , the internal force increases linearly and",
    "the vortex core motion remains in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "the gyrotropic vortex core motion is qualitatively described by the landau - lifshitz gilbert equation . in the linear regime ,",
    "the vortex core equation of motion can be derived from thiele s equation @xcite . during the dynamical motion of the vortex core , the demagnetization field at the vortex core point antiparallel to the enlarged domain generated due to the displaced vortex and the time derivative of magnetization vector at the vortex core point into the disk centre or into the opposite direction .",
    "a variation in chirality inherently changes the direction of the demagnetization field and therefore does not affect the vortex core motion .",
    "therefore , the vortex core gyration direction is solely controlled by the core polarization . since the vortex core motion is governed by the demagnetization field",
    ", the demagnetization energy determines the vortex core potential . in the linear regime ,",
    "parabolic potential can be assumed and vortex core can de described in a harmonic oscillator model @xcite . therefore magnetostatically",
    "coupled vortex gyration in the linear regime can be considered as the coupled forced oscillator .",
    "therefore , one expects mutual energy transfer between the gyrating vortices in the linear regime and a constant phase relation between the gyrating vortices @xcite .",
    "the mutual transfer of energy between magnetostatically coupled vortices due to the gyrotropic motion is extremely important for devices for microwave communication @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the parameters like the information signal transport rate and energy loss are the key factors in determining the device performance . vortex gyration transfer rate and energy attenuation coefficients have been calculated by analytical methods @xcite and micromagnetic numerical calculations @xcite",
    ". stimulated vortex gyration based energy transfer between spatially separated dipolar coupled magnetic disks has been observed by time resolved soft x - ray microscopy @xcite .",
    "the rate of energy transfer is determined by the frequency splitting caused by the dipolar interaction between the vortices .",
    "however , the energy transfer efficiency may dependent on several factors such as the frequency of the exciting field pulse as compared to the resonance frequency of the vortex , which is determined by the dimension and aspect ratio of the structure , the amplitude and nature of the exciting pulse , the distance between the two vortices and relative polarization of the two vortices . for the microwave communication devices , one needs to transfer the signal between physically separated but magnetostatically coupled vortices , while only one vortex has been excited for gyration .",
    "this can be obtained by application of local magnetic field .",
    "however , it has been previously observed that the propagated signal amplitude in the second vortex , is smaller in amplitude if one excites the first vortex in its resonant frequency @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the interaction strength between coupled vortices is maximum when the core polarizations of the vortices are opposite @xcite .",
    "higher interaction strength is not the sufficient condition for the higher signal transfer rate .",
    "however , to increase the efficiency of the microwave communication devices based on magnetostatically coupled vortices one needs to increase the amplitude of the response and constantly maintain the amplitude . for higher amplitude input , the vortex motion enters into nonlinear regime , vortex core switching occurs via the creation and annihilation new vortices and antivortices .",
    "therefore , in this case it is not possible to increase and maintain a larger amplitude output and a constant phase relation between gyrotropic motion of the both vortices . on the other hand ,",
    "if the applied signal is of very small amplitude and the frequency is that of the resonance frequency of the vortex , the amplitude of the response gradually increases indicating that the core switching may occur at some point , which is not desirable for the microwave communication devices .",
    "one alternative is to use a very small amplitude signal with slight deviation ( within 5% of the resonance frequency ) from the resonance frequency ( intrinsic ) of the vortex . in this letter , we have attempted to obtain a highly efficient signal transfer mechanism , including gyration signal amplification in some cases , by using a non resonant excitation with very small amplitude signal between two magnetostatically coupled vortices with different core polarization .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we describe the isolated and coupled vortex structures considered here .",
    "we also describe the simulation and analysis procedure including a numerical ansatz to achieve a magnetic ground state with desired polarity and chirality @xcite in a given vortex .",
    "a magnetic vortex is formed due to competition between exchange and demagnetizing fields .",
    "the use of permalloy ( py : ni@xmath2fe@xmath3 ) , which has no magneto - crystalline anisotropy , in a @xmath4 nm thin disk of diameter @xmath5 nm , which has little shape anisotropy , is expected to support a relatively stable vortex structure . the darker shade in fig .

    "could be observed , a magnetic ground state needs to be achieved with required vortex core polarity ( up or down ) an chirality ( clockwise : cw or counter - clockwise : ccw ) . during our simulations ,",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( b ) and ( d ) where the existence of higher order modes is confirmed .    henceforth , we only use signals rotating cw or ccw at frequencies @xmath40 and close to @xmath40 .",
    "we first use a relatively high signal amplitude of @xmath48 mt on vortex with ` up ' polarity and ccw chirality ( see the inset in fig.[fig : comp1 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp1 ] ( a ) shows the resulting time evolution of @xmath33 for cw and ccw signals rotating at frequency @xmath40 .",
    "a larger response is achieved in the case of ccw signal .",
    "as the gyrating core reaches a certain maximum speed , a polarity switching occurs . in our case , this event occurs at time @xmath49 ns .",
    "this phenomena has been described as potentially useful for data storage in terms of up or down vortex polarity @xcite .",
    "we find that , if this event is somehow avoided , one can also use this asymmetry in the response for logic operations by attributing the lower and higher resultant gyrations to the binary logical states . towards that end",
    ", we first decided to reduce the signal amplitude to @xmath48 mt .",
    "although , core switching was not observed up till @xmath50 ns , the convergence happened too slowly ( @xmath51 ns ) .",
    "as this can be undesirable for logic operations , we next reduced the excitation signal s frequency by @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp1 ] ( b ) shows the time evolution of @xmath33 for signals with amplitude @xmath48 mt and frequencies @xmath40 and @xmath53 . in spite of having a lower amplitude in response",
    ", a faster convergence is observed in the later case .",
    "such decrease if amplitude may be undesirable when the logic operation depends upon the capability of distinguishing between higher and lower gyration amplitudes . figures  [ fig : comp1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) show the spectral densities for signals rotating both cw and ccw and frequencies @xmath40 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the maxima for cw signals were found to be relatively much less sensitive to the excitation frequency than those for ccw signals .",
    "going from @xmath40 to @xmath53 , the maxima for cw signal drops by 0.774 db ( from @xmath54 db to @xmath55 db ) while that for ccw signal drops by 35.625 db ( from @xmath56 db to @xmath57 db ) . like their maxima",
    ", the convergence time - scales for cw signals were also found to be largely independent of signal frequency .",
    "hence while considering the trade - off between convergence times and relative signal amplitude one only needs to study the case of ccw signals in order to make a reliable design decision .",
    "we can also see in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp1 ] ( d ) that unlike the spectral density of the driven harmonic oscillator , that of the vortex core gyration begins to feature mode - splitting .",

    "the two peaks seen here are close to @xmath40 and @xmath53 as best allowed by numerical resolution and spectral leakage .",
    "this leads to a beat frequency of about @xmath58 in the output signal .",
    "this is yet another concern , as beats tend to change the output signal s amplitude with time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp1 ] ( e ) , we can see that the signal rotating cw at @xmath59 produces no beats while that rotating ccw produces beats at a reduced frequency .",

    "@xmath33 is computed for both the vortices separately .",
    "this serves as a indicator of their respective gyrations .",
    "the dynamics was examined with all sixteen combinations of polarity and chirality of the two vortices .",
    "when a small external bias field is applied , the vortex cores may move up or down along the @xmath70axis .",
    "this changes their separation and causes magnetic surface charges to appear on the vortex boundaries ; consequently affecting the strength of their magnetostatic coupling @xcite .",
    "hence , in the presence of a bias field , if both the vortices have the same chirality , their coupling will remain relatively unaffected , than when they have different chiralities .",
    "this mechanism can used to affect a chirality dependent dynamics and signal transmission . however , in the absence of an external bias , it was quickly understood from the simulated results that chirality does not play any role towards enhancing the asymmetry in dynamics which has been described below .",
    "furthermore , observable changes only appeared to occur between cases with similar and opposite polarities .",
    "mediated by several factors,@xcite the resonant frequencies of a pair of vortices can differ from that of an isolated vortex .",
    "however , in this study , we used an excitation signal rotating at frequency @xmath40 which is applied only on left disk ( of vortex pair seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex ] ( b ) ) . as shown in their insets , figs .",

    "these spectral densities were calculated after running the dynamics for over @xmath4 ns , so that any transient vortex core dynamics are suppressed and steady state dynamic solutions appear to be more prominent in the spectrum .    with increase in the signal amplitude from @xmath48 mt to @xmath69 mt , we see a splitting@xcite of the peak .",
    "further , when @xmath72 , more power is transmitted and stored in the gyrotropic mode of the vortex which is not being excited directly .",
    "these observations testify to the existence of anharmonic and asymmetric dynamics present in the vortex core gyration which can not be explained by solutions of the thiele s equation with linear approximations;@xcite even if vortex core deformation@xcite and development of dynamic surface charges@xcite are taken into account .",
    "this should prompt the community to develop more complex analytical models to better predict such phenomena without the need to do complete simulations .    for signal amplitude of @xmath48 mt and @xmath71 , the left vortex (",
    "which is being excited directly ) , exhibits @xmath73 db power in its gyrotropic mode while the right vortex exhibits @xmath74 db .",
    "while for @xmath72 , these values become @xmath75 db and @xmath76 db , respectively . thus , about @xmath77 db of more power is stored in the gyrotropic mode of the right vortex in the later case ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "when signal amplitude is increased to @xmath69 mt , these values become @xmath78 db ( left vortex ) and @xmath79 db ( right vortex ) for @xmath71 and @xmath80 db ( left vortex ) and @xmath81 db ( right vortex ) for @xmath72 . here , about @xmath82 db more power is stored in the gyrotropic mode of the right vortex for @xmath72 . when @xmath71 , the power distribution amongst the two vortices is relatively uniform . however , when @xmath72 , more power is absorbed in the vortex which is not being excited externally .",
    "also , the discrepancy in power distribution increases with signal amplitude .",
    "this shows that the asymmetry based on polarity ( regarding where the input power is stored ) is enhanced further by signal amplitude .",
    "thus , a logical amplifier can be conceived where input is in the form of external magnetic field and output is read as @xmath33 ( e.g. , as a kerr rotation signal ) .      in order to examine the flow of energy stored in the gyrotropic modes of vortices",
    "further , we now add another vortex towards the right of the vortex pair shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex ] ( b ) to form a three vortex sequence with polarities ( from left to right ) @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which take values of @xmath0 or @xmath1 depending up or down polarity .",
    "we concluded in the previous sub - section that relative polarity is chiefly responsible for the asymmetry in the energy transfer .",

    "is realized to explain this useful asymmetry . * in the absence of such a model @xcite , we did further simulations with a sequence of three vortices to confirm our findings .",
    "we noticed that most efficient power transfer through a vortex is possible in general when neighbouring vortices had opposite polarity . the apparently anomalous gain in for ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85)@xmath100(@xmath95 , @xmath1 , @xmath1 )",

    "some of these arrangements can also be used for two input logic gate operators @xcite . * a dependence on polarities of both nearest and next - nearest vortices was very evident in the study of different cases of the three vortex sequence .",
    "this indicated further presence of non - linear interaction in the dynamics which can be used to affect the efficiency of signal transfer by changing the inter - vortex separation .",

    "<S> we present a numerical exploration of the possibility of sustained amplification of magnetic vortex gyration by controlling the relative polarities of a coupled vortices in short vortex chains . </S>",
    "<S> first , we numerically establish the asymmetry in gyration of a single vortex based on its polarity by use of external magnetic field rotating at the gyrotropic frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomena can be used to design logical adapters if vortex core switching is avoided . </S>",
    "<S> the criteria to obtain a good gyration amplitude ratio to easily observe true or false output has been examined further . </S>",
    "<S> the cases of coupled magnetic vortices and short vortex chains have been studied with different polarity configurations to reveal other desirable aspects of vortex dynamics including , but not limited to , highly efficient signal transfer . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are important in applications for information signal processing . </S>"
