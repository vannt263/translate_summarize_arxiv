    "relativistic ejections ( jets ) are a common consequence of accretion processes onto black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as well as onto stellar mass black holes in x - ray binaries ( xrbs , see fender 2010 for a review ) . in the low / hard state ( lhs ) and probably in the quiescent state of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) a compact",
    ", steady jet is present ( fender 2001 ; gallo et al .",
    "the characteristic signature of compact - steady jets ( blandford & knigl 1979 ) is a flat / slightly inverted spectrum ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) observed in the radio band and sometimes extending to infrared ( ir ) and possibly optical frequencies ( e.g. hynes et al .",
    "2000 ; brocksopp et al .",
    "the jet power dominates over the accretion - powered luminosity in the lhs at @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the x - ray and the eddington luminosities , respectively ; fender , gallo & jonker 2003 , migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "there is strong evidence that the jet is highly quenched in the high / soft state ( hss ) of bhcs ( tananbaum et al .",
    "1972 ; fender et al . 1999 ) .",
    "krding , jester & fender ( 2006 ) showed that a generalization of the accretion states used to describe bhcs could also be applied to agn .",
    "this suggests that despite the different masses involved , systems that contain a black hole display similar accretion states and jet properties .",

    "( 1998 ) and corbel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the radio flux of the bhc gx 339 - 4 in the lhs correlates over several orders of magnitude with the x - ray flux .",
    "gallo , fender & pooley ( 2003 ) included other sources in the sample and proposed that a correlation of the form @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the radio luminosity ) with @xmath9 ( gallo et al .",
    "2006 ) could be universal and also valid for sources in quiescence .",
    "this indicated that the mechanisms responsible for the ejection of the outflows are closely coupled to the properties of the accretion flow .",
    "russell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) verified that an empirical correlation between the x - ray luminosity and the optical / ir luminosities also holds ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical / ir luminosity ) for bhcs in the lhs and in quiescence .",
    "there is evidence that in most cases the near - ir emission is jet - dominated while the optical emission is not dominated by the jet but by the reprocessing of the x - rays in the outer regions of the accretion disc ( russell et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "c    merloni , heinz & di matteo ( 2003 ) and falcke , krding & markoff ( 2004 ) have independently shown that the same x - ray / radio scaling found for bhcs also holds for supermassive black holes in agn , if the mass of the compact object is taken into account .",
    "this suggests that similar mechanisms couple accretion and ejection processes to / from black holes hold over @xmath12 9 orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "the existence of the radio / x - ray correlation has broad implications .",
    "for example , the small scatter around it has been used as an argument by heinz & merloni ( 2004 ) to infer that jets from bhcs and agn ( once a mass - correction factor is introduced ) are characterized by similar bulk velocities , unless they are all non relativistic .",

    "these sources seem to feature similar x - ray luminosities to other bhcs but are characterized by a radio emission that , given a certain x - ray luminosity , is fainter than expected from the radio / x - ray correlation .",
    "it is possible that a correlation with similar slope but lower normalization than the other bhcs could describe this discrepancy , at least in a few sources ( e.g. corbel et al .",
    "2004 ; gallo 2007 ; soleri et al . 2010 ) .",
    "if confirmed , this would suggest that some other parameters might be tuning the accretion - ejection coupling , allowing accretion flows with similar radiative efficiency to produce a broad range of outflows .",
    "garcia et al . ( 2003 ) investigated the dependence of the jet power on the orbital period of the binary .",

    "although these radio jets are most likely blobs launched during major ejection events ( and not compact - steady jets typical of bhcs in the lhs , see fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) , this could suggest that the orbital period might play a role in powering jets from bhcs .",
    "c    peer & casella ( 2009 ) presented a model for the emission from jets in xrbs in which the electrons are accelerated only once at the base of the jet ( at variance with other models , in which multiple accelerations occur ; see e.g. maitra et al .",

    "they inferred the jet power from the normalizations of the radio / x - ray and near - ir / x - ray correlations found by gallo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and russell et al .",
    "they concluded that , if our measures of the spin and the estimates of the jet power are correct , the spin does not play any role in powering jets from bhcs . in agn , on the other hand , the most powerful jets have been associated with high - spin black holes ( sikora , stawarz & lasota 2007 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether there is any connection between the values of some fixed binary parameters and properties of the outburst of bhcs and the compact steady - jet power .",
    "we discuss how doppler de - boosting effects could qualitatively explain the scatter around the radio / x - ray correlation , when a particular dependence of the bulk lorentz factor of the jet on the accretion - powered luminosity is taken into account .",
    "we also compare the `` radio quiet '' bhcs to the neutron star ( ns ) xrbs , since these systems are usually fainter in radio ( given a certain x - ray luminosity ) than bhcs ( see e.g. migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "in this paper we will follow the approach presented in fender et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to use the normalizations of the radio / x - ray and oir / x - ray correlations as a proxy for the jet power .",

    "our results are reported in table [ tab : ks ] .",
    "the k - s test shows that the probability that the `` radio quiet '' bhcs and the nss are statistically indistinguishable ( i.e. the probability of the null hypothesis ) is different from 0 , despite being small ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "if we do not apply a mass correction , the probability of the null hypothesis is consistent with 0 : the two groups constitute two different populations .",
    "the two - dimensional k - s test gives similar results considering only the atoll sources ( including the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ) , instead of all the nss , both applying or not a mass correction factor .",
    "in this paper we tested whether there is a connection between the values of some characteristic binary parameters of bhcs , as well as the properties of their outbursts , and the energy output in the form of a jet .",
    "our discussion is based on the assumption that the jet power can be traced by the radio and near - ir normalizations of the radio / x - ray and oir / x - ray correlations ( fender et al .",

    "figure [ fig : powervsorbital_param ] and the spearman correlation coefficients in table [ tab : log_spearman ] show that there is no connection between two ( non independent ) parameters of the binary system ( the size of the roche lobe of the black hole and the orbital period ) and the radio and near - ir normalizations .",
    "this result is not unexpected : theoretical works predict that a powerful jet should be formed when a thick accretion flow is present ( as it is thought the case in the lhs ; livio et al .",
    "1999 ; meier 2001 ) .",
    "considering that the thick accretion flow does not extend to the outer regions of the accretion disc ( although the details of its geometry are unknown , see gilfanov 2009 and references therein ) , it seems unlikely that the jet power is affected by the size of the roche lobe and the orbital period .",

    "recently , negoro et al . (",
    "2010 ) discovered a new bhc , maxi j1659 - 152 .",
    "this source might be the bhc with the shortest orbital period ( 2 hours and 25 minutes , see belloni et al .",
    "2010a and kuulkers et al . 2010 ) . however , this system had a normal outburst , with a transition to the soft states ( see belloni et al .",
    "2010b and shaposhnikov & yamaoka 2010 ) .",
    "this suggests that a bigger sample of bhcs characterized by a short orbital period will certainly help to clarify this issue .",
    "c    from binary evolution calculations , bhcs can in principle have orbital periods as short as @xmath192 hours and evolutionary models actually predict that short - period systems might form the majority of them , similarly to what is observed in cataclysmic variables ( yungelson et al .",
    "the fact that 16 bhcs in table [ tab : log_sources ] have an orbital period @xmath116 hr is quite puzzling .",
    "a possible explanation is that in short - period systems , the mass transfer from the companion star might be interrupted by resonances within the primary s roche lobe , if the mass ratio is @xmath117 ( yungelson et al .",
    "zurita et al ( 2008 ) suggested that the mass ratio in swift  j1753.5 - 0127 is @xmath118 and could be as high as approximately @xmath119 , thus making swift j1753.5 - 0.127 the first bhc detected nearly in this regime .",
    "however , even if the mass transfer in swift j1753.5 - 0127 is partially interrupted ( because of the high mass ratio ) , this does not explain why the source is less luminous than expected in the radio band ( in other words why its radio and near - ir normalizations are low compared to the majority of the bhcs in our sample ) , although its x - ray luminosity is comparable to other bhcs ( soleri et al .",
    "the behaviour of xte  j1118 + 480 is different : although it is the known bhc with the second shortest orbital period ( @xmath120 hr ) and its mass ratio is rather high compared the other sources in the sample ( @xmath121 ) , its radio normalization is higher than the one estimated for 7 other bhcs with longer orbital periods .",
    "this suggests that it features jet properties that are not different from the majority of the bhcs .",
    "c    in  [ par : binary ] we investigated the connection between the inclination angles of the bhcs and the radio and near - ir normalizations .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : power_outburst ] does not show any correlation between the radio normalization and the inclination angles ( see also table [ tab : log_spearman ] ) .",
    "the near - ir normalization instead has a fairly high probability to be anticorrelated to the inclination angle .",
    "this would be consistent with a scenario in which the inner jet ( responsible for the ir emission , blandford & knigl 1979 ) has a higher lorentz factor @xmath94 ( and therefore it is more de - boosted ) than the the outer jet ( where the radio emission originates ) , i.e. a decelerating jet .",
    "if we restrict our analysis on a sample of sources for which both the mass and the distance have been measured (  [ par : binary_restricted ] ) neither the radio nor the near - ir normalizations are correlated to the inclination angle . however",
    ", this result might have been strongly biassed by the limited number of data points .",
    "the radio jet power does not appear to be correlated to the viewing angle even if the radio normalizations are calculated using the mass - corrected radio luminosities .",
    "to further investigate the decelerating jet scenario , in figure [ fig : radio_vs_jhk_normalization ] we reported the near - ir normalizations versus the radio normalizations . for a decelerating jet , we do not expect the data to be linearly correlated , especially for high - inclination sources .",
    "considering all the 7 points , we calculates a spearman rank coefficient @xmath122 , with a probability for the null hypothesis of @xmath123 .",
    "if we exclude the data point for the bhc gro j1655 - 40 and xte j1550 - 564 ( which have very high rms of the residuals in x - ray / radio and x - ray / near - ir fits , respectively ; see figure [ fig : normalizations_vs_rms ] left - hand panel ) the spearman rank correlation coefficient is @xmath124 , with a probability for the null hypothesis of @xmath125 . if we consider only high - inclination systems ( above @xmath126",
    "; in this case we exclude the bhcs 4u 1543 - 47 and gx 339 - 4 ) the spearman rank correlation coefficient is @xmath127 , with a probability for the null hypothesis of @xmath128 . despite the number of data points",
    "is extremely limited ( 7 or 5 ) , our results could support the decelerating jet scenario .",
    "more coordinated x - ray , near - ir and radio observations are needed to enlarge the sample .    to further test if doppler de - boosting effects play a role in populating the sample of bhcs characterized by a faint jet , in  [ par : boosting ] we defined a jet - toy model .",
    "this model results in a distribution in the ( @xmath111 ) plane which broadens at higher luminosities . considering a range of viewing angles ( figure [ fig : toy_model ] ) , the model can qualitatively describe the scatter around the radio / x - ray correlation .",
    "the line for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) increases its slope at @xmath131 ( figure [ fig : toy_model ] ) , since the jet is boosted . for higher inclination angles",
    ", the model predicts that the radio / x - ray correlation , because of de - boosting effect , should become flatter at high @xmath5",
    ". this might be the case for the bhc h  1743 - 322 ( for which @xmath132 ; jonker et al .",
    "2010 ) , in agreement with the high rms of the residuals that we obtained for this source .",
    "unfortunately , the viewing angle of h  1743 - 322 system is unknown .",
    "however , the jet - toy model has strong limitations in explaining the behaviour of other systems ( e.g. xte  j1650 - 500 and swift  j1753.5 - 0127 ) .",
    "these `` radio quiet '' bhcs feature a slope of the x - ray / radio correlation steeper than @xmath67 ( even if figure [ fig : normalizations_vs_rms ] seem to suggest that fitting their data point with a slope fixed to @xmath67 is a reasonable approximation ) , and they are probably characterized by high inclination angles ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively ) .",
    "we also note that the bhc v404  cyg lies approximately on the line for @xmath129 .",
    "this does not match the measured value of @xmath135 ( table [ tab : log_sources ] ) .",
    "the same happens for other bhcs in our sample , which are actually scattered over several lines .",
    "our considerations suggest that , although the model can qualitatively describe the scatter in the ( @xmath136 ) plane , it should be only seen as a viable possibility to describe the `` radio quiet '' population . in fact , at the moment we do not know whether the `` radio quietness '' is an intrinsic property or it might change with time .",
    "in  [ par : comparison_ns ] we compared the `` radio quiet '' bhcs to the nss .",
    "a two - dimensional k - s test can not completely rule out the possibility that the two families are statistically indistinguishable in the x - ray : radio plane , if a mass correction is applied .",
    "interestingly , including or not the ns z sources ( that usually feature a disc - jet coupling more similar to bhcs than to ns atoll sources , migliari & fender 2006 ) does not substantially change the results of the k - s test . since for several outliers the mass of the compact object has not been dynamically measured ( e.g. grs 1758 - 258 and xte j1720 - 318 ) , our results seem to suggest that some of the outliers could actually be neutron stars .",
    "another possibility is that the disc - jet coupling in the `` radio quiet '' bhcs is more similar to the one in nss .",

    "( 2003 ) is not applied , `` radio quiet '' bhcs and nss clearly do not belong to the same population .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mass correction works for black holes of different masses as well as nss : this implies that the correction may not be dependent on black - hole features like for example the presence of an event horizon .",
    "we examined three characteristic parameters of bhcs and the properties of their outbursts to test whether they regulate the energy output in the form of a jet .",
    "this has been motivated by the fact that a growing population of sources seems to feature similar accretion flows to the majority of the bhcs ( e.g. similar radiative efficiency ) but fainter jets than expected .",
    "garcia et al . ( 2003 ) suggested that spatially - resolved powerful jets ( so discrete ejections and not compact - steady jets in the lhs ) might be associated with long period systems .",
    "if our estimates of the jet power are correct , both the orbital period and the size of the accretion disc are not related to the radio and near - ir jet power .",
    "we retrieved the properties of the outbursts occurred by the bhcs in our sample to see if lhs - only outbursts feature different jet properties .",
    "we did not find any association between the jet power and the fact that a bhc transits to the soft states during an outburst .",
    "we also considered the inclination angles for our sample of bhcs . a recent result shows that compact - steady jets in the lhs might have bulk lorentz factor @xmath85 .",
    "this suggests that not only jets with a high inclination can suffer de - boosting effects .",
    "however , we did not find any association between the viewing angles and the jet power inferred from radio observations . the jet power obtained from near - ir measurements",
    "decreases when the inclination angle increases .",
    "although this result might be biassed by the small number of bhcs for which we have ir data , it could favour a scenario in which the jet decelerates moving from the ir - emitting to the radio - emitting part .",
    "we defined a jet - toy model in which the bulk lorentz factor @xmath94 becomes larger than @xmath0 above @xmath142 .",
    "considering an uniform distribution of viewing angles in the @xmath143 space , the model results in a distribution in the ( @xmath111 ) plane which broadens at higher luminosities .",
    "the model can qualitatively reproduce the scatter around the radio / x - ray correlation .",
    "although this result is quite promising , we stress that the toy - model has several limitations , for instance it can not reproduce the slope of the x - ray / radio correlation for some `` radio quiet '' bhcs characterized by high inclination angles .",
    "nevertheless we think that it suggests a valid possibility that theoretical models should explore in more detail .",
    "we finally compared the `` radio quiet '' bhcs to the nss .",
    "a two - dimensional k - s test can not completely rule out the possibility that the two families are statistically indistinguishable in the x - ray : radio plane , if a mass correction from the fundamental plane of black hole activity is applied .",
