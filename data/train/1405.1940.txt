    "it is shown that the qfi always increase as the growth of coupling parameter @xmath72 , which means that we can get the a larger precision for a stronger effective coupling between rob s detector and the scalar field .",
    "we can see that the qfi of the final states depends on the observers s acceleration sensitively , which shows that the magnitude of rob s acceleration has a non - trivial influence on the quantum metrology .",

    "that is to say , we do nt need to obtain an extremely high acceleration during the estimation of the unruh effect , although the higher unruh temperature is obtained for a higher acceleration .",
    "there is a range of acceleration that provides us with the optimal precision during the estimation procedure .    to obtain a physical interpretation of this counterintuitive phenomenon",

    "we compare the qfi and the entanglement of the probe state as a function of the acceleration @xmath10 for a fixed effective coupling parameter @xmath79 .",
    "it is found that , as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the entanglement of the probe state decreases as the increasing of acceleration .",
    "on the other hand , in order to have a detectable unruh effect , the acceleration is required to be large enough .",
    "this forms a balance : it will be beneficial for the detecting of unruh effect by a increasing acceleration , but this large acceleration will destroy the entanglement which in general will induce the increasing qfi @xcite and thus obscure overall the detection . in figure 2 , we may notice that the estimation precision increases rapidly as the increase of acceleration for small value accelerations until reaching the optimal point , then decreases even the acceleration increases .",
    "for some larger acceleration , the qfi diminishes due to the decrease of quantum entanglement .",
    "this suggests the regime of acceleration @xmath10 which is beneficial for the detection of unruh effect .",
    "we are also interested in how the energy gap @xmath21 of rob s detector and the interaction time @xmath12 influence the estimation of the unruh effect . in figure 3",
    "we plot the behaviour of qfi as a function of the energy gap @xmath21 for different interaction time @xmath12 .",
    "it is shown that the qfi is sensitive to the variation of different energy gaps of rob s detector .",
    "in particular , the maximal qfi is obtained at a fixed energy gap @xmath21 value for every interaction time @xmath12 .",
    "that is to say , the energy gap of rob s detector has a significant impact on the estimation of unruh effect .",
    "thus one can prepare a proper detector by some kinds of two - level systems that possess the proper energy gap to obtain the best estimation precision .",
    "alternatively , we can get a higher precision , i.e. , a larger qfi for a longer interaction time . to sum up",
    ", we can choose the largest effective coupling strength and the longest interaction time allowed by quantum mechanics , as well as some suitable energy gaps to realizes the optimal strategy attaining the ultimate sensitivity for the estimation of the unruh effect .",
    "we have studied the relativistic quantum metrology for two entangled detectors when one of them with accelerated motion . the optimal strategy for the unruh effect estimation",
    "is obtained by employing the proper probe state preparation and by adjusting the interaction parameters in the estimation process .",
    "we employ the unruh - dewitt detector model , which has a fixed energy gap and interacts only with the neighbor field .",
    "the studied model avoids two critical technical difficulties in the estimation of the unruh temperature : a physically unfeasible detection of global free models in the full space and a non - analytical expression of qfi due to the boundary conditions of the moving cavity . in this paper",
    "the point - like detectors only couple to the neighbour field modes , and alice s and rob s detectors in the rindler region @xmath80 are causally connected .",
    "the studied modes are in fact relativistic local and only the local projective measurements are performed in the metrology process so obeys the causality .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the relativistic causality would be violated if the projective measurements are performed between the causally separated modes @xcite .",
    "fortunately , lin recently found that the violation can be suppressed by introducing restrictions on the post - measurements for the projective measurements on relativistic nonlocal modes @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the probe state preparation and the interaction parameters between rob s detector and the external field have significant influences on the value of qfi . to be specific",
    ", there are a range of energy gaps of the accelerated detector that provide us a better precision in the estimation of the unruh temperature .",
    "however , one should choose the largest effective coupling strength and the physically allowed longest interaction time to achieve the same goal .",
    "the results of this paper can be also applied to the estimation of hawking temperature of black holes and unruh temperature for non - uniformly accelerated detectors @xcite .",
