    "in spite of its crucial role to trigger the electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs sector remains unknown , and its essence is still mysterious .",
    "exploration of the higgs sector is the most important issue in current high energy physics .",
    "recent results of higgs boson searches at the tevatron and the lhc have strongly constrained the mass of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) to be from 114 gev to 145 gev  @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson is expected to be discovered in near future at the lhc as long as the sm - like picture effectively holds .    at the same time",
    "there is no strong motivation to the minimal form of the higgs sector proposed in the sm , where only one scalar doublet field is introduced .",
    "in fact , extended higgs sectors are often considered in the context of various scenarios for physics beyond the sm , in which new phenomena such as neutrino oscillation  @xcite , dark matter  @xcite and/or baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite are explained .    in order to explain tiny masses of neutrinos ,",
    "several scenarios have been proposed in the literature , in which a source of lepton number violation is introduced with additional majorana neutrinos  @xcite , a triplet scalar field  @xcite or triplet fermion fields  @xcite . in particular , the second possibility ; i.e. , the higgs triplet model ( htm ) , where a scalar triplet field with the hypercharge @xmath0 is defined by the relation of @xmath18 . ]",
    "is added to the sm , is the simplest model which deduces the extended higgs sector . assuming that the triplet scalar field carries two units of lepton number",
    ", the lepton number conservation is violated in a trilinear interaction among the higgs doublet field and the higgs triplet field .",
    "majorana masses for neutrinos are then generated through the yukawa interaction of the lepton doublet and the triplet scalar field .",
    "when the masses of the component fields of the triplet are at the tev scale or less , the model can be tested by directly detecting them , such as the doubly - charged ( @xmath19 ) , singly - charged ( @xmath20 ) and the neutral scalar bosons .",
    "in addition to the appearance of these charged scalar bosons , a striking prediction of the htm is the relationship among the masses of the component fields of the triplet scalar field ; @xmath21 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 , respectively , where @xmath22 is @xmath23 or @xmath24 with @xmath23 to be the triplet - like cp - even higgs boson and @xmath24 to be the triplet - like cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "the squired mass difference @xmath25 is determined by @xmath2 ( @xmath3 gev ) , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the doublet scalar field , and a scalar self - coupling constant .",
    "as such a mass difference is not forbidden by the symmetry of the model , we may be able to distinguish the model from the others which contain charged higgs bosons by measuring @xmath25 .",
    "namely , if we discover @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 and if we confirm the relationship mentioned above , the model could be identified .    in the previous studies ,",

    "however , in the case of @xmath35 , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the situation is changed drastically as compared to that of the @xmath13 .",

    "if @xmath25 is positive ( negative ) , @xmath8 is the heaviest ( lightest ) of all the triplet - like scalar bosons . in the case of @xmath36 , while @xmath9 can decay into @xmath37  @xcite the decay pattern of @xmath8 is the same as in the case of @xmath13 . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath16 , the cascade decay of @xmath8 dominates ;",
    "i.e. , @xmath38 as long as @xmath1 is neither too small nor too large .",
    "detailed analyses for collider signature of these processes for @xmath39 have not been studied so far .    in this paper , we focus on the phenomenology of the htm with the mass difference among the triplt - like scalar bosons at the lhc .",

    "we only have discussed the signal processes and we have not discussed backgrounds against the signal . the background analysis is beyond the scope in this paper . it would be expected that the backgrounds can be reduced after the appropriate kinematic cuts .",
    "for example , in the case of scenario ( 1b ) , the main background against the signal @xmath183 may come from @xmath184 . typically , the cross section for this background is @xmath171(1 ) pb at @xmath151 tev . in the case",

    "although the cross sections for the signal and the background are comparable at this stage , the background can be further reduced by reconstructing the top quarks by using the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath186 system and the endpoint in the transverse mass distribution of the @xmath187 system . in the case where both the @xmath92 bosons from the top quarks decay leptonicaly ; i.e. , @xmath188 , the reconstruction of the top quarks would be difficult .",

    "the cross section for the final state of the signal @xmath189 is 36 fb at @xmath151 tev .",

    "the cross section for the final state of the background would be @xmath171(10 ) fb when the miss - identification rate for a charged lepton is assumed to be @xmath195 .",
    "the cross sections for the signal and the background are comparable at this stage . in this case , although we may not be able to use the top quark reconstruction , by using the @xmath196-tagging and the cuts for the low energy jet , the background would be expected to be reduced .",
    "however , it goes without saying that the detector level simulation is necessary to clarify the feasibility of the signal .",
    "this would be a future task .",
    "in the htm , a characteristic mass spectrum @xmath197 is predicted when @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , by measuring this mass spectrum of the triplet - like scalar bosons , the model can be tested at the lhc .",

    "when @xmath114 gev , @xmath8 does not decay into the same sign dilepton so that the limit of the mass of @xmath8 from the recent results at the lhc can not be applied .",
