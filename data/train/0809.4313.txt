    "to study the linear polarization of asteroids and other point source objects , the dual - beam imaging polarimeter ( dbip ) was commissioned in march of 2007 @xcite . in august of 2007 we expanded dbip s capabilities to include analysis of circular polarization with the addition of a quarterwave plate . typically , the most important quantities for analysis are the fractional polarizations @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , expressed as percentages , and in the following text we will deal with these quantities when we refer to polarization measurements . here",
    "we present our subsequent calibration and determination of systematic errors which were found to be comparable to statistical errors for typical observing situations : @xmath4 polarization .",
    "the original setup of dbip was a serial arrangement of a halfwave plate in an encoded rotation stage , a filter and a double - calcite savart plate placed between the telescope and the @xmath5 tektronix ccd camera . to extend dbip to full - stokes sensitivity , a quarterwave plate in a rotation stage",
    "was placed ahead of the halfwave plate .",
    "this setup allows for simultaneous measurement of linear and circular polarization , though at the potential cost of increased crosstalk between polarizations , which is discussed further in  [ jrm_crosstalk ] figure  [ jrm_fig.optics ] , modified from @xcite , shows a schematic representation of the new optical path with the quarterwave plate added .",
    "as with any optical system , misalignments and imperfections in the components will lead to errors in measurement . in the case of dbip , the waveplates are the most sensitive components to these errors , as they are the only moving parts and require precisely determined angular zero - points .",
    "errors in angular alignment of the waveplate or tilt with respect to the optical axis as well as chromatic retardance or fast - axis angle variations will show up in our system as variations in measured position angle of polarization , depolarization of the signal , or crosstalk between linear and circular polarization . to minimize and quantify these errors we performed an extensive calibration campaign .",
    "our first step of calibration was to determine the alignment of the waveplate zero - points using known standard stars .",
    "having already aligned the halfwave plate against standards before the installation of the quarterwave plate @xcite , we were able to re - observe one of the same polarization standards ( ngc 2024 - 1 ) in full - stokes mode to align the quarterwave zero - point while confirming that we could reproduce the linear polarization results for this target .",
    "the set of observations of ngc 2024 - 1 , both before and after the addition of the quarterwave plate , are listed in table  [ jrm_tab.stds ] , where a circular polarization value of ``  '' indicates a measurement taken before the installation of the quarterwave plate .",

    "our measurements for both polarized and unpolarized standards agree within @xmath59 of the literature values , confirming that instrument systematics are less than a @xmath60 effect .",
    "the only exceptions to this are the observations of bd-13 5073 and wd 1615 - 154 .",
    "bd-13 5073 clearly shows evidence of variation in the amplitude and direction of polarization from the literature values over only a few years , showing it can not be depended upon as a polarized standard .",
    "our observation of wd 1615 - 154 on 6/11/08 shows",
    "anomalously high polarization compared to literature values and our previous observations at the @xmath61 level . with the current data it is unclear if the polarization properties of the object have changed or if this measurement is just an outlier .",
    "instrumental crosstalk between stokes vectors is one of the more subtle errors that can affect polarization measurements and quantifying its magnitude is a critical step toward obtaining high precision polarimetry .",
    "crosstalk between linear stokes vectors ( @xmath62 to @xmath63 or @xmath63 to @xmath62 ) happens when the zero - point location of the halfwave retarder is offset from the defined @xmath62 direction , and is easily corrected by aligning the waveplate , as discussed above in ",
    "[ jrm_align ] crosstalk from circular to linear and back ( @xmath64 to @xmath65 or @xmath65 to @xmath64 ) can be caused by waveplate offsets or by variations in retardance of the wave - plates as a function of wavelength , position on the plate , etc .    to fully determine the instrumental crosstalk , light with a known polarization",
    "must be sent through the instrument and measured upon exiting .",
    "it is possible to do this by installing polarizers just in front of the instrument during observations ( recent examples include * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) , however due to limited observing time and space in the optical path this was not a feasible calibration method for dbip . instead , we performed lab bench calibrations to quantify instrumental crosstalk .    to measure @xmath65 to @xmath64 crosstalk we sent a collimated light source through a linear polarizer into dbip and measured one of the two exiting beams with a precision photodiode .",
    "by stepping the angular position of the input linear polarizer , we were able to fully characterize this linear - to - circular crosstalk . to measure @xmath64 to @xmath65 crosstalk a fixed quarterwave plate was installed after the linear polarizer . by stepping the linear polarizer again",
    ", we were able to vary the input polarization from circular to linear and back and characterize this circular - to - linear crosstalk .",
    "figure  [ jrm_fig.crosstalk ] shows our measured polarization state for both setups as the input linear polarizer was stepped through @xmath66degrees .",
    "sinusoids describe the behavior of the polarization vectors in both setups and were fit with a chi - squared minimizer to the data to determine percentage crosstalk as well as any depolarization from the optics .",
    "we find that the circular polarization measured when inputing pure linearly polarized light had an amplitude of @xmath67 and an offset of @xmath68 , with crosstalk preferentially occurring when both q and u are positive ( around @xmath69 on our plot ) .",
    "we measure a depolarization of both linear signals varying from @xmath70 near @xmath69 to @xmath71 near @xmath72 .",
    "since these crosstalk errors are only a few percent of the input signal , for sources with `` typical '' polarizations ( i.e. @xmath73 ) the crosstalk error is comparable to the desired statistical errors of @xmath4 polarization , as we measured for our polarized and unpolarized standards .    for the measurement of circular - to - linear crosstalk , we find a small amount of linear @xmath74 polarization generated from a purely circularly polarized input beam , preferentially when @xmath75 is input .",
    "note that the phased oscillation of @xmath76 and @xmath74 indicate a small misalignment of the quarterwave plate axes with the instrument - defined @xmath62 orientation , while it is the slight phase offset between @xmath77 and @xmath78 that is produced by the crosstalk .",
    "we also see clear evidence for a depolarization of the circularly polarized signal at the level of @xmath71 of the input polarization . for targets with total circular polarizations less than a few percent",
    "these errors should be comparable the @xmath60 noise error typically obtained in our observations .",
    "we have presented the results of our extended commissioning of dbip into full - stokes mode .",
    "crosstalk values are shown to be small and can be ignored for objects with `` typical '' ( i.e. @xmath79 ) polarizations . with errors well constrained",
    "dbip is now available for scientific studies of linear and circular polarization of point sources in the optical .",
    "dbip has already been successfully used to characterize the polarization - phase curves of asteroids with some of the most pristine compositions in the inner solar system @xcite and a number of other programs to study small solar system bodies are currently under way .",
