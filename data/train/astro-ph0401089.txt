    "the substructure of dark - matter haloes is a topic of interest in cosmology , especially due to its relevance to the cold - dark - matter model , which requires some degree of clumpiness to the matter distribution . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite argue that substructure provides the best explanation ( originally proposed by @xcite ) of the anomalous flux ratios found in gravitational lens systems . however , the observed number of dwarf galaxy satellites in the local group is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the number of subhaloes found in numerical simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "observable statistics of the matter distribution provide an approach to substructure studies that is complementary to studies of strong - lens systems or direct observations of satellite galaxies .",
    "substructure effects are expected to produce an observable effect in the power spectrum in the next generation of lensing surveys .",
    "as we show in this paper , substructure effects in the weak - lensing regime probe cluster scales primarily , as opposed to strong - lensing systems , which probe galactic scales .",
    "the halo model provides a description of non - linear gravitational clustering which allows statistical quantities of interest to be efficiently computed .",
    "the essential concepts of the halo model were used by @xcite to describe the spatial distribution of galaxies over fifty years ago .",
    "their results were later generalized by @xcite . by combining the formalism of scherrer & bertschinger with results from @xmath0-body simulations such as a halo density profile",
    "( e.g. that of @xcite ) and a halo mass function and bias parameters ( e.g , @xcite ) , one is able to calculate various dark - matter and galaxy clustering statistics ( @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive review of the halo model .",
    "most work on the halo model approximates haloes as spherically symmetric objects , described by a mass density which is a smoothly - decreasing function only of the distance from the halo centre .",
    "however , the density distribution of haloes which form in @xmath0-body simulations is not at all smooth ( @xcite ) .",
    "rather , one finds that about 10 per cent of the mass is associated with subhaloes ( @xcite ) . in the large - scale structure literature to date , the effects of halo substructure are typically assumed to be small for purposes of calculating statistics of the dark - matter distribution .",
    "this paper explores the validity of this assumption .",
    "we will make quantitative statements about the size of substructure effects on the 2d and 3d dark - matter power spectra and bispectra .",
    "we will identify the length and angular scales at which halo substructure becomes important .",
    "the results of @xmath0-body simulations also suggest a distribution of halo concentration parameters ( @xcite ) . like substructure ,",
    "this effect is often ignored , though the formalism to include it in the halo model is straightforward ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper will quantify the effect of a concentration parameter distribution on the power spectra .",
    "to model substructure in a halo , the total mass @xmath1 of the halo is divided into a smoothly distributed component of mass @xmath2 , and the remaining mass @xmath3 is placed in subhaloes .",
    "we will use the terms subhalo and subclump interchangeably . ignoring substructure ,",
    "the halo model requires specification of the halo density profile and the mass function , i.e. the number density of haloes of a given mass . to include substructure",
    ", one must specify not only the density profile of the smooth component , the fourier transform of which we denote @xmath4 , but also the density profile of the subhaloes , with fourier transform @xmath5 .",
    "the mass factors simply provide the proper normalization ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are normalized to unity .",
    "suitable mass functions for the number density both of parent haloes , @xmath8 , and of subhaloes , @xmath9 , are also needed .",
    "in addition , the distribution of subhaloes within the parent halo must be specified .",
    "we denote its fourier transform by @xmath10 . using these ingredients ,",
    "@xcite derive expressions for the power spectrum and the bispectrum .",
    "we give some results from their paper that are relevant to this work in the appendix .",

    "the normalization constant is fixed by requiring that all mass be contained within a parent halo , and turns out to be @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    ", we use the fitting formula of @xcite .",
    "we use haloes with mean interior density 180 times the background density and take @xmath20 and @xmath21 , so that our mass function is universal ( @xcite ) . the notation of this paper reflects our choice of halo boundary : @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the usual scale radius parameter of the halo density profile .",
    "we use the density profile of @xcite , hereafter nfw , for both the smooth component and the subhaloes .",
    "it s fourier transform is most efficient to compute using sine and cosine integrals : @xmath26                  - \\rmn{ci}(\\kappa)\\right\\ }                - \\frac{\\sin{\\kappa c}}{\\kappa(1 + c)},\\ ] ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 we assume the distribution of subhaloes within a parent halo follows the mass distribution of the smooth component .",
    "that is , @xmath30 is also given by the nfw profile , normalized to unity .",
    "simulations suggest that the abundance of subhaloes in the parent halo traces the density profile of the parent quite well except in the most dense region near its centre where the abundance of subhaloes is lessened due to tidal disruptions .",
    "the subhalo abundance in the inner region is not yet well resolved in simulations .",
    "@xcite propose a modified nfw profile that is constant or zero inside of a core radius which they take to be 1020 kpc for a @xmath31-@xmath32 halo .",
    "for a halo of this mass , only 4 per cent of its matter lies within the core radius .",
    "hence , were we to use the latter profile , the effect would be to move only 4 per cent of our subhaloes further from the centre .",
    "we will comment briefly on the effect we expect this to have on the power spectrum in the discussion .",
    "we use the concentration parameters found by @xcite , for all three profiles at redshift @xmath33 , which are @xmath34^{-0.13 }                   \\quad \\rmn{(smooth)},\\ ] ] for the smooth component of a halo and @xmath35^{-0.30 }                   \\quad \\rmn{(subhalo)},\\ ] ] for all subhaloes .",

    "we use these values unless otherwise noted .",
    "in addition , simulations suggest that subhaloes heavier than 1 per cent of the total mass in the parent halo are rare ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , so we only include subhaloes with masses @xmath55 .",

    "it is likely that a space - based deep imaging survey will offer the best prospects for probing the small scales where substructure effects are important .",
    "we adopt parameters expected for the _ snap _ satellite lensing survey ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath73 , @xmath74 per cent , @xmath75 .",
    "we use the covariance of the power spectrum to perform a least - squares fitting to a fiducial model @xmath76 by calculating @xmath39 , @xmath77 and identifying @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 contours as those with @xmath81 2.30 , 6.17 and 11.8 , respectively , which is appropriate for the two - parameter fits we will use .",
    "we use a @xmath82 cosmological model with parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and the bbks transfer function ( @xcite ) with the shape parameter of @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fractions ] compares halo - model calculations of the three - dimensional power spectrum with the non - linear fitting formula of @xcite . in this figure ,",
    "different fractions of the halo mass are placed in substructure .",
    "adding substructure can be seen to increase power at scales @xmath88 .",
    "substructure models predict more power than smith et al .  for @xmath89 ,",
    "but the model with 10 per cent of the halo mass in substructure shows better agreement at smaller scales ( though it should be noted that smith et al .",
    "has been extrapolated beyond @xmath90 ) .",
    "the power spectrum is fairly insensitive to the exponent of the subhalo mass function , @xmath91 .",
    "reducing @xmath91 from 0.9 to 0.7 can increase the power spectrum by about 4 per cent at length scales @xmath88 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contrib ] we divide the power spectrum into contributions from the various terms in equations ( [ eq : p_ss])([eq : p_2h ] ) . on scales",
    "@xmath92 , the substructure contribution to the power spectrum is dominated by the density correlation between the smooth component of the parent halo and a subclump , denoted @xmath93 .",
    "the correlation of the density in a single subclump , @xmath94 , or between two different subclumps , @xmath95 , is negligible for parameter values of interest except for very high wavenumbers ( where baryonic effects are likely to play a role ) .",
    "one should also note that the power of the smooth component only , @xmath96 , still dominates all other contributions on all scales considered , except for the largest scales where the two - halo term , @xmath97 , models the linear power spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contribmass ] , we leave the integral over subhalo mass uncalculated for the @xmath94 and @xmath93 terms , so that one can see which subhalo masses provide the most power .",
    "the figures suggest that most of the extra power due to substructure between @xmath98 , comes from subhaloes of mass @xmath99 .",
    "subhaloes of this mass are likely contained in parent haloes of mass @xmath100@xmath101 .",
    "finally , since the weak - lensing efficiency peaks for @xmath102@xmath103 , the conclusion is that the weak - lensing power spectrum can probe intermediate - redshift group and cluster mass haloes ( provided the signal - to - noise permits its measurement as discussed below ) .",
    "this should make weak lensing as a probe of substructure a good complement to studies of strong lensing of quasars , which probe substructure in galactic haloes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_models ] we plot a number of power spectra calculated with various models .",
    "henceforth , curves titled ` bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ' and ` huffenberger & seljak ( 2003 ) ' refer to halo - model calculations without substructure , using the concentration parameters found in those references .",
    "it should be noted that huffenberger & seljak obtained their concentration parameter by fitting to @xcite only up @xmath104 .",
    "both huffenberger & seljak and smith et al .",
    "have been extrapolated beyond @xmath104 , and the apparently poor agreement of their model with smith et al .  beyond this wavelength",
    "should be attributed to this extrapolation .",
    "it is apparent that adding either substructure or the concentration parameter distribution affects power only on scales @xmath105 .",
    "substructure provides a 1060 per cent increase in power on the scales @xmath106 , with the largest factor corresponding to the smallest scales .",
    "the @xmath107-distribution provides only a 610 per cent increase in power over the same scales .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the substructure model increases power relative to @xcite or @xcite , the concentration parameter of @xcite decreases the relative power . and so , while all models may be consistent with smith et al .  at scales",
    "@xmath108 , the better model should reveal itself as smaller scales are probed in higher - resolution simulations and observations .",
    "if the halo model is an appropriate physical description of mass clustering , then the substructure model presented here should provide the most robust predictions for the power spectrum on small scales .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_kappa ] we show the dimensionless convergence power spectrum predictions for the various models , assuming source galaxies at redshift 1 .",
    "again , @xmath107-distribution and substructure each provide about a 10 per cent increase in power at small scales , though the effect of substructure gets larger for the smallest scales .",
    "the halo - model calculations are discrepant with @xcite at the 1020 per cent level .",
    "most of the contribution to @xmath109 for @xmath110 comes from @xmath111 with @xmath112 . at these scales ,",
    "the transition between the one - halo and two - halo terms is important . @xcite",
    "have proposed a scale - dependent correction to the bias parameter and a method to account for halo exclusion that may improve the halo model on intermediate scales .",
    "@xcite employ an approximate correction for halo exclusion to obtain a more well - behaved three - point correlation function on scales @xmath113 .",
    "given the error bars expected from future surveys , it is clear that improved precision in simulations as well as model predictions is needed . some additional cosmological models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_kappamodels ] , which we will comment more on shortly .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : q_eq ] and [ fig : q_kappa ] , we plot the predicted three - dimensional bispectrum and convergence bispectrum .",
    "it is interesting to note that , though substructure increases the bispectra , it causes a decrease in the reduced bispectra .",
    "that is , the substructure contribution to the power spectrum factor in the denominator exceeds its contribution to the numerator in the reduced bispectrum .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dominant substructure terms are the smooth - subclump for the power spectrum and the smooth - smooth - subclump term for the bispectrum .",
    "the @xmath93 term scales as @xmath114 , while the @xmath115 term scales as @xmath116 , so the reduced bispectrum scales as @xmath117 over most scales .",
    "thus by using both the bispectrum and power spectrum , degeneracies between the substructure fraction and other cosmological parameters can be broken .",
    "we discuss this further in section [ sec : discussion ] .    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcontrib ] is the substructure contribution to the bispectrum separated into each of the terms in equations ( [ eq : b_sss])([eq : b_3c ] ) . on the scales of interest ,",
    "the substructure contributions to the bispectrum are dominated by the smooth - smooth - subclump term , @xmath115 , and the bispectrum for individual subclumps , @xmath118 .",
    "the meaning of these terms is discussed more completely in the appendix .",
    "it is interesting that the bispectrum contribution from single subhaloes , @xmath118 , provides a larger contribution than the smooth component alone , @xmath119 , for @xmath120 , but on these scales a purely gravitational calculation is not likely to be valid .",
    "results from the _ wmap _ satellite have constrained the tilt and run of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "tilt affects the small scale power in a way similar to substructure ( cf .",
    "[ fig : p_kappamodels ] ) , so we consider next the feasibility of weak lensing to separate the effects of substructure from tilt and run in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "the results of examining the three parameter @xmath121 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] .",
    "we use the @xmath122 per cent substructure model as the fiducial model , and calculate the @xmath39 for @xmath109 relative to the fiducial model using modes in the range @xmath110 .",
    "the covariance matrix used is that in equation ( [ eq : covariance ] ) . in the upper panel ,",
    "we assume no running and use @xmath123 for the fiducial model . in the lower panel ,",
    "we fix @xmath124 and allow a running spectral index , as described in @xcite , to vary about a fiducial value of @xmath125 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that we do not marginalize over the third parameter in these figures .",
    "we also apply priors as expected from the upcoming _",
    "mission : @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these figures suggest that with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) priors , future surveys that can measure @xmath128 down to 0.1-arcmin scales can constrain the substructure mass fraction to about @xmath129 per cent .",
    "we have shown that on small scales , the contribution of cdm substructure is important in accurate predictions of the power spectrum . in particular , it may help resolve the small scale discrepancy between @xmath0-body simulation results and the halo model .",
    "our model with 10 per cent substructure and a concentration parameter distribution fits the small scale power spectrum extrapolated from @xcite quite well .",
    "higher - resolution @xmath0-body simulations are needed to test our model .",
    "we agree with @xcite that a concentration parameter distribution alone can not resolve the discrepancy between the halo model and @xcite .",
    "we have shown , however , that the distribution increases power on small scales by about 10 per cent , which is comparable to the accuracy of the smith et al .",
    "hence the scatter in the concentration parameter needs to be taken into account on scales smaller than @xmath130 .",
    "our examination of the prospects for parameter constraints are by no means complete .",
    "a more careful treatment must marginalize over a larger parameter space @xmath131 , and account for survey limitations such as intrinsic alignment of source galaxies , the limits imposed by galaxy deblending issues and b - mode contamination .",
    "most parameters , like @xmath132 and @xmath133 , are not very degenerate with substructure , since they affect the power spectrum and bispectrum on all scales , while substructure modifies the statistics only on small scales .",
    "such parameters can be well constrained from large scale information and probably not confuse a measurement of @xmath51 . moreover ,",
    "other observations constrain @xmath132 and @xmath133 , such as the cosmic microwave background , supernovae observations , galaxy clusters and galaxy clustering statistics .",
    "the situation is similar for neutrino mass and baryon fraction , though to a somewhat lesser extent .",
    "while these parameters affect the lensing power spectrum they also produce some suppression on scales with @xmath134 where substructure has little effect .",
    "this will help us to constrain @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath51 separately .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "results suggest that neutrinos are less massive than 0.2 ev ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that the power spectrum is much less sensitive to such neutrinos than substructure at the 10 per cent level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p_kappamodels ] ) . with regard to baryons ,",
    "their abundance is well constrained from cmb data and big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "future observations are expected to reveal baryon oscillations in the weak - lensing signal which will allow for even tighter constraints on the baryon abundance .",
    "the effects of the parameters @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which denote the normalization and slope of the halo concentration and the inner slope of the halo profile , can be separated from substructure effects with information from the reduced bispectrum . as we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , substructure produces a proportionately larger increase in the power spectrum than in the equilateral bispectrum .",
    "the result is that substructure amplifies the power spectrum , but attenuates the reduced bispectrum .",
    "this differs from the behavior of @xmath137 , @xmath139 and @xmath138 , as demonstrated by @xcite , who find that these two parameters change the power spectrum and reduced bispectrum in the same sense .    of the parameters considered , the tilt and run of the primordial power spectrum appear to produce an effect most similar to halo substructure . our analysis in the previous section shows that the next generation of weak - lensing surveys will likely provide interesting @xmath140 and @xmath141 constraints .",
    "applying priors such as results from the _ planck _ mission to these constraints should allow a detection of substructure .",
    "we find that a substructure mass fraction constraint at the @xmath129 per cent is possible if observational errors can be controlled .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that , as a result of tidal disruptions in particular , a modified nfw profile for the distribution of subhaloes in the parent halo may be more appropriate .",
    "as we have already pointed out , simulations have not yet provided us with a definitive substructure - abundance profile for the centre - most regions of halos . even taking the abundance to be zero within a core radius of order 10 kpc , as in @xcite",
    ", we would redistribute only 4 per cent of our subhaloes .",
    "so while the magnitude of the @xmath93 term may be decreased by this order on @xmath142-@xmath143 scales , smaller scales are dominated by the @xmath94 contribution ( cf .",
    "[ fig : contrib ] ) , which does not depend on the subhalo distribution .",
