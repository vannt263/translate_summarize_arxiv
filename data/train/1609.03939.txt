    "although the existence of dark matter ( dm ) constituting about 27% of the energy budget of our universe  @xcite is by now well established through various cosmological and astrophysical observations , very little is known about its particle nature and interactions . while the standard @xmath0cdm model with collisionless cold dm ( cdm ) successfully explains the large - scale structure formation by the hierarchical clustering of dm fluctuations  @xcite , there are some unresolved issues on galactic and sub - galactic scales , such as the core - cusp  @xcite , missing satellite  @xcite and too big to fail  @xcite problems .",
    "all these small - scale structure anomalies can in principle be resolved if the dm is made up of ultralight bosons that form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , i.e. a single coherent macroscopic wave function with long range correlation ; for a review , see e.g. ,  ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are two classes of bec dm , depending on whether dm self interactions are present or not . without any self interactions , the quantum pressure of localized particles is sufficient to stabilize the dm halo against gravitational collapse only for a very light dm with mass @xmath1 ev  @xcite , whereas a small repulsive self - interaction can allow a much wider range of dm masses up to @xmath2 ev  @xcite .",
    "concrete particle physics examples for bec dm are wisps ( weakly interacting slim particles )  @xcite , which include the qcd axion or axion - like particles  @xcite and spin-1 hidden bosons ubiquitous in string theories  @xcite , but our subsequent discussion will be generically applicable to any bec dm with a repulsive self - interaction .    the observational consequences on structure formation mentioned above can not distinguish a bec dm from an ordinary self - interacting dm  @xcite .",
    "existing distinction methods include enhanced integrated sachs - wolfe effect  @xcite , tidal torquing of galactic halos  @xcite , and effects on cosmic microwave background matter power spectrum  @xcite . in this paper , we propose a new method to probe the bec dm parameter space using gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomy , inspired by the recent discovery of transient gw signal at ligo  @xcite . in particular , we show that if the gw passes through a bec dm halo on their way to earth , the small spacetime distortions associated with them could produce phononic excitations in the bec medium which in turn induce a small but potentially observable change in the speed of gw , while the speed of light remains unchanged",
    ". this approach might be very effective if any of the future multi - messenger searches for gamma - ray , optical , @xmath3-ray , or neutrino counterparts to gw signal become successful .",
    "on the contrary , a lack of any observable deviation in the speed of gw will put stringent constraints on the bec dm scenario .",
    "in fact , we find that even with the current ligo sensitivity , it might be possible to completely rule out the bec dm parameter space otherwise preferred by existing cosmological data .",
    "the cosmological dynamics of bec dm can be described by a single quantum scalar field @xmath4 , with the effective lagrangian @xmath5 analogous to the ginzburg - landau free energy density in a neutral superfluid .",
    "we have assumed that the dm particles do not have any interactions with the standard model ( sm ) particles , so a real scalar field will suffice for our discussion , but choosing it complex will not significantly change our results . in eq .  , we have considered a simple renormalizable scalar potential with only quadratic and quartic terms , the latter providing a repulsive quartic self - interaction for the dm , as required in addition to the quantum pressure of localized particles to stabilize the dm halo core against gravitational collapse . for @xmath6 ( i.e.  no self - interaction ) ,",
    "the quantum pressure is sufficient only if @xmath1 ev , a scenario known as fuzzy dm  @xcite . in principle , we could also also have added a cubic term @xmath7 to eq .  ; however , for the self - interaction to be repulsive in the non - relativistic limit , we must have @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we do not include any higher - dimensional operators , which are usually subdominant compared to the renormalizable ones considered here .",
    "using eq .",
    ", we calculate the stress - energy tensor @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the spacetime metric . in presence of a gw ,",
    "the linearized spacetime metric is usually written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the flat minkowski metric ( in particle physics conventions ) and @xmath13 is a small perturbation . to leading order , the background mean field values of the energy density @xmath14 and pressure @xmath15 of the bec medium",
    "are related by the equation of state @xmath16    however , the small spacetime distortions caused by the propagation of gw get amplified in the bec medium .",
    "this is because almost all particles in the bec system are condensed into the lowest energy available state with very long de broglie wavelength , and gravity is a long - range force .",
    "therefore , although gravitational interactions among particles are extremely weak , the massless phonon modes in the ground state of the scalar wave function can be excited by the gw  @xcite , which then slowly propagate in the medium .",
    "the effective metric of the bec phononic excitations on the flat spacetime metric can be written as  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number density of the background mean field and @xmath19 is the speed of sound obtained from the background equation of state  . using the effective metric   in eq .  , we get the new equation of state @xmath20 } \\",
    "\\equiv \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\lambda}{m^4}\\rho^2 \\ , , \\label{eq : eos2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective change in the bec energy density due to the phononic excitations is given by @xmath21 , with @xmath22^{1/2 } \\ , ,   \\label{eq : kappa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by comparing the new equation of state   with the background equation of state  .",
    "analogous to the case of light traveling through a dense medium , gw propagating in a medium of matter with density @xmath23 will experience an induced refractive index , arising from the coordinate - dependent gravitational potential corrections to the newtonian metric  @xcite , of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is newton s constant ( @xmath26 gev being the reduced planck mass ) , and @xmath27 is the angular frequency ( @xmath28 being the frequency ) of the gw .",
    "due to the planck mass suppression in eq .  , the resulting effect on the propagation speed of gw , @xmath29 ( in units of @xmath30 )",
    ", is unobservable  @xcite for a conventional dm halo with average density @xmath31 .",
    "however , the key difference for a bec medium is that the gw will experience an enhanced effective matter density @xmath32 that amplifies the change in refractive index by a factor of @xmath33 [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , i.e. @xmath34 this can be understood qualitatively from energy conservation arguments , since the phononic excitation by the propagation of gw must have a back - reaction effect on the propagating gravitons , thus inducing an effective mass for the graviton and slowing them down by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , a constraint on the speed of gw can be directly translated into a constraint on the @xmath36 parameter space of bec dm , as we show below .",
    "let us assume that the gw produced at a distance @xmath37 encounters a spherical bec dm halo of radius @xmath38 en route to earth .",
    "thus , the average distance they propagate through the dm halo with a reduced speed @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and the corresponding average fraction of distance @xmath41 the effective speed of gw is then given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the proper time elapsed between the emission and detection of the gw signal .",
    "so the change in the speed of gw from the speed of light in vacuum due to its encounter with the bec dm halo is given by @xmath44 this is our key result that will be used to put new constraints on the bec dm properties .",
    "the radius of the gravitationally bound bec with a repulsive self - interaction is independent of the central density and the mass of the system , and depends only on the physical characteristics of the particles in the condensate  @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47-wave scattering length which in the low - energy limit is defined by @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the wavenumber ) . for the interaction lagrangian given by eq .",
    ", we find @xmath50 and hence , from eq .",
    ", @xmath51 when substituted in eq .",
    ", this relates the fraction @xmath52 to the microscopic properties of the bec dm .",
    "similarly , the density distribution of a static , spherically - symmetric bec dm halo can be obtained from the solution to the lane - emden equation in the weak field , thomas - fermi regime , given by the analytic form  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the central density of the condensate .",
    "the average density of a bec dm halo is thus given by @xmath56 which will be used in our eq .  .",
    "using eq .  , we numerically calculate the _ maximum _ possible deviation in the speed of gw @xmath57 as a function of the microscopic bec dm parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 for given values of the source distance @xmath37 and the gw frequency @xmath28 . for illustration",
    ", we will fix the central core density at @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the solar mass ) , which is within the range suggested by a recent @xmath62-body simulation of self - interacting dm  @xcite .",
    "we also take @xmath63 mpc and @xmath64 hz as representative values following the gw150914 event at ligo  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the dm particle is varied in the range @xmath65 $ ] ev . the upper limit comes from the basic condition that the particle s de broglie wavelength , @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the virial velocity and we set @xmath68 ) should be larger than the inter - particle spacing , @xmath69 , such that the wave functions of the individual particles in the system overlap with each other to form a bec .",
    "the de broglie wavelength also sets a natural lower limit to the core size of equilibrium bec - dm halos that can form ; taking @xmath70 kpc , the size of dm halo of a typical dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy , we get the lower limit of @xmath71 ev , which is saturated in the fuzzy dm scenario  @xcite .    with this choice of parameters ,",
    "we find the maximum @xmath72 that can be induced by bec dm is at the level of @xmath73 .",
    "thus we need the experimental sensitivity of @xmath74 at this level or below to be able to put constraints on the bec dm parameter space using our method . for comparison ,",
    "the current best model - independent bound is @xmath75  @xcite , deduced from the absence of gravitational cherenkov radiation allowing for the unimpeded propagation of high - energy cosmic rays across our galaxy .",
    "recently , assuming that the short gamma - ray burst above 50 kev detected by fermi - gbm  @xcite just 0.4 seconds after the detection of gw150914 at ligo  @xcite originated from the same location , more stringent limits on @xmath72 have been derived  @xcite . while a typical time - of - flight analysis  @xcite gives @xmath76  @xcite , using modified energy dispersion relations ( typical of many quantum gravity models ) with the quantum gravity scale @xmath77 yields a much stronger limit of @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "however , whether the fermi - gbm event originates from the same astrophysical source responsible for gw150914 is a controversial issue  @xcite and according to a recent analysis  @xcite , the gbm event is more likely a background fluctuation , which is consistent with the non - detection of similar gamma - ray events at swift  @xcite , integral  @xcite and agile  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , after the detection of the second ligo event gw151226  @xcite , the multi - messenger searches have become more intense and now include searches for gamma - ray  @xcite , @xmath3-ray  @xcite , optical  @xcite and neutrino  @xcite counterparts . with more gw events expected from ligo in the near future ,",
    "these multi - messenger searches are likely to detect events coming from the same source and improve the limits on @xmath72 significantly .",
    "since the change in refractive index in a bec medium is inversely proportional to the square of the gw frequency , a future space - based gw interferometer , such as elisa  @xcite with a lower operational frequency range of @xmath79100 mhz can further improve the sensitivity .",
    "for instance , for @xmath80 mhz , @xmath81 gpc and @xmath55 same as above , the maximum @xmath72 that can be induced by bec dm is at the level of @xmath82 .",
    "pulsar timing arrays , such as the ones united under ipta  @xcite and ska  @xcite , probe much lower frequencies around 110 nhz and are capable of bringing @xmath57 close to its current upper bound , irrespective of the success of multi - messenger searches .    in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we translate the upper limit on @xmath83 to an exclusion region in the @xmath36 plane using eq .   for two values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for comparison , we also show the region which gives @xmath86 ( blue shaded ) , as preferred by @xmath62-body simulations to explain the small - scale structure anomalies , while being consistent with all observational constraints from colliding galaxy clusters  @xcite and halo shapes  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the viability of the bec dm halo model   to fit the rotational curves of the most dm - dominated low surface brightness and dsph galaxies from different surveys implies @xmath8710 kpc  @xcite , which can be translated to a preferred range of @xmath8818 ev , as shown by the dark green shaded region in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "most of this region is also consistent with the constraint on the total energy density of the relativistic species from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite .",
    "note that the region of intersection between the blue and green shaded areas gives the physically preferred value of @xmath89 , as shown by the yellow point . for @xmath90 , this value",
    "is still allowed , whereas for @xmath91 , this is excluded .",
    "we find that for the ligo frequency range @xmath92350 hz , the physical region can be completely excluded for @xmath93@xmath85 , which should be soon achievable in the multi - messenger approach .",
    "apart from the observational constraints , one should also satisfy important theoretical constraints from the bec formation requirements .",
    "the purple shaded region in figure  [ fig:1 ] is excluded as the relaxation time @xmath94 in the virialized dm clumps due to the scattering process @xmath95 exceeds the age of the universe @xmath96 , which sets a lower limit on the self - interaction strength @xmath97 for the bec to form  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the black shaded region in the top left part of the parameter space is disfavored , as the critical temperature @xmath98  @xcite below which a bec can form , falls below the temperature of the universe at the source redshift of @xmath99 , which means the bec dm halo could not have formed at the time the gw was emitted from the binary black hole merger event gw150914 .",
    "if we assume the dm particles were in thermal equilibrium with the sm particles ( through some additional interactions not shown in eq .  ) , this constraint becomes more severe , as in this case , @xmath100 is required to be larger than the bbn temperature @xmath101 mev .",
    "finally , an average halo size larger than about 1 mpc seems unrealistic for self - interacting dm halos and disfavored by simulations  @xcite ; this excludes the cyan shaded region in figure  [ fig:1 ] .     of @xmath73 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "here we have used @xmath64 hz for the gw frequency and @xmath63 mpc for the source distance as representative values from the event gw150914 .",
    "the blue band corresponding to @xmath102(0.011 ) @xmath103/g is the preferred range for a self - interacting dm to solve the small - scale structure anomalies .",
    "the dark green band corresponds to a bec dm halo with radius @xmath10410 kpc , as preferred by fits to dsph galaxy rotation curves .",
    "the overlap of the blue and green regions is physically favored , as shown by the yellow point which is completely within the exclusion region for @xmath91 .",
    "the purple shaded region in the bottom half is excluded as the relaxation time to form a bec exceeds the age of the universe .",
    "the black shaded region in the top left corner is excluded as the critical temperature falls below the temperature of the thermal plasma at the time of source redshift @xmath99 , and above the dashed black line , it falls below the bbn temperature . in the shaded region above the cyan solid line , the average halo size @xmath105 exceeds 1 mpc .",
    "the dark blue dashed line gives a light deflection angle of @xmath106 due to gravitational lensing by the intervening bec dm halo along the line of sight .",
    "see text for more details.,width=321 ]",
    "in the multi - messenger approach , one way to confirm the existence of a bec dm halo in the path of the gw is by studying the deflection of photons passing through the region where galactic rotation curves are flat .",
    "the deflection angle is given by the standard formula  @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the impact parameter ( i.e. distance of closest approach ) for which we use the radius of the bec dm halo from eq .",
    "and @xmath109 is the total mass of the dm halo , given by @xmath110 using eq .   for the density profile .",
    ".   is valid in the limit @xmath111 which is satisfied in our case , as long as @xmath112 .",
    "thus , for a bec dm halo , we can express eq .",
    "completely in terms of the microscopic parameters : @xmath113 in figure  [ fig:1 ] , we show the value of @xmath106 corresponding to a halo radius of @xmath114 kpc , as expected for the physically interesting ( yellow ) point . for other values of @xmath38",
    ", the prediction for the deflection angle can be readily obtained from eq .  .",
    "we should also clarify that the gravitational potential of the intervening dm halo along the line of sight will cause a shapiro time delay  @xcite for gw , as well as their multi - messenger counterparts . in the geometrical optics approximation , treating the total gravitating mass as a point source , the time delay is the same for gw , photons and neutrinos , given by the general formula  @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a parametrized post - newtonian parameter .",
    "however , this geometrical approximation breaks down for gw with wavelengths larger than the size of the lensing object , which corresponds to lens masses less than approximately @xmath117 , and it can induce an arrival time difference between the gw and photons / neutrinos of up to @xmath118  @xcite . for @xmath119 kpc",
    ", we estimate the mass of bec dm halo from eq .   to be @xmath120 ;",
    "so for the ligo frequency range of 10 - 500 hz , the geometrical optics approximation   remains valid and there is no relative shapiro time delay to be considered in the multi - messenger analysis .",
    "however , for smaller frequencies , such as those relevant for elisa , the additional time delay must be taken into account while deriving experimental bounds on @xmath72 .",
    "we have proposed a new method to probe bose - einstein condensate dark matter using gravitational waves .",
    "we have shown that gws passing through a bec dm halo will get appreciably slowed down due to energy loss in phononic excitations .",
    "the effective refractive index depends only on the mass and quartic coupling of the dm particles , apart from the frequency of the propagating gw .",
    "thus , an observable deviation @xmath72 in the speed of gw can be used to put stringent constraints on the bec dm parameter space , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the physically interesting region of bec dm parameter space satisfying all existing constraints can be completely probed by this new method for @xmath121@xmath85 in the ligo frequency range , which is soon achievable in a multi - messenger approach to gw astronomy .",
