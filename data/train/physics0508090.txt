    "the field of cold molecules is rapidly developing , since many research groups are working at the production of dense samples of cold ( @xmath11 k ) or ultracold ( @xmath2 100 @xmath3k ) molecules @xcite .",
    "moreover , the field of molecular condensates has opened recently , with experimental evidence for molecules formed in a degenerate gas , starting either from an atomic bose - einstein condensate @xcite , or from an atomic fermi gas @xcite . this intense activity is motivated by possible applications to very precise measurements ( lifetimes , checks on parity violation , determination of a possible dipole moment of the electron as a check for the standard model in elementary particles ) , bose - einstein condensation of complex systems ( molecule laser ) , or the emergence of a new ultracold chemistry .    among the various routes to produce ultracold molecules ,",
    "photoassociation has emerged as a purely optical technique starting from an assembly of laser - cooled atoms in a trap .",
    "the reaction takes place when a pair of ground state atoms interacting via the potential @xmath4 absorbs a photon red - detuned compared to the atomic line . at resonance , one vibrational level in an excited electronic potential @xmath5 of the molecule is populated .",
    "the reaction can be interpreted as a vertical transition at large distances , forming a long range molecule .",
    "we shall consider the example of two cold cesium atoms colliding in the lower triplet @xmath6 potential and forming a molecule in a vibrational level @xmath7 of the @xmath8 potential .",
    "the first experimental observation of ultracold cs@xmath9 molecules has made use of this reaction @xcite .    in order to make molecules in the _ ground _ or _",
    "lower triplet state _",
    ", the photoassociation step must be followed by a stabilization step .",
    "the photoassociated molecules are short - lived and decay via spontaneous emission , most often through a vertical transition at large interatomic distances @xmath10 giving back a pair of atoms . however ,",
    "specific mechanisms which favor radiative decay at shorter distances exist and allow for populating bound vibrational levels in the potential @xmath11 ( or possibly , for instance in case of heteronuclear dimers , to another potential correlated to the same asymptote  @xcite ) . in the special case of the double well @xmath8 excited potential of cs@xmath9 , the smooth barrier between the two wells acts as a `` speed bump '' and slows down the vibrational motion in the external well such that vertical transitions can take place at intermediate distances @xmath12 .",
    "stable molecules formed by spontaneous emission through this mechanism have been detected in a mot @xcite .",
    "other efficient stabilization mechanisms such as resonant coupling @xcite exist .    in a condensate , in order to retain coherence , spontaneous emission should be avoided and a stabilization step involving stimulated emission should be implemented within a two - color experiment .",
    "however , with continuous wave ( cw ) lasers such experiments are hardly feasible since the scheme is fully reversible : population is pumped back from bound levels of the ground state to the excited state , and then to continuum levels of the ground state , i.e. the molecule is dissociated .",
    "the use of laser pulses becomes thus unavoidable .    in previous work",
    "@xcite , the possibility to increase the efficiency of the photoassociation reaction by use of chirped laser pulses was considered .",
    "the frequency of such pulses has a linear time - dependence .",
    "the parameters of the pulse were optimized to achieve a total transfer of population under adiabatic following conditions @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that a significant improvement of the photoassociation rate compared to cw excitation can be obtained , since during the pulse the resonance condition is fulfilled for several vibrational levels @xmath7 .",
    "however , the quantity which must be improved is the formation rate of ground state molecules rather than the photoassociation rate .",
    "one advantage of excitation with chirped pulses is that the chirp parameter can be chosen to modify the shape of the vibrational wave packet formed in the potential @xmath5 .",
    "this may improve the efficiency of the stabilization step , and thus the formation rate of ground state molecules .",
    "the aim of the present work is therefore to suggest a two - color experiment using short laser pulses and to investigate how efficiently a second pulse can transfer the population to the bound vibrational levels of the ground state .",
    "starting from the vibrational wave packet formed in the excited state by photoassociation , we introduce a second pulse which is delayed in time from the first pulse .",
    "the time delay is chosen such that the wave packet has reached the vicinity of the inner turning point , where a vertical radiative transition to the ground state is expected to be efficient .",
    "the parameters of the second pulse , as well as the time delay between the two pulses are varied to improve the efficiency of the transfer , with two different goals : to either maximize the total population transfer , or to selectively populate one vibrational level .",

    "in contrast , for a positive chirp the lower levels are populated first , @xmath77 , and a spreading of the vibrational wave packet is expected . *",
    "several authors in the past have suggested ways of designing laser fields for the generation of spatially squeezed molecular wave packets @xcite .",
    "since they considered low vibrational levels , a numerical optimization procedure appeared to be necessary .",
    "here , we are dealing with long range molecules , where the motion is controlled by the asymptotic potential , and the availability of scaling laws makes the optimization easier , as for atomic rydberg wave packets @xcite .",
    "* we should note that in the chosen example , the vibrational progression and the scaling law of the vibrational period are slightly perturbed due to a tunneling effect for the levels in the vicinity of @xmath58=96 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a focussing time @xmath74=@xmath78 + 135 ps , slightly different from @xmath79 = 125 ps .",
    "moreover , the early population of levels which are perturbed by tunneling leads to population transfer to the inner well of the @xmath8 excited potential .",
    "this tunneling effect is not a general phenomenon , but very specific to the cesium @xmath80 molecular curve , and to the value chosen for the detuning .",
    "a detailed investigation would require consideration of two coupled channels in the region of the inner potential @xcite , beyond the scope of this work .    in the present calculations , we start from the wave packet in the excited state and investigate how the population can efficiently be transferred to vibrational levels of the ground state by the second pulse . as in our previous work ,",
    "this is achieved by studying the wave packet dynamics by numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( cf .",

    "the variation of the photoassociation probability as reported in the last column of table  [ tab : pump ] will be reconsidered in the conclusion .",
    "we first compute the franck - condon overlap matrix elements @xmath85 of the excited state wave packet with the bound ground state eigenfunctions ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , right ) .",
    "the results markedly depend upon @xmath83 , and so does the probability to form stable molecules . for instance , just after the photoassociation pulse , at time @xmath78 + 40 ps @xmath86 ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , right ) , the franck - condon overlap factors are negligible for most bound levels of the ground state , except for the last level @xmath87 which is very loosely bound ( 5 @xmath88 10@xmath89 @xmath0  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , half a vibrational period later , at time @xmath90135  ps when the wave packet has moved to the inner turning point ( diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , right ) , a significant overlap is obtained with various deeply bound levels of the ground state , in particular with @xmath91 14 , 20 .",
    "( b ) between the time - dependent wave packet in the excited state and all bound vibrational levels of the ground state .",
    "@xmath78 corresponds to @xmath92 .",
    "it is clear that the overlap with deeply bound ground state levels ( around @xmath93=14 ) is maximum when focussing of the excited state wave packet occurs , 135  ps or half a vibrational period after @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast , when the wave packet is at its outer turning point just after the pa pulse and again at about @xmath90250  ps ( one vibrational period @xmath73 ) , the overlap with only the last bound levels is significant .",
    "moreover , tunneling to and trapping of population in the inner potential well lead to overlap with ground state levels around @xmath94 : this is specific to the cesium @xmath95 state and to the value chosen for the detuning .",
    "note the stability of this population during half a vibrational period . ]",
    "the large overlap with @xmath96 can be explained by the coincidence of the inner classical turning point of the level @xmath58=92 and the outer turning point of @xmath93=14 , such that @xmath58=92 @xmath97 @xmath93=14 is a franck - condon transition .",
    "this large value is restricted to a short ( @xmath98  ps ) time window around @xmath99  ps as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemenew ] , where the time - dependence of the franck - condon overlap is shown . note that the overlap with @xmath94 is due to population in the inner well of @xmath5 due to tunneling  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : schemenew ] , we can indeed see that this population remains trapped at the considered timescale .",
    "the above mentioned large overlap with the last vibrational level of the ground state just after the photoassociation pulse ( @xmath100 ) is seen to reappear after one vibrational period , when the wave packet reaches again the outer turning point .",
    "however , we will not choose one of the last bound levels of the ground state as our target vibrational level @xmath93 , since a significant population is already achieved in a one - color experiment  @xcite , making the implementation of a two - color scheme superfluous .",
    "in fact , the specific advantage of a pump - dump experiment is the possibility of stabilization into deeply bound levels in the ground state .",
    "we will therefore focus on populating the level @xmath101 with binding energy @xmath102",
    "@xmath0 , and we will consider a second ( or dump ) pulse @xmath103 with parameters adapted to efficient population transfer toward @xmath101 , in particular with a time delay close to 135 ps .      for the dump pulse @xmath104 , we define a central frequency @xmath105 , a maximum intensity @xmath17 , a duration ( fwhme ) of the transform - limited pulse @xmath106 , the time of maximum amplitude @xmath107 , and a stretching factor @xmath108 characterizing the strength of the chirp .",
    "the choice of the second color is dictated by the choice of the target levels .",
    "for @xmath109 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , right ) , we have chosen a central frequency @xmath110  @xmath0 , which is resonant with @xmath111 for a binding energy of the excited state wave packet equal to 2.1 @xmath0 .",
    "this binding energy , computed as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the kinetic energy operator , stays time - independent once the photoassociation pulse is over .",
    "it is found 0.5 @xmath0 smaller than the binding energy of the level @xmath114 which is resonant with the central frequency of the pump pulse .",
    "this difference reflects the non - symmetric population of the @xmath7 levels relative to @xmath22 , the photoassociation process being much more efficient for the upper levels .",
    "the spectral width of the second pulse @xmath115 is limited by the requirement that mostly bound levels should be populated in the ground state .",
    "since @xmath93=14 is bound by 113 @xmath0 , the energy spread of the vibrational wave packet in the excited state can be neglected and the maximum spectral width is estimated as 2@xmath88113  @xmath0 . therefore , for short pulses @xmath104 ( fwhme @xmath116  fs ) , population transfer to the continuum is to be expected leading to the formation of pairs of `` hot '' atoms .",
    "this conclusion relies on overlap integrals and needs to be corrected by the possible energy dependence of the transition dipole moment @xmath117 . finally , if we wish to selectively excite the level @xmath101 , the spectral width is limited by the vibrational energy splitting around @xmath101 which is about 7  @xmath0 .",
    "the typical pulse temporal width @xmath118 of the dump pulse should therefore be larger than 2 ps .",
    "in the following , we will discuss two schemes to form ground state molecules :    1 .   for short pulses in the 10 - 300 fs range , important population transfer to several bound levels of the ground electronic state can be obtained ( cf .",
    "sec.[sec : many ] ) .",
    "the goal is then to maximize the total population transfer",
    ". the intensity , duration and possibly stretching factor , i.e. chirp , of the @xmath119 pulses will be systematically varied .",
    "2 .   for longer pulses in the picosecond domain ,",
    "transfer of population to a single vibrational level , namely @xmath93=14 , is possible ( see sec.[sec : single ] ) .",
    "the goal is then to optimize selective population transfer to a chosen level .",
    "the third parameter is the time - delay between the two pulses , defined as @xmath120 .",
    "the discussion can be guided by the following arguments , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : probability ] :    , @xmath121 .",
    "( bottom ) the upper limit to the probability of forming bound molecules is given by the sum over franck - condon overlap matrix elements between the time - dependent excited state wave packet ( assumed normalized to one ) and all the bound levels of the ground state .",
    "the highest probability of about 20% is expected for the focussed wave packet ( at time @xmath122  ps ) . ]    * first , we can use a simple model for the choice of the time delay @xmath123 . considering the wave packet @xmath124 , it is possible to estimate an upper limit to the probability of forming molecules from the sum over the franck - condon overlap matrix elements @xmath125 . after a short and weak dump pulse at time @xmath107 ,",
    "the wave packet created in the ground state is estimated by @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes jointly the sum over bound levels with eigenenergies @xmath128 and the integral over continuum states with energy @xmath129 , while @xmath130 is the fourier transform of the field @xmath131 and @xmath3 the dipole moment , assumed to be @xmath132independent .",
    "( [ eq : psig_perturb ] ) implies that vibrational levels and continuum states which are resonant within the bandwidth @xmath133 of the pulse are excited .",
    "the population transfer is proportional to the time - dependent franck - condon factors discussed above . assuming a @xmath134-pulse ( i.e. a pulse which leads to population inversion ) with bandwidth covering all ground state vibrational levels , the maximum probability is given by @xmath135 , restricting the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psig_perturb ] ) to the bound levels .",
    "the highest probability , 0.2 , is expected for a delay of 135 ps ( cf .",
    "[ fig : probability ] ) , when the wave packet @xmath136 is focussed after half a vibrational period .",
    "note the relatively short time window in which the probability is maximum .",
    "a secondary maximum is visible after one vibrational period ( 250 to 300 ps ) when the last levels are populated : much less population can then be transferred .",
    "note also the revival at @xmath137  ps , after one and a half vibrational period , with a larger width .",
    "the advantage of focussing is further manifested by comparing to the franck - condon overlaps of wave packets created by the pump pulses @xmath138 and @xmath121 .",
    "the maximum probability is now less than 10% , instead of 20% for the focussed wave packet , and it is spread during a larger time window . * next , we report time - dependent calculations for various dump pulses where the field is treated non - perturbatively and we start from a focussed wave packet . intensity and spectral width are varied ( see below sec .",

    "when the aim is to transfer as much population to the ground state as possible , the discussion of the pulse parameters is inspired by the arguments on population inversion in molecular electronic states developed in refs . @xcite .",

    "a vertical transition toward the level @xmath93=14 , bound by 113 @xmath0 , is even possible , since the outer turning point of the corresponding wave function coincides with @xmath184 .",
    "we therefore have discussed how population can efficiently be transferred to the ground triplet state by a short dump pulse which should be in the femto- or picosecond domain and optimally delayed from the pump pulse by @xmath183 .",

    "the best localization of the wave packet at the inner barrier is brought about by negatively chirping the pump pulse .",
    "there is yet another advantage when using a negative chirp of the pump pulse : the photoassociation probability is increased by a factor of 8 as compared to a transform - limited pulse .",
    "furthermore , the probability of creating bound molecules by the dump pulse is enhanced by roughly a factor of 3 for a negatively chirped pump pulse as compared to positively chirped or transform - limited ones .",
    "the number of stable molecules formed in a pump - dump sequence can be therefore be increased by 24 when appropriately choosing the pulse parameters .",
    "we have also considered a pump pulse with smaller detuning , for which the photoassociation probability is larger . however , due to a decrease of the franck - condon overlap , even for the maximally focussed wave packet , the stabilization step is much less efficient .",
    "therefore , the total number of stable molecules is roughly the same as in the previous case .",
    "finally , we have employed longer dump pulses with a duration of about 3 ps to selectively populate the @xmath93=14 level in the ground state . up to 12% of the photoassociated molecules",

    "<S> we show that a large number of deeply bound molecules are created in the ground triplet state . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss ( i ) broad - bandwidth dump pulses which maximize the probability to form molecules while creating a broad vibrational distribution as well as ( ii ) narrow - bandwidth pulses populating a single vibrational ground state level , bound by 113 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the use of chirped pulses makes the two - color scheme robust , simple and efficient . </S>"
