    "nuclear medium effects in the deep inelastic scattering processes have been widely discussed after the measurement and comparison of iron and deuterium electromagnetic structure functions @xmath2 by the european muon collaboration at cern using charged lepton beams  @xcite .",
    "thereafter studies , both theoretical as well as experimental , have been made in several nuclei .",
    "presently most of the information on nuclear medium effects comes from the charged lepton scattering data .",
    "the weak structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 have also been measured using neutrino ( antineutrino ) beams  @xcite .",
    "more experiments are planned to obtain data in the deep inelastic region using neutrino / antineutrino beams that will complement the information obtained from the charged lepton scattering .",
    "the nuclear effects for the weak structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 may be in general different",
    ". moreover , the nuclear correction for the weak structure function @xmath4 may be different from that of the electromagnetic structure function @xmath6 .",
    "the precise measurement of deep inelastic scattering @xmath7 cross section is also important in providing global fits of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and due to the fact that most of the @xmath7 experiments are being performed with nuclear targets , the nuclear effects should be properly accounted for before extracting the free nucleon parton distribution function . in the determination of electroweak parameters , a good knowledge of the nuclear medium effects is required .",
    "furthermore , with the confirmation of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis in the atmospheric as well as accelerator based experiments , the target is to determine precisely the parameters of the neutrino mass mixing matrix ( pmns matrix ) , particularly to get some information on mixing angle @xmath8 and cp - violating phase @xmath9 , using long baseline neutrino experiments and getting neutrinos from factories as well as @xmath10-beam sources  @xcite .",
    "most of these experiments are in the few gev energy region .",
    "these high intensity neutrino sources are aimed to reduce the statistical uncertainties .",
    "recently more efforts have been made to understand the systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "this is because in the region of a few gev , which is sensitive to the determination of the parameters of pmns matrix , the cross sections have not been very well measured . due to this reason various experiments are going on or have been proposed and lots of theoretical studies have been recently made for understanding the nuclear medium effects .",
    "these theoretical studies are mainly done for the quasielastic and one pion production processes , and recently some work on the two pion production , nucleon knock out reaction , hyperon production and single kaon production has been performed . in the case of deep inelastic scattering process induced by weak interaction , there are very few calculations where the dynamical origin of the nuclear medium effects has been studied  @xcite . in some theoretical analysis , nuclear medium effects have been phenomenologically described in terms of a few parameters which are determined from fitting the experimental data of charged leptons and ( anti)neutrino deep inelastic scattering from various nuclear targets  @xcite .",
    "miner@xmath11a  @xcite is taking data using neutrinos from numi lab . , and their aim is to perform cross section measurement in the neutrino energy region of 1 - 20 gev and with various nuclear targets like carbon , iron and lead .",
    "this will experimentally complement the present theoretical understanding of nuclear medium effects .",
    "nusong experiment  @xcite has been proposed at fermi lab to study the structure functions in the deep inelastic region using neutrino sources .",
    "nutev collaboration  @xcite has reported the results on weak charged and neutral current induced ( anti)neutrino processes on an iron target in the deep inelastic region .",
    "nomad  @xcite is doing data analysis of their experimental results and very soon going to report the results for the structure functions and cross sections in carbon target using neutrino beam .    in this paper , we study nuclear medium effects on the structure functions @xmath12(@xmath13,@xmath14 ) and @xmath15(@xmath13,@xmath14 ) in iron and carbon nuclear targets .",
    "we use a relativistic nucleon spectral function  @xcite to describe the momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus and define everything within a field theoretical approach where nucleon propagators are written in terms of this spectral function",
    ". the spectral function has been calculated using the lehmann s representation for the relativistic nucleon propagator and nuclear many body theory is used for calculating it for an interacting fermi sea in nuclear matter .",
    "a local density approximation is then applied to translate these results to finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we have assumed the callan - gross relationship for nuclear structure functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the contributions of the pion and rho meson clouds are taken into account in a many body field theoretical approach which is based on refs .",

    "recently , we have applied the present formalism to study nuclear effects in the electromagnetic structure function @xmath18 in nuclei in the deep inelastic lepton nucleus scattering  @xcite , and found that the numerical results agree with recent jlab results where the data for the ratios @xmath19 have been obtained  @xcite and also to the some of the earlier experiments performed with the heavier nuclear targets .",
    "motivated by the success of the present formalism  @xcite , in this paper , we have studied the nuclear medium effects in weak structure functions @xmath12(@xmath13,@xmath14 ) and @xmath15(@xmath13,@xmath14 ) and compared our results with the experimental results of nutev and cdhsw .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained the ratio of the structure functions @xmath20  ( i=2,3 ) to see how they do compare with the ratio obtained earlier for the electromagnetic structure function . using these @xmath12(@xmath13,@xmath14 ) and",

    "we find that a 20@xmath143 variation in @xmath90 s , results in a change of 4 - 6@xmath143 in the cross section at low x which decreases to 2 - 3@xmath143 around x=0.4 - 0.5 and after that it dies out .",
    "to observe the effect of non - isoscalarity , we have also studied ( not shown ) isoscalarity vs non - isoscalarity corrections and found that the non - isoscalar correction is around 2 - 3@xmath143 .",
    "figs.([neutrinocarbon20gev ] ) and ( [ neutrinocarbon60gev ] ) are the results for @xmath151 in @xmath137c induced by neutrinos at @xmath152=20 gev and 60 gev respectively and figs.([antineutrinocarbon20gev ] ) and ( [ antineutrinocarbon60gev ] ) are the corresponding results in @xmath137c induced by antineutrinos",
    ". the results in carbon will be useful in the analysis of data by the nomad  @xcite collaboration as well as the proposed nusong @xcite .",
    "nomad  @xcite experiment is primarily meant to measure the neutrino / antineutrino cross sections with better precision and constrain the nuclear models .",
    "therefore , our study of the nuclear medium effects would be a good test when the data will be available .",
    "to summarize our results , we have studied nuclear effects in the structure functions @xmath155 and @xmath156 in the carbon and iron nuclei using a many body theory to describe the spectral function of the nucleon in the nuclear medium for all @xmath14 .",
    "local density approximation has been used to apply the results for the finite nuclei .",
    "the use of spectral function is to incorporate fermi motion and binding effects .",
    "we have used cteq  @xcite pdfs in the numerical evaluation .",
    "target mass correction ( tmc ) has been considered .",
    "we have taken the effects of mesonic degrees of freedom , shadowing , anti - shadowing in the calculation of @xmath157 and shadowing and anti - shadowing effects in the calculation of @xmath158 .",
    "we have found that the mesonic cloud ( basically pion ) gives an important contribution to the cross section .",
    "these numerical results have been compared with the experimental observations of cdhsw  @xcite and nutev  @xcite collaborations . using these structure functions we obtained differential scattering cross section for iron and carbon nuclei and",
    "compared the results in iron from the experimentally observed values obtained by cdhsw  @xcite and nutev  @xcite collaborations .",
    "we also find that the effect of nuclear medium is also quite important even in the case of deep inelastic scattering and the ratio of the structure functions in nuclei to deuteron or free nucleon is different in @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
