    "figure [ fig : ponpicture ] illustrates the main components of a passive optical network ( pon ) . optical network units ( onus ) are situated in or close to user premises .",
    "an onu might be dedicated to an individual user or , when fiber is terminated at the curb or at the building , it could concentrate the traffic of several users .",
    "the onus are controlled from an optical line termination ( olt ) equipment that realizes the interface with the wide area network .",
    "passive splitters are used to broadcast downstream optical signals to the onus and to merge upstream signals destined to the olt .    to increase the capacity of a pon",
    ", it is proposed to employ wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) to multiply the capacity of the physical fibre .",
    "typically the onus will not be equipped to use all wavelengths simultaneously . in this paper",
    "we assume an onu has one or more transmitters that can be tuned to any wavelength .",
    "the spectrum is thus shared efficiently but the capacity of an onu is limited by its quota of tunable transmitters .    the major pon design concern is the dynamic bandwidth allocation ( dba ) algorithm implemented by the olt to arbitrate use of upstream capacity and to avoid collisions .",
    "there are two pon standards , epon from ieee and gpon from itu , that differ in the way they manage resource sharing .",
    "epon relies on asynchronous transmission of ethernet packets while gpon implements a synchronous 125@xmath0s frame enabling both circuit and packet switching .",
    "we develop generic models for packet based services that are applicable for both standards .",
    "the focus of the paper is on traffic capacity , the limit on demand beyond which some onu queues would always be saturated .",
    "this is arguably the most critical performance for the pon whose very high bit rate ensures delays are tiny at normal loads and only become significant as demand attains the capacity limit ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume the olt manages a single queue per user , receiving queue size _",
    "reports _ from the onus and attributing corresponding _ grants _ for upstream transmission .",
    "a grant is the time interval during which a user may transmit .",
    "we maintain that such simple management at pon level ( i.e. , no accounting for intra - onu class of service differentiation at the olt ) is highly desirable to limit complexity and generally meets user requirements , the olt ensures users receive a fair share of bandwidth , the onus realize what service differentiation is needed within that share by choosing which packets to send to fulfill the allocated grants .",
    "the notion of fair allocation naturally leads to a form of polling .",
    "for epon we define a dba that realizes a classical polling system with a particular interpretation for the switchover time between queues .",
    "the same model can be applied to one possible dba implementation for gpon .",
    "a second considered gpon dba , on the other hand , is more naturally modelled as a head of line processor sharing system .",
    "see below for more detail .",
    "the underlying polling systems are complicated by the fact that onu capacity is limited by the number of tunable transmitters they have , i.e. , the number of servers that can be present simultaneously at an onu . in particular , stability conditions of multiserver polling systems with limited - gated policies appear intractable in general .

    "mean field limits of polling systems _ : to overcome the complexity of the polling systems associated with these networks , the main contribution of the paper consists in the analysis of a large system limit where both the number of onus and the number of wavelengths grow indefinitely together .",
    "this scaling , also called _",
    "mean field limit _ , provides explicit formulas and simple numerical algorithms to derive useful approximations for realistically sized pons .",
    "it is based on the fact that , when the approximation holds , the onus become statically independent in the limit , their interaction being represented through a deterministic equation .",
    "see  @xcite for a general presentation of these methods .",
    "mean field limits have been used for some time now in queueing theory notably to study circuit switched networks , see  @xcite for example .",
    "in section  [ sec : pon ] we outline our proposed dbas for epon and gpon .",
    "we then recall relevant multiserver polling system results and discuss the difficulty of an exact analysis of the wdm pon .",
    "the large system asymptotic is developed in section  [ sec : largesystem ] where practically useful traffic capacity results are derived using the mean field assumption .",
    "this property is proved for a particular network configuration in section  [ sec : convergence ] .",
    "the validity of this assumption is tested , in penultimate section  [ sec : evaluate ] and used to evaluate the impact of switch overhead on pon traffic capacity .",
    "section  [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "the dbas we consider for both epon and gpon relate to a single , classless queue per user .",
    "the objective is to ensure low latency by imposing grant limits per visit and to ensure users receive adequate throughput by controlling fairness .",
    "the epon dba is governed by the multi - point control protocol ( mpcp ) based on the exchange of report and gate messages between olt and onus , as specified in ieee 802.3ah .",
    "an extension to wdm is proposed by mcgarry  @xcite .",
    "onus report current contents of their user queues via report messages while gate messages are sent downstream by the olt to allocate grants for each queue . in  @xcite , we proposed a novel dba where the olt precisely times the sending of gate messages and the upstream return of data packets and reports to maximize traffic capacity .",
    "the timing is designed to compensate for differences in propagation times and to avoid wasting capacity when propagation times are large .",
    "the epon behaves then like a polling system .",
    "the onus are `` visited '' by each wavelength following a certain schedule .",
    "the visit enables the transmission of upstream data and a report .",
    "the grants account for maximum per queue quotas .",
    "each visit incurs a switch overhead time equal to the time needed to send the report plus a physical layer guard time .",
    "the overhead is around 2@xmath0s for a 1gb / s epon @xcite .",
    "the olt is aware of all allocations and readily implements constraints on the number of simultaneous transmissions an onu can sustain .",
    "the gpon standards define a particular framework for dba that allows resource sharing between several communication services ( see the g.984 series of itu recommendations ) .",
    "we consider only the packet switched service .",
    "ethernet packets are transmitted within gpon transmission convergence ( gtc ) layer frames of 125@xmath0s fixed duration .",
    "downstream gtc frames are also used to convey grants from olt to onu users and reports on queue contents are included in upstream gtc frames from onu to olt .",
    "grants in a downstream gtc frame attribute transmission time slots in a precise upstream gct frame occurring after a fixed time offset .",
    "the offset is calculated to allow all onus to fulfill their grants accounting for processing time and propagation delays .",
    "it is possible to design a dba in this framework that emulates a polling system .",
    "wavelength capacity is allocated sequentially to onus for data transmission , or just for reporting if the queues are currently empty .",
    "overhead is incurred on switching from one onu to the next , as for the epon . however , this overhead is rather small according to the gpon specification , accounting for only some 100@xmath1s @xcite .",
    "an additional fixed overhead is incurred at the start of each frame .",
    "the gpon dba might alternatively consist in providing every onu queue a share of every upstream gtc frame on one or several wavelengths .",
    "the olt would calculate an allocation for each queue and a schedule of transmissions based on previously received reports and accounting for onu transmission capacity . in this way",
    ", there is a fixed overhead per frame , accounting for reports and physical constraints , to be subtracted from the overall capacity .",
    "the remaining capacity would be shared between users according to some fairness policy .",
    "we introduce notation and discuss known polling system results that can be used to analyse wdm pons .      in the following wavelengths",
    "are identified with servers circulating among onus .",
    "the polling system has @xmath2 onus and @xmath3 wavelengths .",
    "onu @xmath4 is equipped with @xmath5 tunable transmitters and manages @xmath6 independent user queues , i.e. , @xmath5 servers can be present at onu  @xmath4 simultaneously . when the dba emulates a polling system , the @xmath7 queue of onu @xmath4 , queue @xmath8 , has a maximum grant of @xmath9 seconds per visit by any wavelength .",
    "this mechanism is known as the limited - gated service policy . finally , @xmath10 is the switch overhead time associated with onu @xmath4 .",
    "we make no assumptions about the traffic in the user queues except that the packet arrival process is stationary and has a well defined rate .",
    "the traffic intensity of queue @xmath8 is @xmath11 expressed in units of the bit rate of one wavelength .",
    "we define @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    a wavelength is assumed to visit onus in a fixed cyclic order , assumed different for each wavelength",
    ". for _ periodic _ polling , visits to onus occur according to a deterministic schedule . a wavelength that should visit an onu with no free transmitter",
    "is assumed to skip directly to the next onu in the schedule .",
    "alternatively , for _ random _ polling , the next onu to visit is chosen at random from the onus that currently have a free transmitter .      in this section",
    "we assume @xmath14 for all @xmath4  an onu can be served by an arbitrary number @xmath15 of servers with a limited - gated policy .",
    "polling is either periodic or random .",
    "[ prop : multiserver ] all queues in all onus are stable if and only if , for all @xmath16 , @xmath17    when not all queues satisfy ( [ eq : multistable ] ) , there is a subset @xmath18 whose members are saturated while , for @xmath19 , we have @xmath20    condition ( [ eq : multistable ] ) derives from theorem 3 in @xcite or theorem 2.4 in @xcite with appropriate changes in notation .",
    "relaxed conditions in ( [ eq : multiunstable ] ) are deduced from the discussion in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "in fact , the results of @xcite and @xcite must be modified slightly since grant limits here apply to transmission time and not packets but this is straightforward .",
    "we later require the following additional result .    when the system is stable , the mean time @xmath21 between successive visits of wavelengths to any given onu is @xmath22",
    ".    the result may be deduced for periodic polling from section 3 in @xcite .",
    "the following alternative proof is valid also for random polling .",
    "since the system is stable , the mean number of wavelengths transmitting data is @xmath23 .",
    "thus @xmath24 is the mean number of wavelengths currently busy due to switch overhead .",
    "the fraction of time a server at onu @xmath4 experiences a switch overhead is @xmath25 .",
    "the relation for @xmath21 is obtained by summing up these quantities .",
    "the capacity of a multiserver polling system with server limits but unlimited gated service with periodic or random polling is given by the following .",
    "[ prop : tunable ] when the wdm epon with tunable transmitters has unlimited gated service , it is stable if @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the conditions are clearly necessary since otherwise at least one user queue would be unstable .",
    "to prove sufficiency , we use fluid limit arguments as in @xcite . starting from any initial conditions , it is necessary to prove that the overall fluid content denoted @xmath29 decreases with time .",
    "let @xmath30 designate the number of onu queues that have a fluid backlog at @xmath31 . if @xmath32 , all the service capacity is devoted to fluid queues and @xmath33 by the second condition .",
    "if @xmath34 , all queues in @xmath30 will be served at their maximum rate .",
    "we have , therefore , @xmath35 .",
    "combining server limits and grant limits leads to a system whose traffic capacity turns out to be intractable , even for a simple toy example with 3 onus with a single queue , 2 wavelengths and no switch overhead @xcite .",
    "this motivates the large system approximations discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we derive the traffic capacity of a wdm pon with tunable transmitters under the assumption that a mean field limit is valid in large systems .      as a preliminary ,",
    "consider the polling system representing a wdm pon under the assumption that overhead ( for switching between onus ) is negligibly small .",
    "assume the onus are each equipped with one tunable transmitter .",
    "let the number of active onus at time @xmath31 be @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath36 is the number of onus with at least one backlogged queue .",
    "when @xmath37 , every onu is served by one wavelength .",
    "if @xmath38 , on the other hand , the pon shares the capacity of the @xmath3 wavelengths according to the dba algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig : sharing ] illustrates the importance of the value of @xmath3 . in the top figure ,",
    "@xmath39 and , depending on the onu loads , it is a frequent occurrence that @xmath38 .",
    "onus then share capacity dynamically and it is not easy to predict pon performance . in the lower figure , @xmath40 and the fluctuations of @xmath36 have relatively lower amplitude . in the depicted realization ,",
    "every pon is always able to use its tunable transmitter whenever it is active .    as @xmath3 and @xmath2 increase indefinitely ,",
    "it is intuitively clear that the fluctuations of @xmath36 become small compared to @xmath3 .",
    "each onu then behaves like an independent polling system with the server capacity of one wavelength .",
    "every onu queue is stable if @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this intuition is confirmed by the propositions of section  [ sec : convergence ] in the case where onus have a single queue , service is limited to one packet per cycle , packet arrivals are poisson and packet sizes exponential .",
    "a more general proof is , for the moment , out of reach .",
    "we nevertheless proceed in this and the next sections with the reasonable assumption that a `` mean field '' asymptotic is valid as @xmath3 and @xmath2 both tend to infinity .",
    "it is clear that the above capacity limits can be generalized to onus equipped with a variable number of tunable transmitters . in a large system , each onu always has access to its quota of wavelengths whenever it is active .",
    "the traffic capacity of onu @xmath4 is thus that of a @xmath5-server polling system : queues are stable if @xmath26 for @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "we now suppose switch overheads are non - negligible : each visit to onu @xmath4 consumes @xmath10 seconds of wavelength capacity .",
    "again , first assume each onu is equipped with just one tunable transmitter .",
    "figure [ fig : occupation ] shows how wavelengths are fully used in a wdm pon .",
    "each wavelength is either transmitting data or is unavailable because of the switch overhead . when @xmath45 , the visit frequency to inactive onus is such that residual capacity @xmath46 is entirely consumed by overhead .",
    "figure [ fig : multipon ] illustrates the upstream activity of an onu .",
    "this onu has 3 queues that are served cyclically respecting maximum grant limits on each visit . in the figure ,",
    "queue 3 happens to be empty in cycle @xmath47 .",
    "each set of grants terminates with the switch overhead .",
    "after the overhead , the wavelength visits another free onu ( possibly this one again ) and the considered onu sees a vacation time ( @xmath48 ) before it is again visited by a wavelength .",
    "when the system is stable , at equilibrium the vacation time of onu @xmath4 , i.e. , the time when no server is present , is denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "note that this random variable depends _ a priori _ on the activity of all onus . under the mean field assumption below",
    ", this dependence vanishes in the large system limit where @xmath2 and @xmath3 tend to infinity .",
    "let @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 be the switchover time at equilibrium over all onus .",
    "first , we derive a useful general relation .    at equilibrium , the mean vacation interval @xmath52 of a system with one tunable transmitter per onu satisfies @xmath53    at equilibrium , the number of onus that are not currently being served is constant and equal to @xmath54",
    ". consequently @xmath55 is the rate at which one of these onus receives the visit of a server .",
    "similarly , the expected number of wavelengths transmitting data must be equal to the offered traffic @xmath23 .",
    "the remainder , @xmath46 , is the mean number of servers in overhead period and consequently @xmath56 is the rate at which servers leave a switch overhead period .",
    "the identity of the proposition follows .    to exploit equation  ( [ eq : theta ] )",
    "we must make the following additional assumption .    _ mean field assumption _ we assume successive intervals @xmath57 are independent and identically distributed for all @xmath4 and all @xmath47 with mean @xmath52 .",
    "this means the local onu polling system with vacation depicted in figure [ fig : multipon ] can be analyzed as an independent system , the impact of the other onus being manifested through the value of the mean field parameter @xmath52 .",
    "we maintain this assumption is reasonable when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are large and when , for each wavelength , the choice of the next onu to visit is made uniformly at random among those that are eligible .",
    "the latter assumption applies for both random polling and periodic polling in the large system limit .",
    "this , roughly speaking , is because the past activity of any onu has negligible impact on future wavelength visits while available destinations for a wavelength s next visit hardly depend on its own history .",
    "the system is effectively memoryless and , indeed , we would further claim the distribution of the @xmath57 is exponential in the large system limit .",
    "this property is not used for the present capacity results .    to evaluate @xmath52 , note",
    "that , under the mean field assumption , the system represented in figure [ fig : multipon ] behaves like a classical single server periodic polling system with limited gated service and expected overhead per cycle equal to @xmath58 . by proposition [ prop : multiserver ] , its mean cycle time is @xmath59 .",
    "straightforward calculations show that the overall mean overhead @xmath51 defined above can then be expressed as @xmath60 eliminating @xmath51 in ( [ eq : theta ] ) and ( [ eq : delta ] ) yields an equation that can be solved for @xmath52 .",
    "when the @xmath10 are all equal ( to @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 is given directly by ( [ eq : theta ] ) .",
    "otherwise , we must resort to numerical evaluation .",
    "stability conditions result from those of the individual onu polling systems where the overhead and vacation are assimilated to the per cycle switch time .    under the mean field assumption ,",
    "the wdm pon with one tunable transmitter per onu , represented as a multiserver , limited - gated polling system where no more than one server can simultaneously attend any queue , is stable if @xmath61 where @xmath52 is derived from ( [ eq : theta ] ) and ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "the proof follows directly from proposition [ prop : multiserver ] on making the appropriate substitutions . when the overhead is the same for each onu we readily deduce the following .    when @xmath62 for all @xmath4 , every queue is stable if @xmath63      limited gated service is designed to limit the impact on onu performance when some users saturate their share of pon capacity .",
    "let the set of saturated queues be @xmath18 . to derive stability conditions for the other queues we must simply replace @xmath10 by @xmath64 in ( [ eq : delta ] ) to compute @xmath52 and substitute for @xmath10 and @xmath52 in ( [ eq : conditions ] ) .",
    "for a system with given traffic distribution , the following algorithm determines the set @xmath18 of saturated queues .    1 .",
    "@xmath65 , the empty set .",
    "2 .   find @xmath66 .",

    "5 .   repeat from step [ algoloop ] .      to simplify the presentation ,",
    "we have so far assumed each onu has exactly one tunable transmitter .",
    "however , the above results apply immediately with slight modification to a variable number of transmitters if we make the following assumption . the wavelengths on terminating one service visit an eligible onu with probability proportional to its number of free transmitters",
    "this would result in the large system limit if each wavelength had a fixed cycle of visits chosen as a random permutation of _",
    "transmitters_. in condition ( [ eq : conditions ] ) , it is necessary to replace 1 on the right hand side by @xmath5 .      in gpon , a possible dba is to divide the capacity available in a frame ( or several successive frames ) between onu queues , applying a max - min fair algorithm .",
    "the overhead per frame is fixed and equal to @xmath70 .",
    "the residual capacity would be shared by the olt between active onu queues .",
    "queue @xmath71 of onu @xmath4 would receive an allocation when active proportional to its weight @xmath72 .",
    "assume the frame duration @xmath73 and the @xmath10 tend to zero while the ratio @xmath74 remains equal to @xmath75 .",
    "the underlying service system is now weighted head of line processor sharing with a maximum service rate for onu @xmath4 equivalent to @xmath76 .",
    "the capacity of this system appears intractable in general @xcite . in the large system limit where the number of queues and the system capacity increase indefinitely , however , we intuitively expect the service rate constraint to apply to all onus ,",
    "i.e. , with high probability , every onu is served when busy at its maximum rate .",
    "the system in fact behaves as discussed in section  [ sec : nooverhead ] and the stability conditions are @xmath77",

    "we report results of a preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of the mean field approximation and quantify the impact of the switch overhead .      in the simulations , we consider a realistic pon configuration where each wavelength provides an upstream transmission bit rate of 1 gbps .",
    "we assume that onus have a single queue with infinite capacity and one tunable transmitter .",
    "users send fixed size 1000 byte packets according to a poisson process .",
    "the grant size is fixed to @xmath137 @xmath138 ( transmission time of one packet ) and switch overhead is set to 1.2 @xmath138 ( 15% of the grant size ) .",
    "figure [ fig : onus - switchover ] shows the proportion of wavelengths in switch overhead measured in 1ms intervals for @xmath139 and 500 , respectively .",
    "overall load is 0.2@xmath2 and @xmath140 .",
    "the figure shows that , as the number of onus increases , the fluctuations of this proportion decrease .",
    "the wavelength visit rate to a given onu , determined by this proportion , thus converges to a constant .",
    "this is why it is plausible that individual onus tend to become statistically independent .",
    "figure [ fig : stability - balanced ] depicts the capacity region of a pon with two classes of onus .",
    "each onu of the same class has the same load and there is an equal number of onus per class . @xmath141 .",
    "the region to the left and below the plots corresponds to loads for which the onu queues are stable .",
    "units are normalized loads with respect to the total number of onus .    figure [ fig : stability - balanced ] compares the capacity region determined by ( [ eq : samedelta ] ) with simulation results for @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the accuracy of the results is good for @xmath142 and excellent for @xmath143 .",
    "discrepancies for @xmath142 with unbalanced traffic are not surprising as the number of onus is then effectively only 3 .",
    "similar precision is observed in figure [ fig : stability - unbalanced ] where class 2 has three times as many onus as class 1 .",
    "note that pons are currently designed for around 100 onus so that the accuracy of the mean field approximation is largely sufficient .",
    "figure [ fig : stability - overhead ] illustrates the impact of the overhead as a percentage of the grant limit given by the mean field approximation . for these results ,",
    "@xmath144 and 40% of onus are in class 1 .",
    "the graphs show that the impact of overhead is significant .",
    "it is worthwhile increasing the grant size as long as the worst case latency remains sufficiently small .",
    "note that when some queues are overloaded , their grant is effectively added to the overhead seen by the other queues , as discussed in section  [ sec : localstability ] .",
    "the design of dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms for wdm pons brings challenging performance problems , even when we suppose the dba does not attempt to realize intra - onu service differentiation .",
    "the main performance criterion for these systems is the maximal traffic capacity they can achieve , delays being negligibly small until loads are very close to this capacity .",
    "the natural stochastic models to be investigated in this domain are multiserver polling models with both server limits and grant limits .",
    "they appear to be not tractable in general .",
    "for this reason , we have explored a large system approximation based on a mean field assumption . under this assumption ,",
    "the behaviour of a given onu can be described as an isolated queueing system independent of the other onus . the traffic capacity analysis for this limiting representation of",
    "the pon notably reveals the non - trivial impact of switch overhead .",
    "simulations reveal excellent accuracy even for systems much smaller than that of real pons .",
    "the mathematical justification of the mean field approximation has been provided in a simple case where switch times are null and traffic is markovian . in",
    "future work we aim to extend this analysis to the realistic case of general traffic and non - zero switch overhead .",
    "we also intend to use the results derived here to perform a more thorough analysis of dba performance for epon and gpon ."
