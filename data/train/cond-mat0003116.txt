    "the overdoped regime of yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 is accessible with heavy oxygen dopings close to @xmath16 = 7 .",
    "the crossover from the underdoped to the overdoped regimes occurs around @xmath17 = 6.92 , nearly coinciding with a displacive structural phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is suggesting to associate the structural instability close to optimum doping with a kind of barrier limiting @xmath18 .",
    "the 123 bi - layer cuprates exhibit comparatively low `` optimum '' @xmath18s around 90 k , but chemical trends and pressure experiments imply that @xmath18 is not yet at its optimum value . in this communication",
    "we discuss a mechanism being possibly responsible for the barrier limiting @xmath18 of yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 , and stabilizing the overdoped regime for @xmath12 .",
    "oxygen doping of the parent cuprate yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath19 induces two displacive structural phase transitions : the first at the insulator metal transition around @xmath20 transforming the tetragonal unit cell of the antiferromagnetic insulator into the orthorhombic symmetry of the metal , and the second close to optimum doping , @xmath21 , changing the orthorhombic unit cell from the @xmath3-ortho to the @xmath4-ortho type .      in the underdoped regime ( @xmath22 )",
    "doping is well established to increase the orthorhombicity , @xmath23 .",
    "positive axial strain , @xmath24 expands weakly the @xmath25-axis , while negative axial strain , @xmath26 compresses strongly the @xmath27-axis , cf .",
    "fig.1 ( _ left _ ) .",
    "the oppposite axial strains result in a _",
    "quadrupolar _ instability in the orthorhombic basal plane , labelled @xmath3-ortho .      in the overdoped regime ( @xmath28 )",
    "the @xmath25-axis strain changes its sign , hence doping shrinks both , @xmath27 and @xmath25 , resulting in a _ breathing _ instability of the orthorhombic basal plane , labelled @xmath4-ortho , cf .",
    "fig.1 ( _ right _ ) . since both , @xmath25- and @xmath27-axis strains , are negative in all samples , independent on their various routes of chemical preparation , the planar breathing instability has to be considered as a generic property of the overdoped regime .",
    "doping compresses strongly the @xmath29-axis , usually described by a straight throughout all regimes up to @xmath30 .",
    "samples synthezised in the absence of carbonate however were shown to exhibit a significant minimum in @xmath31 close to the onset of the overdoped regime @xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy and y - exafs confirm the @xmath29-axis anomaly also in other samples : the in - phase o2,o3 mode ( out - of - plane ) softens abruptly in the overdoped regime , while the static o2,3cu2 interlayer spacing ( `` dimple '' ) increases discontinously by @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the strong contraction of @xmath29 is nearly completely attributable to the compression of the cu2o1(apex ) bonds reflecting the charge transfer from the chains to the planes .",
    "the cu2 atoms may be seen to be pulled out the cuo@xmath5 planes .",
    "notably thereby the average y ",
    "o2,3 interlayer spacings remain unaffected .    doping across the underdoped ",
    "overdoped phase boundary continues compressing the cu2o1(apex ) bonds . in the overdoped regime",
    "however the average o2,3-layers experience a significant _ repulsion _ from the cu2-layers , strongly contrasting with the underdoped regime . in some samples",
    "o2,3 interlayer spacing remains nearly unaffected , and as a result @xmath31 develops a minimum @xcite .",
    "we have shown from y - exafs that the y ",
    "cu2 bond lengths are almost independent on doping @xcite . this suggests an `` umbrella mode '' to describe the static correlations between the cu2 out - of - plane , and the o2 , o3 in - plane displacements @xcite .",
    "a refinement of the `` umbrella mode '' model may also explain the @xmath3- and @xmath4-ortho deformations in the under- and overdoped regimes , respectively .",
    "the lengths of the rigid semicovalent in - plane copper - oxygen bonds can be safely assumed to be almost independent on doping , too . then collapsing the `` umbrella '' moves the planar oxygens o2,3 out of their planes . as schematically shown in fig.1 (",
    "_ left _ ) the _ quadrupolar _ @xmath3-ortho instability pushes the o3 atoms beyond , and the o2 atoms beneath their planes .",
    "these shifts in opposite directions along @xmath29 tend to cancel ( depending slightly on the orthorhombicity ) , and the plane dimpling is solely determined by the cu2 out - of - plane displacement . on the other hand side ( fig.1 , _ right _ ) the _ breathing _",
    "@xmath4-ortho instability pushes both , o2 and o3 atoms , beyond their planes , thus increasing the dimpling not only by the cu2 out - of - plane shift , but also by the oppositely directed o2,o3 out - of - plane shifts .",
    "out - of - plane displacements of the planar copper and oxygens were shown to have important effects on the electronic band structure near @xmath33 . in particular",
    "they determine the strengths and symmetries of the interlayer hoppings @xcite .",
    "remote hybridization of the @xmath34 cu@xmath35 orbitals with the @xmath34 cu@xmath7 o@xmath8 band provides interlayer hoppings with @xmath36-symmetry , exhibiting maxima at ( @xmath37,0 ) and ( 0,@xmath37 ) in @xmath38-space .",
    "the strength of the @xmath39 hybridization is mainly controlled by the length of cu2o1 ( apex ) bond .",
    "hybridizations of the the @xmath9 cu@xmath40o@xmath11 , cu@xmath41o@xmath11 with the @xmath6 cu@xmath7o@xmath8 bands become feasible through cu2 out - of - plane positions .",
    "once activated , @xmath9-@xmath6 hybridizations repell the o2,3 from the cu2 plane @xcite .",
    "we conclude , that the _ quadrupolar _ @xmath3-ortho instability ought to suppress hybridizations of the @xmath9 with the @xmath6 bands . the _ breathing _",
    "@xmath4-ortho instability however ought to favour them and to provide a possible mechanism relaxing the confinement of the carriers , thus pushing the system into the overdoped regime",
