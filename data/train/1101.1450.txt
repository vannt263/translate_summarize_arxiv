    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) belong to a class of objects called magnetars  neutron stars whose x - ray emission is likely to be powered by the decay of their extremely strong magnetic fields ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1996 ; thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni 2002 ) .",
    "all seven confirmed sgrs and six out of seven confirmed axps have emitted energetic bursts of x - rays / soft gamma rays .",
    "burst active episodes of magnetars last anywhere from few hours to months . during their bursting activity",
    ", magnetars also exhibit remarkable temporal and spectral changes in their persistent x - ray output .",
    "a detailed description of sgrs and axps can be found in woods & thompson ( 2006 ) and mereghetti ( 2008 ) .    in the last seven years ,",
    "new magnetar candidates have emerged , most prominently through transient outbursts ( e.g. , xte  j1810@xmath0197 , halpern & gotthelf 2005 ; cxo j164710.2 - 455216 , israel et al .",
    "2007 ; sgr j1833@xmath00832 , g et al .",
    "these sources were too dim to be detected in x - rays during their quiescent phases ( usually below our detection sensitivity ) , but their x - ray fluxes increased by up to few hundred times as they entered their outburst episodes .",
    "in addition , known magnetar sources also exhibit variations ( triggered by bursting activity ) in their persistent flux , although typically not as dramatic as those in the transient systems ( e.g. , woods et al .",
    "these high x - ray luminosities were instrumental in probing the outburst mechanism of magnetars ( zel & gver 2007 ; gver et al . 2007 ;",
    "in contrast , the low but persistent flux level of most magnetars requires long term ( 5 - 10 years ) monitoring to understand ( burst - induced ) changes in their emission properties ( dib , kaspi , & gavriil 2009 ) .",
    "sgr  1900 + 14  has been one of the most prolific sgrs : it was discovered in 1979 ( mazets , golenetskij & guryan 1979 ) , and was detected in a bursting mode again in 1992 ( kouveliotou et al . 1993 ) . in may 1998",
    "the source entered a major outburst episode that lasted about eight months and included the giant flare on 1998 august 27 ( hurley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "asca and rxte observations prior to and during the 1998 activation led to the discovery of its 5.16  s spin period ( hurley et al .",
    "1999 ) , its spin - down rate of @xmath110@xmath2 s / s and magnetic field of @xmath3  g ( kouveliotou et al . 1999 ) , and thus to the confirmation of its magnetar nature .",
    "the source resumed a high level of activity in april 2001 ( guidorzi et al .",
    "2001 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "2001 ) and again in march 2006 ( vetere et al .",
    "2006 ) . as its burst active phases",
    "are well separated from each other , sgr  1900 + 14  is an excellent source to investigate radiative changes both during bursting behavior as well as in burst quiescence .",
    "the first major enhancement in the persistent x - ray flux of sgr  1900 + 14  was observed at the onset of the 1998 august 27 giant flare : the flux increased by a factor of @xmath1700 with respect to its level before the activation ( woods et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis of the ( much longer ) flux decay period was not possible due to the lack of continuous monitoring observations with imaging instruments during the decay phase .",
    "esposito et al . ( 2007 ) analyzed nine pointed bepposax observations of sgr  1900 + 14  spanning about five years from may 1997 to april 2002 and noted that the ( 2@xmath010 kev ) flux measured in the last pointing faded significantly with respect to earlier observations . following the april 2001 activation , the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory and _ xmm - newton _  observed sgr  1900 + 14  at numerous occasions , establishing a valuable dataset for understanding the long term behavior of this source in , particular , and of magnetars , in general .    in this paper , we make use of all archival _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_observations to construct the persistent x - ray flux temporal and spectral history of sgr  1900 + 14  spanning about seven years following the april 2001 activation . in the next section",
    "we introduce the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations used in this study . in section 3 , we present the results of the spectral analysis and show that the magnetic field strength and the magnetospheric properties remain stable over the period spanned by the observations , while the surface temperature and the inferred emitting area both decline with time following both outbursts .",
    "we also show that the source flux shows the same trend in its decline from outburst in both episodes and ultimately reaches the same minimum flux in both cases .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results in section 4 .",
    "between 2001 april 22 and 2008 april 8 , sgr  1900 + 14  was observed 13 times with _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_. table [ tbl : obss ] lists the log of these pointed x - ray observations .",
    "we describe below the details of our data reduction",
    ".    9    .log of sgr  1900 + 14  observations [ tbl : obss ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we found that sgr  1900 + 14  exhibits a monotonic but non - steady flux decline following the x - ray brightening during its 2001 and 2006 outbursts . in both outbursts ,",
    "its flux dropped rapidly within a few weeks after the onset of the outburst and then at a slower rate for approximately 600  days .",
    "after this period , the flux declines again at a much faster rate .",
    "a similar decay trend was also seen in sgr  1627@xmath041 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "the fact that we observe the same trend in successive outbursts from the same source suggests that the long - term effects of outbursts are not stochastic but reproducible .",
    "it is clear that magnetar bursting activity leads to long - term flux enhancements and that the additional energy powering these enhancements is stored in the crust as heat .",
    "this heat comes most likely from the energy released in the crust during the bursts , or from the energy deposited in the crust by the bombardment with magnetospheric particles during the burst .",
    "the crust , then , reradiates this additional heat over a timescale of a few years .    despite the correlation between the flux and the surface temperature , the variation in the surface temperature alone does not account for the decline in the flux , but it also requires a change in the emitting area over time .",
    "this can perhaps be understood if the crust is heated inhomogeneously , as would be expected if the initial heating episode is due to magnetic energy release . moreover , because the thermal resistance of the crust is dominated by the uppermost layers , where the heat conductivity is strongly affected by the magnetic field , heat coming from the deeper layers of the crust could reach the surface unevenly .",
    "this leads to both uneven heating and uneven cooling , which may affect the total inferred emitting area .",
    "furthermore , over - time , because the observations are carried out in a limited energy range , cooler parts of the crust may fall out of the observed energy band faster than the hotter regions , again reducing the inferred emitting area .",
    "thus , the observed source flux would decline both due to a decline in temperature as @xmath4 and due to a decline in the emitting area .",
    "we find on three different occasions that the x - ray flux of sgr  1900 + 14  was as low as @xmath5  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath7 , suggesting that this level may correspond to the source persistent x - ray flux in the absence of burst induced enhancements .",
    "the current detection thresholds of imaging instruments are @xmath110@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 ; it is , therefore , possible that the persistent flux levels of the so - called transient magnetars are much lower than those of the always detectable magnetars .",
    "if that is indeed the case , the magnetar engine that is responsible for a source persistent quiescent x - ray emission would seem to power a broad flux range of @xmath9 to @xmath10  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath7 .    e.g. , t.g . , and f. .",
