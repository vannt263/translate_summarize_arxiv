    "the dirac equation considered as a dynamic equation for a wave function in frames of quantum mechanics principles has been investigated almost completely , and it is hardly possible to add anything new . at the same time the dirac equation considered as a dynamic equation for a distributed dynamic system @xmath12 displays a series of such unexpected properties as existence of dynamic variables @xmath4 responsible for quantum effects and appearance of a constant timelike vector describing a split of the space - time into the space and the time .    from mathematical point of view our investigation of the dirac equation",
    "is simply a change of variables , when the dirac four - component complex wave function is substituted by certain tensor variables having also eight independent real components .",
    "the tensor variables are : the 4-flux vector @xmath1 , @xmath13 , the spin pseudo - vector @xmath2 , @xmath13 , the action scalar @xmath14 , and a pseudo - scalar @xmath4 .",
    "these quantities will be referred to as hydrodynamic variables .    from physical standpoint",
    "the dynamic system @xmath12 is considered as a distributed dynamic system describing in some way an electron ( or positron ) motion .",
    "the motion of a single particle is supposed to be stochastic , the variables @xmath1 describing the mean 4-flux of particles .",
    "interpretation of other dynamic variables of @xmath12 is produced on the base of a comparison with a statistical ensemble of classical particles .",
    "the quantal correspondence principle , when a linear operator corresponds to any physical quantity , is not used .",
    "other quantum principles are not used also . instead of them",
    "one uses a more general statistical principle which asserts : _ a set _ @xmath15 ( statistical ensemble ) _ of many similar independent stochastic systems _",
    "@xmath16 _ is a deterministic dynamic system _ @xmath17 [ 1 ] .",
    "the term `` a stochastic system '' means that experiments with a single system are irreproducible , and there are no dynamic equations for such a system . if @xmath18 means either stochastic system @xmath16 , or a deterministic system @xmath17 , the statistical principle can be formulated in the form @xmath19\\quad \\text{is}\\quad \\mathcal{s}_{d}\\ ] ] the statistical principle can be applied both to quantum and classical systems . it is a more general statement , than the set of quantum principles . in particular",
    ", it can be valid for such stochastic systems which are neither quantum , nor classical .",
    "the main concept of this approach is the statistical ensemble considered as a dynamic system ( not a probability density , or a probability amplitude ) .",
    "this approach will be referred to as _ a statistical ensemble technique _ ( set ) .",
    "there is a reason for consideration of the dirac equation without usage of quantum principles , i.e. simply as a dynamic equation for the system @xmath0 .",
    "recently one suggested a hypothesis that the real space - time is a distorted minkowski space - time , and the distortion of the space - time is a reason for quantum effects [ 2 ] .",
    "distortion is such a deformation of the minkowski space - time which transform one - dimensional world lines into three - dimensional world tubes .",
    "the world tubes of particles appear stochastic , and their statistical description coincides with quantum description provided the planck constant @xmath20 determines the space - time distortion ( thickness of the tubes ) .",
    "this hypothesis was proved for a non - relativistic free particle .",
    "it is interesting to test the hypothesis in the case of a relativistic particle .",
    "for such a test it is necessary to separate the action describing the ensemble of dirac particles into two parts : a classical part and a part responsible for quantum effects .",
    "another motive is as follows .",
    "the conventional quantum dynamics technique ( qdt ) is an axiomatic construction .",
    "qdt relates to set approximately in the same way , as the axiomatic thermodynamics relates to the statistical physics .",
    "for instance , the brownian motion can not be explained and understood from standpoint of thermodynamics .",
    "thermodynamic axioms do not permit to do this .",
    "the statistical physics explains the brownian motion phenomenon and restricts an application of thermodynamic principles , because a statistical approach is more general , than the approach of the axiomatic thermodynamics .",
    "something like that one can see in the field of the quantum dynamics .",
    "problem of pair production is a principal problem of the high energy physics . in those areas , where the pair production is unessential and",
    "can be considered as a correction ( for instance , in quantum electrodynamics ) the quantum theory succeeds . in those areas , where pair production is a dominating effect , the quantum theory ( in particular , qft ) failed",
    ".    for last fifty years",
    "the quantum field theory has not succeeded in solving the problem of pair production .",
    "a suspicion arises that this failure is not accidental .",
    "maybe , the problem of pair production can not be solved in framework of the quantum principles , and a more general statistical approach is necessary .",
    "classical limit of the dirac equation is rather difficult to obtain , because it contains such non - classical quantities as dirac @xmath8-matrices , which hardly can be considered from the classical point of view .",
    "usually a quantum electron moving in a given electromagnetic field @xmath21 , @xmath22 is described by the dirac equation @xmath23where @xmath24 is a four - component complex wave function .",
    "the light speed @xmath25 is chosen to be equal to 1 .",
    "it is possible to transform the variables @xmath24 and to describe this system in terms of variables @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath4 , defined by the relations    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    here @xmath32 , @xmath22 are the dirac @xmath8-matrices satisfying the commutation relation    @xmath33    where @xmath34 = diag@xmath35 is the metric tensor",

    "thus , the scalar @xmath14 , pseudo - scalar @xmath4 , vector @xmath46 , and pseudo - vector @xmath36 have 8 real independent components which are used instead of 8 real components ( 4 complex components ) of the dirac wave function @xmath24 .",
    "realization of such a transformation is a goal of the present paper .",
    "such a description can be regarded as a description in terms of hydrodynamic variables . under some conditions the dynamic system @xmath12 turns into a statistical ensemble @xmath11 of classical dynamic systems @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 can be interpreted as a classical analog of the dirac electron .",
    "@xmath11 is described usually in terms of hydrodynamic variables @xmath46 , @xmath14 , @xmath47",
    ". the dynamic systems @xmath12 and @xmath11 are distinguished by some terms of their lagrangians , but not conceptually .",
    "thus , one can consider a dynamic distinction between the dirac dynamic system @xmath12 and the corresponding classical ensemble .    in the second section some properties of the statistical ensemble @xmath48",
    "are investigated .",
    "the third section is devoted to introduction of hydrodynamic variables . in the fourth section the action for the dirac equation",
    "is written in terms of hydrodynamic variables .",
    "the fifth section is devoted to consideration of quasi - uniform state of the system @xmath0 .",
    "relativistic invariance of dynamic equation in terms of hydrodynamic variables is discussed in the sixth section .",
    "the seventh section is devoted to investigation of the classical analog @xmath6 of the dirac electron .",
    "let there be a classical system @xmath18 described by the lagrangian function @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are generalized coordinates and velocities .",
    "then , by definition a pure statistical ensemble @xmath48 of systems @xmath18 is a set of similar independent systems @xmath18 .",

    "according to eq.(7.21 ) this distinction is proportional to the quantum constant @xmath20 .",
    "second , it is very difficult to understand , why the world line of a free particle is a helix spiralling round the straight line @xmath499even in an absence of the electromagnetic field .",
    "all this can be explained by means of the supposition that @xmath500 describes an observable part of a complicated bound system whose center of inertia @xmath501 moves according to eq.(8.1 ) in the case of @xmath502 and according to eq.(7.42 ) in the case of not too strong electromagnetic field .",

    "then @xmath503 can be considered as a ring .",
    "world lines of the ring particles form a two - dimensional world tube in the space - time .",
    "such a construction is more symmetric , than helically moving particle .",
    "besides such a ring does not radiate electromagnetic waves .",
    "the statistical ensemble @xmath234 can be considered as consisted of rings @xmath503 which are classical distributed dynamic systems .",
    "unfortunately , rings @xmath503 and their two - dimensional world tubes are incompatible with the concept of a pointlike particle",
    ".    one can try to associate the world tubes with the space - time properties ( but not with the structure of the dynamic system @xmath506 .",
    "in this case it is necessary to admit that the distortion of the space - time does not vanish , i.e. the characteristic geometric structures of the space - time are three - dimensional world - tubes ( but not straight lines ) [ 2,15 ] . then one can hope to remove incompatibility between the concept of a pointlike particle and the cylindrical space - time structures generated by the dirac equation .",
    "note that in the distorted space - time the momentum of a particle and its velocity are independent quantities which are connected by no algebraic relation .",
