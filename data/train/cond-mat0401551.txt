    "the view of the glass transition ( see @xcite for general reviews ) as a dynamical phenomenon emerges naturally from the real - space picture of supercooled liquids developed in @xcite .",
    "this work demonstrates that many of the properties of supercooled liquids can be simply explained by the existence and statistical properties of spatially correlated dynamics , or dynamical heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "dynamical heterogeneity has been observed both in deeply supercooled liquids @xcite , in the mildly supercooled regime in simulations @xcite , and in experiments on colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "heterogeneous dynamics , in combination with structural homogeneity , as observed in glass formers , appears in systems possessing both localized excitations and facilitated dynamics @xcite .",
    "the concept of dynamic facilitation stipulates that the dynamics of a local region is suppressed if is bordered by immobile regions , and thus reflects the idea that particles in a jammed liquid can not rearrange unless adjacent to mobile particles .",
    "dynamic facilitation is realized in kcms , which are simple models of non interacting particles or excitations in a lattice whose dynamics is subject to kinetic constraints ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "examples of kcms are spin facilitated models , like the fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model  @xcite or the east model  @xcite , and constrained lattice gases , such as the kob - andersen model  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the effect that dynamic facilitation has on the geometry of configuration space , and how in turn this affects the dynamics @xcite .",
    "we show , by generalizing kcms to continuous degrees of freedom , that kinetic constraints impose a metric structure on configuration space which does not affect the static distribution of states , and therefore the thermodynamics , but which has a dramatic effect on the paths between states at low energies .",
    "we show that dynamical slow - down at low temperatures occurs because the system is forced to evolve along configuration space paths of least metric distance , or geodesics , which are distinct from the paths that relax the energy .",
    "this competition between available trajectories and energy relaxation gives rise to dynamical barriers , or bottlenecks , which are unrelated to the statics of the system .",
    "this view of the dynamics is distinct from that based on the idea that a static rugged energy landscape is responsible for the properties of glass formers ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ geometric ]",
    "we discuss the geometric interpretation of dynamic facilitation . in sections [ examples ] and [ toy - model2 ]",
    "we illustrate our ideas with simple examples . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we state our conclusions .",
    "the real - space picture of supercooled liquids of refs.@xcite is based on two observations .",
    "first , at low temperature very few particles in the liquid are mobile , and these mobility excitations are localized in space .",
    "second , regions of the liquid can not become mobile unless their neighbouring regions are mobile .",
    "these observations are implemented as follows .",
    "a supercooled fluid in @xmath0 spatial dimensions is coarse - grained into cells of linear size of the order of the static correlation length as given by the pair correlation function .",
    "cells are classified by a scalar mobility field , @xmath1 , identified by coarse - graining the system on a microscopic time scale .",
    "mobile regions carry a free energy cost , and when mobility is low interactions between cells are not important . adopting a thermal language , we expect static equilibrium to be determined by the non - interacting hamiltonian , @xmath2 = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^n f_\\mu(x^\\mu),\\ ] ] where @xmath3 labels the lattice site , @xmath4 is the mobility field at site @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is an analytic function of @xmath4 chosen so that the ground state of the model is such that @xmath7 is small . at low mobility ,",
    "the distinction between single and multiple occupancy is irrelevant , as is the distinction between discrete or continuous degrees of freedom . in what follows",
    "we assume @xmath4 to be real .",
    "the dynamics of the mobility field is given by a master equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the probability that the system has configuration @xmath10 at time @xmath11 .",
    "the local operators @xmath12 are the same as those for unconstrained local dynamics . their action on @xmath13 can be written @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability of going from configuration @xmath16 to configuration @xmath17 in unit time .",
    "we ensure a unique equilibrium configuration exists by requiring ( [ master1 ] ) to obey detailed balance with respect to ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , i.e. @xmath18-h[x])}. \\label{db}\\ ] ] the kinetic constraint , @xmath19 , is designed to suppress the dynamics of cell @xmath5 when surrounded by immobile regions .",
    "it must also be such that eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) satisfies detailed balance , which is achieved if @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath4 itself . to reflect the local nature of dynamic facilitation we allow @xmath21 to depend only on the @xmath22 of nearest neighbours of @xmath5 , and",
    "require that @xmath21 is small when local mobility is scarce .",
    "equations ( [ hamiltonian])-([db ] ) define a generic kcm .",
    "we now show that eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) has a simple geometrical interpretation . using standard methods @xcite we pass from the master equation ( [ master1 ] ) to the fokker - planck equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 the prime on @xmath6 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "equation ( [ fokkerplanck ] ) has a simple physical interpretation : it describes single - particle driven diffusion on an @xmath25-dimensional curved space @xmath26 .",
    "the form of the driving term in ( [ fokkerplanck2 ] ) comes from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and the kinetic constraint .",
    "but the curvature of this space is due solely to the kinetic constraint : from the form of a fokker - planck equation on a curved manifold  @xcite we identify the inverse metric tensor of this space as @xmath27 .",
    "thus the metric reads @xmath28 no summation is implied .",
    "the effect of dynamic facilitation is to endow the configuration space @xmath1 with a nontrivial metric .",
    "since dynamic facilitation is responsible for the interesting dynamical properties of these models , we expect that these dynamical properties can be extracted from the metric tensor .",
    "the effect of the metric on configuration space trajectories is made clearer by writing a formal solution to equation ( [ fokkerplanck ] )  @xcite : @xmath29},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the conditional probability that a system starting at point @xmath31 in configuration space at time @xmath32 is found at point @xmath33 at time @xmath34 .",
    "we have introduced the determinant of the metric , @xmath35 .",
    "the path integral ( [ pathint ] ) is taken over all configurations of the system , weighted by the dynamic action @xmath36 $ ] . up to constant terms this action reads @xmath37 = \\frac{1}{t } \\left ( h[x_b]-h[x_a ] \\right )   + \\frac{1}{t } \\int_{t_a}^{t_b } dt\\ , \\left ( \\dot{x}^{\\mu } g_{\\mu \\nu } \\dot{x}^{\\nu } + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x^{\\mu } } g^{\\mu \\nu } \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x^{\\nu } } \\right),\\ ] ] where dots denote differentiation with respect to time , and the summation convention for once - repeated upper and lower indices is implied .",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) weights the configuration space trajectories of our system .",
    "the system s classical trajectory , i.e.  the path taken by the dynamics when @xmath38 , is one of extremum @xmath39 . at finite @xmath40 , stochastic fluctuations cause perturbations about this path . equation ( [ action ] ) shows clearly the way the various ingredients of a dynamically facilitated model influence its trajectory through configuration space .",
    "the first term depends only on the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) evaluated at the endpoints .",
    "it gives rise to boltzmann weights in the path integral ( [ pathint ] ) and plays no role in choosing the trajectory of the system .",
    "the path is chosen by a competition between the two terms in the integral of eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) .",
    "the first term , @xmath41 , is purely geometrical .",
    "it is the action for free motion in a curved background .",
    "it depends on the metric @xmath42 , and therefore on @xmath43 . the second term , @xmath44 , depends on the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , but is proportional to the inverse metric @xmath45 , and so to @xmath46 . at low temperatures ,",
    "we expect @xmath47 to be important only far from equilibrium , when mobility is plentiful  or equivalently , when the magnitudes of the coordinates @xmath48 are large and @xmath46 is large  and the system s relaxation will take place by way of gradient descent on the energy surface .",
    "when mobility has diminished significantly the constraints @xmath46 become small .",
    "we then expect @xmath49 to dominate .",
    "hence the classical trajectory of the system in the region of weak dynamic facilitation will be governed by extremum @xmath49 .",
    "this corresponds to the equation of a geodesic  @xcite : @xmath50 the christoffel symbols @xmath51 are defined as @xmath52 , and the metric tensor raises and lowers indices .",
    "equation ( [ geodesic1 ] ) tells us how the kinetic constraint controls the system s trajectory in configuration space in the dynamically constrained regime . when mobility is scarce , the constraint @xmath46 is small , and the metric distance between points in configuration space , @xmath53 , is large , by virtue of ( [ metric ] ) . by minimising this distance , and so following eq .",
    "( [ geodesic1 ] ) , we expect the system to follow a path that does not lead directly to a configuration of lowest energy .",
    "this is a geometrical interpretation of dynamical arrest .",
    "we now illustrate these ideas with a simple example . we define a model of two variables , @xmath54 , with each variable constraining the other .",
    "although such a model can not exhibit true glassiness it is useful because we can visualise directly the two - dimensional configuration space it inhabits .",
    "we choose the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) to be quadratic , @xmath55 where @xmath56 sets the energy scale .",
    "we choose the constraint functions to be quadratic also , with each coordinate constraining the other : @xmath57 thus , the fokker - planck equation ( [ fokkerplanck ] ) is determined .",
    "equation ( [ metric ] ) gives the metric of this system as @xmath58 the metric is singular , and so distances in this configuration space become very large , when @xmath1 or @xmath59 vanish , reflecting the tendency of the kinetic constraint to suppress the dynamics of the system in the regime of low mobility . the space described by this metric is negatively curved with curvature scalar @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the geodesics follow from ( [ geodesic1 ] ) which in this case read @xmath61 to illustrate the effect of the kinetic constraint on the trajectories chosen by the system we first cast equation ( [ fokkerplanck ] ) into a form more convenient for numerical simulation . in the usual way",
    "@xcite we recognize that ( [ fokkerplanck ] ) is equivalent to the coupled langevin equations @xmath62 where the gaussian white noise variables @xmath63 have zero mean and variance @xmath64 . in this representation",
    "the kinetic constraint manifests itself as a state dependent rate : the driving term is linear in @xmath46 while the noise term goes as @xmath65 . the unconstrained version of the same model , i.e. one for which @xmath66 , would have langevin equation @xmath67 .",
    "we now show explicitly that low temperature trajectories with fixed initial and final configurations are approximated by the geodesic equation ( [ geodesic2 ] ) .",
    "we have used transition path sampling ( tps ) @xcite to ensure that we obtained a set of trajectories which both obeyed the endpoint conditions are were well - sampled from the dynamical action ( [ action ] ) . in order to generate out - of - equilibrium trajectories for the relaxation from high energy configurations we used the crooks - chandler @xcite algorithm ; alternatives such as the local algorithm of ref.@xcite are also suitable .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the comparison of the dynamical evolution of our toy kcm with the geometry of its configuration space .",
    "tps was used on the system defined by eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) to generate trajectories between the configurations indicated by a star . in fig.1a",
    "we show both a characteristic trajectory ( thin red path ) and the average over the set of all trajectories obtained via tps ( thick blue path ) .",
    "we also show geodesics ( black curves ) joining the final configuration to the initial configuration ( indicated by a star ) , and to other configurations along the gradient descent path ( indicated by black squares ) .",
    "the solutions to ( [ geodesic2 ] ) are degenerate : there is one geodesic going left from the initial point and another going right .",
    "the distinction depends on the initial conditions on the path . in the tps simulations we force the initial displacement to be to the left to obtain a set of trajectories which follows the left hand geodesics",
    "these are the paths shown in fig .",
    "1a and 1b . in fig .",
    "1b we also show the average over a small set of right hand tps trajectories and the corresponding pairs of geodesics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see the features described in the previous section .",
    "initially the system is in the high energy region and it relaxes approximately by gradient descent .",
    "as it reaches the region of weak dynamic facilitation at low energies , the system relaxes by following approximately the geodesics of configuration space . shown for comparison in fig .",
    "1a are the trajectories followed by an unconstrained version of the same model ( dashed green path ) . in this case relaxation",
    "is by gradient descent . given that the rate for motion in the @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) direction vanishes when @xmath59 ( resp.@xmath1 ) vanishes , trajectories have to cross the coordinate axis orthogonally , which gives trajectories ( and geodesics ) a `` rectangular '' shape .",
    "equipotential lines are concentric circles , and the conflict between allowed dynamical paths and energy relaxation is evident .",
    "we can gain more insight into the nature of dynamic facilitation by considering an even simpler , one - variable model .",
    "this can be thought of as modeling facilitated dynamics for an order parameter , rather than for microscopic variables .",
    "equations ( [ fokkerplanck ] ) and ( [ fokkerplanck2 ] ) tell us that an @xmath25-variable , dynamically constrained system looks like a single particle diffusing in @xmath25 space dimensions .",
    "thus a one - variable dynamically constrained model looks like a single particle diffusing in one space dimension .",
    "we can exploit the fact that one dimensional spaces are always flat  @xcite to ` remove ' the kinetic constraint .",
    "we will see below that this can be done at the expense of introducing an effective free energy barrier .",
    "consider a model with one degree of freedom , @xmath1 , with hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) @xmath68 .",
    "we choose the dynamical constraint to be @xmath69 .",
    "this differs from the higher - dimensional cases in that the variable constrains itself .",
    "consequently , the transformation from fokker - planck to langevin form is ambiguous  @xcite , and depends on whether one choses pre - point or mid - point discretisation of time - dependent quantities ( it or stratonovich calculus ) .",
    "we choose the former , so that our model is causal .",
    "the langevin description of our one - variable model is then @xmath70 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath1 , and the noise term @xmath71 has zero mean and variance @xmath72 . since in this case the constraint depends on the variable it constrains , the second term on the right hand side of ( [ onevar ] ) is needed to ensure an equilibrium density proportional to @xmath73 @xcite . in the higher - dimensional cases we considered above",
    "there was no self - facilitation and this term was absent .",
    "the corresponding unconstrained model has @xmath74 , and its langevin equation is @xmath75 .",
    "the appearance of the multiplicative noise term @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ onevar ] ) is due to the metric - augmented diffusion term in ( [ fokkerplanck2 ] ) , and is therefore a consequence of the kinetic constraint .",
    "the statement that a one - dimensional space is flat is equivalent to the statement that the noise may be made additive by a local change of variables .",
    "if we make the change of variables @xmath77 we can use it s formula  @xcite to rewrite ( [ onevar ] ) as @xmath78 where @xmath1 should be eliminated in favour of @xmath59 .",
    "the noise @xmath79 has the same mean and variance as @xmath71 .",
    "provided we can write the deterministic terms in ( [ onevar2 ] ) as the gradient of an effective potential we can regard equation ( [ onevar2 ] ) as unconstrained , in the sense that the prefactor of the noise does not contain the dependent variable .",
    "consider the specific case of a quadratic constraint , @xmath80 .",
    "equation ( [ onevar ] ) becomes @xmath81 where we have assumed @xmath82 .",
    "the change of variables ( [ change - of - variables ] ) now amounts to a cole - hopf transformation , @xmath83 .",
    "hence the regime where dynamic facilitation is relevant corresponds to @xmath84 .",
    "equation ( [ onevar2 ] ) now reads @xmath85 equation ( [ unconstrained ] ) looks like an unconstrained model with an effective _ entropic _ barrier @xmath86 , which prevents the particle from accessing the dynamically constrained regime of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates this .",
    "in this paper we have presented a geometric interpretation of dynamic facilitation . by generalizing kinetically constrained models to continuous degrees of freedom",
    "we have shown that in these systems the kinetic constraints can be seen as endowing configuration space with a non - trivial metric structure .",
    "this metric structure in turn determines the dynamical trajectories . in the regime where the kinetic constraint is dominant ,",
    "i.e.  at low temperatures or energies , the geometry forces the dynamics to proceed through paths close to geodesics , rather than close to paths which relax the energy .",
    "this conflict between available paths and energy relaxation gives rise to dynamical bottlenecks or barriers , despite the fact that there are no static barriers in these systems .",
    "our view of dynamical arrest in terms of the geometry of configuration space is distinct from that based on the idea of motion in an effective rugged energy ( or free energy ) landscape ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the landscape perspective it is often assumed that relevant features of the energy surface , like local minima and saddle points , determine the behaviour of the system , and that knowledge of the statistical properties of these features is sufficient to explain both dynamic and thermodynamic properties . in our approach",
    "the effective energy surface displays no particular features , the thermodynamics is uninteresting , and there are no special configurations , such as local minima or saddles , which play any major roles either in the statics or in the dynamics .",
    "all the interesting structure is in the paths between configurations , and therefore in the dynamics . in this picture",
    "it is the effective metric structure of configuration space that distinguishes a glassy system from a normal one , and not the ruggedness of its energy surface .",
