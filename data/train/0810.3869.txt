    "wireless operators are in the process of augmenting the macrocell network with supplemental infrastructure such as microcells , distributed antennas and relays .",
    "an alternative with lower upfront costs is to improve indoor coverage and capacity using the concept of _ end - consumer _ installed femtocells or home base stations@xcite .",
    "a femtocell is a low power , short range ( @xmath3 meters ) wireless data access point ( ap ) that provides in - building coverage to home users and transports the user traffic over the internet - based ip backhaul such as cable modem or dsl . femtocell users experience superior indoor reception and can lower their transmit power .",
    "consequently , femtocells provide higher spatial reuse and cause less interference to other users .    due to cross - tier interference in a two - tier network with shared spectrum , the target per - tier sinrs among macrocell and femtocell",
    "users are coupled .",
    "the notion of a sinr",
    " target \" models a certain application dependent minimum quality of service ( qos ) requirement per user .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that femtocell users and cellular users seek different sinrs ( data rates )  typically higher data rates using femtocells  because home users deploy femtocells in their self interest , and because of the proximity to their bs .",
    "however , the qos improvement arising from femtocells should come at an expense of reduced cellular coverage .",
    "contemporary wireless systems employ power control to assist users experiencing poor channels and to limit interference caused to neighboring cells . in a two - tier network however , cross - tier interference may significantly hinder the performance of conventional power control schemes .",
    "for example , signal strength based power control ( channel inversion ) employed by cellular users results in unacceptable deterioration of femtocell sinrs@xcite .",
    "the reason is because a user on its cell - edge transmits with higher power to meet its receive power target , and causes excessive cross - tier interference at nearby femtocells .",
    "interference management in two - tier networks faces practical challenges from the lack of coordination between the macrocell base - station ( bs ) and femtocell aps due to reasons of scalability , security and limited availability of backhaul bandwidth@xcite . from an infrastructure or spectrum availability perspective",
    ", it may be easier to operate the macrocell and femtocells in a common spectrum ; at the same time , pragmatic solutions are necessary to reduce cross - tier interference . an open access ( oa ) scheme@xcite , which performs radio management by vertical handoffs ",
    "forcing cellular users to communicate with nearby femtocells to load balance traffic in each tier  is one such solution .",
    "a drawback of oa is the network overhead @xcite and the need for sufficient backhaul capacity to avoid starving the paying home user .",
    "additionally , oa potentially compromises security and qos for home users .",
    "this work assumes _ closed access _",
    "( ca ) , which means only licensed home users within radio range can communicate with their own femtocell .",
    "with ca , cross - tier interference from interior femtocells may significantly deteriorate the sinr at the macrocell bs .",
    "the motivation behind this paper is ensuring that the service ( data rates ) provided to cellular users remain unaffected by a femtocell underlay which operates in the same spectrum .",
    "three main reasons are    the macrocell s primary role of an anytime anywhere infrastructure , especially for mobile and  isolated \" users without hotspot access ,    the greater number of users served by each macrocell bs , and    the end user deployment of femtocells in their self - interest    .",
    "the macrocell is consequently modeled as primary infrastructure , meaning that the operator s foremost obligation is to ensure that an outdoor cellular user achieves its minimum sinr target at its bs , despite cross - tier femtocell interference .",
    "indoor users act in their self interest to maximize their sinrs , but incur a sinr penalty because they cause cross - tier interference .    considering a macrocell bs with @xmath4 cochannel femtocells and one transmitting user per slot per cell over the uplink ,",
    "the following questions are addressed in this paper :    * given a set of feasible target sinrs inside femtocell hotspots , what is the largest cellular sinr target for which a non - negative power allocation exists for all users in the system ? * how does the cellular sinr depend on the locations of macrocell and femtocell users and cellular parameters such as the channel gains between cellular users and femtocells ? * given an utility - based femtocell sinr adaptation with a certain minimum qos requirement at each femtocell , what are the ensuing sinr equilibria and can they be achieved in a distributed fashion ? * when a cellular user can not satisfy its sinr target due to cross - tier interference , by how much should femtocells reduce their sinr target to ensure that the cellular user s sinr requirement is met ?",
    "although this work exclusively focuses on the uplink in a tiered cellular system , we would like to clarify that portions of our analysis ( section iii ) are also applicable in the downlink with potentially different conclusions .",
    "due to space limitations , the downlink extension is omitted for future work .",
    "prior research in cellular power control and rate assignments in tiered networks mainly considered an operator planned underlay of a macrocell with single / multiple microcells@xcite . in the context of this paper , a microcell has a much larger radio range ( 100 - 500 m ) than a femtocell , and generally implies centralized deployment , i.e. by the service - provider .",
    "a microcell underlay allows the operator to handoff and load balance users between each tier@xcite .",
    "for example , the operator can preferentially assign high data rate users to a microcell @xcite because of its inherently larger capacity .",
    "in contrast , femtocells are consumer installed and the traffic requirements at femtocells are user determined without any operator influence . consequently , distributed interference management strategies may be preferred",
    ".    our work ties in with well known power control schemes in conventional cellular networks and prior work on utility optimization based on game theory .",
    "results in foschini _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , zander@xcite , grandhi _ _ et al.__@xcite and bambos _ _ et al.__@xcite provide conditions for sinr feasibility and/or sir balancing in cellular systems .",
    "specifically , in a network with @xmath4 users with target sinrs @xmath5 , a feasible power allocation for all users exists iff the spectral radius of the normalized channel gain matrix is less than unity . associated results on centralized / distributed / constrained power control , link admission control and user - bs assignment are presented in @xcite and numerous other works .",
    "the utility - based non - cooperative femtocell sinr adaptation presented here is related to existing game theory literature on non - cooperative cellular power control@xcite ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "the adaptation forces stronger femtocell interferers to obtain their sinr equilibria closer to their minimum sinr targets , while femtocells causing smaller cross - tier interference obtain higher sinr margins .",
    "this is similar to xiao and shroff@xcite s utility - based power control ( ubpc ) scheme , wherein users vary their target sirs based on the prevailing traffic conditions . unlike the sigmoidal utility in @xcite , our utility function has a more meaningful interpretation because it models    the femtocell user s inclination to seek higher data - rates and    the primary role of the macrocell while penalizing the femtocell user for causing cross - tier interference .",
    "our sinr equilibria is simple to characterize unlike the feasibility conditions presented in prior works e.g @xcite .    to minimize cross - tier interference ,",
    "prior femtocell research has proposed open access @xcite , varying femtocell coverage area @xcite , hybrid frequency assignments@xcite , adjusting the maximum transmit power of femtocell users @xcite and adaptive access operation of femtocells @xcite .",
    "in contrast , this paper addresses sinr adaptation and ensuring acceptable cellular performance in closed access femtocells .",
    "related works in cognitive radio ( cr ) literature such as @xcite propose that secondary users limit their transmission powers for reducing interference to primary users ( pus ) . in @xcite , cr users regulate their transmit powers to limit pu interference , but their work does not address individual rate requirements at each cr . qian _ _ et al.__@xcite propose a joint power and admission control scheme , but provide little insight on how a cr user s data - rate is influenced by a pu s rate .",
    "in contrast , our results are applicable in cr networks for determining the _ exact relationship _ between the feasible sinrs of primary and cr users ; further our sinr adaptation can enable cr users to vary their data - rates in a decentralized manner based on instantaneous interference at pu receivers .",
    "near - far effects in a cochannel two - tier network are captured through a theoretical analysis providing the highest cellular sinr target  for which a non - negative power allocation exists between all transmit - receive pairs ",
    "given any set of femtocell sinrs and vice versa . with a common sinr target at femtocells and neglecting interference between femtocells , the per - tier pareto sinr pairs have an intuitive interpretation : the sum of the decibel ( db ) cellular sinr and the db femtocell sinr equals a constant .",
    "design interpretations are provided for different path loss exponents , different numbers of femtocells and varying locations of the cellular user and hotspots .",
    "femtocells individually maximize an objective function consisting of a sinr dependent reward , and a penalty proportional to the interference at the macrocell .",
    "we obtain a _ channel - dependant sinr equilibrium _ at each femtocell .",
    "the equilibrium discourages strongly interfering femtocells to use large transmit powers .",
    "this sinr equilibrium is attained using distributed power updates@xcite . for femtocell users",
    "whose objective is to simply equal their minimum sinr targets , our adaptation simplifies to the foschini - miljanic ( fm ) update .",
    "numerical results show that the utility adaptation provides up to @xmath0 higher femtocell sinrs relative to fm .",
    "to alleviate cross - tier interference when the cellular user does not achieve its sinr target , we propose a distributed algorithm to progressively reduce sinr targets of strongest femtocell interferers until the cellular sinr target is met . numerical simulations with @xmath1 femtocells / cell - site show acceptable cellular coverage with a worst - case femtocell sinr reduction of only @xmath2 ( with typical cellular parameters ) .",
