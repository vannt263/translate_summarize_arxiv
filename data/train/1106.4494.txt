    "predictions from any candidate theory of quantum gravity can be well tested by cosmology as this area of physics can test physics at energies much higher than the collider experiments . until we get a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity we can study the applications of the existing theories in cosmological scenarios .",
    "quite recently string theory has made remarkable efforts to solve some of the age old problems in understanding our universe @xcite . in the pre big bang scenario based on the string effective action @xcite ,",
    "the birth of the universe is described by a transition from the string perturbative vacuum with weak coupling , low curvature and cold state to the standard radiation dominated regime , passing through a high curvature and strong coupling phase .",
    "this transition is made by the kinetic energy term of the dilaton , a scalar field with which the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity is augmented ( also see @xcite and the references therein for a brief review of string dilaton cosmology ) .",
    "duality is one of the key feature of string dilaton cosmology . if the scale factor is a solution of the equation of motion then the inverse of the former is also a solution .",
    "this indicates that our universe behaves like a string , i.e. , has a minimal size of the order of string scale and maximal size of the order of inverse string scale .",
    "the idea that the uncertainty principle could be affected by gravity was first given by mead @xcite .",
    "later modified commutation relations between position and momenta commonly known as the generalized uncertainty principle ( or gup ) were proposed by candidate theories of quantum gravity such as , string theory , doubly special relativity theory ( or dsr ) and black hole physics with the prediction of a minimum measurable length @xcite .",
    "similar kind of commutation relation can also be found in the context of polymer quantization in terms of polymer mass scale @xcite . from the point of view of perturbative string theory , strings can not probe distances smaller than their own size .",
    "this is the key idea for the prediction of a minimum measurable length . to incorporate the existence of a minimal length in usual quantum mechanics , the standard commutation relation between position and momenta gets modified along with the hilbert space representation @xcite . in one dimension",
    "the form of this generalized uncertainty principle can be expressed by the associative heisenberg algebra generated by @xmath1 and @xmath2 obeying the relation ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 = i~ \\hbar ~ ( 1+\\beta ~p^2)~~.\\ ] ] the corresponding uncertainty relation can be written as @xmath5~~.\\ ] ] it is clear from the above equations that the smallest uncertainty in position has the value @xmath6 if @xmath7 we get usual heisenberg uncertainty relation . here",
    "@xmath8 must be related to the plank length .",
    "more general cases and applications of such commutation relations are studied in @xcite . since the scale factors",
    ", matter fields and their conjugate momenta play the role of dynamical variables in cosmological models so the application of the generalized uncertainty principle in constructing the phase space of these models is reasonably relevant .",
    "many researchers have expressed a vested interest in studying the classical and quantum solutions of some cosmological models in the gup framework and also in noncommutative literature @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed a gup which is consistent with dsr theory , string theory and black hole physics and which says @xmath9 = \\left[p_i , p_j\\right ] = 0 , \\ ] ] @xmath10 = i \\hbar \\left [   \\delta_{ij } -   l   \\left ( p \\delta_{ij } + \\frac{p_i p_j}{p } \\right ) + l^2   \\left ( p^2 \\delta_{ij }   + 3 p_{i } p_{j } \\right )   \\right],\\ ] ] @xmath11   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2 } \\left [ 1   +   \\left(\\frac{l}{\\sqrt{\\langle p^2 \\rangle } } + 4 l^2   \\right )   \\delta p^2   +   4 l^2 \\langle p \\rangle^2 -   2 l \\sqrt{\\langle p^2 \\rangle } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the plank length ( @xmath16 ) . for a brief discussion on equation ( [ e2 ] )",
    "see appendix .",
    "it is normally assumed that the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 is of the order unity .",
    "if this is the case then the @xmath18 dependent terms are only important at or near the plank regime .",
    "but here we expect the existence of a new intermediate physical length scale of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "we also note that this unobserved length scale can not exceed the electroweak length scale @xcite which implies @xmath20 .",
    "these equations are approximately covariant under dsr transformations but not lorentz covariant @xcite",
    ". these equations also imply @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the plank mass and @xmath24 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "it can be shown that equation ( [ e2 ] ) is satisfied by the following definitions ( see appendix ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28= i \\hbar \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "here we can interpret @xmath29 as the momentum at low energies having the standard representation in position space ( @xmath30 ) with @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the momentum at high energies . using ( [ defi ] ) ( to the best of our knowledge , this definition is unique ) we can also show that the @xmath33 term in the kinetic part of any hamiltonian ( including relativistic ones ) can be written as @xcite @xmath34 here we neglect terms @xmath35 and higher in comparison to terms @xmath36 to study the effect of the linear term in @xmath18 in the first approximation as @xmath37 . given the robust nature of gup",
    ", such corrections will continue to play a role irrespective of what other quantum gravity corrections one may consider .",
    "in other words , they are in some sense universal ! the effect of this proposed gup is well studied recently for some well known physical systems in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to study a dilaton cosmological model with an exponential dilaton potential .",
    "we will study the model with a suitable metric and a particular lapse function . at the beginning we will concentrate on the classical solutions .",
    "later we will study the effect of the modified uncertainty principle ( from now on we will use the terminology modified uncertainty principle or mup for the recently proposed gup @xcite to distinguish it from the earlier version ) on the classical model . in the next half of the paper we are going to study the quantum model . in each case",
    "we are going to solve the wheeler - dewitt equation but with a relevant approximation and compare the results .",
    "as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the newtonian coupling constant , we can imply that the extra terms in the uncertainty relation ( [ e2 ] ) is a consequence of strong gravity .",
    "so studying early universe quantum cosmological models in the mup framework is physically relevant . here",
    "we will apply the minisuperspace approach of quantum gravity where one reduces a large number of degrees of freedom by imposing symmetry conditions on the metric .",
    "since our model has two degrees of freedom , the scale factor and the dilaton field , the study of this model within the mup framework appears to have physical grounds .",
    "the four dimensional gravi - dilaton effective action in the string frame can be written as @xcite @xmath40~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the dilaton field , @xmath42 is the fundamental string length ( @xmath43 ) parameter and @xmath44 is the dilaton potential . in the string frame",
    "the fundamental unit is the string length @xmath43 , and thus the planck mass , which is the effective coefficient of the ricci scalar @xmath45 , varies with the dilaton .",
    "an alternative way to describe things is to use the einstein frame which is physically more transparent than the string frame . in the einstein frame",
    "it is the plank length which is more directly related to the macroscopic physics through the strength of gravity which is used as a fundamental unit .",
    "so we would like to prefer the einstein frame and in this frame the action ( [ a1 ] ) takes the form @xcite @xmath46~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the four dimensional plank mass .",
    "it is to be noted that now the sign of the kinetic term of the scalar field is familiar to us .",
    "we consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime which is specified by the metric of the form @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lapse function and @xmath50 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the model can be easily expressed as @xmath51 we now use a set of transformations @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a positive constant , so that we can finally write the hamiltonian decoupled in the variables @xmath1 and @xmath54 . in these new variables the lagrangian can be written as @xmath55 here we take the opportunity to choose the potential as @xmath56 so that the lagrangian can be written as @xmath57 we have a physical motivation for choosing this potential as this type of potential finds its use in quintessence model of dark energy ( for a brief review see @xcite and the references therein ) and also used in an inflationary model @xcite . with the above lagrangian the hamiltonian constraint can be written as ) is that the minisuperspace is curved in terms of the original coordinates ( see ( [ lagran ] ) ) and the application of some deformed commutation relation like gup is not an easy task . however , we know that any 2-d riemannian space is conformally flat and if the ricci scalar is zero this space will be minkowskian .",
    "this means that there is a set of coordinates in terms of which the metric is flat . in our case",
    "the 2-d minisuperspace ( spanned by @xmath58 and @xmath41 ) is a riemannian space with vanishing ricci scalar .",
    "therefore one can find a coordinate transformation ( [ trans ] ) in terms of which the minisupermetric takes the form of a minkowskian space ( see([ham ] ) ) .",
    "we also note that we did not introduce a canonical transformation and therefore after introducing the new coordinates all of the quantum analysis should be done based on them and one should not make an inverse transformation in the wave functions . ]",
    "@xmath59 the minisuperspace of this model is a two dimensional manifold @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "its non - singular boundary is the line @xmath62 with @xmath63 , while at singular boundaries at least one of the two variables is infinite @xcite . in terms of the new variables @xmath1 and @xmath54 the minisuperspace is recovered by @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the non singular boundary may be represented by @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "in this section we are going to study the classical solutions for the above hamiltonian .",
    "we will study the commutative case followed by the mup effects on the model .      in the gauge",
    "@xmath67 we can get the equations of motion for the above hamiltonian keeping in mind that the phase space variables satisfy @xmath68 the equations of motion for the hamiltonian in ( [ ham ] ) are @xmath69 a straight forward integration yields @xmath70 here @xmath71 are the arbitrary integration constants to be evaluated with suitable initial conditions . with these solutions and the constraint equation @xmath72",
    "it can be easily shown that classically only half of the minisuperspace @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) is recovered by the dynamical variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "considering @xmath77 and @xmath78 and using the transformation ( [ trans ] ) we can get @xmath79 and @xmath80    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in fig.([psimup ] ) we have plotted the square of the mup wave function on the @xmath81 plane for the asymptotic limit @xmath82 . from the figure",
    "we can clearly see that the largest peak is centered around non - zero values of @xmath1 and @xmath54 .",
    "but in the commutative case the highest peak is around zero values of @xmath1 and @xmath54 .",
    "this difference in the position of the highest peak seems to portray the mup effect . here",
    "also we found several other peaks but the density is noticeably lower than the commutative case .",
    "so possible states are less in the mup framework .",
    "in this paper we have studied the dilaton cosmological model with an exponential dilaton potential in the framework of the recently proposed modified uncertainty principle ( or mup ) @xcite .",
    "this mup has a linear term in plank length and here our aim is to study the effect of this term in the context of early universe .",
    "replacing the commutation relation of the position and the momentum operator by their poisson brackets we studied the classical dilaton model in the flat frw background . as an effect of the mup we found that the universe can undergo a late time acceleration under certain choice of some parameters of the problem .",
    "this seems quite interesting that an extra term which modifies the usual heisenberg algebra having its origin in the realm of quantum gravity also contributing enormously to the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "later we studied quantum cosmology under the same considerations taken before . in the commutative case we found the highest peak of the wave function",
    "is centered around @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "also there are several other smaller peaks with non - zero positive values of @xmath1 and @xmath54 .",
    "this could be interpreted as our universe might have evolved from one of those peaks(analogous to states in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "it is possible that the present universe could have evolved from one or different states with positive values of @xmath1 and @xmath54 .",
    "this also indicates that the dilatonic field @xmath85 should be zero or have positive values .",
    "this result supports our classical time evolution of the dilatonic field . in the mup framework",
    "we have presented approximate analytical solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation . in this case the wave function peaks around some non - zero positive values of @xmath1 and @xmath54 . here",
    "also we found several smaller peaks but the density of peaks is less than the commutative case .",

    "<S> for the quantum mechanical description in both commutative and mup framework , we found the analytical solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation for the early universe and compare our results . </S>",
    "<S> we have used an approximation method in the case of mup . </S>",
