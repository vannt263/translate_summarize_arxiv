    "after a long period of silence in the field on non - newtoninan calculus introduced by grossmann and katz @xcite in 1972 , the field experienced a revival with the mathematically comprehensive description of geometric multiplicative calculus by bashirov et al .",
    "@xcite , which initiated a kickstart of numerous publications in this field .",
    "grossmann and katz have shown that it is possible to create infinitely many calculi independently @xcite .",
    "they constructed a comprehensive family of calculi , including the newtonian or leibnizian calculus , the geometric - multiplicative calculus , the bigeometric calculus , and infinitely - many other calculi . in 1972 , they completed their book non - newtonian calculus @xcite summarising all the findings , i.e. nine specific non - newtonian calculi , the general theory of non - newtonian calculus , and heuristic guides for applications .",
    "geometric multiplicative and bigeometric calculus have been becoming more and more popular in the past decade .",
    "various applications of these two fundamental multiplicative calculi have been proposed .",
    "exemplarily , without claim to completeness we want to state here some of the application areas of these two multiplicative calculi .",
    "geometric multiplicative calculus based on the works on @xcite and @xcite was applied to various fields as modelling finance , economics and demographics using differential equation @xcite ; numerical approximation methods @xcite ; biological image analysis@xcite ; application on literary texts @xcite . in order to circumvent the restriction of geometric multiplicative calculus to positive valued functions of real variable ,",
    "the geometric multiplicative calculus was extended to complex multiplicative calculus .",
    "after @xcite proposed an extension to geometric multiplicative calculus to complex valued function of complex variable , a comprehensive mathematical description of the multiplicative complex analysis was presented by bashirov and riza in @xcite .",
    "uzer , furthermore used multiplicative calculus to model problems in antenna theory , we would like to refer to @xcite .",
    "applications of bigeometric calculus can be found in the field of nonlinear dynamics by the group of rybaczuk .",
    "we want to refer to the works @xcite .    especially in the area of biology , there exist numerous mathematical models based on differential equations being quite hard to solve using standard solution methods for ordinary differential equations .",
    "the 4th order runge - kutta method is widely used for the numerical solution of these differential equations .",
    "exemplarily , we want to refer to the modelling of gene expression using differential equations @xcite , modelling tumor growth @xcite , or modelling bacteria growth and cancer @xcite .",
    "these type of problems is used for the modelling of relative change of the numbers of cells , genes , bacteria , and viruses .",
    "therefore , the geometric , as well as the bigeoemetric calculus , build the proper framework for the solution of these problems .",
    "the first flavour of a multiplicative derivative was given by @xcite , where volterra and hostinsky propose a derivative for a matrix function .",
    "later on , the multiplicative derivative , underlying this study , was proposed two times independently in literature .",
    "the first appearance dates back to 1972 to the work by @xcite where the bigeometric derivative was introduced , next @xcite introduces in his study in 2006 the same derivative under the name proportional derivative . in the following",
    ", we will use the terminology bigeometric derivative for the basic underlying derivative of this study .",
    "unfortunately , a complete description for the bigeometric , or proportional derivative is not available .",
    "based on the extensive study of the geometric multiplicative calculus given by @xcite , we will state the properties of the bigeometric derivative and the bigeometric taylor expansion in the framework of this calculus explicitly , exploiting the straightforward relation between the geometric multiplicative and the bigeometric derivative . the rules of bigeometric differentiation will be elaborated and presented explicitly in section [ sec2 ] and appendix [ bgdrproof ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that , compared to the geometric multiplicative derivative , the bigeometric derivative is scale free . from the proof of the bigeometric taylor theorem it is self - evident why the bigeometric taylor expansion could not be found that easily . as an application of bigeometric calculus",
    ", the bigeometric - runge - kutta method will be derived in analogy to the geometric runge - kutta method proposed by riza and aktre @xcite for the solution of bigeometric initial value problems will be derived on the basis of the bigeometric taylor theorem explicitly in section [ sec3 ] . before the conclusion of this paper , the presented method",
    "is applied to two types of problems in section [ sec4 ] . on the one hand",
    "the bigeometric runge kutta method and the ordinary runge kutta method are applied to two basic problems with known closed form solutions , in order to be able to compare the two methods with respect to error estimations and performance , on the other both methods are applied to an example for mathematical modelling on tumor growth by @xcite to show the general applicability of the proposed method . in both types of examples , we could identify that the bigeometric runge kutta method shows a considerable better performance compared to the ordinary runge kutta method for the same accuracy .",
    "in this section we will first discuss the properties of the bigeometric derivative based on the relationship between the bigeometric derivative with the geometric multiplicative derivative to derive the bigeometric taylor theorem from the geometric - multiplicative taylor theorem stated in @xcite .",
    "the bigeometric derivative is given as :    @xmath0    calculating the limit gives the relation between the bigeometric derivative and the ordinary derivative .",
    "@xmath1    the complete differentiation rules of geometric - multiplicative differentiation are presented in @xcite . as mentioned above , not all differentiation rules of the bigeometric derivative",

    "the idea for the derivation of the bigeometric taylor theorem is straightforward .",
    "we use the relation between the bigeometric derivative and the geometric multiplicative derivative to establish the relations for higher order derivatives as well .",

    "a suitable choice of the parameters actually depend also on the nature of the problem . in the case of the ordinary runge - kutta method ,",
    "the following set of parameters is widely used , i. e. @xmath70    the function is evaluated at four positions , i.e. at @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",

    "of course , a more detailed analysis has to be carried out to show exactly for which class of initial value problems the bigeometric runge - kutta method turns out to be more advantageous compared to the ordinary runge - kutta method .",
