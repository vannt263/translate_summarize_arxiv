    "the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) provides a very sensitive probe of lepton - number ( @xmath1 ) violating interactions .",
    "the most commonly quoted origin of @xmath0 is the @xmath2-component of majorana neutrino mass matrix in the charged lepton mass eigenbasis , which is given by ( m^)_ee = _ i u_ei^2 m_i = c_12 ^ 2c_13 ^ 2e^i_1m_1+s_12 ^ 2 c_13 ^ 2e^i_2m_2+s_13 ^ 2e^i_3m_3 , where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are the neutrino mass eigenvalues , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 denote the mixing angles and cp phases in the @xmath8 neutrino mixing matrix @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "recently there has been a report to claim @xmath0 with half - life time @xmath12 yrs @xcite . though the claim is still debatable  @xcite ,",
    "some implications of this observation have been discussed already in many papers @xcite .",
    "if the origin of @xmath0 were due to @xmath13 , the data suggest [ numass_dbeta ] |(m^)_ee|= 0.1 -0.6  ev .",
    "when combined with the information from atmospheric and solar neutrino data , this value of @xmath13 severely constrains the possible form of neutrino mass matrix . in particular",
    ", it does not allow the neutrino mass eigenvalues in normal hierarchy .",
    "as is well known , the atmospheric neutrino data imply  @xcite m^2_atm |m_3 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2|310 ^ -3 ev^2,as for the solar neutrino anomaly , the following four - solutions are possible  @xcite : & & m^2_sol=|m_2 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2| ^2 2_12 + lma : & & 3.210 ^ -5 ev^2 0.75 + sma : & & 5.010 ^ -6 ev^2 2.410 ^ -3 + low : & & 1.010",

    "there exists also a constraint on @xmath14 from the chooz reactor experiment  @xcite : _ 13 0.2 . if the neutrino mass eigenvalues are in normal hierarchy , i.e. @xmath15 , which is one of the plausible scenarios , the above information on @xmath5 and @xmath3 imply [ numass_osc ] |(m^)_ee|=\\ {    ll ( 2 - 5)10 ^ -3 ev & ( lma ) + 10 ^ -6 ev - max(m_1 , s_13 ^ 2 m_3 ) & ( sma ) + 10 ^ -4 ev - s_13 ^ 2 m_3 & ( low ) + 10 ^ -5 ev - s_13 ^ 2 m_3 & ( vac )    .",
    "where s_13 ^ 2 m_3= 210 ^ -3 ( ) ev 210 ^ -3 ev .",
    "obviously , these values of @xmath13 are too small to induce @xmath0 with @xmath12 yrs .",
    "so if the claimed @xmath0 turns out to be correct , we would have either ( approximately ) degenerate neutrino masses or the observed @xmath0 is _ not _ due to @xmath13 , but due to some other @xmath1-violating interactions .",
    "this would be true as long as @xmath16 yrs which can be tested in future experiments @xcite .",
    "the possibility that @xmath0 is dominantly induced by @xmath1-violating interactions _ other than _ @xmath13 has been discussed before in the context of specific models @xcite , and also a brief operator analysis of @xmath0 has been made in @xcite . in this paper , we wish to provide a more detailed operator analysis of @xmath0 by studying generic @xmath1-violating but baryon - number ( @xmath17 ) conserving higher - dimensional operators of the standard model ( sm ) fields which may induce @xmath0 .",
    "the main focus will be given to the possibility that @xmath18 yrs though @xmath13 is in the range of ( [ numass_osc ] ) .",

    "it can be applied also to models in which @xmath0 is induced by either a strong dynamics or quantum gravity effects at energy scales near the tev scale .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we classify the @xmath1-violating operators of the sm fields which can trigger @xmath0 . in section iii , we tabulate the contraint on those @xmath19 operators from the condition @xmath20 yrs , and also estimate @xmath13 which would be radiatively - induced by the operators triggering @xmath0 . in section iv ,",
    "we consider two specific models , i.e. a left - right symmetric model @xcite and a model with scalar diquark and dilepton @xcite , which can give @xmath18 yrs , while having @xmath13 in the range of ( [ numass_osc ] ) .",
    "we match our results to the previous analysis on these models .",

    "a complete analysis of @xmath21 operators which would induce a nonzero majorana neutrino mass can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 @xmath0 process may be induced by a double insertion of @xmath22 interactions or a single insertion of @xmath19 interaction . however with the sm fields alone",
    ", there is no way to construct a @xmath17-conserving operator with @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath0 occurs at energy scales far below the weak scale , the effects of quark - flavor - changing sm interactions on @xmath0 are suppressed by the small fermi constant and also the small quark - mixing angles .",
    "also there is no renormalizable lepton - flavor - changing interaction in the sm . with these observations",
    ", we can ignore the effects of fermion - flavor - violation , so limit the analysis to the @xmath19 operators containing only the first generation of quarks and leptons .",
    "we also limit our study only to the operators without spacetime derivative or gauge field .",
    "we use a notation in which all fermions are two - component weyl spinors , i.e. @xmath23 is a left - handed spinor and @xmath24 is its right - handed hermitian conjugate .",
