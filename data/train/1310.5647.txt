    "the impact of an attack is measured in terms of its effect on the connectivity of the network , ( e.g. , how many links fail , how many pairs of nodes get disconnected , etc . ) , and the goal is to find the location of attack that causes the maximum damage to the network .",

    "the elements in @xmath591 are chosen from @xmath57 using the 2-stage random sampling mechanism described above , which we can rearrange so that we first choose a random sample @xmath621 of segments , and then , with this choice fixed , we choose the random expansion distances .",
    "this allows us to view @xmath591 as a set of racetracks over a fixed set @xmath621 of segments , each of which is the minkowski sum of a segment of @xmath621 with a disk of a random radius , where the radii are drawn uniformly at random and independently from the set @xmath622 .",
    "there is a minor technical issue : we might choose in @xmath621 the same segment @xmath623 several times , and these copies of @xmath34 are not pairwise - disjoint . to address this issue",
    ", we slightly shift these multiple copies of @xmath34 so as to make them pairwise - disjoint . assuming that @xmath46 is in general position and that the cdfdefining @xmath88 is in `` general position '' with respect to the locations of the segments of @xmath46 , as defined in section [ sec : segs ]",
    ", this will not affect the asymptotic maximum depth in the arrangement of the sample . by corollary  [ cor : klevel ] ,",
    "applied under the densitymodel and conditioned on a fixed choice of @xmath621 , the expected value of @xmath624 is @xmath625 = o(\\delta(\\r_i)\\asize_i\\log n)=o(2^i\\log^3 n ) , \\ ] ] implying the same bound for the unconditional expectation too .",
    "the expected time spent in constructing @xmath582 by the randomized incremental algorithm in @xcite is @xmath626 expected time .",
    "summing this bound over the steps of the first phase , we conclude that the expected time spent in the first phase is @xmath627 .    in the second phase , @xmath628 and the same argument as above , using ( [ eq : approx ] )",
    ", implies that @xmath629 where the latter bound follows as @xmath630 $ ] .",
    "hence , @xmath631 , and the expected size of @xmath605 is thus @xmath632 .",
    "since this dominates the cost of the other steps in this phase , the second phase takes @xmath633 expected time .    putting everything together",
    ", we obtain that the expected running time of the procedure is @xmath633 , and it computes , with high probability , a point @xmath528 such that @xmath634 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : nva ] .",
    "we have shown that if we take the minkowski sums of the members of a family of pairwise - disjoint convex sets , each of constant description complexity , with disks whose radii are chosen using a suitable probabilistic model , then the expected complexity of the union of the minkowski sums is near linear .",
    "this generalizes the result of kedem  @xcite and shows that the complexity of the union of minkowski sums is quadratic only if the expansion distances are chosen in an adversial manner .",
    "our model is related to the so - called _ realistic input models _ , proposed to obtain more refined bounds on the performance of a variety of geometric algorithms  @xcite .",
    "there are also some similarities between our model and the framework of smoothed analysis  @xcite .",
    "a natural collection of open problems is to tighten the bounds in our theorems or prove corresponding lower bounds . in particular",
    ", the following questions arise .",
    "( i ) the @xmath635 bound of theorem [ thm : sets ] is unlikely to be tight .",
    "is it possible to prove an @xmath191 upper bound as we did for polygons in theorem  [ thm : main ] ?",
    "( ii ) can the bound in theorem  [ thm : main ] be improved from @xmath13 to @xmath636 ?",
    "( iii ) is the bound of theorem  [ thm : main ] asymptotically tight , even for segments , or could one prove a tighter @xmath637 bound ?",
    "maybe even linear ?",
    "another interesting direction for future research is to explore other problems that can benefit from our model .",
    "for example , we believe that the expected complexity of the multiplicatively - weighted voronoi diagram of a set of points in @xmath59 is near - linear if the weights are chosen using one of our models , and we plan to investigate this problem . recall that if the weights are chosen by an adversary , then the complexity is quadratic  @xcite .",
    "finally , it would be useful to prove , or disprove , that the density and permutation models are equivalent , in the sense that the value of @xmath75 is asymptotically the same under both models for any family @xmath11 of pairwise - disjoint convex sets . nevertheless , it is conceivable that there is a large class of density functions for which the densitymodel yields a better upper bound .",
