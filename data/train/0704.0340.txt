    "over the past few years , tight confinement of cold atoms has drawn considerable attention .",

    "a rigorous theory of spontaneous decay of an atom in a surface - induced potential invoking the density - matrix formalism has been developed @xcite .",
    "the role of interference between the emitted and reflected fields and also the role of transmission into the evanescent modes were identified .",
    "further calculations on the excitation spectrum have been carried out @xcite .",
    "bound - to - bound transitions were shown to lead to significant effects like a large red tail of the excitation spectrum as compared to the weak consequences of free - to - bound transitions .",
    "a crucial step in this direction was the experimental observation of the excitation spectrum and the channeling of the fluorescent photons along the nanofiber @xcite , opening up avenues for novel quantum information devices .    in most of the problems involving surface ",
    "atom interaction , the macroscopic surface is usually kept at room temperature .",
    "thus the pertinent question that can be asked is what would be the effect of heating on the cold atoms .",
    "it is understood that transfer of heat to the trapped atoms will lead to a change in the occupation probability of the vibrational levels as well as their coherence .",

    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) that transitions from shallow levels have probabilities orders of magnitude lower than those from deeper levels .",

    "the effects of the surface vibrations are weaker for the shallow levels than for the deep levels .",
    "another pertinent feature that should be noted from the figure is the following : since transition frequencies involved are large , they may overshoot the debye frequency @xmath236 thz , leading to a cutoff on the lower ( higher ) side of the frequency axis for the emission ( absorption ) curve .    in order to see the overall effect of the individual transition rates shown above , we add them up .",

    "however , the desorption rate is substantial ( above @xmath265 s@xmath15 ) for intermediate and shallow levels .",
    "thus , the total phonon - absorption rate @xmath261 is mainly determined by the bound - to - bound transitions in the case of deep levels and by the bound - to - free transitions in the case of shallow levels .",
    "one of the reasons for the dramatic reduction of the bound - to - bound phonon - absorption rate in the region of shallow levels is that the number of upper bound levels @xmath0 becomes small .",
    "the second reason is that the frequency of each individual transition becomes small , leading to a decrease of the phonon mode density .",
    "the third reason is that the center - of - mass wave functions of shallow levels are spread far away from the surface , leading to a reduction of the effect of phonons on the atom .",
    "unlike the bound - to - bound phonon - absorption rate , the bound - to - free phonon - absorption rate is substantial in the region of shallow levels .",
    "this is because the free - state spectrum is continuous and the range of the bound - to - free transition frequency can be large ( up to the debye frequency @xmath236 thz ) .",
    "the gradual reduction of the bound - to - free phonon - absorption rate in the region of shallow levels is mainly due to the reduction of the time that the atom spends in the proximity of the surface .    the total phonon - emission rate @xmath266 [ see eq .",
