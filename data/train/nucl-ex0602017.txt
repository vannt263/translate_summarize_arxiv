    "theoretical treatments and applications of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force at low and intermediate energies have progressed considerably in sophistication through the past decade .",
    "partial wave analyses and potential model fits to the nn scattering database have incorporated explicit allowance for breaking of isospin ( @xmath1 ) symmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ , by removing constraints that previously required equal @xmath2 phase shifts for the pp and np systems , and have been used to constrain the pion - nucleon - nucleon coupling constant @xcite .",
    "effective field theory approaches @xcite have become competitive with more traditional meson - exchange models of the interaction , in terms of the quality of fit provided to the database and the number of adjustable parameters employed , while holding out the promise of providing internally consistent two- and three - nucleon forces from the same theory .",
    "striking success has been achieved in _ ab initio _ calculations of the structure of light nuclei @xcite by combining phenomenological three - nucleon forces with nn interactions taken without modification from fits to the nn scattering database .",
    "an important aspect in these advances has been the approach toward consensus on which measurements should be included in an nn database to which conventional @xmath3 optimization techniques can be sensibly applied .",
    "the rejection of specific , allegedly flawed , experiments from the database has not been without controversy . in the present paper ,",
    "we report detailed results from a new np scattering experiment addressing one of the most prominent of these controversies .",
    "discrepancies among different experiments have led to a drastic pruning of cross section measurements for intermediate - energy np scattering .",
    "for example , the said partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of the np database @xcite rejects more than 40% of all measured cross sections in the range 100 - 300 mev in neutron laboratory kinetic energy .",
    "the rejected fraction is even larger in the nijmegen pwa @xcite , especially so for scattering at center - of - mass angles beyond 90@xmath4 .",
    "the rejected data include nearly all of the most recent experiments , carried out by groups at uppsala @xcite and freiburg @xcite .",
    "the problems are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xscomp ] by the comparison of data from these two groups with earlier los alamos measurements @xcite that dominate the medium - energy back - angle cross section data retained in the database .",
    "clear differences among these data sets are seen in the shape of the angular distribution .",
    "other differences , reflecting the general experimental difficulty in determining the absolute scale for neutron - induced cross sections , are masked in the figure by renormalization factors that have been applied in the partial wave analyses .",
    "removal of the uppsala and freiburg data , which exhibit fairly similar angular dependences , begs the question of whether the @xmath3 criterion used to reject them @xcite may subtly bias the pwa results toward agreement with older measurements that might have had their own unrecognized systematic errors .",
    "the np back - angle cross section discrepancies have been highlighted in debates concerning the value and extraction methods for the charged @xmath5nn coupling constant @xmath6 ( in the notation of pseudovector formulations of the interaction , or equivalently @xmath7 in pseudoscalar formulations ) @xcite .",
    "np scattering pwa s appear to determine this basic parameter of the nn force well : _",
    "e.g. _ , the nijmegen analysis @xcite yields @xmath8 ( equivalent to @xmath9 ) , and the authors claim that the constraints are imposed by the entire database , with no particularly enhanced sensitivity to any specific observable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , ericson _",
    "have extracted a significantly higher coupling constant , consistent with older  textbook \" values ( @xmath10 ) , by applying controversial pole extrapolation techniques to the uppsala back - angle np scattering cross sections alone @xcite .",
    "while much debate has centered on the rigor of the pole extrapolation method @xcite , it is clear that the discrepancy in coupling constant values arises in large part @xcite from the cross section discrepancies between the uppsala measurements and the  accepted \" database .",
    "an experimental resolution of these discrepancies is highly desirable , especially if a new experiment can also pin down the absolute cross section scale .",
    "bugg and machleidt have pointed out @xcite that the largest uncertainty in their determination of @xmath6 is associated with the normalization of np differential cross sections , which are often allowed to float from the claimed normalization in individual experiments by 10% or more in pwa s .",
    "in contrast , the nijmegen group claims @xcite that , despite sizable normalization uncertainties in existing elastic scattering data , precise total cross section measurements fix the np absolute cross section scale to @xmath11 accuracy .",
    "this claim could also be checked by a new experiment that provides good experimental precision on absolute differential cross sections .    in the present paper",
    "we report detailed results from such a new experiment , designed to resolve these np back - angle cross section discrepancies .",
    "the experiment employed techniques completely independent of those used in other medium - energy measurements , in order to provide tight control over systematic errors .",
    "a tagged neutron beam @xcite centered around 194 mev kinetic energy bombarded carefully matched , large - volume ch@xmath12 and c targets , which permitted accurate subtraction of backgrounds from quasifree scattering and other sources .",
    "the bombarding energy range was chosen to match approximately that used in earlier high - precision np scattering polarization measurements from the indiana university cyclotron facility ( iucf ) @xcite .",
    "recoil protons from np scattering were identified in a detector array of sufficient angular coverage to measure the differential cross section at all c.m .",
    "angles beyond 90@xmath4 simultaneously .",
    "the tagging allows accurate determination of the absolute scattering probability for the analyzed subset of all neutrons incident on a secondary target , but it also offers a host of other , less obvious , advantages important to a precise experiment : ( 1 ) accurate relative normalization of data taken with ch@xmath12 _ vs. _ c targets ; ( 2 ) event - by - event determination of neutron energy , impact point and incidence angle on the secondary target , with the latter measurement being especially important for cross section measurements very near 180@xmath4 c.m .",
    "scattering angle ; ( 3 ) three - dimensional location of background sources displaced from the secondary target @xcite ; ( 4 ) precise measurement of the detector acceptance for np scattering events ; ( 5 ) methods to tag np scattering event subsamples that should yield identical cross section results but different sensitivity to various sources of systematic error .",
    "the tagging was thus essential to the entire approach of the experiment ; no _ extra _ work was required to extract _ absolute _ cross sections , and thereby to provide an important calibration standard for medium - energy neutron - induced reactions .",
    "the basic results of this experiment have recently been reported briefly @xcite . in the present paper we provide more detail on the comparison of results to pwa s , on the data analysis procedures and on the evaluation and characterization of systematic uncertainties .",
    "such details are important for resolving the sort of discrepancies that have plagued the np database .",
    "partial wave analyses should , in principle , incorporate experimental systematic as well as statistical errors in optimizing fits to data from a wide variety of experiments . in order to do so",
    ", they must have access to clear delineations of which errors affect only the overall normalization , which have angle - dependence and , in the latter case , what the degree of correlation is among errors at different angles .",
    "overall systematic uncertainties in the absolute cross sections reported here average @xmath13 , with a slight angle - dependence detailed herein .",
    "statistical uncertainties in the measurements are in the range @xmath14 in each of 15 angle bins .",
    "the experiment was carried out in the iucf cooler ring @xcite , with apparatus ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) installed in a ring section where the primary stored proton beam was bent by 6@xmath4 .",
    "a primary electron - cooled unpolarized proton beam of 202.5 mev kinetic energy and typical circulating current of 12 ma was stored in the ring .",
    "neutrons of 185 - 197 mev were produced via the charge - exchange reaction p+d",
    "@xmath15 n+2p when the proton beam passed through a windowless internal deuterium gas jet target ( gjt ) of typical thickness @xmath16 atoms/@xmath17 .",
    "the ultra - thin target permitted detection of the two associated low - energy recoil protons from the production reaction in double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dssd s ) comprising the  tagger \" .",
    "measurements of energy , arrival time and two - dimensional position for both recoil protons in the tagger , when combined with the precise knowledge of cooled primary proton beam direction and energy , allowed four - momentum determination for each tagged neutron on an event - by - event basis . during the measurement periods ,",
    "the stored proton beam was operated in  coasting \" mode , with rf bunching turned off to minimize the ratio of accidental to real two - proton coincidences in the tagger .",
    "the proton beam energy was then maintained by velocity matching ( induced naturally by mutual electromagnetic interactions ) to the collinear electron beam in the beam cooling section of the ring .",
    "details of the layout , design and performance of the tagger detectors and of the forward detector array used to view np scattering events from the secondary target are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we summarize the salient features briefly . the tagger included an array of four 6.4@xmath186.4 @xmath17 dssd s with 480 @xmath19 m readout pitch in two orthogonal ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) directions , each followed by a silicon pad (  backing \" ) detector ( bd ) of the same area .",
    "the dssd s were positioned about 10 cm away from the center of the gas jet production target .",
    "each dssd had 128 @xmath20 and 128 @xmath21 readout channels .",
    "readout was accomplished with front - end application - specific integrated circuits ( asic s ) that provided both timing and energy information @xcite .",
    "the timing signals provided to external electronics consisted of the logical or over groups of 32 adjacent channels of leading - edge discriminator signals based on fast shaped and amplified analog signals generated in the asic s .",
    "the timing signals available from @xmath22 logical pixels for each dssd permitted operation of the tagger in a self - triggering mode , where the time - consuming digitization of slow pulse height signals from all 1024 dssd channels could be initiated by logic based solely on the tagger hit pattern , as reconstructed from the fast timing signals .",
    "this self - triggering was critical to the determination of precise absolute cross sections , because it allowed acquisition of data to count directly the flux of tagged neutrons that did not interact in the secondary target or in any of the forward detectors .    only recoil protons that stopped either in the dssd s ( @xmath23 mev ) or bd s ( @xmath24 mev ) were considered in the data analysis , because for these the tagger provided a measurement of total kinetic energy with good resolution . by combining these energy measurements with position measurements for both recoil protons , we were able to determine the energy and angle of each tagged neutron , within their broad distributions , with respective resolutions of @xmath25 kev and @xmath26 2 mrad .",
    "as part of this determination , we reconstructed the longitudinal origin ( @xmath27 ) of each produced neutron within the extended gjt density profile with a resolution of @xmath28 2 mm , by comparing neutron momentum magnitudes inferred by applying energy conservation ( independent of vertex position ) _ vs. _ vector momentum conservation ( dependent on vertex position ) to the tagger information for the two recoil protons .",
    "similar resolution was obtained for the transverse coordinates at which each tagged neutron impinged upon a secondary scattering target ( tgt in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) positioned 1.1 m downstream of the gjt .",
    "top view of the np scattering experiment setup . ]",
    "two solid secondary targets were used during the production running : a @xmath29 @xmath30 slab of polyethylene ( ch@xmath12 ) containing @xmath31 hydrogen atoms/@xmath17 and a graphite target of known density machined to have identical transverse dimensions and the same number of carbon atoms per unit area .",
    "each target thickness was determined to @xmath32 by weighing .",
    "data were collected in 18-hour cycles , comprising 6 hours of running with the ch@xmath12 target , followed by 6 hours with c and 6 more hours with ch@xmath12 .",
    "the frequent interchange of the targets facilitated accurate background subtractions .",
    "both targets intercepted neutrons over an approximate production angle range of @xmath33 , and cuts were generally placed on the tagger information during data analysis to confine attention to tagged neutrons that would hit the secondary target .",
    "such tagged neutrons were produced at a typical rate of @xmath34 200 s@xmath35 , leading to typical free np back - scattering ( angle - integrated ) rates @xmath34 1 s@xmath35 from the ch@xmath12 target .",
    "protons emerging from the secondary target were detected in a forward array of plastic scintillators for triggering and energy information , and a set of ( three - plane ) multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpcs ) for tracking , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the plastic scintillators included large upstream veto ( luv ) and small upstream veto ( suv ) counters to reject charged particles produced upstream of the secondary target .",
    "the @xmath36e scintillator was separated from the secondary target by a mwpc to permit easy discrimination against np scattering events initiated in that scintillator .",
    "the rear hodoscope comprised 20 plastic scintillator bars @xcite of sufficient thickness ( 20 cm ) to stop 200 mev protons and give 15 - 20% detection efficiency for 100 - 200 mev neutrons .",
    "all forward detectors were rectangular in transverse profile , with the rear mwpc and hodoscope spanning a considerably larger vertical than horizontal acceptance .",
    "the entire forward array provided essentially 100% ( @xmath37 ) geometric acceptance for np scattering events initiated at the ch@xmath12 target for angles @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . for c.m .",
    "angles forward of 90@xmath4 the large size and significant neutron detection efficiency of the hodoscope provided a small efficiency for detecting forward - scattered neutrons in coincidence with larger - angle protons that fired at least the first two mwpcs .",
    "the tagger and forward detector array were designed to facilitate a kinematically complete double - scattering experiment with a first target giving negligible energy loss . with the same apparatus ,",
    "a similar measurement of pp scattering was possible simultaneously .",
    "for this purpose one could use the tagger to detect a single large - angle recoil deuteron instead of two recoil protons , in order to tag a secondary proton beam via pd elastic scattering in the gjt . by requiring a coincidence between a single hit in the tagger and a signal from the small upstream veto scintillator ( suv in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , we could define a secondary proton beam of very similar transverse dimensions to the tagged neutron beam .",
    "another scintillator ( veto2 ) placed just in front of the rear hodoscope allowed us to distinguish , at trigger level , between protons from pd elastic scattering that traversed the forward array without further nuclear interactions and protons that scattered out of this secondary beam in material following suv . in the present paper",
    ", we discuss only the former group , as their yield provides an accurate relative normalization of runs taken with the ch@xmath12 _ vs. _ c targets .",
    "the triggered events of interest for the present analysis were recorded in four mutually exclusive event streams , three for tagged neutron candidates ( consistent with two distinct tagger hits and no accompanying signals from luv or suv ) and one for tagged proton candidates ( consistent with a single tagger hit in prompt coincidence with both luv and suv ) .",
    "the trigger logic defined these event streams as follows : ( 1 ) tagged neutrons with no rear hodoscope coincidence , providing a prescaled ( by a factor of 20 ) sample for neutron flux monitoring ; ( 2 ) @xmath40 scattering candidates for which a tagged neutron was in coincidence with signals from both the @xmath36e scintillator and the rear hodoscope ; ( 3 ) tagged neutrons in coincidence with the hodoscope but _ not _ with the @xmath36e scintillator , a sample used for evaluating the neutron detection efficiency of the hodoscope @xcite ; ( 4 ) tagged protons in coincidence with both the @xmath36e and veto2 scintillators , providing a prescaled ( by a factor of 10 ) sample including pd elastic scattering events from the gjt , used to cross - normalize c and ch@xmath12 secondary target runs .",
    "the total flux of tagged neutrons intercepting the secondary target was determined from a sum over event streams ( 1)+(2)+(3 ) , while comparative analyses of the three streams facilitated crosschecks to calibrate the system @xcite and aid understanding of potential systematic errors .",
    "the general philosophy of the data analysis was to define properties of the tagged neutron beam by identical cuts applied to event streams ( 1)-(3 ) , so that associated systematic uncertainties would cancel in the yield ratios from which the absolute np scattering cross section is extracted . among these common cuts , described in more detail below , were ones to remove bd noise contributions correlated among the four quadrants of the tagger , to identify the recoil particles detected in the tagger , and to divide the tagged neutron events into subsamples for subsequent analysis .",
    "additional cuts defined a fiducial range for the tagged neutron s predicted transverse coordinates at the secondary target ( @xmath419.5 cm and @xmath429.5 cm ) , and selected prompt tagger two - particle coincidences ( @xmath43 ns , where @xmath44 is the arrival time of the recoil proton with the larger ( smaller ) dssd energy deposition ) .",
    "software cuts applied to event stream ( 2 ) alone to identify free np scattering events were kept to a minimum in order to avoid complicated systematic errors .",
    "we relied instead on the accuracy of the background subtractions , which could be verified to high precision . before application of cuts ,",
    "additional mwpc requirements were added in software to amplify the hardware definitions of the various triggers .",
    "thus , at least one hit in the @xmath45-plane and at least one hit in the @xmath46-plane were required for each of the three mwpc s for events from stream 2 .",
    "the correlation of dssd vs. bd energy depositions was used to select two basic event classes for analysis of each of the three tagged neutron event streams : ( a ) `` 2-stop '' events , where both protons associated with the neutron stopped inside the dssd ( either the same or different quadrants of the tagger ) ; and ( b ) `` 1-punch '' events , where one of the protons stopped inside a dssd and the other punched through to the bd in a different quadrant and stopped there . these two classes , as discussed further below , differ significantly in neutron energy ( @xmath47 ) and position ( @xmath48 ) profiles , allowing an important crosscheck on the accuracy of the tagging technique by comparing np cross sections extracted independently from each class .",
    "the 2-stop events were further subdivided according to whether the higher of the two recoil proton dssd energy depositions ( @xmath49 ) was below or above 5.0 mev . protons with @xmath50 mev range out near the exit of the dssd , and hence possibly in dead layers at the back of the dssd or front of the bd , making this event class subject to somewhat greater ambiguity regarding complete recoil proton energy reconstruction and accuracy of the predicted @xmath48 value for the tagged neutron",
    ". events where both protons punched through to the bd s , or where either punched through the bd itself , were not included in the analysis because they corresponded to @xmath47 below the range of interest .",

    "figure  [ fig : pid ] shows raw spectra for both tagged neutrons ( event stream 1 in frame ( b ) ) and tagged protons ( event stream 4 in frame ( a ) ) of the energy deposited in a typical dssd quadrant vs. that in the companion bd when the latter is non - zero .",
    "the tagged proton events exhibit clear recoil proton ( lower ) and deuteron ( upper ) particle identification loci , while only the proton locus remains for tagged neutron events .",
    "the loci bend backwards when the detected particle begins to punch through the bd .",
    "the two - dimensional gate ( dark boundary ) shown in each frame was used to select recoil protons that enter and stop inside the bd , _",
    "e.g. _ , to identify the 1-punch tagged neutron events . note that the most intense region along the proton locus , corresponding to deuteron breakup events with an energetic large - angle proton , is thereby eliminated .",
    "so are events lying off the proton locus , where the backing detector response may be corrupted by noise or pileup .",
    "figure  [ fig : enxtag ] shows the reconstructed @xmath47 and @xmath48 distributions for the tagged neutrons in the 2-stop ( for all values of @xmath49 ) vs. 1-punch samples .",
    "while the two samples yield overlapping distributions , it is clear that the 1-punch events correspond on average to lower - energy neutrons at larger production angles ( preferentially populating the beam - right side of the secondary target ) .",
    "special care was taken in the definitions of 1-punch and 2-stop events to minimize effects of substantial detector noise picked up by the large - capacitance bd s .",
    "an important source of this noise was discovered to arise from the initiation of pulse height information readout on the adjacent dssd front - end electronics @xcite .",
    "the induced noise was strongly correlated among the four bd s , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornoise ] .",
    "this figure reveals two uncorrelated bands parallel to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes , due to 1-punch events in one of the quadrants and low pulse - height noise in the other ( the pedestals for each bd appear in adc channel @xmath2810 ) .",
    "but one also observes a strong diagonal band indicative of noise correlations between the two quadrants .",
    "the adc outputs of two bd s plotted against one another , revealing regions of 1-punch tagged neutron events , but also a region dominated by correlated noise in both quadrants .",
    "events along the @xmath45- and @xmath46-axes , where one bd signal falls in the pedestal region , are also mostly valid 1-punch events . ]    since the noise correlation pattern extends beyond a reasonable software threshold , it was necessary to use a two - dimensional gate , such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornoise ] , to bound the noise correlation region .",
    "candidates for valid 1-punch events were then required to : ( 1 ) surpass a threshold adc channel ( @xmath2815 ) on at least one bd ; ( 2 ) fall outside the noise correlation gates for all bd pairs ; ( 3 ) not surpass the bd noise peak ( adc @xmath2870 ) in more than one bd ; and ( 4 ) fall within the pid gate in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid ] for the appropriate quadrant . these conditions and",
    "the complementary ones required for 2-stop events reduced the flux of tagged neutrons considered for subsequent analysis , by removing events with bd pulse height ambiguities , but since they were applied equally to all tagged neutron event streams , they did not introduce systematic errors in the np cross section extraction .",
    "an event misidentification mechanism discovered during the data analysis was attributed to an electronics malfunction in the gating or clearing circuit for the electronics module that was used to digitize the pulse height information for all four bd s .",
    "the effect of the malfunction was to zero out valid bd energy signals for a randomly selected fraction of punch - through events .",
    "the effect was seen clearly , for example , in the pd elastic scattering events in stream 4 , where a software gate placed on the two - body kinematic correlation between recoil deuteron dssd energy deposition and forward proton angle could be used to select events in which the deuteron must have stopped in the bd .",
    "roughly 3/4 of these events showed the anticipated bd pulse height , but 1/4 had @xmath51 .",
    "in the case of tagged neutrons , the corrupted events were misidentified as 2-stop events and gave systematically incorrect predictions of the tagged neutron trajectory , since some recoil proton energy was lost .",
    "however , the availability of full information for the surviving punch - through samples allowed us to emulate the effect and subtract the corrupted events accurately .",
    "the corrupted events were easily distinguished in event stream 2 by using the mwpc tracking information . figure  [ fig : tail1 ] shows the correlation for event stream 2 between @xmath49 in the tagger and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the transverse coordinate of the detected proton from np scattering at the secondary target , as reconstructed from the mwpc hits .",
    "the majority of events have @xmath54 , independent of @xmath49 , as expected when both the tagging and tracking are accurate .",
    "the corrupted events populate the `` tail '' to the left of the most intense band , with @xmath48 exceeding @xmath53 by an amount that is strongly correlated with the recoil proton energy deposition in the dssd : the lower @xmath49 , the larger is the lost @xmath55 and the consequent error in @xmath48 . while the corrupted events could be eliminated from event stream 2 by a software gate within fig .",
    "[ fig : tail1 ] , they could not have been similarly eliminated from event streams 1 and 3 , where there was no forward proton to track .",

    "[ seqreac ] ) at @xmath61 cm .",

    "software conditions imposed only on event stream 2 to distinguish free - scattering from background events have the potential to remove free - scattering yield in sometimes subtle ways .",
    "they were thus used in the analysis only when they could substantially reduce the statistical uncertainties ( _ i.e. _ , by suppressing background to be subtracted ) without introducing significant systematic uncertainties in correcting for the free - scattering losses , or when such losses were judged to be inevitable to remove ambiguities in the analysis .",
    "the accuracy of the c background subtraction provided a reliable method to judge the extent of any free - scattering event removal .",
    "the most effective such cut applied was placed on the correlation of forward proton energy loss in the @xmath70 scintillator with the laboratory angle of the proton trajectory .",
    "the applied two - dimensional software gate is superimposed on the observed distribution of events following ch@xmath12 - c subtraction in fig .",
    "[ fig : syserr_ii.f ] .",
    "this distribution reveals that very few free - scattering events were removed by this gate , but it is clear from the long tail seen in the projected unsubtracted spectrum for one angle bin in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkgrnd](c ) that a substantial number of quasifree background events , leading to lower - energy outgoing protons , were successfully removed .    the distribution of np scattering candidate events after subtraction of c from ch@xmath12 data with respect to @xmath70 adc and proton lab angle .",
    "the red lines show the boundaries of the gate applied to event stream 2 to select free scattering events . ]    in contrast , we did not apply a comparable cut on the energy deposition of the forward proton in the rear hodoscope , where it generally stopped , despite an appreciable difference in the distributions of hodoscope energy between free and quasifree events .",
    "the reason for avoiding this cut is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : syserr_ii.d ] : the free - scattering spectrum revealed by the c subtraction exhibits a quite substantial low - energy reaction tail in addition to the well - defined full - energy peak .",
    "an unacceptably large systematic error would have been introduced by the need to correct for loss of these reaction tail events , if we had imposed a cut on hodoscope energy to suppress background .",
    "the distribution of np free scattering events in the scattering angle bin @xmath73 with respect to forward proton energy deposition in the rear hodoscope .",
    "the curve represents a fit with a gaussian plus exponential tail .",
    "the tail represents valid free scattering events where the proton undergoes a nuclear reaction in the stopping scintillator . ]    a benign cut imposed for slight background reduction placed an upper threshold on the @xmath3 value obtained for a linear track fit to the reconstructed mwpc space points .",
    "the ch@xmath12 - c subtraction indicates that only @xmath74 of free - scattering events were removed by this condition .",
    "more serious ( 6.3% of total ch@xmath12 - c yield ) , but unavoidable , losses were introduced by cuts confining the tagging and tracking information in event stream 2 to agree within @xmath75 cm and @xmath76 cm .",
    "these limits correspond to @xmath77 of the narrow gaussian resolution function that dominates these distributions in the ch@xmath12 - c spectra .",
    "nonetheless , the cut eliminates events in long distribution tails that are affected either by tagging errors or sequential reactions of the tagged neutron , which introduce serious ambiguities in interpretation .",
    "this cut , and its consequence for systematic uncertainties , will be discussed further in sec .",
    "[ seqreac ] .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning one additional cut that we chose _ not _ to impose .",
    "the transverse np vertex coordinates are , in fact , determined by the tagging and tracking with considerably better resolution than implied by the @xmath78 mm value mentioned in the preceding paragraph @xcite .",
    "this latter value is dominated by the thickness of the secondary target , simply reflecting the uncertainty in precise longitudinal origin of the np scattering vertex .",
    "much better information is , in principle , available by locating the vertex in three dimensions at the point of closest approach of the neutron trajectory reconstructed from the tagger and the proton trajectory reconstructed from the mwpc s",
    ". distributions of such reconstructed secondary vertex coordinates @xcite permit tagged neutron radiography of the background sources displaced from the ch@xmath12 target .",
    "however , any cuts to remove such background sources in this manner would be affected by the strong dependence of the reconstructed vertex resolution on the proton scattering angle ( vertex information clearly deteriorates as the neutron and proton trajectories approach collinearity ) .",
    "we decided to rely completely on the c subtraction to remove such other sources of background , in order to avoid consequent angle - dependent free - scattering event losses .",
    "the lab - frame proton scattering angle @xmath79 is determined for each analyzed event as the opening angle between the neutron trajectory reconstructed from the tagger and the forward proton trajectory reconstructed from the mwpc s .",
    "the geometric acceptance of the forward detector array for np scattering events is a function of both @xmath79 and the coordinates of the scattering vertex at the secondary target . because the distribution of scattering vertex coordinates , especially of @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : enxtag ] ) , differed among the three analyzed data subsamples ( 1-punch , 2-stop with @xmath80 mev , and 2-stop with @xmath50 mev ) , the acceptance had to be evaluated separately for each subsample .",
    "this was done by comparing simulated to measured distributions of events with respect to azimuthal angle @xmath81 within each @xmath79 bin , for each data subsample .",
    "the simulations were constrained to reproduce the measured distributions of the longitudinal production vertex coordinate of the neutron within the gjt ( common to all three data subsamples ) and its transverse coordinates on the secondary target ( separately for each subsample ) . within these distributions , coordinates were generated randomly for each event , as were also @xmath82 ( in the range 075@xmath4 ) and @xmath81 ( over the full azimuthal range ) .",
    "generated outgoing proton trajectories were then accepted if they would yield signals above the hodoscope pulse height threshold ( required in trigger ) and in all three mwpc s ( required in the data analysis ) .",
    "forward detector location parameters were tuned slightly from their measured values to optimize the fit of the simulated to the measured @xmath81 distributions for all @xmath79 bins and for 1-punch and 2-stop samples simultaneously .",

    "the structure reflects the rectangular shape of the hodoscope and large mwpc , projected onto @xmath85 space : _",
    "e.g. _ , the four peaks observed correspond to the four detector corners .",
    "the small changes in distribution between the 1-punch and 2-stop samples  _ e.g. _ , in the relative heights of the peaks and in the extent of the dips near @xmath86 ( beam left side ) and 180@xmath4 ( beam right )  arise from the shift in @xmath48 profiles seen in fig .  [",

    "the preceding section provided a detailed catalogue of the issues that must be carefully controlled to measure precise absolute cross sections with medium - energy neutron beams . to our knowledge",
    ", no previous experiments have attempted a comparable degree of control .",
    "the best existing absolute neutron - induced cross section standards at intermediate energies are from attenuation measurements of total cross sections @xcite , which are not suitable for calibrating neutron fluxes .",
    "it is hoped that the present results will provide a new calibration standard .",
    "the excellent agreement of our experimentally determined absolute cross section scale with that given by the nijmegen pwa93 solution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : avexs ] ) confirms the consistency of our results with the total cross section measurements .",
    "the level of agreement of our measurements with pwa s at @xmath98 mev is presented in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsdif ] .",
    "here it is seen that , while the absolute cross section scale of the experimental results is in very good agreement with the nijmegen pwa93 solution , there is a small systematic deviation in angular shape between the two : our results are higher than pwa93 by 23% for @xmath99 and lower by a similar amount for @xmath100 .",
    "these deviations considerably exceed our estimated systematic uncertainty in the angle - dependence . in particular , we note that the forward detector acceptance used in the former angle range is already essentially 100% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance2 ] ) , so that the extracted cross section can not be overestimated by virtue of underestimating acceptance .",
    "furthermore , the results for the three independently analyzed data samples agree extremely well in this angle region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : com1pn2s ] ) .",
    "we do see a possible small , statistically marginal , systematic deviation among our three data samples in fig .",
    "[ fig : com1pn2s ] over the angle region from 100 to 130@xmath4 , with the 1-punch cross sections falling on average a few % below those for the two 2-stop event samples .",
    "however , even if this difference reflects a real systematic problem , it could only pull the averaged cross section down by less than 0.5% in this region , too small to account for the deviation from pwa93 in fig .  [",
    "fig : xsdif ] .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsdif ] the relative differential cross section differences between two recent said pwa solutions @xcite and the nijmegen pwa93 .",
    "the various pwa solutions differ from one another by as much as 23% also in the angle region displayed .",
    "furthermore , we note that the said solution has shifted by @xmath342% after inclusion of the present results in the fitted np database ( even though that inclusion was carried out by adding our full , mostly angle - independent , systematic uncertainties in quadrature with our statistical uncertainties , thereby under - weighting the present data in the fit ) .",
    "we conclude that the deviations between the present results and pwa93 are of the same order as the present uncertainties in the pwa solutions , and most likely point to the need to refit phase shifts .",
    "we note , however , that there is a conceptual flaw in the procedures for such refitting to a database where all experiments have systematic uncertainties , but there is considerable variability in the level at which those systematic uncertainties are reported in the literature .",
    "finally , we address the comparison of the present results with those from the recent experiments by the uppsala @xcite and freiburg @xcite groups , both of which have been rejected from the np database used in the nijmegen and said pwa s . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : avexs ] by the comparison of the two experimental results with pwa curves at the respective energies of the experiments , the present results deviate systematically from those of @xcite in the steepness of the back - angle rise in cross section .",
    "these deviations are larger than the differences anticipated from the difference in neutron energy between the two experiments .",
    "there is a similar , though not quite as pronounced , systematic deviation of the present results from those of franz , _",
    "@xcite , shown in fig .  [ fig : xscomp ] .",
    "it is difficult to say definitively whether there might be a common problem that caused excessive cross sections near @xmath101 in both of these earlier , completely independent and quite different , experiments .",
    "we note only that measurements near @xmath102 , where the solid angle is vanishing , can be tricky with a secondary neutron beam of sizable angular divergence .",
    "one of the great advantages of the use of a tagged beam is that we are able in the present experiment to determine the neutron incidence angle event by event .",
    "we thereby see that an angle bin near @xmath103 with respect to the _ central _ neutron direction in fact includes important contributions from @xmath104 ( so that @xmath105 for the bin in eq .",
    "[ diffcrosssec ] exceeds @xmath106 ) , arising from neutrons deviating from the central beam direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsnoninc ] we compare the present results with those we would have extracted if we had chosen to ignore the neutron incidence angle information from the tagger in reconstructing the np scattering angle event by event .",
    "such neglect is seen to give rise to a systematic overestimate of the cross section at the largest angles by @xmath107 , comparable to the systematic deviations of the results in refs .   from those of the present experiment .",
    "( it also leads to a substantial underestimate near @xmath108 , where the yield is falling rapidly with increasing @xmath109 , due to detector acceptance edges . )",
    "the effect would differ for different experiments , depending on the angular profile of the neutron beam , including any effects from scattering off collimator edges ( the present experiment used no collimators ) .    the effect on the present analysis of neglecting tagger information about the neutron incidence angle in the reconstruction of the np scattering angle for each event .",
    "the closed circles represent the final results , while the open squares are those when the scattering angle is estimated only with respect to the central neutron beam direction .",
    "note the suppressed zero on the cross section scale . ]",
    "a tagged intermediate - energy neutron beam produced at the iucf cooler ring has facilitated a measurement of the np scattering differential cross section at 194 mev bombarding energy to an absolute precision @xmath110 over the c.m .",
    "angular range 90@xmath4 - 180@xmath4 .",
    "the usage of carefully matched and frequently interchanged solid ch@xmath12 and c secondary targets permitted an accurate background subtraction , reducing reliance on kinematic cuts that might have introduced larger systematic uncertainties .",
    "the internal consistency in both magnitude and angular shape of the cross sections extracted from independent data samples characterized by substantially different neutron beam spatial and energy profiles supports the accuracy of the tagging technique .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the measurement , affecting both the overall absolute scale of the cross sections and the angular dependence , have been carefully delineated , often via auxiliary measurements and analyses .",
    "the present results are in reasonable agreement with the nijmegen pwa93 calculation , over the full angular range covered , although there are systematic deviations at the 23% level in the angular dependence that might be removed by minor tuning of phase shifts . in contrast , the present results deviate systematically from other recent measurements @xcite , especially in the steepness of the back - angle cross section rise .",
    "our results thus appear to validate the omission of these earlier experiments from the database used in partial - wave analyses of np elastic scattering , while also suggesting a possible experimental cause of the earlier overestimates of the cross section near @xmath101 . as the back - angle rise",
    "is particularly influential in pole extrapolations that have occasionally been used @xcite to extract the charged pion - nucleon - nucleon coupling constant @xmath111 , the present data also bear on that coupling strength .",
    "since our measurements at the largest angles are consistent with , or even slightly less steep than , the pwa93 solution , a valid pole extrapolation analysis of the present results should yield a coupling constant value no larger than that ( @xmath112 ) extracted from the nijmegen pwa @xcite .",
