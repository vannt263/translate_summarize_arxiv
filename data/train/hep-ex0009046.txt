    "the branching ratio for the decay @xmath0 was first calculated by inami and lin @xcite as an isospin rotation from @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement of the branching ratio of @xmath0 alone will allow one to obtain the magnitude of @xmath4 , the element in the cabbibo kobayashi maskawa matrix , which controls standard model cp violation .",
    "in conjunction with the neutral channel decay @xmath5 and measurements in the b sector , this will provide an overconstrained measurement of both the real and the imaginary part of @xmath4 .",
    "this will address the question on cp violation : can it be completely accounted for by the standard model .",
    "figure  [ phys ] illustrates the proposed sensitivity of various experiments that will measure @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the cp violating parameters of the standard model .    the standard model predicts a branching ratio for the decay of @xmath8\\bullet 10^{-10}$ ] in buras s unitarity triangle @xcite .",
    "one event has been observed by the bnl experiment e787 in a stopped @xmath9 experiment .",
    "we propose @xcite to measure the decay in flight of @xmath0 and obtain @xmath1070 events in 2 years of data taking .",
    "this will meet the precision suggested by the theory .",
    "an intermediate stage , the observation of 5 - 10 events , is the goal of an approved bnl experiment e949 , which is the continuation of e787 . some members of the ckm and e949 are now working in collaboration with each other as two stages of a physics program .",
    "one of the challenges of the experiment is to control the background which is 10 orders of magnitude larger than the expected signal .",
    "this decay , with branching ratio @xmath1 21% , can mimic the signal if the two @xmath12 from the decay of the @xmath13 are undetected .",
    "it will be controlled by a combination of kinematic rejection and a photon veto system .",
    "the ckm detector must veto photons with a very high efficiency .      in this decay , with a branching ratio @xmath163.5%",
    ", the @xmath15 can be misidentified as a @xmath16 .this is controlled by a muon veto and rich systems .",
    "the interactions of the undecayed beam or daughter @xmath16s contribute to the background . in order to minimize this contribution , as little material as possible",
    "should be encountered by the particles .",
    "this dictates the choice of the various detector elements .",
    "in figure  [ app ] are shown the detector elements which will be detailed below . to detect @xmath9 hadronic interactions before the decay volume entrance , a hadron calorimeter surrounding the beam ( not described)is used .      the charged particles in the reaction , namely the k and the @xmath16 are both measured by ring imaging cherenkov counters ( rich ) as velocity vectors and as momentum vectors in upstream and downstream spectrometers .",
    "the gas in the pion rich is chosen in order to meet the low dispersion required for good resolution . in order to allow as little material in the beam as possible",
    "rather thin mirrors and windows are mandatory .",
    "this require the richs to operate at or near atmospheric pressure .",
    "these considerations have contributed to the choice of the k beam to be 22gev energy and the radiator gas of the decay pion rich to be neon .",
    "the @xmath16 momentum resolution achieved by the rich is better than 1% for this configuration .",
    "the k and @xmath16 magnetic spectrometers use conventional trackers , silicon strips and straw tubes respectively .",
    "straws have been chosen to minimize the material in the beam .",
    "they are 5 mm in diameter with a 20 @xmath15 m sense wire , 5 to 8 straw layers per station ( x , y , u , v ) .",
    "@xmath17 @xmath18 , with 150@xmath15 m hit resolution per layer .",
    "the straws are located in the vacuum decay volume .      as already mentioned",
    "one of the main tasks of the experiment is to control the background from the @xmath11 decay .",
    "this points to the extreme importance of the @xmath12 veto system .",
    "the veto system has a component surrounding the decay volume , where the decay takes place and a forward component , after the @xmath16 rich to deal with high energy @xmath12 s .",
    "we want to minimize interactions which are an important component of the non - gaussian tails of the background .",
    "therefore , the component surrounding the decay volume will be located inside the vacuum vessel with a vacuum of @xmath19 torr and we call this vacuum veto system ( vvs ) .",
    "the vvs is made of a sandwich of plastic scintillator and lead 5mm/1 mm each , stacked in modules 50 cm long and 40 cm radially .",
    "there are over 80 such sandwich layers per module and 34 such modules in the vvs .",
    "there is a void of 50 cm between each module which corresponds to an angle of incidence of @xmath20 degrees for @xmath12 .",
    "this angle is not reached by the photons coming from the @xmath21 decay kinematics .",
    "this allows us to reduce the volume and the cost by a factor two .",
    "the required vvs detection inefficiency is given in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "in the region of medium energies the requirements have been achieved by e787 with a comparable veto system .    for the forward veto system ( fvs )",
    "a choice of various techniques are avalaible , and are still under study .",
    "we are assuming , for the moment , a setup of sc / pb 5mm/1 mm sandwiches for this calorimeter as well .",
    "another important component of the background is the @xmath22 which has a branching ratio of @xmath163.5% .",
    "a muon veto follows the fvs .",
    "the non - interacting beam goes through a hole in the fvs and muon veto system and is dumped afterward by a magnetic field into the beam dump .",
    "a very important component of our experiment is the beam . in order to get @xmath1",
    "6mhz of @xmath9 decays in the fiducial volume we need a @xmath130 mhz @xmath9 beam with a ratio of @xmath23 of@xmath24 , whereas nature tends to provide far more @xmath16 s than k s , shown figure  [ pstop ] and figure  [ kdet ] .",
    "we will construct a new rf separated beam based upon 3.9 ghz transverse mode superconducting rf cavities , being developed at fermilab for this purpose .",
    "we use a set of 2 rf cavities properly spaced from each other in order for the @xmath16s to be deflected by the 1st cavity , and then deflected back by the same amount , by the 2nd cavity .",
    "the @xmath16s are absorbed by a beam stopper . with the cavities phased this way ,",
    "protons which arrive at the second cavity just one rf period behind the @xmath16s are also undeflected .",
    "ks , however , arrive @xmath25 in rf phase behind the @xmath16 and are deflected again with the same sign , causing most of them to miss the beam stopper .",
    "a cartoon of the operation is shown in figure  [ rf ] .    in figure  [ pstop ]",
    "we show the behavior of the @xmath16 component of the beam which after having been deflected back by the second cavity is stopped . shown in the same figure",
    "are the @xmath15s coming from @xmath16 decays in the beam line .    in figure  [ kdet ]",
    "the k component is shown with the decay @xmath15s .",
    "the ks which avoid the stopper are shown reaching the detector .",
    "we are in the process of building prototypes for the photon veto system , the straw tubes and the super - conducting rf cavities .",
    "simulations are being done in parallel for both the straws and the veto systems as well as for the beam line design .",
    "figure  [ mmsq ] shows the expected signal and @xmath11 background after the photon vetos have been applied from two years of running as a function of the missing mass squared of the neutral system recoiling against the @xmath26 .",
    "72 events survive in a signal region with 3 unvetoed and mismeasured @xmath11 event .",
    "the total background estimate for this sample , including @xmath22 , interactions and accidentals is @xmath27 events .",
    "work is now underway to refine and improve our proposal with the intention of seeking approval in the spring 2001 .",
