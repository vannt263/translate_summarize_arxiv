    "magnetic frustration introduces several competing states which are energetically close to each other and thereby destabilizes simple ordered states .",
    "one way to compromise two or more competing orders is to assume a helical ( spiral ) spin structure@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the high - field behavior of a spin-1/2 heisenberg model with generic interactions : @xmath2 for the simplest case with one magnetic ion per unit cell , one can easily find the classical ground state by minimizing the fourier transform of the exchange interactions : @xmath3 where the summation is taken over all @xmath4-sites connected to the @xmath5-site by @xmath6 . when @xmath7 takes its minima @xmath8 at @xmath9 , helical order with the wave number @xmath10 or @xmath11 appears ( @xmath12 are not equivalent to each other ) .",
    "when the external magnetic field is perpendicular to the spiral plane , the spiral is smoothly deformed into the so - called _ cone _ state ( fig.[fig : cone - fan ] ) and this persists until all spins eventually get polarized at the saturation field @xmath13 .",
    "when the system has an easy - plane anisotropy and the external field is applied in the spiral plane , on the other hand , the system undergoes a ( first - order ) metamagnetic transition into a coplanar _ fan _ phase@xcite .",
    "one of the simplest models which exhibit , at least in the classical limit , the helical order is a three - dimensionally coupled heisenberg chains with nearest - neighbor- ( nn ) @xmath14 and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) @xmath15 coupling . because of strong quantum fluctuation in one dimension , the spin - singlet ground state of a single decoupled @xmath16 chain can be quite different@xcite from its classical counterpart",
    ". however , it is generally expected that interchain couplings may eventually stabilize the classical helical order . in fact , many compounds which contain these 1d - chains as subsystems and display magnetic long - range orders are known ( see , for instance , table i. in ref . ) . despite this naive expectation , even relatively mild quantum fluctuations in three dimensions",
    "may destabilizes the classical ground state in some frustrated systems@xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to explore the possibility that quantum fluctuation replaces the classical cone state with other stable ones e.g. a coplanar fan .",
    "another interesting feature peculiar to the quantum case is that for a region slightly below the saturation field , we can view the emergence of various kinds of ( weak ) magnetic order as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons which enables us to use the full machinery of many - body theories@xcite .",
    "the concept of magnon bec has been successfully applied to explain various experimental results@xcite . by using dilute - bose - gas approach , batyev and braginskii@xcite discussed magnetic structure near saturation from a general point of view and concluded that this is the case if a certain condition for the bosonic interactions is satisfied .",
    "recently , helimagnetism attracts renewed interest in the context of multiferroicity@xcite and multiferroic behavior has been reported for various helimagnets .",
    "for example , a helimagnetic material licuvo@xmath17 may be viewed as coupled quantum @xmath16 @xmath0-@xmath1 chains and , as is expected from the classical theories , exhibits helical spin order@xcite and ferroelectricity@xcite simultaneously under moderate magnetic field .",
    "when the field is very high , on the other hand , this compound shows modulated collinear order@xcite , which contradicts with the aforementioned classical prediction@xcite , and this suggests that quantum fluctuation plays an important role . in these multiferroic materials , external magnetic field provides us with a way of controlling polarization@xcite and it is crucial to understand magnetic structures in high magnetic field",
    ". however , except for one - dimensional cases , only few reliable results are known for quantum systems so far .",

    "[ sec : general ] , we describe how magnon bec technique is used to determine possible magnetic structures slightly below the saturation field . our dilute bose gas approach predicts that in general there are at least three types of quantum phases ( _ cone _ , _ fan _ and an attraction dominant phase ; see fig.[fig : cone - fan ] ) in the high - field region . by mapping to an effective lagrangian , we study the low - energy properties of the cone and the fan phases in sec .

    "[ fig : cone - fan ] ]",
    "to apply the powerful bose - gas technique , we first rewrite the original spin model in terms of bosons .",
    "when the external field h is larger than the saturation field h@xmath21 , spins are fully polarized along h ( downward , here ) and any spin - flip excitations from this reference state can be expressed exactly in terms of hardcore bosons .",
    "specifically , we write the spin operators as : @xmath22 then , the original spin hamiltonian in general may be rewritten in the following way : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites . in helimagnets",
    ", the single - spin flip excitation @xmath26 takes its minima @xmath8 at two inequivalent @xmath27-points @xmath28 . the external field h controls the chemical potential @xmath29 and the on - site interaction @xmath30 has been added to impose the hardcore constraint .    in what follows",
    ", we consider a cubic lattice and assume that helical- and ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic order occur along the @xmath20-axis and in the @xmath31 plane , respectively ( i.e. @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "also , in order to avoid confusion , we use the indices @xmath34 for the real - space coordinate and reserve @xmath35 for the spin directions .",
    "we see that magnon bec occurs when the external field is smaller than the saturation field : @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . although the hard - core formulation is valid only for spin-1/2 , it can be generalized@xcite , with a little modification , to arbitrary spin-@xmath38 .",
    "the thermal potential per site @xmath39 of the dilute bose gas is determined by the interaction among the condensed bosons at @xmath40 and the ground - state boson densities @xmath41 are obtained by minimizing @xmath39 . if we denote the renormalized interactions between the same bosons and that between different ones respectively as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the energy density @xmath39 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",

    "hence , the spin configuration is determined as : @xmath57 that is , the cone state ( the left panel of fig.[fig : cone - fan ] ) , which exists already in the classical case@xcite , is favored for @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to see that this phase exhibits the multiferroic behavior . according to the so - called spin - current mechanism",
    ", a microscopic electric polarization @xmath59 , which is associated with a pair of sites @xmath5 and @xmath4 , is given by@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "when the external field h is parallel to the @xmath62(or @xmath63)-axis , the @xmath64-vector is in the spiral plane , which is perpendicular to @xmath65 , and the summation of the local polarization @xmath59 over the lattice yields a finite polarization @xmath66 parallel to @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath65 is along the @xmath20-axis , on the other hand , the local polarization sums up to zero and the system shows no ferroelectricity .      if @xmath68 and @xmath69 , on the other hand , the two modes condense simultaneously and the ground state is determined as : @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath72 the two parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 characterize arbitrary phases of the two condensates @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively and lead to two different low - energy excitations . since @xmath77 ,",
    "the spins assume a coplanar configuration ( _ fan _ ) shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : cone - fan ] .",
    "the ferroelectric property of this phase can be seen again from eq.([mf - p ] ) .",
    "if one moves from one site to the next along the @xmath20-axis , spins change their direction periodically within a basal plane specified by the azimuthal angle @xmath78 ( see fig.[fig : cone - fan ] ) . although the vector chirality on each bond @xmath79 is always pointing a fixed direction perpendicular to the basal plane ,",
    "it changes the sign within a period ; for the first half period , it is positive and for the latter negative .",
    "hence the local polarizations @xmath80 , when summed up along the @xmath20-axis , exactly cancel out and yield zero macroscopic polarization ( note that only bonds parallel to the @xmath20-axis give non - zero contribution ) .",
    "here we would like to stress that the fan state here does not require any kind of easy - plane anisotropy and should be distinguished from its classical counterpart which exists _ only _ in easy - plane helimagnets@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in the second case ( _ fan _ ) the ordinary superfluid order ( @xmath81 ) and the spin - density wave , where @xmath82 modulates with momentum @xmath83 , coexist .",

    "if the energy ( [ effpotential ] ) is taken literally , first order transitions may be expected on general grounds . in some cases",
    ", this scenario may be the case and , on physical ground , we may expect bosons to `` collapse '' in real space",
    ". it might well be that as a subsequent phase a cone or fan phase appears via first - order transition",
    ". however , eq.([effpotential ] ) is based on the assumption that magnon bec occurs in the single - particle channel and may not work when we expect magnon bound states stabilized by strong attraction .",
    "in fact , this conditions for @xmath52 implies nothing but instability in the one - magnon condensates . in sec.[sec : j1j2model ] , we calculate the energy of the 2-magnon bound state in the concrete model . as a result",

    "in fact , in a large portion of the phase-(iii ) ( a region marked as ( iv ) in fig.[fig : quasi1dnem ] ) , we have a stable two - magnon bound states which condense first when the external field is decreased . in the 1d @xmath14-@xmath15 model ( i.e. @xmath153 )",
