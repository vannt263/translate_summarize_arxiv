    "non - infected target cells are produced by the thymus at a constant rate @xmath12 and die at a rate @xmath13 . by contact with the free virus particles ( virions ) they become infected at a rate proportional to their abundance , @xmath14 ( see fig .",

    "these infected cells die at a rate @xmath15 and produce free viruses during their life - time at a rate @xmath16 .",
    "free particles are removed at a rate called the clearance @xmath17 .",
    "all these parameters are generally positive constants .",
    "this simple model study has led to interesting results ( see @xcite ) and suggested a treatment strategy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "-5truemm     +    [ contact ]    it is easily seen that the system has two equilibria :    a.   the _ non - infected _ steady state @xmath18 which corresponds to a non - negative equilibrium in case of no infection ; b.   the _ infected _ steady state @xmath19 also called _ seropositivity _ steady state , corresponding to a positive equilibrium in case of infection .",
    "some authors ( see e.g. , @xcite ) have considered the basic reproductive ratio @xmath20 : @xmath21 a dimensionless parameter defined by epidemiologists as _ the average number of infected cells that derive from any one infected cell in the beginning of the infection _ @xcite .",
    "stability properties of the two steady states are usually studied around this quantity : if @xmath22 the non - infected steady state is stable , if @xmath23 the infected steady state has a biological meaning and it is stable , while at @xmath24 both steady states coincide .",

    "in the spirit of the above works , we intend to study system - in a two - dimensional spatial domain @xmath29 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there are two main situations :    1 .",
    "the environment is _ homogeneous _ and , hence , all the parameters in - are constant . therefore , the system with diffusion has the same equilibria as system - ; 2 .",
    "the environment is _ heterogeneous _ , therefore certain parameters become positive functions of the space variable .",
    "then , the virus is spatially structured .    for simplicity , we assume throughout the paper that only the rate @xmath12 varies while the other parameters are fixed positive constants .",
    "in fact , it is biologically plausible to assume that the arrival of new @xmath9 may vary according to local areas .",
    "more precisely , @xmath12 is piecewise continuous and periodic in each variable with period @xmath30 .",
    "then it is convenient to define the _ heterogeneous reproductive ratio _ : @xmath31 the sites where @xmath32 are called _ sinks _ while the sites where @xmath33 are called _ sources _ @xcite .",

    "have been observed numerically in ode systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , proving the stability of the infected solution may be , in general , challenging .",
