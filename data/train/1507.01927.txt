    "the elm results can be compared to the case at @xmath38 in figure  16 of @xcite .",
    "one major difference is that up to ten balmer lines are typically fitted simultaneously for elm wds , since the non - ideal effects and the sensitivity to surface gravity are shifted to higher balmer lines @xcite . for the simulation at @xmath39",
    "k and @xmath40 in the middle panel of figure  [ fg : fprofiles ] , it is only for h10 and higher lines in the series that @xmath32 profiles become shallower than 1d profiles due to differences in the predicted non - ideal effects .",
    "the latter are very sensitive to the density stratification in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the shape of the lower balmer lines is also significantly different between @xmath32 and 1d spectra at intermediate @xmath0 , which is mostly responsible for @xmath0 shifts .",
    "the @xmath32 and 1d balmer lines become identical at high @xmath0 values ( see the right panel of figure  [ fg : fprofiles ] ) . for elm wds , this transition appears at relatively low temperatures , and 3d effects are largely negligible on the thermal structures for @xmath41  k. similarly to c / o - core wds , convection becomes very inefficient in this regime and the thermal structure is essentially fixed by the radiation field , even though convective velocities are still large . for cool @xmath0 values , the left panel of figure  [ fg : fprofiles ] suggests that 3d effects are small , but section 3.2 demonstrates that the @xmath32 approximation is not always good in this regime .",
    "figure  [ fg : fshifts ] presents the @xmath32 atmospheric parameter corrections found by fitting the @xmath28 spectra with our standard grid of 1d spectra .",
    "the corrections were derived simultaneously for the nine balmer lines from h@xmath42 to h12 in the same way we fit observations .",
    "the @xmath28 structures deviate significantly from their 1d counterparts in the upper layers ( @xmath43 ) due to the cooling effect of convective overshoot .",
    "this results in deep @xmath35 cores for h@xmath37 and h@xmath42 , as observed in the middle panel of figure  [ fg : fprofiles ] .",
    "while we have no suggestion that the 3d simulations are inaccurate , there is no observational evidence for an adiabatic surface cooling in wds and it appears premature to account for these effects . as a consequence , the line cores were partially removed from the fits , as well as the entire h@xmath37 line , as discussed in sect .",
    "3.1 of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 atmospheric parameter corrections for elm wds in figure  [ fg : fshifts ] follow the trend observed for higher gravity objects , despite the fact that more lines are included in the fitting procedure in the former case .",
    "the @xmath35 @xmath1 corrections have a similar strength for elm and c / o - core wds , although they are restricted to a narrower range of @xmath0 at low surface gravity .",
    "we have employed the linfor3d three - dimensional spectral synthesis code @xcite to compute 3d h@xmath42 profiles for elm white dwarfs . unlike our previous experiments for @xmath34 ,",
    "the 3d spectra and their @xmath32 counterparts from properly averaged @xmath32 structures differ by a few percent , with the largest effects at lower gravities .",
    "it is currently out of the scope of this work to proceed with the time - consuming computation of a full grid of 3d synthetic spectra .",
    "however , to further constrain the precision of the 3d corrections , we have recomputed our grid of elm spectra with the so - called 1.5d approximation @xcite . under this formalism , we assume that the physical conditions do not vary in the horizontal direction for each point on the top of the computational box , i.e. each column is a plane - parallel atmosphere .",
    "the 1.5d spectrum is then the average over all @xmath44 columns , for which the emergent 1d spectra can be easily calculated from our regular spectral synthesis code .",
    "the full 3d spectral synthesis has the effect of coupling nearby grid points , hence it is expected to lie somewhere between the extreme cases of the 1.5d and @xmath32 approximations .    in figure  [ fg : fshifts ] , we compare the 1.5d ( blue ) and @xmath35 ( black ) atmospheric parameter corrections .",
    "we notice that while the @xmath32 approximation is relatively good at @xmath45 , especially in terms of @xmath1 corrections , it becomes questionable at lower gravities .",
    "we remind the reader that the 1.5d approximation overestimates 3d effects , hence suggests an upper limit to the 3d corrections . since both 1.5d and @xmath32 corrections have the same signs",
    ", we suggest that applying the @xmath32 corrections provides a minimum 3d effect and a reasonable estimate of the atmospheric parameters of elm wds .",
    "the deficiency of the @xmath32 approximation for elm wds is likely explained by multiple factors .",
    "the temperature fluctuations are slightly larger at lower gravities although this could not alone explain the variations . on the other hand , we find that the line to continuum emergent intensity ratio has a significantly larger spatial variation for lower surface gravities .",
    "it implies that fluctuations are less likely to cancel in the 3d spectral synthesis .",
    "this could be related to the fact that broadening due to collisions with neutral atoms becomes increasingly important at the low @xmath0 values where strong 3d effects are observed in elm wds .",
    "finally , we have verified that the @xmath32 approximation is not the cause for the slight residual bump in the 3d wd mass distribution at @xmath46  k @xcite or the presence of deep cores for the lower balmer lines compared to 1d spectra .",
    "these features are also present when using 1.5d spectra .",

    "the boundary is simply shifted to the right by 100 k. the blue edge of the instability strip is still well defined for both normal mass and elm wds in the 3d analysis . for the red edge , as in the 1d case , we use gd 518 and sdss j222859.93 + 362359.6 as the two anchor points at either extremity ( the highest and lowest surface gravity ) to define the 3d red edge , which now has a higher slope .",
    "the equations of the revised blue and red edges are defined by equations [ eq : blue ] and [ eq : red ] , respectively .",
    "given the small number of elm pulsators currently known , it is too early to definitively constrain the red edge of the instability strip for those stars .",
    "the new zz ceti instability strip from the 3d analysis does not reveal any new elm pulsator candidates in the published list of elm wds , but the revised boundaries should be used in the future to look for new pulsating da wds .",

    "we provide mean 3d model spectra for wds with @xmath106 , extending the previously published 3d model grid to very low - mass wds .",
    "our 3d models now cover the entire temperature and surface gravity range for the observed population of convective da wds .",
    "we list 1d to 3d correction factors , which can be as large as 0.35 dex in surface gravity .",
    "these corrections largely resolve the discrepancies seen in the @xmath71 and radius estimates for relatively cool elm wds that are observed in double wd or wd + milli - second pulsar systems .",
