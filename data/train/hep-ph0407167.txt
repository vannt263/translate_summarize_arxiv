    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that the two photon exchange ( tpe ) mechanism can generate the single - spin normal asymmetry ( ssna ) of electron scattering due to a nonzero imaginary part of the tpe amplitude @xmath0 , @xmath1 where symbol @xmath2 denotes the imaginary ( absorptive ) part .",
    "the one - photon - exchange amplitude @xmath3 is purely real due to time - reversal invariance of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the first calculations of the tpe effect on the proton @xcite predicted the magnitude of beam ssna at the level of a few parts per million ( ppm ) .",
    "the effect appears to be small due to two suppression factors combined : @xmath4 , since the effect is higher - order in the electromagnetic interaction , and the electron mass @xmath5 arising due to electron helicity flip .",
    "the predictions of ref.@xcite which correspond only to elastic intermediate proton state are in qualitative agreement with experimental data from mit / bates @xcite and they were reproduced later in ref.@xcite .    however , the main theoretical problem in description of the tpe amplitude on the proton is a large uncertainty in the contribution of the inelastic hadronic intermediate states . in ref.@xcite",
    "the beam ssna at large momentum transfers was estimated at the level of one ppm , using the partonic picture developed in ref.@xcite for tpe effects but not related to the electron helicity flip .",
    "current experiments designed for parity - violating electron scattering allow to measure the beam asymmetry with a fraction of ppm accuracy @xcite and may also provide data on the parity - conserving beam ssna .",
    "in fact , such measurements are needed because beam ssna is a source of systematic corrections in the measurements of parity - violating observables .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that while considering excitation of inelastic intermediate hadronic states , the beam ssna ( eq.(11 ) of ref.@xcite ) , after factoring out the electron mass , has an enhancement when at least one of the photons in the tpe loop diagram is collinear to its parent electron .",
    "it is interesting that this effect did not appear for the target ssna .",
    "similar behaviour of the beam ssna in the nucleon resonance region was observed also in @xcite where authors used a phenomenological model ( maid ) for single - pion electroproduction .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that collinear photon exchange in the tpe amplitude results in single- and double - logarithmic enhancement of the beam ssna , whereas such enhancement does not take place for the target ssna ( with unpolarized electrons ) and spin correlations caused by longitudinal polarization of the scattering electrons . for large electron energies and small scattering angles , we use an optical theorem to relate the nucleon compton amplitude to the total photoproduction cross section and",
    "obtain a simple analytic formula for the beam ssna in this kinematics .",
    "first , we write the formula for ssna in terms of rank-3 leptonic and hadronic tensors which appear in the interference between the born and tpe amplitudes as shown in fig.[diagrams ] .",

    "the single - spin normal asymmetry probes the imaginary part of contraction of the leptonic and hadronic tensors defined by eqs.([4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , respectively .",
    "these tensors satisfy the conditions @xmath23 separately for spin  independent and spin  dependent parts , as follows from gauge invariance of electromagnetic interactions .    after some algebra",
    "we arrive at the following expression for the model - independent leptonic tensor @xmath24 where the spin ",

    "therefore , we expect no contribution from considered kinematics to the target ssna or to longitudinal - spin correlations because any gauge invariant hadronic tensor has to give zero after contracting with @xmath35 ( see eq.(6 ) ) .    in the case of the normal polarized electron beam @xmath36}}\\ .\\ ] ] tensor @xmath34 is not zero and the considered collinear photon kinematics contributes with essential logarithmic enhancement .    therefore , conservation of the electromagnetic current that follows from gauge invariance ( eq.([6 ] ) ) is the reason why the collinear intermediate photons appear in the tpe contribution to the beam ssna , but not to the target ssna . by analogy ,",
    "we do not anticipate contributions from collinear - photon exchange in unpolarized electron - proton scattering , parity - conserving and parity - violating asymmetries due to longitudinal electron polarization the normal polarization of leptons is not involved .",
    "let us consider the hadronic tensor .",
    "small values of @xmath37 correspond to the forward limit of nucleon virtual compton amplitude @xmath22 . on the other hand , because @xmath38 and @xmath39 are also small in the collinear photon limit , we can relate the forward compton amplitude to the total photoproduction cross section by real photons .",
    "a general form of the compton tensor @xmath22 in terms of 18 independent invariant amplitudes that are free from kinematical singularities and zeros was derived in ref.@xcite . among these amplitudes",
    "we choose the ones that contribute at the limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 it automatically constrains virtuality of the second photon to @xmath42 .",

    "it may seem at first that in the considered limiting case of very small @xmath37 one can omit all terms proportional to @xmath56 in the hadronic tensor .",
    "but such approximation is valid only for the symmetric part of @xmath22 with respect to the indexes @xmath57 and @xmath58 the reason is that the corresponding symmetric part of the leptonic tensor ( see eq.([9 ] ) ) contains the momentum transfer @xmath56 , and keeping it in the symmetric part of hadronic tensor leads after contraction to additional small terms of the order at least @xmath59 on the other hand , the antisymmetric part of leptonic tensor contains terms which do not include the momentum @xmath60 therefore , the antisymmetric part in eq.([17 ] ) has to be retained because it contributes at the same order with respect to @xmath59 note , however , that this antisymmetric part of the hadronic tensor is not related to the polarized nucleon structure functions , but it comes about as a consequence of the gauge - invariant structure of eq.([14 ] ) even for a spinless hadronic target .",

    "then we divide the integration region into the following two parts , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and choose the auxiliary parameter @xmath92 in such a way that @xmath93    in the first region we can neglect @xmath83 as compared with @xmath85 and write the corresponding contribution in the form @xmath94 we see that the contribution from the first region is negligible , therefore we can choose zero for the lower limit of integration in @xmath95 . in the second region",
    "the quantity @xmath96 that enters @xmath88 is small and we have @xmath97 the integration in eq.([23 ] ) gives @xmath98    in the sum @xmath99 we arrive at the following master formula that defines the beam ssna for small values of @xmath37 and takes into account contributions from intermediate collinear photons in the tpe box diagrams @xmath100 one can see that at fixed values of @xmath37 the beam ssna does not depend on the beam energy if the total photoproduction cross section is energy - independent .",
    "this remarkable property of small - angle beam ssna follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix and does not rely on a specific model of nucleon structure .",
    "the master formula for beam ssna eq.([24 ] ) neglects possible @xmath37 dependence of the invariant form factor of the nucleon compton amplitude , which was taken in its forward limit during the derivation . in numerical calculations",
    ", we estimate additional @xmath37 dependence by introducing an empirical form factor that was measured experimentally in the compton scattering on the nucleon in the diffractive regime ( see @xcite for review ) . in the following , we use an exponential suppression factor for",
    "the nucleon compton amplitude @xmath101 , choosing the parameter @xmath102=8 gev@xmath103 that gives a good description of the nucleon compton cross section from the optical point to @xmath104 0.8 gev@xmath105 ( see table v of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the predictions of eq.([24 ] ) combined with the above described exponential suppression are presented in fig.[fig : thdep ] for the electron scattering kinematics relevant for the e158 experiment at slac @xcite .",
    "we choose fit 1 of ref.@xcite for the total photoproduction cross section in eq.([24 ] ) .",
    "exact numerical loop integration of eq.([2 ] ) and the analytic results of eq.([24 ] ) agree with each other with accuracy better than 1% .",
    "contributions from the resonance region ( @xmath106 4 gev@xmath105 ) were estimated at 10 - 20% at beam energies of 3 gev , but rapidly decreasing below 1% at higher energies .",
    "we also tested sensitivity of our results to @xmath107 dependence of the electroproduction structure function @xmath50 ( eq.([15 ] ) ) , taking various empirical parameterizations for it .",
    "we found no sensitivity for slac e158 kinematics and only moderate sensitivity ( @xmath70 10% ) when we extend our calculation to lower energies ( @xmath703 gev ) and higher @xmath1080.5 gev@xmath105 . for beam energies of 45 gev",
    ", numerical integration shows that more than 95% ( 80% ) of the result for beam ssna comes from the upper 1/2 ( 3/4 ) part of the @xmath29-integration range .",
    "based on the results of numerical analysis , we conclude that the formula ( [ 24 ] ) gives a good description of beam ssna at small @xmath37 and large @xmath109 above the resonance region .         for different beam energies .",
    "notation is as in fig.[fig : thdep].,width=264 ]    we also calculated the contribution of the elastic intermediate proton state to the beam ssna for high energies and small electron scattering angles using the formalism of ref.@xcite and found it to be highly supressed compared to the inelastic excitations . for the kinematics of slac e158 @xcite ,",

    "the physical reason for the almost constant photoproduction cross sections at high energies is believed to be soft pomeron exchange @xcite , therefore the beam ssna in the considered kinematics is sensitive to the physics of soft diffraction .",
    "the predicted @xmath37 and energy dependence of beam ssna , along with its relatively large magnitude , is quite different from the model expectations assuming that no hadronic intermediate states are excited in the tpe amplitude .",
    "our unitarity - based model of small - angle electron scattering predicts the magnitude of the beam ssna to reach a few ppm in a wide range of beam energies .",
    "the good news is that it makes beam ssna measurable with presently reached fraction - of - ppm precision of parity - violating electron scattering experiments @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the experiments measuring parity - violating observables need to use special care to avoid possible systematic uncertainties due to the parity - conserving beam ssna .",
    "fortunately , these effects can be experimentally separated using different azimuthal dependences of these asymmetries .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the beam ssna for small values of @xmath37 and provide physics arguments for the dominance of contributions from collinear photons in the tpe mechanism . for electron energies above the nucleon resonance region and",
    "small @xmath37 the contribution of collinear virtual photons leads to the beam ssna that is negative and has the order of @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the total photoproduction cross section on the proton .",
    "this quantity is multiplied by the factor of the order unity that includes a single - logarithm term .",
    "the fact that the beam ssna does not decrease with the beam energy at fixed @xmath37 makes it attractive for experimental studies at higher energies , for example , the energies to be reached at jefferson lab after the forthcoming 12-gev upgrade of cebaf .",
