    "the gunn effect is an ubiquitous phenomenon in many semiconductor samples presenting negative differential resistance and subject to voltage bias conditions @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "the negative differential resistance makes it possible the existence of a variety of pulses and wavefronts , which may be stabilized by the bias condition .",
    "then a periodic shedding of waves by the injecting contact results in the periodic oscillation of the current through an external circuit , which constitutes the signature of the gunn effect .",
    "there is a vast literature on this topic , despite of which different basic questions concerning the gunn effect remain poorly understood .",
    "paramount among these , there are the questions about which are the correct boundary conditions and , given these , how to describe all the stages of the gunn oscillation .",
    "the lack of a precise formulation of the boundary conditions imposed by contacts on semiconductors and of a simple analytic treatment to analyze the gunn oscillations , has not allowed to clarify in a precise way the role played by contacts in the gunn effect .",
    "it is worth noting that clarifying this point would open , for instance , the possibility of extracting information about the contacts from the analysis of the gunn oscillations themselves , a subject of considerable interest for applied researchers .",
    "recently progress has been made towards answering reasonably these two questions .",
    "on the one hand , ideas from irreversible thermodynamics @xcite have been used to derive satisfactory boundary conditions for metal - semiconductor and other contacts in a general way @xcite .",
    "previously the usual boundary conditions used in drift - diffusion semiconductor models were : ( i ) periodic,@xcite ( ii ) charge neutrality,@xcite ( iii ) fixed field,@xcite and ( iv ) control current - field characteristics of the contact @xcite plus phenomenological assumptions such as the `` contact length '' @xcite .",
    "as boundary conditions ( b.c . ) for a semiconductor presenting the gunn effect , these conditions rank from clearly wrong ( no current oscillation appears if the b.c .",
    "are periodic ) to unsatisfactory because of their ad hoc character .",
    "thus even when numerical simulations display the gunn effect , the question of whether these results describe the real physical system where different contacts are present , is usually raised . in this paper",
    ", we shall present a simple derivation of appropriate b.c . for an ideal metal - semiconductor ( ms ) contact and use them to analyze the gunn effect in kroemer s model for bulk n - gaas .",
    "our description makes it clear which part of the derivation follows from general principles and which part includes the input from the physics of contacts .    concerning asymptotic descriptions of the gunn effect which delve deeper than just numerical simulations of drift - diffusion models ,",
    "some progress has been made recently @xcite .",
    "a detailed treatment of this topic can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our derivation of b.c . for ideal ms contacts and briefly discuss some other possibilities .",
    "kroemer s model and its stationary solutions for these b.c .",
    "are analyzed in section iii .",

    "different types of gunn effect , namely , charge monopoles ( moving charge accumulation and depletion layers ) , and charge dipoles , ( high and low field solitary waves ) , are predicted to appear depending on these contact parameters , when no stable stationary solution exists . in section",
    "v we discuss our results , whereas appendix a is devoted to technical matters related to the main text .",
    "the aim of this section is to present a systematic procedure to derive b.c . at semiconductor contacts , established in previous works @xcite . as a general rule",
    ", the method applies for non - degenerate semiconductors under moderate temperatures , that is , when thermionic emission is the dominant transport process at the contact .",
    "hence several contacts of interest , like ideal and non - ideal metal - semiconductor ( ms ) contacts or any type of heterojunction contact , can be modeled .",
    "depending on the material parameters both limiting as well as ohmic contacts may then be described .",
    "it is worth noting that a precise modeling of this type of contacts may help to clarify the role played by other types of contacts used in semiconductor systems , e.g. those in which thermionic - field or field emission processes dominate @xcite , for which a precise description , in the sense of the present paper , is not yet available . for the sake of clarity",
    ", the method will be presented along with its application to the case of an ideal ms contact .",
    "other contacts have been considered in previous papers @xcite .",
    "let us consider an ideal ms contact .",
    "due to the presence of the contact , the magnitudes describing the physical properties of the system , e.g electron density , electric field , electron energy ,  , may be discontinuous at that point .",
    "in addition , singular contributions localized at the contact itself , e.g. electron density at interface states ( when they are present ) , may also occur . as a consequence , a given physical magnitude , @xmath2 ,",
    "can be decomposed as follows @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 refer to the values in the semiconductor ( @xmath7 ) , metal ( @xmath8 ) , and surface ( @xmath9 ) parts , respectively ( when no singular contribution is present , @xmath6 vanishes ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 is heaviside s unit step function and @xmath11 dirac s delta function .",
    "they are introduced in order to represent the discontinuity across the contact and the singular contributions , respectively . in writing eq.([descom ] ) , a one dimensional description of the system has been assumed , with the contact being located at @xmath12 and the metal [ semiconductor ] on its left [ right ] . by means of this type of decomposition , b.c . can be systematically derived .",
    "our procedure consists of two steps : a ) the identification of the relevant magnitudes describing the transport processes through the contact , and b ) the derivation of precise laws describing such processes , which relate the relevant magnitudes at the contact and which constitute the desired b.c .. for the first step , use will be made of a phenomenological formulation of transport through semiconductor junctions@xcite while for the second of shockley - read - hall ( srh ) statistics @xcite .",
    "let us consider a given magnitude , @xmath2 , satisfying a standard balance equation of the form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to the current and net rate production associated to the magnitude @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "it is not difficult to show that if similar balance equations were to be satisfied on each side of the junction and if surface fluxes only exist along the interface ( what in a one dimensional description means @xmath17 ) , then the following balance equation should be satisfied at the contact , @xcite @xmath18 = \\sigma_{d , s}(\\tilde{t } ) .",
    "\\label{balance}\\ ] ] now , we can proceed to calculate the net rate of entropy production at the contact , which will allow us to identify the relevant magnitudes describing the transport processes trough the contact . to begin with",

    "hence , the balance of internal energy is described directly through eq.([balancee ] ) or alternatively through @xmath21 =                                      \\sigma_{u , s}(\\tilde{t } ) , \\label{balanceu}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 - [ j_{u , m}(0,\\tilde{t})-j_{e , m}(0,\\tilde{t})]$ ] . in the previous expression , we have introduced explicitly the flux of internal energy ( equivalent to the heat flux ) , which is in general different from the flux of total energy .",
    "furthermore the gibbs equation for an ideal contact is @xcite @xmath23 ( no interface states are present ) , where @xmath24 is the surface entropy and @xmath25 the temperature . by assuming the contact to be in local equilibrium ,",
    "one then has @xmath26 , which , after using eq.([balanceu ] ) , gives rise to the balance equation for the entropy @xmath27 =                                      \\sigma_{s , s}(\\tilde{t } ) , \\label{balances}\\ ] ] with the entropy production given by @xmath28                      \\nonumber \\\\                         & & -[j_{s , m}(0,\\tilde{t } ) -                          \\frac{1}{t } j_{e , m}(0,\\tilde{t } ) ] .",

    "@xmath37 is the electric potential ( which is continuous through an abrupt junction ) and @xmath38 is minus the charge of the electron .",
    "we then arrive at the desired expression , @xmath39 j_{n}(0,\\tilde{t } ) .",
    "\\label{finals}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ finals ] ) shows directly that the relevant magnitudes describing an ideal ms contact are the electron flux ( electron current density divided by @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 , and the discontinuity in the electron quasi - fermi levels , @xmath42 , which plays the role of `` thermodynamic force '' , @xcite .",
    "both flux and force vanish at equilibrium , and we assume ( in accordance with the basic tenets of irreversible thermodynamics @xcite ) that there is a relation between them .",
    "when the fundamental relation between flux and force is specified , this relation is exactly the sought - after boundary condition at the contact .",
    "the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath43 should involve more information about the physics of the contact .",
    "first of all , let us notice that the entropy production ( [ finals ] ) is formally equivalent to the expression corresponding to generation - recombination processes @xcite ( or in general , to any activated process , such as unimolecular chemical reactions @xcite or surface adsorption @xcite ) , provided @xmath41 is identified with the net rate of the process . from this comparison",
    "we then conclude that the transport through an ideal ms contact may be described as an elementary kinetic process of the form : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the carriers in the semiconductor and metal , respectively , with the _ net rate of the process _ being equal to @xmath47 .",
    "the kinetics of such a process can be described , for instance , by means of srh statistics .",
    "as it is well known , this description relates the kinetic rate of the process , in our case @xmath47 , to the affinity , in our case the difference in quasi - fermi levels , in agreement with our former general treatment . as it is shown in appendix [ appendixa ] , we obtain the following relation between the net rate of the process , @xmath41 , and the jump of the quasi - fermi level at the ms contact , @xmath43 : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is a positive constant [ see ( [ lambda ] ) in appendix [ appendixa ] ] , and @xmath50 is the contact barrier height .",
    "@xmath51 , is the electron energy , with @xmath52 the bottom of the semiconductor conduction band and @xmath53 the electric potential at the semiconductor surface .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "eq.([te ] ) is the sought b.c . for the ideal ms contact .",
    "it can be written more explicitly by using the expression @xmath56 , which holds for non - degenerate semiconductors with @xmath57 being the semiconductor electron number density and @xmath58 the effective density of states .",
    "we then have , @xmath59    in the non - degenerate case , @xmath49 only depends on @xmath25 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "this result ends the derivation of the b.c . for ideal ms contacts which we will use for the rest of this paper .",
    "it is worth emphasizing at this point that , as mentioned at the beginning of this section , the procedure we have sketched here for the ideal ms contact , can be applied to several other types of contacts .",
    "these include non - ideal ms contacts with the presence of interface states @xcite and unipolar or bipolar heterojunction contacts with or without interface states @xcite . moreover , by adding a few assumptions one can handle non - abrupt contacts @xcite .",
    "note that for a ms contact located at @xmath60 , that is , with the metal [ semiconductor ] on the right [ left ] hand side of the contact , the corresponding b.c .",
    "is @xmath61    we can compare our result , eq.([sze ] ) for the ideal ms contact with the corresponding one reported in @xcite [ see also p.  261 of ref.@xcite ] .",
    "then we can identify @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the richardson constant for the semiconductor in contact with the metal located at @xmath65 .",
    "theoretically , @xmath64 , and hence @xmath66 , would depend only on the given semiconductor but not on the metal @xcite .",
    "however , in practice @xmath64 is taken as a phenomenological parameter and it can not only depend on the metal but also on the preparation procedures @xcite . on the other hand , basic energetic arguments lead immediately to the following rule for the contact barrier height @xcite : @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 is the work function of the metal in the ms contact located at @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the semiconductor electron affinity . for covalent semiconductors ,",
    "the validity of this rule has been put under question for the last five decades @xcite . however , recently it has been shown that even for this type of semiconductors , if accurately growth materials are used , good agreement is obtained with this simple rule @xcite .",
    "notice , that when such materials are not used , as very often happens , the contact formed turns out to be non - ideal .",
    "this is so because it is difficult to avoid that very thin insulating layers and/or interface states may be present at the contact @xcite .",
    "hence , a non - ideal description of the contact should be used , with for instance , a bias dependent relation for the barrier height which would include the effects of the insulating layer and of the interface states .",
    "such contacts have been described in detail in ref .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that for this non - ideal contacts there is no simple description using directly equations such as ( [ te ] ) or ( [ sze ] ) , for contact non - stationary effects induced by interface sates ( not present for ideal ms contacts ) introduce additional terms not present in eq.([te ] ) .",
    "these terms could be of importance when describing naturally non - stationary phenomena such as the gunn effect with non - ideal contacts , and will be considered in future works .",
    "( [ sze ] ) and ( [ szel ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the electric field by using the poisson equation to eliminate the electron density from them : @xmath71 here the upper [ lower ] sign holds for @xmath72 [ @xmath73 ; @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath75 are the bulk semiconductor permitivity , and its doping , respectively .",
    "we have thus shown how our procedure allows us to derive explicit and precise expressions for the b.c",

    "a first important consequence of this method can be drawn directly from eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) , which is simply a relation between the normal _ derivative _ of the electric field and the current density at the contact . examining",
    "our derivation shows that this result is simply a consequence of the use of kinetic models to describe the exchange of carriers through the contact .",
    "hence , one should expect that b.c .",
    "derived in this way , will result in relationships between the normal derivative of the electric field and the current density at the contact .",
    "it is easily seen that ( if diffusion effects can be neglected ) our b.c .",
    "can be transformed into a kroemer s type contact current - field control characteristics @xcite ( see next section ) .",
    "however , unlike previous models following kroemer s approach @xcite , our control characteristics is the result of a physically precise derivation , and therefore only parameters which are physically well - defined appear in it . in particular , to use our control characteristics we do not have to invoke ad hoc assumptions involving new parameters such as the contact length @xcite .    to facilitate the analysis in the rest of the paper , it is convenient to rewrite eq .",

    "it should be noted that there are important restrictions on the possible values of the contact current density which are due to the fact that in eqs .",
