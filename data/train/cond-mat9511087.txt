    "it is widely believed that the spin structure of the ground state of high - temperature copper oxide superconductors is of the type of the anderson spin - liquid state@xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is well known that at zero doping the materials under consideration are insulators with long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "the instability of long - range af order under doping in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model was probably first realized by shraiman and siggia@xcite .",
    "it was later demonstrated in numerous works ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the instability is due to the strong interaction of spin - waves with mobile holes .",
    "the spin - wave polarization operator is needed for the analysis of this instability and especially for the derivation of the spin - liquid ground state .",
    "the calculation of the so called coherent part of the polarization operator is straightforward .",
    "however there is also the incoherent part .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to calculate this part and to provide a rigorous proof of its smallness in comparison with the coherent part .",
    "it means that in the analysis of the magnetic properties one can neglect the incoherent contribution to the spin - wave polarization operator .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with that of ref.@xcite based on the numerical computation .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the creation operator of a hole with spin @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) at site @xmath6 on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "the @xmath3 operators act in the hilbert space with no double electron occupancy .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath7@xmath4@xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 are pairs of nearest - neighbor sites on the lattice .",
    "below we set @xmath1 as well as the lattice spacing equal to unity .    at",
    "half - filling ( one hole per site ) the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is equivalent to the heisenberg af model@xcite which has long - range af order in the ground state@xcite .",
    "let us denote the wave function of this ground state by @xmath10 .",
    "this is the undoped system .",
    "we consider the doped system based on the ground state of the undoped system . in spite of the destruction of the long - range",
    "af order it is convenient to use @xmath10 and corresponding quasiparticle excitations as a basis set for the doped system . the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model was derived in terms of these quasiparticles in the papers@xcite : @xmath11 it is expressed in terms of normal spin - waves on an af background @xmath12 ( see e.g. review@xcite ) and composite hole operators @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the summations over @xmath15 and @xmath16 are restricted inside the brillouin zone of one sublattice where @xmath17 .",
    "the spin - wave dispersion relation is @xmath18    the properties of single holes are well established ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) . the wave function of a single hole can be represented as @xmath19 . at large @xmath0 the composite hole operator",
    "@xmath20 has a complex structure .",
    "for example at @xmath21 the weight of the bare hole in @xmath22 is about 25% , the weight of configurations of the type `` bare hole + 1 magnon '' is @xmath2350% and for configurations of the type `` bare hole + 2 or more magnons '' it is @xmath2325% .",
    "the dressed hole is a normal fermion .",
    "the hole energy @xmath24 has minima at @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 the dispersion can be well approximated by the expression@xcite @xmath28 the numerical values in this formula are some combinations of the heisenberg model spin correlators .",
    "the constant @xmath29 defines a reference level for the energy . to find @xmath24 with respect to the undoped system one has to set @xmath30 .",
    "however for the present work it is convenient to set @xmath31 and therefore @xmath32 . the coefficient @xmath33 is small and therefore the dispersion is almost degenerate along the face of the magnetic brillouin zone @xmath34 . according to refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "to avoid misunderstanding we note that formula ( [ hdisp ] ) is not valid for very large @xmath0 where the hole band width is saturated at the value of the order of unity and does not increase with @xmath0 .",
    "however , physically we are interested in @xmath37 ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) where ( [ hdisp ] ) works well . near the band minima , @xmath38",
    "the dispersion ( [ hdisp ] ) can be presented in the usual quadratic form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the projection of @xmath42 on the direction orthogonal ( parallel ) to the face of the magnetic brillouin zone ( fig .",
    "1 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ hdisp ] ) for @xmath43 we find @xmath44 , hence the mass anisotropy is @xmath45 . for small hole concentrations , i.e.",
    "@xmath46 , the holes are localized in momentum space in the vicinity of the minima of the band @xmath47 and the fermi surface consists of ellipses .",
    "( we recall that @xmath48 corresponds to an insulator with long - range af order . ) the fermi energy and fermi momentum of non - interacting holes are @xmath49 the fermi momentum @xmath50 is measured from the center of the corresponding ellipse .",
    "the interaction of a composite hole with spin - waves is of the form ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the parameters of the bogoliubov transformation diagonalizing the spin - wave hamiltonian .",
    "the hole spin - wave coupling constant @xmath54 is a function of @xmath0 evaluated in the work@xcite . for large @xmath0 the coupling",
    "constant is @xmath0-independent , @xmath55 .",
    "let us stress that even for @xmath56 the quasihole - spin - wave interaction ( [ hsw ] ) has the same form as for @xmath57 ( i.e. as for bare hole operators ) with an added renormalization factor ( of the order @xmath58 for @xmath59 ) .",
    "this remarkable property of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is due to the absence of a single loop correction to the hole - spin - wave vertex .",
    "it was first stated implicitly by kane , lee and read@xcite .",
    "in refs.@xcite it was explicitly demonstrated that the vertex corrections with different kinematic structure are of the order of a few percent at @xmath60 .",
    "there is also some @xmath61-dependence of the coupling constant @xmath54 .",
    "for example @xmath62 at @xmath63 ( see refs .",
    "however this dependence is weak and is beyond the accuracy of the calculation of the renormalized value of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we neglect this dependence .",
    "finally there is the contact hole - hole interaction @xmath64 in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "@xmath64 is discussed in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is proportional to some function @xmath65 . for small @xmath0",
    "this function approaches the value @xmath66 , which gives the well known hole - hole attraction induced by the reduction of the number of missing antiferromagnetic links .",
    "however for realistic superconductors @xmath67 ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly the function @xmath65 vanishes exactly at @xmath67 and this means that the mechanism of contact hole - hole attraction is switched off .",
    "in contrast the spin - wave exchange mechanism @xmath68 is negligible for small @xmath0 for which @xmath69 and it is most important for large @xmath0 for which @xmath54 approaches 2 .",
    "we are interested in `` physical '' values of @xmath0 : @xmath37 .",
    "therefore in the present work we neglect the contact interaction ( @xmath70 ) and consider only the hole - spin - wave interaction at @xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath54 according to@xcite is @xmath72 .",
    "thus all numerical values in the present work are calculated at @xmath71 , @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "there are two types of spin - waves in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , one generally has to introduce a set of spin - wave green s functions@xcite : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "however if we restrict ourselves to the long wavelength limit , the consideration can be simplified .",
    "it is well known that in the long wavelength limit the heisenberg model is equivalent to the nonlinear @xmath4-model ( see e.g. review paper@xcite ) .",
    "therefore the usual field theory crossing symmetry is valid .",
    "the same is valid for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "this is evident from eq .",
    "( [ hsw ] ) : at @xmath80 the vertex @xmath81 .",
    "this means that instead of considering a set of green s functions one can introduce a single combined green s function of vector excitation : @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) is the mobile holes polarization operator . for the system to be stable the condition @xmath85",
    "should be fulfilled .",
    "otherwise the green s function ( [ gf ] ) would possess poles with imaginary @xmath86 .    in the single loop approximation for dressed quasiholes",
    "the polarization operator is given by the diagram in fig .",
    "the quasihole green s function in this diagram is determined by the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "let us call this contribution to the polarization operator the `` coherent part '' .",
    "the meaning of this term is elucidated below . in this paper",
    "we neglect the interaction between quasiholes and consider them as a normal fermi - liquid . in this approximation",
    "the calculation of a single loop polarization operator is very simple . in the static long wavelength limit",
    "the result is@xcite @xmath87 this is independent of the hole concentration ! using this result one can easily prove that the stability condition ( [ stab ] ) is violated because @xmath88 .",
    "this is a well known fact concerning the instability of long - range af order under doping ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "let us now explain the obtained result in terms of bare @xmath89 which enter into the bare hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the green s function of a bare hole is of the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the quasiparticle residue .",
    "if we use the bare hole green s function we also have to use the bare hole - spin - wave coupling constant @xmath92 in the vertex @xmath93 ( [ hsw ] ) .",
    "substitution of the pole ( coherent ) part of ( [ hgf ] ) into the single loop polarization operator gives the combination @xmath94 , but this is exactly the effective coupling constant @xmath54@xcite .",
    "thus in the single loop approximation the effective theory with hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) only takes into account the coherent ( pole ) part of the bare hole green s function ( [ hgf ] ) .",
    "because of this the contribution ( [ p0q ] ) is called the coherent part .",
    "the incoherent part of the polarization operator which comes from @xmath95 in ( [ hgf ] ) is proportional to the hole concentration @xmath96 .",
    "therefore it is negligible for @xmath46 .",
    "this conclusion agrees with that of becker and muschelknautz@xcite .",
    "now we will calculate @xmath97 explicitly .",
    "we give two different calculations of @xmath97 .",
    "the first calculation is based on the self - energy approach .",
    "it is well known that the self - energy as well as the polarization operator is in essence an energy shift of the system .",
    "let us consider the diagram in fig .",
    "3a which represents the energy shift of a hole ( solid line ) in an external spin - wave ( wavy line ) .",
    "if we join up the wavy lines and integrate over the momenta of the spin - wave we get the usual hole self energy ( fig .",
    "3b ) which is already taken into account in the correct ( renormalized ) hole dispersion ( [ hdisp ] ) and the renormalized value of the spin - wave coupling constant @xmath54 . if we join up the solid lines and integrate over the momenta of the hole we get the coherent polarization operator ( fig .",
    "3c ) which has also already been taken into account . let us consider now the first correction to the diagram fig . 3a .",
    "it is given by the diagrams in fig .",
    "4 . ( we remind the reader that there is no one loop correction to the spin - wave vertex . )",
    "this is the correction to the hole energy in an external spin - wave or the correction to the energy of the spin - wave in the presence of a single hole .",
    "the calculation of this correction is very simple if one uses schrdinger perturbation theory .",
    "consider for example the case when the external spin - wave is of the @xmath75-type , i.e. for this wave the z - projection of spin is @xmath98 .",
    "the arrows in fig .",
    "4 indicate the projections of hole spin ( note that there is a spin flip at each vertex ) .",
    "it is evident that for spin up diagram 4b vanishes and similarly for spin down diagram 4a vanishes .",
    "we will see that the integral over @xmath99 is logarithmically divergent .",
    "therefore we set @xmath100 . near the band minimum the hole energy is quadratic in momenta ( [ hdisp1 ] ) .",
    "therefore it can be neglected in comparison with the energy of the intermediate spin - wave @xmath101 which is linear in momentum .",
    "this means that the energies of all three intermediate states in fig .",
    "4a as well as in fig .",
    "4b are approximately equal to @xmath101 . therefore the energy correction corresponding to fig .",
    "4 is independent of the hole spin projection and equals @xmath102 the integration over @xmath99 is restricted by the limits @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the integral over @xmath99 is logarithmically divergent and therefore it gives a big logarithm : @xmath105 .",
    "when the momentum of the hole is close to the band minimum , @xmath106 , one gets @xmath107 to find the incoherent spin - wave polarization operator we now need to sum ( [ deps1 ] ) over all occupied hole states ( i.e. sum over @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus for @xmath108 and @xmath109 the result is @xmath110 there are also higher order diagrams which contribute to @xmath97 .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "5 . however all of these diagrams do not contain the big logarithm ( @xmath111 ) and therefore can be neglected according to the accepted accuracy .    to elucidate the meaning of @xmath97 we will now give a different derivation of ( [ pincoh ] ) . the first correction to the single loop polarization operator arises from the diagram presented in fig .",
    "6 . after integration over the energies in the closed loops",
    "one gets the following expression for the contribution of this diagram : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the ground state occupation number .",
    "the first two terms in the expression ( [ p6 ] ) have second powers of @xmath114 in the denominator .",
    "this factor is exactly the denominator of the one - loop polarization operator fig .",
    "it means that the first two terms correspond to the renormalization of the pole ( coherent ) part of the hole green s function ( [ hgf ] ) .",
    "they are actually already taken into account in @xmath115 because for the calculation of @xmath115 we have used the dressed hole green s function which absorbs all of the corrections to the pole part .",
    "thus the new contribution , corresponding to @xmath97 , arises from the last two terms in ( [ p6 ] ) . after carrying out some algebraic manipulation and using the fact that @xmath61 is small ( and so , for example @xmath116 ) @xmath97 can be written as @xmath117 it is evident that this expression is equivalent to ( [ deps ] ) .",
    "neglecting @xmath118 in comparison with @xmath101 and carrying out the integration over @xmath119 with logarithmic accuracy we once more come to the result ( [ pincoh ] ) for @xmath97 .",
    "in the present work we have analytically calculated the incoherent contribution to the spin - wave polarization operator . this analytical calculation is possible because of the logarithmic enhancement of the corresponding diagrams .",
    "the ratio of the incoherent contribution ( [ pincoh ] ) to the coherent one ( [ p0q ] ) is @xmath120 for the parameters of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model corresponding to realistic high - t@xmath121 superconductors and for hole concentration @xmath122 this ratio does not exceed 10% .",
    "it means that in the analysis of the magnetic properties one can neglect the incoherent contribution to the spin - wave polarization operator .    also at the budker institute of nuclear physics ,",
