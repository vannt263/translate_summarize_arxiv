    "alkaline - earth metal oxides ( aemos ) of rock - salt structure are simple ionic solids as opposed to more complicated transition metal oxides and their well - ordered surfaces are of great interest to theoretical and experimental surface science .",
    "@xcite due to their high stability and irreducibility , application of aemos in catalysis is limited to high temperature processes such as oxidative coupling of methane ,  @xcite but their activity can be enhanced via metal - doping ,  @xcite or they can be utilized as support materials for other catalysts .",
    "@xcite furthermore , this computational catalyst study is intended to fully explore and accurately map the surface properties such as stability , vacancy formation energetics , and adsorption of small molecules and bechmark theory to available experimental data .",
    "@xcite    previous calculations of aemo surfaces addressed the electronic structure , surface stability , relaxation , and rumpling effects of non - polar ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 211 ) facets .  @xcite it was found that for a given facet , the surface energy decreases along the series going from mgo to bao  an observation attributed mostly to a loss of madelung energy , which is largest for mgo .",
    "@xcite in addition , more open surfaces with greater number of cleaved bonds were found to be significantly less stable than the ( 100 ) surface due to a direct loss of energy associated with cleaved bonds .",
    "the origin of the positive rumpling for mgo and increasing negative rumpling for cao , sro , and bao was explained on the grounds of a well - known narrowing of the o(@xmath4 ) valence band .",
    "@xcite a stability study of the mgo(111 ) surface by ciston _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite revealed the presence of stable octopolar terminations when no water was present and stable hydroxylated surface terminations in the presence of water .",
    "the mgo(100 ) surface is without a doubt the most studied surface of the considered aemo series .",
    "in particular , adsorption of small molecules : co , no , ch@xmath0 , and h@xmath1o has received much attention by both experiments  @xcite and theory .",
    "@xcite important to mention are also recent accurate coupled - cluster benchmark studies of adsorption of co  @xcite and ch@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite previous theoretical studies of adsorption of water on the ( 100 ) surfaces of the aemo series revealed the preference towards dissociation of the water molecules for cao to bao .",
    "@xcite perhaps the least studied surface properties are related to oxygen adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation . to our knowledge only a handful of studies exist for oxygen vacancy formation on the mgo(100 ) surface .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we present a systematic computational study of surface properties of four aemos : mgo , cao , sro , and bao , by mapping their surface energies , co , no , and oxygen adsorption energies , and oxygen vacancy formation energies of the most stable surfaces of these oxides .",
    "while the surface energy is a determining factor for equilibrium morphology , co and no adsorption energies serve as probe molecules of surface reactivity .",
    "@xcite another important surface chemistry property of an oxide surface is its oxygen chemistry , _",
    "i.e. _ , a measure of the interaction between the surface and atomic oxygen on one hand and oxygen vacancies on the other hand , since these play a key role as active centers in most oxidative and dehydrogenation reactions processes .",
    "@xcite from a practical point of view , it is highly desirable that a computational catalyst study achieves an accurate mapping of possible surface energetics . in order to benchmark our theoretical approaches",
    ", we evaluated the accuracy of four levels of density functional theory ( dft ) theory : the local density approximation ( lda ) , the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) , van der waals corrected gga ( gga+vdw ) , screened hybrid - gga as well as post - dft random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , and assessed our findings against existing experimental data .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we give a brief introduction of our computational methodology , followed by a presentation of the results for bulk properties and surface stabilities of the four considered aemos .",
    "next , we discuss the performance of common dft functionals and the rpa method for adsorption of co , no , ch@xmath0 , and h@xmath1o molecules on the mgo(100 ) surface . then a mapping of the co and no adsorption energies on the different surfaces of the aemos is discussed .",
    "additionally , we also provide a detailed analysis of the bond character for representative systems , including a comparison between co@mgo(100 ) and co@bao(100 ) , and between no@mgo(100 ) and no@bao(100 ) . in the last part of the results section",
    ", we discuss the oxygen chemistry of the investigated surfaces .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary of our most relevant findings and their implications .",
    "we employed the periodic plane - wave basis set implementation of dft within the pwscf program of quantum espresso .",
    "@xcite we performed calculations with several dft functionals frequently used in solid - state and surface science studies : lda ,  @xcite gga : pbe ,  @xcite rpbe ,  @xcite and pbesol ,  @xcite gga with van der waals ( vdw ) density functional : beef - vdw ,  @xcite and screened gga - hybrid : hse .",
    "@xcite the beef - vdw approach combines semilocal bayesian error estimation functional with an additional vdw nonlocal correlation term .",
    "the vdw term is computed at via dft / vdw - wf2 method ,  @xcite which been shown to lead to improved description of surface processes .",
    "@xcite for elements from h to mg we used the pbe generated norm - conserving pseudopotentials of trouiller - martins  @xcite while for ca , sr , and ba we used the pseudopotentials of goedecker  hartwigse ",
    "teter ,  @xcite which explicitly include semicore states .",
    "the use of norm - conserving pseudopotentials was dictated by the implemenation of gga - hybrid part of pwscf .",
    "a kinetic - energy cutoff of 80  ry and 4 times that value for the charge density cutoff was used in the calculations except for the rpa calculations as described below .    the random - phase approximation  @xcite calculations where performed using the paw method@xcite within the plane - wave vasp code .",
    "@xcite the rpa energy at pbe optimized geometries were evaluated either i ) in conventional rpa@pbe scheme , where the exchange and correlation are calculated non - selfconsitently from pbe orbitals as @xmath5 , or ii ) in hybrid rpa@xmath6@pbe scheme,@xcite where the effect of self - consistent exchange energy is added as @xmath7 . the convergence of energy differences within few mevs was achieved with plane - wave cutoff of 350 ev for gw variants of vasp paw potentials .",

    "@xcite ]    the calculated bulk properties : lattice constants @xmath11 , bulk moduli @xmath8 , and atomization energies @xmath12 of the aemo series are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : bulk ] .",
    "for each of the observables , our calculated values follow the experimentally observed trend  @xcite and are also in agreement with previous theoretical findings .",
    "@xcite we find an increase in the lattice constant and a decrease of the bulk modulus going from mgo to bao within the aemo series , which is consistent with the increase of the ionic radii of the metal ions and shows a transition from ionic to more covalent bonding .",
    "@xcite the atomization energy exhibits a maximum for cao but the variations between the different aemos is fairly constant within a 1  ev range for a given dft functional .",
    "there are also characteristic trends in the above calculated quantities for a given dft functional and between different functionals .",
    "the well - known overestimation of the stability within lda is clearly visible for aemos .",
    "the lattice constants are too short and bulk moduli and atomization energies are too large . on the other hand ,",
    "the rpbe predictions are on the opposite side of the spectrum , with too long lattice constants and underestimation of atomization energies and bulk moduli .",
    "all other functionals included in this study lie within the lda  rpbe bounds .",
    "a comparison of our pbe , pbesol , and hse data with experimental data for bulk mgo show the following lattice constant dependence @xmath13 ( and similarly for bulk moduli @xmath8 ) while the atomization energy follows @xmath14 .",
    "these findings are in qualitatively agreement with the ones of shimka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite we find that the bulk properties obtained with the beef - vdw functional are not significantly improved over values obtained by the pbe functional .",
    "when it comes to the band gaps , the calculated values within the hse functional ( mgo : 6.7  ev , cao : 5.3  ev ; sro  ev : 4.7  ev ; bao : 3.2  ev ) are , as expected , the closest to experimental estimates ( 7.8  ev , 7.1  ev , 5.9  ev , and 4.3  ev from ref .  [ ] ) . for all functionals , the calculated density of states ( dos ) of the bulk aemos ( not shown ) exhibit a narrowing of the valence o(@xmath4 ) band and a shift of the metal m(@xmath15 ) semicore states towards higher energies within the series from mgo to bao in agreement with previous studies .",

    "the results for the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , and two octopolar ( 111 ) terminated ( m - oct , o - oct ) surfaces obtained using six different dft functionals are shown .",
    "the corresponding primitive cell of the surfaces used in the calculations are also shown as insets , where larger spheres represent the metal atoms .",
    "for clarity , only the top layer was rendered in color . ]",
    "the most stable surface termination of rock - salt type compounds is the non - polar ( 100 ) surface , which has been argued to be due to its close packed bulk - like structure .",
    "@xcite in terms of stability , the ( 110 ) surface followed by the ( 211 ) surface are other low - index stoichiometric non - polar surface terminations characterized by increasing number of uncoordinated bonds at the surface .",
    "@xcite the polar ( 111 ) surface is known to reconstruct to form two different octopolar terminations  @xcite ( metal and oxygen terminated : m - oct and o - oct ) with a @xmath16 periodicity .",
    "additionally , in the presence of water , the ( 111 ) facet can be greatly stabilized by hydroxilation of the surface .",
    "@xcite for this study , we have selected four low - index stoichiometric surface terminations under vacuum conditions namely the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and the m - oct and o - oct ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "their calculated surface energies normalized to @xmath17 unit surface area are summarized in fig .",

    "the surface energy is obtained via the linearized method of fiorentini and methfessel .",
    "@xcite slabs from 2 to 8 metal - oxide layers have been studied with a surface energy convergence within 0.01  ev , which was achieved for 4 - 6 layers .",
    "the periodic symmetric surface slabs were separated by 16   of vacuum , cleaved at bulk geometries and fully relaxed within fixed unit cells bellow maximum threshold force of 0.05  ev /  . to be noted",
    "is that the hse investigation of the ( 111 ) surfaces was omitted due to prohibitively large computational cost within plane - wave pwscf for the larger slabs .    for all surfaces , we find that the calculated surface energy decreases monotonically along the series from mgo to bao , as has been attributed previously to a loss of madelung energy , which is largest for mgo .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the energy differences between the facets also decrease along the series .",
    "this observation has strong implications for the surface morphology of aemos , with bao having much larger probability of having different facets exposed than mgo , as first pointed out by broqvist _",
    "et al_.  @xcite we also find , that the surface energies of the two octopolar ( 111 ) terminations fall in - between the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces . for mgo",

    "al_.@xcite interestingly , the stability between the o - oct and m - oct ( 111 ) surfaces is reversed for the rest of the aemo series ( see lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : surface_energy ] ) . for a given metal - oxide",
    ", the ordering of stabilities between the individual surfaces approximately corresponds to coordination loss per surface metal site , which is 1/6 for ( 100 ) , 1.5/6 on average for ( 111 ) m - oct ( same for o - site in o - oct termination ) and 2/6 for ( 110 ) .    .",

    "[ tab : table1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we discuss the above mentioned observation that co adsorbs marginally ( @xmath180.05 ev ) weaker on bao(100 ) than on mgo(100 ) , while no adsorbs substantially stronger ( @xmath180.1 ev ) on bao(100 ) than on mgo(100 ) .",
    "the analysis is based on representative results obtained with the beef - vdw functional .",
    "we have chosen the beef - vdw functional due to its predictability of the co and no adsorption on the mgo(100 ) surface . in order to understand the reasons behind differences in chemical bonding ,",
    "it is instructive to plot the charge density difference ( cdd ) upon adsorption .",
    "this quantity is obtained as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are self - consistent densities of the adsorbate , surface and of the combined system , respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been calculated based on the fixed geometry of the combined system to allow for identification of true electronic effects and avoid geometric effects .",
    "figures  [ fig : coddplot ] and  [ fig : noddplot ] show the cdds for co and no on the ( 100 ) surface of mgo and bao . for the adsorbed co molecule",
    ", @xmath23 depicts polarization in the @xmath2 channel , which is about twice as large for mgo than for bao .",
    "this is also quantitatively supported from the calculated bader charges as indicated in figs  [ fig : coddplot ] and  [ fig : noddplot ] . for the adsorbed no molecule , on the other hand , the overall change in the density due to adsorption is much larger than the one for co. both cdd plots for adsorbed no are dominated by polarization in the @xmath3 channel . in contrast to the co cases , the polarization is stronger for bao than for mgo . hence , we conclude that the change in polarization is a good measure of the adsorption strength for the aemos .",
    "we find that the intramolecular co bond length essentially remains unchanged for upon adsorption on both mgo and bao relative to its gas phase value of @xmath24   for beef - vdw , while it is marginally shorter for geometries obtained with the hse functional .",
    "this also indicates a small repulsive interaction in the @xmath2 channel , which often has been observed upon co adsorption on pure metals .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the elongation of the internal no bond is clearly visible for bao : @xmath25   ( mgo : @xmath26   ) when compared to the bond of gas phase no molecule @xmath27   ( beef - vdw functional ) .",
    "this observation is consistent with the picture of @xmath3-back donation to the no molecule , which is similar to the case of no@ru(001 ) and no@nio(100 ) .",
    "@xcite        the projected density of states ( pdos ) for co and no on the ( 100 ) surface of mgo and bao are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : copdos ] . for the adsorbed co ,",
    "the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 adsorbate states are very similar to the ones of the gas - phase co molecule . only a small hybridization with the states of the surface ba(@xmath31 ) atoms",
    "is observed . the change in intensity of the carbon @xmath29 state for co@mgo(100 )",
    "is also detected , although its value is likely underestimated due to the small radii employed in the atomic orbital projectors .",
    "overall , the shifts in the position of the peaks are larger for co@mgo(100 ) than for co@bao(100 ) , in agreement with the larger polarization found in the charge density differences ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coddplot ] ) .",
    "for adsorbed no , the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 adsorbate states are significantly more hybridized than for adsorbed co. we find that the larger tilting angle ( @xmath32 ) of the no towards the mgo(100 ) surface leads to a lift of the degeneracy between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 states .",
    "a small hybridization of the @xmath35 state with the surfaces and a reordering of the @xmath30 state relative to the @xmath29 state in the minority spin channel is also observed . for no@bao(100 ) , the significantly smaller tilting angle ( @xmath36 ) of the no molecule is not sufficient to lift the @xmath37 degeneracy .",
    "however , the @xmath28 and @xmath35 states are significantly more hybridized with the states of the ba(@xmath31 ) and o(@xmath4 ) surface atoms .",
    "the relative ordering of the @xmath30 to @xmath29 is reversed within both spin channels .",
    "again , we find overall larger hybridization and shifts in the states for no@bao(100 ) than for no@mgo(100 ) , which is consistent with the picture of a larger polarization observed in the density difference ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coddplot ] ) .",
    "in other words , the differences in adsorption of co and no on the mgo(100 ) and bao(100 ) surfaces can be rationalized from the electronic structure .      , for adsorbate coverage @xmath38 , on the surfaces of the aemo series shown as function of surface energy . as in fig .",

    "another very important property of an oxide surface is its reactivity towards oxygen .",
    "we have investigated oxygen adsorption energy dependence on different surface sites of the aemo surfaces as well as the formation of oxygen vacancies .",
    "for the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces , in addition to direct on - top adsorption , we have identified two more stable configurations : the metal - metal bridge sites as well as in metal - oxygen - metal ( mom ) sites , in which an o@xmath1-like structure is formed ( shown as inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_surf ] ) .",
    "the energetic map of adsorption for studied surfaces of the aemo series is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_surf ] . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_surf ] , we report the calculated oxygen vacancy formation energies , more specifically the formation energies for the neutral surface f centers . it is customary to define the oxygen adsorption energy @xmath40 and oxygen vacancy formation energy @xmath41 relative to gas phase o@xmath1 as @xmath42 .",
    "note , that a straightforward conversion to atomic oxygen as reference can be obtained by subtracting half of its experimental atomization energy ( 5.21  ev ) .",
    "an alternative definition is possible by using water and hydrogen as reference  @xcite as follows @xmath43 , which leads to only a small constant shift ( @xmath18 0.1 ev ) in observed values . as in the co and",
    "no calculations , we employed identical 4 layer slab models and @xmath44 simulation cells .",
    "for the ( 111 ) surfaces , the oxygen adsorption energy is calculated at the on - top metal site for the m - oct termination , while the oxygen vacancy formation is calculated by oxygen removal from the o - oct terminated surface .",
    "we find that the adsorption at the on - top metal site on any surface is very weak , with adsorbed oxygen maintaining its triplet spin state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_surf ] ) .",
    "a stronger adsorption is found for the oxygen on the bridge sites of the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces by about 0.6  ev and for these systems some residual spin polarization remains on the adsorbed oxygen .",
    "the most stable adsorption site on the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces is the mom site , which is about 1  ev more stable than the on - top site .",
    "adsorbed oxygen at the mom site forms a stretched o@xmath1-like structure , which is further stabilized by the surrounding metal atoms ( shown as inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_surf ] ) . in this case , the magnetic moment of the oxygen is fully quenched by the surface .",
    "the calculated oxygen vacancy formation energies are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_surf ] .",
    "for all the studied oxide surfaces , we find that the final electronic configuration of the oxygen vacancy is the same as for the singlet - type neutral f - center .",
    "the geometric structure of the local adsorption environment plays a crucial role in the interaction between oxygen and surface .",
    "the two surfaces with higher surface energies have also a higher number of uncoordinated bonds when compared to the ( 100 ) surface and the oxygen generally adsorbs stronger on them , as we discussed above .",
    "we find a similar inverse effect for the oxygen vacancy formation energy , that is the formation energy decreases for less stable surfaces relative to the ( 100 ) surface .",
    "however , its clear that the surface energy is only a weak indicator of the oxygen reactivity in these systems .",
    "the electronic structure differences between the oxides of the aemo series are also clearly visible . for a given adsorption site",
    ", the adsorption is strengthened along the aemo series , similar to what we found for no adsorption on the ( 100 ) surface .",
    "for the mom site , this gain is as large as 1.5  ev , _",
    "i.e. _ , the adsorption energy difference between o@mgo(100 ) and o@bao(100 ) .",
    "a comparison between the density of states of o adsorbed on mgo(100 ) and bao(100 ) ( not shown ) indicates a much larger hybridization between o@xmath45 and bao states .",
    "for vacancy formation , we observe destabilization of the vacancy as the co - valency of the oxide increases .",
    "this is reasonable , since the extra electron pair in the vacancy gives rise to strong madelung stabilization ,  @xcite which is largest for mgo and decreases along the series .",
    "@xcite    the adsorption calculations of o on the mom sites for the different dft functionals reveal the familiar ordering and energy range and bounds as observed for the no and co adsorption , that is , rpbe yielding a too weak and lda a too strong binding . the variation in the adsorption energies is as large as 0.8  ev . within these bounds , @xmath46 is ordered as @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath39 has a similar ordering as @xmath46 . while we were unable to find any experimental or calculated oxygen adsorption energies , our vacancy formation energy of 6.28  ev for mgo(100 ) within hse functional agrees very well with the recently published hse value of 6.34  ev .",
    "@xcite interestingly , the rpa results predict too strong oxygen binding oxygen adsorption and too large vacancy formation energies , which are very close to lda results .",
    "this finding is independent of oxygen reference or hardness of oxygen pseudopotential indicating the inability of rpa to capture missing correlation under change of electron pairs ( from triplet to singlet ) .",
    "@xcite     in ( 110 ) and o - oct ( 111 ) surfaces relative to @xmath39 of ( 100 ) surfaces .",
    "inset : similar linear dependence between on - top @xmath46 and @xmath39 using only the pbe data of fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_surf ] . ]",
    "finally , we discuss the relations and correlations of the oxygen chemistry between different aemos that we have identified . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_ovac ] we show that an approximate linear relation exists between the vacancy formation energies of the different aemos surfaces and the vacancy formation energies of the ( 100 ) surfaces .",
    "this is of utter importance , since the vacancy formation energy of a less stable surface can be predicted based on the vacancy formation of the most stable surface .",
    "additionally , we also find a linear relation between on - top oxygen adsorption energies and surface formation energies , shown as inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : oads_vs_ovac ] .",
    "hence , a good estimate of the oxygen adsorption energetics can be established with the knowledge of only the oxygen vacancy formation of the ( 100 ) surfaces .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed a thorough computational study of the surface chemistry of alkaline - earth transition - metal oxides ( mgo , cao , sro , and bao ) using different dft functionals ( lda , pbe , rpbe , pbesol , beef - vdw ) and rpa methods , and benchmarked our results with existing experimental values .",
    "the most important factors determining the surface properties of aemos have either an electronic or structural origin .",
    "we find that the electronic effects are responsible for ordering of adsorption energies within the aemo series and structural effects are responsible for ordering between different facets for a given aemo .    for surface energies , the rpa methods and the pbesol functional provide the most accurate predictions compared to experiments .",
    "the best performing dft functionals for the surface adsorption energetics on mgo(100 ) are found to be the beef - vdw functional and hybrid rpa method mostly due to direct incorporation of long - range interactions . a complete mapping of adsorption energetics on the aemo surfaces using the co and no as probing molecules reveals a a stronger adsorption of no relative to co , which is attributed to much larger polarization in the @xmath3 channel of the bond between the no and the surface .",
    "finally , we establish an internal hierarchy in the oxygen chemistry of different aemo surfaces , which include the ( 100 ) , the ( 110 ) , and the oxygen and metal terminated ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "the oxygen vacancy formation energetics of all surfaces are found to be linearly correlated to the energies of the most stable ( 100 ) surfaces . in addition , we find that there is a linear relation between oxygen adsorption energies and the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the ( 100 ) surfaces .",
    "this leaves us with a scheme , at least to a first order , to approximate the reactivity of different aemo surfaces based only on the calculated oxygen vacancy formation energies of the ( 100 ) surfaces .",

    "<S> we present a systematic theoretical investigation of the surface properties , stability and reactivity , of rock - salt type alkaline - earth metal oxides including mgo , cao , sro , and bao . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of commonly used exchange - correlation density functionals ( lda , pbe , rpbe , pbesol , beef - vdw and hybrid hse ) and random - phase approximation ( rpa ) is evaluated and compared to existing experimental values . calculated surface energies of the four most stable surface facets under vacuum conditions : the ( 100 ) surface , </S>",
    "<S> the metal and oxygen terminated octopolar ( 111 ) , and the ( 110 ) surfaces exhibit a monotonic increase in stability from mgo to bao . on the mgo(100 ) </S>",
    "<S> surface , adsorption of co , no , ch@xmath0 is characterized by physisorption while h@xmath1o chemisorbs , which is in agreement with experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> we further use the on - top metal adsorption of co and no molecules to map out the surface energetics of each alkaline - earth metal oxide surface . </S>",
    "<S> the considered functionals all qualitatively predict similar adsorption energy trends . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering between the adsorption energies on different surface facets can be attributed to differences in the local geometrical surface structure and the electronic structure of the metal constituent of the alkaline - earth metal oxide . </S>",
    "<S> the striking observation that co adsorption strength is weaker than no adsorption on the ( 100 ) terraces as the period of the alkaline - earth metal in the oxide increases , is analyzed in detail in terms of charge redistribution within the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels of adsorbates . finally , we also present oxygen adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation energies in these oxide systems . </S>"
