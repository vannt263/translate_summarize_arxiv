    "quantum error correction has been proposed to combat the effect of noise @xcite , and loss - tolerant metrology protocols have been designed and implemented to address some of the negative effects of dissipation @xcite . it has been shown that the measurement of @xmath0 phases in an interferometer can obtain an improvement of a factor @xmath1 in the precision when multi - mode entanglement is used @xcite .",
    "this behavior persists in the presence of photon loss @xcite , even though multi - mode entanglement is highly susceptible to such processes @xcite .",
    "when the loss parameters are also estimated , there is a trade - off between the attainable precision of the phase estimation and the estimation of these parameters @xcite .",
    "however , loss and noise are not the only causes for imperfect metrology .",

    ", one containing a number of individual sensors  will be limited by the presence of such nuisance parameters , but this aspect of quantum metrology has been somewhat overlooked .    in this paper , we address the problem of nuisance parameters arising from unwanted couplings between sensors in practical quantum parameter estimation .",
    "such couplings affect the measurement precision  defined by the mean square error ( mse)and must also be estimated , even if we are ultimately not interested in their numerical value @xcite . for a single parameter , the quantum cramr - rao bound ( qcrb )",
    "puts a lower limit on the mse , determined by the inverse of the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xcite .",
    "multiple parameters lead to a qfi matrix , the inverse of which provides lower bounds for the mse covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "nuisance parameters are part of this multi - parameter estimation problem .",
    "while the qcrb for a single parameter can generally be attained , this is not always true of the qcrb for multiple parameters @xcite .",
    "where multiple parameters are being estimated , it matters whether the generators of translation of the parameters commute or not , with implications for the optimal strategies of the parameter estimation procedures @xcite .",
    "even though multi - mode entanglement can be used to improve the estimation of multiple phase parameters beyond the classical snl @xcite , this is not always the case .",
    "for the example considered in this paper , we show that the optimum entanglement is a function of the nuisance parameters being estimated and that  for a range of parameter values with practical relevance  the presence of entanglement can be detrimental to the estimation process .    .",

    "these results are valid for a wide range of physically relevant parameter values , and we indicate how the calibration process can be generalized to a set of three sagnac interferometers measuring arbitrary three dimensional rotation rates .    the misalignment of gyroscopic sensors is a well - known problem in the construction of inertial navigation systems  @xcite .",
    "fibre - optical sagnac interferometers are often used in modern `` strapdown '' inertial navigation systems ( i.e. fixed sensors within the body of the navigation system )  @xcite . in such systems , three fibre - optical gyroscopes ( fogs ) and three accelerometers are mounted in the inertial measurement unit of the navigation system .",
    "the gyroscopes provide measurements of the rotation rates about their axes , where the axes are normally designed to form an orthogonal triad .",
    "integrating the rotation rates provides estimates of the angles of rotation of the system , relative to a set of reference axes .",
    "the angles are used to determine the system s orientation , but they are also used to resolve the measured accelerations into the reference axes to determine the system s translational motion ( i.e. velocity and position ) . as a result ,",
    "the accuracy of the gyroscopic sensors is often a limiting factor in the overall performance of an inertial navigation system .",
    "the gyroscopes will have mis - alignment errors due to mechanical tolerances in their construction and systematic errors in the measurement devices , both of which limit the accuracy of the sensors . calibrating these errors , and correcting for them in software , is one way to improve the accuracy of the inertial navigation system , and this has become standard practice in many applications  @xcite .",

    "this means that an adaptive calibration method should be feasible , although the precise form that it should take will depend on the criteria being optimized and the quality of the a priori knowledge regarding the rotation rates applied to the system , and the corresponding sagnac phase measurements .",
    "ideally , the calibration would be performed using a rotation rate that had been selected to produce a minimum variance for the parameter estimates , and these vary significantly , as can be seen in table  [ tab : stats ] .",

    "here we give a simple argument that shows that the calibration process for quantum interferometers can be generalized to three dimensions in a straightforward way .",
    "consider the three axes determined by three sagnac gyroscopes .",
    "we pick one axis as a reference axis  such as the @xmath7-axis in the discussion above .",
    "the remaining two axes deviate from a perfect triad in three angles , namely the angles for the @xmath10 and @xmath8-axes with the @xmath7-axis , and the angle between the @xmath10-axis and the @xmath8-axis .",
    "these are three nuisance parameters @xmath148 ( now a three - dimensional vector ) arising from the physical tolerances inherent in any manufacturing process .",
    "calibration requires that we determine these angles with high precision . during operation ,",
    "any sagnac phase measurements can be corrected by removing the coupling introduced by the nuisance parameters in post - processing .",
    "the calibration consists of applying a well - defined rotation rate to the system , fixed with respect to an external frame , which leads to expected values of the phases @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we must estimate these phases with the gyroscope .",
    "we then rotate the gyroscope sensor through a known angle and repeat the measurements with the same rotation rate applied . for each independent",
    "set of phase measurements we take three readings , namely the photon number difference in @xmath10 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the question is now if we can take enough _ different _ readings by applying these known rotations to the three - dimensional gyroscope several times , taking into account that each finite rotation is itself associated with a nuisance parameter , such as the parameter @xmath38 above .",
    "if we take @xmath149 sets of readings , after each rotation about an arbitrary angle , @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) , we introduce  in principle  three new nuisance parameters for each @xmath152 .",
    "it is easy to see that the total number of parameters stays ahead of the total number of readings by three , and we will not be able to establish all parameter values unambiguously . to overcome this problem , we rotate the gyroscope around the same externally defined axis that determine the calibration signal @xmath153 .",
    "this will incur only a single nuisance parameter for every rotation ( after the first set of measurements ) , namely the rotation angle , and it still allows us to rotate the gyroscope in any direction we wish .",
    "suppose we take a set of measurements in @xmath149 gyroscope orientations .",
    "we will have the three components of the applied rotation rate , three angles corresponding to the mis - alignment of the sagnac axes , plus @xmath154 rotation angles , giving a total of @xmath155 parameters that need to be estimated from @xmath156 measurements of the sagnac phases .",
    "a successful calibration therefore requires @xmath157 which means that we need at least three sets of measurements .",
    "if we then wish to relate the gyroscope orientation to an external reference frame we need another three parameters , and this can be achieved by taking another set of measurements at a fourth orientation .",
    "this analysis implies that the generalisation of our analysis to three dimensions does not pose a major obstacle  which is to be expected since similar processes are already used in inertial navigation systems and can include more complicated sequences of rotations and applied rotation rates to characterize other errors  @xcite  and there is no reason to believe that the main results given above for entangled input states would simplify significantly in moving from two to three dimensions .",
    "if anything , the optimisation of the input states in three dimensions would be expected to be an even more complicated problem than the case presented here .",
    "we have studied the role of entanglement in the calibration and operation of an optical quantum gyroscope , relying on measurements of the sagnac phase shift .",
    "the accuracy of the gyroscope is an important factor in inertial navigation systems , and any imperfections in the system must be well characterized for reliable operation as a rotation sensor .",
    "the interferometers are sensitive to rotation rates , which must be integrated with respect to time to generate orientation information , which can then be used to resolve acceleration measurements into a reference frame , thereby allowing changes in velocity and position to be determined .    for a perfectly aligned gyroscope ,",
    "the optimal state in each individual interferometer will be highly entangled , noon states for example , with no entanglement or other correlations between the interferometers .",
    "the sagnac phase measurements are essentially independent , and the quantum cramr - rao bound can be achieved asymptotically . when the interferometers are not perfectly orthogonal to each other , the appearance of nuisance parameters ( the mis - alignment of the sensors ) will give rise to couplings between the measured values for the rotation rates . knowing the values of these nuisance parameters",
    "allows the effect of these couplings to be reduced or removed , thereby improving the accuracy of the system . to this end",
    ", the system must be calibrated by taking readings from the gyroscope in a variety of known orientations . in two dimensions",
    ", we have demonstrated that the optimal states for such systems are dependent on the values of the nuisance parameters and the condition that is being optimized . specifically , the states that would be optimal for the operation of the gyroscope as a sensor  i.e .",
    "the states that minimize the variance of the phase measurements  can be different to states that optimize the calibration of the nuisance parameters .",
    "in fact , the calibration of the optical quantum gyroscope is complicated by the fact that the variances of our estimators depend strongly on the values of the various parameters in the problem . in addition",
    ", we have found that the precision of the measurements of both the nuisance parameters and the applied signal is highly dependent on the amount of entanglement , as indicated by the correlation coefficient @xmath122 .",
    "these dependencies must be fully understood , as the use of suboptimal probe states can make the calibration worse .",
    "small improvements in the estimation of the nuisance parameters may seem to come at the expense of hard to engineer quantum probe states , but the nature of error accumulation in inertial navigation means that even modest gains in accuracy can lead to an important operational improvement of slower error divergence .",
    "an important open question is how to establish the optimal quantum strategy for the calibration of the optical quantum gyroscope : what are the optimal quantum states to send into the three interferometers , and how should we divide our resources between the different probe states ?",
    "even when the measured observables commute , it is not immediately clear how the probe states must be chosen in order to maximise the information gain about the different parameters in the gyroscope .",
    "these questions will be addressed in future work .",
