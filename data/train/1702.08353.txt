    "radio pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit beams of radio waves from regions above their magnetic poles .",
    "popular theories of the emission mechanism require continuous electron - positron pair production , with the potential responsible for accelerating the particles being inversely related to the spin period .",

    "moreover , under the usual model assumptions , based on the neutron - star equations of state , this slowly rotating pulsar should not be emitting a radio beam .",

    "it becomes clear that sgr represent a very rare and very special type of objects , which produce bursts much more powerful , than it was thought before from comparison with quakes in crab nebula pulsar . besides , the sgr are the only sources for which the nuclear explosions could be applied , because the energy release in the cosmological grb highly exceed the energy store in the non - equilibrium layer .",
    "it was suggested by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2012,2015 ) , bisnovatyi - kogan and ikhsanov ( 2014 ) , that the property , making the sgr neutron star so different from much more numerous of them in radio pulsars , single and binary x ray sources , is connected with the value of their mass , but not the magnetic field strength , see camilo ( 2000 ) , mclaughlin ( 2003 ) , and section [ radio ] .",

    "x - ray radiation of sgr / axp in quiescent states was explained by bisnovatyi - kogan and ikhsanov ( 2014 ) as a fall back accretion from the disk with a large scale poloidal magnetic field , what could also be a trigger for development of instability , leading to the mixing in the neutron star envelope , and nuclear explosion of the matter from the non - equilibrium layer .",
