    "in such a galaxy - igm ecosystem context , galaxies are described as a slowly evolving system ( i.e.  quasi - equilibrium  model ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , where the galaxies acquire gas from cosmic large - scale filamentary structures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) which activate star formation , lose gas by strong and ubiquitous outflows which regulate star formation , and again acquire the gas returned from the halo ( i.e. wind recycling ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the @xmath81 relations predicted by the ems without @xmath72 or @xmath88 become flat , similar to the predictions of the sims .",
    "the observations indicate that the @xmath81 or @xmath29 relations are similar to the predictions of the em and sams at higher redshifts , while these relations are similar to the sims at lower redshifts .",
    "the virial shock heating is expected to be included in the sims naturally , but agn feedback is implemented as an ad - hoc model . if the observed @xmath85 evolution in the high - mass range of @xcite is correct , our comparison suggests a more drastic redshift evolution of agn feedback than the sims , i.e. a stronger agn feedback for a high redshift and a weaker one for a low redshift .",
    "however , the details regarding the modelling of agn feedback are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "some recent studies have emphasised the relevance of the feedback processes , which suppress star formation while simultaneously preserving the cold gas @xcite .",
    "our results showed that the ems and the sams tend to underestimate @xmath85 or @xmath22 in less massive and massive galaxies .",
    "there is a larger gap between the observations and theoretical predictions for less massive galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar_fmol_allfb3]a ( @xmath81 relation ) than in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar_fmol_allfb2]a ( @xmath29 relation ) .",
    "this larger gap in @xmath85 in less massive galaxies suggests a lot of ejection of cold gas by sn feedback modeled in the theoretical studies .",
    "the gap may be reduced if we consider the suppression of h@xmath12 formation instead of the ejection of total cold gas .",
    "@xcite implemented a star formation law with a feedback depending on galaxy - scale mean dust opacity and metallicity in sam and succeeded in reproducing the faint - end slopes of galaxy luminosity functions at @xmath21 with a _",
    "reasonable _ strength of the sn feedback . in their model ,",
    "star formation in less massive galaxies is suppressed because such galaxies tend to have lower metallicity , lower surface density , and thus , lower h@xmath12 fraction . for massive galaxies ,",
    "morphological quenching is one of the important processes , which can quench star formation even in the presence of a gas component .",
    "@xcite showed that star formation is suppressed once the central spheroidal component becomes sufficiently massive to stabilise the galactic disc against local gravitational instability .",
    "some observational studies suggested that morphological quenching is in action in the early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "galaxy formation models are constructed so as to reproduce the observed smf of galaxies by blowing out and/or heating up the cold - gas component to quench further star formation , particularly in less massive and massive systems . to investigate whether the current galaxy formation models also reproduce the observed properties of the cold - gas component of galaxies , we compare the observed and theoretically predicted evolution of the molecular gas fraction with respect to the total baryonic mass as a function of stellar mass ( i.e. the @xmath6 or @xmath29 relations ) . our main findings are as follows :    1 .",
    "the evolution of the observed @xmath6 relation shows a stellar - mass dependent evolution ; massive galaxies have largely depleted their molecular gas at @xmath5 , whereas less massive galaxies tend to convert molecular gas into stars in the regime of @xmath89 .",
    "2 .   the current cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytical models for galaxy formation succeed in ` qualitatively ' reproducing the @xmath29 relation evolution in the regime of @xmath33 where less massive galaxies are always more gas - rich than massive galaxies . 3 .",
    "there is a non - negligible gap between the observed and theoretically predicted @xmath29 relations .",
    "the predicted @xmath4 value is more than two times smaller than the observed value at most , particularly in less massive ( @xmath7 m@xmath8 ) and massive galaxies ( @xmath9 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "accordingly , for this gap , the use of feedback models could be required , which quench star formation but retain the cold - gas component .",
    "the observed redshift evolution of the cold gas mass fraction in massive galaxies suggests a more drastic evolution of agn feedback than the one implemented in the hydrodynamic simulations , i.e. a stronger agn feedback in higher redshift ( @xmath90 ) and a weaker one in lower redshift ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the smf of galaxies alone is not sufficient for constraining the galaxy formation models and the @xmath6 relation forms one of the important observational constraints on feedback processes implemented in galaxy - formation models .",
    "it is to be noted that we adopted the indirect estimates of @xmath4 using the optical survey data @xcite for comparison with the galaxy formation models in this study . to form a definitive conclusion regarding the @xmath4 evolution of galaxies ( particularly less massive and massive galaxies ) , it is necessary to directly measure the cold gas mass of galaxies over wide ranges of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "the mass function of the stellar component is of course a basic observed constraint , which must be satisfied for the models .",
    "the cold - gas component is also an important component in the baryonic cycle of galaxies .",
    "a combination of the observational constraints on stellar and cold gas components will aid in sketching a complete scenario of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "observations with forthcoming facilities such as the alma , the noema , and the ska , will allow us to explore the statistical properties and evolution of cold - gas components in galaxies , such as @xmath11 and h@xmath12 mass functions , as well as the @xmath6 relation .",
