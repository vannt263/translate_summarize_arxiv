    "the initial angular momentum of the thermal component is small , comprising some @xmath102 of the total angular momentum of the field , and so any heating of the field due to the redistribution of the associated rotational energy is possibly too small to resolve above the uncertainty in the temperature estimates .",

    "we intuitively expect the rate at which the trap dissipates the angular momentum of the thermal cloud to depend strongly on the magnitude of the anisotropy , and a quantitative model for this dependence in the case of a classical ( boltzmann ) gas was presented in @xcite . by contrast , the efficiency with which the thermal cloud extracts angular momentum from the condensate is dictated by the ( longitudinal ) mutual - friction coefficient , which depends on the temperature and chemical potential of the field , in addition to its microscopic properties @xcite .",

    "the decomposition of the field into condensed and noncondensed components must therefore be viewed with some caution in this strongly nonequilibrium scenario .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the effect of the trap on the cloud dominates the vortex - cloud coupling in this scenario , in stark contrast to the near - adiabatic decay scenario of sec .",
    "[ subsec : weak_damping ] .",
    "we now consider the dependence of the relaxation times on the strength of the trap anisotropy . as",
    "the relaxation of both the condensate and the thermal cloud is generally nonexponential , we consider the times at which the condensate becomes irrotational , and at which the total angular momentum of the field is lost . due to the persistence of surface excitations which prevent the condensate angular momentum from reaching zero ,",
    "we define the condensate stopping time @xmath127 as that at which the angular momentum of the condensate first drops below @xmath128 per particle , and the field stopping time as the first _ subsequent _ time @xmath129 at which the cloud angular momentum reaches zero .",

[ fig : relaxation ] ) vary by two orders of magnitude over the range of trap anisotropies we consider .",
    "moreover , the total - field relaxation times ( plusses ) become increasingly longer than the vortex relaxation times as the trap anisotropy is weakened , causing slower dissipation of the cloud angular momentum even in the absence of the vortex .",
    "we therefore consider the time @xmath130 over which the angular momentum of the cloud dissipates following the expulsion of the vortex .",
    "although the angular momentum lost in this final damping phase varies over the range @xmath131 , precluding a precise analysis , the times @xmath132 provide a useful characterization of the dependence of the cloud relaxation on the trap anisotropy .",
    "we perform a linear fit to @xmath133 as a function of @xmath110 in log - log space ( inset to fig .  [",

    "we have carried out the first simulations of the arrest of a rotating bose - einstein condensate due to the presence of a trap anisotropy which includes the coupled nonequilibrium dynamics of the condensate and thermal cloud .",
    "our method makes no assumptions of stationarity of a thermal bath , nor are the two components artificially given disparate rotational parameters .",
    "rather , our approach describes the dynamical migration of an _ equilibrium _ rotating thermal state to a new , irrotational equilibrium , solely due to the action of the trapping potential .",
    "we observe for all parameters we considered that the rotation rates of the condensate and thermal component are distinct during the decay .",
    "the anomalous rotational response of the precessing - vortex condensate can lead to a counter - intuitive spin - up of the thermal component during the decay , and we observe nonequilibrium oscillations in transfer of angular momentum between the two components as the vortex responds to the dissipative effect of the thermal cloud , which is itself damped by the trapping potential anisotropy .    for trap anisotropies that are weak , the thermal field settles to a nonequilibrium steady state , with rotation rate intermediate between that of the condensate and that of the ( static ) trap . in this scenario the angular momentum of the condensate",
    "is slowly depleted while that of the thermal cloud remains nearly constant , until the vortex nears the condensate boundary and the linearity of the vortex decay breaks down . for stronger trap anisotropies ,",
    "the angular momentum of the thermal cloud may be almost entirely depleted before the condensate responds .",
    "we quantified the heating of the atomic field during the arrest , and found it to be commensurate with the conversion of rotational kinetic energy into thermal energy by the trap anisotropy .",
    "we also considered the time scales over which the condensate angular momentum and total field angular momentum were dissipated , and found reasonable agreement between the scaling of the thermal cloud spin - down time with trap anisotropy and the predictions of a boltzmann gas model @xcite .",
    "possible extensions of this work include the description of vortex - lattice arrest , and the effects of temperature on the decay dynamics .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to study how the nonequilibrium rotational dynamics of the condensate approach those of a rigid body as the vortex density increases , and the effect of temperature on the cloud rotation in the steady - state scenario .",
