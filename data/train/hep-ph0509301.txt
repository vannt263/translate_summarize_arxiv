    "the implementation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the energy region populated by light - flavoured resonances ( @xmath3 , being @xmath4 the mass of the @xmath5 ) is a demanding task that involves poorly known aspects such as bound and resonant states , duality and hadronization mechanisms .",
    "though _ ad hoc _ breit - wigner parameterisations have been widely employed in the literature @xcite they are not necessarily consistent with the underlying theory , as they seem to violate the chiral symmetry of massless qcd @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 decays into hadrons allow to study the hadronization properties of vector and axial - vector qcd currents and , accordingly , to determine intrinsic properties of the dynamics generated by resonances @xcite . at very low energies , typically @xmath6 ,",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt ) @xcite is the effective field theory of qcd .",
    "still the @xmath1 decays , through their full energy spectrum , are driven by the @xmath8 and @xmath2 resonances mainly , in an energy region where the invariant hadron momentum approaches the masses of the resonances .",
    "hence @xmath7pt is no longer applicable to the study of the whole spectrum but only to the very low energy domain @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure that has been followed @xcite to deal with these decays has been to modulate the amplitudes with a breit - wigner parameterization , fixing the normalization in order to match the leading @xmath9 @xmath7pt . nevertheless , its deviation of the chiral behaviour at higher orders @xcite could spoil any outcome provided by the analysis of data .    lately several experiments have collected good quality data on @xmath1 , such as branching ratios and spectra @xcite or structure functions @xcite .",
    "their analysis within a model - independent framework is highly desirable if one wishes to collect information on the hadronization of the relevant qcd currents .",
    "at energies @xmath10 the resonance mesons are active degrees of freedom that have to be properly included into the pertinent lagrangian .",
    "the procedure , put forward in refs .",
    "@xcite and known as resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath7 t ) , is ruled by the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd , that drives the interaction of goldstone bosons ( the lightest octet of pseudoscalar mesons ) , and the @xmath11 assignments of the resonance multiplets .",
    "this construction is embedded within a comprehensive framework guided by the large number of colours ( @xmath12 ) limit of qcd @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 expansion tells us that , at leading order , we should only consider the tree level diagrams given by a local lagrangian with infinite zero - width states in the spectrum .",
    "this is precisely the role of r@xmath7 t .",
    "however in most processes , like hadron tau decays , we need to include finite widths that only appear at next - to - leading order in the large-@xmath12 expansion and , moreover , we will only include one multiplet of vector and axial - vector resonances in our theory .",
    "thus , in practice , we have to model this large-@xmath12 expansion to some extent .",
    "the final hadron system in the @xmath1 decays spans a wide energy region , namely @xmath14 that is populated by many resonances .",
    "r@xmath7 t is the appropriate framework to work with and we consider the lagrangian @xcite  : @xmath15 where all the couplings are real , being @xmath16 the decay constant of the pion in the chiral limit , and the operators @xmath17 are given by  : @xmath18 \\ ,   \\chi_- \\ , \\rangle \\ ; \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal o}^2_{\\rm vap } & = & i\\,\\langle \\ , [ \\ , v^{\\mu\\nu } \\ , , \\ ,   a_{\\nu\\alpha } \\ , ] \\ , h_\\mu^{\\;\\alpha } \\ , \\rangle \\ ; \\ ; , \\\\ { \\cal o}^3_{\\rm vap } & = &   i \\,\\langle \\ , [ \\ , \\nabla^\\mu v_{\\mu\\nu } \\ , , \\ ,   a^{\\nu\\alpha}\\ , ] \\ ,",

    "notice that we are using the antisymmetric tensor formulation to describe the spin @xmath19 resonances and , consequently , we do not consider the @xmath20 @xmath7pt lagrangian of goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "our lagrangian theory has eight a priori unknown coupling constants , namely @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "phenomenology could provide direct information on them ; for instance @xmath21 could be extracted from the measured @xmath26 , @xmath23 from @xmath27 , @xmath22 from @xmath28 and the @xmath24 appear in @xmath29 or the @xmath30 processes themselves .",
    "it is conspicuous , though , that @xmath31 is not qcd for arbitrary values of the couplings .",
    "hence if we want to comprehend more about qcd in this non - perturbative regime we should try to learn about the determination of the couplings from the underlying theory @xcite . on this account",
    "we will implement several known features of the strong interaction theory in the following .",
    "the qcd ruled short  distance behaviour of the vector and axial - vector form factors in the large@xmath12 limit ( approximated with only one octet of vector resonances ) constrains the couplings of @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ret ] ) , which must satisfy @xcite  : @xmath33 in addition , the first weinberg sum rule , in the limit where only the lowest narrow resonances contribute to the vector and axial  vector spectral functions , leads to @xmath34 in this way all three couplings @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath22 can be written in terms of the pion decay constant  : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these results are well satisfied phenomenologically and we have adopted them . in the next section",
    "we will comment on an analogous study of the @xmath24 couplings .",
    "the decay amplitudes for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 processes can be written as @xmath41 @xmath42 as in the isospin limit there is no contribution of the vector current to these processes . in @xmath43",
    "the @xmath44 is the one in @xmath45 and @xmath46 that in @xmath47 .",
    "the hadronic tensor can be written in terms of three form factors , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as @xcite  : @xmath51 where @xmath52 the form factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 have a transverse structure in the total hadron momenta @xmath53 and drive a @xmath54 transition .",
    "bose symmetry under interchange of the two identical pions in the final state demands that @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "meanwhile @xmath50 accounts for a @xmath58 transition that carries pseudoscalar degrees of freedom and vanishes with the square of the pion mass .",
    "its contribution to the spectral function of @xmath30 goes like @xmath59 and , accordingly , it is very much suppressed with respect to that coming from @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we will not consider it in the following .    in the low @xmath60 region , the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmu1 ] ) can be calculated using @xmath7pt . at @xmath9",
    "one has two contributions , arising from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag1 ] . the sum of both graphs yields @xmath61    diagrams contributing to the hadronic amplitude @xmath62 at @xmath9 @xmath7pt . ]",
    "we now include the resonance  mediated contributions to the amplitude , to be evaluated through the interacting terms in @xmath32 eq .",
    "( [ eq : ret ] ) .",
    "the relevant diagrams to be taken into account are those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag2 ] .",
    "we get @xmath63   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\pm \\frac{4 \\ , f_a \\ , g_v}{3 \\,f^3 } \\ ,    \\frac{q^2}{q^2-m_a^2 } \\ ,    \\left [ \\beta(q^2,s , t ) \\ , v_{1 \\mu } + \\beta(q^2,t , s ) \\ , v_{2 \\mu }   \\right ] \\ ; . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     resonance  mediated diagrams contributing to @xmath62 . ]    the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are  : @xmath66 @xmath67 with @xmath68 and depend on three combinations of the @xmath24 couplings in @xmath69 , that we call @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . following the ideas outlined above we can get information on these combinations by implementing known aspects of asymptotic qcd .",
    "in particular we expect that the form factor of the axial - vector current into three pions should vanish at infinite transfer of momentum ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that its contribution to the spectral function of the axial - vector current correlator , being positive , has to add to other infinite hadronic positive contributions to reach the constant value evaluated within qcd @xcite . accordingly",
    "the proper behaviour of the @xmath62 form factor imposes the constraints  : @xmath74 hence there is only one combination of couplings left unknown , namely @xmath70 .",
    "finally an additional comment on the result for @xmath75 is required .",
    "the form factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t1r ] ) include zero ",
    "width @xmath76(770 ) and @xmath77(1260 ) propagator poles , leading to divergent phase ",
    "space integrals in the calculation of the @xmath30 decay width as the kinematical variables go along the full energy spectrum .",
    "the result can be regularized through the inclusion of resonance widths , which means to go beyond the leading order in the @xmath13 expansion , and implies the introduction of some additional theoretical inputs .",
    "this issue has been analysed in detail within the resonance chiral effective theory in ref .",
    "@xcite and , accordingly , we include off ",
    "shell widths for both resonances @xcite .",
    "to analyse the experimental data we will only consider the dominating @xmath78 driven axial  vector form factors , that satisfy @xmath79 hence providing the same predictions for both @xmath45 and @xmath47 processes in the isospin limit .",
    "hence we get the axial  vector @xmath2 parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where the errors are only statistical .",
    "we also obtain a value for the still unknown combination of @xmath24 couplings  : @xmath83 . however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this value seems too large when additional qcd constraints are imposed .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy could be the small sensitivity of the tau decay amplitude to this parameter , as it only appears multiplied by the mass of the pion ( [ eq : fq2 ] ) , together with an improvable implementation of the off - shell width of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "ultimately we predict the integrated structure functions @xmath84",
    ", @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite , that we compare with the experimental results for @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] . in spite of the large errors the predictions follow notably the depicted trend . as analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite a variance between the aleph data on one side and the opal and cleo - ii on the other are at the origin of the seemingly inconsistent result for @xmath84 in the high @xmath60 region .",
    "in conclusion it can be inferred that , within the present experimental errors and for the studied observables , there is no evidence of relevant contributions in @xmath30 decays beyond those of the @xmath5 and @xmath2 resonances .",
