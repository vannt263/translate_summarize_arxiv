    "the quark condensate @xmath5 is an order parameter of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . with increasing temperature the quark condensate decreases ( or `` melts '' ) . for low temperatures @xmath6",
    "this effect can be systematically calculated in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the estimate @xmath7mev @xcite for the critical temperature , where chiral symmetry will eventually be restored , has been found .",
    "this extrapolated value is remarkably consistent with @xmath8mev @xcite obtained in recent lattice qcd simulations ( modulo still persisting disputes between different lattice groups @xcite ) .",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath9 drops also with increasing baryon density . presently , it is not feasible to study this phenomenon rigorously in lattice qcd due to the problems arising from the complex - valued fermion determinant at non - zero quark chemical potential . as an alternative ,",
    "the density dependence of @xmath10 can be extracted by exploiting the feynman - hellmann theorem applied to the chiral symmetry breaking quark mass term @xmath11 in the qcd hamiltonian .",
    "the leading linear term in the nucleon density @xmath12 is then readily derived by differentiating the energy density of a nucleonic fermi gas , @xmath13 , with respect to the light quark mass @xmath14 .",
    "this introduces the nucleon sigma - term @xmath15mev @xcite as the driving term for the density evolution of the chiral condensate . following this leading linear density approximation",
    "one would estimate that chiral symmetry gets restored at @xmath16 , with @xmath17@xmath18 the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "corrections beyond the linear density approximation arise from the nucleon - nucleon correlations which transform the nucleonic fermi gas into a nuclear fermi liquid . because of the goldstone boson nature of the pion , with its characteristic mass relation @xmath19 ,",
    "the pion - exchange dynamics in nuclear matter plays a particularly important role for the in - medium quark condensate . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have used in - medium chiral perturbation theory to calculate systematically the corrections to the linear density approximation .",
    "this calculation has treated in detail the long- and medium - range correlations arising from @xmath20-exchange ( with @xmath21-dependent vertex corrections ) , iterated @xmath20-exchange , and irreducible @xmath2-exchange including also virtual @xmath22-isobar excitations , with pauli - blocking corrections up to three - loop order .",
    "it was furthermore necessary to estimate the quark mass dependence of a nn - contact term which encodes unresolved short - distance dynamics .",
    "employing a recent computation of the nn - potential in lattice qcd @xcite ( at three different pion masses ) we have found that the contact term has a negligible influence on the in - medium quark condensate ( in agreement with ref.@xcite which follows a somewhat different approach ) . as a result , we have obtained in ref.@xcite a strong and non - linear dependence of the `` dropping '' condensate on the actual value of the pion mass @xmath21 . in the chiral limit @xmath23 , chiral symmetry would seem to be restored already at about @xmath24 .",
    "by contrast , for the physical pion mass @xmath25mev , the in - medium condensate stabilizes at about @xmath26 of its vacuum value around that same density ( see fig.2 in the present paper ) .",
    "having found such pronounced deviations from the linear density approximation , with a hindered tendency towards chiral symmetry restoration in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter , it is a logical next step to explore the effects of the additional isospin degree of freedom present in nuclear many - body systems .",
    "such a novel study is the purpose of the present short paper where we consider the extreme isospin - asymmetric case of pure neutron matter .",
    "interestingly , we find that the same chiral pion - exchange dynamics which stabilizes the quark condensate in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter does not alter ( in a significant way ) its linear decrease in pure neutron matter ( for densities @xmath27@xmath28 ) . at the same time",
    "the behavior in the chiral limit @xmath29 changes prominently once a nonvanishing isospin - asymmetry is present in the nuclear medium .    as in ref.@xcite ,",
    "our starting point is the feynman - hellmann theorem .",
    "it relates the in - medium quark condensate @xmath30 to the quark mass derivative of the energy density of pure neutron matter .",
    "using the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath31 one obtains for the ratio of the in - medium to the vacuum quark condensate : @xmath32 with @xmath33 the neutron fermi momentum and @xmath34 the neutron density .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath35 comes from the non - interacting fermi gas including the ( relativistically improved ) kinetic energy .",
    "we mention here that @xmath36 denotes the pion decay constant in the chiral limit and @xmath37 stands for the leading linear term in the quark mass expansion of the squared pion mass .",
    "interaction contributions beyond the linear density approximation are collected in the function : @xmath38 defined as the derivative of the interaction energy per particle @xmath39 with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "note that small ( explicit ) isospin breaking effects @xcite ( in interactions etc . )",
    "are not included in our calculation .",
    "the asymmetry in isospin is entirely given by the filled fermi sea of neutrons ( and the empty one for protons ) .",
    "in this section we present analytical results for the contributions to the function @xmath40 as given by various classes of @xmath20- and @xmath2-exchange diagrams , calculated up to three - loop order in the energy density @xmath41 . at the level of individual diagrams",
    "pure neutron matter and isospin - symmetric nuclear matter differ only with respect to the ( overall ) isospin factor . in tablei",
    "several of these relative isospin factors are listed .",
    "therein , we refer to the corresponding equation for @xmath42 in ref.@xcite and prescribe to substitute the fermi momentum : @xmath43 . for completeness and clearness the remaining @xmath2-exchange contributions to @xmath40",

    "its contribution to the function @xmath40 reads : @xmath58 in comparison to eq.(20 ) in ref.@xcite only the numerical coefficient of the last @xmath59-term has changed .",
    "this comes from the different weighting of the hartree and fock contributions in neutron matter as compared to isospin - symmetric nuclear matter .",

    "we are using consistently the same parameters in the chiral limit as in our previous work @xcite , namely : @xmath60mev , @xmath61 , @xmath62gev@xmath63 and @xmath64mev . for the quark mass dependence of the short - distance dynamics ( not controlled by the underlying chiral effective field theory )",
    "we adopt the result derived in ref.@xcite via the short range part ( @xmath65fm ) of the nn - potential from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "its effect on the in - medium condensate @xmath66 is then again negligibly small .",
    "collecting all the pieces entering into eq.(1 ) , the condensate ratio @xmath67 in pure neutron matter comes out as shown by the full line in fig.1 .",
    "the dashed line therein corresponds to the linear density approximation using the empirical central value of the nucleon sigma - term , @xmath68mev @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the behavior in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter ( redisplayed in fig.2 for comparison ) the chiral pion - exchange dynamics in pure neutron matter generates only small deviations from the linear dropping of the in - medium condensate with density @xmath69 .",
    "this feature is straightforwardly explained by the reduced isospin weight factors of the @xmath2-exchange mechanisms ( @xmath1 for the dominant contributions ) .",
    "fig.3 shows separately the effects of the five classes of interaction contributions for neutron densities @xmath70@xmath18 .",

    "one observes that the effects from @xmath2-exchange cancel here almost completely such that the total result ( full line ) lies close to the @xmath20-exchange approximation ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "this behavior is markedly different from the situation in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter ( see fig.6 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "note also that all the results discussed so far refer to the physical value of the pion mass , @xmath74mev .            for the sake of completeness",
    ", we show in fig.4 the neutron matter equation of state resulting from our choice of parameters .",
    "besides the @xmath20- and @xmath2-exchange contributions described in refs.@xcite and those proportional to @xmath73 , it includes an adjusted short - distance term of the form : @xmath75gev@xmath76gev@xmath77 . for not too high neutron densities , @xmath78@xmath18 ,",
    "our perturbative calculation reproduces fairly well the result of the urbana group @xcite based on a sophisticated many - body calculation . at higher neutron densities",
    "we get ( as in ref.@xcite ) a stiffer neutron matter equation of state .",
    "this has to do with a repulsive @xmath79-term generated by the @xmath2-exchange three - neutron interaction .",
    "note however that this @xmath79-term drops out when taking the derivative with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "finally , we turn to the behavior of the density - dependent quark condensate @xmath66 in the chiral limit @xmath29 .",
    "as demonstrated in sec.iif of ref.@xcite the ( singular ) chiral logarithms @xmath80 from irreducible @xmath2-exchange and those from the @xmath21-dependent vertex corrections to the @xmath20-exchange cancel exactly in the case of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter . this subtle balance does not work anymore for pure neutron matter .",
    "the following singular piece remains : @xmath81 in order to understand the physical origin behind this infrared singularity let us consider the simplified situation with the @xmath82-wave pion - nucleon coupling set to zero : @xmath83 . in that case only the @xmath2-exchange interaction generated by the weinberg - tomozawa term ( at second order ) survives .",
    "it gives rise to an isovector ( @xmath84 ) central nn - interaction with @xmath37-derivative equal to : @xmath85 the two - body hartree term ( left diagram in fig.5 ) in infinite neutron matter is proportional to its value at zero momentum transfer @xmath86 , thus exhibiting the chiral logarithm , @xmath87 . on",
    "the other hand the limit @xmath4 of eq.(10 ) exists and it is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , the two - body fock term ( right diagram in fig.5 ) , involving the integral : @xmath89= 4k_n^6[5 - 4\\ln(2k_n/\\lambda)]/3 $ ] , stays finite in the chiral limit .",
    "the coordinate - space `` potential '' associated with the logarithm @xmath90 in momentum space actually behaves as @xmath91 ( for @xmath92 ) .",
    "its long - range character causes the interaction energy density for a homogeneous neutron - sphere of radius @xmath93 to grow logarithmically with the system size :          in other words , the usual the thermodynamic limit @xmath95 , with @xmath96constant , does not exist for such a long - ranged interaction . in this context",
    "the quantity @xmath97 plays the role of an isovector `` polarizability '' for the coupling and exchange of a pair of massless pions which causes the infrared singular behavior .",
    "since the expectation value of @xmath98 does not vanish whenever the nuclear medium is asymmetric in isospin , the corresponding in - medium quark condensate will encounter an infrared singularity in the chiral limit @xmath4 .",
    "in passing we note that the result for the quark condensate in pure proton matter ( ignoring the coulomb interaction ) is the same as that for pure neutron matter , shown in figs.1,3 .",
    "our results for the in - medium chiral condensate can also be interpreted in terms of a density - dependent effective nucleon sigma - term , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 the relative isospin - asymmetry .",
    "its isoscalar piece @xmath101 drops from the value @xmath102mev in vacuum to about @xmath103mev at @xmath104@xmath18 ( see fig.7 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the isovector piece @xmath105 , which is maximally active in pure neutron or proton matter , brings it then back to almost the vacuum value in the density region @xmath106@xmath18 considered here . as a consequence ,",
    "the nuclear scalar mean - field associated in certain models @xcite with the in - medium condensate @xmath107 , would have an attractive isoscalar component as well as an attractive isovector component with approximately opposite density dependence .    in summary ,",
    "we have used in - medium chiral perturbation theory to calculate the density - dependent quark condensate @xmath66 in pure neutron matter .",
    "we have found that the same @xmath2-exchange dynamics which stabilizes the chiral condensate in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter @xcite does not alter ( in a significant way ) its linear decrease with the neutron density @xmath69 .",
    "this different behavior originates from the reduced weight factors of the @xmath2-exchange mechanisms in pure neutron matter .",
    "we can conclude that the tendencies for chiral symmetry restoration are actually favored in systems with large neutron excess ( e.g. neutron stars ) .",
    "possible observable consequences of this feature should be further investigated .",
