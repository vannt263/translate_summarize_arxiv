    "inflation  @xcite is extremely successful paradigm for creating seed perturbations for the large scale structure in the universe  @xcite .",
    "one of the post - inflationary challenges is to recreate the universe we live in - filled with the standard model degrees of freedom and the dark matter particles  @xcite .",
    "the energy extraction from inflaton energy density to matter degrees of freedom is non - trivial , and it all depends on the couplings , i.e how inflaton couples to other matter degrees of freedom , for a review , see  @xcite .",
    "similar to the inflaton , there could be many light moduli fields present in the early universe , whose potentials are absolutely flat .",
    "the moduli fields are natural consequence of any low energy string theory , which appear in @xmath5 dimensions with almost flat potential  @xcite . in any supersymmetric theory",
    "there would be flat directions , which are built upon @xmath6 and @xmath7 flatness condition , see  @xcite .",
    "typically , the moduli could be made heavy by stringy non - perturbative effects  @xcite , but still there could be one light moduli with a mass around the scale of low supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking . if the low scale susy breaking is at @xmath8 , then the moduli would typically take a mass of that order .",
    "light moduli could be displaced during inflation by virtue of quantum fluctuations of order the hubble expansion rate during inflation , see  @xcite .",
    "in which case , the moduli lighter than the hubble expansion rate during inflation could be settled with a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , i.e. of the order of @xmath9  gev .",
    "the moduli behaves like a condensate  @xcite , and begins its coherent oscillations when the hubble expansion rate of the universe drops to the mass of the moduli  .",
    "it has been recognised , sometime ago , that the energy transfer from the inflaton / moduli field to its decay products need not be perturbative .",
    "the perturbative decay is typically slow , and the time scale is determined by the total decay width of the inflaton / moduli . on the other hand , there is an interesting possibility of draining the energy density of inflaton / moduli via non - perturbative effects in a time dependent background - known as preheating  @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the particle production during preheating is indeed non - adiabatic , the effective time dependent frequency does not evolve adiabatically .",
    "the violation of adiabaticity condition is the key for particle creation  @xcite .",
    "another important non - perturbative production mechanism , dubbed as tachyonic preheating , takes place when the time dependent frequency becomes imaginary which happens for instance when symmetry is broken spontaneously  @xcite , or when the trilinear coupling comes to dominate the interaction with the inflaton / moduli  @xcite .",
    "the process of particle creation , soon becomes non - linear due to the mode - mode interactions , which makes the problem soon intractable .",
    "the epoch of preheating , or explosive particle production stops when the back reaction is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , during the first few oscillations , as long as the energy density in the decayed quanta is still below the energy density stored in the inflaton / moduli sector , we can trust the analytical treatment , see for instance  @xcite .    during preheating one can excite scalars  @xcite , fermions  @xcite , higher spins  @xcite and gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "preheating can also generate isocurvature perturbations  @xcite , and non - gaussian signatures  @xcite .",
    "one can also excite fairly long - lived dark matter particles  @xcite . in fact , the large abundance of dark matter particle created at the time of preheating is the real threat for cosmology .    in this paper",
    "we are keen to understand the cosmological consequences of inflaton or moduli interaction via _ derivative _ couplings . for simplicity we will not distinguish between inflaton or moduli field",
    ", we will call the field to be a generic _ scalar condensate _ without loss of generality , which _ oscillates _ coherently when the scalar condensate mass becomes equal to that of the hubble expansion rate .",
    "one such example of derivative interaction is demonstrated by _ axion - like _ particles ( alps ) defined here as @xmath10 , for a review , see  @xcite .",
    "the alp appears due to the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath0 symmetry . at low energies below the symmetry breaking scale ,",
    "a nambu - goldstone boson arises as massless excitations of the angular part of the complex scalar field , which is an absolute gauge singlet .",
    "the alps can couple to the scalar field via dimensional @xmath11 and higher dimensional operators .",
    "the operators are suppressed by the axion decay constant , @xmath12 , in @xmath5 dimensions",
    ". typically @xmath1 could be large close to the gut scale or the string scale , or even the planck scale .",
    "we will keep @xmath1 as a free parameter .",
    "typically , the axion such as in the case of qcd receives its mass from instanton  @xcite , in the string theory context the anomalous @xmath0 gets broken non - perturbatively by the world - sheet instantons , and its mass could be large or small depending on the action of the instanton  @xcite .",
    "alps can act as a perfect dark matter candidate , due to its weak interaction with baryonic matter field  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", axion produced from the decay of a scalar condensate can give rise to a non - thermal distribution of dark matter and dark radiation , depending on the mass of alps .",
    "of course , one has to make sure that alps are produced perturbatively / non - perturbatively to match the current observations from the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite , and the current planck data on dark matter and dark radiation abundance  @xcite  .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that : + _ the alps can be produced abundantly from the coherent oscillations of a scalar condensate for a wide range of masses , i.e. heavy or light alps , as long as @xmath13 , where @xmath3 denotes the initial amplitude of the coherent oscillations of a scalar condensate , i.e. inflaton / moduli . _",
    "+ for the purpose of illustration , we will fix the initial value of the amplitude of the oscillations of the scalar condensate to be @xmath14 , without loss of generality .",
    "what matters here is the ratio : @xmath15 .",
    "the rate at which the particle production will take place would be sensitive to this value , as we shall demonstrate in this paper .",
    "the results of this paper will have an important consequence for string theory motivated alps  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows - in section  [ sect : interactions ] , we will discuss the alp s interaction with a homogeneous scalar condensate , i.e. inflaton / moduli . in section  [ sec : dim5 ]",
    ", we study the alp scalar interaction via dimensional @xmath11 operator , and study preheating of alps without and with expansion effects .",

    "we will repeat the computation by taking into account of the expansion effect .",
    "finally , we will conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] by alluding to some of the dark matter and dark radiation bounds , whose detailed scans will be provided in a separate publication .",
    "let us consider the following lagrangian with derivative couplings of the form   @xmath21 where @xmath4 is a scalar condensate , which sets its coherent oscillations around the minimum of a quadratic potential governed by its mass @xmath22  .",
    "let us denote @xmath10 as an alp with a mass @xmath23 , which couples to the @xmath4 field with derivative interactions , and @xmath24 is the axion decay constant . here",

    "( [ eq : chikeom ] ) for various scenarios .",

    "both , @xmath40 , and the @xmath41 , can be then approximated by @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the evolution of the dynamical system for two cases : @xmath44 , and when and @xmath17 .      when @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , eq .",

    "hence , one would naively think that there can not be tachyonic instabilities , which are triggered by a negative squared frequency  @xcite .",
    "we will see later that the presence of an oscillating damping coefficient leads to tachyonic instabilities  , see for instance eqs.([eq : transform2])-([eq : ykomega2 ] ) for the dimensional 6 operator , a similar transformation holds for the dimensional 5 operator . ] .",
    "however , as we shall see now , these tachyonic instabilties do not lead to significant enhancement in @xmath53 when @xmath54 .",

    "<S> axion like particles ( alps ) are quite generic in many scenarios for physics beyond the standard model , they are pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone bosons , and appear once any global @xmath0 symmetry is broken spontaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the alps can gain mass from various non - perturbative quantum effects , such as anomalies or instantons . </S>",
    "<S> alps can couple to the matter sector incluidng a scalar condensate such as inflaton or moduli field via derivative interactions , which are suppressed by the axion _ decay constant _ , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> although weakly interacting , the alps can be produced abundantly from the coherent oscillations of a homogeneous condensate . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will study such a scenario where the alps can be produced abundantly , and in some cases can even overclose the universe via odd and even dimensional operators , as long as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the initial amplitude of the coherent oscillations of the scalar condensate , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we will briefly mention how such dangerous overproduction would affect dark matter and dark radiation abundances in the universe . </S>"
