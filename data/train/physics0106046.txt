    "stueckelberg @xcite and feynman @xcite suggested that all electrons and positrons are the same particle undergoing time reversals .",
    "classical electrodynamics ( ced ) prohibits a particle passing from a sub - luminal to superluminal speed and undergoing a time - reversal , and therefore apparently can not implement the stueckelberg - feynman conjecture .",
    "however , this prohibition applies only to charged particles possessing an intrinsic rest mass , whereas we show here that ced without the traditional inertial - mass action permits transitions from sub - luminal to superluminal speeds by the same particle .",
    "we take as a starting point here that the bare charge is free of both self - action and compensating forces .",
    "since radiation reaction is also an action of the particle s fields upon itself , it follows that the bare charge is not subject to radiation reaction , and , from energy and momentum conservation , that the secondary radiation emitted by the particle can carry no independent energy or momentum .",
    "these requirements are satisfied by the time - symmetric , direct - action without self - action form of electromagnetism that originated with schwarzschild , tetrode , and fokker in the early part of the last century @xcite .",
    "those early presentations lacked an explanation for exclusively retarded radiation and the radiation reaction on the source .",
    "subsequently dirac @xcite showed that radiation reaction arises if the advanced fields are set to zero , for which the wheeler and feynman @xcite absorber theory gave a physical justification . here",
    "however , unlike those works , the charge sources will not be ascribed an intrinsic ( now necessarily non - electromagnetic ) inertial mass , because the focus of this document is on the behavior of classical charges in their allegedly pre - mass condition .    in direct action electrodynamics , em fields ,",
    "if they are used at all , are purely mathematical devices for conveying ` interaction ' between pairs of charged particles ; there are no independent ( vacuum ) fields .",
    "a classical particle then has no self energy - though there seems to be no simple way to rid the corresponding quantized theories of divergences @xcite .",
    "we will need to revisit this issue , however , in section [ sec : self action ] .",
    "initially we will presume a state of affairs at zero kelvin wherein the advanced and retarded fields have equal status , wherein one is not cancelled and the other enhanced at the location of the particle .",
    "the viability of the direct action formulation at elevated ( non - zero ) temperatures however demands a plausible explanation for the predominance of retarded radiation .",
    "the particular implementation of direct - action em advocated by wheeler and feynman in order to explain the emergence of time - asymmetric retarded radiation is contingent on the existence of relatively cold distant absorbers of radiation on the future light cone .",
    "these absorbers provide a thermal sink , permitting radiation energy and momentum to flow away from local sources , thereby performing the role traditionally played by the vacuum degrees of freedom .",
    "the flow of radiation energy is properly accompanied by a reaction back upon the source , performing the role traditionally played by the self - fields .",
    "the time - asymmetric boundary condition ( cold absorbers on the future light cone ) also succeeds in explaining how time - asymmetric radiation arises in an intrinsically time - symmetric theory .",
    "( the equations of classical em - with or without field degrees of freedom - are of course intrinsically time - symmetric . ) in order to guarantee complete absorption on the future light cone , the absorber theory places constraints on the rate of cosmological expansion , which according to davies , @xcite , are satisfied only by the oscillating friedman cosmology - which is now out of favor .",
    "davies claims that the constraints are also satisfied by the steady - state theory which , however , has also fallen out of favor due to its failure to explain the cosmic microwave background . in his comprehensive review of the subject , pegg , @xcite ,",
    "contests davies claim that radiation in the steady - state cosmology is perfectly absorbed by future matter , citing the fall - off with increasing wavelength - and therefore red - shift - of absorbtion in a plasma",
    ". however , there may still be sufficient absorbtion in the steady - state cosmology through the action of thomson scattering , which remains independent of frequency for low frequencies , and though elastic , removes energy from the primary wave .",
    "wheeler and feynman also proposed an alternative to the theory of future absorbers wherein the future is transparent and the history is perfectly absorbing to advanced radiation emitted from the present @xcite .",
    "this possibility appears to be consistent with the open ( and flat ) friedman cosmologies , and the steady - state theory .",
    "the investigation of a massless condition of a classical charge would benefit from some indication of how the observed mass might arise classically .",
    "( the higgs mechanism , which otherwise satisfies that requirement , is excluded . )",
    "in particular we have in mind attempts to explain inertial mass in electromagnetic terms - an endeavour towards which feynman was sympathetic @xcite .",
    "it is not correct to include in such attempts the now discarded models of the classical electron by poincar @xcite and updated by schwinger @xcite because these are not solely electromagnetic ; they rely upon non - electromagnetic forces to hold the particle together . of greater relevance",
    "are recent efforts to explain inertial mass by calling upon a special role for the zpf @xcite - @xcite .",
    "an alternative suggestion , favoring a fully _ non - local _ electromagnetic origin of , specifically , electron mass , is given in section [ ref : electron mass ] .",
    "in the following we begin with the simplest possible version of classical electromagnetism : with the particle stripped of intrinsic mass , and the fields stripped of vacuum degrees of freedom radiation reaction , and time - asymmetry .",
    "we use the convention @xmath0 and heaviside - lorentz units with @xmath1 except for the explicit calculation in section [ sec : motion near a charge with magnetic dipole moment ] .    the contribution to the action from a single massless charge , assuming the fields are given , is just @xmath2 where we have used that the 4-current due to a single charge is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is any ordinal parameterization of the trajectory , and where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are 4-vectors . from its definition , the current is divergenceless for as long as the trajectory has no visible end - points . in the event",

    "( [ interaction ] ) must be that of other sources , which therefore can be written @xmath8 where the bar over the @xmath7 signifies that the potential is formed from contributions from all sources except the @xmath9 source ; where @xmath10 is the time - symmetric green s function for the wave equation ; and the @xmath11 represents convolution@xmath12 where @xmath13 .",

    "( [ interaction ] ) for just one degree of freedom , is therefore @xmath14 equivalent to the supposition that the potential from the other sources , @xmath15 , is given , is that the fields are in no way correlated with the motion of the single source responsible for the current @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) . therefore",
    "this investigation may be regarded as an analysis of the state of affairs pertaining to the first of an infinite sequence of iterations of the interaction between the @xmath9 current and the distant @xmath15 currents responsible for the fields .    with the fields given , the euler equation for the ( massless ) lone particle degree of freedom in eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) is simply that the lorentz force on the particle in question must vanish:@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the em field - strength tensor , wherein the fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 are to be evaluated along the trajectory . in 3 + 1",

    "it is consistent with the condition that the lorentz force on the particle must vanish - recognized as the constraint on the fields such that there exist a frame in which the electric field is zero . in an environment of arbitrary field variation , eq .",

    "it is not known if eq .",
    "( [ e.b=0 ] ) permits multiple , unconnected , closed surfaces , connoting localization of the particle .    since eq .",

    "let us suppose for now that the trajectory is sparse , so that @xmath39 defined in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) can not be a 4-vector field , because it is not defined off the trajectory . then one would like to parameterize the trajectory in a lorentz invariant way , so that @xmath55 along the trajectory is a ( lorentz ) 4-vector .",
    "this requires that the norm @xmath56 is a constant scalar ( i.e. a 4-scalar , as opposed to a relativistic scalar field ) where @xmath57 then it is clear from eq .",

    "the trajectory is now divided up into a sequence of sub - luminal and superluminal segments , which designation is lorentz invariant , and for which the norm is @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively ( the segment boundary points and the sub - luminal and superluminal labels are lorentz invariant because the three conditions @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 are lorentz invariants . ) hence , in each segment @xmath39 is now a true lorentz 4-vector .      in the limit that the trajectory is sufficiently dense in space",
    ", it will no longer be possible to identify individual trajectories , and one must go over to a continuum description",
    ". then it seems reasonable to assume that at every @xmath71 location ( really a small 4-volume centered on that location ) observation implies an interaction with the accumulated sum of visits by the trajectory to that location . in that case one",
    "should define a lorentz vector _",
    "@xmath72 say , @xmath73 however , since the trajectory must lie on the surface eq .  ( [ e.b=0 ] ) it can",

    "the best it can do is fill that surface , in which case @xmath74 is defined only on that surface , and is otherwise zero .",
    "since the trajectory is ` conserved ' it follows that the 4-divergence of its accumulation vanishes : @xmath75 i.e. @xmath72 is a 4-current , in agreement with the identification made by stuckelberg @xcite .",

    "there is some overlap here with the theory of tachyons , and much of the following may be inferred from the ` reinterpretation principle ' of tachyon theory @xcite .",
    "however , it is to be stressed that we are dealing with a single ` particle ' that is intrinsically massless , whereas the study of tachyons is generally concerned with particles that have intrinsic ` transcendental momentum ' - the tachyon counterpart to the intrinsic mass of bradyonic ( @xmath79 ) matter . as a consequence ,",
    "traditionally the energy for both bradyons and tachyons becomes singular as light speed is approached from either side .",
    "light - speed therefore constitutes a barrier , making the labels bradyon and tachyon permanent attributes of these particles - unlike the massless particle that is the focus of this document .    with reference to fig .  1 wherein a time reversal occurs at point q , the segments pq and qr have different signs for @xmath80 .",
    "however , which sign is attributed to which segment ( the direction of the arrow in the figure ) is not decided by eq .  ( [ v ito e and b ] ) . instead",
    ", the sense of the trajectory must be instantiated at some point ` by hand ' . noticing that eqs .",
    "( [ f(x , lambda ) ] ) and ( [ f ito w ] ) give @xmath81 it is clear that @xmath82 is the degree of freedom that permits one to choose the sign of just one segment , the sign of all other segments on that trajectory being decided thereafter .",
    "if there is only one trajectory then the sign of @xmath83 is a common factor for the whole action , so this choice will amount to no more than a convention without any physical consequences unless some ( additional ) absolute sense specificity is introduced into the dynamics .",
    "but if there are multiple , unconnected , trajectories , then clearly their relative senses will be important .    for given fields at a fixed space - time location @xmath84 , the change @xmath85 in the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) is equivalent to @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "consistent with cpt invariance therefore , @xmath83 can be interpreted as the sign of the charge at some fixed point on the trajectory . in accord with the conjecture of stueckelberg and feynman , the alternating segments of positive and negative signs ( of @xmath88 ) along the trajectory",
    "can then be regarded as denoting electrons and positrons respectively . from the perspective of uniformly increasing laboratory time @xmath53 , the electrons and positrons",
    "are created and destroyed in pairs , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "note that charge is conserved in @xmath53 just because these events occur in ( oppositely charged ) pairs as entry and exit paths to and from the turning points .",

    "likewise , segments with @xmath89 remain sub - luminal when viewed from any ( sub - luminally ) boosted frame . that is , as mentioned above , the labels @xmath89 and @xmath70 are lorentz invariant .",
    "note though that the invariant status of these labels is a consequence of the restriction of the boost transformations to sub - luminal velocities .",

    "the labels @xmath89 and @xmath70 cease to be immutable aspects of the trajectory .",
    "the points @xmath92 , however , remain immutable .",
    "the sign of the direction in time of a sub - luminal segment can not be changed by applying a ( sub - luminal ) boost transformation and therefore the sign of the charge is a lorentz invariant . however , with reference to the labelling exterior to the circle in fig .  2 ( wherein the direction in time is always positive ) , a superluminally - moving charge _",

    "the hypersurface @xmath96 is a lorentz - invariant collection of events arising here from the requirement that the determinant of @xmath18 vanish .",
    "one might ask of the other lorentz invariant associated with the field strengths , @xmath97 , and why not the hypersurface @xmath98 instead ? it can be inferred from the fact that the latter quantity is the determinant of @xmath41 that the source of the broken symmetry lies in the fact of the existence of the electric charge but not magnetic charge ; the trajectory of a magnetic charge , were it to exist , would be constrained to lie on the hypersurface @xmath98 .",
    "whilst following the instructions of the em field , the particle generates its own advanced and retarded secondary fields as a result of its motion as determined by the usual em formulae . by taking the scalar product of eq .",

    "so that the motion is defined , both @xmath19 and @xmath20 must be non - zero , or else it must be assumed that one or both must default to some noise value .",
    "one might then ask if the space part of the proper acceleration is correlated with the lorentz force , i.e. whether@xmath102 is non - zero .",
    "but it is recalled that the massless particle executes a path upon which the lorentz force is always zero .",

    "( trump and shieve @xcite claim that the original proof is logically circular . ) in any case , it is doubtful that the theorem can be applied to the massless electrodynamics described here : the theorem applies specifically to direct action classical electrodynamics written in terms of a single time variable , which , if time - reversals are permitted , seems unlikely to be generally feasible .",

    "indeed , its motion is precisely that which causes it to feel no force , eq .",

    "its motion is nonetheless uniquely prescribed by the ( here misleadingly termed ) ` force - fields ' @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these fields still decide the particle trajectory ( given some initial condition ) , just as the lorentz force determines the motion of a massive particle ( again , given some initial condition ) .",

    "instead , each particle sees a different field at the same location . as a result of the conclusion of section [ sec : self action ] , however , this state of affairs may be subject to revision .    assuming it has any connection to real physics",
    ", the massless particle discussed here can not be a classical relative of the neutrino . and it does not seem to be a traditional classical object in need of quantization .",
    "given the fact of the charge , plus the suggestively qm - type behavior described above , and taking into account the non - locality conferred by super - luminal speeds , it seems more appropriate to investigate the possibility that the object under consideration is a primitive relative - in a pre - mass and perhaps pre - classical and pre - quantum - mechanical condition - of the electron .",
    "one can not expect convergence with qm or qft for as long as the intrinsically massless electron has not somehow acquired mass .",
    "though a detailed explanation will not be attempted here , it is observed that one of the dirac large number coincidences may be interpreted in a manner suggestive of a role for advanced and retarded fields in the establishing electron mass .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the coincidence @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the hubble radius , may be a universal self - consistency condition maintained by em zpf fields .",
    "though this may be conceivable in a static universe , it can not be true in our expanding universe because the mean path length of a photon of ( retarded ) radiation is of the order of the hubble radius .",
    "self - consistency may be possible , however , if both retarded and advanced fields are employed , as is the case in this document . then it is conceivable that the calculations in @xcite will retain their validity in realistic cosmologies , about which it is hoped to say more elsewhere .",
    "very briefly , the suggestion is that the electron mass may be the result of constructive interference of time - symmetric fields reflecting - elastically - off distant sources at zero kelvin .",
    "the idea may be regarded as an extension of the absorber theory of wheeler and feynman , the latter describing the elevated temperature behavior of the same scatterers , which might then serve both as the explanation for the origin of inertial mass and the the predominance of retarded radiation .      in section [ sec : action and the euler equation ]",
    "the choice was made to deal with infinite self energy by excluding self action by fiat and adopting the direct action version of em .",
    "the distribution of particle labels in eqs .",
    "( [ total potential]-[total interaction ] ) enforces exclusion of the ` self - self ' terms that connote self - interaction . however , a finding of this investigation is that a massless particle in a given em field obeying eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) can travel at both sub - luminal and superluminal speeds , which behavior undermines the labelling scheme . to see this , with reference to the left - hand diagram in fig .  4 ,",
    "if the particle never achieves light speed , then clearly it will never cross any light cone emanating from any point on that trajectory .",
    "that is , the particle will never see its own light cone . similarly for a particle that is always superluminal .",
    "but with reference to the right - hand diagram in fig .  4 , a trajectory with both sub - luminal and superluminal segments necessarily intersects its own light cone .",
    "if the whole trajectory is deemed to be non - self - interacting , in accordance with the fiat of no self action , then these points of electromagnetic contact can not contribute to the action .",
    "yet these points of interaction are similar in character to the ` genuine ' - and therefore admitted - points of contact between any two different trajectories ( if indeed there are multiple , distinguishable trajectories , each with their own starting points and end points ) .",
    "the problem is that the ` no self action ' rule , necessary for masslessness of the bare charge , now impacts points of contact that are quite different to the infinitesimally local self action , i.e. @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( [ single potential ] ) , that was the original target of the rule . in order that these distant points on the same trajectory conform to the fiat and",
    "be excluded from self action it must be supposed that the trajectory , even after any number of time reversals , forever distinguish itself from other trajectories across all space - time , which requires that each trajectory carry a unique label ( quite apart from its charge and state of motion ) .",
    "in addition to its intrinsic ugliness , this strategy is unappealing because it precludes the possibility that all electrons and positrons can be described by just one trajectory .    in order to save the masslessness",
    "conjecture the alternative must be considered that electromagnetic contact is permitted between distant points on the _ same _ trajectory , whilst the energy associated with contact at infinitesimally local points - the coulomb self - energy in the rest frame of the particle - is somehow rendered finite .",
    "but then it would seem that we are back with the infinite self - energy problem we set out to avoid by assuming directly - coupled massless sources without self - action , i.e. , back to the problem of finite structures ( that are not observed ) , and poincar stresses ( that connote new non - electromagnetic forces ) which have had to be abandoned - for recent examples see @xcite and @xcite . as observed by pegg @xcite , despite the contention in @xcite , feynman subsequently decided that it was unlikely that a successful theory could be constructed without having electrons act upon themselves @xcite . in support of this conclusion , feynman cites the contribution to a total scattering amplitude from a process in the vicinity of an existing electron in which an electron - positron pair is created , the latter then annihilating the original electron , leaving only the new electron surviving . in qed , such a process occurring in the close vicinity of an electron can be regarded as due to self - action .",
    "but it can not be excluded from the physics , because the same process is necessary for a description of events involving discrete particles initially separated by large distances in space . in @xcite davies",
    "comes to a similar conclusion about the inevitability of self - action .    here",
    ", distinct from those works , at least in so far as they address ced , is the novel input of superluminal motion - a consequence of the presumed masslessness of the bare charge .",
    "superluminal motion permits the possibility of singular self - interaction between _ distant _",
    "( i.e. not ` infinitesimally - local ' ) points on the same trajectory , leading in turn to the possibility that the coulomb energy may be offset by singular self - attraction between different points on the same trajectory .",
    "initial efforts in this direction , @xcite , though incomplete , are promising . if that approach is successful , an outcome will be that the distinguishing labels in eq .  ( [ total interaction ] ) will become unnecessary , and it becomes possible to represent the _ total _ current by @xmath152 wherein all electrons and positrons are now segments of a single , closed , time - reversing trajectory .",
    "we have investigated the accommodation of massless charges within the direct - action without self - action form of classical electromagnetism .",
    "the charges move so as to feel no lorentz force , which , for given external fields , constrains their location at all times to the surface @xmath96 .",
    "these two conditions determine the equation of motion for the particle , given by eqs .",
    "( [ w ] ) and  ( [ w defn ] ) . that equation permits sub - liminal and superluminal speeds , time - reversals , and crossing of the light - speed ` barrier ' , connoting non - locality and pair creation and destruction .",
    "an interesting solution has been given for a one - body problem .",
    "it was argued that for there to be correspondence with the physics of real electrons , perhaps at a pre - quantum - mechanical level , inertial mass must originate from external electromagnetic interaction . in agreement with feynman s later comments",
    ", it was shown that the self - action can not be excluded by fiat after all .",
    "it was concluded that for the charge to retain its intrinsic masslessness some additional remedy is required so as to render the coulomb part of the self - action finite , in which , perhaps , superluminal motion could turn out to be an essential novel ingredient .",
    "the author is very happy to acknowledge the important role of stimulating and enjoyable discussions with h. e. puthoff , s. r. little , and a. rueda ."
