    "in 1903 , henry dudeney , a popular creator of mathematical puzzles , posed the famous spider and fly problem in @xcite : given a spider and fly in a @xmath6 foot room , the spider on one @xmath7 wall , one foot below the ceiling and equidistant from the sides , and the fly on the other @xmath7 wall , one foot above the floor and equidistant from the sides - what is the shortest path the spider can take to reach the fly by crawling along the walls , floor , and ceiling of the room ?",
    "the most obvious path , going straight up , then straight across the ceiling , then straight down to the fly , is 42 feet long .",
    "the spider s optimal path of @xmath8 feet requires it traverse five faces of the room before reaching the spider .",
    "we can cut along certain edges of the room , flatten out the room and then this path is a straight line segment .",
    "the problem can be generalized to an arbitrary point on an arbitrarily sized rectangular box . by scaling and rotating",
    ", we can restrict the dimensions of the box to @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the spider to be a point on the @xmath1 face .",
    "we wish to find the shortest distance along the surface of the box ( the path is called a geodesic ) between this point and its opposite - the point obtained by reflecting the original point across the center of the box ( this is the antipodal map )",
    ".    we can assign @xmath12-coordinates to the points of the @xmath1 side so it is described by @xmath13 and @xmath14 . by symmetry",
    ", it suffices to solve the problem for points in the fundamental region @xmath15 given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "dudeney s spider has @xmath18 . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* - 146 ) , ransom made progress on this question for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in this article",
    ", we attempt to solve the generalized problem . one might think this has an easy , elegant solution ; let us surprise you with how baroque the details actually become .",
    "there is a question of what form the solution should take .",
    "the solution we found most compelling is the following : for each point @xmath5 in the @xmath21-plank ( @xmath22 ) and each point in the associated @xmath15 , we will describe six paths , at least one of which must be the shortest .",
    "we note that sometimes , for each of two nearby points @xmath5 , the subsets of the fundamental region , on which each of the six distance functions is smallest , `` look essentially the same '' .",
    "this is a topological notion ; so we use topology to describe an equivalence relation .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the fundamental regions associated to the points @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the @xmath21-plank .",
    "we consider @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be in the same equivalence class if we can continuously deform the boundary curves ( between regions on which a given distance function is smallest ) and edges of @xmath23 to the boundary curves and edges of @xmath24 such that the shortest of the six paths associated to the points bounded by these curves remain the same ( this will be defined precisely in section  [ equrel ] using homeomorphisms ) .",
    "we will describe all 47 of the equivalence classes and the associated @xmath15 s .",
    "the computational proofs of the validity of the equivalence classes are quite long and are presented in appendix .",
    "we consider the @xmath1 face to be the top face of the box , the face opposite it to be the bottom face of the box and the four other faces to be side faces .",
    "as we look down on the box , we orient the @xmath1 face as we standardly orient the @xmath27-plane . if the path ( starting in @xmath15 ) leaves the @xmath1 face and then enters the side face to the right , up above , left or down below then we denote the path @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , respectively ( with j to be defined next ) . if the path continues immediately to the bottom face , then we let j = 0 .",
    "this path crosses three faces .",
    "if , after entering the first side face , the path continues in a clockwise direction ( viewed from above ) and crosses a total of @xmath32 side faces beforing entering the bottom face , then we let @xmath33 .",
    "this path crosses @xmath34 faces .",
    "if , after entering the first side face , the path continues in a counterclockwise direction and crosses a total of @xmath32 side faces beforing entering the bottom face , then we let @xmath35 .    in figure",
    "[ flat ] , the six rectangles with all solid edges give one flattening of the box .",
    "other rectangles are faces for other flattenings on which certain paths are line segments . the figure indicates paths @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the fundamental region is shown in the center of the figure ; its reflections by the antipodal map are indicated near the boundary .        paths with @xmath40 can not be shortest .",
    "first assume @xmath41 .",
    "we will prove this by contradiction .",
    "assume , for some @xmath42 and some @xmath43 , that @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 and @xmath46 cross the same initial side faces and same final side faces .",
    "consider a new path that is identical to @xmath45 on the top and bottom faces .",
    "along the two side faces that @xmath46 crosses , complete the new path by connecting the points where @xmath45 meets the edges of the top and bottom faces with the shortest possible path ( it will be a line segment when those two side faces are flattened ) .",
    "note that the length of the new path is at least @xmath47 , since it crosses the same faces as @xmath46 .",
    "the path @xmath45 and the new path are identical except on the sides faces . on flattened side faces , @xmath45 and the new path are each the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one side of length @xmath4 ( the height of each side face ) . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the other side of the right triangle has length greater than @xmath48 , which is the width of the second and third of the four side faces it crosses . on the new path , the other side of the right triangle has length less than @xmath48 , which is the width of the two side faces it crosses .",
    "so the new path has length less than @xmath49 and at least @xmath47 ; this is a contradiction . for the argument for @xmath50 , just flip the signs in the subscripts .",
    "the cases where @xmath51 , where paths cross at least five side faces , are obvious .",
    "note that if we started at the point @xmath52 and traveled along the edge not bordering @xmath15 , or had a path that eventually traveled along this edge or any edge parallel to it , then this would be a degenerate form of more than one of the paths given and thus would be considered in our analysis .    by cutting along edges ,",
    "the 3 , 4 or 5 faces that a path crosses can be flattened out onto a plane , which is the easiest way to determine the length of the corresponding paths .",
    "note that a line segment path from one point to its opposite can leave and reenter a flattening .",
    "we do not need to worry about this case because it leaves and reenters on what is the same edge of the box . by gluing those edges back together and possibly perturbing the path",
    ", we get a different and shorter path .",
    "the referee pointed out that the map that reflects points across the origin ( the antipodal map ) interchanges pairs of paths .",
    "the pairs are @xmath53 ( for each @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ flat ] for @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "the length of each path in a pair is the same .",
    "so to minimize distance , it suffices to consider one path in each pair .",
    "we choose @xmath61 , @xmath37 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath36 , and @xmath65 . in table",
    "[ 10distances ] , for a point @xmath66 , we give the coordinates of the opposite point , given the obvious flattening for each of the 10 paths ( this is illustrated in figure  [ flat ] for four of the paths ) , and @xmath67 , the square of the distance between them . in the table we let @xmath68 .",
    ".the 10 distance functions ( note @xmath68 ) [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we describe the most interesting proof technique we used ( in sections  [ blessthan1 ] and [ bbiggerthan1 ] ) to determine the equivalence classes and associated labeled @xmath15 s .",
    "let @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 be three distinct distance functions from the six of concern . if , for a given @xmath5 , we have @xmath66 such that @xmath72 then we call @xmath12 a _ triple intersection _ for @xmath73 .    it will sometimes help to know , for a given three distance functions , that there is no triple intersection in the interior of @xmath15 .",
    "let us start with a geometric example of what we call a spontaneous generation of a triple intersection .",
    "then we give a rigorous definition and a description of how to find them . as an example , let @xmath73 denote three distinct distance functions",
    ". assume for all @xmath5 in some open subset @xmath74 of the @xmath21-plank , that @xmath75 is a single arc , concave up , with lowest point @xmath76 ( with @xmath77 and @xmath78 depending on @xmath5 ) ; @xmath69 is smaller above the arc and @xmath70 below .",
    "assume for all @xmath5 in @xmath74 , that @xmath79 is a single arc , concave down , with highest point @xmath80 ( with @xmath81 and @xmath82 depending on @xmath5 ) ; @xmath70 is smaller above the arc and @xmath71 below .",
    "assume that there is a path in @xmath74 from @xmath83 to @xmath84 ( distinct points ) and on all points of the path except @xmath83 we have @xmath85 and at @xmath83 we have @xmath86 .",
    "then at @xmath83 we have the spontaneous generation of a triple intersection for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 at @xmath76 .",
    "note that if we consider only @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , then the labeled @xmath15 at @xmath83 is not equivalent to those for other points on the path .",
    "now we give a rigorous definition .",

    "then we define @xmath90 to be a _ spontaneous generation _ of a triple intersection for @xmath73 .    to find the set of @xmath5 s at which they occur",
    ", we can take the resultant of @xmath91 and @xmath92 with respect to @xmath93 .",
    "this defines a surface ( with possibly more than one component ) in @xmath94-space .",
    "we then take the projection of this surface onto the @xmath21-plank .",
    "if @xmath90 is a spontaneous generation , then the projection of @xmath95 on the @xmath21-plank will be on the boundary of the projection of a neighborhood of @xmath95 in the surface . at such a point @xmath95 , a normal vector to the surface will be parallel to the @xmath21-plank .",
    "so we can find conditions on @xmath3 and @xmath4 for such points by taking the resultant , with respect to @xmath96 , of a polynomial defining the surface , with its partial derivative with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "the following theorem will be used in two of the proofs in section  [ bbiggerthan1 ] determining the equivalence classes .",
    "[ spontaneous ] for the triples @xmath97 and @xmath98 there is no spontaneous generation of a triple intersection .    for @xmath97 the points obtained at which a spontaneous generation of a triple intersection could occur are on @xmath99 , which does not pass through the @xmath21-plank . for @xmath98 , after using a resultant to remove @xmath93 we get @xmath100 .",
    "we then take the resultant , with respect to @xmath96 , of @xmath101 with its partial derivative with respect to @xmath96 to get @xmath102 .",
    "but @xmath103 does not pass through the @xmath21-plank .",
    "for each subset of the @xmath21-plank described in table  [ 47ec ] , we need only consider the distance functions listed in table  [ naive ] .",
    "then , in the proofs in sections  [ blessthan1 ] and [ bbiggerthan1 ] , we show that changes in equivalence class can only occur along certain curves in the @xmath21-plank .",
    "nine of these equivalence class borders come from the @xmath21-curves associated to the occurrences described in lemma  [ disdifisoclacha ] .",
    "five of these borders are where three distance functions have a triple intersection on one of the four sides of @xmath15 .",

    ", we also show that the labeled @xmath15 , for each @xmath5 in the given subset , is homeomorphic ( with the three properties described in the definition of the equivalence relation in section  [ equrel ] of this article ) to the one in figure  [ thefs1 ] or [ thefs2 ] . as there is no such homeomorphism between any distinct pair of labeled @xmath15 s in figure  [ thefs1 ] and [ thefs2 ]",
