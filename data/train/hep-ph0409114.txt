    "the behavior of qcd at finite temperature is of great theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "traditionally , finite temperature calculations of a field theory are performed in euclidean space with periodic boundary conditions imposed in the time direction .",
    "however , the same information can be extracted from a minkowski space calculation by examining the density of states in the spectrum as a function of energy . in particular , an exponentially increasing density of states",
    "implies a finite critical temperature @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "there is some experimental evidence of this exponential increase in the hadron spectrum @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been renewed interest in the lightcone formulation of thermal field theory in minkowski space @xcite . in this letter",
    "we investigate the aspects of a lightcone formulation of qcd relevant for finite temperature and , in particular , its implications for the string picture of qcd .    to leading order of the @xmath2 expansion of qcd @xcite , we compute the density of glueball states per unit mass via the transverse lattice approach to non - abelian gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "this is a hamiltonian method that combines light - front quantization in the two `` longitudinal '' spacetime directions , @xmath3 , with a lattice in the remaining `` transverse '' directions , @xmath4 .",
    "it has been successfully used to compute the properties of the lightest glueballs and mesons ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in these calculations ,",
    "effective hamiltonians on coarse lattices were tuned to optimize lorentz covariance of the lightest boundstates .",
    "the method also yields the spectrum of heavier boundstates .",
    "a rapid exponential rise in the density of states suggests that there may be enough states at relatively low masses , where the coarse lattice calculation is still accurate for aggregate quantities , to observe this behaviour unambiguously .",
    "using the detailed methods described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrate that in an intermediate mass range , @xmath5 times the lightest glueball mass , the density of states does indeed show a degree of universality with respect to cutoffs .",
    "we find an exponentially increasing density of states , implying a finite - temperature hagedorn transition .",
    "although the method is not well - suited to producing an accurate prediction of the critical temperature , we make a numerical estimate and produce analytic bounds on it .",
    "one application of interest is to the string picture of large-@xmath6 gauge theory .",
    "results from previous euclidean lattice computations @xcite indicate a @xmath1 lower than that of the nambu - goto string model @xcite , suggesting that a qcd string in the large-@xmath6 limit has more worldsheet degrees of freedom than this free bosonic string .",
    "our calculations suggest that this is due at least in part to longitudinal oscillations .",
    "this is also consistent with the nambu - goto string description appearing in a distinct , unstable phase of transverse lattice gauge theory discovered by klebanov and susskind @xcite .",
    "the transverse lattice is formulated in the following manner .",
    "two coordinates @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are continuous while two directions @xmath9 are discretized as a lattice , spacing @xmath10 .",
    "the longitudinal continuum gauge potentials @xmath11 lie at sites @xmath12 .",
    "the transverse flux link fields @xmath13 , @xmath14 , lie on the link between @xmath12 and @xmath15 , representing the gauge fields polarized in the @xmath12 directions . in general",
    "there are also fermi fields @xmath16 , but we will not need these for the glueball spectrum at large-@xmath6 . for a coarse transverse lattice ,",
    "the strategy is to perform a color - dieletric expansion @xcite of the most general lightcone gauge hamiltonian , renormalisable with respect to the continuum coordinates @xmath7 , in powers of @xmath17 . provided these link fields are chosen sufficiently heavy , one can truncate this expansion to study the low lying hadron boundstates dominated by just a few particles of these fields .",
    "the remaining couplings in the effective hamiltonian can then be accurately constrained by optimizing symmetries broken by the cutoffs in low energy observables .",
    "typically this method is viable in a window between small lattice spacings , where the fields become too light to justify the color - dieletric expansion , and large lattice spacings where lorentz covariance breaks down uncontrollably .    for completeness",

    "( [ ferlag ] ) .",
    "these couplings are accurately constrained by optimizing covariance of low - lying glueball eigenfunctions and rotational invariance of the heavy - source potential .",
    "the relatively large number of couplings means the hamiltonian is highly ` improved ' and can give cut - off independent results on quite coarse lattices . taking the fundamental scale to be the string tension @xmath25 , refs .",
    "@xcite investigated individual glueball masses up to about 1.5 times the lightest glueball mass and the method was shown to produce accurate results , even for lattice spacings of order @xmath26 .",
    "we investigate here whether any part of the higher excited spectrum , probed at finite temperature , is similarly under control .",
    "@xmath27 + @xmath28    @xmath27 + @xmath28",
    "we employ a dlcq cutoff @xmath29 in the @xmath30 direction @xcite to obtain a finite fock space basis at finite transverse lattice spacing @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we must study the stability of results under variation of both @xmath29 and @xmath10 . figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] display the distribution of glueball masses @xmath31 , in units of the string tension @xmath32 , for the @xmath33 state in the spectrum .",
    "the results in fig.[fig1 ] are shown for fixed @xmath34 , the lattice spacing at which the best covariance of the low - lying spectrum was obtained for lagrangian ( [ ferlag ] ) , and increasing values of the dlcq cutoff @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the limit of infinite dimensional fock space .",
    "the largest basis at @xmath37 contains 654,948 states in total , though only the lowest 20,000 are plotted for file storage reasons . at the largest masses displayed , the dlcq cutoff is introducing non - universal artifacts because it cuts off the maximum number of @xmath38-particles in a state . at lower masses",
    "however , there is universal behavior of the slope of the distribution .",
    "we repeated the calculation for @xmath37 at four different lattice spacings , shown in fig.[fig2 ] , the couplings of ( [ ferlag ] ) re - optimized for covariance of the low - lying spectrum at each . again , for the range of masses plotted , the slope is relatively universal .",
    "the approximately universal linear growth observed in this region implies that the density of states per unit mass , @xmath39 , grows exponentially with mass @xmath38 @xmath40 this exponential behaviour establishes itself already in the first 100 or so states , occuring at less than twice the lightest glueball mass , which is within the expected range of validity of the method @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps surprising from the figures that the universal growth appears to extend to much higher masses .",
    "one would expect the individual highly excited glueball masses to shift around relative to their true values due to cutoff dependence . however , an aggregate quantity like the density of states appears to be less sensitive to cutoff dependence .",
    "it is well known @xcite that exponential growth of the density of states leads to a diverging canonical partition function for temperature @xmath41 . to determine an accurate value for @xmath1",
    ", one needs to know the density for asymptotically high masses @xmath38 , when power corrections to the expression ( [ exp ] ) at lower masses can be neglected . in principle ,",
    "knowledge of the functional form of power corrections could enable one to extract @xmath1 accurately from lower masses , but in practice the form is unknown for qcd .",
    "therefore , although exponential growth is clearly occuring , we can only extract a rough estimate for @xmath1 from the numerical data , based on linear fits to figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "there are three systematic sources of error in our estimate .",
    "the first two come from the variation of the data in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , which we take as indicative of the error due to residual dependence on the cutoffs @xmath29 and @xmath10 .",
    "the third comes from the linear fits themselves , since power corrections to eqn .",
    "( [ exp ] ) in the actual data will make the fit result for @xmath1 depend upon the range of masses chosen for the fit .",
    "those intervals are naturally limited above and below : for all the data , smooth linear behaviour does not start until the block of points beginning at @xmath42 ; dlcq artifacts limit the maximum useful value of @xmath43 , roughly @xmath44 for the @xmath35 data respectively . within these limits",
    ", we performed linear fits to the data sets in the figures for a variety of different mass intervals .",
    "the maximum variation of @xmath1 with interval chosen was of order @xmath45 , which we take as indicative of the error made by using simplified fitting function ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "as a result , we estimate @xmath46 , where the first error is due to @xmath29 , second due to @xmath10 , and third from the fits",
    ".    we can also deduce analytic bounds on @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we derived in transverse lattice gauge theory an approximate analytic formula for the number @xmath47 of highly excited glueball states of mass squared @xmath48 , @xmath49 integer .",
    "the derivation was based on the assumption that the glueball masses were governed only by longitudinal dynamics of the transverse link fields and a fixed number of such links in a state . assuming a transverse degeneracy factor @xmath50 for the number of distinct states with @xmath51 links , the formula of ref.@xcite trivially generalises to @xmath52}\\ } \\ , \\label{analytic}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the dilogarithm function .",
    "this leads to a hagedorn temperature @xmath54 } \\ ,   \\label{tc}\\ ] ] the maximum degeneracy one could expect is from a long free chain of @xmath51 links , which on a square transverse lattice gives @xmath55 .",
    "this provides an upper bound on the density of states and hence a lower bound @xmath56 .",
    "conversely , setting @xmath57 corresponds to neglecting transverse structure altogether .",
    "this is a lower bound on the density of states , implying @xmath58 is an upper bound .",
    "the numerical solution investigated above is somewhere between these extremes ; in reality there are non - trivial longitudinal _ and _ transverse dynamics .    recent large-@xmath6 extrapolations of euclidean lattice computations @xcite are more suited to providing accurate determinations of the critical temperature , obtaining @xmath59 .",
    "this is less than the result , @xmath60 , for the non - interacting nambu - goto string @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that the large-@xmath6 gauge theory flux string has more worldsheet degrees of freedom than a simple bosonic one , which has only transverse oscillations . in making this comparison based on @xmath1 with a free string , it is important to use results from the large-@xmath6 limit , since only in this limit do lightcone flux strings not split and join . at finite @xmath6 , by examining only @xmath1 one can not separate physically distinct world - sheet effects from string interaction effects proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "also , the hagedorn determination of @xmath1 directly from the density of states is strictly correct only for a gas of free hadrons / strings .",
    "although euclidean lattice results provide an accurate value for @xmath1 , they do not explain why it differs from the bosonic string value .",
    "transverse lattice gauge theory can provide an explanation with the help of an older analysis by klebanov and susskind @xcite .",
    "they noted that choosing a sufficiently tachyonic link field mass @xmath62 ( see eqn.[ferlag ] ) would drive the theory into a new phase , where glueball states were unstable to becoming infinitely long chains of transverse links , each link with frozen longitudinal dynamics . in this phase",
    ", there are only transverse dynamics ( this is the complete opposite of the scenario used above to derive the bounds ) .",
    "the spectrum of this phase is exactly that of the nambu - goto string @xcite .",
    "thus , at least some of the extra degrees of freedom present in the qcd phase of transverse lattice gauge theory , which can lower the critical temperature , appear to be longitudinal oscillations of the flux string .",
