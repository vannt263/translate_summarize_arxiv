    "recently , hoava has proposed a new theory of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the theory is abandoning the lorentz invariance , with which the theory is made power - counting renormalizable . the broken lorentz invariance results in a preferred foliation of spacetime by three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces , and thus allows to add higher spatial curvature terms to the gravitational lagrangian as well as to modify the kinetic term of the graviton .",
    "obviously , some notable features of hoava gravity become manifest at high energies , which motivates studying the early universe based on hoava s theory  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the broken lorentz invariance , however , persists down to low energies .",
    "this not only brings interesting consequences regarding in particular dark matter in the universe  @xcite , but also causes potential problems stemming from an additional scalar degree of freedom of the graviton that inevitably appears as a result of the reduced symmetry of the theory  @xcite .",
    "some of the troubles are cured in the projectable version of hoava gravity  @xcite and some are still controversial .",
    "several problems have also been reported at a phenomenological level , including a large isocurvature perturbation  @xcite and the absence of static stars  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it is argued by blas , pujols , and sibiryakov that original hoava gravity can be extended in such a way that the lapse function @xmath1 may depend on the spatial coordinate ( i.e. , the theory is not projectable ) and terms constructed from a 3-vector @xmath2 are included in the action  @xcite , which makes @xmath1 dynamical  @xcite . with the appropriate choice of the new terms",
    ", the resultant theory will be free from the problems and pathologies reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the extended theory could still suffer from strong coupling at low energies  @xcite , but it can be evaded by taking into account higher spatial derivative terms in the action  @xcite .",
    "see also the recent paper  @xcite for the strong - coupling issue in the extended version of hoava gravity .",
    "so far cosmological perturbations have been explored in projectable and non - projectable versions of hoava gravity in the vast literature  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to go on in this direction and to study cosmological perturbations in healthfully extended hoava gravity of  @xcite .",
    "we begin with presenting the most general equations for scalar perturbations on a flat cosmological background in extended hoava gravity , and then solve them both analytically and numerically . as for the other aspects of extended hoava gravity , spherically symmetric solutions have been worked out in  @xcite .",

    "since the structure of the kinetic term  ( [ kinetic_term ] ) is the same as in the original version of hoava gravity , the time kinetic term of the scalar graviton remains the same .",

    "@xcite for a preliminary discussion on this point .",
    "in what follows , we are interested in perturbation modes whose spatial momenta are much smaller than @xmath82 and @xmath81 , so that we ignore any uv terms in gravity and matter sectors .",

    "<S> the evolution of metric and density perturbations is addressed analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for vanishing non - adiabatic pressure of matter the large scale evolution of cosmological perturbations converges to that described by a single constant , @xmath0 , which is an analog of a curvature perturbation on the uniform - density slicing commonly used in usual gravitational theories . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent evolution is thus determined completely by the value of @xmath0 . </S>"
