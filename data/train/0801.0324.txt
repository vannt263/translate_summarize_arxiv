    "the @xmath0-theory introduced by kasparov ( @xcite ) is one of the most important tools in the theory of classification of -algebras , of use especially for simple -algebras .",
    "recently , kirchberg has developed the socalled ideal - related @xmath0-theory  a generalisation of kasparov s @xmath0-theory which takes into account the ideal structure of the algebras considered  and obtained strong isomorphism theorems for stable , nuclear , separable , strongly purely infinite -algebras ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained by kirchberg establish ideal - related @xmath0-theory as an essential tool in the classification theory of non - simple -algebras .",
    "@xmath0-theory is a bivariant functor ; to obtain a real classification result one needs a univariant classification functor instead . for ordinary @xmath0-theory this is obtained ( within the bootstrap category ) by invoking the universal coefficient theorem ( uct ) of rosenberg and schochet :    [ thm : rsuct ] let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be separable -algebras in the bootstrap category @xmath6 .",
    "then there is a short exact sequence @xmath7 ( here @xmath8 denotes the graded group @xmath9 ) .",
    "the sequence is natural in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and splits ( unnaturally , in general ) .",
    "moreover , an element @xmath10 in @xmath11 is invertible if and only if @xmath12 is an isomorphism .",
    "this uct allows us to turn isomorphism results ( such as kirchberg - phillips theorem @xcite ) into strong classification theorems .",
    "moreover , using the splitting , it allows us to determine completely the additive structure of the @xmath13-groups .    to transform kirchberg s general result into a strong classification theorem",
    ", one would need a uct for ideal - related @xmath0-theory .",
    "this was achieved by bonkat ( @xcite ) in the special case where the specified ideal structure is just a single ideal .",
    "progress into more general cases with finitely many ideals has recently been announced by mayer - nest and by the second named author , but in this paper we will only consider the case with one specified ideal :    [ bonkat s uct , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* satz 7.5.3 , satz 7.7.1 , and proposition 7.7.2)][thm : bonkatuct ] let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be extensions of separable , nuclear -algebras in the bootstrap category @xmath6 .",
    "then there is a short exact sequence @xmath16 ( here @xmath17 is the standard cyclic six term exact sequence , @xmath18 is the category of cyclic six term chain complexes , and @xmath19 denotes the extension obtained by tensoring all the -algebras in the extension @xmath20 with @xmath21 ) .",
    "the sequence is natural in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , an element @xmath24 is invertible if and only if @xmath25 is an isomorphism .",
    "bonkat leaves open the question of whether this uct splits in general .",
    "we prove here that this is not always the case , even in the fundamental case considered by bonkat ( see proposition  [ prop : nonsplitting]([prop : nonsplitting - item1 ] ) below ) .",
    "this observation tells us  in contrast to the ordinary @xmath0-theory  that we can not , in general , completely determine the additive structure of @xmath26 just by using the uct .",
    "it is comforting to note , as may be inferred from the results in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , that this has only marginal impact on the usefulness of bonkat s result in the context of classification of e.g.  the -algebras considered by kirchberg .",
    "but as we shall see it has several repercussions concerning the classification of homomorphisms and automorphisms of such @xmath3-algebras , and opens an intriguing discussion  which it is our ambition to close elsewhere ( @xcite ) in the important special case of cuntz - krieger algebras satisfying condition ( ii )  on the nature of an invariant classifying such morphisms .",
    "indeed , examples abound in classification theory in which the invariant needed to classify automorphims up to approximate unitary equivalence on a certain class of -algebras is more complicated than the classifying invariant for the algebras themselves .",
    "for instance , even though @xmath8 is a classifying invariant for stable kirchberg algebras ( i.e.   nuclear , separable , simple , purely infinite -algebras ) one needs to turn to _ total _",
    "@xmath1-theory  the collection of @xmath8 and all torsion coefficient groups @xmath27  in order to obtain exactness of @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the group of automorphisms of @xmath4 that are approximately unitarily equivalent to @xmath30 and the subscript @xmath31 indicates that the group isomorphism on @xmath32 must commute with all the natural _ bockstein _ operations .",
    "the appearance of total @xmath1-theory in is explained by the universal multicoefficient theorem obtained by dadarlat and loring in @xcite :    [ umct ] let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be separable -algebras in the bootstrap category @xmath6 .",
    "then there is a short exact sequence @xmath33 ( here @xmath34 denotes the subgroup of @xmath35 consisting of pure extensions , and @xmath36 denotes the group of homomorphisms respecting the bockstein operations ) .",
    "the sequence is natural in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and an element @xmath10 in @xmath11 is invertible if and only if the induced element is an isomorphism .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 is zero whenever the @xmath1-theory of @xmath4 is finitely generated .",
    "dadarlat has pointed out to us that although @xcite states that the umct splits in general , this is not true .",
    "the problem can be traced to one in @xcite , cf.@xcite and @xcite .    in the stably finite case , as exemplified by stable real rank zero @xmath38 algebras , the umct leads to exactness of @xmath39 in which the subscript `` @xmath40 '' indicates the presence of positivity conditions ( see @xcite for details ) . noting the way the usage of a six term exact sequence in @xcite parallels the usage of positivity in the stably finite case ( cf.@xcite ) it is natural to speculate ( as indeed the first named author did at the first abel symposium , cf .",
    "@xcite ) that by combining all coefficient six term exact sequences into an invariant @xmath41 one obtains an exact sequence of the form @xmath42 & \\overline{{\\mathrm{inn } } } ( e ) \\ar[r ] & { \\mathrm{aut}}(e ) \\ar[r ] & { \\mathrm{aut}}_\\lambda ( { \\ensuremath{\\underline{\\mathit{k}}_{\\mathrm{six}}}\\xspace } ( e ) ) \\ar[r ] & \\{1\\ } , } \\ ] ] and to search for a corresponding umct along the lines of theorem [ umct ] .",
    "this sequence is clearly a chain complex , but as we will see , the natural map from @xmath43 to @xmath44 is not injective nor is it surjective in general for extensions @xmath22 and @xmath23 with finitely generated @xmath1-theory ( see proposition  [ prop : nonsplitting]([prop : nonsplitting - item2]),([prop : nonsplitting - item3 ] ) ) , and we will give an example of an extension of stable kirchberg algebras in the bootstrap category @xmath6 with finitely generated @xmath1-theory , such that is only exact at @xmath45 , telling us in unmistakable terms that this is the wrong invariant to use .",
    "our methods are based on computations related to a class of extensions which , we believe , should be thought of as a substitute for the total @xmath1-theory of relevance in the classification of , e.g. , non - simple , stably finite -algebras with real rank zero .",
    "we shall undertake a more systematic study of these objects elsewhere , and show there how they may be employed to the task of computing kirchberg s groups @xmath46 .",
