    "these low velocity shocks plus the width of the observed optical lines suggested to hhr that the hh80/81 objects correspond to `` wings '' of a highly adiabatic bow shock that strikes the surrounding gas at @xmath26 km s@xmath2 ; in such wings the shock front would be oblique with respect to the direction of motion , resulting in lower shock velocities .",

    "it is easy to show that for typical dust grains of radius 0.1@xmath0 m  and density of 3 g@xmath24 , the optical depth along the diameter of a spherical clump of radius @xmath62 and particle density @xmath63 can be written as :    @xmath64    where @xmath63 is in @xmath24 , @xmath62 is in seconds of arc and the distance @xmath65 is in parsecs . in the fuv range the absorption coefficient q@xmath66 ( draine & lee @xcite ) , and for the typical parameters that we will derive ( see table  [ resmodelhh ] ) we obtain @xmath67 .",
    "we emphasize that this number refers to the longest path across the clump , so only a small portion at the far side of the clump , with respect to any line of sight , will be only partially thick .",

    "the value of @xmath60 is computed using its relationship ( dopita , binette & schwartz  @xcite ) with the degree of excitation measured by the [ oiii]5007/[oi]6300  ratio ; we use the [ oiii]5007  and [ oi]6300  line fluxes from hrr to derive values of 2 for the hh objects and 13 for the jet .",
    "we adopt shock velocities of 100 km s@xmath2  for all hh objects from the measured [ oiii]88.3@xmath0m/[nii]122@xmath0mratio .",
    "model results are weakly dependent on the cavity radius , for which we adopt a fiducial value of r=10@xmath19 .",

    "for all hh objects we obtain densities which are below 10@xmath23@xmath24 , for which @xmath87 collisional population would depress the two - photon continuum due to ly@xmath10 decay .",
    "the presence of a transverse ( @xmath88  @xmath89@xmath90 ) magnetic field limits the compression ratio ; we can write ( hollenbach & mckee  @xcite )    @xmath91 \\sqrt{{n}\\over { { \\mathcal{r}}^3}}~\\mu { \\rm g } \\label{boperp}\\ ] ]    using the parameters from table [ resmodelhh ] we see that @xmath92varies from 100 to 200 @xmath0 g .",
    "we ran additional shock models using these large @xmath92  values and found that the only way to reproduce the observed line ratios is to assume a pre - shock ionization fraction @xmath93 .",
    "this is higher than the higher values ( 0.2 - 0.3 ) found toward several hh - jets by bacciotti & eislffel ( @xcite ) ; on the other hand the hh80/81 flow is the most powerful in its class and may be peculiar in its ionization fraction as well .",
    "as far as the other positions along the jet are concerned , our model has less diagnostic power because of the high number of free parameters in the reynolds ( @xcite ) model for radio emission from ionised jets .",
    "[ diag2 ] is the analogous for the jet of fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] , where grids of models are plotted as a function of density @xmath63 in @xmath24and half - width w@xmath94 , in arcseconds , of the jets at its base . while @xmath68 and @xmath60 are kept fixed to 0.002 ( from our observations ) and 13 ( see above ) , the jet parameters are essentially free .",
    "the full - line grid represent the `` pressure - confined '' jet in reynolds terminology , where the density , temperature and ionization radial gradients of the jet have values [ q@xmath95 , q@xmath96 , q@xmath97=[-0.9 , -0.6 , -0.5 ] ; in this particular jet the degree of collimation , expressed by a number @xmath98 which controls the jet s width as a function of radial distance ( w@xmath99 ) , is @xmath100 .",
    "another critical parameter , which we can not independently fix , is the distance from the central source where the jet is injected ; the full - line grid in fig .",
    "[ diag2 ] is obtained for r@xmath94=10 @xmath101 .",
    "this model predicts too much radio flux compared to the observations ; other classes of standard models in reynolds study are even less successful .",
    "although of uncertain physical meaning , other combinations of the jet parameters can bring the predicted radio fluxes closer to the values observed along the hh80/81 jet .",
    "steepening the density gradient to q@xmath95=-2 ( dotted grid ) will decrease the radio flux by more than an order of magnitude ; a less pronounced effect in the same direction is obtained by decreasing the temperature gradient to , e.g. , q@xmath96=-1 ( dashed grid ) .",
    "providing additional collimation by lowering @xmath98 down to , e.g. , 0.2 ( dashed - dotted grid ) , will also contribute to a better match between the model and the data . finally ,",
    "decreasing the jet - injection distance from the source , r@xmath94 , will also work toward lowering the predicted radio flux .",
    "although there is no single set of jet parameters that can fit the data , our model suggests steep density and/or temperature radial gradients along the jet , as well as a very high degree of collimation which is not ruled out by the observations ( mrr93 ) .",
    "looking at the shape of the models grids in fig .",
    "[ diag2 ] , it seems that a single jet model , i.e. a single model grid , can not reproduce the [ f@xmath102 , f@xmath37 ] values of iras18162 - 2048 and the two off positions .",
    "this is not due to the misalignment between the observed off positions and the jet axis .",
    "a better alignment would not have changed the radio flux ( which we arbitrarily assigned based on the 6 cm map of mrr93 ) ; likewise , a half - lws beam shift in the iso observed positions would certainly not result in a one order of magnitude decrease of the [ cii]158@xmath0mline fluxes , as required to bring the off positions onto the model grid in fig .",
    "[ diag2 ] .",
    "rather , it is plausible that the central ( brighter ) portion of the jet considerably contributes to the fuv irradiation of the flow cavities at the two off positions .",
    "this would indeed correspond to increasing the assigned radio flux to the two off positions in fig .",
    "[ diag2 ] .",
    "although it was one of the motivations to develop our model , one of the consequences of the model is that a f@xmath102-f@xmath37 relationship is difficult to justify .",
    "the radio flux has a different origin in the hh objects and the jet , there is _ a priori _ no reason why iras18162 - 2048 ( where we model the radio flux as coming from a jet ) should line up with the three hh objects ( where we model the radio flux as coming from the post - shock region ) in fig .",
    "[ fcii_f6 ] .",
    "the relative position of the hh objects themselves is also _ a priori _ depending on a high number of free parameters .",
    "based on four points only , we must then conclude that the f@xmath102-f@xmath37 relationship in fig .",
    "[ fcii_f6 ] appears to be fortuitous .",
    "however , we will check for similar occurrences in other hh / jet systems where [ cii]158@xmath0mdata are available and where the densities are low enough ( @xmath104 @xmath24 ) that a shock / jet@xmath105pdr connection can be expected .",
    "we have performed a far - ir spectroscopic study of the hh80/81 system .",
    "line ratio analysis confirms for the first time the herbig - haro nature of the nebulosity hh80n , which probably represents the head of the counterflow to hh80 and 81 .",
    "we reveal shock velocities of the order of 100 km s@xmath2  in correspondence with the hh objects , while lower excitation conditions appear to be present elsewhere along the radio jet . a comparison with proper motion velocities in excess of 600 km s@xmath2indicate that the shocks arise at the interface between two fast - moving flows .",
    "besides shock - excited emission , an important pdr contribution is present all along the bipolar flow , where densities below 10@xmath23 @xmath24  are also diagnosed . using a simple model , we have provided quantitative arguments supporting the idea that the fuv field radiated by the ionised material of the recombination regions in the hh objects and of the jet emanating from iras18162 - 2048 , is able to induce the formation of a pdr in the immediately surrounding medium ( i.e. the flow cavity walls ) .",
    "this would provide further evidence that the jet / hh own radiation field affects its surrounding medium in a measurable way .",
    "attempts to model the chemistry of outflows should not ignore the influence of the radiation field of the shocks responsible for the acceleration of the outflow itself .",
