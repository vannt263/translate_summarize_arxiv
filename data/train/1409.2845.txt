    "the strain control of magnetization orientation distribution in magnetic thin films _ via _ the magnetoelastic or the magnetostrictive properties , is increasingly studied to face new challenges in magnetoelectronics and spintronics @xcite .",
    "an easy way for mastering the magnetization is to make adhering the thin film on a piezoelectric actuator , so that the strains can be applied to the film by varying continuously a voltage on the piezoelectric actuator .",
    "this latter will succeed in transferring the strains in a more or less efficient way , depending on the chosen system .",
    "obviously , more the elastic strains are transferred at the interface , more the indirect magnetoelectric effect is optimized .",
    "generally , at a first step , the magnetic thin films are deposited on a substrate of usually one hundred microns thick . at a second step",
    "the film / substrate is cemented on an actuator @xcite . at this point",
    "two interfaces will play their role in the transmission of strains : the actuator / substrate interface and the substrate / film one .",
    "this double transfer limits the desired phenomenon , especially when the substrate is stiff such as for commonly used wafer ( si , gaas , ... ) @xcite . besides , in this configuration",
    ", it is generally hard to predict perfectly the amount of the induced strains inside the thin film ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) even if the piezoelectric coefficients @xmath3 of the actuator are known .",
    "this is due to the partial strains transmissions from the actuator to the substrate , especially in the case of stiff substrates .",
    "this well - known reported limitation ( a few ten percents of losses in best cases ) can be avoided by depositing the magnetic thin film on a compliant substrate such as polyimides that are more and more used in flexible spintronics @xcite .",
    "more precisely we reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , by comparing film and actuator strains , that one advantage of studying thin films on polymer substrates is the very good strains transmissions ( nearly 100% ) resulting from the substrate compliance .",
    "however , once well - known strains are transferred to the film , the estimation of the stresses ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) is straightforward only if the elastic coefficients of this latter are known .",

    "the magnetic anisotropy dependence upon the applied stress has been followed by measuring the behavior of the high frequency resonance field while applying an electric field inside the actuator .",
    "this resonance field is directly linked to the magnetic anisotropy and it can be estimated by performing micro - strip ferromagnetic resonance ( ms - fmr ) @xcite experiments in several geometrical configurations ( section iv ) . moreover , by adjusting an appropriate model ( section ii ) to the experimental data , we have shown how to estimate with accuracy the thin film effective magnetostriction coefficient at saturation ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the voltage - induced strain effect has been experimentally studied by ferromagnetic resonance through uniform precession mode resonance field as a function of the applied voltage .",
    "indeed , the resonance field ( or resonance frequency ) of the uniform precession mode is influenced by the magnetoelastic behavior of the thin film .",
    "all the experimental spectra presented in this work have been performed at room temperature . moreover , they have been done at relatively `` high '' applied magnetic field in order to have a uniform magnetization inside the film .",
    "the expression of the resonance field is derived taking into account in - plane strains ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "these in - plane strains will be induced by applying an electric field inside the piezoelectric actuator .",
    "when any magnetoelastic contribution is required , the magnetic energy density of a ferromagnetic thin film , using the coordinates system of [ fig_sketch_fmr ] , can be written as :    @xmath11    where the three first terms stand for the zeeman , the dipolar and the exchange contributions , respectively .",
    "the last term , which corresponds to the anisotropy contribution , will be written as an _ ad hoc _ in - plane uniaxial anisotropy characterized by the anisotropy constant @xmath12 .",
    "this is correct when no out - of - plane or surface contributions to the anisotropy are observed in the film .",
    "this term can then be written as : @xmath13    @xmath14 is a unit vector along the `` easy axis '' ( along @xmath15 direction ) while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the vector and the module of the magnetization .",

    "the presence of a unique saturation magnetostriction coefficient @xmath8 is due to the amorphous structure of the thin film .",
    "the relation between the principal stress components ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and strains ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) tensors is thus given by an isotropic hook s law where @xmath6 is the young s modulus and @xmath7 is the poisson s ratio :    _ xx & = ( ) ( _ xx+_yy)[eq : hook_law_1 ] + _ yy & = ( ) ( _ yy+_xx)[eq : hook_law_2 ]    in these conditions , minimizing the total volume magnetic energy density ( i. e. @xmath23 ) , the resonance field of the uniform precession mode can be obtained thanks to the following relation @xcite : @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the microwave driving frequency .",

    "indeed , in this condition , the magnetization direction will be almost parallel to the applied magnetic field ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the resonance field is thus given by :    @xmath37    the first term essentially represents a constant shift in the resonance field baseline because @xmath38 and @xmath39 are found to be larger than the magnetoelastic and the uniaxial anisotropy fields .",

    "the 80 v value was chosen because of the `` exact '' compensation of this uniaxial anisotropy by the induced magnetoelastic one .",
    "at this voltage , the film is in - plane isotropic in the magnetic point of view .",
    "it is experimentally confirmed by the circle shape formed by the open circles . finally , at 100 v , a uniaxial anisotropy characterized by a vertical peanut shape is observed along @xmath79 axis ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus , a voltage - switch of the effective easy axis from @xmath15 direction ( at 0 v ) to @xmath79 direction ( at 100 v ) has been performed .",
    "the sketches of figure [ fig_resonance_0v]b qualitatively present such effect . finally , the solid lines of figure [ fig_resonance_0v]a are calculated thanks to equation [ eq : resonance_field ] with the parameters previously determined .",

    "we have shown that the flexibility of kapton substrate allowed tailoring the magnetic anisotropy of the film by applying small voltage - induced strains . *",
    "the flexibility of the kapton substrate induced an initial uniaxial anisotropy that is generally not found in ferromagnetic films whose thickness is a few hundred nanometers . * the knowledge of the applied elastic strains _ versus _ applied voltage measured by digital image correlation and finemet film elastic constants measured by brillouin light scattering allowed estimating the effective magnetostriction coefficient of the film .",
