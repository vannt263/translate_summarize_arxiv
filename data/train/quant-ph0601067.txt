    "parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) consumes pump photons and produces light with a two - photon field description @xcite .",
    "this two - photon light , which allows one photon to indicate or herald the existence of its twin , has a key role in applications such as quantum radiometry @xcite , where it makes possible an independent primary standard method for direct photon - counting detector calibrations .",
    "in addition , this two - photon light is key to improve single - photon source schemes that have significant advantages over the attenuated laser sources often employed in quantum information @xcite applications . to realize a single - photon source @xcite appropriate for these applications , we consider two key issues- a ) efficient photon pair production and b ) collection of the heralded photon in a single - mode fiber , which is of interest for telecom applications .",
    "periodically poled crystals ( ppls ) have been used for efficient pair production @xcite , but have not yet been used for metrology . while metrology applications would certainly benefit from the high pump - conversion efficiency of ppls , characteristics such as",
    "the level of background fluorescence may limit the uncertainty that can be achieved .    as for the collection efficiency of pdc light into a single - mode fiber ,",
    "the goal has been to understand how the detection of one photon of a pdc pair in a well defined spatial and spectral mode , defines its partner s spatial and spectral mode that can then be efficiently collected .",
    "recent efforts have included experimental and theoretical work in both continuous wave ( cw ) @xcite and pulse - pumped @xcite bulk crystal pdc , and have highlighted the critical problem of coupling the pdc photons into single - mode fibers ( smf ) due to the difficulty of spatial and spectral matching of the photon pairs .",
    "the results show that optimization of the heralding efficiency is very sensitive to spectral and spatial mode selection .    here",
    "we describe a pdc source and a measurement technique and compare it to other configurations .",
    "we present theoretical and experimental characterizations of the photon collection problem and suggest possible solutions .",
    "we pumped ( fig . [",
    "fig : fig1met ] ) a 5 mm long periodically poled mgo - doped lithium niobate ( ppln ) crystal with a cw laser at 532 nm .",
    "we used noncritical phase - matching ( 90@xmath0 phase - matching angle ) with a 7.36 @xmath1 m poling period to produce 810 nm and 1550 nm photon pairs at external angles of 1@xmath2 and 2@xmath2 .",
    "we achieved fine tuning by adjusting the crystal temperature near 131@xmath0 c. lens @xmath3 in the pump beam produced a gaussian beam waist of @xmath4144@xmath1 m at the crystal ; cutoff filter f@xmath5 blocked the pump laser ; and dichroic mirror dm separated the 810 nm ( beam 1 ) and 1550 nm ( beam 2 ) photons .",
    "an extra interference filter ( @xmath6 ) at 810 nm with a full width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 10 nm suppressed extra fluorescence from the ppln to reduce background heralding counts , while the smf geometry imposed spectral selection with a heralding bandwidth , @xmath7 of @xmath82 nm fwhm ( see table i ) .",
    "l@xmath9 were aspheric coupling lenses of focal length 8 mm , ar - coated for 810 nm and 1550 nm . a monochromator in the heralding arm measured its spectral width .",
    "the heralding arm was routed to a smf and then to d@xmath10 , a si avalanche photodiode ( apd ) , while the heralded arm also coupled to a smf , was sent to d@xmath11 , an ingaas apd operating in gated mode .",
    "we gated the ingaas detector with the detection of an 810 nm photon in the heralding arm and adjusted the delay of the heralded arm with appropriate length smf and electronic cables .",
    "calibrating the ingaas detector , including the smf and coupling lens optical losses against a conventional detector standard using an attenuated laser source , yielded a detection efficiency of @xmath12 ( _ _ k__=1 , absolute uncertainty ) .",
    "the heralded d@xmath11 detector efficiency as measured by the pdc source is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the heralding efficiency ( single - mode preparation efficiency , discussed in the next section ) @xcite , @xmath15 is the overall heralded arm optical transmittance ( including ppln , f@xmath5 , and dm ) , and @xmath16 is the optical transmittance of l@xmath11 and the smf on the heralded arm .",

    "the decrease of @xmath91 for bigger @xmath101 is in agreement with the measured decrease of @xmath17 .",

    "we limited the calculation of the mismatch term to first order in the transverse k - vector and the frequency , losing some of the correlation between the frequency and the spatial variables in the biphoton field @xcite .",
    "to compensate , we introduced a selection term due to the smf spatial selection , but that works best for the degenerate case where the pdc emission is broader and this correction has less of an effect on the final mode matching than in the nondegenerate case .",

    "we have shown the feasibility of using ppln for single - photon detector calibration at 1550 nm , as well as for a single - photon single - mode source .",
