    "old open clusters , with ages greater than @xmath9 gyr , are an important tool for the study of the formation and the early evolution of the galactic disk ( friel 1995 ; chen , hou , & wang 2003 ) .",
    "trumpler 5 ( tr 5 ; @xmath10 = 06@xmath11 36@xmath12 32@xmath13 , @xmath14 = + 09   29   25 , j2000.0 ) is located in anti - galactic center region with very small galactic latitude ( @xmath15 = 202.86 , @xmath16 = + 01.05 ) .",
    "dow & hawarden ( 1970 ) obtained distance modulus @xmath17 and reddening @xmath18 which give a true distance modulus of @xmath19 ( d=2.4 kpc ) using total - to - selective extinction ratio of @xmath20 , though their color - magnitude diagram have some scatter ( janes & adler 1982 ) .",
    "kalinowski ( 1974 ) and kalinowski et al . ( 1974 ) observed a very red ( @xmath21 6.1 mag ) carbon star , v493 mon , and suggested that this star is possibly a member of tr 5 adopting @xmath22 ( d=@xmath23 kpc ) and @xmath24 for tr 5 .",
    "kalinowski ( 1975 ) performed photoelectric and photographic photometry for 1300 stars in tr 5 , and presented the visual absorption a@xmath25 mag and diameter of 12(8.4 pc ) for tr 5 at an assumed true distance modulus of @xmath26 ( d=@xmath27 kpc ) .",
    "piccirillo , kalinowski , & wing ( 1977 ) found three m giants , three k giants , and another carbon star with a color temperature of about 4000 k. these authors adopted @xmath28 ( d=1.9 kpc ) and @xmath29 for tr 5 .",
    "kalinowski ( 1979 ) have used @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which gives @xmath32 ( d=1.0 kpc ) using @xmath20 ( janes & adler 1982 ) .",
    "recently , kaluzny ( 1998 ) have obtained @xmath33 ccd photometry of tr 5 using kitt peak national observatory 2.1 m and 0.9 m telescopes .",
    "he has obtained the parameters for tr 5 as @xmath34 ( d=3.0 kpc ) , @xmath35 , and age of 4.1 gyr ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , kaluzny obtained the reddening and age of tr 5 by comparing the photometric values of tr 5 and m67 ( montgomery et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "in this paper we present a new analysis of the data for tr 5 obtained by kaluzny ( 1998 ) .",
    "section 2 describes the data sets used in this study and section 3 presents the color - magnitude diagrams of tr 5 . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "the physical parameters of tr 5 , such as reddening , distance , metallicity and age , are derived .",
    "section 6 discusses the comparison of the derived results with those of kaluzny ( 1998 ) and the metallicity - galactocentric radius relation .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions are given in secion 7 .",
    "j. kaluzny performed the observations of tr 5 at the kitt peak national observatory on 1990 nov .",
    "11 ( run # 1 ; kpno 2.1 m telescope + tek1 ccd ) , on 1991 oct . 6 ( run # 2 ; kpno 2.1 m telescope + t1ka ccd ) , and on 1991 oct .",
    "10  11 ( run # 3 ; kpno 0.9 m telescope + t1ka ccd ) . the details on the observations and data reduction can be found in kaluzny ( 1998 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the fields covered by the three data sets superposed on the digitized sky survey image of tr 5 .",
    "the non - rectangular shape of the field # 3 shows that the photometry data of the field # 3 in cds does not contain all the data of the stars in the rectangular field .",
    "the data sets from the three observing runs were calibrated independently , giving systematic differences less than 0.02 mag .",
    "the photometric errors in the magnitude from the cds data given by kaluzny ( 1998 ) are plotted against the @xmath37 magnitude in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath38 and @xmath39 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the measured stars in tr 5 .",
    "upper panels are for the stars of good photometric qualities and lower panels are for all the observed stars .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( d ) are for observing run # 1 , ( b ) and ( e ) are for the run # 2 , and ( c ) and ( f ) are for the run # 3 .",
    "the distinguishable features seen in the cmds of figure 3 are : ( i ) there is a well - defined main - sequence , the top of which is probably located at @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 mag ( see figure 2 of kaluzny ( 1994 ) for the definitions of main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) ) ; ( ii ) there is a well - developed red giant branch and red giant clump ( rgc ) stars at @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 mag , which is noted by crosses in the figures ; ( iii ) as it goes from panel ( a ) to ( b ) and to ( c ) , the total number of stars increases , the thickness of the main - sequence stars increases and there exist more stars ( probably field stars ) brighter than the msto at @xmath46 mag , which is reasonable and expectable since the observing run # 1 covers the smallest area and the run # 3 covers the widest area .",
    "since tr 5 is located at low galactic latitude ( @xmath47 + 01.05 ) , it is expectable that the interstellar reddening toward tr 5 could be significant .",
    "we have estimated the reddening toward tr 5 using the mean color of the rgc stars .",
    "janes & phelps ( 1994 ) estimated the mean color and magnitude of the rgc in old open clusters to be @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , when the @xmath37 magnitude difference between the rgc and the main - sequence turn - off of the clusters , @xmath50 , is greater than one .",
    "the mean colors of the rgc are estimated to be @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the corresponding mean magnitude is @xmath53 mag .",
    "@xmath50 is estimated to be @xmath54 mag , and the resulting reddening value is estimated to be @xmath0 .",
    "using the mean magnitude of the rgc ( janes & phelps 1994 ) and that of the rgc of tr 5 obtained in the previous section , we have estimated the distance modulus of tr 5 as @xmath55 .    for the stars common in the data sets of # 1 and # 2 , we have plotted the color - magnitude diagrams in figure 4 and superimposed the zams relation ( sung & bessell 1999 ; sung 2001 ) and the theoretical isochrones of padova group ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) which are reddened by @xmath56 and @xmath57 and shifted according to the apparent distance modulus of @xmath58 ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) and @xmath59 ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "we have used the metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath60 and the age of 2.4 gyr for tr 5 .",
    "the distance modulus of @xmath58 gives better fit to the main - sequence and sub - giant branch than that of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath62 as our final value . using the reddening values of @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "obtained above and the total - to - selective extiontion ratio ( guetter & vrba 1989 ) , @xmath63 we get @xmath64 , @xmath65 mag , and the true distance modulus of @xmath66 mag ( d @xmath2 kpc ) .",
    "we also have estimated the cluster age using the morphological age index ( mai ) which was introduced by phelps , janes , & montgomery ( 1994 ) .",
    "we used the relation between the mai and @xmath50 given by phelps et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and janes & phelps ( 1994 ) , @xmath67 = 0.73 \\times 10^{(0.256 \\delta v + 0.0662 \\delta v^2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 represents the @xmath37 magnitude difference between the rgc and the msto of the clusters . from the value of @xmath50 derived in section iv , @xmath54 mag ,",
    "we obtain a value for the age , mai @xmath68 gyr .",
    "even though the mai was only intended to provide a relative age ranking of clusters , this age is consistent with the value obtained above from the isochrone fitting within the error range .",
    "figure 5 shows the padova isochrone fitting with three age values of 2.0 ( left dotted lines ) , 2.4 ( solid lines ) , and 2.8 ( right dotted lines ) gyr .",
    "finally , we take the age and the metallicity of tr 5 as @xmath4 gyr and [ fe / h ] @xmath3 dex , respectively .",
    "kaluzny ( 1998 ) has obtained the age of tr 5 to be @xmath69 gyr by estimating the @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( the difference in color between the cluster s msto and the red giant branch at the level of the clump ) .",
    "but the difficulty in estimating the position of the msto , as he stated , as well as the locus of red giant branch and the position of the rgc itself , gives difference in the obtained ages between that of kaluzny and ours ( 2.4 gyr ) .",
    "kaluzny also obtained the reddening values of tr 5 , @xmath35 and @xmath72 , by comparing the colors of the rgcs of tr 5 and m67 assuming the age of 4.1 gyr and metallicity the same as that of m67 for tr 5 .",
    "he derived the distance of tr 5 as @xmath73 by comparing the @xmath74-band luminosity of the rgc of tr 5 and the absolute @xmath74-band luminosity of red clump stars in the solar vicinity obtained from the hipparcos distances ( @xmath75 ) .    in figure 6",
    "we showed the padova isochrone fittings using the parameters of tr 5 derived by kaluzny ( 1998 ) : age=4.1 gyr , [ fe / h]=0.00 dex , @xmath35 , @xmath72 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , on ( a ) the @xmath39 color - magnitude diagram for the stars commonly contained in the photometry files of observing runs # 1 and # 2 , and color - magnitude diagrams for the stars of observing runs # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 in panels ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "it is clearly seen that the parameters given by kaluzny do not fit well the color - magnitude diagrams of observed stars .",
    "figure 7 shows the padova isochrone fittings using the parameters of tr 5 derived in this study : age=2.4 gyr , [ fe / h]=@xmath78 dex , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , on ( a ) the @xmath39 color - magnitude diagram for the stars commonly contained in the photometry files of the observing runs # 1 and # 2 , and color - magnitude diagrams for the stars of the observing runs # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 in panels ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "comparison of figures 6 and 7 shows that the parameters derived in this study better fits the observed color - magnitude diagrams . since the ratio of field stars and binary stars to the member stars of tr 5 might increases as we go from panels ( a ) to ( d ) ,",
    "the good fitting of the isochrone in figure 7 ( a ) ( and ( b ) ) is noteworthy among the four panels .",
    "it is known that open clusters that are mainly in the galactic disk follow the negative radial gradient of metallicity just as h  ii regions , bright blue stars , red giants , and planetary nebulae ( portinari & chiosi 1999 ; hou , prantzos , & boissier 2000 ) . from the studies of open clusters ,",
    "various authors have presented the slope of the galactocentric radial [ fe / h ] gradient ( @xmath6[fe / h]/@xmath81 ) : @xmath82 dex kpc@xmath8 ( friel 1995 ) , @xmath83 dex kpc@xmath8 ( carraro , ng , & portinari 1998 ) , @xmath84 dex kpc@xmath8 ( park & lee 1999 ) , and @xmath85 dex kpc@xmath8 ( friel 1999 ) . based on updated abundance calibration of spectroscopic indices measuring fe and fe - peak element blends on 39 old open clusters , friel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have estimated the abundance gradient of @xmath85 dex kpc@xmath8 over a range in the galactocentric radii of 7 to 16 kpc . from compilation of 119 open cluster catalogs , chen , hou , & wang ( 2003 )",
    "have estimated the gradient of @xmath86 dex kpc@xmath8 .    compiling the data of old open clusters given by friel ( 1995 ) , wee & lee ( 1996 ) , kassis , friel , & phelps ( 1996 ) , lee ( 1997 ) , ann , park , & kang ( 1998 ) , and friel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we made our catalog file of 50 old open clusters .",
    "we adopted the galactocentric distance of the sun as 8.5 kpc .",
    "figure 8 shows the galactocentric radial [ fe / h ] gradient for the 50 old open clusters .",
    "open square and filled square are the position of tr 5 based on the parameters given by kaluzny ( 1998 ; @xmath87 kpc ) and this study ( @xmath88 kpc ) , respectively .",
    "the solid line is a least - squares fit to the data that yields an [ fe / h ] gradient of @xmath6[fe / h]/@xmath89 dex kpc@xmath8 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the values obtained by others , especially with the values derived from recent studies and the position of tr 5 in figure 8 obtained by using the parameters derived in this study is more consistent with the mean trend of the other old open clusters .",
    "we have presented the analysis of the photometry of the old open cluster tr 5 using the cds archival data obtained by kaluzny .",
    "we have redetermined the reddening , distance , metallicity , and age of this cluster and summarized them in table 1 .",
    "these parameters are more consistent with the galactocentric radial [ fe / h ] gradient from other old open clusters .",
    "sck is grateful to in - soo yuk for providing his routines of the padova isochrones .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee , prof . h. b. ann for his careful reading of the manuscript which helped to clarify several issues .",
    "we employed catalogues from cds / simbad ( strasbourg ) and digitized sky survey images from the space telescope science institute .",
