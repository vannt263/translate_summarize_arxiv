    "this paper revolves around the excess degree of a @xmath1-dimensional polytope @xmath2 , or simply @xmath1-polytope , and some of its applications .",
    "we define the _ excess degree _",
    "@xmath0 , or simply excess , of a @xmath1-polytope @xmath2 as the sum of the excess degrees of its vertices , i.e. @xmath14 here as usual @xmath15 denotes the _ degree _ of a vertex @xmath16 , i.e  the number of edges of @xmath2 incident with the vertex ; @xmath17 denotes the set of vertices of @xmath2 ; and @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the number of vertices and edges of the polytope .",
    "our first substantial result , in  3 , is the excess theorem : the smallest values of the excess degree of @xmath1-polytopes are 0 and @xmath7 ; clearly a polytope is simple if , and only if , its excess degree is 0 .",
    "note that for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath4 , the possible values of the excess are either all even or all odd .",
    "we further show that if @xmath1 is even , the excess degree takes every even natural number from @xmath18 onwards ; while , if @xmath1 is odd , the excess degree takes every natural number from @xmath19 onwards .",
    "so , for a fixed @xmath1 , only a finite number of gaps in the values of the excess of a @xmath1-polytope are possible .    in  4 , we study @xmath1-polytopes with excess strictly less than @xmath1 , and establish some similarities with simple polytopes . in particular , they are either pyramids or decomposable .",
    "( a polytope @xmath2 is _ ( minkowski ) decomposable _ if it can be written as the minkowski sum of two polytopes , neither of which are homothetic to @xmath2 ; otherwise it is _",
    "indecomposable_. ) a polytope can have excess @xmath8 only if @xmath9 or 5 , which shows that there are infinitely many gaps in the possible values of the excess degree .",
    "polytopes with excess @xmath7 exist in all dimensions , but their structure is very restricted : either there is a unique nonsimple vertex , or there is a @xmath20-face containing only vertices with excess degree @xmath21 . a similar , but slightly more complicated , situation arises for excess @xmath8 : a 5-polytope with excess 4 may also contain 2 vertices with excess degree 2 .    in  5 , we characterise all the decomposable @xmath1-polytopes with @xmath12 or fewer vertices",
    "; this incidentally proves that a conditionally decomposable @xmath1-polytope must have at least @xmath22 vertices .",
    "the final application , in  7 , is the completion of the @xmath13 table for @xmath23 ; that is , we give all the possible values of @xmath13 for which there exists a @xmath1-polytope with @xmath24 , @xmath4 vertices and @xmath5 edges .",
    "the solution of this problem for @xmath25 was already well known ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "the same result has recently been independently obtained by kusunoki and murai @xcite .",
    "our proof requires some results of independent interest ; in particular , a characterisation of the 4-polytopes with 10 vertices and minimum number of edges ( namely , 21 ) ; this is completed in  6 .",
    "we have more comprehensive results characterising polytopes with a given number of vertices and minimum possible number of edges , details of which will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "most of our results tacitly assume that the dimension @xmath1 is at least 3 .",
    "when @xmath26 , all polytopes are both simple and simplicial , and the reader can easily see which theorems remain valid in this case .",
    "in this subsection we group a number of basic results on polytopes which we will use throughout the paper . recall that a _ facet _ of a @xmath1-polytope is a face of dimension @xmath8 ; a _ ridge _ is a face of dimension @xmath7 ; and a _ subridge _ is a face of dimension @xmath27 .",
    "a fundamental property of polytopes is that every ridge is contained in precisely two facets .",
