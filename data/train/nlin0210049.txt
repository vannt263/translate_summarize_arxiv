    "the presence of randomness in many natural processes is traditionally ascribed to the lack of perfect control on observations and experiments .",
    "then , usually,``disorder '' and `` irregular behaviors '' are considered only as unavoidable factors which , in phenomena modellizations , can be described effectively through external sources ( random numbers in computer simulations , noise in stochastic equations etc . ) .",
    "however randomness may also have another origin associated to local instabilities of the deterministic microscopic dynamics of a system , i.e. microscopic chaos ( mc ) .",
    "for instance , macroscopic diffusion of a particle in a fluid can be interpreted as a consequence of chaos on microscopic scales generated by collisions of the particle with the surrounding others .",
    "the possibility of describing the brownian behavior in terms of deterministic motion has stimulated a large amount of work in the field of deterministic diffusion to study purely deterministic systems exhibiting asymptotically a linear growth of the mean square displacement  @xcite .",
    "the deterministic interpretation of transport phenomena establishes a close connection between transport and chaos theory , and , at least in principle , macroscopic properties such as transport coefficients ( viscosity , thermal and electrical conductivity , diffusion etc . )",
    "could be directly computed through indicators of chaos @xcite or by applying the standard techniques of chaos theory such as periodic orbit expansion @xcite . however , considering randomness and transport in general as signatures of mc raises subtle and fundamental issues in statistical physics that have to be carefully discussed an investigated .",
    "first , there is the main problem of conceiving and realizing experiments able to prove , beyond any doubt , the existence of mc in real systems .",
    "an experiment in this direction was attempted in ref .  @xcite but the conclusions were object of criticism by many authors , as we discuss later . besides , for real systems , the definition of mc appears to be ambiguous .",
    "indeed , real systems involve a large number of degrees of freedom and their model description entails taking the thermodynamic limit but , in this limit , the concept of lyapunov exponent becomes metric dependent so not well established  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the large number of degrees of freedom poses severe limitations also in the applicability of standard techniques to distinguish between chaotic and stochastic signals  @xcite when data are extracted from real experiments .",
    "in fact , the noise - chaos distinction requires a extremely fine resolutions in the observations that is impossible to reach when one deals with systems with large dimensionality @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite summarized an ingenious experiment devised to infer the presence of chaos on microscopic scales . in the experiment the position of a brownian particle in a fluid was recorded at regular time intervals .",
    "the time series were processed by using the same techniques developed for detecting chaos from data analysis  @xcite .",
    "authors measured a positive lower bound for the kolmogorov - sinai entropy , claiming that this was an experimental evidence for the presence of microscopic chaos .",
    "however in the papers  @xcite and  @xcite it was argued that a similar result holds for a non - chaotic system too , hence the experiment can not provide a conclusive evidence neither for the existence of microscopic chaos nor for the relevance of chaotic behavior in diffusion phenomena .",
    "such papers shown that , through the analysis performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is no chance to observe differences in the diffusive behavior between a genuine deterministic chaotic systems as the 2-d lorentz gas with circular obstacles  @xcite and its non chaotic variant : the wind - tree ehrenfest model .",
    "the ehrenfest model consists of free moving independent particles ( wind ) that scatter against square obstacles ( trees ) randomly distributed in the plane but with fixed orientation . due to collisions ,",
    "particles undergo diffusion , however their motion can not be chaotic because a reflection by the flat planes of obstacles does not produce exponential trajectory separation ; the divergence is at most algebraic leading to zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "such considerations can be extended to squares obstacles with random orientations and to every polygonal scatterers , so there is a whole class of models where diffusion occurs in the absence of chaotic motion . a difference between the 2-@xmath1 chaotic and non - chaotic lorentz gas relies on the presence of periodic orbits  @xcite .",
    "the question that naturally arises `` what is the microscopic origin of the diffusive behavior ? '' remains still open . in this paper , focusing on this problem , we extend the analysis of dettman and cohen showing that standard diffusion may also occur in one - dimensional models where every chaotic effect is surely absent .",
    "these systems , being one - dimensional , can be much easily studied than wind - tree models without spoiling the essence of the problem .",
    "accurate results are obtained with relatively small computational efforts , and the interpretation of the results is clearer since we are able to better control and quantify the effects of the local instabilities .",
    "we shall see that , in such models , the relevant ingredients to obtain diffusion in the absence of deterministic chaos is the combined action of a `` finite size instability '' , quenched disorder and a quasi - periodic perturbation .",
    "where by `` finite size instability '' we mean that infinitesimal perturbations are stable , while perturbations of finite size can grow algebraically .",
    "the interplay between these three features guarantees the system to be still diffusive as it would be chaotic .",
    "this outcome is another striking effect of finite size instabilities which make the behaviors of certain non - chaotic system similar , to some extent , to those generated by genuine chaotic systems ( @xcite ) . in ref .  @xcite the reader can find a study of an interesting system with weak mixing properties and zero lyapunov exponent , i.e. an intermediate case between integrability and strong mixing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first recall the general features of @xmath0-@xmath1 models showing deterministic diffusion .",
    "then we present two non - chaotic , one - dimensional models that exhibit deterministic diffusion when properly perturbed . in section iii",
    "we characterize numerically the diffusion properties of the models and their dependence on the external perturbation .",
    "section iv shows how these models can be viewed as non - chaotic space - time billiards , and discusses in more detail the role of periodic orbits .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions and remarks .",
    "motivated by the problem of deterministic diffusion in non - chaotic lorentz systems ( i.e. with polygonal obstacles ) we introduce models that , somehow , represent their one - dimensional analog .",

    "this model has been so widely studied , both analytically and numerically @xcite that can be considered as a reference model for deterministic diffusion . the deterministic chaos which governs the evolution inside each unit cell is responsible of the irregular jumping between cells and the overall dynamics appears diffusive , in the sense that asymptotically the variance of @xmath3 scales linearly with time . following the literature on deterministic diffusion we consider systems with no net drift ( @xmath22 @xmath23 for @xmath24 ) . in this paper",
    "we will see that there is no need to invoke chaos to induce diffusive behavior in 1-@xmath1 maps , as already shown in @xcite in the context of 2-@xmath1 billiards .",
    "the construction of the models begins by dividing the first half of each unit cell @xmath25 into @xmath26 micro - intervals @xmath27 , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 . in each micro - interval",

    "figures  [ fig : map ] and [ fig : model2 ] show examples of these two models .",
    "let us note that the random variables @xmath42 and @xmath39 are quenched variables , i.e. in a given realization of a model they depend on the cell @xmath25 ( so one should properly write @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) but they do not depend on time .    as fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] illustrates in model ( [ model_1 ] ) each cell is partitioned in the same number @xmath26 of randomly chosen micro - intervals of mean size @xmath45 and in each of them the slope of the map ( microscopic slope ) is one . for @xmath46 ( equivalently @xmath47 )",
    "we recover the chaotic system  ( [ eq : chaos ] ) but the limit @xmath48 has to be carefully interpreted .",
    "this kind of modification of the original chaotic system is somehow equivalent to replacing circular by polygonal obstacles in the lorentz system @xcite , since the steps with unitary slope are the analogous of the flat boundaries of the obstacles .",
    "the discontinuities of @xmath49 produce a dispersion of trajectories in a way similar to that of a vertex of polygons that splits a narrow beam of particles hitting on it .",
    "however , at variance with the @xmath50-@xmath1 wind - tree model , both randomness and forcing are needed to attain a full diffusive behavior .",
    "note that , thanks to the local preservation of the antisymmetry with respect to the cell center , no net drift is expected and also the sinai - golosov @xcite effect is absent . also model ( [ model_2 ] ) is non - chaotic and the randomness is introduced in the function but not in the partition of the unit cells .",
    "since @xmath49 has slope @xmath0 almost everywhere , the chaoticity condition i ) is no more satisfied in these models .",

    "even though by construction the system is not unstable in the lyapunov sense , it exhibits standard diffusion .",
    "in particular , numerical simulations show a linear growth of the mean square displacement .",
    "it is important to note that , for model  ( [ model_1 ] ) a uniform partition of cell domains plus the quasi - periodic perturbation is not sufficient to produce diffusive dynamics . even in the presence of quenched randomness (",
    "i.e. random partitions or random heights ) alone , the system spontaneously settles onto periodic or quasi - periodic trajectories and does not diffuse . the periodic and quasi - periodic behavior is broken down , only when a time dependent perturbation is explicitly superimposed onto the quenched randomness .",
    "hence , we can say that , in our models , the time plays somehow the role of the missing spatial dimension with respect to the @xmath50-@xmath1 models of ref .",

    "the onset of a diffusive regime as a threshold - like phenomenon , with respect to the external perturbation amplitude , is expected .",
    "it can be explained by noticing that , due to the staircase nature of the system , the perturbation has to exceed the typical discontinuity of @xmath49 , to activate the local instability which is the first step toward the diffusion .",
    "data collapsing in figs  [ fig : thres ] confirms this view , because it is achieved by plotting @xmath65 versus the scaling variable @xmath73 .",

    "the instability makes the variance growing exponentially at the rate @xmath86 $ ] which is its lyapunov exponent .",
    "this exponential separation lasts until the typical linear behavior of the diffusion takes place ( see fig .  [",

    "the crossover time @xmath100 between the regimes a ) and b ) depends on the size of the discontinuities of @xmath49 and the specific realization of the randomness and , of course , it decreases when either @xmath26 or @xmath101 increases .",
    "we stress that the above scenario is due to the presence of finite size instabilities that in a non chaotic lorentz gas would correspond to the defocusing mechanism of a beam by the vertices of polygonal obstacles .",
    "the onset of standard diffusive behavior in model  ( [ eq : nochaos ] ) depends on large - time features of the deterministic dynamics .",
    "indeed the presence of periodic trajectories , standing or running @xcite , have a strong influence on the diffusion , because the formers tend to suppress diffusion while the latter induce a `` trivial '' ballistic behavior . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been conjectured that the main difference between a fully chaotic deterministic system and a non chaotic system exhibiting diffusion , as a consequence of quenched randomness , is in the different effects the periodic trajectories have on the systems .",
    "an escape rate method @xcite can be applied to analyze these effects .",
    "this method consists on starting with an ensemble of @xmath102 trajectories initially localized in the region @xmath103 between @xmath104 and @xmath105 and computing the number @xmath106 of them which never left @xmath107 until the time @xmath108 . for",

    "however possible deviations from ( [ eq : dacay ] ) generally indicate a non diffusive behavior related to the presence of periodic orbits .",

    "@xcite , we have considered a system were the same configuration of the disorder is repeated every @xmath118 cells ( _ i.e. _ @xmath119 ) , so the entropy for unit length is surely zero .",
    "this point is crucial , because , someone can argue that a deterministic infinite system with spatial randomness can be interpreted as an effective stochastic system , but this is a `` matter of taste '' .",

    "therefore , we can safely conclude that , even with a vanishing ( spatial ) entropy density of randomness , at least for sufficiently large @xmath118 , the system is able to effectively perform standard diffusion for a very long time .",

    "the disorder configuration is repeated every @xmath118 cells , and for small @xmath118 the recurrence time of an orbit ( i.e. the time to return to the same microinterval , module @xmath118 ) decreases . since we are interested in the role of periodic orbits , here we consider the limit case @xmath162 .",
    "that is , in the simulations reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmdiffusion ] , the disorder configuration in the unit interval @xmath6 $ ] was copied to all the cells @xmath163 $ ] . as expected the figure shows the suppression of diffusion for rational frequencies",
    ". however , more interesting is the fact that there is a tendency for the onset of the suppression of diffusion to increase as @xmath155 approaches @xmath164 .",
    "this is related to the fact that for rationals with lower denominators the time period of the billiard is small , and the probability that the recurrence time of an orbit coincides with a multiple of the period of the billiard is high .",
    "the recurrence time is also related to the value of @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath26 is large , the probability for an initial condition to return to the same micro - interval ( module @xmath118 ) is small , and periodic orbits are more scarce .",
    "this explains why for large enough @xmath26 and @xmath118 , diffusion might not be suppressed even for rational frequencies with large denominators .",
    "this suggests that , for large enough @xmath26 and @xmath118 , deviations from diffusion are unlikely to be observed numerically in the case of rational frequencies with large denominators .",

    "the heights of map are uniformely distributed in @xmath6 $ ] ( @xmath165 see text ) . ]",
    "from the above results we can conclude that two basic ingredients are relevant for diffusion , 1 ) a finite size instability mechanism : in the chaotic system this is given by the lyapunov instability , in the `` stepwise '' system this effect stems from the jumps 2 ) a mechanism to suppress periodic orbits and therefore to allow for a diffusion at large scales . in the presence of `` strong chaos '' ( i.e. when all the periodic orbits are unstable ) point 2 )",
    "is automatically guaranteed thus the periodic orbits formalism @xcite can be fully applied to compute the diffusion coefficient . in non chaotic systems , however , like the present one , the mechanism 2 ) is the result of a combined effect of quenched randomness and quasi - periodic forcing .    in summary ,",
    "we have introduced and studied models exhibiting diffusion in the absence of any source of chaotic behavior .",
    "the models represent the @xmath0-@xmath1 analogue of non chaotic lorentz gas ( i.e. with polygonal obstacles ) discussed by other authors in connection with the debate around experimental evidences for a distinction between chaotic and stochastic diffusion .",
    "our results indicate that when the chaotic instability condition ( positive lyapunov exponent ) is replaced by the presence of finite size instability ( non positive lyapunov exponent ) we need both an external quasi - periodic perturbation and disorder for preventing the system falling into either a periodic / quasi - periodic evolution or a drift dominated behavior .",
    "we believe that this kind of behaviour is rather general , in the sense that chaos does not seem to be a necessary condition for the validity of some statistical features .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent results of ref .",
