    "<S> we account for the different symmetries of the @xmath0 helium excited states in a quasiclassical description of the knockout mechanism augmented by a quantum shakeoff contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus able to formulate the separate contribution of the knockout and shakeoff mechanisms for double photoionization for _ any _ excess energy from the @xmath0 states . </S>",
    "<S> photoionization ratios and singly differential cross sections calculated for the @xmath0 excited states of helium are found to be in very good agreement with recent theoretical results .    a two electron transition in an atom after the absorption of a single photon is only possible due to electron - electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the study of two electron transitions in helium , the simplest atomic target with two electrons , probes the role of electron - electron correlations in their purest form . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , there has been an extensive amount of experimental and theoretical studies of double photoionization from the ground state of the helium atom .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the role of electron - electron correlations , the study of two electron escape by a single photon absorption from the singlet , @xmath1 , and triplet , @xmath2 , excited states of helium probes the role of symmetry in the two electron dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly important for quasiclassical approximations where symmetries and quantum interferences are difficult to include . with the exception of a few earlier studies in the high energy limit @xcite , it is only recently that the study of double photoionization from the @xmath0 excited states of helium has attracted considerable theoretical interest . </S>",
    "<S> experimental measurements of photon absorption cross sections from the helium excited states still remain a challenge . in these recent studies sophisticated fully numerical ab - initio methods namely the r - matrix method @xcite and the convergent close - coupling method @xcite </S>",
    "<S> are used to compute integral double ionization cross sections , double to single ratios , and only very recently , single and triple differential cross sections as well @xcite . however , due to the numerical nature of these sophisticated ab - initio calculations approximate methods are also essential in uncovering the underlying mechanism of the two electron dynamics in the double escape process . </S>",
    "<S> such approximate methods have been successfully developed for the double photoionization from the helium ground state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the current work focuses on an approximate method to describe double photoionization from the helium excited states .    in the double photoionization process </S>",
    "<S> the redistribution of the energy , following the photon absorption , is often discussed in terms of two mechanisms , that is , knockout and shakeoff dominant in the low and high energy limit , respectively . in the knockout mechanism </S>",
    "<S> one electron , the primary , absorbs the photon and undergoes a hard collision with the secondary electron , thus , knocking it out of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> the knockout mechanism dominates at low energies where the interaction time of the two electrons is large and can be described classically @xcite . for knockout , </S>",
    "<S> electron correlations are essential in the final continuum state . on the other hand , in the shakeoff mechanism </S>",
    "<S> the primary electron absorbs the photon and leaves the atom very fast without undergoing a direct interaction with the secondary electron . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary electron feels the sudden change in the atomic field and relaxes in one of the bound or continuum eigenstates of the remaining ion . </S>",
    "<S> the shakeoff mechanism is quantum mechanical in nature and prevails at high energies where the interaction time of the two electrons is short . for shakeoff , </S>",
    "<S> electron correlations are important in the initial state before the photon is absorbed .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the explicit but separate contribution of both mechanisms for double photoionization from the @xmath0 helium excited states for _ any _ excess energy by extending the model developed to separate the contribution of both mechanisms for the helium ground state in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the separation is achieved by a _ </S>",
    "<S> quasiclassical _ formulation of the knockout process . by construction </S>",
    "<S> it is free from any shakeoff contribution which is purely _ </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanical_. this separation not only facilitates the calculation of double photoionization but offers considerable insight into the process concerning for example the similarity with electron impact ionization of @xmath3 . compared to the ground state , formulating the separate contribution of both mechanisms from the helium excited states is a much harder problem since the different symmetry of the @xmath0 states has to be accounted for in the model .    </S>",
    "<S> we express the two steps of the double photoionization process from the helium excited states , absorption of the photon and afterwards redistribution of the energy , as @xmath4 where x stands for either knockout or shakeoff and @xmath5 is the double electron ionization probability . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how to obtain @xmath6 and then @xmath7 for the @xmath0 helium states .    </S>",
    "<S> -_knockout mechanism_- after the photon absorption by the primary electron , we describe the subsequent evolution of the two electrons using the classical - trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) phase space method . ctmc has been successfully used to describe charged particle impact processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we model the initial phase space of the trajectories quantum mechanically using a wigner distribution @xcite . to do so , we first find the initial two - electron wavefunction . since electron correlations are not important in the initial state of the knockout mechanism , we choose our initial state as the independent electron wavefunction @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are hydrogenic @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals with effective charges @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 given by eq.([eq : wavefunction ] ) is not a symmetrized wavefunction , thus , we do not yet account for the different symmetries of the triplet @xmath2 and the singlet @xmath1 helium excited states . to find the effective charges @xmath13 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 we use the two - electron ionization energies @xmath16 for the @xmath17 states given in ref.@xcite , and the ionization energies of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 orbitals as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the energy needed to remove the @xmath11 electron after the @xmath12 electron has been ionized is @xmath18 a.u . and </S>",
    "<S> thus from @xmath19 we find @xmath20 for both the triplet and the singlet states . </S>",
    "<S> from @xmath21 we find @xmath22 for the @xmath17 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> atomic units are used throughout this paper unless otherwise indicated .    while , for the @xmath23 helium ground state the photon is necessarily absorbed by a @xmath11 electron , for the @xmath24 configuration of the @xmath0 helium states the photon can be absorbed by a @xmath11 or a @xmath12 electron . for the values of the effective charges given above </S>",
    "<S> , one can show that the cross section is much larger for photon absorption from a @xmath11 electron rather than a @xmath12 electron using the independent electron picture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we take the primary electron to be the one on the @xmath11 orbital . with the peak approximation , exact in the high photon energy limit @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the photon absorption happens directly at the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this significantly reduces the initial phase space to be sampled by the ctmc method .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial phase space distribution , @xmath25 , is the two electron density immediately after the photon absorption given by @xmath26 where n is a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> the initial distribution of the primary electron is @xmath27 ( peak approximation ) while that of the secondary electron is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the wigner distribution function of the two electron wavefunction with the primary electron at the nucleus , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in eq.([eq : distribution2 ] ) , we take the energy of the secondary electron immediately after photon absorption , @xmath32 , to be fixed on the @xmath12 energy shell @xmath33 . from eq.([eq : wavefunction ] ) , it follows that @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the excess energy available to the two electron system after photon absorption is determined by the photon energy to be @xmath35 for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> due to the peak approximation the primary electron can have any energy necessary so that together with the initial energy @xmath32 of the secondary electron it adds up to the excess energy e in eq.([energy ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> after modelling the initial phase space distribution , we propagate the electron trajectories using the classical equations of motion ( ctmc ) . regularized coordinates @xcite are used for the propagation of the electron trajectories to avoid problems with trajectories starting at the nucleus ( @xmath30 ) . doubly ionized are those trajectories that end with the asymptotic energies of both electrons being positive . to evaluate the double electron escape probability each trajectory </S>",
    "<S> is weighted by the initial phase space wigner distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have treated the two electrons as distinguishable particles , that is , we distinguish between the primary and the secondary electron . to account for the singlet and triplet symmetries we have to symmetrize the probability _ amplitude _ ( differential probability ) @xmath36 with respect to the two identical particles , @xmath37 in eq.([eq : amplitude ] ) , @xmath38 is the probability for both electrons to escape when the primary electron is ejected with energy @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , and the secondary electron is ejected with energy @xmath41 . to evaluate @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> we divide the energy interval @xmath42 $ ] into n equally sized bins and find the doubly ionized trajectories which fall into the bins . </S>",
    "<S> in our calculations we take @xmath43 for excess energies up to @xmath44 ev and @xmath45 for higher excess energies . </S>",
    "<S> the double ionization probability @xmath6 is obtained by integrating over all possible energies that an electron can be ejected with , that is @xmath46 note that for the case of the helium ground state the double ionization probability @xmath6 is worked out without using the differential probabilities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> -_shakeoff mechanism_- assuming that the primary electron is suddenly removed from the atom , aberg @xcite found that the probability for the shaken ( secondary ) electron to relax on a hydrogenic eigenstate of the remaining ion for _ any _ excess energy is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the primary electron wavefunction after it has left the atom . </S>",
    "<S> the primary electron is in an @xmath50 state before the photon absorption and in a @xmath51 state afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the initial state wavefuntion of the @xmath0 helium excited states and @xmath52 is a hydrogenic eigenstate of the bare nucleus ( @xmath53 ) that is either a bound ( @xmath54 ) or a continuum state ( @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> aberg @xcite has further shown that when the primary electron leaves the atom with very high energy ( @xmath56 ) eq.([eq : shakeoff ] ) takes the simplified form    @xmath57    eq.([eq : shakeoff1 ] ) reveals the quantum mechanical nature of the shakeoff process since it is expressed as an overlap of the initial bound state wavefunction and the final continuum state wavefunction .    </S>",
    "<S> although eq.([eq : shakeoff1 ] ) was derived in the high energy limit we assume that the primary electron absorbs the photon on the nucleus for all excess energies , that is , we adopt the peak approximation as in the knockout case . to find the double escape probability @xmath7 we then integrate over all possible energies of the shaken electron in the continuum    @xmath58    we further simplify the evaluation of the shakeoff probability in eqs.([eq : shakeoff1 ] ) , ( [ eq : shakeoff2 ] ) by taking the initial state to be the symmetrized wavefunction @xmath59 for the singlet and triplet states , respectively , with @xmath60 a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state correlations are accounted for only through the effective charges . </S>",
    "<S> we next assign the same set of effective charges @xmath61 and @xmath62 for both the triplet and the singlet states as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic ratio ( high energy limit ) of double to single ionization is found very accurately in ref.@xcite to be @xmath63 for the singlet / triplet states where in our model @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 using eqs.([eq : r ] ) , ( [ eq : shakeoff4 ] ) and the symmetrized wavefunctions in eq.([eq : wavefunction1 ] ) we find the sets of charges that match both asymptotic ratios @xmath64 for the singlet and the triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> we then select that set of charges for which the shakeoff double ionization probability as a function of the excess energy , obtained using the simple wavefunctions given in eq.([eq : wavefunction1 ] ) , is closest to the one obtained using the fully correlated hylleraas wavefunctions given in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the set of charges thus found is @xmath67 and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason we do not use the hylleraas wavefunctions given in ref.@xcite is that they do not reproduce the accurate asymptotic ratios obtained in ref.@xcite using highly accurate pekeris - type wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise though that one does not need to use the approximate wavefunctions in eq.([eq : wavefunction1 ] ) to compute the double ionization probability ; highly accurate wavefunctions that reproduce the correct asymptotic ratios could be used instead .    for the shakeoff probability , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 in eq.([eq : shakeoff1 ] ) already gives the differential double ionization probability . despite the symmetrization in eq.([eq : wavefunction1 ] ) we have lost the indistinguishability of the electrons by identifying one electron as the primary one which absorbs the photon . </S>",
    "<S> thus we need to symmetrize again in the final state with respect to the equal energy sharing point @xmath70 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath71    -_photoionization ratios_- . according to eq.([eq : crosssection ] ) @xmath72 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the double to single ionization ratio is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> in figure ( [ fig : total ] ) we compare the double to single ratio for the @xmath0 helium excited states with the results obtained by kheifets _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite using the convergent close - coupling method and show that there is a very good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is better for the @xmath2 state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the deviation occurs , particularly for the @xmath2 state , at photon energies where the contribution of knockout and shakeoff mechanisms is comparable . at these energies </S>",
    "<S> any interference effect between the knockout and shakeoff mechanism would have its largest effect . </S>",
    "<S> so , it may be that the deviations we see are due to that interference effect that we do not account for in our calculation , since we add the knockout and shakeoff contributions incoherently . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath1 state a maximum of @xmath76 2.84 % is reached at @xmath77 ev above the double ionization threshold of the @xmath1 state . for the @xmath2 state a maximum of @xmath76 0.69 % is reached at @xmath78 ev above the ionization threshold of the @xmath2 state . in figure ( [ fig : total ] ) we see that at high energies the knockout contribution goes to zero as expected and the shakeoff contribution dominates and reaches the asymptotic limit of @xmath79 for the singlet / triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> stronger correlation effects for the singlet symmetry ( @xmath80 is not forbidden as is the case for the triplet ) result in a much higher double to single ionization ratio compared to the triplet case . from figure ( [ fig : total ] ) , for the @xmath0 states , and ref.@xcite , for the helium ground state @xmath81 , we see that as we go from @xmath82 the shakeoff mechanism overtakes the knockout mechanism at smaller energies . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the electron - electron correlation becomes smaller , thus diminishing the knockout contribution and favouring the shakeoff mechanism at even smaller energies .    </S>",
    "<S> -_single differentials_- to compute the single differential probabilities for the helium excited states we use @xmath83 in addition we compute the single differential cross sections using @xmath84 where for @xmath85 we use the results for the total - photoionization cross section for the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 states given in ref.@xcite . in figure ( [ fig : differential ] ) we compare our results for @xmath86 with the results obtained very recently by colgan _ et al _ @xcite using the convergent close - coupling method for four values of the excess energy . </S>",
    "<S> we see that our results for the single differential cross section as a function of the ejected electron energy normalized by the excess energy are smaller for the @xmath1 state while there is an excellent agreement for the @xmath2 state . </S>",
    "<S> again as we go from @xmath82 the single differential cross sections are more u - shaped for the same excess energy . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is again that the electron - electron correlation decreases thus favouring the ejection of one fast and one slow electron , that is favouring unequal energy sharing .    in figure ( [ fig : koso ] ) we show the separate contribution of knockout and shakeoff to the single differential probabilities for the @xmath0 helium states for excess energies @xmath87 ev , @xmath88 ev and @xmath89 ev . for the singlet state the knockout contribution dominates at small excess energies , @xmath87 ev and @xmath88 ev , while as the excess energy is increased to @xmath89 ev the shakeoff contribution begins to dominate regions of unequal energy sharing . for the triplet case </S>",
    "<S> the shakeoff mechanism is already significant at small excess energies . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the knockout contribution for the triplet case is zero at the equal energy sharing point , @xmath90 , because of the symmetrization with respect to the two identical electrons , see eq.([eq : amplitude ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that the double ionization from the @xmath0 states can be accurately described by a separate formulation and calculation of the knockout and shakeoff mechanism at any excess energy . in comparison to the helium ground state @xcite </S>",
    "<S> this is a harder problem because we have to account for the different symmetries of the singlet and triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> the success of this simple model to describe double ionization from the helium ground state as well as the helium excited states is proof for its validity . in the future </S>",
    "<S> , we plan to use this simple model to describe triple photoionization cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> the authors wish to thank t. pattard for helpful discussions . </S>"
