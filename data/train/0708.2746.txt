    "low dimensional quantum magnets@xcite which display collective singlet ground states are very topical , due to the exotic low temperature properties they display , as well as their relation to high temperature superconductivity@xcite .",
    "quasi - two dimensional s=1/2 systems such as the shastry - sutherland system srcu@xmath6(bo@xmath2)@xmath6 exist@xcite , wherein orthogonal cu@xmath7 dimers are arranged on a square lattice .",
    "this material displays a collective singlet ground state , relatively dispersionless triplet excitations and multiple triplet bound excited states .",
    "quasi - one dimensional quantum magnets are more common , with s=1/2 chains based on organic molecules , such as ttf - cubdt@xcite and mem-(tcnq)@xmath6@xcite , based on cu@xmath7 ( 3d@xmath8 ) , such as cugeo@xmath2@xcite , and most recently based on ti@xmath7(3d@xmath9 ) , such as tiocl@xcite and tiobr@xcite .",
    "these materials undergo spin - peierls phase transitions to a singlet ground state as the temperature is lowered .",
    "related phenomena occurs in quasi - one dimensional quantum magnets with s=1 chains , such as nenp and csnicl@xmath2 @xcite , which enter a haldane singlet phase at low temperatures .",
    "cugeo@xmath2 was the first inorganic spin - peierls system to be discovered .",
    "the singlet ground state associated with cugeo@xmath2 below its spin - peierls phase transition of t@xmath10@xmath11 14.1 k has been well studied@xcite .",
    "such a system is characterized by uniform chains of s=1/2 moments at high temperatures , which dimerise at low temperature to allow singlets to form .",
    "this phase transition breaks translational symmetry , and a singlet - triplet gap is introduced into its magnetic excitation spectrum at its magnetic zone centre .",
    "it possesses a much higher magnetic moment density than the pre - existing organic spin - peierls systems@xcite , and it can be grown in large single crystal form by several different growth techniques .",
    "this has enabled detailed neutron scattering studies of the spin - peierls ground state and its excitations@xcite .",
    "cugeo@xmath2 can also be grown in the presence of impurities , and studies of doped - cugeo@xmath2 have revealed the sensitivity of the spin - peierls ground state to different types of impurities@xcite . in particular they have revealed a remarkably rich temperature - impurity concentration phase diagram in which antiferromagnetic long range order coexists with either a dimerised or uniform structure at sufficiently low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this occurs for both non - magnetic zn@xmath7@xciteand mg@xmath7@xcite substituting for cu@xmath7 , as well as for si@xmath12@xcite substituting for ge@xmath12 .",
    "most of the work on impurities in cugeo@xmath2 has employed dopants which possess a similar or a smaller ionic radius than that of the host ion which they seek to replace . zn@xmath7 ,",
    "mg@xmath7 , and cu@xmath7 have ionic radii of 0.74 @xmath13 , 0.66 @xmath13 , and 0.72 @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "however , some work has also been done on low concentration substitution@xcite of cu@xmath7 with cd@xmath7 , whose ionic radius is much bigger , 0.97 @xmath13 , than that of cu@xmath7 .",
    "the difference in ionic radii severely limits the solubility of cd in cugeo@xmath2 ; nonetheless small single crystals of cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2with x @xmath14 0.002 were grown and studied@xcite .",
    "this previous study@xcite , on small single crystals grown from a flux , showed little change in t@xmath10 , and no coexisting antiferromagnetism at the low cd concentrations and base temperature that could be achieved .",
    "however , interestingly , the critical properties of the spin peierls phase transition changed from three dimensional universality to mean field behaviour on doping with cd .",
    "one interesting dimension of the spin - peierls problem is the relation between the singlet - triplet gap in the spin excitation spectrum , and the order parameter for dimerisation .",
    "cross and fisher@xcite originally argued for the power law relation @xmath15(t ) @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ( t))@xmath17 with @xmath18=2/3 .",
    "the discovery of the spin - peierls state in cugeo@xmath2 has allowed this relationship to be tested directly using inelastic and elastic neutron scattering to measure the temperature dependence of the gap energy , @xmath15(t ) , and the square of the order parameter for the spin - peierls dimerisation @xmath19 .",
    "we report here inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the temperature dependence of the magnetic excitation spectrum at the magnetic zone centre , and of the x - ray diffraction measurements of the superlattice bragg peak intensity , in a new single crystal of lightly doped cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2(x",
    "@xmath14 0.002 ) .",
    "these results show that the simple power law relation between the gap and the dimerisation order parameter is not obeyed , and that a finite triplet gap exists at the spin - peierls phase transition itself .",
    "a single crystal of cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2with x @xmath14 0.002 was grown by the self - flux method in a floating zone image furnace .",
    "the crystal was grown at a rate of @xmath11 5 - 8 mm / hour with an oxygen pressure of 47 kpa .",
    "earlier experience@xcite on flux - grown cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2indicated a low solubility of cd in the cugeo@xmath2host .",
    "for that reason , naturally occurring cd was used in the crystal growth , even though the crystals were intended for neutron scattering studies , and cd has a high neutron absorption cross section .",
    "initial neutron diffraction measurements on the sample showed strong bragg scattering , from a high quality crystal that was single throughout its volume .",
    "its approximate dimensions were of 30 mm long by 5 mm in diameter , and mosaic spread was less than 0.4 degree .",
    "these measurements confirmed that the crystal was orthorhombic with lattice parameters within error the same as the pure material ; _ _ a__= 4.81 , _ _",
    "b__= 8.47 and _ _",
    "c__= 2.94 at 4k .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements were performed on a small single crystal cut from the large crystal used in the neutron scattering measurements .",
    "the crystal was mounted on the cold finger of a closed cycle refridgerator and aligned within a huber four circle goniometer .",
    "the measurements with a rotating anode cu - k@xmath20 x - ray source and a pyrolitic graphite monochromator were performed at temperatures from 6.5 k to 14.5 k with a temperature stability of @xmath11 0.005 k. the primary purpose of these measurements was to precisely study the critical properties of the spin - peierls order parameter , as measured by the temperature dependence of the * q*=(@xmath21,5,-@xmath21 ) superlattice bragg peak intensity , and to determine the critical exponent , @xmath22 .",
    "another small piece of crystal was cut off and used for magnetic characterization with squid magnetometry .",
    "the characteristic falloff of the dc susceptibility signifying t@xmath10 near 14.1 k was observed .",
    "figure 1 shows the comparison of the normalised susceptibility measurement for both cugeo@xmath2and cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2samples as a function of temperature .",
    "it is clear from this data that the susceptibility of the doped sample is very similar to that of the pure material . at temperatures above t@xmath10 ,",
    "the susceptibility of both samples show a broad maximum characteristic of short range , quasi - one - dimensional correlations . below 10",
    "k the cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2susceptibility is @xmath11 20@xmath23 larger than that of the cugeo@xmath2sample , indicating that cd impurities are indeed present in the system .",
    "they have the effect of freeing - up individual spins near the impurities , thereby increasing the susceptibility .",
    "elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed on the large single crystal of cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2at the canadian neutron beam centre , chalk river , using the n5 triple axis spectrometer .",
    "the crystal was mounted in a @xmath24he cryostat with its ( 0,k , l ) plane coincident with the horizontal scattering plane , such that wavevectors near the * q*=(0,1,@xmath21 ) magnetic zone centre could be accessed .",
    "the measurements were made with pyrolytic graphite as both monochromator and analyser crystals , a fixed final neutron energy of 14.7 mev , and with two pyrolytic graphite filters in the scattered beam to reduce higher order contamination .",
    "soller slits determined the horizontal collimation and the resulting horizontal and vertical divergences of the beam were [ 38,36,36,212 ] and [ 58,73,146,636 ] respectively , in minutes of arc , using the convention [ source - monochromator , monochromator - sample , sample - analyser , analyser - detector ] .",
    "elastic neutron scattering measurements were performed at the magnetic zone centre , * q*=(0,1,@xmath21 ) , to search for impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering at t=0.32 k. no evidence for magnetic ordering was found .",
    "the lack of change in t@xmath10 in cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2as compared with cugeo@xmath2 , as well as the absence of magnetic order at t=0.32 k , can be used to set an upper limit for the cd concentration in the single crystal sample of cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2 . assuming that the cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 phase diagram@xcite is applicable to cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2 , at least at low doping concentrations , an upper limit of x @xmath25 0.002 can be set .",
    "we measured the temperature dependence of the @xmath26=(@xmath21,5,-@xmath21 ) superlattice bragg peak intensity , as shown in figure 2 for temperatures close to t@xmath10 .",
    "this peak arises from the dimerisation pattern within the spin - peierls state in cugeo@xmath2 , and its amplitude is proportional to the square of the order parameter .    as was done previously to examine the critical properties of doped cugeo@xmath2@xcite , this peak intensity as a function of temperature was fit to a modified power law as shown in equation 1 .",
    "this modified power law includes a correction to scaling term@xcite , with the correction to scaling exponent @xmath27 set to its expected value of 0.5 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29    the solid line in figure 2 shows the fit of equation 1 to the data and clearly this expression describes the data very well for temperatures close to t@xmath10 .",
    "the fit gives t@xmath10 = 14.15 @xmath30 k and a critical exponent @xmath31 .",
    "this value is close to the mean - field value of @xmath32 , and is much larger than the values for @xmath33 from three dimensional universality @xcite that are known to characterize both pure cugeo@xmath2@xcite and lightly doped cugeo@xmath2 in which the dopants possess similar ionic radii to the host ions they replace@xcite .",
    "this mean field result is similar to that found by lumsden et al.@xcite in which the critical behaviour of lightly doped single crystals of cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2grown by the flux method also showed mean field critical exponent @xmath22 values .",
    "these results establish that some cd impurities are present in the crystal , and also provide a quantitative form for the spin - peierls order parameter as a function of temperature , which can then be compared to the temperature dependence of the triplet gap in the excitation spectrum obtained from inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "constant-*q * inelastic neutron scattering scans were performed at the magnetic ordering wavevector * q@xmath34*=(0,1,@xmath21 ) in order to observe the temperature dependence of the triplet excitations at the magnetic zone centre .",
    "the energies of the triplet excitations disperse with wavevector due to the three dimensional nature of the magnetic system . near the ordering wavevector",
    ", this dispersion@xcite varies with the relative wave vector * * q**=*q*-**q**@xmath34 , as :    @xmath35    where @xmath15 is the minimum triplet excitation energy or gap energy .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are reduced wave vectors expressed in r.l.u . where : + @xmath39 and @xmath40    @xmath41 and @xmath42    @xmath43 and @xmath44 +    representative data at 4 k and 21 k , well below and well above t@xmath10 respectively , are shown in figure 3 , and the low temperature singlet - triplet gap of @xmath15 @xmath11 2 mev is identified in the 4 k data . at 21 k ,",
    "the triplet excitation is completely absent and the finite energy peak in the inelastic scattering has been replaced with a weak continuum of scattering from quasi - elastic energies , out to the end of the scan , 4.8 mev .",
    "we note that the triplet excitation at low temperatures exhibits an asymmetric tail to the high energy side .",
    "figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the quasi - elastic scattering at @xmath5=0.41 mev and at @xmath26=(0,1,@xmath21 ) .",
    "it shows a  critical \" regime which extends from @xmath11 12 k to @xmath11 21 k within which quasi - elastic scattering is significantly - enhanced compared with either lower or higher temperatures .",
    "we wish to isolate the triplet excitation at @xmath45=(0,1,@xmath21 ) , from the incoherent elastic scattering as well as from the background scattering , and thereby determine the gap energy , @xmath15 , as a function of temperature .",
    "this requires a background subtraction for which we have two options .",
    "we can use the low temperature scattering at t=4 k - suitably modified to exclude the resolution - limited triplet excitation , or we can use the scattering at 21 k. each of these has advantages . for",
    "data the triplet excitation is sharp in energy , and so can be cleanly separated from the remaining scattering , comprised of incoherent elastic scattering from the sample , and energy - independent background scattering from fast neutrons .",
    "however the use of the t=4 k data set as a background does not recognise that inelastic scattering persists above t@xmath10 , albeit in the form of a weak , quasi - elastic spin excitation spectrum for which the t=21 k data set is characteristic . in what follows ,",
    "we employ both a suitably modified t=4 k data set ( lt background ) as well as the t=21 k data set ( ht background ) as the background data set to be subtracted from the signal so as to accurately estimate the scattering from the triplet excitation alone .",
    "this will allow us to examine the sensitivity of the gap , @xmath46 , to the method of background scattering estimation .",
    "figure 5 shows representative constant-*q * scans at ( 0,1,@xmath21 ) , for which a high or low temperature data sets have been subtracted from the scans at temperatures ranging from @xmath11 0.7 t@xmath10 ( 10 k ) to @xmath11 1.1 t@xmath10 ( 15 k ) .",
    "this data was fit to two different forms for s(*q * , @xmath4 ) with the intention of determining the temperature dependence of the gap energy , @xmath15 , and the inverse lifetime , @xmath47 of the triplet excitations .",
    "however a qualitative examination of the data in figure 5 shows a substantial , well defined inelastic peak to exist at @xmath11 1.6 mev or @xmath11 1.8 mev and t=13.83 k @xmath11 0.98 t@xmath10 , depending on whether the low temperature ( lt ) or high temperature ( ht ) data set is used as a background .",
    "one would qualitatively conclude therefore that the gap remains finite at t@xmath10 in this sample of cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2 , a result that is borne out by a quantitative analysis of the excitation spectrum , discussed below .",
    "the inelastic spectra , shown in figure 5 , were fit to two models of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) , each of which was convolved with the four - dimensional instrumental resolution function .",
    "the finite resolution of the measurement combines with the dispersion of the triplet excitations to higher energies at wavevectors away from the magnetic zone centre , equation 2 , and results in the asymmetry of the triplet lineshape , with a high energy tail .",
    "this is accounted for within our resolution convolution , where we employed the spin wave velocities ( see equation 2 ) determined previously@xcite .",
    "the first lorentzian model was employed by regnault et al@xcite , in their analysis of the temperature dependence of the triplet excitation energy near the magnetic zone centre in pure cugeo@xmath2 .",
    "the lorentzian ( lor ) profile is given by :    @xmath48\\ ] ]    the second model was a damped harmonic oscillator ( dho ) given by :    @xmath49\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the static susceptibility at * q*. for small damping , the relation between the gap energy in the dho and lor models is :    @xmath51    the results of fitting the data to the lor model and the dho model are shown as the solid and dashed lines in figure 5 .",
    "both models are reasonable descriptors of the data . however , the dho model is a better descriptor as its goodness - of - fit parameter , @xmath52 , is typically 10 to 40@xmath23 lower than for the lor model at all temperatures .",
    "this is because the lor spectrum , used earlier @xcite , falls off too slowly with @xmath4 ; indeed its integral in frequency is divergent .",
    "we conclude that the inelastic scattering is best described using the dho form for s(*q * , @xmath4 ) , equation 4 .",
    "the values of the gap energy , @xmath15 , and inverse lifetime , @xmath47 , of the triplet excitations extracted from this analysis are plotted as a function of temperature in figure 6 .",
    "the top panel shows the parameters resulting from an analysis of the data using the ht background , while the bottom panel shows the parameters relevant to the lt background . as can be seen from figure 6 , while the background data set used",
    "influences the details of the fit parameters , it does not affect the overall trends and general features of the temperature dependence of the gap and inverse lifetime of the triplet excitations .",
    "our analysis , employing two different forms of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) and two different background subtractions , results in four forms of the gap energy , @xmath15 , and inverse lifetime , @xmath47 , as a function of temperature , which can then be compared with theoretical expectations . these are plotted as a function of temperature in figure 6 , where the top panel shows the parameters arising from use of the ht background , and the bottom panel shows those arising from use of the lt background . as can be seen the gap energy , @xmath53 2 mev at 4 k , is independent of both the form of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) and the details of the background , provided the lifetime of the triplets is sufficiently long , as it is below t@xmath11 10 k. above @xmath11 10 k , differences between the fitted gap energies progressively increase as the energy width of the excitations , and hence the inverse lifetimes , become larger . however in all four gap vs temperature plots shown in figure 6 , the gap energy , @xmath15 , does not appear to go to zero at t@xmath54 14.15 k. rather the phase transition occurs where the gap energy , @xmath15 , and the energy width or inverse lifetime of the excitation , @xmath47 , cross .",
    "figure 7 shows the gap energy , @xmath15 , plotted as a function of the spin - peierls order parameter as determined from the x - ray scattering determination of the temperature dependence of the superlattice bragg peak intensity shown in figure 2 .",
    "this net intensity is proportional to the square of the order parameter , and consequently we have plotted the square root of the net intensity on the x - axis of figure 7 . for reference",
    ", an x - axis label has been added to the top of figure 7 to denote the actual temperature .",
    "the top panel of figure 7 shows the analysis using the dho form of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) , while the bottom panel shows that using the lorentzian form .",
    "the systematic dependence of the gap on the form of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) and the details of the background can be seen in figures 6 and 7 . as t@xmath10 is approached , the dho form of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) produces a higher value of the gap energy as compared with the lorentzian form . for either form of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) , the use of the lt background results in a higher gap energy near @xmath55 , as compared to when the ht background is used .",
    "as previously discussed , theoretical expectations exist for the relation between the gap energy and the spin - peierls order parameter ; @xmath46@xmath11@xmath56@xmath57 with @xmath18=@xmath58 .",
    "this argument was originally made by cross and fisher@xcite in the context of the spin - peierls transition in ttf - cubdt@xcite .",
    "we have therefore fit the data shown in figure 7 to @xmath46@xmath59@xmath60+@xmath61@xmath57 , with @xmath60 a free parameter and also with @xmath60 set equal to zero . this latter case , with the gap going to zero at t@xmath10 , is consistent with the original theoretical expectation@xcite .",
    "the results of fitting our data to this expression are given in table 1 , for all four data sets ( dho and lor forms of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) , and both ht and lt backgrounds ) .",
    "as can be seen , the fits give a finite value of @xmath60 , the gap energy at t@xmath10 , unless it is constrained to be zero .",
    "only one of the four combinations of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) and background ( lor and ht background ) give behaviour which is roughly consistent with @xmath62@xmath11@xmath56@xmath57 with @xmath18=@xmath58 , and this case gives a finite gap at t@xmath10 of 0.34 @xmath63 0.02 mev .",
    "the fits using the dho form of s(*q * , @xmath4 ) , which allows for the better quality description of the inelastic neutron scattering spectra , give either very low values of the exponent @xmath18 , or non - zero values of the gap at t@xmath10 ranging from @xmath11 0.4 to 0.75 @xmath64 the zero temperature value of the gap .",
    "we therefore conclude that the predicted relation @xmath46@xmath11@xmath61@xmath57 with @xmath18=@xmath58 is not obeyed in cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2 , and that the gap is finite at t@xmath10 .",
    "a question arises as to what role doping plays in this behaviour ?",
    "systematic studies of the cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 have shown a  pseudogap \" temperature regime to exist above t@xmath10 for the low dopant concentrations which allow a spin - peierls transition to occur@xcite .",
    "this temperature regime is bordered from below by the appearance of long range spin - peierls order , and from above by signatures indicative of the presence of a gap , such as a suppression in the susceptibility .",
    "this pseudogap regime broadens in temperature with increasing doping until the spin - peierls state is lost altogether beyond x@xmath11 0.03 in cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 .",
    "the low doping level present in the cu@xmath0cd@xmath1geo@xmath2sample studied here , and the observation of pseudogap - like behaviour in cu@xmath0mg@xmath1geo@xmath2 , suggest that the finite gap at t@xmath10 may be intrinsic to pure cugeo@xmath2 as well .",
    "surprisingly , in a previous study@xcite the temperature dependence of @xmath46 for pure cugeo@xmath2 was found to be consistent with @xmath46@xmath11@xmath56@xmath57 with @xmath18=@xmath58 .",
    "however these earlier measurements focused on the triplet excitations at a wavevector slightly displaced from the dimerization zone centre , and employed the less satisfactory lorentzian form for s(*q * , @xmath4 ) only .",
    "it may be of interest to revisit this problem in pure cugeo@xmath2 .",
    "it is notable that pseudo - gap behaviour has also been observed in the unconventional spin - peierls material tiocl@xcite .",
    "this material exhibits both a low temperature dimerization into a singlet ground state below t@xmath65 and an intermediate temperature phase characterized by an incommensurate structural distortion . above this phase transition ,",
    "a uniform phase exists which displays characteristics of a finite gap and the nmr signature for this pseudogap is maintained to @xmath11 1.3 t@xmath66@xcite .",
