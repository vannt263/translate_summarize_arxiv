    "problems with exponential diffusivity arise commonly in the study of water transport in variably - saturated porous media such as soil , rock or building materials  @xcite .",
    "an example of such , expressed in dimensionless form , is the one - dimensional nonlinear diffusion problem    [ eq : diffusion ] @xmath5 where the solution @xmath6 is called _ saturation _ and represents the volume fraction of pore space occupied by liquid .",
    "we are concerned here with the case when the dimensionless variable @xmath7 and the diffusivity is an _ exponential function _ of the solution having the form @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath4 are constants satisfying @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is a reasonable model for horizontal infiltration problems such as that pictured in figure  [ fig : geometry]a , where liquid is taken up by capillary action within a dry porous medium and gravity can be neglected .",
    "many experimental studies of porous media have been performed in which an exponential diffusion ansatz provides a good fit with measured data , mostly in the context of water transport in soil and rock  @xcite , but also for other porous materials such as wood  @xcite , brick  @xcite or concrete  @xcite .",
    "exponential diffusion has also been identified in other transport phenomena as diverse as heat conduction  @xcite , optical lithography  @xcite , solvent transport in polymers  @xcite , and diffusion of impurities in oxides  @xcite .",
    "the significance of this type of diffusion coefficient is that if @xmath12 and if @xmath4 is even moderately large then @xmath13 varies rapidly with @xmath2 , thereby causing solutions of ( [ eq : diffusion - eqn ] ) to develop a steep interface , called a _ wetting front _ in the context of porous media flow , that is associated with localised high curvature and an exponential change in the solution gradient ( see figure  [ fig : geometry]b ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform an asymptotic analysis of this phenomenon and in particular to study self - similar solutions of ( [ eq : diffusion - eqn ] ) using a multi - layer asymptotic expansion , supported by numerical calculations .",
    "the asymptotic theory is especially subtle owing to the exponential change in the solution gradient and yields sharp estimates that agree well with numerical simulations .     along the length of the cylinder from @xmath14 to @xmath15.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the nonlinear diffusion equation  ( [ eq : diffusion - eqn ] ) has been studied in considerable detail for diffusivities @xmath13 having a variety of functional forms .",
    "particular emphasis has been placed on the special case of a power law , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , for which ( [ eq : diffusion - eqn ] ) is called the _ porous medium equation _ or pme ; an extensive literature exists for the pme that is thoroughly covered in the review by vzquez  @xcite . in a typical wetting scenario",
    "the pme is supplemented by boundary conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in which case the solution for a power - law diffusivity is well known to have compact support and to consist of a front propagating to the right with speed proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "ahead of the front , the solution is identically zero and when @xmath21 there is a discontinuity in the first derivative @xmath22 at the point where the front meets the @xmath23-axis ; otherwise , when @xmath24 , the wetting front meets the leading edge solution smoothly .",
    "the trailing edge of the front , on the other hand , always experiences a smooth transition similar to that shown in the saturation profile in figure  [ fig : geometry]b .",
    "analytical results have been derived for other types of diffusion coefficient , for example by shampine  @xcite who provides an existence - uniqueness proof for a general class of diffusivity functions with @xmath13 required to be a continuously differentiable function on @xmath25 , satisfying @xmath26 and @xmath27 when @xmath28 .",
    "this and other analytical studies are characterised by the fact that they pertain to _ degenerate diffusion _ for which the diffusivity vanishes identically at zero saturation .",
    "in contrast with this previous work , the diffusion coefficient we consider in this paper is an exponential function of saturation that , although small , is still bounded away from zero ; hence the solution remains everywhere classical and all disturbances propagate with infinite speed , analogous to solutions of the `` usual '' heat equation . when the pme wetting scenario described above is repeated for an exponential diffusivity , the solution remains non - zero for all times @xmath29 , even when the initial conditions have bounded support .",
    "nonetheless , the problem can be _ nearly degenerate _ in the sense that @xmath30 whereas @xmath31 for @xmath2 away from zero .",
    "for example , typical parameter values for a porous soil have been estimated as @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite .  for such diffusion coefficients",
    ", the solution inherits features that are qualitatively similar to the degenerate problem , most notably a steep wetting front that propagates with finite speed and that is associated with localised high curvature ( see figure  [ fig : power](b ) ) .",
    "we define the wetting front location @xmath34 to be the point where the curvature of @xmath6 is greatest , and for @xmath35 we have that @xmath36 .",
    "one feature that distinguishes the exponential diffusion equation from the pme is the fact that @xmath2 exhibits more rapid variation than for a power law , which in turn has a substantial impact on the shape of the solution close to the wetting front .",
    "a direct comparison is afforded by leech et al.s study of concrete  @xcite wherein they use experimental data to fit both power - law and exponential diffusivities , yielding respectively @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in figure",
    "[ fig : power ] , we plot the diffusion coefficients and corresponding saturation profiles for these two choices of @xmath13 .",
    "while the qualitative features of both solutions are similar , there is a significant difference in both the steepness and location of the wetting front , as well as the sharpness of the corner ( refer to the zoomed - in region in figure  [ fig : power](b ) ) .",
    "another distinguishing feature is that the solution in the exponential case is characterized by a small nonzero saturation ahead of the wetting front due to the fact that @xmath39 .",

    "in contrast with these iterative or numerical solution methods , we are interested here in developing an asymptotic series representation of the solution . one study of particular relevance is due to babu  @xcite who derived an asymptotic solution by making use of the simplifying assumption that both saturation and diffusivity drop to zero ahead of a certain wetting front location . although babu s asymptotic estimates are reasonably accurate",
    ", we will demonstrate that his approach of truncating the solution at the wetting front introduces significant errors that can be reduced by considering an alternate approach that incorporates the effect of the extremely small but still nonzero diffusivity values ahead of the front .",
    "other alternate series expansions based on an integral form of the exponential diffusion equation were derived by parlange and co - workers in @xcite . finally , we point out a connection to the work of elliott et al .",
    "@xcite who applied methods from singular perturbation theory to analyse the detailed structure of the transition region for the power - law diffusivity @xmath42 in the limiting case of @xmath43 , which is known as the _ mesa problem_. although this problem is still degenerate , the diffusivity in the large-@xmath44 limit experiences a rate of increase in @xmath2 approaching that of an exponential function ; therefore , the analysis for the mesa problem can be considered as a prototype for problems such as ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) .",
    "asymptotic solutions were developed for a semi - conductor dopant diffusion problem by king  @xcite for the two limits @xmath45 ( constant @xmath46 ) and @xmath43 ( mesa ) , and king and please  @xcite applied singular perturbation theory to obtain a matched asymptotic solution for the case @xmath47 ( linear @xmath46 ) ; however , the asymptotic structure of the solution for the exponential diffusion problem has not yet been explored in similar detail .",
    "we will demonstrate in this paper that a multi - layer asymptotic expansion is capable of yielding an accurate estimate of the wetting front location , provided that the exponentially varying solution is properly resolved close to the front .",
    "in particular , we will show that there is a self - similar solution @xmath48 that can be written in terms of the dimensionless similarity variable @xmath49 the corresponding wetting front location @xmath50 is a constant and has the asymptotic expansion @xmath51 the large parameter @xmath52 is related to the physical constant @xmath4 through the asymptotic expression @xmath53 where @xmath54 is obtained numerically .",
    "our asymptotic solution is distinct from other approximations derived in the literature in that it provides insight into the detailed structure of the wetting front , as well as yielding estimates of quantities such as @xmath50 that are accurate over a wide range of parameters .",
    "the estimate of wetting front location could be of particular interest to engineers since it expresses an easily measurable quantity in terms of physical parameters .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we motivate the problem under study by using the example of water transport in unsaturated porous media , although we stress that these results are equally applicable to other nonlinear diffusion problems having an exponential diffusivity . in section",
    "[ sec : self - similar ] we introduce a similarity transformation that permits us to recast problem as an ode initial value problem , for which @xmath55 is related to the magnitude of the initial slope of the similarity solution .",
    "section  [ sec : asymptotic ] derives our key results , consisting of a four - layer asymptotic expansion for the similarity solution , expressed as a series in @xmath56 on each layer .",
    "matching the asymptotic expressions then yields series approximations for the quantities of physical interest such as the saturation and curvature at the sharp corner in the wetting front , as well as the location @xmath41 of the front itself . in section",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we perform a detailed comparison of our asymptotic solution to other approximations in the literature , as well as validating the results with careful numerical simulations of the original governing partial differential equation .",
    "water transport in a saturated porous medium is well - known to obey darcy s law  @xcite , @xmath57 , which states simply that the liquid velocity @xmath58 ( in @xmath59 ) is proportional to the gradient of total hydraulic potential @xmath60 ( in @xmath44 ) .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath61 is known as the hydraulic conductivity and has units of @xmath59",
    ". however , many porous media flows are unsaturated , which means that the pore volume is only partially filled with liquid , and in this case it is necessary to introduce the liquid volume fraction or saturation , @xmath2 .",
    "the conductivity in a variably saturated porous medium is typically assumed to depend on the local saturation , leading to an extended darcy s law , @xmath62 , that includes a saturation - dependence in the hydraulic conductivity .",
    "when this expression for velocity is substituted into the continuity equation @xmath63 we obtain an evolution equation for @xmath2 @xmath64 which is known as the _ richards equation_. if both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are assumed to be single - valued functions of saturation , then we can define @xmath65 after which eq .",
    "( [ eq : richards ] ) reduces to the familiar nonlinear diffusion equation @xmath66 for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion - eqn ] ) is the 1d version .",
    "the function @xmath13 is referred to as the _ moisture diffusivity _ and has units of @xmath67 . as mentioned in the introduction , the exponential form ( [ eq : diffusion - dexp ] ) for diffusivity is motivated by the study of certain soils and porous building materials , for which an exponential function provides a good fit to experimental data .",
    "we consider an idealised , cylindrical geometry depicted in figure  [ fig : geometry]a that is consistent with the samples typically used in experimental studies of moisture transport .",
    "the porous cylinder is initially dry and has one end placed in a water reservoir .",
    "we are interested in problems such as the _ horizontal infiltration _ scenario pictured , or where capillary forces dominate over gravity , so that water is absorbed into the porous medium by capillary action alone .",
    "water progresses into the sample as a nearly planar wetting front , and so we can assume that the flow is uni - directional and governed by the one - dimensional diffusion equation  ( [ eq : diffusion - eqn ] ) .",
    "the length of the sample is denoted by @xmath15 , which is presumed large in relation to the diameter so that @xmath7 .    in order to treat a general class of wetting scenarios we take samples that are never completely dry , which corresponds to the usual situation",
    "wherein a porous medium undergoes re - wetting after an initial wetting / draining cycle .",
    "consequently , there exists a non - zero minimum or residual saturation @xmath68 deriving from water that is trapped in isolated portions of the porous matrix and which can not be displaced by capillary action .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a maximum saturation @xmath69 that can not be exceeded owing to micropores that are too small to allow water to penetrate , no matter how large the capillary force .",
    "consequently , the saturation @xmath2 satisfies @xmath70 , while the boundary and initial conditions are as specified in ( [ eq : diffusion - bcs ] ) and ( [ eq : diffusion - ic ] ) .",
    "water content is usually reported in the literature in terms of _ reduced saturation _ @xmath71for which the boundary and initial conditions reduce to @xmath72 a picture of a typical wetting front is displayed in figure  [ fig : geometry]b in terms of the rescaled saturation variable @xmath73 .",
    "we are now interested in finding a self - similar solution of the nonlinear diffusion equation on the half - space @xmath74 $ ] , when @xmath75 , and which satisfies the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath76 constant .",
    "the problem ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) is invariant under the scaling transformation @xmath77 , which suggests seeking a solution of the form @xmath78 , where the specific form of the similarity variable @xmath79 is chosen to eliminate certain constants from the ode and boundary conditions .",
    "we then define the new dependent variable @xmath80 where @xmath81 this form of solution is consistent with the second boundary condition  ( [ eq : diffusion - bcs ] ) provided that @xmath82 , which motivates our taking @xmath83 in what follows .",
    "this simplifies the problem further by eliminating the exponential diffusion coefficient ( [ eq : diffusion - dexp ] ) , leading to the following ode boundary value problem for @xmath48 :    [ eq : usim ] @xmath84    for the porous media of interest here , @xmath85 is significantly greater than one so that the parameter @xmath86 satisfies @xmath87 . rather than solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : usim ] ) directly it is convenient , for both the numerical and the asymptotic calculations , to reformulate this boundary value problem as an initial value problem , in which the boundary condition ( [ eq : usim - bcl ] ) is replaced by a second initial condition of neumann type given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 represents the initial slope which we will assume to be large .  from this point on ,",
    "we use ( [ eq : usim]@xmath90 ) to refer to the initial value problem consisting of equations ( [ eq : usim - u ] ) , ( [ eq : usim - ic1 ] ) and ( [ eq : usim - ic2 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic analysis performed in this paper considers the limit of @xmath91 which we will see shortly is equivalent to taking @xmath92 .",
    "the quantity @xmath56 is not known _ a priori _ in terms of the physical parameters , and so one of the primary results of this paper will be to first derive asymptotic expressions for @xmath85 and @xmath50 in terms of @xmath56 and to then invert them to give @xmath56 in terms of the physical quantities .    before moving on ,",
    "we address the suitability of applying alternate boundary conditions of neumann ( or flux ) type .",
    "first of all , it follows from equations ( [ eq : usim - u ] ) and ( [ eq : usim - ic1 ] ) , along with a later result indicating @xmath93 , that the dirichlet problem above has an implicit no - flux ( zero neumann ) condition at infinity .",
    "hence , there is no need to consider this case separately .",
    "when the left boundary condition is replaced with a flux contition of the form @xmath94 , no similarity solution is permitted unless @xmath95 , and in the zero - flux case there is only the trivial solution @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to focus on the dirichlet problem in ( [ eq : usim ] ) .      before proceeding with the analysis",
    ", we present several plots that illustrate the asymptotic behaviour of the self - similar solution for large @xmath56 , computed via numerical simulations of the initial value problem  ( [ eq : usim]@xmath90 ) .",
    "we use a shooting algorithm wherein a value of @xmath85 is chosen , and then @xmath97 is updated iteratively until @xmath98 is sufficiently close to the right hand boundary value @xmath99 .",
    "this approach is similar to that employed by others for the exponential diffusion problem  @xcite , and more details on our shooting algorithm are given in section  [ sec : numerical - algo ] . for illustration purposes ,",
    "we choose physical parameters corresponding to a typical soil water uptake experiment  @xcite .",
    "taking limiting values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and an unsaturated diffusivity @xmath102 , we obtain parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which clearly satisfies the requirement @xmath106 .",
    "we remark that other experiments on water transport in a wide range of porous media ( including soils , concrete , and other building materials ) suggest that allowable values of @xmath85 are restricted to a fairly narrow interval of @xmath107 .",
    "the resulting numerical solution is depicted in the two rightmost plots in figure  [ fig : gamma - all](c ) .",
    "the upper plot displays the computed similarity solution @xmath48 while the lower plot shows the corresponding curves for reduced saturation @xmath108 at ten equally - spaced time intervals , which are determined from @xmath48 by transforming back to physical variables eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) .    the computed solution for @xmath109 exhibits a well - defined wetting front that manifests in the @xmath73 plot as a narrow region with a steep slope located immediately behind a sharp corner . in the plot of @xmath98 on the other hand ,",
    "the steep front has been eliminated by the exponential stretching transformation ( [ eq : similar - sat ] ) , but the wetting front location is still identified with a sharp corner .",
    "a zoomed - in view of the wetting front is shown in the inset for @xmath109 and clearly indicates that the solution within the corner region transitions rapidly to a small value of saturation , but this transition remains smooth .",

    "even this more sensitive algorithm was unable to converge owing to the size of @xmath111 at the wetting front .",
    "the primary calculations of @xmath50 and @xmath112 over a range of values of @xmath56 were then enhanced by using richardson extrapolation .",
    "the primary contribution of @xcite was to provide clear numerical evidence to support the validity of the following expressions @xmath113 and @xmath114 which extends the asymptotics derived in this paper by one additional term .",
    "these results are in full agreement with our asymptotics and also hint at a more refined asymptotic calculation .",
    "in this paper we have performed a multi - layer asymptotic analysis of a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is an exponential function , @xmath115 .",
    "we focus on an application to the study of wetting front formation in unsaturated porous media flow , although exponential diffusion also arises in a number of other problems in heat transport , optical lithography , polymer diffusion , etc .",
    "the original boundary value problem for liquid saturation is reformulated as an initial value problem which , although not strictly necessary ( c.f .",
    "babu s solution  @xcite in section  [ sec : babu ] ) , nonetheless permits an easy comparison to numerics using an initial value solver .",
    "motivated by the structure of the wetting front for large values of @xmath4 , we used the method of matched asymptotics to derive a four - layer solution consisting of a different asymptotic series for each of four regions corresponding to the wetting , and the leading and trailing edges .",
    "other previous approaches to deriving ( approximate ) analytical solutions have assumed that the reduced saturation is identically equal to zero at a finite wetting front location , which essentially ignores the structure of the _ sharp corner _",
    "that appears at the front for large @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , our asymptotic solution uncovers the detailed structure of the transition within the wetting front , where the solution has very high curvature , and is considerably more accurate that other previous approaches for large @xmath4 .",
    "the asymptotic solution converges polynomially in @xmath4 and maintains a high degree of accuracy over a wide range of @xmath4 values corresponding to physical porous media such as soils and rock , unlike many other approaches which are either more limited in their applicability or exhibit a logarithmic singularity near the wetting front as @xmath4 becomes large .",
    "our approach has the additional advantage that it expresses the solution in terms of explicit formulas instead of requiring numerical approximation of a differential equation ( which is required in the approaches of wagner  @xcite or shampine  @xcite ) or inverting the exponential integral function ( as in parlange et al.s asymptotic solution  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , our estimate for @xmath50 may be of value to groundwater researchers and experimentalists since it provides an explicit formula for a measurable quantity ( wetting front location ) in terms of physical parameter values .",
