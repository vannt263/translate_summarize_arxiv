    "a major difference of color superconductors and metallic superconductors is that the former is a highly relativistic system in which the long - range magnetic interaction ( dynamically screened only by landau damping @xcite ) is responsible for the formation of the superconducting gap .",
    "the dynamically screened interaction leads to a nonstandard form of the gap , @xmath0 in the weak coupling region , with @xmath1 the strong coupling constant and @xmath2 the baryon chemical potential @xcite . despite this non - bcs feature of color superconductivity ,",

    "the gl free energy for a metallic superconductor without photon degrees of freedom has a global @xmath6 symmetry .",

    "however , the coupling to photon fluctuations may lead to a first order phase transition @xcite ; in particular , type i materials have a _ weak _ first order transition , characterized by a cubic term of the order parameter in the gl free energy .",
    "in color superconductors , a first order transition is also expected @xcite . however , there are crucial differences from metallic superconductors .",
    "firstly , the fluctuations of the diquark field alone may lead to a first order phase transition ; in fact , the gl free energy in color superconductivity ( without gluons ) has a global color - flavor symmetry , @xmath8 , which exhibits no infrared fixed - point in the renormalization group flow of the coupling constants , and is thus likely to show a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "secondly , thermal gluon fluctuations may induce a relatively _ strong _ first order transition , in contrast to the metallic case , partly because of the relativistic nature of the quarks and partly because of the large coupling constant @xmath9 @xcite . .",

    ", we adopted the ginzburg - landau free energy in three - spatial dimensions .",
    "although the phase transition of this model is second order in the mean - field approximation for coupling constants near those in weak coupling , it can be turned into a first order transition either by the thermal fluctuations of the scalar diquark field , or the gluon gauge field near the critical point .",
    "the relative importance of these two types of fluctuations is controlled by @xmath119 , the ratio of the masses of the scalar field and the gluon just below the critical temperature ; @xmath119 is also the ginzburg - landau parameter that differentiates type i and type ii color superconductors .",
    "in the high density regime where the weak coupling approximation is valid , we find that the system is type i and gauge fluctuations dominate over scalar fluctuations .    after evaluating the size of the critical region , outside of which",
    "the one - loop approximation is a reasonable approximation , we calculate the one - loop correction to the free energy from the thermal gluons in a type i color superconductor .",
    "the transition to color superconductivity becomes first order due to the induced cubic term in the gl free energy , which is similar to the case of the type i metallic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the strength of the first phase transition can be characterized by quantities such as the change of the critical temperature from its tree - level value , and the jump of the order parameter at the critical point .",
    "they indicate that the first order transition weakens with increasing baryon density .",
    "this behavior , which is quite reasonable in the sense that gluonic corrections are suppressed by @xmath145 in weak coupling , is in sharp contrast to that found for two - flavor color superconductivity in @xcite .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that one needs to take into account not only the cubic term of the order parameter ( which strengthens the first order transition ) but also thermal corrections to the quartic term ( which suppresses the first order transition ) to obtain a consistent result .",
    "since the ginzburg - landau free energy has an intrinsic spatial cutoff scale @xmath236 , which is of order the size of the diquark ( @xmath237 ) , such a correction to the quartic term is an inevitable consequence of the three - dimensional effective theory .",
    "we also find that the critical temperature of the first order transition , @xmath131 , is always lower than the @xmath37 of the second order transition in the mean - field approximation .",
    "our general considerations in this paper for a type i superconductor are valid insofar as the parameters in the ginzburg - landau free energy stay in the shaded area in fig .",

    "these effects may change the nature of the phase transition at low density from that realized at high densities .",
