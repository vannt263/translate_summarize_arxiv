    "the continuous time interlacement point process is related to the poisson point process of markov loops initiated in  @xcite , which later found various incarnations ( see , e.g. , theorem 2.1 of  @xcite , sections 4 and 3 of  @xcite , and @xcite , chapter 9 of  @xcite ) and was extensively analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "heuristically random interlacements correspond to a `` restriction to loops going through infinity '' of this poisson point process ; see  @xcite , page 85 .",

    "no such identity holds in our context when considering a fixed level @xmath6 ; see remark  [ rem2.4 ] .",
    "however , and this is the main object of this article , we present limiting procedures which relate the field of occupation times of random interlacements to the gaussian free field .",
    "the link with the two - dimensional gaussian free field comes as follows .",
    "we look at the occupation times of long vertical rods in @xmath56 , by random interlacements at properly tuned levels .",
    "let us incidentally mention that the consideration of long rods in the context of random interlacements has been helpful in several instances , for example , section 3 of  @xcite or section  5 of  @xcite .",
    "they typically have been used as a tool in the detection of long @xmath57-crossings in planes , left by the trajectories of the random interlacements at level @xmath6 , and have enabled us to quantify the rarity of such crossings when @xmath6 is small . here",
    "the rods in question are the subsets of @xmath56 , @xmath58 and the corresponding @xmath59-stationary field of occupation times is given by @xmath60 we choose the levels @xmath61 and @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 the choice in  ( [ 0.6])(i ) corresponds to a nondegenerate limiting probability @xmath64 that the interlacement at level @xmath65 does not meet any given rod @xmath66 [ see ( [ 4.74 ] ) ] whereas the choice in  ( [ 0.6])(ii ) induces a vanishing limit for the corresponding probability .",

    "may wonder whether some of the above results have counterparts in the case of a simple random walk on a large two - dimensional torus .",

    "some consequences of the above limit results for discrete occupation times of long rods can also be found in remark  [ rem4.10](2 ) .    in this article , we provide yet a further link between random interlacements and the gaussian free field , by considering the occupation times of random interlacements at a level @xmath6 tending to infinity .",

    "let us say a few words concerning proofs .",
    "we provide in theorem [ theo2.1 ] an expression for the characteristic function of @xmath85 , with @xmath46 finitely supported , which shows that close to the origin it can be expressed as the exponential of an analytic function .",
    "this identity on the one hand leads to  ( [ 0.3 ] ) ; see theorem  [ theo2.3 ] . on the other hand",
    ", this identity underlies the general line of attack , which we employ when proving the limit theorems corresponding to  ( [ 0.7])([0.10 ] ) and ( [ 0.11 ] ) ,  ( [ 0.12 ] ) . namely we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the power series representing the above mentioned analytic functions .",
    "the proof of  ( [ 0.8 ] ) is by far the most delicate .",
    "we analyze the large @xmath8 asymptotics of the power series , expressing the logarithm of the characteristic function of @xmath86 close to the origin , with @xmath87 finitely supported on @xmath59 , and such that @xmath88 .",
    "this asymptotic analysis relies on certain cancellations , which take place and enable us to control the coefficients of the power series . in the crucial theorem  [ theo4.1 ] we bound these coefficients , show the asymptotic vanishing of odd coefficients and compute the ( nonvanishing ) limit of even coefficients .",
    "this theorem contains enough information to yield both ( [ 0.8 ] ) and  ( [ 0.10 ] ) ; see theorem  [ theo4.2 ] .",
    "once ( [ 0.8 ] ) ,  ( [ 0.10 ] ) are proved ,  ( [ 0.7 ] ) ,  ( [ 0.9 ] ) follow in a simpler fashion and in essence only require the consideration of one single rod , say @xmath89 .",
    "the proof of  ( [ 0.11 ] ) ,  ( [ 0.12 ] ) in theorem  [ theo5.1 ] follows a similar pattern , but is substantially simpler .",
    "let us now describe how this article is organized .",
    "in section  [ sec1 ] we provide additional notation and collect some results concerning potential theory , the two - dimensional free field and zero - dimensional bessel processes .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] contains the identity for the characteristic functional of the field of occupation times in theorem  [ theo2.1 ] and the proof of formula  ( [ 0.3 ] ) for the laplace functional in theorem [ theo2.3 ] .",
    "the extension of these results to the set - up of weighted graphs can be found in remark  [ rem2.4](4 ) .    in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we collect estimates as preparation for the study in the next section of occupation times of long rods in @xmath56 .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] presents the limiting results  ( [ 0.7])([0.10 ] ) ( see theorems  [ theo4.2 ] and  [ theo4.9 ] ) relating random interlacements in @xmath56 to the two - dimensional free field .",
    "the heart of the matter lies in theorem  [ theo4.1 ] , where controls over the relevant power series are derived .",
    "in section  [ sec5 ] we prove  ( [ 0.11 ] ) ,  ( [ 0.12 ] ) in theorem [ theo5.1 ] and provide in remark  [ rem5.2 ] the extension of these results to the case of transient weighted graphs , and to discrete occupation times .",
    "finally let us explain our convention concerning constants .",
    "we denote with @xmath90 positive constants changing from place to place .",
    "numbered constants refer to the value corresponding to their first appearance in the text . in sections",
    "[ sec1 ] ,  [ sec2 ] and [ sec5 ] constants only depend on @xmath4 . in section  [ sec3 ] , where @xmath2 , they depend on @xmath91 in  ( [ 3.1 ] ) , and in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
