    "detection of cosmic @xmath0-rays in the very high energy range ( @xmath2 100 gev-50 tev ) using ground - based atmospheric cherenkov technique [ 1 - 2 ] allows a detailed study of the nonthermal universe and probes many phenomena of fundamental astrophysical interest including the acceleration and emission mechanisms in galactic and extragalactic sources , physics of pulsars and supernova remnants , study of extragalactic diffuse background etc .",
    "the recent success of the field has mainly resulted from the development of the cherenkov imaging telescopes which allows efficient separation of photon induced showers from the hadron background .",
    "the power of this technique has been convincingly demonstrated by several modern atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( e.g. magic [ 3 ] , veritas [ 4 ] , hess [ 5 ] and cangaroo [ 6 ] ) and there is now a general consensus that stereoscopic arrays provide the most promising avenue for future observations .",
    "a typical imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope consists of a light collector and a close - packed array of fast photomultiplier tubes ( also called the imaging camera with individual tubes as its pixels ) .",
    "the imaging camera records the spatial distribution of photons in the image ( called the cherenkov image ) and by exploiting the differences in the images produced by @xmath0-ray and cosmic - ray initiated showers , caused by the physical processes responsible for their development in the atmosphere , it becomes possible to effectively segregate the two event species on a statistical basis with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "simulation studies of atmospheric electromagnetic ( @xmath0-ray induced ) and hadronic ( proton induced ) cascades [ 7,8 ] have shown that there exist subtle differences in the image features ( shape , size and orientation ) of these event types .",
    "the image of an off - axis @xmath0-ray shower is relatively more compact and is elliptical in shape , with the major axis of the ellipse oriented towards the camera centre ( i.e. the source position ) . in the case of off - axis cosmic ray shower , on the contrary ,",
    "the image is comparatively bigger and irregular , besides having no preferred orientation ( because of isotropic nature of cosmic rays ) . remarkably indeed ,",
    "these predictions have been thoroughly matched by observations of various groups with great success and it is primarily because of the success of these experiments that the field of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy today boasts a catalog of more than a hundred @xmath0-ray sources [ 9 ] .    in an atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescope , there are several crucial parameters which need to be fine - tuned for maximizing the performance of the system . assuming that we are observing a point @xmath0-ray source with the telescope axis directly pointing towards it , these are : ( a ) the point spread function of the light collector , ( b ) the pixel size of the imaging camera , ( c ) trigger field of view and ( d ) trigger generation scheme .",
    "the optimum trigger field of view of an atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescope needs to be chosen in such a manner that the ratio of @xmath0-rays to the cosmic ray background is maximum .",
    "thus , for an imaging camera with a large field of view , it is generally advantageous to exclude the outer pixels from the trigger generation .",
    "these pixels only help to properly reconstruct the image parameters and do not increase the @xmath0-ray rate .",
    "the trigger in an atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescope is generated by demanding a coincidence between a number of pmts , with the condition that pixels participating in the trigger should have a signal exceeding some threshold q@xmath5 . the conventionally used multi - fold ( 2 to 4 )",
    "coincidence approach necessitates the operation of the telescope at a relatively higher threshold energy in order to keep the chance coincidence rate at a reasonable value .",
    "an improved trigger generation scheme involving two or three nearest neighbour pixels can be used instead for lowering the threshold energy of the telescope .",
    "the main aim of this work is to use monte carlo simulations for optimizing the above mentioned parameters for the tactic telescope .",
    "the tactic ( tev atmospheric cherenkov telescope with imaging camera ) @xmath0-ray telescope [ 10 ] has been in operation at mt .",
    "abu ( 24.6@xmath6 n , 72.7@xmath6 e , 1300 m asl ) , india , for the last several years to study tev gamma ray emission from celestial sources .",
    "the telescope uses a tessellated light - collector of area @xmath2 9.5m@xmath7 which is capable of tracking a celestial source across the sky .",
    "the telescope deploys a 349-pixel imaging camera , with a uniform pixel size of @xmath2 @xmath8 and a @xmath2 @xmath9@xmath1@xmath9 field - of - view , to record atmospheric cherenkov events produced by an incoming cosmic - ray particle or a @xmath0-ray photon with an energy above @xmath21tev . the tactic light - collector uses 34 front - face aluminium - coated , glass spherical mirrors of 60 cm diameter each with a focal length @xmath2 400 cm and reflection coefficient @xmath1080@xmath11 at a wavelength of @xmath2 400 nm .",
    "the point - spread function has a fwhm of @xmath2 0.185@xmath12 ( @xmath1312.5 mm ) and d@xmath14 @xmath2 0.34@xmath12 ( @xmath1322.8 mm ) . here , d@xmath14 is defined as the diameter of circle , concentric with the centroid of the image , within which 90@xmath11 of reflected rays lie .",
    "the value of d@xmath14 @xmath2 0.29@xmath12 ( @xmath1319.3 mm ) , predicted on the basis of the simulation for an incidence angle of 0@xmath12 , matches reasonably well with the measured value mentioned above . other details regarding the ray - tracing simulation procedure and comparison of the measured point - spread function of the tactic light collector with the simulated performance of ideal davies - cotton and paraboloid designs are discussed in [ 11 ] .",
    "the photographs of the tactic imaging telescope and its back - end signal processing electronics are shown in fig.1     ( a ) photograph of the 349-pixel tactic imaging telescope ( b ) photograph of back - end signal processing electronics used in the telescope.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the imaging camera uses 19 mm diameter photomultiplier tubes ( etl-9083 uvb ) . the bialkali photocathode has a maximum quantum efficiency of @xmath2 27@xmath11 and for this pmt the maximum quantum efficiency is usually reached in the wavelength range @xmath2 340 -360 nm . in order to ensure better light collection efficiency and reduction in the background light falling on the photomultipliers we use compound parabolic concentrator ( cpc ) as light guides on the photomultipliers .",
    "the cpcs used in the tactic imaging camera have the following specifications : entry aperture @xmath221.0 mm ; exit aperture @xmath215.0 mm ; and height @xmath217.6 mm .",
    "the light collection efficiency of the cpcs is estimated to be of @xmath265@xmath11 by using ray tracing simulations and includes both the geometrical collection efficiency and the reflectivity of the surface .",
    "the light collection efficiency mentioned above refers to those photons which undergo reflection after falling on the inside surface of the cpcs .",
    "the data acquisition and control system of the telescope [ 12 ] has been designed around a network of pcs running the qnx ( version 4.25 ) real - time operating system .",
    "the triggered events are digitized by camac based 12-bit charge to digital converters ( cdc ) which have a full scale range of 600 pc .",
    "the relative gain of the photomultiplier tubes is monitored by repeatedly flashing a blue led , placed at a distance of @xmath21.5 m from the camera .",
    "whenever the single channel rate of any two or more pixels in the trigger region goes outside the preset operational band , it is automatically restored to within the prescribed range by appropriately adjusting the high voltage of the pixels [ 13 ] .",
    "the imaging camera uses a programmable topological trigger [ 14 ] which can pick up events with a variety of trigger configurations . as",
    "the trigger scheme is not hard wired , a number of coincidence trigger options ( e.g nearest neighbour pairs , nearest neighbour non - collinear triplets and nearest neighbour non - collinear quadruplets ) can be generated under software control .",
    "the number of pixels participating in the trigger can be varied from 7@xmath17 pixels to 15@xmath116 pixels .",
    "apart from generating the prompt trigger with a coincidence gate width of @xmath218ns , the trigger generator has a provision for producing a chance coincidence output based on @xmath15@xmath16 combinations from various groups of closely spaced 12 channels .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that there are several reasons which compel us to use a coincidence gate width of @xmath218 ns instead of an optimal gate width @xmath17 5 ns .",
    "the reasons are the following : ( a ) variation in the transit time of the pmts because of being operated at different high voltage values , ( b ) variation in the propagation delay of 50 m long rg58 cables because of procurement of the cables in different batches , ( c ) degradation in the rise time of the pmt pulses when the signal is transmitted through a 50 m long rg58 cable and the subsequent time - walk of the leading edge discriminators which is dependent on the amplitude of the pmt output signal and ( d ) variation in the access time of static rams ( toshiba make tc55b417 ) used in the trigger generator and difference of @xmath2 4ns in the cascading and the non - cascading routes [ 14 ] .",
    "feasibility of using programmable digital delay generators for fine tuning the signal propagation time in all the channels is also being investigated so that the coincidence gate can be reduced to @xmath18 10ns .",
    "other details regarding the design , implementation and performance evaluation of the programmable topological trigger generator for the 349-pixel imaging camera of the tactic telescope are discussed in [ 14 ] .    a user friendly in - house developed tracking system software provides an independent movement for the zenithal and azimuthal axes so that a matching between the telescope pointing direction and the source direction is obtained with an accuracy better than @xmath192 arc - min .",
    "the tracking accuracy of the telescope is also checked on a regular basis with so called point runs , where a reasonably bright star , having a declination close to that of the candidate @xmath0-ray source is tracked continuously for about 5 hours .",
    "the point run calibration data ( corrected zenith and azimuth angle of the telescope when the star image is centered ) are then incorporated in the telescope drive system software so that appropriate corrections can be applied directly in real time while tracking a candidate @xmath0-ray source .",
    "other relevant details of the instrumentation aspects of the telescope are discussed [ 10 ] .",
    "the conventional approach of generating an event trigger in atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescopes is to use a majority type coincidence with trigger multiplicity of 2 to 4 .",
    "the optimum value of the trigger multiplicity is decided by several factors like observatory altitude , primary energy and zenith angle dependent intensity distribution of the cherenkov photons in the image plane and the pixel size . however , in order to keep the chance coincidence rate at a reasonable value ( usually few percent of prompt coincidence rate ) , the use of a majority type coincidence approach ( i.e. any @xmath20 present out of total @xmath21 detector channels , denoted by any - m , n here onwards ) , in generating the trigger , leads to a relatively higher threshold energy .",
    "the reason for this being the presence of @xmath22 factor in m - fold chance coincidence rate ( @xmath23 ) formula which is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25= @xmath22= @xmath26 is the number of all possible m - pixel combinations , @xmath27 is the shot - noise generated single channel rate passing the discriminator set at a threshold of @xmath28 ( in units of photoelectrons ) , @xmath20 is the number of detector channels which fire coincidently within a coincidence resolving time @xmath29 , @xmath21 is the total number of detector channels which can participate in producing the trigger .",
    "it has been assumed in the above formula that the contribution from higher multiplicity triggers ( i.e. due to coincidence of @xmath30 channels ) is negligible as compared to the m - fold chance coincidence rate and this can be satisfied easily as long as @xmath311 .",
    "keeping in view the compact nature of @xmath0-ray images , an elegant way to reduce the chance coincidence rate is to limit the number of @xmath20-fold combinations by using topological constraints in the trigger ( such as strict adjacency of triggering pixels or demanding that the pixels should lie within camera sectors ) .",
    "if @xmath32 is the number of m - fold nearest neighbour combinations the corresponding chance coincidence rate ( @xmath33 ) is given by : @xmath34 since , the number of nearest neighbour m - fold combinations ( @xmath32 ) is always less than the corresponding number of combinations in a simple majority type coincidence ( @xmath25 ) , there is a significant reduction in the chance coincidence rate when nearest neighbour m - fold trigger generation is used .",
    "thus , use of a nearest neighbour m - fold based trigger generation allows the individual pixels to operate at a relatively lower threshold which eventually leads to lowering the threshold energy of the telescope .",
    "an improved trigger generation scheme , based on the above concept was proposed by us [ 15 ] for the whipple system and a reduction in threshold energy by about 20@xmath11 is achieved by the group when a 2 adjacent /331 trigger condition instead of the conventional @xmath35 trigger condition is used [ 16 ] .",
    "this has resulted in @xmath240@xmath11 increase in the number of @xmath0-rays detected from the crab nebula [ 16 ] .",
    "the usefulness of the nearest - neighbour trigger generation scheme in achieving the lowest possible energy threshold has been demonstrated by other telescopes also including veritas , hess and magic [ 17,18 ] .",
    "the tactic imaging telescope also employs a programmable topological trigger generator with 2 ( or 3 ) nearest neighbour pixels participating in the trigger and the main aim of this work is to optimize the overall trigger generation scheme , both with respect to trigger multiplicity ( i.e. nn-2 versus nn-3 ) as well as number of pixels participating in the trigger .",
    "thus , the work involves comparing the performance of nn-2 and nn-3 trigger schemes with number of pixels participating in the trigger varying from 49 to 240 .",
    "the number of 2-fold and 3-fold combinations for majority type and nearest - neighbour coincidence for different numbers of pixels participating in the trigger is given in table.1    .",
    "the number of 2-fold and 3-fold combinations for majority and nearest - neighbour coincidence trigger schemes . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     on comparing the performance of nn-2 and nn-3 trigger configurations , one can notice the following : ( i ) in the case of nn-3 trigger , there is a marginal increase in the @xmath0-ray threshold energy when zenith angle is increased from 5@xmath36 to 25@xmath36 .",
    "( ii ) beyond @xmath37@xmath1025@xmath36 the @xmath0-ray threshold energy increases more rapidly for nn-3 trigger ( @xmath26.0tev at 45@xmath36 ) as compared to the nn-2 trigger . in the case of nn-2 trigger",
    "the @xmath0-ray threshold energy changes from 1.8tev at @xmath37=35@xmath36 to @xmath23.3tev at @xmath37=45@xmath36 . the resulting integral trigger rate for @xmath0-rays as a function of zenith angle is also seen to drop more rapidly in nn-3 trigger mode compared to the nn-2 trigger configuration .",
    "the reason for this being the fact that at larger zenith angles the cherenkov images produced by @xmath0-rays tend to be more compact as a result of increase in the line of sight distance to the shower maximum . using a nn-2 trigger methodology is thus a better option as against the nn-3 trigger configuration when a source needs to be observed at @xmath37@xmath10 30@xmath36 .",
    "advantage of using a nn-2 trigger configuration , for the hegra telescope with a pixel size of @xmath2 0.25@xmath36 , has also been pointed out in [ 21 ] while comparing the performance of various nearest neighbour trigger schemes with different multiplicities .",
    "the 349-pixel tactic imaging telescope , has been in operation at mt.abu , india since 2001 and has so far detected @xmath0-ray emission from the crab nebula , mrk 421 and mrk 501 .",
    "first successful detection of tev @xmath0-rays from the crab nebula was seen in the data collected by the telescope for @xmath2 41.5h between january 19 - february 23 , 2001 .",
    "the data was taken by using a nn-3 topological trigger with the innermost 240 pixels ( 15 x 16 matrix ) of the camera participating in generating the event - trigger .",
    "a statistically significant excess of @xmath26.3@xmath38 was seen in the data with @xmath2447@xmath1971 @xmath0-ray like events . during the last few years",

    "a major portion of this data has been collected with 121 pixels ( 11@xmath1 11 matrix ) participating in the trigger with either nn-2 or nn-3 trigger configuration and using a total of 225 pixels . at present , the telescope has a 5@xmath38 sensitivity of detecting crab nebula in 25 hours of observation time .",
    "this sensitivity figure has been verified several times over last 5 years and consolidated results on the crab nebula , for @xmath2310.5 h of observation time taken over a period of 3 observing seasons , is in preparation ..    for validating the monte carlo simulation results for nn-2 trigger mode we have used data on the crab nebula for @xmath2101.44 h between november 10 , 2005 - january 30 , 2006 . in this data sample ,",
    "the number of @xmath0-ray events obtained after applying the dynamic supercuts are found to be @xmath2(928@xmath19100 ) with a statistical significance of @xmath29.40@xmath38 [ 31 ] .",
    "similarly , for validating the simulation results for nn-3 trigger mode we have used data on the crab nebula for @xmath2105.16 h between november 03 , 2007 - march 8 , 2008 . after applying the dynamic supercuts to this data sample , the number of @xmath0-ray events are found to be @xmath2(968@xmath1990 ) with a statistical significance of @xmath211.1@xmath38 .",
    "data collected in the nn-2 trigger mode , during november 10 , 2005 - january 30 , 2006 , has also been used by us previously for checking the validity of the ann - based energy estimation procedure and for determining the energy spectrum of the crab nebula in the energy range 1 - 16 tev [ 31 ] . the @xmath0-ray differential spectrum obtained after using appropriate values of effective collection area and @xmath0-ray acceptance efficiency ( along with their energy and zenith angle dependence ) was found to be follow a power law @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 [ 31 ] . while the details of the standard dynamic supercuts procedure used by us to separate @xmath0-ray like images from the background cosmic rays can be found in [ 27,31 ] , in this work",

    "fig.12a shows measured values of cosmic - ray rate as a function of zenith angle .",
    "the zenith angle plotted in this figure has been multiplied with the sign of hour angle so that pre - upper transit and post - upper transit rates can be distinguished easily .",
    "each point in this plot represents a 10 minute observation run and the event rate has been calculated by dividing the number of events recorded in 600s .",

    "the corresponding monte carlo estimates ( solid line ) , with @xmath42 for nn-2 trigger and @xmath43 for nn-3 trigger , are also shown in fig.12a and fig.12b , respectively .",
    "although the monte carlo estimates are found to describe the zenith angle dependence of the measured rates reasonably well with an accuracy of @xmath4420@xmath11 for most of the 10 minute runs , presence of a systematic uncertainty in the experimental data can not be ruled out on account of sky condition variations , both on daily basis as well as from one lunation to other .",
    "differences in parameters like single pixel trigger threshold , overall photoelectron conversion factor etc .",
    "are also some of the additional factors because of which there can be a possible mismatch between simulated trigger rates and the corresponding experimental values .",
    "while work on understanding the telescope systematics is still in progress , we have used a value @xmath45 for systematic error in the measured cosmic - ray rate for further analysis .",
    "the justification for this is based on the guidance from [ 32 ] where the author has reported a variation of @xmath46 in the chrenkov photon density for mid - latitude sites on account of seasonal changes . although , one does not expect a significant variation in atmospheric extinction on a nightly basis for a good astronomical site , significant variation in atmospheric extinction on a nightly basis at mt .",
    "abu has been observed by us over the last several years .",
    "using a value @xmath45 for systematic error in the measured cosmic - rate is thus a fairly conservative estimate .",
    "the measured cosmic - ray rates have also been normalized to a zenith angle of 0@xmath36 and variation of the normalized rates as a function of run number is shown in fig.12c ( nn-2 trigger ) and fig.12d ( nn-3 trigger ) . in order to quantify departures from a flat shape , we have also calculated the @xmath47 by using the following expression [ 33 ] @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of 10 minute runs , @xmath50 is the normalized measured cosmic - ray rate with @xmath51 as the corresponding statistical error , @xmath52 is the relative systematic uncertainty and @xmath53 is the normalized monte carlo simulated trigger rate .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath54 ( probability = 0.40 ) obtained for the nn-2 trigger observation spell and @xmath55 ( probability = 0.07 ) obtained for the nn-3 trigger observation spell clearly suggest that there is a reasonably good matching between the simulated trigger rates and the experimentally measured trigger rates .",
    "presence of a systematic error at @xmath56 level for november 2007 - march 2008 data may also be contributing to the relatively higher value of @xmath47 for this data spell .",
    "the homogeneity of the triggers produced within the trigger field of view is another test to check the performance of the trigger generation scheme .",
    "although finding the frequency distribution of the triggered pixels would have been the best way to validate this , unavailability of the hit pattern data at the hardware level does not allow us to check this directly . to circumvent this",
    ", we determine the frequency distribution of the image centroid coordinates by using the following approach .",
    "first , the data is corrected for inter - pixel gain variation and then subjected to the standard two - level image cleaning procedure [ 27 ] with picture and boundary thresholds of 6.5@xmath38 and 3.0@xmath38 respectively . in the clean cherenkov image ,",

    "the corresponding number of cells , for the nn-3 data ( fig.13b ) , is found to be @xmath82 .",
    "presence of non - functional pixels in the camera ( typically in the range of 3 to 7 in a total of 225 pixels and whose location keeps on changing with time ) as well as excessive trigger rate in some pixels due to presence of relatively bright stars are the 2 main causes because of which @xmath80 is more than @xmath83 in some regions of the camera .",
    "compatibility of the trigger rates with poissonian statistics and homogeneity of the triggers produced within the trigger field of view clearly suggest that the overall performance of the telescope is quite stable and the monte carlo simulation estimates regarding effective collection area and @xmath0-ray acceptance are also quite reliable .",
    "the agreement between the expected and actual performance of the telescope has also been checked by comparing the expected and observed image parameter distributions and results of this study can be seen in [ 10 ] .",

    "however , more work has to be done with regard to relative calibration of the telescope ( along the lines suggested in [ 34 ] ) so that unavoidable systematic errors as a result of temporal changes in the light collection efficiency , gain and , most importantly , atmospheric conditions can be accounted for in the analysis .",
    "a detailed simulation study for the tactic telescope has been presented in this work for optimizing its trigger field of view and the trigger generation scheme .",

    "reasonably good matching of the measured trigger rates ( on the basis of @xmath2 207 hours of data collected with the telescope in nn-2 and nn-3 trigger configurations ) with that obtained from simulations reassures that the procedure followed by us in estimating the threshold energy and detection rates is quite reliable .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present the results of monte carlo simulations of @xmath0-ray and cosmic ray proton induced extensive air showers as detected by the tactic atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescope for optimizing its trigger field of view and topological trigger generation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation study has been carried out at several zenith angles . </S>",
    "<S> the topological trigger generation uses a coincidence of 2 or 3 nearest neighbour pixels for producing an event trigger . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this study suggest that a trigger field of 11@xmath111 pixels ( @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath1 @xmath3 ) is quite optimum for achieving maximum effective collection area for @xmath0-rays from a point source . with regard to optimization of topological trigger generation </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that both 2 or 3 nearest neighbour pixels yield nearly similar results up to a zenith angle of  @xmath4 with a threshold energy of @xmath2 1.5 tev for @xmath0-rays . beyond zenith angle of  @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , the results suggest that a 2-pixel nearest neighbour trigger should be preferred . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the simulated integral rates has also been made with corresponding measured values for validating the predictions of the monte carlo simulations , especially the effective collection area , so that energy spectra of sources ( or flux upper limits in case of no detection ) can be determined reliably . </S>",
    "<S> reasonably good matching of the measured trigger rates ( on the basis of @xmath2 207 hours of data collected with the telescope in nn-2 and nn-3 trigger configurations ) with that obtained from simulations reassures that the procedure followed by us in estimating the threshold energy and detection rates is quite reliable .    </S>",
