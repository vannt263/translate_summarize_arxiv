    "in the past decades , substantial experimental and theoretical efforts were devoted to find the optimal ways to tune the optical properties of semiconductors and graphene by application of external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the motivation of this research lies in the potential applications for integrated circuits in optical and quantum computers , for secure information transfer , and in new light sources.@xcite one of the promising approaches is in the use of polaritons , which are a quantum superposition of cavity photons and excitons in a nanometer - wide semiconductor layer ( a quantum well ) or graphene.@xcite since polaritons are interacting bose particles , a polariton gas can transit to a superfluid state that , under certain conditions , propagates in a microcavity almost without dissipation.@xcite due to a small effective mass , @xmath0 of the free electron mass , the superfluid transition occurs at relatively high temperatures that are comparable with the room temperature .",
    "polaritons can propagate in the sample with a speed up to a few percent of the speed of light that is , much faster than that of electric - field driven electrons and holes in semiconductors.@xcite however , one of the main problems to be solved in actual design of polariton - based optical devices is in weak response of polaritons to an external electric field owing to their net zero electric charge .            in this paper , we propose a design of polariton - based , electrically controlled switch , in which the polariton propagation is controlled by means of a drag force .",
    "recently , it was shown that the drag caused by an electric current results in entrainment of polaritons and in formation of a persistent , directed polariton current in the microcavity.@xcite in this case , this is a drag force that is exerted on the exciton component of polaritons that results in generation of the polariton flux proportional to the driving electric field @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the temperature - dependent drag coefficient .",
    "in addition to the electrically controlled drag force , the polaritons can also be accelerated by a constant , time independent force , which is caused by the wedge - like shape of the microcavity.@xcite in the latter case , the effect of the constant force is similar to application of a dc voltage in electric circuits . by changing",
    "the magnitude and direction of the electric current one can vary the net force exerted on the polaritons and thus , to control the polariton propagation .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the polariton switches of two types . in the first design ,",
    "the polariton flow in the switch is produced by a constant force due to the wedge - like shape of the microcavity whereas the drag force is utilized to switch the direction of the flow . in the second design ,",
    "the polariton flow in the required direction is only produced by the drag force .",
    "the photons propagate in the planar microcavity , and the excitons are located in a quantum well embedded in the microcavity .",
    "below we describe the both types of the switches in details .    in the first design , we take advantage of a patterned microcavity to create a potential - energy landscape for polaritons in the form of one - dimensional channels , or `` polariton wires '' , which are somewhat similar to the ordinary wires that conduct electrical current .",
    "however , in our case , the wires conduct polaritons and help one to deliver photons to a desired location in the semiconductor structure . recently developed experimental techniques , which enable one to produce such guiding potentials for polaritons , include deposition of a metal pattern on the bragg reflectors@xcite and modulation of the cavity layer thickness in a mesa structure.@xcite the polariton channels of complex shape and topology can also be engineered directly in an air - filled microcavity by creating quasi - one - dimensional waveguides , or micropillars.@xcite    to design a polariton switch , we utilize a y - shaped channel shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we assume that polaritons are created at a constant rate by the external laser pumping at the stem of the channel and then , propagate towards the junction under the action of a constant force due to the microcavity wedge - like shape . after reaching the junction , the polariton flow splits between the two branches .",
    "if no drag force is applied to the polaritons , the flux is distributed equally between the branches . however ,",
    "if the drag force is exerted on the polaritons in the region of the junction in the direction normal to the stem , the polaritons are `` pushed '' towards one branch and hence , the flux in that branch increases .",
    "simultaneously , the flux through another branch decreases due to approximate conservation of the total number of polaritons and in effect , the polariton flux is redistributed between the branches .",
    "the drag force in the junction region is produced by the electric current running in a neighboring quantum well , which has a form of a stripe placed in a microcavity perpendicular to the stem of the channel .",
    "thus , the heterostructure encompasses two parallel quantum wells , separated by a nanometer - wide semiconductor of dielectric barrier , placed in an optical microcavity .",
    "heterostructures embedded in a microcavity are widely used in the studies of exciton dynamics@xcite and in experiments with polaritons.@xcite we demonstrate below that more than 70% of the total polariton flux can be dynamically redistributed between the branches for realistically achievable drag forces .",
    "the second type of the polariton switch is based on a flat microcavity where the mirrors are parallel to each other . in this design ,",
    "the excitons are located in a y - shaped semiconductor quantum well , and the neighboring current - carrying quantum well geometrically repeats the shape of the structure , see fig .",
    "in contrast to the first type of the switch described above , here we do not use the patterned microcavity . instead , the polaritons are guided by the y - shaped semiconductor structure .",
    "the electric current in the quantum well is generated by the external voltage .",
    "the drag force exerted on the cavity polaritons by the electric current is directed parallel to the channel and induces the polariton flow along one of the branches .",
    "the polariton flow is redistributed between the branches in response to switching of the electric voltage applied to the current - carrying quantum well .    in both designs ,",
    "the quantum wells containing the excitons can be fabricated by using a number of materials , including gaas,@xcite cdte,@xcite wse@xmath4,@xcite and gapped graphene.@xcite while the polariton condensate was experimentally observed when the polaritons are formed by excitons in a semiconductor quantum well  @xcite , in this paper we focus on microcavity polaritons formed by excitons in graphene .",
    "one of the advantages to use graphene is related to the properties of polaritons in gapped graphene that can be tuned by application of a static electric field normal to the microcavity plane .",
    "specifically , the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands can be created and changed by the electric field in a wide range.@xcite this enables one to tune the polariton effective mass and the sound velocity in the spectrum of the quasiparticles  @xcite and through that to optimize the performance of the system , as detailed below .",
    "another advantage of considering excitons in a graphene layer compared to a semiconductor quantum well is the absence of the fluctuations of the width due to the fact that graphene is a 2d one atom - thick material .",
    "such fluctuations cause the disorder which results to the decrease of the drag coefficients due to the scattering of the excitons on the random field .",
    "thus , in both designs of the polariton switch described above we consider graphene embedded in microcavity .",
    "our consideration of the switch with polaritons formation in a quantum well currently is in progress .",
    "the dynamics of the polariton condensate was captured via the non - equilibrium gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate wave function @xmath5@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the polariton mass , @xmath8 is a two - dimensional vector in the plane of the microcavity , and time @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the polariton - polariton interaction strength , @xmath11 is the polariton lifetime , and the source terms @xmath12 describes incoherent laser pumping of the polariton reservoir . in our simulations , we set @xmath13 ps as a representative value.@xcite    the effective potential for the polaritons @xmath14 is the sum of the confining potential owing to microcavity patterning @xmath15 , a linear potential corresponding to a constant accelerating force in a wedge - shaped microcavity @xmath16 , and a time - dependent drag @xmath17 caused by the driving electric current .",
