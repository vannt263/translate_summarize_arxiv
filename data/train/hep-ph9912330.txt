    "the same polarization asymmetries are displayed as a function of each higgs - boson mass for the same set of the phases in fig .  5 by taking a larger value of @xmath167 rather than @xmath62 as in fig .  4",
    "unlike the small @xmath61 case , @xmath168 is allowed so that the polarization asymmetries ( dash  dotted line ) for the phase value are also considered in the discussion .",
    "we note from fig .  5 that ( i ) even for the lightest higgs boson @xmath12 , the polarization asymmetries @xmath90 and @xmath186 can be as large as 40% and 7% , respectively and the deviation of @xmath181 from the unity can be as large as 10% unlike the small @xmath61 case , ( ii ) the polarization asymmetries @xmath83 for the heavier higgs bosons @xmath13 and @xmath175 are determined mainly by the top / bottom and stop / sbottom loop contributions above the top - quark  pair threshold , while below the top - quark  pair threshold the main contributions come from the top / bottom and @xmath50 loops , and ( iii ) for large @xmath174 values ( @xmath190 and @xmath166 ) the @xmath0parities of the heavier higgs bosons are interchanged as can be checked in the two lower frames of the right column for @xmath181 .    combining the numerical results from figs .  4 and 5 , we can conclude that for a small @xmath61 the best @xmath0 observable is the polarization asymmetry @xmath186 whereas for a large @xmath61 the polarization asymmetry @xmath191 is the most powerful observable for detecting @xmath0violation in the production of the lightest higgs boson .",
    "therefore , for a small @xmath61 it is necessary to prepare the colliding photon beams with large linear polarizations , but those with large circular polarizations for a large @xmath61 .",
    "on the other hand , all the polarization asymmetries @xmath83 for the heavy higgs bosons @xmath13 and @xmath175 are mostly very sensitive to the the @xmath0violating phase @xmath174 irrespective of the value of @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , the polarization asymmetries @xmath90 and @xmath186 are complementary in the sense that in the mass range where one asymmetry is insensitive to @xmath174 the other one is always sensitive to the phase .",
    "we have studied the possibility of measuring the @xmath0 properties of the higgs bosons in the mssm with explicit cp violation in the production of all the three neutral higgs bosons in two  photon fusion with polarized back  scattered laser photons .",
    "our detailed analysis has clearly shown that collisions of polarized photons can provide a significant opportunity for detecting @xmath0 violation in the mssm higgs sector induced at the loop level from the stop and sbottom sectors .    0.3 cm",
