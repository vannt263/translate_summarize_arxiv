    "narrow line magneto - optical traps ( mots ) are rapidly becoming powerful tools in a diverse array of experimental studies .",
    "these unique and versatile systems have , for example , already been used as integral components in obtaining fully maximized mot phase - space densities @xcite , nuclear - spin based sub - doppler cooling @xcite , all - optical quantum degenerate gases @xcite , and recoil - free spectroscopy of both dipole allowed @xcite and doubly - forbidden @xcite optical transitions . in the future ,",
    "narrow line mots promise to revolutionize the next generation of high precision optical frequency standards @xcite .",
    "narrow line cooling , via the relative size of the transition natural width @xmath3 and the single - photon recoil frequency shift @xmath4 , also displays a unique set of thermal - mechanical laser cooling dynamics . in a previous paper @xcite , we explored these behaviors by cooling @xmath2sr on the @xmath0 - @xmath1 intercombination transition . in the present work ,",
    "we significantly expand upon this discussion and provide a comprehensive description of the experimental techniques used to realize and study @xmath0 - @xmath1 cooling and trapping .    fully understanding narrow line laser cooling",
    "requires first clarifying the difference between broad and narrow doppler cooling lines .",
    "broad lines , historically used for nearly every laser cooling experiment @xcite , are defined by @xmath3/@xmath4 @xmath5 1 .",
    "the 461 nm @xmath2sr @xmath0 - @xmath6 transition shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , which typifies a broad line , has , for example ,",
    "@xmath3/@xmath4 @xmath7 3@xmath810@xmath9 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath3 , or more generally the power - broadened linewidth @xmath10 , is the natural energy scale . here , @xmath10",
    "= @xmath11 is defined by the saturation parameter @xmath12 = @xmath13/@xmath14 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the single - beam peak intensity ( transition saturation intensity ) .",
    "semiclassical physics thus governs the cooling process and the photon recoil , although essential to quantitatively understanding energy dissipation @xcite , serves more as a useful conceptual tool than a dominant player in system dynamics . moreover , gravity is essentially negligible since the ratio of the maximum radiative force to the gravitational force , @xmath15 = @xmath16/2@xmath17 , is typically on the order of 10@xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are plank s constant , the light field wavevector , the atomic mass , and the gravitational acceleration , respectively .",
    "in contrast , narrow doppler cooling lines are characterized by @xmath3/@xmath4 @xmath7 1 .",
    "the 689 nm @xmath2sr @xmath0 - @xmath1 transition used in this work , for example , has @xmath3/@xmath4 = 1.6 where @xmath3/2@xmath23 ( @xmath4/2@xmath23 = @xmath24/4@xmath25 ) is 7.5 khz ( 4.7 khz ) . in this case , the relevant thermal - mechanical energy scale and thus the underlying semiclassical or quantum mechanical nature of the cooling depends on @xmath12 .",
    "details of a given cooling process are then set by the laser detuning 2@xmath26 = @xmath27",
    "= @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the laser ( atomic resonance ) frequency .",
    "in particular , @xmath31 @xmath32 0 @xmath0 - @xmath1 mot dynamics can be divided into three qualitatively distinct regimes , hereafter labeled ( i - iii ) , defined by the relative size of @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath3 @xmath7 @xmath4 , and @xmath10 . in regime ( iii ) , corresponding to trapping beam intensities on the order of @xmath14 = 3@xmath34w/@xmath35 or @xmath12 @xmath7 1 , @xmath4 is the natural energy scale . here ,",
    "single photon recoils and consequently , quantum physics , govern trap dynamics .",
    "this situation enables limiting temperatures of roughly half the photon recoil limit ( @xmath36 = 2@xmath37/@xmath38 = 460 nk , where @xmath38 is boltzmann s constant ) despite the incoherent excitation provided by the trapping beams @xcite .",
    "conversely , for @xmath12 @xmath39 1 the system evolves toward semiclassical physics where @xmath10 @xmath39 @xmath4 and hence @xmath10 is the dominant energy scale . in this case , cooling and motional dynamics are determined by the relative size of @xmath10 and @xmath27 . in regime ( ii ) , the @xmath27 @xmath32 @xmath10 radiative force produces damped harmonic motion and , in analogy to standard doppler cooling , mot thermodynamics set entirely by the velocity dependence of the force @xcite . for these conditions , the expected @xmath31- and @xmath12-dependent temperature minima are observed , although with values globally smaller than standard doppler theory predictions .",
    "alternatively , in regime ( i ) where @xmath27 @xmath40 @xmath10 , the atom - light interaction is dominated by single - beam photon scattering and trap thermodynamics become intimately linked to both the velocity and the _ spatial _ dependence of the force .",
    "here , gravity plays an essential role as the ratio @xmath15 for the @xmath0 - @xmath1 transition is only @xmath7 16 .",
    "consequently , the atoms sag to vertical positions where the zeeman shift balances @xmath31 , leading to @xmath31-independent equilibrium temperatures .",
    "narrow line cooling also displays a unique set of @xmath31 @xmath40 0 thermal and mechanical dynamics . for these experiments ,",
    "the atomic gas is first cooled to @xmath34k temperatures and then @xmath31 is suddenly switched from @xmath31 @xmath32 0 to @xmath31 @xmath40 0 .",
    "subsequently , the sample evolves from a thermal distribution to a discrete set of momentum - space packets whose alignment matches lattice points on a three - dimensional ( 3d ) face - centered - cubic crystal @xcite . up to 26 independent packets are created with @xmath31- and @xmath12-dependent lattice point filling factors .",
    "note this surprising behavior occurs in the setting of incoherent excitation of a non - degenerate thermal cloud . to obtain qualitative insight into the basic physics ,",
    "we begin with an analytic solution to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) semiclassical radiative force equation . here , we show that @xmath31 @xmath40 0 excitation enables `` positive feedback '' acceleration that efficiently bunches the atoms into discrete sets of @xmath31- and @xmath12-dependent velocity space groups . a simple generalization of the 1d model is then used to motivate the experimentally observed 3d lattice structure .",
    "this intuitive picture is then confirmed with numerical calculations of the final atomic velocity and spatial distributions . using the numerical calculations ,",
    "we also show that @xmath31 @xmath40 0 momentum - space crystals are a universal feature of standard doppler cooling and that observations should be possible , although increasingly impractical , with broad line molasses .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that @xmath15 directly influences @xmath31 @xmath40 0 thermodynamics , enabling cooling around a @xmath31- and @xmath12-dependent velocity @xmath41 where gravity balances the radiative force .",
    "observed values for @xmath41 agree well with numerical predictions while cooling is evident in distinctly asymmetric cloud spatial distributions that appear in both numerical calculations of the cooling process and the experiment . as with momentum crystal formation , gravitationally assisted @xmath31 @xmath40 0 cooling is universal to doppler limited systems . in the more typical case",
    "where @xmath15 @xmath7 10@xmath18 , however , equilibrium temperatures ( @xmath41 ) are on the order of hundreds of milli - kelvin ( 100 m / s ) rather than the more useful micro - kelvin ( @xmath7 10 cm / s ) values achieved with narrow lines .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives an overview of the 461 nm @xmath0 - @xmath6 mot used to pre - cool @xmath2sr to @xmath7 2.5 mk .",
    "@xmath42 metastable excited - state magnetic traps that are continuously loaded by the @xmath0 - @xmath6 cooling cycle are also described .",
    "section iii details the highly stabilized 689 nm light source and the process used to transfer @xmath2sr from the @xmath0 - @xmath6 mot to the @xmath0 - @xmath1 mot .",

    "conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "pre - cooling @xmath2sr to milli - kelvin temperatures is an essential requirement for observing @xmath0 - @xmath1 cooling and trapping dynamics @xcite . for this purpose , as shown by fig .",
    "1(b ) , we use a standard six - beam 461 nm @xmath0 - @xmath6 mot that is loaded by a zeeman slowed and transversely cooled atomic beam .",
    "the atomic beam is generated by an effusion oven ( 2 mm nozzle diameter ) whose output is angularly filtered by a 3.6 mm diameter aperture located 19.4 cm from the oven nozzle .",
    "separate heaters maintain the oven body ( nozzle ) at 525 @xmath43c ( 725 @xmath43c ) , resulting in a measured flux ( divergence half - angle ) of 3@xmath810@xmath44 atoms / s ( 19 mrad ) .",
    "the atomic beam is then transversely cooled by 2-dimensional 461 nm optical molasses .",
    "the elliptical cross - section molasses laser beams have a 1/e@xmath45 diameter of @xmath7 3 cm ( @xmath7 4 mm ) along ( normal to ) the atomic beam propagation axis , contain 10 - 20 mw of power , and are detuned from the @xmath0 - @xmath6 resonance by -15 mhz .",
    "stray magnetic fields in the transverse cooling region are less than 1 g. subsequently , the atomic beam passes through a 6.4 mm diameter electro - mechanical shutter and a gate valve that allows the oven to be isolated from the rest of the vacuum system .    after exiting the transverse cooling region",
    ", the atomic beam enters a water cooled 20 cm long constant deceleration @xmath46 zeeman slower @xcite with a peak magnetic field of @xmath7 600 g , corresponding to a capture velocity of @xmath7 500 m / s .",
    "the 461 nm zeeman slower cooling laser is detuned from the @xmath0 - @xmath6 resonance by -1030 mhz , contains 60 mw of power , and is focused to approximately match the atomic beam divergence .",
    "the window opposite the atomic beam is a z - cut sapphire optical flat that is vacuum sealed via the kasevich technique @xcite , broadband anti - reflection coated on the side opposite the chamber , and heated to 200 @xmath43c to prevent the formation of sr coatings .",
    "the alternating current window heater , which produces a small stray magnetic field , is only operated during the @xmath0 - @xmath6 mot pre - cooling phase . a separate compensation coil reduces the slower magnetic field magnitude ( gradient ) to @xmath32 100 mg ( @xmath32 8 mg / cm ) at the trapping region , located 15 cm from the slower exit . stray magnetic fields at the trap are further nulled by three sets of orthogonally oriented helmholtz pairs .",
    "the trapping chamber is a cylindrical octagon with six 2 3/4  ( two 6  ) ports in the horizontal x - y plane ( along gravity z - axis ) .",
    "all windows are broadband anti - reflection coated .",
    "the mot anti - helmholtz coils , oriented such that the axial magnetic field gradient db@xmath47 lies along gravity , are mounted on a computer controlled precision linear track that allows the coil center to be translated from the trapping chamber to a 1 cm @xmath8 1 cm @xmath8 4 cm rectangular glass cell .",
    "the coils are constructed to provide window - limited optical access to the geometric center of the trapping chamber and produce axial gradients of 0.819 g/(cm - a ) .",
    "the gradient is linear over a spatial range of @xmath7 @xmath48 3 cm in both the axial and transverse directions .",
    "current in the coils is regulated by a computer controlled servo and monitored with a hall probe . for the @xmath0 - @xmath6 mot , the axial magnetic field gradient db@xmath47/dz = db@xmath47 = 50 g / cm .",
    "the trapping chamber is evacuated by a 40 @xmath49/s ion pump and a titanium sublimation pump while the oven chamber uses a 40 @xmath49/s ion pump .",
    "the two chambers are separated by a 6.4 mm @xmath8 45 mm cylindrical differential pumping tube located between the electro - mechanical shutter and the gate valve .",
    "typical vacuum levels in the oven , trapping , and glass cell chambers during operation of the atomic beam are 2@xmath810@xmath50 torr , 1.5@xmath810@xmath51 torr , and 3@xmath810@xmath52 torr , respectively .",
    "461 nm cooling and trapping light is produced by frequency doubling the output from a ti : sapphire laser in two external buildup cavities @xcite that together produce @xmath40 220 mw of single - mode light .",
    "the 461 nm light is then offset locked to the @xmath0 - @xmath6 resonance by saturated absorption feedback to the ti : sapphire laser .",
    "relative frequencies of the transverse cooling , zeeman slower , and trapping laser beams are controlled with acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) which are also used as shutters .",

    "the equilibrium temperature of the upward moving layer can be calculated by following the same procedure used to derive eq .",
    "[ r1temp ] . here , however , we set @xmath131 = 0 in eq .",
    "[ fe1 ] and perform the taylor expansion about @xmath88 = @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath31-independent effective detuning is then @xmath132 which leads to damping and diffusion coefficients identical to eq .",
    "[ damp ] and [ diff ] , respectively .",
    "hence , the expected equilibrium temperature is given by eq .",
    "[ r1temp ] .",
    "thus , gravity , via the ratio @xmath15 , again plays an important role in narrow line thermodynamics , in this case enabling @xmath31 @xmath40 0 cooling .",
    "unfortunately , this prediction can not be accurately verified due to spatial overlap among the horizontal plane packets in the upward moving cube layer . the observed and theoretically predicted sharp vertical spatial distributions in figs .",
    "17(a ) and 17(c ) , however , strongly suggest that @xmath31 @xmath40 0 cooling is operative in the experiment .",
    "finally , note that although this same cooling mechanism should occur for broad lines where @xmath15 @xmath7 10@xmath18 , @xmath41 in this case has impractical values on the order of 100 m / s .",
    "moreover equilibrium temperatures are large , at roughly 160@xmath8(@xmath133/2@xmath38 ) @xmath7 200 mk for the @xmath0 - @xmath6 transition even at @xmath12 = 1 .",
    "in summary , narrow line laser cooling exhibits a wealth of behaviors ranging from novel semiclassical dynamics wherein gravity can play an essential role to quantum mechanically dominated sub - photon recoil cooling . in the @xmath31 @xmath32 0 semiclassical case , trap dynamics are set by either hard wall boundaries or a linear restoring force .",
    "qualitative differences between these two situations are reflected in both the atomic motion and the equilibrium thermodynamics . here , mechanical dynamics range from free - flight in a box potential to damped harmonic oscillation .",
    "accordingly , equilibrium temperatures range from detuning independent values scaled by the power - broadened transition linewidth to detuning dependent minima well below the standard doppler limit .",
    "as the saturation parameter approaches unity , the trap enters a quantum mechanical regime where temperatures fall below the photon recoil limit despite the incoherent trapping beam excitation . for @xmath31 @xmath40 0 , the cloud divides into momentum - space crystals containing up to 26 well defined lattice points and the system exhibits @xmath31 @xmath40 0 gravitationally assisted cooling .",
    "these surprising @xmath31 @xmath40 0 behaviors , which again occur due to an incoherent process , are theoretically universal features of doppler limited systems .",
    "observations should therefore be possible , although difficult , with broad line optical molasses .",
    "perhaps a similar @xmath31 @xmath40 0 mechanical evolution also occurs for atoms , such as the more typically employed alkali metals , that support both doppler and sub - doppler cooling .",
