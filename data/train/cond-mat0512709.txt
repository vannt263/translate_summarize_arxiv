    "as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ phase3 ] , [ cave0 ] , and [ cave2 ] , the effect of this improvement becomes important for thin films .",
    "these plots show that the transitions between stable phases occur at virtually the same value of @xmath69 in the op - nldf theory and in the improved sfm .",
    "furthermore , the application of the latter approach for planar slits also yields better agreement with nldf results as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase4 ] .    according to our calculations",
    "almost all the examined adsorbate - substrate combinations will form cc at @xmath110 , the exceptions are ne , ar , kr , and xe adsorbed into cavities of cs . in these cases",
    "it becomes necessary an extra determination of critical temperatures for cc like it has been done in @xcite . in this respect",
    ", it should be mentioned that it has been previously found that neither ne confined by planar walls of cs @xcite nor ne and ar adsorbed into cylinders of cs @xcite form cc at @xmath180 , showing a systematic dependence on the pore curvature .",
    "the critical radii for metastable phases and unstable films displayed in fig .  [ coals ] resemble the behavior found previously for cylindrical pores @xcite .",
    "so , adsorption potentials built up for different curved geometries lead to qualitatively similar features . on the other hand ,",
    "it is suggested how an elementary hysteretic cycle could be constructed by filling and draining the cavity along paths determined by the critical points ( @xmath169 ) and ( @xmath181 ) .    in summary",
    ", we can state that the present work close successfully the application of the so called sfm for studying cc in pores exhibiting standard regular geometries , i.e. planar slits , cylindrical pores and spherical cavities .",
