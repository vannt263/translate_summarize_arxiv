    "isocyanic acid ( hnco ) was first detected towards sgr b2 @xcite and its rotational transitions have been found to be prominent towards the molecular clouds of the galactic center @xcite . since then , it has been observed towards dense cores associated with massive star formation @xcite , in the direction of tmc-1 @xcite , in diffuse clouds @xcite and in external galaxies @xcite .",
    "hence , isocyanic acid is found in a large variety of physical environments . in the 3 mm line survey",
    "we have performed in four dark cloud cores using the iram 30-m telescope @xcite we detected hnco in all the observed sources , showing that this species is a common constituent of dark clouds . while its abundance in dark and diffuse clouds is @xmath710@xmath6 @xcite , in hot cores , the galactic center clouds and in external galaxies it is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "hnco has several isomers with a singlet electronic state : hocn , hcno , honc , and hnoc .",
    "the chemical pathways leading to those isomers could be very different , since there is not an obvious common precursor .",
    "thus , their detection in space could provide some information on the chemistry of these species .",
    "unfortunately , only hnco and hcno have been fully characterized in the spectroscopic laboratories so far ( see below ) . in this letter",
    "we report on the first detection of fulminic acid , hcno , towards b1 , l1544 , l183 and l1527 .",
    "the observations were performed using the iram 30-m telescope ( granada , spain ) between 2002 december and 2007 february , and in 2008 july .",
    "we used two 3 mm sis receivers working simultaneously at the same frequency , but with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "both receivers were tuned in single sideband mode with image rejections @xmath924 db .",
    "system temperatures were @xmath9150 k , for the lowest frequencies and between 200250 k for the highest ones .",
    "the observations were done in frequency switching mode .",
    "the spectrometer was an autocorrelator with 40 khz of spectral resolution ( @xmath90.13 kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "intensity calibration was performed using two absorbers at different temperatures .",
    "the atmospheric opacity was obtained from the measurement of the sky emissivity and the use of the atm code @xcite .",
    "weather conditions were typically average summer conditions ( water vapor column @xmath95 mm and zenith opacities @xmath100.1 at 3 mm ) , except for the period in 2008 july when we had very good weather conditions ( @xmath112 mm of precipitable water and opacities @xmath90.03 ) .",
    "pointing and focus were checked , on strong and nearby sources , every 1.5 and 3 hours respectively . at the observed frequencies the beamwidth of the antenna is in the range @xmath12 and the main beam efficiency is @xmath13 .",
    "the sources being similar in size , or slightly larger , than the main beam of the telescope , the contribution of the error beam to the observed intensities is negligible and all the spectra have been calibrated in main beam temperature scale .",

    "corrections for beam dilution are applied for each line .",

    "is dominated by grain - surface chemistry which explains the large column density of hnco rather than ion - molecule and neutral - neutral gas phase reactions , the lack of hcno suggests that grain surface chemistry is not the main path to the production of hcno in molecular clouds ( see below ) .    from recent state of the art _ ab initio _ calculations ,",
    "the relative energies of hocn , hcno and honc , in their ground electronic singlet states , compared to hnco , are 24.7 , 70.7 and 84.1 kcal mol@xmath5 at an unprecedented level of accuracy @xcite .",

    "the relative abundance of the different isomers in molecular clouds depend on the chemical paths leading to their formation . unlike the case of hcn / hnc , which are mainly formed from the dissociative recombination of hcnh@xmath54 , there is not an obvious common parent molecule leading to the simultaneous formation of the various hnco isomers .",
    "the most evident formation path for hnco and hcno could be the reaction of hcnh@xmath54 with atomic oxygen and oh .",
    "unfortunately , it has been shown in the laboratory that hcnh@xmath54 does not react with oxygen @xcite and nothing is known about its reaction with oh . @xcite suggested the reaction nco@xmath54 + h@xmath0 @xmath1 hnco@xmath54 + h as a starting point for the chemistry of hnco .",
    "the other isomers can not be produced via this reaction as the corresponding channels are endothermic .",
    "we have introduced a tentative gas phase chemical network with the three most stable isomers hnco , hocn and hcno and their associated ions which have been studied theoretically by @xcite .",
    "we have obtained that the proton transfer reactions involving h@xmath55 and nco , the most stable isomer , could lead to both hcno@xmath54 and hocn@xmath54 via exothermic channels .",
    "the hnco@xmath54 , hcno@xmath54 and hocn@xmath54 ions can further react with molecular hydrogen , giving respectively h@xmath0nco@xmath54 , h@xmath0cno@xmath54 and hocnh@xmath54 , whose relative energies have been computed by @xcite .",
    "these ion - molecule reactions are followed by dissociative recombination where we assume that no chemical structural change occurs so that h@xmath0nco@xmath54/h@xmath0cno@xmath54 + e@xmath56 hnco / hcno + h , and hocnh@xmath54 + e@xmath56 hnco / hocn + h.      0.1 & 0.005 & 0.004 & 0.04 & 0.47 & 0.02 & 0.8 + 0.3 & 0.01 & 0.01 & 0.08 & 1.30 & 0.07 & 1.5 + 1.0 & 8.6 & 18 & 6.30 & 38.0 & 6.6 & 29 + 3.0 & 7.4 & 18 & 3.10 & 12.0 & 4.5 & 58 + 10 & 5.1 & 9.3 & 1.20 & 2.0 & 2.0 & 72 + 30 & 3.2 & 3.4 & 0.58 & 0.31 & 0.8 & 58 + 50 & 2.5 & 2.0 & 0.41 & 0.13 & 0.5 & 49 + 100 & 1.7 & 0.9 & 0.25 & 0.04 & 0.3 & 36 +    neutral - neutral reactions may also be at work .",
    "so , hnco can be formed by cn + o@xmath0 @xmath1 nco + o , followed by nco + h@xmath0 @xmath1 hnco + h , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however the presence of an activation barrier in the nco + h@xmath0 reaction can not be dismissed and a tentative barrier of 500 k is introduced in the present work . in addition , a favorable neutral - neutral pathway leading to the formation of hcno is provided by ch@xmath0 + no @xmath1 hcno + h , a reaction well studied in combustion and atmospheric chemistry @xcite , for which no activation barrier has been found by @xcite from _ ab initio _ studies .",
    "other neutral - neutral reactions of hcno in the presence of atomic oxygen and no may occur @xcite . including these various possibilities in a chemical network , we have computed equilibrium solutions by solving directly the steady state chemical equations .",
    "table  [ tab : model_abundances ] displays the fractional abundances relative to molecular hydrogen for different volume densities in cold clouds , at a temperature of 10 k and a cosmic ionization rate of 5@xmath57 s. these results do not differ considerably when assuming a temperature of 15 k and 20 k. the predicted abundance for no is in good agreement with the value observed in dark clouds @xcite .",
    "nco has also a large abundance , but due to its moderate dipole moment ( 0.67 d ) and a @xmath58 structure diluting the emission spectrum resulting from an enhanced partition function , the expected intensity from its rotational lines is rather weak . from our line survey of dark clouds",
    "@xcite we derive limits to its abundance of 1 - 5@xmath59 .",
    "the result from our models show a good agreement with the values observed for @xmath43 in dark clouds and low - mass star forming regions .",
    "it increases with volume density up to @xmath47(h@xmath0)=10@xmath60 @xmath61 , but decreases again when the density is larger than this value .",
    "it seems that for low and high volume density clouds fulminic acid could be rather abundant , while in clouds of moderate density , like tmc-1 , it will be much less abundant than isocyanic acid , hnco .",
    "furthermore tmc-1 shows a very peculiar chemistry , being a carbon rich source while it is deficient in oxygen bearing species",
    ". that could be the reason why hcno is detected in l183 , similar to tmc-1 in density and temperature but oxygen rich , and not towards tmc-1 .",
    "the formation of hnco on dust grains may also be very efficient @xcite and these surface chemistry processes could also lead to the formation of hcno ( herbst , private communication ) . however , the gas phase models predict abundances for hnco very close to those observed in dark clouds . moreover , these models also predict the observed hnco / hcno abundance ratio .",
    "the detection of the different isomers of hnco provides a fundamental information concerning the physical and chemical conditions , in particular the respective contribution of gas phase and grain processes in the chemistry since there is not an obvious common precursor for them .",
    "thus , the observation of the other isomer of hnco , hocn , for which present gas phase models predict a very low abundance in dark clouds could provide a good discrimination between gas and grain surface processes in dark clouds .",
    "the search for hnco isomers towards different environments would be the next step to further investigate their chemical production .",

    "<S> we report on the first detection in space of fulminic acid , hcno . </S>",
    "<S> this isomer of hnco has been observed in three starless cores , b1 , l1544 and l183 , and in the low mass star forming region l1527 with a measured abundance ratio of hnco / hcno between 40 - 70 . </S>",
    "<S> however , hcno was not detected towards the direction of the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 or towards the orion hot core region . </S>",
    "<S> the derived hnco / hcno abundance ratio in these cases is greater than 350 and 1000 in tmc-1 and orion , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ch@xmath0 + no @xmath1 hcno + h is a key reaction for the formation of fulminic acid . </S>",
    "<S> a value of 5.5@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath5 of the corresponding reaction rate coefficient , as given by @xcite , allows to reproduce the observed abundances of fulminic acid in both the observed dark clouds and low mass star forming core , where the determined abundance of hnco in these regions with respect to molecular hydrogen is 1 - 5@xmath210@xmath6 . </S>"
