    "the family of the rare - earth ( @xmath3 ) metallic nickel - borocarbides @xmath4 has been the subject of considerable recent attention due to the interplay of magnetic and superconducting properties.@xcite the critical temperature @xmath5 of these materials depends on the particular rare earth ( or their combination ) , or on material purity , and ranges from zero to about @xmath6k in nonmagnetic members such as @xmath7 .",
    "the vortex lattices ( vl ) in these compounds exhibit a variety of phases with changing magnetic field and temperature .",
    "studies of vl s are facilitated by availability of large high quality single crystals@xcite with a relatively large ginzburg - landau parameter , @xmath8 , low pinning , and a broad region of the @xmath9 phase diagram where the superconducting magnetic properties are nearly reversible .",
    "the structural phase transition from the triangular to square vl driven by the magnetic field is of a particular interest .",
    "a variety of experimental techniques are used to study this transition : small - angle neutron scattering ( sans)@xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite , and bitter decoration by small magnetic particles.@xcite the sans and stm methods require rather high magnetic fields ( few koe and higher ) , whereas decoration is commonly employed for fields on the order of several hundred oe or less because of a relatively low resolution .    for @xmath10 , the phase transition from the triangular to square vl in increasing field has been recorded by sans and complemented by decoration.@xcite decoration patterns revealed coexistence of the square and triangular lattices in fields near 600 oe . in @xmath0 crystals , the square vortex lattice for high magnetic fields of a few tesla has been seen in stm.@xcite no experiments in low magnetic fields were carried out for this material .",
    "the theoretical model , which describes most of the features of evolving vl s is based on the london theory corrected for nonlocal effects.@xcite    in this work the vl s in @xmath0 were studied by the decoration method . to cover the field range of greatest interest for the vl evolution",
    ", the method was extended up to fields of 1.5 koe , the field region unprecedented for the decoration technique in materials with @xmath11 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the maximum field at which the decoration has been attempted was @xmath12 oe on nb.@xcite",
    "we have used single crystals @xmath0 of the size @xmath135 mm in the @xmath14-plane and @xmath15 mm thick .",
    "the crystals were grown from @xmath16 flux , as described elsewhere.@xcite experiments were carried out in the field cooled regime with the field nominally parallel to the @xmath1 axis ( within a few degrees ) . for all fields except @xmath17oe , the temperature was set 4.2 k initially but may have risen to 7 - 9 k during the decoration experiment . for @xmath17oe ,",
    "the initial temperature was 1.5 k. to minimize effects of inhomogeneities and pinning , decorations were done on a particular location of the same sample which was cleared by acetone after each decoration . a scanning electron microscope was used to resolve decoration patterns on the sample surface and to determine vl orientations relative to the crystal by comparing decorations with electron channeling patterns ( ecp ) .",
    "routinely , the decoration experiments are done in fields near the lower critical field @xmath18 on samples as thin platelets in the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "since there is no quantitative theory to estimate the resolution limit , we use the following qualitative guidelines in pushing the method to higher fields :    \\1 .",
    "the size of magnetic particles should be small relative to the london penetration depth @xmath19 and to the intervortex spacing @xmath20 .",
    "the density of particles should be small to avoid clustering .",
    "the field gradients due to vl s should be large enough for the interaction with the particle magnetic moment @xmath21 to exceed the thermal energy , @xmath22.@xcite    the first condition is realized by manipulation of the buffer helium pressure within @xmath23torr . the optimal size of particles of @xmath24 nm should not limit the resolution up to fields @xmath25koe .",
    "the second requirement is met by empirically minimizing the quantity of the evaporated magnetic material and by varying the distance between the heater and the sample .",
    "the most difficult to control and to satisfy is the last condition because the magnetic moment @xmath21 of iron particles is unknown . besides",
    ", the actual temperature of decoration is uncertain because of the heating during the iron evaporation .",
    "still , one has to keep this @xmath26 as low as possible . to achieve this",
    ", we used onset temperatures @xmath27k for decoration in high fields . in this work",
    ", we have found that the contrast images of decorated vl s in @xmath0 can be readily resolved in fields up to 1480 oe .",
    "the information one can extract from decoration experiments in fields below @xmath18 differs from the case @xmath28 . in the first case",
    ", the intervortex distance exceeds the penetration depth @xmath29 , and one can well resolve single vortices .",
    "however , the intervortex interaction in this situation is too weak to arrange vortices in a well ordered lattice , given the competition with disordering pinning .",
    "nevertheless , one can utilize the decoration data to obtain a rough estimate of the penetration depth .",
    "the field distribution of a single vortex in the bulk has a characteristic diameter of 2@xmath29 .",
    "near the sample surface the vortex field  opens up\".@xcite as a result , the field gradients at the sample surface are lower than in the bulk .",
    "the field lines at a distance @xmath29 from the vortex core in the bulk , cross the surface at a larger distance from the core .",
    "one may consider the magnetic diameter of the vortex at the surface as @xmath30 , where the empirical expansion factor @xmath31 can be determined measuring the size @xmath32 of the iron particle clusters forming at each vortex site during the low field decoration .",
    "data show that @xmath33 provides a good estimate of @xmath29 .    in applied fields well above @xmath18 , the fields of neighboring vortices overlap , and the resolution of decoration experiments drops .",
    "nevertheless , the contrast of the decoration patterns still provides enough quantitative information on the vl symmetry and intervortex spacing .",
    "the computer processing of the images ( fast fourier transform and image filtering followed by inverse fourier transform ) greatly enhance our ability to study vl s and the domain structures in fields which were thought inaccessible to the decoration technique .",
    "in this work , vl s were successfully decorated and analyzed in a broad field interval from 4 to 1480 oe .",
    "as is seen in fig . [ 4oe ] , in small fields vortices do not form a well ordered lattice .",
    "a straightforward count shows that the average intervortex spacing corresponds to one flux quantum per vortex .",
    "high magnification images of single vortices reveal the average size of the iron clusters of about 600 nm . taking this as an estimate of @xmath34 at @xmath35",
    ", we obtain @xmath36 nm utilizing the two - fluid approximation @xmath37 .",
    "this value is larger than @xmath38 nm obtained from the @xmath18 data,@xcite and @xmath39 nm ( ref . )",
    "obtained from the magnetization measurements , but close to the estimate of ref . .",

    "oe we observe domains of nearly regular triangular vl s ; see fig .",
    "vl orientations within each domain are quite random",
    ". typical size of a domain is a few intervortex distances and increases with the magnetic field .",
    "an example of vl at @xmath41oe is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ domains ] .",
    "the fourier transform ( ft ) of this pattern shows that the structure consists of three nearly regular triangular domains with different vl orientations .",
    "= .8    by choosing the ft maxima which belong to one of the domains and clearing all other reflexes one can obtain with the help of the inverse ft the patterns of all three domains in real space separately .",
    "these patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ dom3 ] .",
    "= .8    note that the domain size ( in units of intervortex distance ) for 200 oe is large as compared to domains in the field of 40 oe .",
    "the influence of crystal inhomogeneities and anisotropy on the vl domain structure and ordering has been extensively studied for @xmath42.@xcite the nonlocality brings a new complexity to the process of domain formation because vl s now depend on @xmath43 and the local mean - free path.@xcite comparing the ecp picture of fig .",
    "[ ecp ] with figs .",
    "[ dom3 ] , we find that one of the closepacked directions on the upper panel is aligned with @xmath44 direction of the crystal , whereas that of the middle panel is aligned with @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth noting that the model of ref .",
    "predicts that the short diagonal of the rhombic vl cell in small fields should point in one of these directions .",
    "= .9    in fields",
    "more then 200 oe , the typical domain size considerably exceeds the intervortex distance .",
    "the orientation of the closepacked vl direction in most domains correlates ( within few degrees ) with @xmath46 crystallographic direction ; this is seen in fig . [ 300oe ] in which the decoration pattern for @xmath47oe and the ecp picture are provided .    still , in other domains the closepacked direction coincides with @xmath48110@xmath49 , the fraction of which decreases with field and at @xmath50oe reaches @xmath51 .",
    "the vl unit cell is nearly rhombic with the apex angle @xmath52 exceeding @xmath53 , as can be extracted from the ft in fig .",
    "[ 710oe ] .",
    "the angle @xmath52 increases with field .",
    "the preferable orientation of the vl corresponds to the unit cell diagonal opposite to @xmath52 being aligned with @xmath48100@xmath49 .    in fields of about 600 oe and higher , in some surface locations",
    "we observe domains of the square vl , whereas majority of the domains contain strongly distorted triangular ( or , better to say , rhombic ) vl , see ft in fig .",
    "[ 710oe ] . the fraction of domains with the square lattice increases with increasing field .",
    "a similar situation has been seen in sans data on @xmath54 , where the presence of domains was deduced from analysis of the scattering maxima.@xcite here , we see the domains directly .",
    "= .8    = .8    = .8    the square domains are dominant in fields of about 1000 oe and higher , fig .",
    "[ 1480oe ] .",
    "the square diagonals are parallel to @xmath55 and @xmath56 crystallographic direction .",
    "= .85    the results of our study of vl s in @xmath0 for a two particular locations on the crystal surface are collected in fig .",
    "[ ngraph ] where the field dependence of the angle @xmath52 is shown .",
    "the triangles and circles show the decoration results from two different locations of the crystal .",
    "few points for the same field indicate the scattering of the angle @xmath52 within the decoration area of about @xmath57 m . in the field interval 200 - 600",
    "oe , the apex angle @xmath52 of the rhombic unit cell slowly increases with field . with the further field increase ,",
    "vl s deviate even faster from the standard triangular vl ( with @xmath58 ) toward larger apex angles ( @xmath52 exceeds @xmath59 ) and in many decorations coexistence of domains with triangular and nearly square vl s are observed .",
    "the theory of ref . predicts that in fields less than @xmath60oe along @xmath61 crystal direction , the vl should have a rhombic unit cell with a short diagonal along either @xmath44 or @xmath62 .",
    "the apex angle @xmath52 of the rhombus should be less than @xmath53 .",
    "experimentally , up to fields about 200 oe we did not record a well ordered vl . instead , a structure made of many domains with different lattice orientations is observed .",
    "the prediction for the value of @xmath63 is also hard to verify in this field region .",
    "one can argue that in small fields energy differences between different possible vl configurations are comparable with characteristic pinning energies . in this situation , the vl structure",
    "is affected by distribution of pinning sites which may vary throughout the sample .",
    "therefore , we need better crystals of @xmath0 to support or disprove the low field theoretical scenario for equilibrium vl s for this material ( for @xmath64 this scenario has been confirmed@xcite by sans data in fields up to 1200 oe ) .    still , the low field decoration results can be used to estimate the london penetration depth @xmath29 at decoration temperatures of @xmath65 .",
    "the value of @xmath29 obtained by measuring sizes of the particle clusters , is in a reasonable agreement with values obtained by other techniques.@xcite it is to be noted that @xmath29 estimated by measuring the `` vortex diameter '' @xmath66 in decoration experiments is in a fair agreement with other data also for ybco,@xcite for which an empiric relation @xmath67 yields @xmath68 nm and for nbse@xmath69 for which the procedure gives @xmath70nm.@xcite    with the magnetic field increasing , the role of pinning diminishes because the intervortex interactions become stronger .",
    "the field region with @xmath71 exceeding approximately 300 oe is more amenable for checking the theoretical model of ref . .",
    "the model is based on the nonlocal london approach and as such requires a number of microscopic input parameters ( the fermi surface , the penetration depth , the mean - free path , to name a few ) for a quantitative comparison with experiment . here",
    ", we use a simpler  mean - field \" approach based on the assumption that the structural transition from the rhombic to the square vl at the transition field we call @xmath72 is of the second order .",
    "this assumption is supported by numerical simulations of ref . which show that the rhombus - to - square transition at @xmath72 is accomplished by an infinitesimal deformation so that at the transition the structure changes continuously .",
    "moreover , the square phase has an extra symmetry element : the 4-fold rotation axis which is absent in the rhombic cell . both of these features are characteristic of a 2nd order transition .",
    "we , therefore , can apply the general landau theory according to which the energy density near the transition at @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is the part unrelated to the vl structure ; the magnetic induction @xmath75 for platelet - like samples is equal to the perpendicular applied field @xmath71 .",
    "the field independent and positive coefficients @xmath76 are related to a particular vl ; @xmath77 is a properly defined order parameter which should be zero in equilibrium above @xmath72 . since the apex angle of the high - field structure is @xmath78 , one can choose @xmath79 . note that the field @xmath75 in ( [ f ] ) plays the role of temperature in the standard landau theory .",
    "the equilibrium structure corresponds to @xmath80 which yields @xmath81 above @xmath72 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "the two signs correspond to two possible structures with apex angles @xmath84 ; these are rhombic vl s rotated relative to each other by @xmath78 .",
    "we then expect @xmath85 near @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the numerical simulations show that with good accuracy this dependence holds all the way down to small fields where @xmath52 should approach @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the apex angle @xmath52 ( in degrees ) should satisfy an approximate relation @xmath88 in a broad field domain near @xmath72 .",
    "this formula is convenient for comparison with data since it contains only one fitting parameter @xmath72 .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ ngraph ] is calculated with the help of eq .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) with @xmath89 oe .",
    "there are few reasons for a considerable spread of @xmath52 values shown in fig .",
    "[ ngraph ] .",
    "since the lattice should undergo restructuring during the cooling , the cooling rate may affect the resulting structure . the gas pressure may influence the actual decoration temperature since during the  evaporation `` of iron particles the sample heats up and cools down with the pressure dependent rate . clearly , the spread related to different loci is related to crystal inhomogeneities .",
    "moreover , the nonlocal london model predicts@xcite and the data@xcite confirm that the transition field @xmath72 is sensitive to the crystal purity ( _ via _ the mean - free path @xmath90 ) .",
    "even weak inhomogeneities in @xmath90 within one decoration patch of @xmath57m@xmath91 may influence vl structures . as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) , @xmath92 diverges as @xmath93 , in other words , a small spread in values of @xmath72 may cause a considerable variation in @xmath52 .",
    "this statement can also be formulated as enhanced ' ' structural fluctuations \" near the second order transition at @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , our data show that the @xmath52 spread peaks in the field interval @xmath94oe , i.e. , just near @xmath72 .",
