    "+ if one creates a macroscopic superposition , it is useful to have a measure of its ` quantumness ' or lack thereof .",
    "various such measures have been proposed in the literature ( for a review see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "another significant measure of quantumness is quantum correlation , an important instance of which is entanglement , whereby superposed states of one quantum system are entangled with the superposed states of another .",
    "various measures of quantum correlation , which quantify the extent of departure from classicality , have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "one such measure , quantum discord @xcite , is the subject of the present paper .",

    ", this is an example of macroscopic quantum behaviour , and it is important to ask how this observation constrains the parameters of collapse models such as continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) @xcite which predict breakdown of superposition in macroscopic systems .",
    "this study has been recently carried out in @xcite and it has been found that the csl parameters are only weakly constrained by this experiment , with stronger bounds coming from matter wave interferometry , spontaneous x - ray emission , and millikelvin - cooled nanocantilevers ( see @xcite and especially fig . 3 therein ) .",
    "the two phenomenological parameters of csl are the rate constant @xmath1 which determines the rate of spontaneous collapse , and the physical length scale @xmath2 to which the collapsing wave - function gets confined .",

    "we ask a similar question also for fundamental gravity induced decoherence . as done in @xcite , here",
    "also we try to put bounds on csl parameters using quantum discord and show that these two studies are consistent .",

    "we have also shown the allowed @xmath8 parameter space as obtained from this experiment .",
    "in the context of quantum information theory , quantum discord is a measure of the quantumness or non - classicality between two bipartite subsystems of a quantum system .",
    "it was first introduced by the authors in @xcite and @xcite , where they showed that the vanishing of discord can be considered as a criterion for determining the pointer states of a system .",
    "mathematically , quantum discord is defined in terms of the difference between two measures of mutual information between two subsystems , which coincide for classical correlations .",
    "as we know from quantum information theory , the quantum correlation / mutual information between two subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the von - neumann entropies for the subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the joint quantum entropy for the whole system .",
    "the general definition for von - neumann entropy for any system with density matrix @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 are the eigenvalues of @xmath15 .",
    "an alternative definition of mutual information between two subsystems is obtained as a result of the information gained about one subsystem due to the measurement on the other subsystem .",
    "let us imagine measuring an observable of the subsystem @xmath10 through the projection operator @xmath18 .",
    "under such a scenario , the mutual information between the two subsystems can be mathematically expressed as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the conditional quantum entropy of @xmath9 for a given state of @xmath10 . here , @xmath21 in eq .",
    ", @xmath22 is the projection operator which is used to perform a measurement on the subsystem @xmath10 and @xmath23 represents the different outcomes of this measurement .",
    "classically , using bayes theorem , these two measures of information are identical . however , for quantum systems , this need not be true .",
    "the deviation from this equality gives the measure of quantum discord as defined below : @xmath24",
    "@xmath25 corresponds to classical subsystems and @xmath26 shows the presence of quantum correlation between two subsystems . in general , discord is asymmetric under the interchange of the systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but in our present work the two subsystems are identical .",
    "our analysis is based on the experiment reported in @xcite where the authors created an entanglement between two macroscopic diamond pieces separated by a large distance ( @xmath27 cm ) at room temperature and verified that this entanglement is preserved during the experimental time ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the idea is to excite phonon modes within the two diamond crystals using raman scattering such that the phonon modes of the two spatially separated crystals become entangled .",
    "these phonon modes are actually macroscopic and thus preserving the quantum entanglement between these modes ensures the presence of entanglement in the macro regime .",
    "the experimental set - up consists of a source generating ultra - short optical pulses which are used to excite or de - excite phonon modes within the crystal via the emission of stokes or anti - stokes photons respectively .",
    "the pulse ( also called the pump pulse ) is split into two parts using a @xmath29 beam - splitter and sent to the two crystals ( denoted by ",
    "l \" and  r \" ) simultaneously to create an entanglement between the two crystals .",
    "this entire process generates two stokes modes at the two crystals which are then made to interfere with a phase difference @xmath30 created using a half - wave plate and a polarizer .",
    "the interfered stokes modes are detected at the detector .",
    "thus , detection of stokes photons at the detector indicates the fact that the two crystals are now entangled . to verify that this entanglement is preserved until environmental decoherence effects destroy the entanglement , a second pulse , known as the probe pulse ,",
    "is sent to each of the crystals simultaneously again using the @xmath29 beam splitter . due to the interaction with this probe pulse ,",
    "some of the excited phonon modes within the crystals get de - excited to the ground state resulting in an emission of anti - stokes photons .",
    "finally , these anti - stokes photons , coming out from the l and r crystals , are also made to interfere in a similar manner with a phase difference @xmath31 and detected at another detector .",
    "thus , by detecting stokes and anti - stokes photons at the two detectors , one concludes that a macroscopic entanglement is created and preserved within the time scale of the experiment . for a more detailed description of the experiment , one may refer to @xcite .",
    "the excited phonon modes induce displacements of the atoms within the crystals such that two neighbouring atoms oscillate in the opposite directions (  out of phase \" oscillation ) , thus creating two counter - oscillating sublattices within each crystal .",
    "we denote @xmath32 as the state when no phonon modes are excited .",
    "thus , @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the ground states of l and r crystals respectively and @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the excited phonon states of l and r crystals respectively .",
    "the basis for the entangled system is thus : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    "originally proposed by @xcite , csl modifies quantum mechanics to include an anti - hermitian , norm - preserving , stochastic and non - linear component in the schrdinger equation .",
