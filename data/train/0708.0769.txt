    "in the last few years there has a growing interest in accurate parameterizations for fragmentation functions driven by the increasing role of one particle inclusive measurements as tools able to provide valuable information on many subjects , including the spin and flavor structure of the nucleon , nuclear modifications of parton densities and fragmentation functions , and in general , as a window to the non - perturbative regime , much more incisive than totally inclusive measurements .    in this context , parametrizations for fragmentation functions have been extracted , however , mostly based on single inclusive electron - positron annihilation measurements .",
    "these data give per se no information on how to disentangle quark from anti - quark fragmentation , and fixes mainly the flavor singlet combinations of fragmentation functions at intermediate hadron energy fractions .",
    "the gluon fragmentation is also not exceedingly well constrained , since its contribution enter as a higher order correction , and the scale dependence is too weak to determine it .    in the following",
    "we very briefly summarize results from a global analysis where we have determined individual fragmentation functions for quark and anti - quarks for all flavors , as well as gluons , from a much larger set of data @xcite .",
    "the addition of semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and proton - proton collisions measurements not only increases statistics , but have the advantages of charge discriminated final states , different ranges for the scale and energy fractions , and different sensitivity to the partonic species .",
    "in order to have the flexibility required by charge separated distributions and to accommodate the additional data , we adopt a somewhat more versatile functional form for the input distributions than in previous extractions of fragmentation functions @xcite @xmath0 } , \\ ] ] where the initial scale @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff - input ] ) is taken to be @xmath2 for the lighter partons and the quark masses for the heavier ones . to reduce the number of parameters to those that can be effectively constrained by the data ,",
    "we are forced to make some plausible assumptions ; for example we impose isospin symmetry for the sea fragmentation functions in the case of pions , i.e. @xmath3 , but we allow for slightly different normalizations in the @xmath4 sum : @xmath5 . for strange quarks it is assumed that @xmath6 .",
    "similar assumptions are made in the case of kaons , protons , and the remaining charged hadrons .",
