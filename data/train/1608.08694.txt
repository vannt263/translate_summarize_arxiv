    "the central molecular zone ( cmz ) of the galaxy is a highly concentrated region of interstellar molecular gas , located within about a 200-pc radius from the galactic center ( gc ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular gas in the cmz is characterized by the large mass ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) , large velocity dispersion ( typical line width @xmath12 1020 km s@xmath13 ) , high number densities ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , and high temperatures .",
    "these characteristics have been shown by various molecular line observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) including ammonia ( nh@xmath0 ) inversion - lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "meta - stable ( @xmath16 ) inversion - lines of nh@xmath0 have been often referred to as an `` interstellar thermometer '' , because intensity ratios between the lines reflect the kinetic temperature with tiny influence of variation of the number density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the critical densities are not very high even at levels up to @xmath17 whose excitation energy is about 2000 k [ e.g. assuming hot gas ( @xmath18 k ) , @xmath19 @xmath15 , @xcite ] .",
    "therefore , the intensity ratios are the most reliable and powerful probe of interstellar molecular gas temperature in very wide temperature range .",
    "several nh@xmath0 observations have been made in the cmz .",
    "first , long - scan observations along the galactic longitude were made by morris et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , revealing that warm temperature ( rotational temperature , @xmath20@xmath21 k ) is common in the region .",
    "one of the most important reports was made by hettemeister et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who observed the six lowest meta - stable lines toward 36 cloud cores in the cmz , and showed that there are two temperature components , cold and warm , in all the clouds .",
    "the cold component ( @xmath22 k ) seems to be dense ( @xmath23 @xmath15 ) and thermally coupled with dust ( @xmath241420 k , @xcite ) , while the warm component ( @xmath25 k ) seems to be less dense ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "large - scale mapping observations were carried out recently by nagayama et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) and purcell et al .",
    "nagayama et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) argued that the envelopes of molecular clouds are hotter than the insides and the ortho - para ratio ( opr ) is high in the cmz ( @xmath261.53.5 ) .",
    "extremely hot nh@xmath0 excited up to @xmath27 was detected toward the core region of sgr b2 as absorption lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "mills and morris ( 2013 ) detected nh@xmath0 @xmath28@xmath29 lines toward 15 cloud centers , revealing that hot ( over 200300 k ) molecular gas exists in various places in the cmz .",
    "similar warm ( or hot ) gas was also discovered by other line observations , such as h@xmath30 emissions ( @xcite ) , h@xmath31 absorption lines ( @xcite ) , and h@xmath0o@xmath32 absorption lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "their distributions , however , remain unrevealed .",
    "warm or hot gas is likely to be ubiquitous in the cmz .",
    "heating of molecular gas by dust , however , does not work in this region , because the temperature of the warm component is significantly higher than that of dust ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several other candidates for the heating mechanism have been proposed ; mainly , ( 1 ) x - ray heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 2 ) cosmic ray heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 3 ) dissipation of supersonic turbulence produced by shock phenomena ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanisms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) appear insufficient to heat the ubiquitous hot component with moderately intense x - ray ( flux density , @xmath33 erg @xmath34 s@xmath13 , @xcite ) and cosmic - ray ( ionization rate , @xmath35 a few 10@xmath36 s@xmath13 , @xcite ) in the gc .",
    "on the other hand , several studies estimated that heating via shock phenomena can be attributed to the heat mechanism of molecular gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "sources of shocks have been observationally proposed in this region so far : ( 1 ) supernova or hypernova explosions ( e.g. @xcite ) , ( 2 ) collisions between molecular clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "collisions of molecular gas may be partly due to the barred potential of the galaxy ( @xcite ) , or magnetic fields such as parker instability ( @xcite ) . to study how these shocks contribute to the heating , investigation of the distribution and morphology of warm / hot molecular gas is intrinsically important .",
    "we mapped nh@xmath0 meta - stable inversion - lines @xmath1@xmath2 simultaneously in the cmz with the tsukuba 32-m telescope owned by the geospatial information authority of japan ( gsi ) . in this paper , we describe observations , data analysis process , and present measured data",

    "<S> these line ratios correspond to diversity of rotational temperature , which results from mixing of the two temperature components . </S>"
