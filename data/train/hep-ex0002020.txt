    "the possibility to apply successfully frequentist statistics to problematic cases in frontier research has received a fundamental contribution with the proposal of the unified approach by feldman and cousins @xcite .",
    "the unified approach uses neyman s method @xcite to construct a confidence belt that guarantees the derivation of confidence intervals with a correct frequentist coverage ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the unified approach allows to obtain an automatic transition from two - sided confidence intervals to upper limits in the case of negative results , preserving the property of a correct frequentist coverage .",
    "several works have followed the unified approach paper discussing alternative methods to construct the confidence belt .",
    "hence , at present several frequentist methods with interesting properties are available and under discussion .",
    "their performances are also often compared with those of the bayesian theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we define some appropriate statistical quantities that could help to decide which is the most appropriate method to use in order to obtain confidence intervals with the desired level of physical significance ( see also ref .",
    "we also define the sensitivity of an experiment to a signal .",
    "the physical significance of a confidence interval is its degree of reliability , which is very important , because scientists use confidence intervals provided by experiments or specialized compilations ( for example , the review of particle physics @xcite ) as inputs for their calculations .",
    "unreliable confidence intervals may lead to wrong or hazardous conclusions .    in section  [ exclusion ]",
    "we consider the expectation value of the upper limit in absence of a signal ( that we propose to call _ `` exclusion potential '' _ ) and its standard deviation . in sections  [ detection ] and [ sensitivity ]",
    "we discuss the possibility to calculate the expectation value ( _ `` upper and lower detection functions '' _ ) and the standard deviation of the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval produced by an experiment in the presence of a signal and we propose an appropriate definition of the _ `` sensitivity '' _ of an experiment to the signal searched for .    in this article",
    "we consider explicitly the case of a poisson process with known background in the framework of frequentist and bayesian statistical theories , but similar considerations apply also to the case of a gaussian distribution with boundary .",
    "an important quantity introduced by feldman and cousins @xcite is the average upper limit for the signal @xmath0 that would be obtained by an ensemble of experiments if @xmath1 ( in the case of a poisson process with known background , `` the average upper limit that would be obtained by an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no true signal '' ) .",
    "they called this quantity _",
    "`` sensitivity '' _ , but we think that this name is quite misleading , because it gives the impression that this quantity represents the expected capability of the experiment to reveal a true signal . , not when @xmath1 . ] instead , the true signal is assumed to be absent .",
    "hence , it is clear that the quantity under consideration does not represent the sensitivity of the experiment to the signal that is searched for , but it represents the expected upper limit for @xmath0 that will be obtained if there is no signal .",
    "therefore , we propose to call this quantity _ _ `` exclusion potential '' _ _ , a name that we will use in the following . as a further justification of this name , we note that in the case of neutrino oscillation experiments the exclusion potential",
    "is associated with the so - called `` exclusion curves '' in the space of the neutrino mixing parameters .    in the case of a poisson process with known background",
    "the exclusion potential is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of counts , @xmath4 is the expected mean background , @xmath0 is the mean true signal , @xmath5 is the poisson p.d.f . for the process and",
    "@xmath6 is the upper limit of the @xmath7 confidence interval for @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath3 counts .",
    "the exclusion potential @xmath8 depends on the values of the upper limits @xmath6 , which are different in the different methods for calculating the confidence belt .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above definition of exclusion potential can be extended to the results obtained with the bayesian theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) if @xmath9 is interpreted as the upper limit of the bayesian credibility interval for @xmath0 . in the following",
    "we will consider the bayesian theory assuming a flat prior and shortest credibility intervals for @xmath0 . in this case the posterior p.d.f .",

    "[ exposigma ] and [ exporange ] is that one can easily transform @xmath9 and @xmath8 in the physical quantity of interest , presenting the result only in terms of physical quantities .",

    "we obtain @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and with the bayesian theory ( with a flat prior and shortest credibility intervals ) we have @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "let us define the pull of a null result as @xmath63 if @xmath64 , the experimental upper limit @xmath9 is significantly weaker than the exclusion potential @xmath8 and may be considered as a weak indication that a signal may be present ( @xmath65 ) . on the other hand , if @xmath66 and there is no doubt on the value of the mean background @xmath4 , it means that the experiment has experienced an unlikely low fluctuation of the background and the resulting upper bound , that is significantly more stringent than the exclusion potential , is not reliable from a physical point of view and it is likely to increase if the experiment is continued ( a quite undesirable behavior ) , as shown by the example of the karmen experiment ( see fig .  4 of ref .",
    "moreover , a method that gives values of the pull closer to zero produces upper bounds that are more reliable from a physical point of view .",
    "for example , in the case of the heidelberg - moscow double - beta decay experiment @xcite , we have @xmath36 , @xmath25 and @xmath21 , giving @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the unified approach , @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the bayesian ordering method , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the bayesian theory with a flat prior and shortest credibility intervals .",
    "hence , among the two frequentist methods that we have considered , the upper bound obtained with bayesian ordering is slightly more reliable , from a physical point of view , than the one obtained with the unified approach .",
    "if one is willing to accept the bayesian theory , the corresponding upper bound is clearly the most reliable one from a physical point of view .",
    "let us point out that the knowledge of the possible fluctuation of the upper bound @xmath9 with respect to the exclusion potential @xmath8 can also help to _ decide , before looking at the data , which is the most appropriate frequentist method for the statistical analysis_.    this can be understood comparing , for example , figs .",
    "[ exporange]a and [ exporange]b , obtained with two frequentist methods with correct coverage .",
    "one can see that the upper dashed lines in the two figures almost coincide and the exclusion potential is slightly lower in the unified approach , with a difference going from 0.30 for @xmath73 to 0.73 for @xmath74 , with a relative difference of 89% .",
    "on the other hand , the lower dashed lines and the dotted lines obtained with the bayesian ordering are significantly higher than those obtained with the unified approach .",
    "the difference of the lower dashed lines , goes from 0.43 for @xmath73 to 1.40 for @xmath74 , with a relative difference going from 27% to 64% .",
    "the difference between the lowest possible values of @xmath9 ( dotted lines ) is quite large : for @xmath75 the lowest possible values of @xmath9 is about 0.8 in the unified approach and about 1.8 in the bayesian ordering method , more than twice !",
    "hence , if one does not want to risk to have to present a very stringent limit , which would be statistically correct but physically misleading , in the case of observation of less events than the expected background , one can look at figures like figs .",
    "[ exporange]a and [ exporange]b and the corresponding ones for other frequentist methods and decide which is the method more suitable for his tastes .",
    "let us emphasize that this choice _ must be done before looking at the data_. if one chooses the statistical method on the basis of the data , the property of coverage is lost .",
    "furthermore , the exclusion potential of an experiment can be calculated and published before starting the experiment or before the data are known , in order to have an indication of the excluded region that will be obtained in the case of absence of a signal ( or a signal much smaller than the expected background ) .",
    "we think that it would be useful to publish together with the exclusion potential also the standard deviation of the upper limit in the absence of a signal , in order to illustrate the possible fluctuations of the excluded region and to give , at the same time , a quantitative statement on the precision of the experiment .",
    "the exclusion potential and the standard deviation of the upper limit in the absence of a signal are interesting quantities , but they give only information on the possible experimental result in the worst - case scenario , that in which the signal is absent or so small to be undetectable .",
    "usually researchers are more interested in finding positive signals .",
