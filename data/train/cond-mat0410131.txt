    "ultracold atomic gases provide an experimental playground for testing pairing phenomena , due to the ability to control the inter - atomic interactions via a magnetically - tuned feshbach resonance @xcite . over the past year",
    ", tremendous progress has been made in realizing the crossover from the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of diatomic molecules to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) limit of weakly - bound cooper pairs in ultracold gases of fermionic atoms  @xcite .",
    "but there is much debate over where the crossover between the bcs and bec regimes occurs , following recent experimental studies on fermionic condensates @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is timely to perform a thorough theoretical investigation of what the signature of the crossover is and how it might be observed experimentally , using a realistic potential with a finite range .",
    "much of the theoretical work on systems of two types of fermions interacting via an adjustable , attractive potential have focussed on interactions that are governed by a single parameter , namely the s - wave scattering length  @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such a description is valid provided we have @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the width of the potential and @xmath4 is the fermi momentum of the non - interacting system , so that the only independent dimensionless variable in the problem is @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is only applicable to dilute systems like the ultracold atomic gases , not the high density situation found in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "the potential supports a 2-body bound state for @xmath6 , but this molecular state passes through zero energy and vanishes into the continuum at @xmath7 , the position of the feshbach resonance . as such",
    ", the bcs and bec limits correspond to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the distinction between the bec and bcs regimes can be made sharper  @xcite : the qualitative boundary between the bcs and bec ground states occurs when the chemical potential @xmath10 reaches @xmath11 , marking the disappearance of a fermi surface , and this coincides with the appearance of a bound state at @xmath7 only when the density is zero . at the point where",
    "there is no longer a defined fermi surface , there are qualitative changes in the quasi - particle excitation spectrum : the momentum corresponding to the minimum in the excitation spectrum shifts from finite momentum in the bcs limit to zero momentum in the bec limit . at the same point , the value of the excitation gap goes from @xmath12 in the bcs limit to @xmath13 in the bec limit , where @xmath12 is the gap parameter .",
    "we shall use these changes in the excitation spectrum as the  definition \" of the crossover point .",
    "there have also been studies of the bcs - bec crossover using coulomb potentials in the context of excitons @xcite . here ,",
    "the interaction is kept fixed and the density varied to achieve a smooth transition from the high density bcs limit to the dilute bec limit . note that it is not possible to obtain a density - driven crossover using an interaction that is only characterized by the scattering length , since this picture breaks down at high densities .    in this paper , we shall study the bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature using a realistic gaussian potential and compare with results from single - parameter potentials .",
    "we use a mean - field variational wave function to describe the crossover , which is expected to give an accurate description of the low temperature behavior , though not , of course , the finite temperature transition .    the paper is organized as follows : we describe the model and variational scheme in sec .",

    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote momentum variables and spin states @xmath18 , respectively , and @xmath19 .",
    "since experiments on atomic gases are carried out at low energies , we will restrict ourselves to the simple case of an _ s_-wave pairing interaction .",
    "we calculate the ground state by minimizing the free energy @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total number operator and @xmath10 is the chemical potential .",
    "the standard bcs variational wave function is given by @xmath22 and it smoothly interpolates from the bcs to bec limits , giving an accurate description of the crossover . here ,",

    "the scattering length re - emerges from positive infinity .",
    "note that this procedure does not keep the _ effective _ range @xmath34 of the potential fixed . in the low - energy limit ,",
    "the effective range @xmath34 , like the scattering length  @xmath0 , can be determined from the phase shift @xmath45 and is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",

    "the appearance of the minimum in the quasi - particle excitation spectrum at non - zero momentum is clearly evident in the quasi - particle density of states . as a function of momentum ,",
    "the density of states is defined as @xmath48 thus , @xmath49 is singular whenever there is a stationary point in the excitation spectrum ( @xmath50 ) , except when @xmath51 , where @xmath49 vanishes provided @xmath52 no faster than @xmath53 .",

    "thus , the bcs - bec crossover is the point at which a spike first appears as we decrease @xmath57",

    "recently , accurate calculations based on the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method  @xcite , have lowered the upper - bound on this result to ( @xmath93 ) , which shows that beyond mean - field effects account for at least a 25% improvement in the binding energy over the mean - field result .",

    "not surprisingly , the numerical @xmath86 approaches the universal curve as scattering length increases , and we require @xmath94 before @xmath86 touches the universal curve .",
    "furthermore , we see that no matter how large we make @xmath0 , the universal curve breaks down in the region sufficiently close to @xmath95 .",

    "in this paper we have performed a study of the bcs - bec crossover , at zero temperature , in the single - channel model , using a realistic effective interaction . in the mean - field approximation",
    "the crossover is described using a variational wave function , which interpolates smoothly between the bec and bcs limits .",
    "we find that the crossover point always lies on the side of the feshbach resonance where a molecular bound state exists at zero density , and that it converges to that of a single - parameter potential in the low density limit .",
    "moreover , our results reproduce the usual leggett picture in the limit of a dilute fermi gas , as expected . by using a potential of finite range , we have shown that the crossover for typical experimental parameters in ultracold atomic fermi gases can be described by a zero - range , single - parameter potential .",
    "we emphasize that a clear signature of the crossover point appears in the density of states , which could be measured spectroscopically  @xcite .",
    "the mean - field description of the single - channel model presented here is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "as described above , recent gfmc results provide an upper value for the energy density in the dilute limit ( @xmath92 ) , which represents a 25% improvement over the leggett limit .",
    "therefore , additional work is required in order to include next - to - leading order effects in a quantitative way , and study the changes ( or lack thereof ) in the features of the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "approximations schemes based on the two - particle irreducible effective action  @xcite are readily available in quantum field theory where they have been recently employed to describe the dynamics of a system out of equilibrium , and the dynamics of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "work is currently under way in order to apply such methods to the study of the bec - bcs crossover based on the hamiltonian  .",
    "the single - channel model is of course a simplification of detailed models for the feshbach resonance which include the resonance explicitly , either as a boson ( the fermi - bose model  @xcite ) or more generally as three - level   @xcite or four - level fermi systems . the fermi - bose model , as well as models with even numbers of fermions , all have large regimes of parameter space where the resonance is sufficiently detuned from the open channel that high energy degrees of freedom can be integrated out in favor of an effective interaction between two species , recovering the model discussed in this paper .",
    "close enough to resonance the detailed fermionic structure of the resonance may become important .",
    "models where the feshbach bound state shares a state with the open channel ( relevant to @xmath100 ) are different , and do not reduce to an effective single channel model in a simple way@xcite . in future work",
    ", we will compare and contrast these different models  @xcite using a generalization of the variational scheme given in this paper .",
