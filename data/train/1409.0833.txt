    "the concept of quantum teleportation was introduced by bennett _ _ _ _ et al_. _ in 1993 @xcite . in teleportation",
    "an unknown quantum state is transmitted from a sender ( alice ) to a receiver ( bob ) by using a shared entanglement and two bits of classical communication . in this process",
    ", the unknown quantum state does not travel through the quantum channel and thus this process does not have any classical analogue .",
    "this extremely interesting nonclassical nature of the quantum teleportation phenomenon drew considerable attention from the quantum communication community and consequently a large number of modified teleportation schemes have been proposed ( for a review see chapter 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for example",
    ", a large number of proposals have been made for quantum information splitting ( qis ) or quantum secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite , controlled teleportation ( ct ) @xcite , hierarchical quantum information splitting ( hqis ) @xcite , remote state preparation ( rsp ) @xcite .",
    "all these schemes may be viewed as modified teleportation protocols .",
    "considerable attention has been devoted to bidirectional controlled quantum state teleportation ( bcst ) @xcite , controlled remote state preparation @xcite and joint remote state preparation ( jrsp ) @xcite , among others .",
    "the original scheme of quantum teleportation was a one - way scheme in which alice teleports an unknown qubit to bob by using two bits of classical communication and an entangled state already shared by them .",
    "subsequently , it was modified by huelga _ et al_. @xcite and others to obtain schemes for bidirectional state teleportation ( bst ) , where both alice and bob can simultaneously transmit unknown qubits to each other .",
    "it was also established that bst is useful for the implementation of nonlocal quantum gates or quantum remote controls .",
    "recently , bst schemes have been generalized to obtain a set of schemes for bidirectional controlled state teleportation ( bcst ) @xcite .",
    "these bcst schemes are three party schemes where bst is possible provided the supervisor / controller ( charlie ) discloses his information ( measurement outcome ) . to be more precise , in a usual bst scheme",
    ", alice and bob can simultaneously transmit unknown quantum states to each other and reconstruct the state received by them without the help of a third party ( charlie ) , whereas in a bcst scheme also alice and bob can simultaneously transmit unknown quantum states to each other as in bst , but could not reconstruct the state received by them until the supervisor charlie ( third party ) allows them to do so .    in another line of research , conventional teleportation schemes",
    "were modified to address a specific scenario , where the sender ( alice ) knows the state to be teleported , whereas the receiver ( bob ) is completely unaware of it .",
    "such modified teleportation schemes are referred to as schemes for the rsp .",
    "thus , an rsp scheme may be viewed as a scheme for teleportation of a known quantum state .",
    "rsp is possible with different kinds of quantum channels and it s not limited to the remote preparation of known single qubit states .",
    "in fact , several schemes for remote preparation of known multipartite quantum states are also reported in the recent past .",
    "initially , the rsp scheme was designed for a single qubit state @xcite .",
    "the scheme was probabilistic , but it was shown that the task of remote preparation of a known single qubit can be performed using a bit of classical communication and a shared entanglement . subsequently , this idea was generalized to a deterministic rsp @xcite , wherein the remote state could be prepared with unit success probability .",
    "however , the reduction in classical communication with respect to a quantum teleportation scheme that was achieved in the original scheme was lost here .",
    "the idea of rsp has been generalized , recently , in many other ways .",
    "for example , rsp schemes are proposed for remote preparation of a 4-qubit @xmath2 state @xcite , multi - qubit @xmath2 state @xcite , 4-qubit cluster - type state @xcite , arbitrary two qubit state @xcite and w state @xcite .",
    "further , schemes for jrsp have been constructed .",
    "a jrsp scheme involves at least three parties .",
    "the simplest jrsp designed by an @xcite can be described as follows .",
    "sender1 , sender2 and receiver share a @xmath2 state .",
    "sender1 and sender2 want to jointly transmit a qubit @xmath3 to the receiver , but sender1 knows @xmath4 and sender2 knows @xmath5 .",
    "in such a case sender1 measures his / her qubit using @xmath6 , @xmath7 basis set and announces the result .",
    "subsequently , sender2 measures his / her qubit using @xmath8 @xmath9 basis set ( depending upon sender1 s measurement outcome sender2 may have to apply a unitary operation before measuring his / her qubit in @xmath10 basis ) and announces the result . using measurement outcomes of the senders , the receiver can apply appropriate unitary operations and reconstruct the unknown quantum state , which is jointly transmitted by the senders . extending this idea jrsp schemes were proposed for , among others , w and w - type states @xcite , arbitrary two qubit state @xcite and 4-qubit cluster like state @xcite . further generalizing these ideas , schemes were proposed for controlled rsp @xcite , controlled jrsp @xcite , multi - party controlled jrsp @xcite , deterministic jrsp @xcite and jrsp with a passive receiver @xcite .",
    "thus , a large number of variants of the rsp scheme have been investigated in a one - directional scenario . however , except a recent work by cao and an @xcite , no serious effort has yet been made to realize these features of rsp in bidirectional scenarios .",
    "such a scenario is practically relevant and can be visualized easily in analogy with bcst as follows .",
    "consider that both alice and bob wish to remotely prepare quantum states that are known to the senders , but unknown to the receivers and receivers can reconstruct the state only when the supervisor charlie allows them to do so .",
    "a scheme for realizing this task would be referred to as the controlled bidirectional remote state preparation ( cbrsp ) .",
    "such a scheme of cbrsp has been proposed in @xcite by using a 5-qubit state @xmath11 where the subscripts @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 indicate the qubits of alice ( sender ) , bob ( receiver ) and charlie ( controller ) , respectively . for our convenience ,",
    "we can replace @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 by @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , and after particle swapping rewrite the above state as @xmath18 where @xmath19 clearly , this is one of the states shown to be useful for bcst in @xcite . to be precise , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the general form of the states that are useful for bcst may be described as @xmath20 where quantum states @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 and as before @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath14 represent sender , receiver and controller and @xmath22 as single qubit states , but it is not essential .",
    "one may consider them as 2-qubit in particular or n - qubit ( n>1 ) states in general , but that would only introduce additional complexity . ] . here",
    "@xmath27 is a bell state and the condition @xmath28 ensures that charlie s qubit is appropriately entangled with the remaining 4 qubits @xcite .",
    "to be precise , the receiver and the sender are unaware of the entangled ( bell ) states they share unless the controller measures his qubit in @xmath29 basis and discloses the result .",
    "we know that a shared bell state and two bits of classical communication is sufficient for teleportation , but without the disclosure of the controller , the receiver will not be able to choose appropriate unitary operations that will be required to reconstruct the state . in what follows , we will extend our earlier work on bcst @xcite and cao and an s recent work on cbrsp @xcite to show that if the state ( [ eq : the 5-qubit state ] ) satisfies the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) then on the disclosure of the outcome of charlie s measurement in @xmath29 basis , alice and bob will know with certainty which two bell states they share and consequently they will be able to implement a scheme for probabilistic rsp or deterministic rsp in a controlled bidirectional manner .    in the discussion",
    "so far we have seen that probabilistic and deterministic rsp , jrsp , controlled rsp and controlled jrsp are studied in detail for one directional cases .",
    "we have also noted that rsp and teleportation are closely linked phenomena as rsp can be viewed as teleportation of a known qubit .",
    "interestingly , a set of schemes for bcst have been proposed , but only a single deterministic scheme for cbrsp using 5-qubit cluster states is proposed till date . neither any scheme for probabilistic cbrsp , nor a scheme for controlled joint brsp ( cjbrsp ) is proposed until now . keeping , these facts in mind , the present paper aims to provide schemes for ( i ) probabilistic cbrsp , ( ii ) deterministic cbrsp and ( iii ) deterministic cjbrsp using quantum states of the generic form ( [ eq : the 5-qubit state ] ) .",
    "further , we aim to show that the schemes for probabilistic cbrsp , deterministic cbrsp and deterministic cjbrsp can be realized using infinitely many different quantum channels as the state described by ( [ eq : the 5-qubit state ] ) can be constructed in 144 different ways for each choice of @xmath29 basis and @xmath29 can be chosen in infinitely many ways @xcite .",
    "thus , the recently proposed cao and an scheme of deterministic cbrsp is just a special case of infinitely many possibilities and their proposal , which is limited to deterministic cbrsp can be extended to probabilistic cbrsp and deterministic cjbrsp , too .",
    "a practical implementation of any rsp protocol would imply taking into account the effect of the ambient environment on the basic processes that constitute the protocol .",
    "for example , all control protocols , as discussed here , depend upon the information sent to the sender , receiver by the controller .",
    "this information is encoded in the travel qubits , i.e. , the qubits prepared by the controller and sent to different receivers and senders .",
    "these travel qubits traverse through physical space and would be susceptible to the influence of the ambient environment , resulting in noise . here",
    "we model such a situation by studying the effect of two well known noise models , viz . , the amplitude - damping and phase - damping channels @xcite on a probabilistic cbrsp protocol , and indicate how these effects can be taken into account for a deterministic cbrsp as well as for deterministic cjbrsp .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : probabilistic - controlled - bidirectional ] , we propose a protocol of probabilistic cbrsp using quantum states of the form ( [ eq : the 5-qubit state ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : deterministic - controlled - bidirectional ] , we show that the same states can be used to realize deterministic cbrsp .",
    "we propose a protocol of deterministic cjbrsp , in section [ sec : deterministic - controlled - joint ] . in section",
    "[ sec : effect - of - damping ] , we discuss the effect of the amplitude - damping and the phase - damping noise channels on the probabilistic cbrsp scheme described in this paper . finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us assume that the sender ( s ) and receiver ( r ) share an entangled state @xmath30 .",
    "now the sender wishes to transmit a known qubit @xmath3 to the receiver . here , the sender knows the values of @xmath31 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , the receiver is completely unaware of these values .",
    "now we introduce a new basis set @xmath32 , where latexmath:[\\[\\begin{array}{lcl }     using @xmath32 basis set we can write @xmath34 ) we can express the entangled state @xmath30 shared by the receiver and sender as follows : @xmath35 now the sender measures his / her qubit in @xmath32 basis set and communicates the result to the receiver . from ( [ eq : rsp3 ] ) it is clear that if the sender s measurement outcome is @xmath36 then the receiver does not need to do anything to reconstruct the qubit unknown to him , but if the outcome of the sender s measurement is @xmath37 then the protocol fails as without the knowledge of @xmath38 the receiver will not be able to transform @xmath36 into @xmath39 .",
    "thus , if the sender and receiver share a prior entanglement , then the teleportation of a known qubit requires only one projective measurement and one bit of classical communication .",
    "therefore , probabilistic remote state preparation requires fewer resources than conventional teleportation .",
    "now we may note that rsp is also possible when other bell states are used as initially shared entanglement . to be precise , in @xmath32 basis",
    ", we can write @xmath40 basis and announces the outcome , then the receiver can reconstruct the state ( in those cases where the output of the sender s measurement is @xmath36 ) by applying a unitary operator on his / her ( receiver s ) qubit , provided the receiver knows which bell state he / she shared with the sender . the specific relation between the initially shared entangled state and receiver s operation",
    "can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsp3])-([eq : rsp4 ] ) and the same is summarized in table [ tab : probabilistic rsp ] .",
    "now , if we consider that charlie prepares the @xmath41-qubit state ( [ eq : the 5-qubit state ] ) and sends qubits @xmath42 to alice and @xmath43 to bob .",
    "in this situation alice and bob share two bell states that can be used for bidirectional remote state preparation ( say the first bell state is shared for alice to bob transmission and the second one for bob to alice transmission ) . both of the senders can make the necessary measurements in the rotated bases . to be precise ,",
    "if alice wishes to remotely prepare @xmath3 at bob s end , then she should measure @xmath44 qubit in @xmath45 basis as given in ( [ eq : rsp1 ] ) .",
    "similarly , if bob wishes to remotely prepare @xmath46 at alice s end , he should measure his qubit @xmath47 in @xmath48 basis where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , the receivers will not be able to apply the required unitary operator unless they know which bell states were initially shared by them .",
    "for this information , they have to wait for charlie s announcement of a measurement outcome which he obtains by measuring his qubit in @xmath51 basis .",
    "specifically , from ( [ eq : the 5-qubit state ] ) we can see that if charlie s measurement outcome is @xmath21 then alice to bob ( bob to alice ) rsp channel is @xmath52 ( @xmath53 . similarly , if charlie s measurement outcome is @xmath22 then alice to bob ( bob to alice ) rsp channel is @xmath54 ( @xmath55 . thus , charlie can control the bidirectional remote state preparation protocol described here . further , since the protocol succeeds only when the sender s measurement outcome is @xmath36 ( @xmath56 ) , thus the protocol is of probabilistic nature . in brief , we have obtained a generalized pati - type scheme for probabilistic cbrsp .      &",

    "the cbrsp scheme described in the previous section and its parent scheme ( one - directional pati scheme ) was probabilistic . in @xcite the pati scheme was generalized to obtain a one - directional deterministic scheme . in their original scheme @xcite , the sender ( s ) and receiver ( r ) start with a shared bell state @xmath65 , where the sender ( s ) has the first qubit and the receiver ( r ) has the second qubit .",
    "the sender also prepares another ancillary qubit in state @xmath66 which is indexed with the subscript @xmath67 subsequently , the sender applies a cont operation using the @xmath68 qubit as the control qubit and the @xmath69 qubit as the target qubit to obtain a combined state @xmath70 which is nothing but a @xmath2 state . for our convenience ,",
    "we have indexed the @xmath2 states produced in this way with a superscript @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the decimal value of the first component of the superposition that forms the @xmath2 state ( i.e. , decimal value of 000 ) and the @xmath73 sign denotes the relative phase between the two components of the superposition .",
    "before , we describe the original protocol of @xcite in detail , we would like to note a few things for our convenience .",
    "firstly , a bell state can be expressed in general as @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the decimal value of binary number @xmath78 and @xmath79 denotes the relative phase between the two components of the superposition .",
    "this would lead to 4 @xmath2 states depending upon the choice of initial bell state .",
    "similarly , we can obtain 4 more @xmath2 states if the sender prepares the ancillary qubit in the state @xmath80 .",

    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) we can easily see that if sender s measurement of the first qubit in @xmath86 basis yields @xmath87 then the state of the remaining qubits collapses to @xmath88 and if the measurement yields @xmath89 then the state of the remaining qubits collapses to @xmath90 . in @xcite ,",
    "the sender follows two different routes depending on the outcome of the previous measurement . to be precise ,",
    "when he / she obtains @xmath87 he / she applies a phase gate @xmath91 on the qubit @xmath69 to transform @xmath92 to @xmath93 however , if his / her measurement yields @xmath89 , then he / she does nothing ( i.e. , keeps the state @xmath90 unchanged ) .",

    "thus we have a protocol for deterministic rsp using an initially shared bell state which was prepared in @xmath65 .",
    "it is easy to check that if the receiver and sender start from other bell states , then , also the above protocol succeeds in deterministic rsp .",
    "however , the unitary operations to be performed by the receiver are different for different initial shared states as shown in table [ tab : deterministic - rsp ] .",
    "now , it is easy to observe that if alice and bob start with a quantum state of the form ( [ eq : the 5-qubit state ] ) and in a manner analogous to the probabilistic cbrsp described in the previous section use one bell state for alice to bob transmission and the other one for bob to alice transmission , then both of them will be able to remotely prepare their quantum states provided they know which bell states they share .",
    "thus , only after charlie measures his qubit in @xmath51 basis and announces the result , alice and bob will know which operations from the table [ tab : deterministic - rsp ] are to be used .",

    "@xcite is quite general and can be easily applied to other schemes of quantum communication in general and to the schemes of bidirectional quantum communication in particular .",
    "for example , if we wish to extend the present discussion to the case of the deterministic cbrsp scheme described in section [ sec : deterministic - controlled - bidirectional ] then we have to use a 7-qubit state , but the kraus operators would still operate on the same qubits as in the case of the probabilistic cbrsp as the additional qubits used for deterministic cbrsp are prepared locally by the senders and these qubits are not exposed to the noisy environment .",

    "[ fig : comparisno ] ) for the same value of decoherence rate @xmath197 thus we see that information loss is less when the travel qubits are transferred through the amplitude - damping channel as compared to the phase - damping channel , in consistence with the work in @xcite where similar considerations were applied to a jrsp process .",
    "we have provided protocols of probabilistic cbrsp , deterministic cbrsp and deterministic cjbrsp .",

    "this advantage of lesser classical communication is lost in the deterministic cbrsp .",

    "however , the operations used in deterministic cbrsp are such that it can be modified quickly into the protocol of deterministic cjbrsp .",
    "interestingly , it is shown that the above protocols can be realized using infinitely many alternative quantum channels .",
    "further , the deterministic protocols described above can also be turned in to probabilistic protocols of bidirectional rsp by considering the @xmath2 states shared by the sender(s ) and receiver to be non - maximally entangled . in such a situation we will obtain a controlled bidirectional version of the recently proposed rsp scheme of wei et al . @xcite .",

    "the effect of amplitude - damping and phase - damping noise , on our protocols , makes the present study much more realistic compared to the existing works as in practice we can not have a noise - free quantum channel .",
