    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emit huge amounts of energy as a result of accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes ( hereafter smbhs ) .",
    "strong hard x - ray emission from these nuclei can be represented by power - law emission with a canonical photon index of @xmath41.9 .",
    "the strong emission irradiates material around the smbh , leading to reprocessing of the emission .",
    "observation of the reprocessed emission is conducive to revealing the environment of the black hole , and hence help to understand the problems of the fuel supply and evolution of smbhs .",
    "compton - thick agns are suitable for the study of the reprocessed emission in agns , since their reprocessed emission dominates over the direct emission below 10 kev due to large column density @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , compton - thick agns are thought to be abundant in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , these objects are important for understanding some key problems in agn research , for example synthesis modeling of the cosmic x - ray background ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the growth of agns .",
    "however , their spectra are so complex that the detailed nature of compton - thick agns has thus far been unclear .",
    "there is another problem for spectral analyses of compton - thick agns .",
    "the baseline model based on previous observations , which consists of both a direct and a reflection component , has been used to reproduce the complex x - ray spectra of compton - thick agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model worked well for reproducing their spectra , and has contributed to our understanding of agn .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain information about the structure of the surrounding material from spectral fitting with this baseline model because the reflection model was developed for an accretion disc geometry .",
    "thus , the reflection model does not match exactly with the actual reflection from the material around the black hole .",
    "therefore we need a model that represents actual x - ray emission from the surrounding material using detailed monte carlo simulations .",
    "previous work that has investigated agn x - ray spectra by means of monte carlo simulations so far includes the following .",
    "@xcite assumed a semi - infinite , plane - parallel configuration , and they calculated reflection from a plane - parallel slab . @xcite computed transmission through a homogeneous sphere of cold material with a radius determined by its column density . @xcite and @xcite computed x - ray spectra emitted from agns and assumed a torus structure which has an open reflecting area characterized by its half - opening angle .",
    "however , these results were not applied to make available convenient spectral - fitting models to reproduce the x - ray spectrum of , for example , a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "we assume surrounding material with a 3d torus configuration and then simulate a spectrum from an agn , considering the effect of compton down - scattering and absorption . performing monte carlo simulations",
    ", we investigate the relation between continuum emissions and the structure of the torus .",
    "furthermore , the strength of iron line is important to reveal the existence of a hidden nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we also investigate a dependency of the iron line on the structure of the torus .",
    "we apply our simulation results to the spectral fitting of the x - ray spectrum of mrk 3 observed with @xmath0 , thereby constraining the structure of the torus in this seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "in our monte carlo simulation , we adopted a standard spherical coordinate system with the radial distance ( @xmath7 ) from the origin , the zenith angle ( @xmath8 ) from the z - axis , and the azimuthal angle ( @xmath9 ) from the x - axis .",
    "a primary radiation source was placed at the origin , and illuminates the surrounding material .",
    "the material was assumed to be neutral and cold ( t @xmath10 @xmath11 k ) .",
    "we took into account photoelectric absorption , iron fluorescence , and compton scattering in our simulation .",
    "the photoelectric absorption cross - section , @xmath12 , was calculated by using the nist xcom database and the cosmic elemental abundances of @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the photoelectric absorption cross - section of fe for deciding iron absorption events .",
    "note that the cross - section by @xcite is not valid for energies above 10 kev , and that the nist cross - section in the 1100 kev band is nearly equal to that by @xcite which is identified as @xmath13 in @xmath14 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the compton scattering cross - section , @xmath15 , was calculated with the klein - nishina formula .",
    "the number density of electrons , @xmath16 , for compton scattering was related to the effective hydrogen number density , @xmath17 , by @xmath16 = 1.2 @xmath17 .",
    "we used the iron k - shell fluorescence yield of 0.34 @xcite and a ratio 17:150 between the iron @xmath18 and @xmath19 fluorescence line transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "although the iron @xmath19 fluorescence line consists of two components , @xmath20 and @xmath21 at 6.404 and 6.391 kev , respectively ( for neutral iron ) with a branching ratio of 2:1 @xcite , we made no distinction between @xmath20 and @xmath21 photons , adopting a common value of 6.40 kev .",
    "the iron @xmath18 line is 7.06 kev for neutral iron .",
    "a cross section view of the adopted structure of the torus is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the center of the torus is placed at the origin of the coordinate system , and the equatorial plane of the torus structure lies in the x - y plane .",
    "the structure of the torus is described by the following structure parameters : the half - opening angle @xmath22 , the column density @xmath23 along the equatorial plane , and inner ( @xmath24 ) and outer ( @xmath25 ) radii of the torus .",
    "we assumed @xmath24/@xmath25 = 0.01 in our simulation .",
    "the angle @xmath26 in figure 2 presents the inclination angle of the torus relative to the observer .",
    "a ray - trace method was adopted in our monte carlo simulation .",
    "the primary x - ray source was assumed to emit photons with the energy spectrum , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a cut - off energy fixed at 360 kev .",
    "the spectrum is typical for type 1 agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the primary x - ray source was assumed to be isotropic .",
    "each photon from the primary source had both an initial energy and an initial direction of propagation . in the case",
    "that a photon was injected into the torus , an interaction point of the photon was calculated by using a random number ( see below ) .",
    "if the compton scattering occurred at that point , the energy and the direction of photon was changed .",
    "the photon was tracked until it escaped the torus structure , or until it was absorbed in the torus .",
    "note that when the photon with an energy above iron k - edge was absorbed by iron , a k - shell fluorescence line was isotropically emitted with a probability of the k - shell fluorescence yield in our simulation , where the iron absorption event was decided by using the ratio between the photoelectric absorption of iron and @xmath29 .",
    "both energies and directions of propagation of all escaping photons were recorded in a photon list . for a given observed torus inclination angle of @xmath26 ( see figure 2 ) , we extracted photons whose zenith angles of propagation ranged within @xmath26@xmath30 1@xmath31 , from the photon list , and then the extracted photons were accumulated into energy bins to form a spectrum .",
    "the photon transportation in the torus is a key technique in our monte carlo simulation .",
    "the distance @xmath32 to the next interaction is determined by the probability @xmath33 , which is described as follows :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are an optical depth and the total cross section of the interaction , respectively .",
    "the @xmath37 is comprised of the sum of @xmath12 and @xmath15 . by inverting the cumulative probability function , @xmath32 is expressed as @xmath38    the distance @xmath32 is calculated from a uniform random number between 0 and 1 referred to as @xmath33 .",
    "another key in our simulation is compton scattering .",
    "the scattering angle , @xmath39 ( relative to its direction of propagation ) , is calculated by the differential cross - section for compton scattering .",
    "we assumed that the differential cross - section was proportional to ( 1+@xmath40 ) , as for the thomson differential cross - section , since this approximation is efficient for analysis of the @xmath0 data below a few hundreds kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that this assumption over - estimates back - scattering relative to forward scattering at high energies .",
    "the effect of this approximation is seen in the reflection components , and depends on the geometry and @xmath41 of the torus . in order to estimate the effect , we performed a simulation in the case of @xmath42=40@xmath31 , @xmath43=41@xmath31 , and @xmath41=10@xmath44 @xmath3 , and found that the change of the reflection components due to this assumption was @xmath110% at 100  kev .",
    "the azimuthal angle of the scattering , @xmath45 , was randomly selected in the region 0@xmath31",

    "figure 3 is an example of a simulated agn spectrum with @xmath23 = @xmath51 , @xmath22 = 40@xmath31 , and @xmath26 = 45@xmath31 .",
    "we generated a total number of 2.5@xmath5210@xmath53 photons .",
    "the same number of photons were generated for each run throughout this paper .",
    "we separated the simulated spectrum into direct and reflection components , where the direct component has no interaction with the surrounding material , while the reflection component consists of x - ray photons reflected in the surrounding material . since an reflection component , which was modeled by @xmath54 in xspec ,",
    "was required in the @xmath0 spectrum of mrk 3 by @xcite , we divided the simulated reflection component into two , which are referred to as the reflection components 1 and 2 .",
    "the reflection component 2 consists of photons emitted from the inner wall of the torus without obscuration by the torus .",
    "the reflection component 1 consists of the rest of the reflected photons ( see figure 2 ) .",

    "all the three components , especially the direct component , show a dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "it is expected that the direct component is affected only by the column density ( @xmath57 ) along our line of sight .",
    "we compared the simulated direct components with the cut - off power - law models , which were affected by both photoelectric absorption and compton scattering ( figure 5 ) .",

    "the left panel in figure 6 shows simulated spectra of the reflection component 1 for @xmath22 = @xmath62 in steps of 10@xmath31 .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath26 were fixed at @xmath51 and @xmath63 in these runs , respectively .",
    "the spectral shape of the reflection component 1 has a small dependence on @xmath22 , and the total photon count in the reflection component 1 decreases with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "we plot the total count in figure 7 .",
    "since some photons emitted from the central source escape through the opening area of the torus , the intensity of the reflection component 1 is dependent upon @xmath22 .",
    "we compared the total counts of this component with the covering fraction of the torus , @xmath64 . in the right panel in figure 8 , we plot the normalized total counts , which are divided by the total counts in the case of spherical distribution of the surrounding material . it is found that the @xmath22-dependence of the reflection component 1 can be roughly explained by the covering fraction of the surrounding material . for large @xmath41 of 10@xmath44 @xmath3 , the total counts do not follow this @xmath42-dependence as for low @xmath41 due to the absorption of the reflection component by the torus itself .",
    "the right panel in figure 6 shows the @xmath22-dependence of the reflection component 2 . in these runs , we set @xmath26=@xmath22 + 1@xmath31 in order to obtain a high intensity of the reflection component 2 under the condition that the nucleus is obscured by the torus .",
    "the total count of the reflection component 2 are shown in figure 7 .",
    "it is found that the reflection component 2 is to be zero at both @xmath22 = 0 and 90@xmath31 , and has a maximum intensity at @xmath65 .",
    "the reflection component 2 is emitted from the visible inner wall of the torus .",
    "thus , this component vanishes at @xmath22 = 0 due to there being no inner wall .",
    "this component is also associated with the total number of photons injected into the torus from the central source , which is related to the solid angle of the torus .",
    "therefore , the intensity of the reflection component 2 is associated with a combination of both apparent size of the visible inner wall of the torus and solid angle of the torus , i.e. @xmath66 . the left panel in figure 8 shows the total counts of the reflection component 2 in @xmath41=10@xmath67 , 10@xmath2 , and 10@xmath44 @xmath3 . for the case of @xmath41=10@xmath44 @xmath3 ,",
    "the @xmath42-dependence is well reproduced by the combination described as @xmath66 , since the reflection occurs mainly on the inner surface of the torus .",
    "we show simulated spectra of the reflection components for @xmath22=10@xmath31 with @xmath26=@xmath68 to @xmath69 in steps of 20@xmath31 in figure 9 , and show the total counts at @xmath22=10@xmath31 and 30@xmath31 against @xmath26 from 1@xmath31 to 89@xmath31 in steps of 2@xmath31 in figure 10 . in these runs , @xmath23 was fixed at @xmath51 .",
    "the reflection component 1 has a weak @xmath26-dependence ( see figure 9 ) , and has a similar intensity in @xmath26 @xmath70 @xmath22 + 10@xmath31 ( figure 10 ) .",
    "the @xmath26-dependence is consistent with the fact that the reflection component 1 depends on the covering factor of the surrounding material as mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "the unified model of seyfert galaxies predicts that @xmath26 is larger than @xmath22 in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "thus , for most seyfert 2 galaxies , the reflection component 1 should show a small @xmath26-dependence , and this component should depend on mainly @xmath42 and @xmath41 of the torus . in the case of @xmath42 @xmath46 @xmath43 @xmath46",
    "@xmath42 + 10@xmath31 , the reflection component 1 should have a strong @xmath43-dependence .",
    "the reflection component 2 shows a strong @xmath26-dependence ( figure 9 ) , because the component is emitted from the visible inner wall , whose area is decreasing with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "if we observe the source edge - on , i.e. ; @xmath43 = 90@xmath31 , the area of the wall is apparently zero for the observer . on the other hand , if we observe the source face - on , i.e. ; @xmath43=0@xmath31 , the projected area ( i.e. the area projected onto the sky , perpendicular to the line of sight ) is largest .",
    "the @xmath43-dependence of the reflection component 2 is roughly explained only by that of the projected area .",
    "note that larger portion of the projected area , or the visible inner region , is obscured by the near side of the torus with increasing @xmath43 in @xmath43 @xmath70 @xmath42 .",
    "the spectral shape of the reflection component 2 is also affected by @xmath26 as shown in figure 9 . with increasing @xmath43 ,",
    "the low - energy cut off becomes more pronounced .",
    "this is because only x - rays reflected from the visible inner region of the torus ( see figure 2 ) contribute to the reflection component 2 , as defined .",
    "some photons emitted from the central source enter the far side of the torus and compton scattered .",
    "a part of the scattered photons are absorbed inside the torus before they ever reach the visible inner region .",
    "since the length of the path of such photons increases with @xmath43 , more photons are absorbed before they reach the visible region . as a result , we can see a @xmath26-dependence on the spectral shape .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 ( = @xmath7 ) was fixed at 0.01 in our simulation .",
    "we briefly discuss the spectral dependence on this ratio .",
    "we simulated the reflection components with different values of the ratio , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , and 1 . in these runs , @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 were set to be @xmath51 , 40@xmath31 , and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the reflection component 1 shows a very weak dependence on this ratio , since these simulations were carried out for the same @xmath22 , and this component depends mainly on the covering fraction of the torus . on the other hand , the reflection component 2 below @xmath1 4",
    "kev depends on the ratio @xmath7 ( figure 11 ) .",
    "reflections occur more frequently than absorption at the inner region of the torus",
    ". thus , in the case of the small @xmath7 , the closest region to the source is obscured by the torus , since we consider the case of seyfert 2 galaxies , @xmath26 @xmath70 @xmath22 .",
    "this effect is also seen in the @xmath26 dependence of the reflection component 2 ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "this study indicates that it is difficult to produce a strong unabsorbed reflection - component in our simple torus geometry with a small @xmath7 ( = 0.001 ) .      in our simulation , x",
    "- rays emitted from the central source were absorbed by the dusty torus .",
    "it is important to compare the absorbed x - ray luminosity with the infrared luminosity , since the infrared luminosity is a good indicator for the absorbing luminosity in the torus .",
    "we estimated the fraction of the absorbed luminosity with respect to the intrinsic source luminosity .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the central x - ray source was calculated from the assumed spectrum in section 2.2 , and the absorbed x - ray luminosity was derived from the subtraction of an output luminosity from the intrinsic luminosity , where the output luminosity was deduced from a total energy of the escaping photons from the torus structure .",

    "( 1994 ) , the infrared luminosity for an agn with the 210 kev x - ray luminosity of 1@xmath5210@xmath74 erg s@xmath75 is estimated to be 10@xmath76 erg s@xmath75 , which is about 10 times larger than the absorbed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the dust in the torus is heated by optical and uv photons as well as x - ray photons .",

    "the scatter seen in the relation may be explained by the @xmath42-dependence of the absorbed luminosity .      a prominent iron line with an equivalent width of @xmath70 a few 100 ev is an important characteristic of seyfert 2 galaxies .",

    "we noted that the @xmath77 in the compton - thick regime is greater than 1000 ev in our simulations .",

    "the minimum @xmath103 ( @xmath105 ) was obtained for @xmath43 @xmath46 @xmath42 , and the @xmath103 was more than @xmath105 + 30 for @xmath43 @xmath70 @xmath42 + 3@xmath31 . since the @xmath43 must be larger than the @xmath42 in our simple torus model ( otherwise the @xmath95 becomes zero ) , the @xmath103 study indicates that we observed the mrk 3 nucleus near the edge of the torus .",
    "this is expected from the strong unabsorbed reflection component of mrk 3 in the baseline model .",
    "on the other hand , we found that it is difficult to constrain the half - opening angle @xmath42 from the spectral analysis , since the shapes of the reflection components 1 and 2 show a little @xmath42-dependence ( figure 6 ) .",
    "although their intensities depend on @xmath42 as shown in figure 7 , the intensities of the reflection components also depend on the luminosity of the central source .",
    "figure 15 shows the change of the normalization of the direct and reflection components for @xmath43=@xmath42 + 1@xmath31 .",
    "the normalization of the reflection component is roughly proportional 1/@xmath64 .",
    "this relation indicates that the contribution of the reflection components to the observed spectrum is nearly constant .",
    "furthermore , the spectral shape of the reflection component 1 in the 570 kev band is similar to that of the direct component at @xmath10610@xmath2 @xmath3 ( see figure 3 ) . as a result , it is hard to constrain @xmath42 , even if we link the intensities between the direct and reflection components .",
    "we note that the iron ew is not helpful to find the @xmath42 of mrk 3 , since @xmath77 has a little dependence on @xmath42 in @xmath41 @xmath46 10@xmath2 @xmath3 .    in order to constrain @xmath94 , we fitted the observed spectrum with our model on the grid of @xmath94 . since we did not constrain the @xmath42 from the spectral fit , we fixed @xmath42 at 50@xmath31 , and @xmath107 at @xmath42 + 1@xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath95 was a free parameter in this fit .",
    "we found that there is a @xmath103 minimum around @xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 , and that the @xmath103 is greater than @xmath105 + 30 for @xmath94 @xmath46 6@xmath5210@xmath67 and for @xmath94 @xmath70 2@xmath5210@xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "we found that we constrain the structure parameter @xmath41 of the torus by using our new model .",
    "the opening angle may be estimated from the opening angle of the nlr .",
    "@xcite found a nlr opening angle in mrk 3 of @xmath70 @xmath108 .",
    "the half opening angle of @xmath70@xmath109 is larger than the estimation by @xcite due to the inclusion of all the z - shape emission components in the nlr in the estimation of @xcite .",
    "we here set @xmath79 = @xmath109 and @xmath43 = @xmath110 in our spectral fit .",
    "furthermore , the column density @xmath95 was linked with @xmath94 by @xmath95=0.74 @xmath94 , by using the equation ( 3 ) .",
    "we obtained a small reduced @xmath103 value of 1.18 ( d.o.f.=613 ) , which is comparable to that with the baseline model .",
    "table 3 shows the best - fit parameters , and figure 16 shows the best - fit spectrum .",
    "the photon index of the power law component and the column density of @xmath95 were estimated to be @xmath11.82 and @xmath11.1@xmath5210@xmath2 @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the power law component in the 210 kev band was estimated to be 2.1@xmath5210@xmath74 erg s@xmath75 , which is about 1.3 times that of the estimate with the baseline model and is consistent with that obtained by using the model with @xmath111 @xcite , which describes the x - ray transmission , correctly taking into account compton scattering @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the intrinsic luminosity irradiating the accretion torus is estimated to be 5.1@xmath5210@xmath74 erg s@xmath75 from the normalization of the reflection component .",
    "the discrepancy of the intrinsic luminosities between the direct and reflection components may be arisen by a time lag of the reflection component , since the long time variability of mrk 3 has been reported and the distance of the accretion torus is estimated to be greater than 1 pc from the center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we simulated agn spectra by using the ray - trace method , and made a new model for fitting spectra of compton - thick agns . in our simulations we assumed an accretion torus surrounding a nucleus , which was characterized by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath41 , and the ratio of the inner and outer radii of the torus .",
    "we considered interactions of photoelectric absorption , iron fluorescence , and compton scattering in the simulation .",
    "the simulated spectra were separated into three components : one direct component and two reflection components .",
    "the direct component consists of x - ray photons which have no interaction with the surrounding material , and the component is only affected by column density along our line of sight .",
    "in fact , the direct component was well modeled with a cut - off power law emission affected by both photoelectric absorption and compton scattering . on the other hand",
    ", the reflection components had not only an @xmath41-dependence but also both @xmath42- and @xmath43-dependences .",
    "the reflection component 1 shows a @xmath42-dependence , which is explained by the covering factor of the torus .",
    "the reflection component 2 has dependence on both @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the dependence of the reflection component 2 is roughly explained by the apparent size of the visible inner wall of the torus .",
    "we fitted the @xmath0 mrk 3 spectrum with the new model based on our simulations , and found that the spectrum could be represented by our model .",
