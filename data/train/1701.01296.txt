    "recent observations confirm the existence of gravitational waves ( gw ) emitted in strongly gravitating binaries , where the nonlinearity of the einstein equations plays an important role .",
    "the observational data are convincingly reproducible with numerical models , however the performance of analytic descriptions of the strong gravity regime is still limited .    on the other hand , the model of colliding plane gw represents the simplest method to study nonlinear wave interactions analytically",
    ". therefore many features of nonlinearity as well as conceptual issues like focussing properties and arising singularities have been discussed on the basis of colliding plane waves so far .",
    "a lot of exact solutions have been described along with solution generating techniques constructing solutions in the interaction region and deriving the shape of the incoming waves afterwards ( cf . the overview of griffiths @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "hauser and ernst @xcite pioneered the search for a method to address the characteristic initial value problem and proved the existence and uniqueness of its solution .",
    "alekseev and griffiths @xcite described a more practical procedure for both colliding gravitational and electromagnetic waves leading to singular integral equations .",
    "our treatment of the characteristic initial value problem features many similarities to this approach , but allows for additional transformations to non - singular integral equations .",
    "it is expected to be better suited for approximations using spectral methods , but it is still too early to clearly compare the performance of the two approaches related to this goal",
    ". finally we aim for a systematic study of interaction properties of colliding plane gw depending on the initial data .",
    "in this paper we consider purely gravitational plane waves with distinct wavefronts and arbitrary polarisation colliding in a minkowski background .",
    "the corresponding spacetime features an orthogonally transitive two - dimensional group of isometries essentially reducing the einstein equations to the hyperbolic ernst equation .",
    "we make use of the strong formal analogy to axially symmetric and stationary spacetimes governed by the elliptic ernst equation by formulating a ` linear problem ' ( lp ) in the neugebauer form , cf .",
    "its solution can be represented by the solution of a riemann - hilbert problem ( rhp ) whose jump matrix is defined by the characteristic initial values .",
    "this procedure is known as the ` inverse scattering method ' , cf .",
    "@xcite for a general introduction and @xcite for the axisymmetric analog of our particular case . due to the inevitable non - analytic behaviour of the initial data on the wavefronts",
    ", the jump matrix is discontinuous . adapting a general method of vekua @xcite",
    ", we implement a transformation to a continuous rhp ( crhp ) which can be solved using non - singular integral equations .    because of the non - analytic behaviour of the initial data the rhp does not uniquely define the solution to the lp and we need to impose regularity conditions of the lp coefficient matrices .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom are supposed to lead to families of solutions and therefore our procedure could also serve as solution generating technique .",
    "we write the metric in the rosen - form with the parametrisation as given in @xcite : @xmath0 it contains the two real functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the complex ernst potential @xmath3 only depending on the two lightlike coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the spacelike coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 parametrise the planes of symmetry .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations reduce to the essential relations @xmath8 where by coordinate indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as @xmath9 and @xmath10 below we denote partial derivatives .",
    "equation has the general solution @xmath11 containing two arbitrary functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in accordance to griffiths",
    "@xcite we choose @xmath14 whereby and show that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are monotonically decreasing for @xmath15 . using them as coordinates ,",
    "becomes the hyperbolic ernst equation @xmath16 having determined @xmath17 and @xmath18 we can afterwards obtain the function @xmath19 by integration of the field equations and .",
    "together with @xmath17 also the function @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is a solution to the ernst equation .",
    "we fix this freedom by demanding as connection to the minkowski background the normalisation @xmath22      as illustrated in , it is appropriate to divide a colliding wave spacetime into four regions @xcite with the following coordinate dependencies of the metric functions : @xmath23        the physical interpretation is that on a minkowski background ( i ) two plane waves propagate undisturbed in opposite direction ( ii and iii , there is always a frame where the collision happens ` head on ' ) until their collision and nonlinear interaction(iv ) .    using the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 as coordinates in the interaction region iv , the characteristic initial value problem of colliding plane gw corresponds to finding a solution @xmath17 to the ernst equation with given initial values @xmath24 and @xmath25 respecting the normalisation . due to the fact that these boundaries are the characteristic curves of the ernst equation , it is sufficient to provide initial values of @xmath17 without additionally giving its derivatives .",
    "as indicated by the @xmath26 in the denominator within ( and discussed in detail in @xcite ) , the colliding wave spacetime features a generic scalar curvature singularity at @xmath27 .",
    "this can be understood by the mutual focussing properties of waves in gr . for a large variety of exceptional cases",
    "this singularity is replaced by a killing - cauchy horizon , but this horizon is conjectured to be unstable @xcite . for collinearly polarised waves",
    "this instability has been rigorously proven @xcite . the regions ii and iii are confined by coordinate degeneracies on lightlike hypersurfaces .",
    "they can be identified with the points @xmath28 and @xmath29 and inherit their singular character .",
    "nevertheless , for the vacuum case considered here they are no scalar curvature singularities on their own and so the term ` fold singularity ' has been established .      using the junction conditions of obrien and synge for lightlike boundaries ( shown to be appropriate by robson @xcite ) the metric has to meet the following demands : @xmath30 this allows us to perform @xmath31-transformations @xmath32 and @xmath33 to arrange @xmath34 alternatively , we may use such @xmath31-transformations to achieve @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath12 and @xmath13 are determined by the field equations , and the junction conditions with the minkowski background .",
    "also in this case the exponents @xmath37 describe the first order behaviour of @xmath12 and @xmath13 because they can not be changed by @xmath31-transformations .",
    "the field equations , impose the restriction @xmath38 where @xmath39 implies an impulsive wavefront .",
    "furthermore , together with the continuity of @xmath19 , they lead to the so - called ` colliding wave conditions ' for @xmath17 first formulated by hauser and ernst @xcite , which within the normalisation have the form @xmath40=2k_1 , \\quad \\lim_{\\left(f , g\\right)\\rightarrow(\\frac12,\\frac12 ) } \\left[(\\mbox{$\\frac12$}-g)e_g\\bar{e}_g\\right]=2k_2 , \\label{cwc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 in the context of the characteristic ivp the colliding wave conditions are a matter of choosing suitable initial values for @xmath17 featuring divergent derivatives at @xmath42 .",
    "in the course of the inverse scattering method , the nonlinear ernst equation is expressed as the integrability condition of a system of linear partial differential equations , the so - called linear problem ( lp ) .",
    "this system is in turn solved by constructing an appropriate riemann - hilbert problem ( rhp ) which has the same solution .",
    "this solution s inner and outer limit at a contour in the complex plane of a spectral parameter are through the rhp related by a purely multiplicative matrix - valued jump . in correspondence with the boundaries of the ivp , the contour of the rhp has to be chosen as two specific parts of the real axis .",
    "it is possible to construct a single closed contour by continuation of these parts , whereby we have to set the jump matrix to @xmath43 on the added parts .",
    "regrettably , the singularity in the derivatives of the ernst potential demanded by the colliding wave conditions leads to a jump matrix which tends to to a finite value different from @xmath43 at the ends of the initial contour .",
    "therefore the rhp is discontinuous and its solutions feature singularities at the ends of the initial contour .",
    "in fact , there are even two different appearances of these singularities , so that an ambiguity in the rhp solution arises at each of the two initial contours . in this article",
    "we perform a transformation to a continuous riemann - hilbert problem ( crhp ) which clarifies these ambiguities and which is supposed to have better numerical properties than the initial ( discontinuous ) rhp .        for given initial data @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "the following four steps indicated in have to be carried out :    1 .   translating the initial data into the jump matrix by solving a system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) . for special cases an analytical treatment is possible .",
    "2 .   solving the riemann - hilbert problem by expansion of an additive jump function in chebyshev polynomials 1 .   via singular integral equations with bad numerical properties 2 .   via transformation to the crhp and its non - singular integral equations with better numerical properties 3 .   evaluating regularity conditions , which assure that the rhp solution fulfills the lp .",
    "these are purely algebraic equations to determine the linear combination coefficients of the rhp s 4 basic solutions .",
    "4 .   fixing the remaining degrees of freedom to adapt the solution to its initial data",
    "the whole process of the inverse scattering method shall be illustrated by examining the case of collinearly polarised gravitational waves .",
    "the contour of the collinearly polarised case will be directly transferred to the rhp for gw with arbitrary polarisation .      within the newman - penrose formalism the singular waves in the spacetime regions ii and",
    "iii are described by the complex weyl tensor components @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . for linearly polarized initial waves",
    "the phases of these components are constant in region ii and iii .",
    "if these constant phases are even identical , the metric can be diagonalised containing only a real ernst potential .",
    "this very special setup is called the collision of collinearly polarised gw .    the general solution for collinear polarisation has been derived by hauser and ernst @xcite in terms of generalized abel transformations . it has been reformulated in order to obtain an initial point for the generalisation to arbitrary polarisation @xcite .",
    "we will follow the same line here to establish our methods through the collinear case .",
    "the lp for collinear polarisation is to find the function @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real functions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 whereas @xmath50 is an independent spectral parameter , which enters the equations through the spectral parameter @xmath51 depending on @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath50 .",
    "the partial derivatives @xmath52 and @xmath53 are taken with constant @xmath50 rather than constant @xmath51 .",
    "the solution @xmath54 can be thought of either as a function on the complex @xmath51-plane or as a function of @xmath50 defined on a two - sheeted riemann surface with branch cut along the segment @xmath55 $ ] , a twofold covering of the complex @xmath50-plane .",

    "we now fix this freedom by demanding the normalisation @xmath63 here and in the rest of the paper we use the following convention for an arbitrary function @xmath64 depending on @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath51 : where @xmath64 is displayed with 2 arguments , these should be understood as the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but where @xmath64 is displayed with a single argument , this should be taken as the value of @xmath51 . evaluating the lp at @xmath65 and @xmath66 equation easily leads to @xmath67 the ernst potential with the normalisation is therefore given by @xmath68      the rhp connected to is to find a function @xmath69 which is analytic everywhere in the complex riemann @xmath50-surface except on the contour @xmath70 , where it has a jump described by the equation @xmath71 herein @xmath72 is the inner ( left to the contour ) and @xmath73 the outer ( right to the contour ) limit of @xmath74 .",
