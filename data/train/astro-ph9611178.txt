    "any big undertaking , such as x - ray astronomy surely is , must set long range goals . with",
    "clear long - term science goals in place we can see which developments are essential , and which are mere sidelines - amusing , but dead ends .",
    "daniel goldin , the nasa administrator , urged astronomers ( san antonio aas meeting , january 1996 ) to make decade length plans , even if the plan changes in a few years time .",
    "this is what we do here .",
    "the goals we shall describe are deliberately ambitious . we propose that x - ray astronomers should aim to reach sensitivities 100 times beyond axaf , while retaining high angular resolution and achieving high dispersion spectroscopy ( table [ goal ] ) .",
    "this does not mean that the very next mission we design should necessarily have all these capabilities . nor does it rule out smaller missions with different goals .",
    "it does mean that the next major mission we design should at least be a deliberate and significant step toward these capabilities .",
    "to some readers these goals may seem hopelessly idealistic . as a result of this workshop",
    ", it seems instead that they are only a few factors of 2 away from reality .    in section 2",
    "we outline several areas of wide astrophysical importance to which x - ray astronomy can make crucial measurements , given a 10  sq.meter,1  arcsec .",
    "telescope ; in section 3 the current state of x - ray astronomy is reviewed and general ` discovery space ' arguments are introduced ; ; in section 4 we use these arguments to derive the 10  sq.meter , 1  arcsec , @xmath010  arcmin field of view telescope goals ; in section 5 we discuss instrumentation goals including the need for sensitivity in the 0.1 - 0.5  kev band ; in section 6 we summarize our assessment of the workshop against these goals ; and in section 7 we open the discussion on how to make this telescope a reality .",
    ".the 10 sq .",
    "meter x - ray telescope [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     a major weakness of the workshop was the lack of consideration of high spectral resolution using grating spectroscopy . since this is the only route to the necessary goal of @xmath31000 spectroscopy , so we must pursue it .",
    "three main missions emerged from the workshop as the next step .",
    "however , they only partially address our goals .",
    "these missions overlap considerably in their aims and concept : ( 1 ) a european follow - on to xmm that takes replica mirror technology another step ( @xmath2 1 - 3m@xmath4 ; @xmath55  hpd ) ; ( 2 ) a japanese successor to astro - e ( @xmath21 m@xmath4 , @xmath230[?]hpd ) using improved foil optics , and launched with the new large h-2 ; and ( 3 ) the us ` high throughput x - ray spectroscopy ' mission ( htxs ) ( @xmath2 1m@xmath4 ; @xmath515  hpd ) .    in their collecting area",
    "these plans are only a factor of 5 - 10 too small . in angular resolution",
    "however they all are inadequate .",
    "since all three missions stressed calorimeters and 1050  kev response none reaches the spectral resolution and low energy coverage that will turn x - ray astronomy into x - ray astrophysics .",
    "how can x - ray astronomy reach the 10  sq.m/1  arcsec goal ? as a community we need to become less ` political ' and more science driven .",
    "presently we act tactically , reacting to each announcement of a mission opportunity by putting together good proposals .",
    "since a good proposal requires the use of existing , proven technologies , we do not get beyond incremental advances .",
    "instead we must get strategic .",
    "we must set long term science goals , as we have done here , and then _ begin !",
    "_ start work now on achieving our goals through technology studies .",
    "the primary thrust of these technology studies must be innovative x - ray optics : the pursuit of _ several _ new mirror technologies .",
    "these studies need substantial funding , of order $ 2m / year each ( i.e. 5 man - years / year , including overhead , plus equipment ) .",
    "a $ 10m / year program sounds huge compared with the less than $ 0.5m / year now spent by nasa on x - ray optics , outside of flight programs .",
    "it is small potatoes , though compared with the astrophysics budget at nasa .",
    "it is similar to the nasa investment in astro - e or a smex , yet the pay - off is hugely greater .    a second but still very important study must address the spacecraft and space infrastructure needed to support a 10  sq.m .",
    "high resolution telescope .",
    "areas of importance include : long , low weight structures ; active control of optical benches ; moment - of - inertia balancing for fast slewing ; servicing from station , shuttle and small launchers .",
    "topical technical workshops on each of these areas would be a good way to focus the issues and technical challenges and to identify the most promising areas of work .    the us",
    ", european and japanese intermediate missions presented at the workshop should not take all the energies of the community and so prevent a strong development program .",
    "the goal we originally outlined seemed bold .",
    "this workshop has shown that in fact it is quite plausible , and only a stretch from plans now being formulated .",
    "we wish to thank many of our colleagues for stimulating discussions , especially andrew szentgyorgyi , nancy brickhouse , john raymond , richard willingale , ronald polidan , robert rosner , webster cash , roger angel , andrew fabian , john gibbons , steven murray , harvey tananbaum , salvo sciortino and giorgio palumbo ."

    "<S> a detailed consideration of science goals leads us to propose that a mirror collecting area of 10  sq.meters with arcsecond resolution , good field of view ( @xmath010  arcmin ) , and with high spectral resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath1=1000 - 10,000 ) defines the proper goal . </S>",
    "<S> this is about 100 times axaf , or 30 times xmm . </S>",
    "<S> this workshop has shown that this goal is only a reasonable stretch from existing concepts , and may be insufficiently bold .    </S>",
    "<S> an investment of @xmath2 $ 10m / year for 5 years in x - ray optics technologies , comparable to nasa s investment in astro - e or a smex , is needed , and would pay off hugely more than any small x - ray mission . </S>"
