    "in the situation of very strong electron - phonon coupling , non - adiabatic effects of electron - ion system will be so important that the electrons are dressed heavily by lattice vibrations and the conventional strong - coupling theory@xcite need be generalized to include the non - adiabatic effects or the vertex corrects beyond migdal s theorem .",

    "the effective phonon energies are distributed from 50 mev to 80 mev .",
    "the coulomb interactions are strong in cuprate superconductors @xmath76=0.25 .",
    "we can clearly see from fig.[fig2](b ) and fig.[fig3](c ) that in underdoped samples , t@xmath0 can be reduced to very small values in strong electron - phonon interaction region ( @xmath6@xmath792.5 ) due to the interplay interaction between vertex correction and strong coulomb interaction . as shown in fig.[fig5](b ) , the values of t@xmath0 for all samples are reduced from around 200 k to lower than 150 k and close to experimental values  @xcite .",

    "the cooper - pairs pre - form at the mean field value t@xmath96 of transition temperature in standard strong - coupling theory .",
    "however strong non - adiabatic effects induce the instability of cooper - pairs and suppress real t@xmath0 to lower values .",
    "the t@xmath100 degenerates with t@xmath0 in overdoped region is similar to the example ( 1 ) of fig.9 in ref.@xcite .    for the iron - based superconductors",
    "ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 studied in ref.@xcite , the parameters of boson - phonon interaction decrease from 3.42 to 0.78 with increasing temperature .",
    "the contributions of electron - phonon interactions have energies lower than 40 mev in eliashberg functions @xmath1 . at 28",
    "k close to t@xmath0 , the roughly estimated value of @xmath6 contributed by energies lower than 40 mev is about 2.0 close to the values at temperature 86 k. this is too strong to account to experimental t@xmath0=28 k. because the effective phonon energy is about 20 - 40 mev , the reduced t@xmath0 from the vertex corrections are also small ( fig.[fig1 ] ) although the effective band - widths of conducting electrons are small from 1 ev to 2 ev .",
    "the key problem is that how we can extract the more accurate value of @xmath6 of electron - phonon interaction from total @xmath6 .",
    "if we use the @xmath6=1.44 obtained at temperature 151 k and the effective phonon energy @xmath7=20 mev , the obtained t@xmath0=29 k is close to experimental t@xmath0=28 k. the reasonable value for iron - based superconductor is about @xmath6=1.0 .",
    "this is indicative that the contribution of electron - phonon interaction to eliashberg function @xmath1 dominates over other interactions at high temperature .    from fig.[fig4 ]",
    ", we can see that if effective band - width e@xmath77 is small , the t@xmath0 will decrease with increasing phonon frequency if @xmath7 is higher enough .",
    "this means that we can not increase t@xmath0 infinitely by decreasing mass of atom or increasing phonon frequency .",
    "the strong vertex corrections in high phonon - energy region suppress t@xmath0 to smaller values than those of predicted by standard strong - coupling theory .",
    "this is a reasonable explanation for the lower t@xmath0 in the experiment of silane superconductor  @xcite than that in the strong - coupling theory  @xcite .",
    "the superconductivity of fullerides can be described using cooper - pairs glued by virtual phonon excitation .",
    "however there are some very important problems are unsolved  @xcite .",
    "the fullerides have very large number of phonon modes from low frequency to high frequency .",
    "what phonon modes are most important to their superconductivity ? .",
    "there are two groups of phonon modes of fullerides : ( a ) inter - molecular molecular modes with energies lower than 150@xmath101 ( or 18 mev ) and ( b ) intra - molecular phonon modes with energies higher than 250 @xmath101 ( or 31 mev ) .",
    "the inter - molecular modes have small contributions to t@xmath0 due to their lower energies and not too strong electron - phonon interaction .",
    "most importantly , our results shown in fig.[fig1](c ) and fig.[fig4 ] prove that the ` tangential ' intra - molecular modes with energy higher than 1000 @xmath101 ( or 124 mev ) have small contributions to t@xmath0 because of strong vertex corrections .",
    "so the intra - molecular ` radial ' modes from 250@xmath101 to 1000@xmath101 of group ( b ) should contribute main parts of superconductivity .",
    "in fact effective phonon frequency @xmath42 is located in this energy range .",
    "the empty t@xmath102 orbits will form narrow energy bands with width about 500 mev in c@xmath62 solid and strongly couple with intra - molecular h@xmath103 phonons . in rb@xmath61c@xmath62",
    "solid , the width of t@xmath102 bands increase to about 1 ev and is half filled with electrons . based on our calculations using density functional theory with plane - wave pseudo - potential methods ,",
    "the effective band - width e@xmath77 is higher than 500 mev and lower than 1 ev . if we choose the intra - molecular radial mode @xmath7=525 @xmath101 ( or 65 mev ) and the half - width e@xmath77=500 mev , t@xmath0 will be lower than experimental value due to vertex - correction effects shown in fig.[fig5](a ) .",
    "if we slightly increase e@xmath77 and use the averaged value e@xmath77=750 mev , both t@xmath0=29.5 k and isotope coefficient @xmath104  @xcite are close to the values in experiments if @xmath6=1.04 and @xmath76=0.1 .",
    "the required parameter @xmath6 is different from our previous work value 0.66  @xcite in the calculation without vertex correction , however still close to the reasonable range from 0.5 to 1.0  @xcite .",
    "the accurate calculations of @xmath6 and @xmath76 are important to understand the role of vertex correction .",
    "in summary , the strong - coupling eliashberg theory including vertex correction is systemically studied in this paper .",
    "the t@xmath0 maps in parameter - space @xmath6-@xmath105-@xmath76 for different e@xmath77 contain the completed information on strong - coupling theory and the vertex corrections .",
    "especially , the combined interaction of vertex correction and coulomb interaction can significantly depress t@xmath0 to small value .",
    "the non - monotonous changes of t@xmath0 with increasing @xmath6 show the crossover behaviors near @xmath6=2 when @xmath6 evolving from weak - coupling region to strong - coupling region .",
    "the crossovers can explain the doping - dependent t@xmath0 of cuprate superconductors if the coulomb interactions are strong .",
    "the crossover behavior in @xmath7-dependent t@xmath0 indicates that high - frequency phonon is unfavorable to high t@xmath0 .",
    "thus the strong non - adiabatic effect makes it hard to find high t@xmath0 superconductors in compounds containing light elements .",
    "finally the t@xmath0 maps in the previous paper  @xcite and the maps with vertex corrections in this paper provide very comprehensive understanding of superconductivity of superconductors .",

    "<S> the strong coupling eliashberg theory plus vertex correction is used to calculate the maps of transition temperature ( t@xmath0 ) in parameter - space characterizing superconductivity . based on these t@xmath0 maps , </S>",
    "<S> complex crossovers are found when electron - phonon interaction increases from weak - coupling region to strong coupling region . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the interplay interaction between vertex correction and coulomb interaction reduces the higher t@xmath0 predicted in standard eliashberg theory to the lower t@xmath0 observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the doping - dependent t@xmath0 of cuprate superconductors can be explained as the effect of vertex correction in standard eliashberg theory and , most importantly , the pseudo - gap can be explained as the effect of vertex correction . </S>",
    "<S> our results are also indicated that the non - adiabatic effect is the barrier for the realizations of high t@xmath0 in compounds with compositions of light atoms and with high phonon frequencies . </S>"
