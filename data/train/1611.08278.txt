    "[ fig : component ]    in @xmath0 decays , one distinguishes between two types of charge - parity ( @xmath4 ) violation : direct and indirect @xmath4 violations which are parametrized by @xmath7 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "both types of @xmath4 violation have been quantified by many kaon experiments precisely .",
    "while @xmath3 is a per mille effect in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath7 is smaller by another three orders of magnitude : @xmath8 .",
    "this strong suppression comes from the suppression of the isospin-@xmath9 amplitude w.r.t .  the isospin-@xmath10 amplitude ( @xmath11 rule ) and an accidental cancellation of leading contributions in the sm . in fig .",
