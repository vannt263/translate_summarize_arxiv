    "during the last decades , the size of electronic circuits has continuously been reduced .",
    "today , systems like quantum wires and quantum dots are routinely produced on the nanometer scale .",
    "recently , the seemingly ultimate limit of minituarization has been achieved by several experimental groups who were able to place single molecules between two macroscopic electrodes .",
    "@xcite to describe transport properties on such a small scale , a quantum theory of transport is required.@xcite    a cornerstone of such a theory is the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite which provides a method to compute the steady - state current of non - interacting electrons for meso- or nanoscopic systems connecting two ( or more ) macroscopic electrodes .    alternatively , the technique of nonequilibrium green functions ( neg ) @xcite has been used to tackle quantum transport .",
    "studies using the neg approach typically use tight - binding - like model hamiltonians to describe the combined system electrodes plus `` device '' .",
    "a well known scheme is the one introduced by caroli _",
    "@xcite in the remote past the left and right electrodes are disconnected and in equilibrium at two different chemical potentials ; the conducting part of the hamiltonian is switched on adiabatically and eventually a steady - state develops . within this contacting approach also",
    "time - dependent transport phenomena have been investigated .",
    "@xcite caroli _",
    "discussed non - interacting systems only .",
    "their approach has later been extended to account for short - range electron - electron interaction and for interaction with vibrations in the device region.@xcite an excellent overview of the field can be found in the book by haug and jauho @xcite and in ref .  .",
    "despite its appeal , the above scheme has limitations since the time - dependent perturbation is the tunneling hamiltonian , connecting the electrodes to the device , rather than the external electric field .",
    "cini proposed another scheme @xcite also based on neg . here ,",
    "the system electrodes plus `` device '' is connected and in equilibrium in the remote past .",
    "the time - dependent perturbation is the external scalar potential .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for non - interacting systems the contacting approach and the cini approach yield the same current in the long - time limit and that in the dc case the steady state current does not depend on the history of the applied potential . moreover ,",
    "the cini scheme is well suited for a density functional extension since the electrons are driven out of equilibrium by a local potential rather than by a non - local one ( see below ) .    with recent experimental progress to place single molecules as devices between macroscopic electrodes",
    "there also has been considerable activity to describe transport through these systems on an _ ab initio _ level .",
    "most approaches are based on a self - consistency procedure first proposed by lang.@xcite in this steady - state approach based on density functional theory ( dft ) , exchange and correlation is approximated by the static kohn - sham ( ks ) potential and the charge density is obtained self - consistently in the presence of the steady current",
    ". however , the original justification involved subtle points such as different fermi levels deep inside the left and right electrodes and the implicit reference of non - local perturbations such as tunneling hamiltonians within a dft framework .",
    "( for a detailed discussion we refer to ref . .",
    ") the steady - state dft approach has been further developed @xcite and the results have been most useful for understanding the qualitative behavior of measured current - voltage characteristics .",
    "quantitatively , however , the theoretical i - v curves often differ from the experimental ones by several orders of magnitude.@xcite several explanations are possible for such a mismatch : models are not sufficiently refined , parasitic effects in measurements have been underestimated , the characteristics of the molecule - contact interface are not well understood and difficult to address given their atomistic complexity . adding to the theoretical reason for this discrepancy is the fact that the transmission functions computed from static dft have resonances at the non - interacting kohn - sham excitation energies which in general do not coincide with the true excitation energies .",
    "furthermore , different exchange - correlation functionals lead to dft - currents that vary by more than an order of magnitude.@xcite    excitation energies of interacting systems are accessible via time - dependent ( td ) dft.@xcite in this theory , the time - dependent density of an interacting system moving in an external , time - dependent local potential can be calculated via a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons moving in a local , effective time - dependent potential .",
    "therefore this theory is in principle well suited for the treatment of nonequilibrium transport problems.@xcite a basic issue is that most exchange - correlation functionals have been derived under equilibrium conditions and their application to non - equilibrium problems should be analyzed in more detail .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the present work .    before a tddft calculation of transport",
    "can be tackled , a number of technical problems have to be addressed . in particular , one needs a practical scheme for the propagation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for an infinitely large system .",
    "of course , since one can in practice only deal with finite systems this can only be achieved by applying the correct boundary conditions .",
    "the problem of so - called `` transparent boundary conditions '' for the time - dependent schrdinger equation has been attacked by many authors . for a recent overview ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref .  .",
    "in this paper we present a propagation scheme which is particularly designed to be used for the calculation of time - dependent transport problems . in section [ secii ] , we combine the cini scheme with tddft and we develop a general formalism based on the propagation of kohn - sham orbitals in open systems . in section [ seciii ] we will address the question of how to obtain the correct initial states for the propagation . an algorithm for the time - evolution of open systems",
    "is proposed in section [ seciv ] .",
    "it is based on a modified version of the crank - nicholson algorithm .",
    "section  [ details ] describes some details of our numerical implementation and section  [ examples ] gives results for several one - dimensional model systems .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "we consider an electrode - junction - electrode system which is initially in equilibrium ( @xmath0 ) . the system is contacted and no current flows through the junction , the charge density of the electrodes being perfectly balanced , see fig .",
    "[ system ] .",
    "therefore , the system initially is in its ground state which , due to the hohenberg - kohn theorem,@xcite is a functional of the density .",
    "this density can then be computed in the usual way by @xmath1 where the sum is over the occupied kohn - sham orbitals @xmath2 , i.e. , the eigenfunctions of the kohn - sham hamiltonian @xmath3 with eigenergy below the fermi energy . here and in the following we use boldface notation to denote operators in one - electron hilbert space .",
    "schematic diagram of the system described in the main text for the calculation of charge transport through the central constriction . ]    to observe a current we drive the system out of equilibrium by exposing the electrons to an external electric potential ( bias ) . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume that this external bias vanishes for times @xmath4 .",
    "according to the runge - gross theorem @xcite , the time - dependent density can be calculated by evolving the ks orbitals according to the ks equation of tddft @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the time - dependent ks hamiltonian .",
    "thus , @xmath7 and the continuity equation is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 $ ] is the ks current density . due to the runge - gross theorem and the continuity equation one can deduce that the longitudinal part of the ks current density equals the longitudinal part of the true current density . this need not be true for the transverse part of the current density .",
    "however , the transverse part of the current density does not contribute to the total current which can then be calculated by a surface integral @xmath10 , \\label{curror}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the unit vector perpendicular to the surface element @xmath12 and the surface @xmath13 is perpendicular to the longitudinal geometry of our system . in order to propagate the ks orbitals we need to solve the schrdinger equation for a macroscopic and non - periodic system .",
    "this goal is hopeless unless we know the dynamics of the remote parts of the system . we restrict ourselves to metallic electrodes",
    "then , the external potential and the disturbance introduced by the device region are screened deep inside the electrodes .",
    "as the system size increases , the remote parts are less disturbed by the junction and the density inside the electrodes approaches the equilibrium bulk - density .",
    "thus , the macroscopic size of the electrodes leads to an enormous simplification since the initial - state self - consistency is not disturbed far away from the constriction .",
    "it is convenient to partition the system into three main regions : a central region @xmath14 consisting of the junction and a few atomic layers of the left and right electrodes and two regions @xmath15 , @xmath16 which describe the left and right bulk electrodes .",
    "only the central device region @xmath14 will be treated explicitly .",
    "our scheme accounts for the full dynamical screening in the central region",
    ". it can be further refined by taking into account screening effects also deeper in the electrodes at the level of linear response , with a limited increase in numerical efforts .",

    "[ examp1 ] the transient current can exceed the steady current ; the higher the applied voltage the larger is this excess current and the shorter is the time when it reaches its maximum .",

    "for small bias the electrons at the bottom of the band are not disturbed and the transient process is exponentially short . on the other hand , for a bias close to the fermi energy the transient process decays as a power law , due to the band edge singularity . as pointed out in ref .",

    "however , the transient current clearly depends on how the bias is switched on .    in the final example",

    "previous work on time - dependent quantum transport mainly uses the idea of caroli.@xcite this approach is at the core of the landauer derivation and has the problem of using different chemical potentials in different parts of the system .",
    "this implies that the initial state is not a ground state of the entire , contacted system .",
    "furthermore , the time - dependent perturbation is a tunneling hamiltonian which is nonlocal in space .",
    "therefore , it can not be combined with tddft since there the time - dependent potential is local .    here",
    ", we have used the scheme of cini @xcite which can be combined with tddft : we start the calculation from a well - defined thermodynamic equilibrium configuration , therefore the scheme is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "then we apply an external potential that in general is time dependent . by virtue of the runge - gross theorem ,",
    "the time - evolution of this quantum system is completely determined by the knowledge of the time - dependent density . in the steady state regime",
    "the occupation of left and right moving carriers is dictated by the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "another thermodynamically consistent scheme has been put forward by kamenev and kohn . @xcite they used the microscopic quantum - kinetic formulation of conductivity and worked with the kubo formula  @xcite in the linear time - dependent hartree regime .",
    "they consider a closed system ( ring ) where the current in the system results from an external driving vector potential .",
    "this approach also overcomes the problem of having two chemical potentials .",
    "they have shown that it is possible to recover the landauer result , _",
    "i.e. _ , the universal quantum of conductance @xmath246 independent of the length and material . since the kamenev - kohn approach uses a vector potential rather than a scalar potential , time - dependent current dft rather than tddft would be the natural density - functional extension .",
    "most theoretical approaches to transport in molecular electronic devices adopt open boundary conditions and assume that transport is ballistic , _",
    "i.e. _ , under steady state conditions inelastic collisions are absent from a molecular structure and its contacts .",
    "@xcite dissipation occurs only in the idealized macroscopic reservoirs connected by leads to the molecular device .",
    "this central role of the reservoirs in the process of dissipation is a valid approximation , particularly when the applied bias is small and a device operates in a linear regime .",
    "when inelastic scattering dominates this picture is not applicable . in particular , experiments @xcite indicate that inelastic scattering with lattice vibrations is present at sufficiently large bias , causing local heating of contacts and molecular devices .",
    "energy transfer to the lattice may also cause atomic migration and result in dramatic changes in the device characteristics ( also they may give phonon replica structure in the measured conductance ) .",
    "the modelling of a many - electron system out of equilibrium coupled to lattice vibrations is a real theoretical challenge .",
    "@xcite    electron correlations are also important in molecular conductors , for example , coulomb blockade effects dominate the transport in quantum dots .",
    "short - range electron correlations seems to be relevant in order to get quantitative description of i / v characteristics in molecular constrictions .",
    "@xcite in particular it is commonly assumed that the energy scales for electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions are different and could be treated separately .",
    "however , the metallic screening of the electrodes considerably reduces the coulomb - charging energy ( from ev to mev scale ) . in this regime",
    "the energy scale for the two interactions merge and they need to be treated on the same footing posing some additional theoretical challenge .",
    "other approaches put forward in the literature directly look for a homogeneous current - carrying state either based on a a maximum entropy principle @xcite or by a imposing the current through lagrange - multipliers.@xcite in those approaches it is implicitly assumed that the origin of the homogeneous current is independent whether it is introduced by reservoirs or by external fields .",
    "this is indeed the case for independent electrons but once dissipation is built in the system might exhibit a dependence on the history of the applied bias,(_e.g .",
    "_ , possible appearance of hysteresis loop in the current versus voltage characteristics ) .",
    "it is clear that the quality of the tddft functionals is of crucial importance . in particular ,",
    "exchange and correlation functionals for the non - equilibrium situation are required .",
    "time - dependent linear response theory for dc - steady state has been implemented in ref .   within tdlda assuming jellium - like electrodes ( mimicked by complex absorbing / emitting potentials ) .",
    "it has been shown that the dc - conductance changes considerably from the standard landauer value .",
    "therefore , a systematic study of the tddft functionals themselves is needed .",
    "a step beyond standard adiabatic approximations and exchange - only potentials is to resort to many - body schemes as recently done for the characterization of optical properties of semiconductors and insulators .",
    "@xcite another path is to explore in depth the fact that the true exchange - correlation potential is current dependent .",
