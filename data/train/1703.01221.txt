    "by contrast with theorem of @xcite ( and theorem of @xcite ) , the results obtained in this paper ( ) do not provide a complete description ( under the form of an asymptotic pattern , a `` standing terrace '' ) for the behaviour of the solution in the `` center '' area between the two stacked families of fronts travelling to the left and to the right .",

    "the proof proceeds by contradiction and uses the expression ( valid in the `` parabolic '' case ) : @xmath789 together with a hlder inequality , leading to the non - integrability of the function @xmath790 and to a contradiction with the fact that the residual asymptotic energy @xmath672 is not equal to @xmath213 ( since nonnegative ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the hyperbolic case considered here , expression [ space_der_ham_parab ] turns ( at least formally ) into the less tractable expression : @xmath791 that i have not been able to use to achieve the conclusions of lemma of @xcite .",
