    "the determination of the cross section of a reference trigger process ( @xmath1 ) allows a scale normalization for other cross - section measurements in the experiment , and enables the calculation of the luminosity @xmath2 using the trigger process rate @xmath3 , via a relation @xmath4 . in the alice",

    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 for a given process @xmath7 is defined as the ratio between the process yield in aa collisions @xmath8 and the yield expected by scaling the @xmath5 cross - section @xmath9 by the average nuclear overlap function @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",

    "thus a precision of the order of 5% on @xmath9 is desired in order not to be dominant in the overall uncertainty ,",
    "for the present study , the cross section ( @xmath13 ) of the process triggered by two scintillator arrays ( v0)@xcite has been measured as the reference .",
    "the arrays are asymmetrically placed at @xmath14 ( v0a ) and @xmath15 ( v0c ) . in each array",
    "the scintillator tiles are arranged in 2 ( radial ) @xmath16 16 ( azimuthal ) segments with individual photomultiplier - tube readout .",
    "32 logic signals of each array after applying pulse height thresholds are combined into a logical `` or '' .",
    "the two resulting signals are combined with an `` and '' logic with 25 ns of coincidence window , to reduce the sensitivity to backgrounds .",
    "in the vdm scan@xcite , the luminosity @xmath2 ( thus trigger rate @xmath17 ) is varied by changing the distance between the two beams horizontally by @xmath18 and vertically by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 being the plane transverse to the beam axis ) .",
