    "the lorentz gas has proved to be a useful model for studying the relations between dynamical systems theory and non - equilibrium properties of many body systems .",
    "this model consists of a set of scatterers that are fixed in space together with moving particles that collide with the scatterers .",
    "here we consider the version of the model in two dimensions where the scatterers are fixed hard disks , placed at random in the plane without overlapping .",
    "each of the moving particles is a point particle with a mass and a charge , and is subjected to an external , uniform electric field as well as a gaussian thermostat which is designed to keep the kinetic energy of the moving particle at a constant value .",
    "the particles make elastic , specular collisions with the scatterers , but do not interact with each other .",
    "the interest in the lorentz gas model stems from the fact that its chaotic properties can be analyzed in some detail , at least if the scatterers form a sufficiently dilute , quenched gas , so that the average distance between scatterers is large compared to their radii .",
    "the interest in a thermostatted electric field arises from the fact that at small fields a transport coefficient , the electrical conductivity of the particles , is proportional to the sum of the lyapunov exponents describing the chaotic motion of the moving particle @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are to be calculated for the case where the charged particle is described by a non - equilibrium steady state phase - space distribution function which is reached from some typical initial distribution function after a sufficiently long period of time . in this state , the distribution function for an ensemble of moving particles ( all interacting with the scatterers and the field , but not with each other ) is independent of time and its average over the distribution of scatterers is spatially homogeneous . it is known from computer simulations @xcite and theoretical discussions @xcite that in the stationary state the trajectories of the moving particles in phase space lie on a fractal attractor of lower dimension than the dimension of the constant energy surface , which is three dimensional for the constant energy lorentz gas in two dimensions .",
    "there can be at most two non - zero lyapunov exponents for this model since the lyapunov exponent in the direction of the phase - space trajectory is zero .",
    "also , the relation between the lyapunov exponents and the electrical conductivity requires that the sum of the non - zero exponents should be negative due to the positivity of electrical conductivity @xcite .",
    "the case of the dilute , random lorentz gas has already been studied in detail .",
    "van beijeren and coworkers @xcite have calculated the lyapunov spectrum for an equilibrium lorentz gas in two and three dimensions using various kinetic theory methods including boltzmann equation techniques .",
    "these methods were also applied to the dilute , random lorentz gas in a thermostatted electric field with results for the lyapunov exponents that are in excellent agreement with computer simulations @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the results for the field - dependent case were in accord with the relation between the electrical conductivity and the lyapunov exponents for the moving particle .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the results obtained for the lyapunov exponents for dilute lorentz gases to higher densities .",
    "our central themes will be : ( a ) to describe a general method , based upon the bbgky hierarchy equations , for accomplishing this task , and ( b ) to examine the effects on the lyapunov exponents of long range in time correlations between the moving particle and the scatterers produced by correlated collision sequences where the particle collides with a given scatterer more than once and the time interval between such re - collisions is on the order of several mean free times , with an arbitrary number of intermediate collisions with other scatterers .",
    "these correlated collision sequences are of particular interest in kinetic and transport theory because they are responsible for the `` long - time - tail '' effects in the green - kubo time correlation functions , which lead to various divergences in the transport coefficients for two and three dimensional gases , where all of the particles move @xcite . in the case of a lorentz gas in @xmath5 dimensions , the green - kubo velocity correlation functions decay with time , @xmath6 , as @xmath7 @xcite and",
    "the diffusion coefficient is finite in both two and three dimensions .",
    "here we describe the effects of these type of correlations on the lyapunov exponents for the two - dimensional lorentz gas , in equilibrium , where we find no effect , and in a thermostatted electric field , where we find a small , logarithmic dependence of the lyapunov exponents upon the applied field .",
    "this logarithmic effect is an indicator for similar effects to be expected when one calculates lyapunov exponents associated with more general transport in two - dimensional gases , whereas in three dimensional systems one would expect corresponding non - analytic terms proportional to @xmath8 . in the case of the lorentz gas , at least , the logarithmic terms",
    "can easily be associated with the logarithmic terms that appear in the field dependent collision frequency , and a very simple argument can be used to establish this relation between logarithmic terms in the lyapunov exponents and in the collision frequency .    in section 2 of this article",
    "we describe the general theory of lyapunov exponents of a two - dimensional thermostatted electric field - driven lorentz gas and quote the results within the scope of the boltzmann equation . in section 3 , we generalize the theory to incorporate the effect of correlated collision sequences . in section 4 ,",
    "we outline the calculation of the effects of the correlated collision sequences on the non - zero lyapunov exponents using the bbgky equations discussed in section 3 and obtain the non - analytic field - dependent term in the lyapunov exponents , originating from the correlated collision sequences , along with other analytic field - dependent terms . in section 5 , we present some simple arguments explaining the field - dependence of the collision frequency and show that this is the sole origin of the non - analytic , field - dependent terms in the lyapunov exponents .",
    "notice that the arguments given in section 5 are independent of and much simpler to follow than the formalism developed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a discussion of the results obtained here , and with a consideration of open questions .",
    "methods for determination of the field - dependence of the collision frequency are outlined in the appendix .",
    "the random lorentz gas consists of point particles of mass @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 moving in a random array of fixed scatterers . in two dimensions ,",
    "each scatterer is a hard disk of radius @xmath11 .",
    "the disks do not overlap with each other and are distributed with number density @xmath12 , such that at low density @xmath13 .",
    "the point particles are acted upon by a uniform , constant electric field @xmath14 in the @xmath15 direction , but there is no interaction between any two point particles . there is also a gaussian thermostat in the system to keep the speed of each particle constant at @xmath16 by means of a dynamical friction during flights between collisions with the scatterers",

    "we will normally use @xmath31 , though from time to time we will use @xmath2 , too .    treating this two - dimensional lorentz gas as a dynamical system ,",
    "we define the lyapunov exponents in the usual way : a point particle in its phase space @xmath32 starts at time @xmath33 at a phase space location @xmath34 . under time evolution , @xmath35 follows a trajectory in this phase space which we call the `` reference trajectory '' .",
    "we consider an infinitesimally displaced trajectory which starts at the same time @xmath33 , but at @xmath36 . under time",
    "evolution , @xmath37 follows another trajectory , always staying infinitesimally close to the reference trajectory .",
    "this trajectory we call the `` adjacent trajectory '' .",
    "typically the two trajectories will separate in time due to the convex nature of the collisions .",
    "thus , we can define the positive lyapunov exponent as @xmath38 for a typical trajectory of the system .",
    "we assume that , for small fields , this lorentz gas system is hyperbolic .",
    "since the two - dimensional lorentz gas can have at most two nonzero lyapunov exponents , we denote the negative lyapunov exponent by @xmath39 . without any loss of generality , we can choose to measure the separation of the reference and adjacent trajectories equivalently in @xmath40-space , thereby reducing the definition of the positive lyapunov exponent to @xmath41 in order to calculate the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) , we introduce another dynamical quantity , the radius of curvature @xmath42 , characterizing the spatial separation of the two trajectories ( see fig .",

    "the radius of curvature associated with the particle on the reference trajectory at time @xmath6 is then given by @xmath47 having defined @xmath48 , one can make a simple geometric argument to show that @xmath49 so as to obtain a version of sinai s formula @xcite , @xmath50    during a flight , the equation of motion for @xmath42 is given by @xcite @xmath51 at a collision with a scatterer , the post - collisional velocity angle @xmath52 and radius of curvature @xmath53 are related to the pre - collisional velocity angle @xmath54 and radius of curvature @xmath55 by @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the collision angle , i.e , @xmath58 ( see fig .",

    "the boltzmann theory for the lyapunov exponents assumes that the scatterers form a dilute , but quenched system and that the collisions of the point particles with the scatterers are uncorrelated . to incorporate the effects of correlated collisions on the lyapunov exponents",
    ", we will use a method based on the bbgky hierarchy equations , familiar from the kinetic theory of moderately dense gases @xcite . since the moving particles do not interact with each other ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider the distribution functions for just one of them , together with a number of scatterers .",
    "one starts from a fundamental equation for an @xmath76-body distribution function , @xmath77 , which is the probability density function in the entire extended phase space @xmath78 spanned by the variables @xmath79 , describing our system of @xmath80 scatterers and one moving particle .",

    "since the time evolution of @xmath40 and @xmath83 in this field is not hamiltonian , we must use the liouville equation in the form of a conservation law , rather than the usual form for hamiltonian systems , to obtain @xmath84 here the operators @xmath85 are binary collision operators which describe the effects on the distribution function due to an instantaneous , elastic collision between the moving particle and the scatterer labeled by the index @xmath86 .",

    "the last two contributions have to cancel , as we demonstrate in the appendix . in the presence of a field , however , this cancellation does not occur .",

    "this effect enhances the probability of a recollision in comparison to that for an isotropic distribution around the scatterer . in a  virtual collision \" , in which the velocity does not change , the particle , on average , ends up downstream ( i.e. in the direction of the applied field ) from the virtual scatterer and its recollision probability is decreased compared to that for an isotropic distribution .    in the appendix , a quantitative calculation",
    "is given based on the following two assumptions : + 1 ) after the real or virtual collision the spatial distribution of the point particle becomes centered around a point at a distance of a diffusion length from the scatterer and + 2 ) for long times this distribution can be found by solving the diffusion equation .",
    "the resulting expression for @xmath358 is @xmath359    a more formal , but equivalent , way to obtain this result is by extending the method described by latz , van beijeren and dorfman @xcite for the low density distribution of time of free flights of the moving particle to include the contribution from ring events , so as to apply to a system in a thermostatted electric field .",
    "the main idea is to solve a kinetic equation for @xmath360 , the distribution of particles at a phase point @xmath361 at time @xmath6 such that their last collision took place at a time @xmath362 earlier , i.e. , at time @xmath363 .",

    "since we want to show that the origin of the non - analytic field dependence of both @xmath158 and @xmath39 is rooted in the non - analytic field dependence of collision frequency @xmath358 , let us keep only the non - analytic field - dependent term as the leading term of the expansion of @xmath358 in the density of scatterers and in the electric field strength and write @xmath365 where the quantity @xmath366 has to be determined from the ness average of @xmath362 , using the effect of the ring term on the ness distribution function @xmath367 with @xmath368 of the order of @xmath369 . to obtain this distribution function , we follow exactly the same procedure as outlined in sections 4 and 5 , but this time , with the variable @xmath362 instead of @xmath42 .",
    "notice that , this time , even though the equations for corresponding @xmath129 and @xmath160 s are different , due to the difference in the dynamical equations for @xmath370 and @xmath371 during free flights and at collisions , the equations involving @xmath144 and @xmath228 s remain the same .",
    "the source of the non - analytic field - dependent term will surface again exactly from the @xmath372 term in eq .",
    "( [ e54 ] ) . as far as this non - analytic field - dependent term is concerned , at the lowest order of density ,",
    "the variables @xmath42 and @xmath362 are identical up to a multiplicative factor @xmath16 .",
    "both grow linearly with time in between collisions and are set back to ( for @xmath42 , almost ) zero at each collision with a scatterer .",
    "one then recovers the corresponding non - analytic part of the ness distribution function @xcite , analogous to eq .",

    "while much of this paper is quite technical , there are two main points that we would like to emphasize : ( 1 ) we have developed a method which allows an extension of the calculation of the lyapunov exponents for a two - dimensional lorentz gas to higher densities than is possible by means of the elbe .",
    "( 2 ) the logarithmic terms obtained here , while small , are indicators of similar logarithmic terms which are certain to appear when these calculations are extended to general two - dimensional gases , where all of the particles move .",
    "the first point allows one to contemplate a general kinetic theory for the calculation of of sums , at least , of all positive , or of all negative lyapunov exponents .",
    "such an approach was also indicated by dorfman , latz , and van beijeren @xcite , for the ks - entropy of a dilute gas in equilibrium , but the theory there has not yet been developed beyond the boltzmann equation .",
    "the relevance of the second point can be seen if one realizes that the linear navier - stokes transport coefficients of a two - dimensional gas diverge because of long time tail effects , of the type discussed here @xcite . in the general gas case therefore the logarithmic terms in the positive and negative lyapunov exponents will not cancel as they do here , because the transport coefficients themselves should diverge as @xmath375 as @xmath31 approaches zero . thus the logarithmic terms obtained here should be seen as precursors of the more important logarithmic terms that will appear in the theory of two - dimensional gases .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath376 term results from a long range correlation in time between the moving particle and the scatterers that is present in both the pair correlation functions , @xmath200 , and @xmath123 , either of which is proportional to the square of the electric field strength and the inverse square of the wave number , at small wave numbers and fields .",
    "this dependence is not present in the lorentz gas in equilibrium , of course , but similar collision frequency arguments to those given here suggest that non - analytic terms may be present in the ring contributions to the positive lyapunov exponent for trajectories on the fractal repeller for an open lorentz gas . in this case",
    "the inverse system size , @xmath377 , plays the role of @xmath299 , the lower limit of @xmath272 for the integration over @xmath205 and one would expect to find terms of order @xmath378 in the ring term for this case .",
    "this point is currently under investigation .",
    "finally we mention that neither the non - analytic terms found here , nor the excluded volume corrections included in the enskog terms are able to account for the field dependence of the lyapunov exponents as observed in the computer simulations by dellago and posch @xcite .",
    "this is not unexpected since we have not been systematic in computing the density dependence of the coefficient of @xmath278 , nor have we considered higher order terms in @xmath31 beyond order @xmath379 .",
    "all of the neglected terms are likely to be numerically more important than the ones we have kept .",
    "there is also no indication in the simulation data for the lyapunov exponents of a clear presence of the interesting logarithmic term in the applied field .",
    "such logarithmic terms are typically difficult to detect in simulation data , without a careful hunt for them@xcite",
    ". however , it may be easier to check , by means of computer simulation , the existence of the @xmath376 term in the collision frequency than in the lyapunov exponents . in any case",
    ", we would like to emphasize that computer simulation studies of thermostatted systems provide very useful ways to check a number of phenomena predicted by the kinetic theory of moderately dense gases .",

    "this assumption for the long time distribution may be understood by imagining that the first few free flights after the initial collision of the particle move it over a distance in the order of a mean free path in the direction of its initial postcollisional velocity before it starts to diffuse by virtue of further collisions with scatterers .",
    "thus for large @xmath362 the distribution of the light particle will be centered around the point @xmath395 with respect to the center of the scatterer , and the final point , on the surface of the scatterer , may be approximated to be at the center of the scatterer as well , because of low density .",
