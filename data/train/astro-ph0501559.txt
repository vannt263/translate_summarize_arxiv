    "recently correlations between various energies characterizing gamma - ray bursts have been reported ( amati et al . 2002 , henceforth a02 ; ghirlanda , ghisellini & lazzati 2004 , henceforth g04 ) .",
    "if true , these correlations have significant implications for burst physics , and could supplement incomplete observations in compiling burst databases . building on nakar & piran ( 2005 , henceforth np05 ) , we test these relations for consistency with a subset of the bursts observed by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) that flew on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro)_. note that consistency would not prove the validity of these relations .",
    "a02 found that the peak energy @xmath0 , the energy of the maximum of @xmath6 for the entire burst , and the apparent isotropic energy @xmath1 , the total burst energy if the observed flux were radiated in all directions , are related : @xmath7 .",
    "this is the amati relation .",
    "subsequently g04 found that @xmath0 and the actual emitted energy @xmath2 are even more tightly correlated : @xmath8 .",
    "this is the ghirlanda relation . in these relations",
    "@xmath0 is in the burst frame , and is found by fitting the spectrum of the ` fluence spectrum , ' the spectrum formed from summing all the burst emission .",
    "@xmath1 is calculated from the observed bolometric energy fluence using the burst redshift , while @xmath2 is determined from @xmath1 with corrections for the beaming of the gamma - ray emission derived from analyzing afterglows .",
    "these relations were discovered and calibrated using the small number of bursts for which afterglows and redshifts have been determined .",
    "the calibrating burst database is small and heterogeneous enough that the fitted parameters of these relations are sensitive to the editing of the burst database ; for example , see friedman & bloom ( 2005 , henceforth fb05 ) .",
    "in addition , the sample is subject to selection effects resulting from localizing the burst in different wavebands , tracking the afterglow , and determining the redshift of the afterglow or the host galaxy .",
    "np05 pointed out that while larger burst databases lack the redshifts necessary to calibrate the amati relation , these databases can test the validity of this relation because the ratio @xmath9 can not exceed a maximum value for all redshifts .",
    "they found that a large fraction of the bursts in the databases they considered can not satisfy the amati relation .",
    "we build on the work of np05 using a database of 760 batse bursts with observed @xmath10 and fluences , and test both the amati and ghirlanda relations . to calculate @xmath2 for the ghirlanda relation we need the beaming fraction @xmath3 , for which an afterglow must be detected and monitored .",
    "the most rigorous test assumes @xmath4 , in which case the ghirlanda relation becomes the amati relation@xmath11 when @xmath4albeit with a different exponent for @xmath0 .",
    "we find that indeed a large fraction of the bursts in our sample are inconsistent with the amati relation , as np05 found , but only a small fraction are inconsistent with the ghirlanda relation under the extreme condition that @xmath4 .",
    "these rigorous tests of these two relations put bursts at the redshift that maximizes the @xmath9 and @xmath12 ratios , and for the ghirlanda relation assumes the extreme value @xmath4",
    ". however , we can create less rigorous yet still relevant tests by comparing the observed distributions of these ratios to calculated distributions based on model redshift and beaming fraction distributions . applying this model dependent test , we find that the observed and model distributions are discrepant , although the discrepancy is less extreme for the ghirlanda relation than for the amati relation .",
    "redshifts have been calculated for batse bursts assuming empirical relations such as the lag - luminosity ( see band , norris & bonnell 2004 ) and @xmath0-luminosity relations ( yonetoku et al . 2004 , henceforth y04 ) .",
    "we do not use these redshifts in our analysis here because the result of that analysis would be a test of the consistency of two empirical relations , not the validity of a particular empirical relation .",
    "similar tests can be applied to relations such as the @xmath0@xmath13 relation ( schaefer 2003 ; y04 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2005 , henceforth g05a ) , where @xmath13 is the peak bolometric luminosity and @xmath0 is the peak energy for either the peak of the lightcurve ( schaefer ) or the fluence spectrum ( y04 ; g05a ) .",
    "since both y04 and g05a used this relation to calculate redshifts for a sample of batse bursts , finding a physically reasonable redshift distribution , their relation implicitly passes the test .",
    "similar to np05 , we suspect that the amati relation , and to a lesser extent the ghirlanda relation , result from selection effects affecting the burst sample used to discover and calibrate this relation .",
    "the calibrating sample falls on the high fluence , low @xmath0 edge of the batse sample .",
    "while our results show that these relations are not valid for the entire batse sample , they do not preclude their validity for a sub - population , although for the amati relation this sub - population is small .",
    "in the next section (  2 ) we present the methodology behind our tests . the following section (  3 ) describes our data .",
    "we then discuss the results (  4 ) and present our conclusions (  5 ) .",
    "the amati relation is @xmath14 where @xmath0 is the peak energy for the ` fluence spectrum ' ( the spectrum averaged over the entire burst ) in the burst frame and @xmath1 is the isotropic energy , the burst energy if the observed flux were emitted in all directions ( a02 ) .",
    "fb05 find @xmath15  kev and @xmath16 ; we use @xmath17  kev and @xmath18 for our calculations .",
    "the ghirlanda relation is @xmath19 where @xmath2 is the total energy actually radiated ( g04 ) .",
    "fb05 find @xmath20  kev and @xmath21 ; we use @xmath22  kev and @xmath23 .",
    "the peak energy in the observer s frame is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the burst s redshift .",
    "the total energy radiated is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the jet opening angle and @xmath3 is the beaming fraction , which is determined observationally from modelling the evolution of the afterglow .",
    "the isotropic energy is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bolometric fluence and @xmath30 is the luminosity distance .",
    "consequently , the amati relation implies @xmath31(1+z)^3 } } = a_1(z )     \\quad , \\ ] ] and the ghirlanda relation implies @xmath32(1+z)^{2.429 } } }     = f_b a_2(z )     \\quad.\\ ] ] since @xmath33 ranges between 0 and 1 , @xmath34 is the upper limit to the @xmath35 ratio .",
    "we use @xmath36 and @xmath35 as the observed ratios and @xmath37 and @xmath34 as theoretical functions of @xmath25 .",
    "assuming @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40  mpc / km / s , figure  1 shows @xmath37 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath34 ( solid curve ) , respectively . as np05 pointed out , observed values of @xmath36 that exceed the maximum value of @xmath41 can not satisfy the amati relation ( note that np05 scaled @xmath36 by @xmath42 ) .",
    "similarly , observed values of @xmath35 that exceed the maximum value of @xmath43 can not satisfy the ghirlanda relation .",
    "since @xmath37 and @xmath34 are both 0 at @xmath44 , both ratios do not have useful lower bounds .",
    "note that in reality the two relations may have a dispersion that may not result from errors in the measured energies , and the maximum values of the ratios may be slightly greater , as discussed below .",
    "note that if @xmath36 does not exceed the maximum value of @xmath37 then eq .",
    "1 can be solved for @xmath25 . in general ,",
    "if an empirical relation between burst characteristics ( e.g. , the amati , ghirlanda or yonetoku relations ) results in a physically reasonable redshift distribution when the relation is applied to a burst dataset without measured redshifts ( e.g. , the dataset we use ) , then that relation implicitly passes the type of test used in this paper .",
    "these tests are rigorous but understate any inconsistency between the data and the proposed relations . @xmath37 and @xmath34 peak at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , both redshift values greater than the redshifts where",
    "most bursts are currently found to originate .",
    "in addition , the jet opening angle is generally small such that @xmath47 .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath37 and @xmath34 provide absolute tests of whether observed values of @xmath36 and @xmath35 can possibly satisfy the amati and ghirlanda relations , respectively .",
    "however , we construct model - dependent tests that compare the observed distributions of @xmath36 and @xmath35 with distributions resulting from convolving @xmath37 and @xmath34 with models of the burst redshift and beaming fraction distributions .    thus , if @xmath48 is the redshift probability distribution then @xmath49 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the heaviside function , 1 for @xmath51 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the burst rate is assumed to follow the star formation rate , and we use @xmath52 based on the star formation rate in rowan - robinson ( 2001 ) ; we found the same qualitative results using the star formation rates parameterized in guetta , piran & waxman ( 2004 ) based on the rates of rowan - robinson ( 1999 ) and porciani & madau ( 1999 ) .",
    "our conclusions are the same for the burst rate found by schaefer , deng , & band ( 2001 ) , which keeps rising as the redshift increases ; watanabe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) finds that the gamma - ray background can be explained if star formation follows this rate .",
    "next , if @xmath53 is the probability distribution for @xmath3 then @xmath54 \\quad.\\ ] ] note that we assume that the beaming fraction does not evolve with redshift . as we discuss below , the results are sensitive to @xmath53 .",
    "we use a sample of 760 batse bursts for which we have both spectral fits to their ` fluence spectra ' and energy fluences .",
    "the 16 channel cont spectra of bursts between april 1991 and august 1996 ( the 4th batse catalog  paciesas et al .",
    "1999 ) with sufficient fluxes were fit with a number of different spectral models ( mallozzi et al .",
    "1998 ) ; we use the @xmath10 from the fits with the ` band ' function ( band et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the fluences are from the 4th batse catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "the catalog presents 202000  kev fluences , which we treat as bolometric .",
    "bloom , frail & sari ( 2001 ) showed that the k - correction for burst spectra is of order unity , and fb05 use a k - correction to shift the fluence s energy band to 202000  kev in the burst frame ( which requires the burst redshift ) .",
    "jimenez , band & piran ( 2001 ) showed that the fluences resulting from fitting high resolution spectra and from the processing pipeline used to create the batse catalog can differ by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "this provides a measure of the uncertainty in the fluence and indicates that attempts to extend the energy band of the fluence using the spectral fits is unnecessary .",
    "figure  1 shows that the maximum value of the ratio @xmath55 occurs at @xmath56 . for our batse burst database ,",
    "668 out of 760 bursts , or 88% of the bursts , exceed this maximum . even if we increase this maximum value by a factor of 2 ( 5 ) to account for a real dispersion around the amati relation and uncertainties in the determination of @xmath10 and @xmath29 , 555 ( 391 ) out of 760 bursts , or 73% ( 51% ) of the bursts , exceed this increased maximum . by this rigorous test",
    "most of our bursts are inconsistent with the amati relation .",
    "ghirlanda , ghisellini & firmani ( 2005 , henceforth g05b ) quantify the deviation from the amati relation of the bursts in an edited version of our database in terms of the dispersion around the amati relation of the calibrating bursts ( i.e. , bursts with spectroscopic redshifts ) .",
    "g05b claim that there is no inconsistency with the amati relation , yet nakar & piran ( 2005 , private communication ) point out that the probability of finding the number of bursts whose ratio @xmath36 exceeds the limiting value by a given factor is negligible .    on the other hand ,",
    "figure  1 also shows that the maximum value of the function @xmath57 occurs at @xmath58 .",
    "assuming @xmath4 , only 12 out of 760 bursts , or 1.6% of the bursts , violate the ghirlanda relation . if the ratio s maximum value is doubled ( or even increased five - fold ) to account for a real dispersion around the relation and uncertainties in the observations , then only 6 out of 760 bursts , or 0.8% of the bursts violate this increased maximum .",
    "comparisons of the model and observed distributions of the energy ratio @xmath36 for the amati relation ( figure  2 ) shows that the observed distribution is shifted to larger values by an order of magnitude .",
    "this reinforces our conclusion above that our data and the amati relation are inconsistent .",
    "the analysis of the ghirlanda relation requires not only the redshift distribution but also the beaming fraction distribution ; as shown by figure  3 , we find that the model distribution for the ratio @xmath35 is heavily dependent on the assumed beaming fraction distribution .",
    "very small beaming factors result in afterglows with very early breaks in the afterglow evolution , before observations have begun , while large beaming factors lead to afterglows that break late , after the afterglow is no longer observable .",
    "consequently the currently observed distribution of beaming factors is plagued by selection effects at both its low and high ends ; these selection effects are not relevant to the batse database but they are largely the same effects that shaped the datasets in which the two relations were discovered .",
    "nonetheless , figure  3 compares the observed distribution ( solid curve ) to the model distribution resulting from three different estimates of the beaming fraction distribution ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the first uses the _ observed _",
    "@xmath3 distribution found by frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : @xmath59 for @xmath60 and constant for smaller @xmath3 .",
    "the second beaming fraction distribution is based on guetta et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who modelled the actual @xmath27 distribution as a steep power law above @xmath61 radians , and a much shallower power law for smaller @xmath27 . transforming @xmath27 into @xmath3 using the small angle approximation @xmath62 , and converting the actual distribution into the observed distribution ( a burst with a beaming factor of @xmath3 has a probability of @xmath3 of being observed ) results in @xmath63 for @xmath64 and constant for smaller @xmath3 .",
    "note that guetta et al .",
    "perform a more sophisticated conversion ( relying on additional modelling assumptions ) from the actual to observed distributions taking into account the burst luminosity function and the distance to which bursts can be detected .",
    "the differences between these two beaming faction distributions led us to fit the values of @xmath27 in fb05 , resulting in the third distribution on figure  3 : @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for smaller @xmath3 . for comparison",
    ", the dot - dashed curves result from constant values of @xmath68 and @xmath4 .",
    "although @xmath68 maximizes the kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) probability that the model and observed distributions are drawn from the same population , this probability is still only @xmath69 .",
    "the first three model distributions shown on figure  3 result from beaming factor distributions with similar power law indices for large beaming fractions but break values that differ significantly .",
    "power law distributions with indices @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 ) diverge as @xmath3 approaches 0 , and the value of the normalized probability at a given value of @xmath3 above any break or cutoff depends on the value of this break or cutoff .",
    "the magnitude of the discrepancy between the observed and model distributions of @xmath35 differ for the three estimates of the beaming fraction distribution , but in all cases there is a real discrepancy .",
    "perhaps the batse bursts consist of a number of different burst populations , only one of which satisfies the amati or ghirlanda relations . to test this hypothesis for each relation",
    ", we progressively removed the highest ratio from the observed distribution and calculated the k - s probability that the resulting observed and model distributions are the same .",
    "thus for the amati relation we first calculated the k - s probability that the observed distribution of the ratio @xmath72 ( the solid curve in figure  2 ) was drawn from a model distribution ( the dashed curves in figure  2 ) .",
    "we then sorted the observed ratio distribution .",
    "iteratively , we removed the highest ratio , and calculated the k - s probability .",
    "we performed the same procedure for the ghirlanda ratio @xmath35 for the three estimates of the beaming fraction distribution .",
    "table  1 shows the k - s probabilities for the total burst population and the sub - population that maximizes the k - s probability ; the table also shows the fraction that this sub - population constitutes .",
    "the small k - s probabilities for the full sample for each relation quantifies the discrepancies between the observed and model distributions , which are readily apparent from figures  2 and  3 .",
    "no more than @xmath5% of the burst sample is from a sub - population satisfying the amati relation .",
    "whether a sub - population can satisfy the ghirlanda relation depends on the beaming factor distribution ; a larger break in the beaming factor distribution increases both the size of the sub - population that may be consistent with the ghirlanda relation and the k - s probability of this sub - population .",
    "the redshift distribution used above assumes that batse detected bursts with equal efficiency at all redshifts . however , identical bursts originating at higher redshift will be fainter and their observed spectra will be softer than their low-@xmath25 counterparts . assuming there is no compensating evolution , the detection efficiency for higher redshift bursts should be smaller , and the observed redshift distribution should be shifted to smaller redshifts . indeed , this appears to be the case for a sample of bursts observed by batse that were binned with respect to intensity ( mallozzi et al .",
    "there is a strong general trend toward smaller average @xmath0 for the weaker bursts , and the interpretation is consistent with a larger average cosmological redshift . the model redshift distribution assuming redshift - independent detection efficiency peaks at @xmath73 , which is below the redshifts where the amati and ghirlanda ratios peak ( the ratios shown in figure  1 ) .",
    "thus shifting the observed redshift distribution to lower @xmath25 can only shift the model ratio distributions ( the dashed curves in figures  2 and  3 ) to lower values , increasing the discrepancy between the model and observed distributions .",
    "we test whether the amati relation ( a02)@xmath74and the ghirlanda relation ( g04)@xmath75are consistent with a large sample of batse bursts for which @xmath10 and fluences are available . note that @xmath0 is in the burst frame and @xmath10 in the earth s frame . in the most rigorous test , where the bursts may be at any redshift and have any beaming fraction for which these relations are satisfied",
    ", we find that the amati relation can not be satisfied by 88% of the bursts , consistent with the results of np05 , while the ghirlanda relation is not satisfied by only 1.6% of the bursts . accounting for a real dispersion on these relations does not alter this conclusion .    a less rigorous test results from modelling the redshift distribution for both relations and the beaming fraction @xmath3 distributions for the ghirlanda relation .",
    "the model distributions of the ratios @xmath76 for the amati relation and @xmath77 for the ghirlanda relation are shifted to smaller values of these ratios relative to the observed distribution .",
    "the magnitude of the discrepancy for the ghirlanda relation depends on the model for the beaming factor distribution , specifically on breaks or cutoffs in the assumed power law model at small values of @xmath3 .",
    "we use three different model distributions based on the small number of @xmath3 values , although we note that the set of bursts with @xmath3 is the same set used to discover and calibrate the two relations , and thus are affected by the same selection effects , which are not relevant to the batse bursts .",
    "including a detection efficiency that decreases as the redshift increases exacerbates this discrepancy ( unless there is compensating burst evolution ) .",
    "if we assume that the amati or ghirlanda relations apply to a sub - population of the entire dataset , then only @xmath5% of the batse burst sample can be members of this sub - population for the amati relation , whereas the sub - population s size depends on the beaming factor distributions for the ghirlanda relation .",
    "the methodology developed here can also be applied to the @xmath78 relation ( schaefer 2003 ; y04 ; g05a ) , where @xmath13 is the bolometric peak luminosity .",
    "schaefer finds that @xmath79 when he uses @xmath0 at the time of the peak flux ; he does not normalize the relation .",
    "y04 find @xmath80 and normalize the relation ; g05a find similar values .",
    "both y04 and g05a use @xmath0 for the fluence spectrum ; it is peculiar that quantities for the maximum flux and the entire burst should be so closely correlated .",
    "the relevant ratio is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the peak photon flux and @xmath83 is a characteristic energy ( see band et al .",
    "this ratio has a peak value at @xmath84 for schaefer s value of @xmath85 , and rises monotonically for @xmath86 found by y04 .",
    "there is no need to test this ratio for the y04 relation since both y04 and g05a use this relation to calculate reasonable redshifts for batse bursts .",
    "these results suggest that these two relations may be artifacts of selection effects in the burst sample in which these relations were discovered .",
    "the selection effects may favor a burst sub - population for which the amati or ghirlanda relation is valid .",
    "bursts for which redshifts and beaming fractions have been determined must be relatively bright and soft ( low @xmath10 , the energy range in which the localizing instruments operate ) to be localized and for their afterglows to be tracked .",
    "figure  4 shows the distribution of our batse burst sample in the @xmath10fluence plane and the bursts from the fb05 sample ; also seen are the limits resulting from the amati ( solid curve ) and ghirlanda ( assuming @xmath4 ; dashed curve ) relations .",
    "we converted the fluences of the fb05 sample to the 20 to 2000  kev band using the spectral fits in their paper ; where they do not report spectral indices we used low and high energy spectral indices of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively ( preece et al . 2000 ) .",
    "note that although the batse and fb05 fluences are chosen to be bolometric , in reality they integrate the spectrum between different energy limits , and they result from different types of processing . as can be seen , the bursts used to calibrate these two relations ( i.e. , the fb05 sample ) are on the edge of the batse distribution , consistent with the amati relation .",
    "as np05 concluded , the sample of bursts with redshifts and afterglow observations have a much higher selection threshold than the batse distribution .",
    "the much larger sample of bursts with redshifts , fluences and beaming fractions that swift will collect will test these relations conclusively , may distinguish between different burst populations and may reveal truly universal relations among burst properties .",
