    "many extensions of the standard model predict the existence of leptoquarks , which are color triplet particles carrying simultaneously leptonic and baryonic number and can have spin @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , some composite models postulate a preonic sub - structure where quarks and leptons have some common constituents @xcite .",
    "these models exhibit a very rich spectrum which includes excited states of the known particles , as well as new particles possessing unusual quantum numbers , such as leptoquarks and dileptons .",
    "leptoquarks are also present in extensions of the standard model that treat quarks and leptons in the same basis and , consequently , allow the existence of new particles mediating quark - lepton transitions .",
    "this class of models includes grand unified theories @xcite , technicolor models @xcite , and superstring - inspired models @xcite .",
    "the production and signals of scalar leptoquarks have already been analyzed in the literature for @xmath4 @xcite , hadronic @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , and @xmath6 @xcite colliders .",
    "however , previous studies of vector leptoquarks ( @xmath7 ) considered only @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath4 colliders @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study the capability of hadron colliders to unravel the existence of vector leptoquarks .",
    "we analyze their pair production via gluon  gluon and quark  antiquark fusion ( @xmath8 ) , single production in association with a lepton ( @xmath9 ) , and their effects in the production of lepton pairs ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "our results show that a machine like the lhc can expand considerably the range of leptoquark masses and couplings that can be explored .",
    "it is interesting to notice that pair production of vector leptoquarks is essentially model independent since it is related to the strong interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "single production and indirect effects are to a great extent model dependent because they are due to unknown interactions .",
    "moreover , these three signals for vector leptoquarks are complementary since they allow us not only to reveal their existence but also to determine their properties such as mass , spin , and couplings to quarks and leptons .",
    "there have been several direct searches for leptoquarks in accelerators .",
    "analyzing the decay of the @xmath11 into a pair of on - shell leptoquarks , the lep experiments established a lower bound @xmath12 gev for scalar leptoquarks @xcite , and a similar bound should hold for vector ones .",
    "this limit can be improved by looking for @xmath11 decays into an on - shell and an off - shell leptoquarks , resulting in @xmath13 gev @xcite .",
    "the search for scalar leptoquarks decaying into an electron - jet pair in @xmath14 colliders constrained their masses to be @xmath15 gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the experiments at hera @xcite placed limits on their masses and couplings , leading to @xmath16 gev depending on the leptoquark type and couplings .",
    "leptoquarks are also tightly constrained by low energy experiments @xcite , such as the proton lifetime measurements and the study of rare decays associated to flavor changing neutral currents . in order to avoid the strong low energy bounds we assumed that the leptoquark interactions conserve lepton and baryon number in addition to electric charge and color , and that their couplings are chiral @xcite .",
    "furthermore , leptoquarks that couple to more then one fermion generation are constrained to be very heavy , therefore , we shall study vector leptoquarks that couple only to one family .    for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we shall consider the vector leptoquarks inspired by the abbott ",
    "farhi model @xcite , which is a confining version of the standard model and is described by a lagrangian which has the same general structure of the standard model one .",
    "nevertheless , the choice of parameters is such that no spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs and the @xmath17 gauge interaction is confining . in this model",
    ", the physical left - handed fermions are bound states of a preonic scalar and a preonic left - handed fermion , while the vector bosons are p  wave bound states of the scalar preons .",
    "the vector leptoquarks predicted by this model are color triplets with electric charge @xmath18 and weak isospin @xmath2 .",
    "this model can not be analyzed perturbatively since it is strongly interacting in the energy scale of interest .",
    "therefore , we shall parametrize the interaction between vector leptoquarks ( @xmath19 ) and physical left - handed fermions by an effective lagrangian @xcite given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 are physical left - handed doublets , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is a flavor index , @xmath24 is the weak mixing angle , and the parameter @xmath25 is a measure of the strength of this interaction compared to the @xmath26 vertex .",
    "the above lagrangian is a prototype of a wide class of models @xcite presenting the interaction of color triplet , charged vectors with @xmath27 and @xmath28 numbers . according to ( [ lint ] ) , vector leptoquarks couple to both upper or lower components of the lepton and quark doublets with the same strength .",
    "we can estimate the size of the coupling @xmath25 imposing that unitarity is respected at tree level @xcite . for instance , the process @xmath29 violates unitarity at high energies for arbitrary values of the couplings .",
    "however , this can be avoided by choosing @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "since the vector leptoquarks are color triplets , it is natural to assume that they interact with gluons . to obtain their couplings to gluons we substituted @xmath31 by the covariant derivative @xmath32 in the vector leptoquark kinetic lagrangian and introduced an anomalous color magnetic moment @xmath33 . for @xmath34",
    ", unitarity is not respected at tree level by this model .",
    "therefore , we must either impose @xmath35 or introduce a new cutoff mass scale @xmath36 .",
    "we assumed that @xmath35 , since this leads to conservative estimates for the cross sections .",
    "the main decay modes of vector leptoquarks are into pairs @xmath37 and @xmath38 , thus , their signal is a charged lepton plus a jet , or a jet plus missing energy . using the couplings given above we obtain that the width of a vector leptoquark is @xmath39 where we neglected all fermion masses and summed over all possible decay channels .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following .",
    "section ii contains the study of the production of vector leptoquark pairs via quark  antiquark and gluon  gluon fusion , which leads to conservative estimates of the discover potential of vector leptoquarks in the next generation of hadronic colliders . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the single production of vector leptoquarks through quark ",
    "gluon fusion , exhibiting our results for first and second generation vector leptoquarks .",
    "the analysis of the indirect signals for leptoquarks is contained in sec .",
    "iv : one way to look for vector leptoquarks is through their effects on the production of lepton pairs at high energies , since they can be exchanged in the @xmath40-channel .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "pair production of new particles is , to a good approximation , a model independent process since it usually proceeds through well known strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "consequently , this process leads to more reliable estimates of the possibility of discovering new physics . in a hadronic collider",
    "there are two main mechanisms for the production of vector leptoquark pairs : gluon  gluon fusion ( @xmath41 ) and quark  antiquark fusion ( @xmath42 ) .    in lowest order , the feynman diagrams contributing to the production of vector leptoquark pairs via gluon ",
    "gluon fusion are the exchange of gluons in the @xmath43-channel , vector leptoquarks in the @xmath40- and @xmath44-channels , and a contact interaction ( @xmath45 ) , being its cross section for @xmath35 given by @xcite @xmath46 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the invariant mass of the subprocess , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the angle between the vector leptoquark and the incident gluon in the subprocess center of mass frame , and @xmath51 is the leptoquark velocity in this frame .",
    "this cross section has a good high energy behavior and , for large values of @xmath52 , it approaches a constant value proportional to @xmath53 due to the exchange of a vector particle in the @xmath40-channel .",
    "the quark ",
    "antiquark fusion production of vector leptoquark pairs takes place by the exchange of a gluon in the @xmath43-channel and a lepton in the @xmath40-channel .",
    "however , this last contribution is expected to be much smaller than the gluon exchange since the leptoquark couplings to quarks and leptons are expected to have a weak interaction strength  that is , it is natural to have @xmath25 of the order of the unit .",

    "figure [ vvpair ] exhibits our results for the total cross section for the production of vector leptoquark pairs as a function of its mass at the lhc ( taking @xmath61 tev ) , where we imposed a rapidity cut @xmath62 and used the set i of structure functions given in ref .",
    "@xcite evaluated at the scale @xmath63 . as expected , the gluon  gluon ",
    "fusion contribution dominates over the quark ",
    "fusion one at such high energies due to the large gluon - gluon luminosity .",
    "notice that the above results hold true for any kind of vector leptoquark since we used only their strong interaction properties in the calculations .",
    "the signal for leptoquark pair production is either @xmath64 ( @xmath65 jet ) , @xmath66 , or @xmath67 , where @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "certainly the last signal will be emersed in a qcd background and will be very hard to extract .",
    "the other two , mainly the first , have a very good chance to be observed since they have the striking feature of producing charged lepton ",
    "jet pairs with a given invariant mass , however , a careful studied of the qcd and electroweak backgrounds is needed to know whether this kind of events can be seen or not @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in order to have a rough estimate of the potential of the lhc to unravel the existence of vector leptoquarks via their pair production , we required the production of 100 of such pairs per year .",
    "taking into account the expected integrated luminosity for the lhc ( @xmath70 pb@xmath71/yr ) , we obtain that this machine will be able to discover first and second generation vector leptoquarks with masses up to @xmath72 tev .",
    "the production of a single leptoquark in a hadronic collider must be associated with a lepton due to lepton number conservation .",
    "the subprocess @xmath73 proceeds through the exchange of a leptoquark in the @xmath40-channel and a quark in the @xmath43-channel .",
    "this is a model dependent reaction since it involves unknown leptoquark ",
    "quark  lepton interactions . using the model described in the introduction , it is easy to obtain that the elementary cross section for this process is @xmath74 where @xmath75",
    ", @xmath50 is the angle between the vector leptoquark and the incident quark in the subprocess center of mass frame , and @xmath76 is the leptoquark velocity in this frame .    in order to obtain the total cross section for the inclusive process @xmath77 we must evaluate @xmath78 \\hat{\\sigma}_{\\text{single } } ( x_1x_2s ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the gluon structure function and @xmath58 is the density of down ( up ) quarks for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) assuming a first generation leptoquark . in the case of a second generation leptoquark , @xmath58 is the strange ( charm ) structure function for @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "figure [ vlpair ] summarize our results for the total cross section for the production of a vector leptoquark in association with charged leptons and neutrinos , where we imposed a rapidity cut on the charged particles @xmath83 and considered first and second generation vector leptoquarks . as expected , the cross section for producing pairs @xmath84 is approximately a factor of @xmath0 larger than the one for the production of @xmath85 since they are associated to the up and down structure functions respectively .",
    "since the strange content of the proton is larger than the charm one , the cross section for production of pairs @xmath86 is larger than the one for pairs @xmath87 .    taking into account that the decay of the leptoquark can give rise to a pair electron - jet or a jet plus missing energy , three different signals are possible for its single production : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , where @xmath91 or @xmath69 .",
    "this last signal has an incisive feature since it is a monojet event .",
    "however , it is going to be buried in the background produced by standard - model processes , like the production of @xmath92 associated with a jet , which are expected to have a much higher cross sections @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the other two possible signals are very striking since they exhibit pairs @xmath93 with ( approximately ) the same invariant mass . _ a priori _ , it is hard to estimate the background for these signals since it is due to the qcd production of heavy quarks , or @xmath94 and @xmath11 in association with jets , thus requiring further monte carlo work to determine their size @xcite .    in order to have an approximate idea of the potential of the lhc to discover vector leptoquarks via their single production",
    ", we required 100 events per year exhibiting a leptoquark decaying into a @xmath93 pair . using the expected luminosity for the lhc and that the branching ratio of vector leptoquarks to @xmath93 pairs is @xmath95 , we obtain that the lhc will able to probe first ( second ) generation vector leptoquark masses up to @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 , @xmath72 , and @xmath100 ) for couplings @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "the existence of leptoquarks can also be investigated through their effects as an intermediate state in the inclusive dilepton production ( @xmath104 ) , where they lead to a new @xmath40-channel contribution in addition to the usual exchange of @xmath105 and @xmath11 in the @xmath43-channel .",
