    "bilayer graphene  @xcite provides an attractive platform for unconventional two - dimensional electronic physics due to the two quadratic band contacts at its fermi points , and because of the variety of ways by which one can introduce a band gap and produce momentum - space berry curvature  @xcite .",
    "the interlayer nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath0 , warps the band structure of the individual graphene layers , repelling two bands away from the fermi energy and leaving the remaining two dispersing quadratically .",
    "this warping is a consequence of the two - step process in which electrons hop between the two low - energy sublattices via the two high - energy ones .",
    "the band touching points at inequivalent brillouin zone corners @xmath1 or @xmath2 are protected by the berry phase @xmath3 ( or winding number @xmath4 ) and the required chiral ( or sublattice ) symmetry between the low - energy sublattices on opposite layers  @xcite . keeping all of these symmetries ,",
    "the band touching point can only split , instead of being gapped out , even when trigonal warping and other weak remote - hopping processes are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "however , the chiral symmetry between the low - energy sublattices can be intrinsically broken by spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , spontaneously broken by electron - electron interactions  @xcite , or explicitly broken by an interlayer potential difference  @xcite . as a consequence , the quadratic band touching is no longer symmetry - protected and gaps open up at valleys @xmath1 and @xmath2 . while the first two types of gaps are small in practice  @xcite , the electric - field - induced gap , which is the focus of this paper , saturates at a large value comparable to the interlayer hopping @xmath5  ev  @xcite . opening the band gap produces large momentum - space berry curvature in the quasiparticle bands , with the curvature integral quantized to @xmath6 over a half brillouin zone centered at @xmath1 or @xmath2  @xcite . moreover , for bilayer graphene gapped by an electric field , the sign of this partial chern number depends on the valley index , the sign of the energy gap ( given by the direction of interlayer electric field ) , and the layer stacking order ( i.e. , ab or ba )  @xcite . here",
    "ab ( ba ) stacking refers to the case in which @xmath0 couples the top layer a ( b ) and bottom layer b ( a ) high - energy sublattices .    in the presence of an interlayer electric field , when the field direction is reversed across a line  @xcite or when the field is uniform and the layer stacking switches from ab to ba  @xcite , the valley - projected chern number changes by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) across the domain wall in valley @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . as a result",
    ", both types of domain walls host two chiral edge states in each valley with chirality ( direction ) locked to valley index @xmath1 or @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figwall ] .",
    "similar domain wall states also occur spontaneously due to interactions in the absence of electric fields but at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "importantly  @xcite , these `` quantum valley hall '' ( qvh ) edge states are not strictly topological and can be gapped out by a sufficiently strong , large - momentum scattering which couples the two valleys , even if the underlying symmetries are still preserved .",
    "it is therefore crucial that valley index also remains a `` good quantum number , '' for which we will assume that short - range disorder , interlayer stacking , and electric field direction changes are smooth on the scale of the lattice . under this assumption",
    ", backscattering is prohibited and the system of domain walls provides an attractive platform for tomonaga - luttinger liquid physics  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the electronic transport properties of a junction where two domain walls intersect ( fig .  [ figqpc ] ) .",
    "such a structure resembles the quantum point contact of the edges of two quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulators , which has been studied in refs .   and can be probed by four - terminal transport measurements .",
    "a domain wall junction can be tuned through a `` pinch - off transition '' by applying a local field ( such as a perpendicular electric field ) to the junction region . in ref .  , it was found that the corresponding pinch - off transition for qsh systems is controlled by a novel quantum critical point , and that at low temperatures the conductance is described by a universal scaling function across the pinch - off transition .",
    "in contrast to the qsh edge states , which have a single time - reversed pair of helical modes , the domain wall states in bilayer graphene host four helical pairs ( including electron spin ) . we find that this leads to several important modifications of the low - energy properties of the junction .",
    "unlike with the qsh edge states , whose forward - scattering interactions are characterized by a single luttinger parameter , it has been argued that for the domain wall states in bilayer graphene , one should characterize interactions with two independent luttinger parameters  @xcite .",
    "this leads to an expanded phase diagram for the possible stable states of the junction .",
    "moreover , we find that the pinch - off transition is modified .",
    "depending on the interaction strengths , there are two possible regimes for the reduced , two - terminal conductance : one in which it undergoes a single pinch - off transition directly from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and one in which it undergoes two separate transitions , separated by a stable state with conductance @xmath11 .",
    "we study the critical behavior of these transitions and compute the universal crossover scaling functions for weak interactions .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "first we introduce in detail the domain wall states in bilayer graphene and derive low - energy effective field theories for them .",
    "adding interactions , we show how these states are luttinger liquids described by two independent luttinger parameters .",
    "from there , we characterize the geometry of two intersecting domain wall states in the language of the resulting effective quantum point contact .",
    "we then analyze the resulting four - terminal junction in both the context of many - body tunneling in a bosonization framework and with an s - matrix renomalization group using diagrammatic perturbation theory . combining these analyses",
    ", we determine the behavior of the reduced , two - terminal conductance over a range of interaction strengths .      in this paper",
    ", we calculate several measurable properties of bilayer graphene domain wall quantum point contacts . in section  [ sec :",
    "domainwalls ] , we find the critical exponent @xmath12 which characterizes the low temperature tunneling conductance scaling for a single domain wall , a result previously derived in ref .  . in  [ sec : fourterminal ] , we introduce a diagonal conductance @xmath13 , which is only strictly quantized when valley index is conserved both within individual domain walls and across the junction .",
    "this conductance , therefore , stands as a first test of whether experimental samples are in the appropriate disorder regime for the analysis in this paper .",
    "we also show in  [ sec : fourterminal ] that states of exotic charge and valley tunneling character dominate the conductance of the junction under very strong attractive or repulsive interactions ( fig .",
    "[ figphase ] ) . finally , in  [ sec : scaling ] , we show that the left - to - right conductance @xmath14 undergoes either a direct transition from @xmath9 to @xmath10 or an indirect one with an intermediate step to @xmath11 depending on experimental specifics ( fig .",
    "[ figzerot ] ) .",
    "labeling the direct transition @xmath15 and the first step of the indirect transition @xmath16 , we go on to show that at low temperatures , the conductance transitions should collapse onto universal scaling functions @xmath17 with critical exponents @xmath18 as functions of the interaction strengths ( figs .  [ figtemp],[figscaling ] ) .",
    "in this section we introduce our model system of bilayer graphene domain wall modes .",
    "first , we begin with the hamiltonian for a single domain wall and the luttinger liquid physics which govern it in the presence of interactions .",
    "then , we discuss the four - terminal geometry which arises at the intersection of two domain walls and its equivalence to a quantum point contact .       is near the chiral symmetric point . adopting the notation of ref .  , the two domain wall states in each direction are labeled @xmath9 and @xmath19 working from the brillouin zone edge in . when the fermi energy is exactly in the middle of the bulk gap , the fermi velocities are the same for the @xmath9 and @xmath19 bands and electron direction is set by valley index @xmath1/@xmath2.,width=336 ]    as discussed in the introduction , bilayer graphene domain walls can be created by varying the direction of the interlayer electric field or by varying the interlayer stacking order . in either case , the valley - projected chern number changes by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) across the domain wall in valley @xmath1",
    "( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this necessitates the existence of two domain wall states in each valley , with the states at @xmath1 having equal and opposite velocities to those at @xmath1. adopting the notation of ref .  , we label these bands @xmath9 and @xmath19 respectively ( fig .",
    "[ figwall ] ) . for the purposes of our model",
    ", we will assume that the fermi energy lies exactly in the middle of the bulk gap , which allows the simplification @xmath20 .",
    "this allows us to write down the non - interacting hamiltonian density    @xmath21    where the indexes `` in '' and `` out '' refer to direction and can correspond to electron operators with valley index @xmath1 or @xmath2 depending on the orientation of the domain wall .",
    "we will see later that in a four - terminal structure , the correspondence between in / out and @xmath22 will alternate with lead index due to the valley - momentum locking of the domain wall modes .    in the limit of the fermi energy resting exactly at the chiral - symmetric point ,",
    "the band indexes become arbitrary labels for all of the calculations in this paper .",
    "a consequence of this is the emergence of a band - index - exchange symmetry in this problem , which we will frequently highlight in calculations throughout this paper .",
    "deviations from this point in the fermi energy are expected in physical systems , and will lead in general to a relaxation of this symmetry . if the deviations are small , the physics should resemble the predictions of this paper , with corrections of order @xmath23 .",
    "these corrections greatly complicate the calculations in this paper and obscure key generalities , and to that end we consider @xmath20 a desirable simplification of this problem .",
    "calculations by killi , wei , affleck , and paramekanti indicated that for interacting bilayer graphene systems , the interaction is dominated by two density - density interactions  @xcite :    @xmath24    @xmath25 is the usual two - body forward scattering term which leads to luttinger liquid physics and @xmath26 is a new one which breaks the u(2 ) symmetry of electron distribution between the @xmath9 and @xmath19 bands .",
    "both can be effectively tuned by altering the strength of the perpendicular electric field , though for all reasonable numerical estimates , ref .   found @xmath27 and @xmath28 harder to tune , which is sensible as only @xmath25 contains contributions from the long - range part of the coulomb interaction .",
    "other density - density interactions , specifically those which affect electron spin , should be small in practice . in the absence of an external magnetic field , and given the weak spin - orbit interaction in graphene , electron spin should remain su(2)-symmetric . in this limit , the electron spin sectors of this problem should remain noninteracting and terms which lead to phenomena such as spin - density waves will be marginally irrelevant  @xcite .    returning to our hamiltonian , we can consider a single domain wall by bosonizing ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; and @xmath33 is the short wavelength cutoff .",
