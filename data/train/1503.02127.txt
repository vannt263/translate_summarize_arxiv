    "quantum annealing ( qa ) is a metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization problems . in the words of physics ,",
    "the task is to find the ground state of the ising model with generally complicated interactions @xcite .",
    "qa uses quantum fluctuations realized by transverse fields to search for the solution in the phase space .",
    "a restricted version of qa is adiabatic quantum computation , in which the system is supposed to follow the instantaneous ground state of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "qa may be regarded as the quantum - mechanical alternative to simulated annealing ( sa ) @xcite , in which classical thermal fluctuations play the role of quantum fluctuations in qa .",
    "it is an interesting problem how qa can be better ( or worse ) than sa .",
    "recent years have observed high activities in this area , most of which indicate some kind of supremacy of qa over sa @xcite .",
    "experimental approaches have also become available using the d - wave machine @xcite-@xcite .",
    "experimental data suggest that quantum effects indeed play roles at least to some extent .    pioneering examples of numerical data , obtained from direct numerical integration of the schrdinger equation and quantum monte carlo simulations , are found in the thesis of kadowaki @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the probability of the system being in the true ground state is larger in qa than in sa for spin glass cases and travelling salesman problems .",
    "it has also been shown that the achieved values of the final energy are lower in qa than in sa .    from the analytical side ,",
    "theorems have been proven that give a sufficient condition for the time dependence of the strength of quantum fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. _ the annealing schedule , such that the system reaches the ground state in the infinite - time limit @xcite .",
    "the resulting condition turns out to give a faster reduction of the control parameter in qa than in sa .",
    "it should nevertheless be remembered that this result does not mean that a given difficult problem can be solved efficiently by the quantum method .",
    "theoretical supremacy of qa is usually quantitative , not qualitative , as far as the sufficient condition for the worst case is concerned .",
    "one of the interesting questions is whether or not qa can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer .",
    "the above - mentioned sufficient condition indicates that the amplitude of the transverse field should be reduced as a function of time in the same manner in the natural schrdinger dynamics and in the master equation dynamics corresponding to quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "this is a surprising result because the schrdinger dynamics is completely different from the classical stochastic dynamics of monte carlo processes .",
    "the result may be understood to suggest that qa can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer .",
    "we should , however , be very careful because , first , quantum monte carlo operates at low but finite temperatures whereas the schrdinger dynamics is a zero - temperature process .",
    "second , quantum monte carlo is a stochastic sampling of the classical master equation . directly solving",
    "the master equation consumes an exponential amount of time and memory on a classical computer , which is the same situation as in solving the schrdinger equation directly on a classical computer .    in the present paper ,",
    "we try to shed some light on this problem .",
    "following @xcite , we show that an ingenious mapping between classical stochastic dynamics and a quantum system allows us to derive a conclusion that simulated annealing may be efficiently simulated by quantum annealing but the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "let us first consider the classical dynamics of the ising model described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 stands for the set of @xmath2 ising spins , @xmath3 .",
    "we have added a subscript 0 to the hamiltonian to distinguish this classical ising hamiltonian from the quantum hamiltonian defined later .",
    "the master equation for the probability @xmath4 that the system is in the state @xmath1 @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes an element of the transition matrix , defines the classical stochastic dynamics .",
    "the transition probability is a function of the temperature , which is implicit in the above notation .",
    "the temperature is fixed for the moment .",
    "the transition matrix has non - positive right eigenvalues @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the leading eigenvector @xmath10 corresponds to the equilibrium state , and other eigenvectors represent relaxing modes .",
    "the solution to the master equation ( [ masterequation ] ) has a general expression as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the equilibrium gibbs - boltzmann distribution .",
    "this expression makes it clear that the relaxation time toward equilibrium is the inverse of the leading non - vanishing eigenvalue , @xmath13    the relaxation time diverges at a transition point @xmath14 .",
    "if the transition is of second order , the relaxation time at @xmath14 diverges polynomially as the system size @xmath2 increases , @xmath15 whereas the divergence is usually exponential at a first - order transition , @xmath16 this means that the energy gap between the leading eigenvalue @xmath8 and the next eigenvalue @xmath17 closes polynomially at a second - order transition point and exponentially at a first - order transition .",
    "if we define a @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 with element @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inverse temperature , then the detailed balance condition @xmath22 imposed on the transition matrix guarantees that @xmath19 is a symmetric matrix , @xmath23 since all matrix elements of @xmath19 are real , this is a hermitian matrix and thus can be regarded as the hamiltonian of a quantum system .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath19 shares the eigenstates and eigenvalues with @xmath24 , up to trivial factors , @xmath25 as can be verified from the definition ( [ wtoh ] ) . since the energy gap between the ground and first excited states @xmath26 is common to both systems ( the classical dynamical system and the quantum system ) , these two systems share the existence and properties of a phase transition . in particular",
    ", the energy gap of the quantum system closes polynomially as a function of the system size at a second - order quantum transition and exponentially at a first - order quantum transition if the same is true for the classical case .",
    "it is to be noticed that this classical - to - quantum mapping preserves the spatial dimension of the system .",
    "it is also important to remember that the definition ( [ wtoh ] ) leads to short - range interactions in @xmath19 if the same is true for @xmath27 as can be verified from the definition ( [ wtoh ] ) .",
    "a simple example is the one - dimensional ferromagnetic ising model @xmath28 from which the following quantum hamiltonian is derived under the heat - bath dynamics @xcite , @xmath29",
    "the converse mapping from a quantum hamiltonian to classical dynamics can be formulated as follows @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum spin system that can be expressed in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "it is necessary to impose the conditions of negative semi - definiteness of off - diagonal elements @xmath32 and positive semi - definiteness of the eigenvalues , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ground - state eigenvector",
    ". the latter condition can always be satisfied by a shift of the energy standard . under these conditions ,",
    "the matrix @xmath24 defined by @xmath35 can be regarded as the transition matrix of a classical stochastic process of the ising model @xmath0 whose elements are defined by @xmath36 this last definition is valid because the ground - state eigenvector @xmath34 has all its elements positive @xmath37 due to the perron - frobenius theorem that applies to matrices with the properties described in equation ( [ hoffdiagonal ] ) .",
    "notice that the prescription ( [ ptoh ] ) has been inspired by the relation @xmath38 in the classical - to - quantum mapping .",
    "it is also interesting that the present quantum - to - classical mapping does not change the spatial dimension in contrast to the suzuki - trotter decomposition or the path - integral formulation of quantum mechanics , by which the effective spatial dimension increases by one .",
    "the classical ising hamiltonian @xmath0 defined by equation ( [ ptoh ] ) has in general many - body long - range interactions with @xmath39 coefficients @xmath40 the reason is that equation ( [ ptoh ] ) must be satisfied by all possible values of @xmath41 , and there are @xmath39 of them .",
    "hence @xmath0 should have @xmath39 coefficients in front of various products of spin variables as they appear in equation ( [ qtoch0 ] ) .",
    "we set up @xmath39 linear equations for these coefficients , the solution of which gives , in general , non - vanishing values for all coefficients .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the classical - to - quantum mapping , in which short - range interactions are mapped to short - range interactions .",
    "since the many - body long - range interactions in equation ( [ qtoch0 ] ) are hard to simulate , we may conclude that classical simulation of the quantum system is not efficient .",
    "we have reformulated the mapping between classical stochastic dynamics of the ising model and a quantum system in stationary state .",
    "it has been shown that classical stochastic dynamics with fixed temperature can be efficiently simulated by a quantum system whereas quantum systems can not necessarily be efficiently simulated by classical dynamics as long as the present quantum - to - classical mapping is concerned .",
    "the present results indicate that simulated annealing , if the temperature is changed slowly , may be efficiently simulated by quantum annealing if a control parameter in the quantum system , typically the transverse field , is changed slowly or adiabatically . the converse process",
    "to simulate quantum annealing with a slow change of a control parameter by simulated annealing with a slow decrease of temperature is not necessarily efficient",
    ". it may be premature to conclude only from this result that quantum annealing is superior to simulated annealing because other formulations of classical - quantum correspondence may be possible in which the present conclusion does not hold .",
    "it is nevertheless important to have established that the present method yields asymmetric correspondence between classical stochastic dynamics and quantum mechanics .",
    "this was done in collaboration with junichi tsuda and sergey knysh .",
