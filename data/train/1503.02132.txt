    "we consider the ground state and dynamics of a dilute - gas bec of @xmath0 bosonic atoms trapped in an arbitrary external potential . in order to describe how interparticle correlations modify the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , we go to the next level of approximation , the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "the bogoliubov approximation  @xcite is important for several reasons : ( i )  it tells when the gross - pitaevskii ( mean - field ) approach begins to break down ; ( ii )  it describes small deviations from the gross - pitaevskii equation and can be used to study the stability of a bec ; ( iii )  it enables the calculation of how impurities change the behavior of a bec ; and ( iv )  it is useful for studying phase coherence between becs .",
    "conventionally , in the bogoliubov approximation , the condensate is treated as being close to a state in which all the bosons occupy a coherent state of a particular condensate mode ( i.e. , a particular single - particle state ) . when particle loss is negligible , however , the real condensate is much closer to a number state than to a coherent state ( see fig .  ) .    since a coherent state",
    "has a well - defined phase , the conventional bogoliubov approximation breaks the @xmath4 symmetry possessed by the condensate ; consequently , a fictitious goldstone mode  @xcite is present in the bogoliubov hamiltonian .",
    "because there is no restoring force on the goldstone mode , the bogoliubov ground state is not well defined ; worse , the goldstone mode causes the condensate state to deviate linearly in time from a single condensate in a coherent state ( i.e. , this is a secular deviation , not an oscillation ) .",
    "this problem is particularly pesky when the condensate is in a trapping potential , where the goldstone mode is a mixture of the condensate mode and modes orthogonal to it and thus can not be removed easily .",
    "the solution to getting rid of the unphysical goldstone mode is to adhere to the fact that the condensate has a fixed number of particles , i.e. , by using a bogoliubov approximation where particle number is conserved .",
    "many authors have considered the number - conserving bogoliubov approximation .",
    "girardeau and arnowitt  @xcite were the first to propose a theory for the ground state and excited states of many bosons based on a particle - number - conserving ( @xmath0-conserving ) formulation of the bogoliubov quasiparticles . c.  w. gardiner  @xcite introduced a somewhat similar approach to girardeau and arnowitt s , but with an emphasis on the time - dependent case ; c.  w. gardiner _",

    "@xcite then applied this approach to the kinetics of a bec in a trap .",
    "castin and dum  @xcite gave a modified form of the bogoliubov hamiltonian where the terms that break the @xmath4 symmetry are removed by a projection operator .",

    "an independent approach is founded on a number - conserving bcs - like _ ansatz _ introduced by leggett  @xcite .",

    "dziarmaga and sacha  @xcite generalized leggett s _ ansatz _ to the inhomogeneous case while retaining a similar pair - correlated form , @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the creation operator for the condensate mode and the creation operators @xmath11 and the real numbers @xmath12 are derived from the bogoliobov hamiltonian by using a singular - value decomposition .",
    "later , dziarmaga and sacha generalized their results to the time - dependent case  @xcite , where they showed that if the system starts in a bogoliubov vacuum state , it remains in a state of the same structure . the pair - correlated - state approach that dziarmaga and sacha introduced is closely related to the extended catalytic state approach discussed in the current paper . in  @xcite , we study pair - correlated states of the form  ( [ eq : pcs ] ) in great detail and demonstrate this equivalence for the case where the coefficients @xmath12 are considerably less than one  i.e . , the regime where there is a single dominant condensate wavefunction ; in addition , we derive analytical expressions for the physical quantities ( particularly the single- and two - particle reduced density matrices ) associated with pair - correlated states in the large-@xmath0 limit when @xmath13 , a regime where more than one mode can be macroscopically occupied .     and ( b )  a number state with particle number @xmath0 .",

    "we return to the number - conserving bogoliubov approximation in this paper and develop a particularly transparent method of deriving the relevant equations .",
    "our approach to a number - conserving bogoliubov approximation is to `` encode '' the many - body wavefunction of the bec in the @xmath0-particle sector of a state we call an _ extended catalytic state _ ( ecs ) , by which we mean a coherent state for the condensate mode and a state to be determined by the dynamics for the orthogonal modes of the atoms . using a time - dependent interaction picture",
    ", we move the coherent state to the vacuum , thus making all the field operators formally small compared to @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian can then be organized by powers of @xmath1 . requiring the terms of order @xmath2 to vanish in the interaction - picture evolution equation",
    "gives the gp equation for the condensate wavefunction .",

    "[ subsec : bog ] ) . the gp equation and the bogoliubov hamiltonian arise naturally as we organize the interaction picture hamiltonian by powers of @xmath1 .",
    "we make the bogoliubov hamiltonian number conserving by adding to it an auxiliary term that does not change the dynamics in the @xmath0-particle sector .",

    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes the results of the paper .",
    "this paper is based on z. jiang s phd dissertation ( chapter 3 ) at the university of new mexico  @xcite .",
    "quantum optics teaches that coherent states are easier to deal with than number states , and what is true there is true here as well .",
    "indeed , the usual mean - field approximation to bec evolution is based on the assumption that the bec is in a coherent state of a condensate mode  @xcite .",
    "a problem with this approach is that the number of particles in a bec is usually fixed , whereas coherent states are superpositions of states with different numbers of particles .",
    "a related problem is that assigning a coherent state to a bec breaks its phase symmetry , thus causing problems in developing the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "our philosophy for dealing with these problems in a bec that has a fixed particle number @xmath0 is to extend the bec state @xmath14 to a state @xmath15 , for which the condensate mode is in a coherent state , but the @xmath0-particle sector is the same as @xmath16 within a normalization constant .",
    "consider an arbitrary state @xmath16 with @xmath0 particles , for which we have the relative - state decomposition in the number basis of the condensate mode , @xmath17 where the kets labeled by 0 and @xmath18 apply to the condensate mode and to all the modes orthogonal to the condensate mode , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath19 is the particle - number operator for the orthogonal modes .",
    "the state @xmath20 for the orthogonal modes , which has @xmath21 particles in the orthogonal modes , is not necessarily normalized .",
    "the key to our approach is that the state  ( [ eq : psin ] ) can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the projection operator onto the @xmath0-particle sector and @xmath24 is an ( unnormalized ) state of the modes orthogonal to the condensate mode .",
    "we now introduce the _ extended catalytic state _ ,",
    "@xmath25 which is related to the physical state by @xmath26 the extended catalytic state is a direct product of a coherent state @xmath27 in the condensate mode and an unnormalized state @xmath28 of the orthogonal modes .",
    "notice that once @xmath29 is specified , the extended catalytic state has a one - to - one correspondence with the physical state .",
    "the structure of the extended catalytic state allows us to study the dynamics of a bec in the schrdinger picture , and we will see that the structure is preserved throughout the evolution in the bogliubov approximation .    for a pure condensate with no depletion of the condensate mode ,",
    "the modes orthogonal to the condensate mode are in vacuum , and the overall state has the form @xmath30 in this case we have @xmath31 generally one expects that a dilute - gas bec has a state close to that of a pure condensate , in which case the noncondensate state @xmath28 is close to the vacuum ; we want to develop an approximate description based on this expectation .",
    "to do so , notice that the encoding into an extended catalytic state works for any value of @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , one has the freedom to choose @xmath29 at will ; after the projection , all values of @xmath29 yield the same physical state .",
    "nonetheless , we stick to the choice @xmath32 , for the reason that we make approximations in deriving the dynamics of @xmath15 and the projection onto the @xmath0-particle sector can amplify the errors due to these approximations . to keep these errors under control",
    ", we center the number distribution of the coherent state at the actual atomic number @xmath0 .",
    "the phase of @xmath29 is yet another matter , which we discuss further below .",
    "the bec hamiltonian conserves particle number and thus commutes with the particle - number operator . as a consequence ,",
    "the evolution operator @xmath33 commutes with @xmath34 , allowing us to move the evolution operator through the projection onto the @xmath0-particle sector so that it acts directly on the extended catalytic state : @xmath35 to find @xmath36 , one solves for @xmath37 and then projects onto the @xmath0-particle sector .",
    "the first step in developing the boboliubov approximation is to go to an interaction picture in which the condensate mode is displaced from a coherent state to vacuum . to do this , we start with a condensate mode defined by a time - dependent single - particle state @xmath38 , which has wavefunction @xmath39 the schrdinger - picture field operator @xmath40 satisfies the commutation relation @xmath41=\\delta(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}')\\;.\\ ] ] the annihilation operator for the condensate mode is related to the schrdinger - picture field operator by @xmath42 here , in the final two equalities",
    ", we introduce a shorthand notation for the integral as bra - ket inner products between a single - particle state and the field operator .",
    "the creation operator for the condensate mode is @xmath43 here and throughout this section , complex conjugation in the single - particle hilbert space is defined relative to the position representation .",
    "the bra - ket notation introduced here , though _ ad hoc _ , is useful for manipulating the complicated expressions that arise as we proceed , more so once we get to the two - component case in sec .",
    "[ sec : twocomp ] . notice that the annihilation and creation operators have two different bra - ket forms ,",
    "both of which are used in our treatment .",
    "the field operator can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the field operator with the condensate mode excluded . in the schrdinger picture , @xmath40 is time independent , but the split between a condensate mode @xmath46 and orthogonal modes introduces time dependence because the condensate mode is changing in time ; hence , both @xmath47 and @xmath45 are explicitly time - dependent operators in the schrdinger picture . in terms of our shorthand notation , we can write @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the projector onto the single - particle space orthogonal to the condensate mode , with @xmath50 being the projector onto @xmath38 .",
    "notice that @xmath51 .",
    "the extended catalytic state for a pure condensate in the time - dependent condensate mode @xmath38 is @xmath52 where the displacement operator @xmath53 for the condensate mode , which we usually abbreviate as @xmath54 , is defined as @xmath55 the state  ( [ eq : ecs_td ] ) , which describes a pure condenstate with no depletion , is the one we perturb about in developing our approximate description .",
    "we can now introduce the desired interaction picture as the one where the condensate mode is displaced to vacuum ; i.e. , states transform to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the evolution operator in the interaction picture .",

    "the result is the particularly simple form  ( [ eq : urv ] ) for the schrdinger - picture evolution at bogoliubov order .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : twocomp ] we extend our approach to becs with two internal levels .",
    "this turns out to be largely a matter of using a spinor notation that puts the derivation into a form that mimics the single - component derivation of sec .",
    "[ sec : ecsbog ] . because of this formal similarity , generalization to multiple hyperfine levels would be straightforward . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : spinsqueeze ] we specialize the bogoliubov approximation to the two dominant modes , the condensate mode and the mode orthogonal to it in the same two - dimensional subspace of the internal levels .",
    "we discuss how to generalize beyond the bogoliubov approximation to the two - mode approximation for these two dominant modes , thus allowing a treatment of the spin squeezing of these two modes .",
    "the number - conserving bogoliubov hamiltonian we find is identical to the one derived originally by castin and dum  @xcite .",
    "the chief difference between our approach and that of castin and dum is that they worked in the heisenberg picture , whereas our derivation is carried out in the schrdinger picture and a closely allied interaction picture .",
    "there are several reasons for presenting a new framework for a derivation of the same result .",
    "the first is the modest one that the new derivation might highlight assumptions from a different perspective and ease the way forward on different , but related problems .",
    "indeed , in our approach , the bogoliubov excitations are easily seen as excitations on top of a pure condensate mode that evolves according to the gp equation .",
    "the method we use for handling the phase diffusion that arises from assigning a phase to the condensate mode comes directly from re - asserting the number conservation that applies to a lossless bec .",
    "a second reason is that working in the schrdinger picture allows us to separate cleanly , within the bogoliubov approximation , the evolution of the spatial mode structure from the evolution of the state of these modes .",
    "a central problem of dilute - gas bec theory and of many other problems in many - body physics is how to do this separation appropriately , and our analysis can be instructive in how to formulate this separation .",
    "a third reason is that the schrdinger picture allows us to identify the entanglement between the condensate mode and the orthogonal modes that are excited by the bogoliubov hamiltonian . in our approach , this entanglement arises when the extended catalytic state is projected into the @xmath0-particle sector to obtain the physical state of the bec .",
    "the entanglement is something that can be analyzed easily in our schrdinger - picture formulation , whereas even the proper formulation of entanglement is difficult in the heisenberg picture .",
