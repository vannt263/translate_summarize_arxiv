    "this review discusses the properties of the small fraction of central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspne ) which share a spectroscopic appearance with massive , carbon - sequence ( wc - type ) wolf - rayet stars .",
    "massive wc stars are the chemically evolved descendents of initially very massive o stars ( @xmath2 ) exhibiting the c and o products of core helium burning , plus a unique emission line spectral appearance due to fast , dense stellar wind outflows .",
    "such stars are young , with ages of only a few myr of which several hundred cases are known within the milky way , supplemented by thousands more known in external star - forming galaxies ( crowther 2007 ; hamann these proc . ) .",
    "cspne possessing a similar spectral morphology to wc stars are denoted [ wc ] and are at a post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase in the late stages of evolution of low or intermediate mass stars ( @xmath3 ? ) with only a few dozen examples known in the milky way plus a handful in the magellanic clouds . with respect to normal h - rich cspne , the unusual surface chemical composition of [ wc ] stars apparently results from a late thermal pulse ( ltp ) , causing a h - deficient surface , and likely connection with other h - deficient stars , most notably pg1159 stars ( werner et al .",

    "an oxygen - rich ( wo ) subclass was introduced by barlow & hummer ( 1982 ) .",
    "the most recent unified scheme spans wc4 to wc11 , and wo1 to wo4 , based upon the relative strengths of ciii - iv and ov - vi and civ , respectively ( crowther , de marco , & barlow 1998 ) .",
    "it is well known that the subtype distribution of massive wc and wo stars differs from cspne , in the sense that the milky way is dominated by intermediate wc7@xmath42 subtypes , while cspne peak at high and low ionization , i.e. [ wo ] and wc910 .",
    "in addition , wc subtype distributions depend upon their host galaxy metallicity , with wc4 subtypes dominant in the metal - poor lmc .",
    "these differences are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ wc_pop ] , drawn from crowther ( 2007 ) for massive wc stars , and the cspne catalogue , except for updates from crowther et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , acker & neiner ( 2003 ) .",
    "the latter classification scheme is specifically applied to just cspne , so caution has to be used when inter - comparing [ wc ] and and wc subtype distributions .",
    "galactic bulge [ wc]-type cspne have been omitted due to difficulties with obtaining robust spectral classifications , in the sense that high dust extinctions hinder observations in the blue for the diagnostic o  vi 3811 - 34 doublet .",
    "regardless of classification issues , it is apparent that some wc - type stars are morphologically identical to [ wc ] stars , e.g. the comparison between campbell s star bd+30@xmath5 3639 and hd  164270 by smith & aller ( 1971 ) . in general ,",
    "[ wc ] stars possess lower wind velocities , although this is not a defining characteristic . indeed ,",
    "the only defining characteristic amongst milky way stars is the presence of a bright nebula for [ wc ] stars .",
    "the [ wo ] sequence stars overlap with pg1159 stars ( smith & aller 1969 ) in the sense that the latter often shows weak ovi 3811 - 34 emission .",
    "intermediate [ wo]-pg1159 stars include ngc  2371 and abell 78 . beyond [ wc ] , [ wo ] and pg1159 stars",
    ", a number of emission line cspne have been grouped together as ` weak emission line stars ' ( wels ) , although this represents a heterogeneous group , often dictated to by the properties of the nebula .",
    "for example , a very strong nebular continuum might cause a genuine [ wo ] star to be mis - labelled as a weak emission line cspne .",
    "overall , care should be taken to distinguish between the various flavours of emission line cspne , since some more closely resemble of stars ( e.g. iras 21282 + 5050 , crowther et al .",
    "1998 ) than [ wc ] stars .",
    "our interpretation of hot , luminous stars via radiative transfer codes is hindered with respect to normal stars by several effects .",
    "first , the routine assumption of lte breaks down for high - temperature stars . in non - lte",
    ", the determination of populations uses rates which are functions of the radiation field , itself a function of the populations .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to solve for the radiation field and populations iteratively .",
    "second , the problem of accounting for the effect of millions of spectral lines upon the emergent atmospheric structure and emergent spectrum  known as line blanketing  remains challenging for stars in which spherical , rather than plane - parallel , geometry must be assumed due to stellar winds , since the scale height of their atmospheres is not negligible with respect to their stellar radii .",
    "the combination of non - lte , line blanketing ( and availability of atomic data thereof ) , and spherical geometry has prevented the routine analysis of such stars until recently .    specifically for wolf - rayet stars , radiative transfer is generally solved in the co - moving frame , using either the cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) and powr ( grfener , koesterke , & hamann 2002 ) codes . in general , the majority of published [ wc ] studies have employed earlier non - blanketed versions of these codes , applied to late - type [ wc ] stars ( leuenhagen , hamann , & jeffrey 1996 ; leuenhagen & hamann 1998 ; de marco & crowther 1998 ) and early - type [ wc ] and [ wo ] stars ( koesterke & hamann 1997ab ) .",
    "stellar temperatures for [ wc ] stars are difficult to characterize , because their geometric extension is comparable with their stellar radii .",
    "atmospheric models are typically parameterized by the radius of the inner boundary @xmath6 at high rosseland optical depth @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , only the optically thin part of the atmosphere is seen by the observer .",
    "the measurement of @xmath6 depends upon the assumption that the same velocity law holds for the visible ( optically thin ) and the invisible ( optically thick ) part of the atmosphere .",
    "the optical continuum radiation originates from a ` photosphere ' where @xmath8 .",
    "typical [ wc ] winds have reached a significant fraction of their terminal velocity before they become optically thin in the continuum .",
    "@xmath9 , the radius at @xmath10 lies at highly supersonic velocities , well beyond the hydrostatic domain . in some weak - lined",
    ", [ wo ] stars , this is not strictly true since their spherical extinction is modest , in which case r@xmath11 .",
    "the incorporation of line blanketing necessitates one of several approximations , for which a ` super - level ' approach is widely followed .",
    "derived stellar temperatures depend sensitively upon the detailed inclusion of line - blanketing by iron - peak elements . in general , care must be taken when comparing [ wc ] stars to other cspne on the usual ( @xmath12 ) diagrams ( e.g. werner & herwig 2006 ) .",
    "inferred bolometric corrections and stellar luminosities also depend upon detailed metal line - blanketing ( e.g. hillier & miller 1999 ) .    until recently , the number of [ wc ] stars studied with non - lte , clumped",
    ", metal line - blanketed models has been embarrassingly small , due to the need for detailed , tailored analysis of individual stars using a large number of free parameters .",
    "exceptions include todt , grfener , & hamann ( 2006 ) for [ wo ] stars and crowther et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , marcolino et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for [ wc ] stars .",

    "the majority of studies presented to date have focused upon optical spectral diagnostics , often supplemented by uv datasets .",
    "herald & bianchi ( 2004ab ) have undertaken solely uv studies of milky way and lmc cspne including ngc 2371 ( [ wo]-pg1159 ) and smp lmc 61 ( [ wc4 ] ) . in general",
    "we shall concentrate upon results from optical studies , since there may be potential systematic offsets from uv versus optical results ( as is true for massive o stars ) .",
    "according to results from leuenhagen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , leuenhagen & hamann ( 1998 ) plus koesterke & hamann ( 1997ab ) , using a single stellar atmospheric code , late - type [ wc8 - 10 ] stars possess uniformly lower wind velocities and stellar temperatures than early - type [ wc4 - 5 ] and [ wo ] stars , as is the case for massive wc stars . typically @xmath13 = 200  1000 kms@xmath14 for late - type [ wc ] stars , with @xmath15 = 30  80 kk versus @xmath13 = 1200  3500 kms@xmath14 and @xmath15 = 125  150 kk for early - type [ wc ] and [ wo ] stars .    regarding mass - loss rates , late - type [ wc ] stars span a wide range i.e. @xmath16yr@xmath14 , neglecting wind clumping , while early - type [ wc ] stars possess stronger winds than [ wo ] stars , with 10@xmath17 and @xmath18 yr@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we will show that this difference is central to early - type stars being of either one flavour or another .",
    "alternatively winds may be parameterized by a so - called transformed radius , @xmath19 .",
    "it is now well established that massive wr stars are structured , as evidenced from the weakness of electron scattering wings with respect to recombination lines ( hillier 1991 ) and time variable profiles ( lpine et al .",

    "marcolino et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also emphasised the difficulties in tightly constraining elemental abundances in [ wc ] stars .",
    "numerous oxygen diagnostics are available for [ wc ] and [ wo]-type cspne , although these are highly sensitive to the precise oxygen ionization balance , so one should treat published abundances , typically x(o)@xmath010% , as less reliable than helium or carbon . in [ wc ] stars , hydrogen has not been firmly established , although it can not be excluded in many cspne due to severe nebular contamination .",
    "there have been some claims for a non - zero hydrogen content , such as x(h)@xmath247% by mass in he  2113 ( [ wc10 ] ) according to leuenhagen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) although this was established to be of nebular origin by de marco , barlow , & storey ( 1997 ) .",
    "overall h , he , c and o abundances ( or limits ) are consistent with a ltp scenario . if nitrogen is detected , a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) would be preferred ( werner & herwig 2006 ) . due to the overwhelming carbon and oxygen emission line spectrum , the presence of nitrogen is however difficult to confirm .",
    "marcolino et al .",
    "suggest x(n)@xmath240.1% for all four [ wc ] stars , although todt et al .",
    "( 2006 ) propose x(n)@xmath01.5% for pb6 ( [ wo ] ) .",
