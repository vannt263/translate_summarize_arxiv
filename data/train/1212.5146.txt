    "in @xcite we investigated the time dependent schrdinger - newton equation ( henceforth abbreviated sn  equation ) : @xmath0 with a potential term that is the spatial convolution of the absolute - value squared of the wave function with the coulomb potential @xmath1 : @xmath2    our numerical and analytical consideration of the sn equation in @xcite showed that inhibitions of dispersion due to the gravitational self - interaction occur at mass values of about @xmath3u for a given wave packet width of @xmath4 .",
    "this result was contrary to a previous one by salzman and carlip @xcite , where inhibitions of dispersion were claimed to occur at mass values more than six orders of magnitude smaller , namely at @xmath5 . somewhat loosely , this behaviour of a wave packet initially shrinking in width was called a `` collapse '' by salzman and carlip and we adopt this nomenclature .",
    "as we pointed out in the summary of @xcite , more consideration has to be given to the question concerning the application of the sn equation to realistic systems , like molecules . in a recent paper @xcite jskelinen",
    "suggested that the gravitational self - interaction for a molecule should be modelled by the potential of a solid sphere of radius @xmath6 @xmath7 which has to be put into equation ( [ eq : schroedingernewton ] ) instead of the coulomb potential .",
    "jskelinen points out that in our case , for a wave packet width of @xmath4 , the results obtained for this potential deviate from the results for the coulomb potential for masses beyond @xmath8u .",
    "we will next briefly review the rationale behind such a modification and then turn to the quantitative changes it implies for our previous analysis  @xcite . for comparison we will also consider the case of a hollow sphere .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss how a one - particle sn equation for the centre of mass is obtained by separation from an @xmath9-particle sn equation , as claimed in  @xcite .",

    "@xcite the _ mutual _ gravitational interactions are said to be negligible compared to electromagnetic interactions and only the diagonal terms of @xmath20 are considered .",
    "but in situations where the width of the individual marginal distributions is large compared to the mutual distances of their centres these contributions are of the same order of magnitude as the diagonal terms .",
    "we emphasise that in this treatment there is a _",
    "twofold _ difference between the electromagnetic and the gravitational interaction of the particles .",
    "first , self - interactions of particles with their own _ electromagnetic _ field are not considered .",
    "second , whereas the electromagnetic interaction is local , the gravitational interaction is non - local in the sense explained above . and it is this non - locality that is responsible for a non - trivial contribution of the overall gravitational field to the dynamics of the centre of mass .",
    "we now introduce the centre of mass coordinates @xmath24 and make the separation ansatz @xmath25 , where the prefactor comes from the integral measure and allows us to normalise all wave functions to one .",
    "then @xmath26 only depends on the relative coordinates @xmath27 .",
    "substituting the separation ansatz into the expression ( [ eqn : ugrav ] ) , @xmath20 can be written as @xmath28 where we assumed @xmath9 to be a large number , such that all terms involving the @xmath9-th particle can be neglected .",

    "we can therefore substitute the inner integral with the gravitational potential of the @xmath37-th particle , which is @xmath38 we then obtain @xmath39 if now we assume that the extent of the molecule is much smaller than the width of the wave function , such that the wave function does not change much over a distance @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 , we can neglect the shift by @xmath27 . the sum over all @xmath13",

    "+     +    we study the evolution of the spherically symmetric sn equation making use of the same numerical methods used in @xcite , simply replacing the potential by the solid - sphere potential ( [ eqn : solid - sphere potential ] ) .",
    "all results refer to an initial gaussian wave packet @xmath47 with a width of @xmath48 .",
    "first we look at the evolution of wave packets if the density of the solid sphere corresponds to the density of either lithium ( 534kg@xmath49 ) or osmium ( 22610kg@xmath49 ) , cf .",
    "@xcite . to illustrate the results ,",
    "the radius within which 90% of the probability density are contained is plotted against time in figure [ fig : plot_r90 ] for several masses .",
    "in addition to the results for the density of lithium ( li ) and osmium ( os ) the results for the sn equation with coulomb potential obtained in @xcite are also plotted",
    ".    for all masses considered the modified potential results in an even faster collapsing wave packet .",
    "the shrinking behaviour also sets in for smaller masses , namely for @xmath50u the modified solution shrinks while the sn equation solution is still spreading for this mass .    to get a better impression of this behaviour ,",
    "let us take a look at the effect that the radius of the solid - sphere potential has on the mass for which the collapsing behaviour of the wave packet sets in .",
    "we thus ask the following question : given a sphere of radius @xmath6 , what mass @xmath51 do we have to distribute homogeneously `` within '' this sphere . ] for a collapse of the wave packet to take place ?    in @xcite we found that for a @xmath52 wave packet a collapse is observed for masses of about @xmath3u and higher . in figure",
    "[ fig : plot_m_r ] this critical mass value is plotted depending on the radius of the solid sphere .    for small radii of several nanometers",
    "this critical mass reduces to about two - thirds of the value obtained in @xcite and it stays smaller than this value until the size of the solid sphere exceeds the width of the wave packet significantly . only holds for small radii compared to the extent of the wave packet , the results for larger radii have to be regarded with some scepticism , anyway .",
    "] there seems to be an extremal value somewhere in between 20 and 100 nm .",
    "for which the total energy is zero . ]",
    "the behaviour described in the previous paragraph seems peculiar , as naively one would expect the gravitational field to be the weaker , and therefore the collapse mass to be the higher , the larger the solid - sphere radius gets .",
    "but the ascertained radius - dependence of the collapse mass becomes more comprehensible by an analysis of the total energy value of the sn equation .",
    "we performed a similar analysis in section 3.2 of @xcite where we indicated the total energy for the sn wave packet : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that for the sn equation a collapse can only be observed if the total energy is positive .",
    "the second time derivative of the second moment @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 for an arbitrary potential @xmath58 .",
    "if the potential fulfils a poisson equation @xmath59 it takes the form @xmath60 which is strictly positive for positive energy .",
    "although this relation does not hold for the modified potentials , the mass value for which the total energy equals zero might nevertheless provide an insight of the qualitative behaviour of the equation .",
    "we thus plot this mass value @xmath61 against the radius @xmath6 of the solid - sphere in figure [ fig : m0 von r ] .",
    "as one can see , this mass value indeed decreases significantly within the width of the wave packet and starts to increase only when the radius of the solid sphere exceeds this width .",
    "thus , qualitatively the behaviour of the zero - total - energy mass - value coincides with the behaviour of the collapse mass .      at least for the experimental situation of interferometry with fullerene molecules",
    ", it seems a more realistic model to consider a hollow - sphere potential @xmath62 instead of the solid - sphere potential  ( [ eqn : solid - sphere potential ] ) .",
    "let us therefore repeat the analysis from section  [ sec : solid - sphere ] for the potential  ( [ eqn : hollow - sphere potential ] ) .",
    "the result is plotted in figure  [ fig : plot_m_r_hohl ] .",
    "as one can see , the collapse mass does not decrease but remains almost constant as long as the radius of the hollow sphere does not exceed the wave packet width . for larger",
    "radii the collapse mass increases fast .     for the coulomb potential ( dashed straight line ) , the solid sphere ( dotted line ) and the hollow sphere ( solid line ) . ]",
    "this can also be understood if , again , we look at the total energy ( see figure [ fig : m0 von r 2 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the solid sphere , @xmath61 for the hollow sphere converges against the sn value for @xmath63 and compared to the solid - sphere value ( dotted line ) it only decreases very weakly before increasing for radius values above the width of the wave packet .",
    "if one does not take the simpler point of view we took in @xcite and models large molecules by a point - particle sn equation , and instead assumes the modified equation given in @xcite to provide a more realistic description for such molecules , our results confirm that there are indeed deviations between both equations , as jskelinen suggested .",
    "however , whereas one naively might expect that a smaller matter density leads to a weaker gravitational interaction and therefore to a behaviour that is closer to the free schrdinger equation , our results show that the converse is true .",
    "as long as the radius of the solid - sphere potential does not significantly exceed the extent of the wave packet , the effect of inhibitions of dispersion is even increased compared to the sn equation .",
    "the analysis of the total energy given in section [ sec : total energy ] provides an insight why this somewhat peculiar behaviour shows up .",
    "such an increase of the effect can not be observed for the hollow - sphere potential , but there is also no significant decrease , as long as the radius of the hollow sphere does not exceed the extent of the wave packet .",
    "the question why there should be a self - gravitational interaction while there is no electromagnetic self - interaction term present in the schrdinger equation remains an issue that should be addressed ( cf .",
    "the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this issue arises even more distinctly in the analysis given in section [ sec : separation ] of this paper , where the gravitational interactions are treated differently to the electromagnetic ones .",
    "we conclude that taking into account the finite extent of the source in the way suggested in  @xcite does not lead to an attenuation of the effect of inhibitions of dispersion as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the prospects for an experimental verification of self - gravitation of quantum systems in future molecular interferometry experiments remain unchanged .",
