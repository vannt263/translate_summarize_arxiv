    "jets and molecular outflows are ubiquitous among young stellar objects ( ysos , see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the velocity of the outflow ranges from a few hundred km s@xmath2 for the axial high - velocity component ( hvc ) that propagate to large distances , to about @xmath6 km s@xmath2 for the so - called low - velocity component ( lvc ) that is more extended @xcite .",
    "the outflow is strongly collimated at large distance ( @xmath7 au scale ) , with typical opening angle of just a few degrees , while large opening angles ( @xmath8 ) are inferred at scales of 10 au or less @xcite .",
    "it has been well established that outflow is associated with the accretion phenomenon , with the mass outflow rate on the order of a tenth of the mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the launching and collimation of the jet / outflow in ysos are almost certainly magnetic in nature @xcite , and most likely magneto - centrifugally driven via the @xcite mechanism : outflowing gas launched from the disk can be accelerated along open magnetic field lines centrifugally when the surface poloidal magnetic field is inclined by more than @xmath9 relative to disk normal .",
    "the outflow can be gradually collimated beyond the alfvn point by the magnetic hoop stress from the toroidal field .",
    "the accretion - ejection correlation leads to closer studies of the jet / outflow properties in the vicinity the launching region . using the hubble space telescope ,",
    "evidence of jet rotation has been identified in a number of sources including dg tau and rw aur within the scale of about 100 au from the star @xcite .",
    "although caveats and alternative explanations do exist @xcite , the jet rotation observations can be naturally explained as originating from a magnetic outflow .",
    "based on the conservation laws for axisymmetric magnetic outflows , the location of the jet - launching region can be inferred @xcite , where it was found that the lvc wind in these sources is likely to originate from an extended region in the disk from less than 1 au to a few au @xcite .",
    "the launching region of the hvc is not directly constrained due to the resolution limit , but is likely to be located further inward , and may involve an x - wind @xcite .",
    "further investigations show that the lvc outflow in these systems carries a substantial fraction ( if not all ) of the disk angular momentum in the launching region @xcite .",
    "these observations reveal that the magnetocentrifugal wind is not only responsible for producing the lvc of the outflow in ysos , but is also likely to play a dominant role in driving accretion for the inner region of protoplanetary disks ( ppds )",
    ".    typical accretion rate from ppds in t - tauri systems has been well - established to be about @xmath10 yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "accretion in ppds has conventionally been largely attributed to be due to the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) . due to the weak ionization level which introduces non - ideal magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) effects , especially near the midplane region of the inner disk , accretion in the inner region of ppds",
    "was thought to be layered @xcite , with the mri - driven accretion proceeding in the better - ionized surface layer termed as the active layer , and a more or less laminar midplane region termed as the dead zone .",
    "however , this conventional picture takes into account only the effect of ohmic resistivity , while weakly ionized gas suffers from two other non - ideal mhd effects , namely the hall effect and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) . assuming hall effect has a limited impact on the mri as suggested by simulations ( @xcite , although the hall - dominated regime was not covered in these simulations , @xcite ) , it was shown that the inclusion of ad dramatically reduces the efficiency of the mri , making it far insufficient to account for the large accretion rate observed in typical t - tauri disks @xcite .",
    "these results strongly suggest magnetized outflow as a promising alternative to drive disk accretion , in line with observations @xcite .    in our previous paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) ,",
    "we have performed a series of local shearing - box simulations for a local patch of ppd at a fixed radius of @xmath11 au that for the first time , included both effects of ohmic resistivity and ad , with magnetic diffusion coefficients self - consistently determined from a pre - computed look - up table in real simulation time .",
    "it was shown first that net vertical magnetic flux is essential for driving rapid accretion ( otherwise the mri operates in an extremely inefficient way due to ad ) , in which case even the initial field configuration is unstable to the mri , the system quickly relaxes to a state where the mri is completely suppressed .",
    "this is due to large ohmic resistivity near the disk midplane , and strong ad in the low - density disk surface where the magnetic field becomes too strong for the mri to operate in the ad dominated regime @xcite . instead of the mri ,",
    "the disk launches a strong outflow that is magnetocentrifugal in nature . with a physical wind geometry ( i.e. , the poloidal field / stream lines bend toward the same direction in the shearing - box ) ,",
    "a very weak vertical net flux with midplane plasma @xmath12 ( ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure of the net vertical field ) is sufficient to drive rapid disk accretion with accretion rate of a few times @xmath13 yr@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , accretion is likely to proceed through a thin layer where the horizontal magnetic field changes sign ( strong current layer ) , while the rest of the disk remains static .",
    "this layer is offset from disk midplane ( at about 3 scale heights ) and contains a tiny fraction of disk mass but has large radial drift velocity ( up to @xmath14 times the sound speed ) to carry the accretion mass flux .",
    "the results from paper i is on the one hand surprising that mri no longer operates in the inner disk and the conventional picture of the mri - driven layered accretion becomes problematic since ad was not considered . on the other hand ,",
    "the results lend strong theoretical support to the observational results of jet and outflows from ysos summarized at the beginning of this section .",
    "we note that most earlier theoretical work on disk wind from ppds ( e.g. , @xcite ) generally conclude that strong net vertical magnetic field of equipartition level at disk midplane is needed for wind launching .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that a constant elsasser number ( characterizing the coupling between gas and magnetic field ) profile is assumed across the vertical height of the disk .",
    "the results from paper i indicates that with a realistic prescription on the vertical profile of the ohmic and ambipolar diffusion coefficients , launching of a laminar wind can be achieved with much weaker vertical fields ( in fact , equipartition - level magnetic field near the launching point , which is high above the midplane ) , a result that was noticed @xcite but not widely acknowledged .    in paper i",
    "we have focused on the physical properties and the launching mechanism of the newly - found laminar wind solution , obtained at fixed radius of 1 au in a minimum - mass solar nebular disk ( mmsn , @xcite ) .",
    "it remains to explore the radial range where such laminar wind solution exist . toward smaller radii ,",
    "the disk becomes hotter and eventually thermal ionization of alkali species takes place ( which essentially removes all non - ideal mhd effects ) .",
    "the laminar wind picture would fail , and the gas dynamics is better described by mri in the ideal mhd regime . toward larger radii , the gas in ppds gradually enters the ad dominated regime due to the low density ( beyond @xmath15 au ) .",
    "it has been predicted that mri - driven accretion can successfully account for the observed accretion rate @xcite , which was later confirmed in numerical simulations , where again , vertical net magnetic flux turns out to be essential ( @xcite , see section [ ssec : global ] for more discussions ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to identify the criteria ( e.g. , radial extent ) where the laminar wind solution exists , with main focus on the radial dependence of the wind properties .",
    "based on the discussion above , such laminar wind region must exist in the vicinity of 1 au , but does not extend to the inner edge of the disk , nor to the ad dominated outer disk .",
    "we therefore perform the same simulations as in paper i ( but with some minor updates ) at different disk radii from 0.3 au to 15 au and study the wind properties , especially the role of net magnetic flux on wind - driven accretion , as well as the transition from pure laminar wind toward the radius where mri starts to set in .",
    "piecing together all the simulations results , a global picture concerning the gas dynamics and evolution of ppds is ready to be revealed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our numerical method , model parameters and simulation diagnostics in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "simulation results in quasi-1d and 3d are presented in sections [ sec:1dresults ] and [ sec:3dresults ] respectively . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the criteria for the existence of laminar wind solution and propose a new global picture on the accretion process in ppds , together with concluding remarks .",
    "the methodology adopted in this paper follows exactly from paper i ( with minor updates ) , which we briefly summarize below .",
    "readers should consult the entire section 2 of @xcite for details .",
    ".list of all simulation runs .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     maxwell and reynolds stresses @xmath16 and @xmath17 are measured in the disk zone ( @xmath18 ) , wind stresses @xmath19 are averaged values measured at the wind base @xmath20 .",
    "all 3d simulations eventually have odd-@xmath21 symmetry .",
    "also note that for simulations with weaker net vertical field , the alfvn points are not contained in the simulation box .    in figure",
    "[ fig : scl ] , we further show the radial velocity profiles across the strong current layer in the three runs at @xmath22 au with fixed @xmath12 .",
    "we see that although the thickness of the strong current layers vary considerably in the three cases , their velocity profiles have very similar shapes , with sharper decrease to the midplane side ( since resistivity increases ) .",
    "moreover , at 5 au , we see that the strong current layer is already very thick , and extends even to the disk midplane .",
    "this indicates that the midplane region is already partially coupled to the magnetic field , and we find that in this run , the elsasser numbers at midplane are @xmath23 .",
    "this radius , as we shall discuss in section [ sec:3dresults ] , is close to the outer boundary of the pure laminar accretion zone .      among all our quasi-1d simulations , we find that three of the runs never settle into a laminar state ( s - r3-b6 , s - r5-b6 and s - r8-b5 ) , which are not included in table [ tab:1dresults ] .",
    "these runs show obvious signs of time variability all the time , where all the physical quantities exhibit large amplitude variations especially in the surface layer of the disk , and mass ejection occurs episodically .",
    "we have further tried to initialize runs s - r3-b6 and s - r5-b6 from the time and horizontally averaged profiles from their 3d counterparts , while they evolve into similar situations .",
    "we therefore conclude that laminar solutions can not be found for the combination of parameters in these runs . based on these results",
    ", we note that toward larger radii , progressively larger net vertical flux is required to obtain a steady laminar solution .",
    "obtaining a quasi-1d solution does not necessarily mean that the solution is stable since non - axisymmetric modes are artificially suppressed . in paper",
    "i , we have demonstrated that at 1 au , the laminar solution remains stable in 3d simulations . in this section",
    ", we first check whether the laminar quasi-1d solutions we obtained in the previous section persist in 3d , and we further explore the gas dynamics in the outer region ( up to 15 au ) to identify the transition from the pure laminar wind to the onset of the mri .",
    "for all the 3d simulations , we show the standard diagnostic quantities in table [ tab:3dresults ] , and they will be discussed in the following subsections .",
    "we first consider the two 3d runs f - r3-b5 and f - r5-b5 where laminar solutions were found in quasi-1d simulations . as can be seen in table [ tab:3dresults ] , the value of essentially all their diagnostics agree very well with their quasi-1d counterparts .",
    "the 3d runs exhibit very weak level of turbulent reynolds stress in the disk zone that is of the order @xmath24 or less in natural unit .",
    "this level is much smaller than the level reported in @xcite from the decay of hydrodynamic turbulence , which leaves small amplitude linear modes in shearing - box whose amplitude is well preserved due to the low - level numerical dissipation in the athena code .",
    "therefore , it is consistent with pure laminar flow .",
    "the slight difference in other measured quantities such as @xmath19 and @xmath25 between runs s - r5-b5 ( even symmetry ) and f - r5-b5 ( odd symmetry ) can be attributed to the difference in their symmetry , as one compares runs s - r3-b5a and s - r3-b5b . in sum",
    ", we confirm that the quasi-1d results discussed in section [ sec:1dresults ] are robust in 3d .",
    "results presented in section [ sec:1dresults ] indicate that laminar solution becomes impossible at larger disk radii and smaller net vertical magnetic flux .",
    "the boundary resides at 3 - 5 au for @xmath26 and @xmath27 au for @xmath12 .",
    "correspondingly , we conduct 3d runs for these parameters ( except replacing 8 au to 10 au ) .",
    "these 3d runs show qualitatively similar features in their saturated states , and here we take run f - r10-b5 as a standard example .        in figure",
    "[ fig : fid3dhist ] we show the space - time plot of the horizontally averaged toroidal magnetic field @xmath28 and vertical kinetic energy @xmath29 for run f - r10-b5 .",
    "we see that at the beginning , the system is prone to the mri and evolves into mri turbulence .",
    "this is most evident from the characteristic  butterfly \" pattern in the first @xmath30 orbits , where the mean @xmath31 changes sign over a ( quasi- ) period of about @xmath32 orbits . in this initial phase ,",
    "the mean toroidal field at disk midplane is very weak ( comparable to net vertical field ) , a field geometry that is favorable for the mri in the ad dominated regime ( at disk midplane ) .",
    "we find that the mri turbulence is mainly driven from the midplane region , giving rise to stress level of @xmath33 and is responsible for the dynamo behavior .",
    "the base of the fuv layer is also mri - unstable , but its activity is overwhelmed by the magnetic dynamo behavior buoyantly rising from the midplane .",
    "subsequently , the dynamo disappears , accompanied by the amplification of the mean @xmath31 near the midplane , yet the mean @xmath31 still undergoes a local minimum across the disk midplane .",
    "the system appears to be adjusting itself between @xmath34 , arriving at the final steady - state configuration from @xmath35 on , where the mean @xmath31 profile has a single peak at the midplane .",
    "it appears that the strength of the midplane mean @xmath31 largely controls the turbulent activities : strong @xmath28 leads to weaker midplane turbulence , as one compares the two panels of figure [ fig : fid3dhist ] .",
    "it is unclear what controls the mean toroidal field around disk midplane , but the fact that it takes the system more than 150 orbits to settle to the final state is indicative of its marginal nature on the transition from purely laminar flow to the onset of the mri . to obtain reliable time - averaged quantities",
    ", we have run the simulation further to @xmath36 .",
    "now we focus on the final saturated state of the simulation since @xmath37 . from the space - time plot",
    "we see large time variabilities on @xmath38 take place at both midplane and the surface fuv layer , indicating turbulence is driven at both locations .",
    "the magnetic field is dominantly toroidal , and magnetic fluctuations due to turbulence are much weaker compared with the mean toroidal field , allowing us to extract time - averaged vertical profiles . in figure",
    "[ fig : fid3dprof ] , we show the time - averaged vertical profiles of various quantities analogous to figure [ fig : fid1d ] .",
    "the only difference is that the dashed curves on the top left panel correspond to the turbulent component of ( rather than the full ) @xmath39 .",
    "we observe the following features .    1 ) .",
    "ad is the dominant non - ideal mhd effect all over the disk .",
    "it is strongest at disk midplane , and becomes weaker toward disk surface due to x - ray and fuv ionizations .",
    "ohmic resistivity is totally negligible ( with @xmath40 ) .    2 ) .",
    "both the midplane region and the surface fuv layer show enhanced ( but still weak ) turbulent stress , and turbulence is largely hydrodynamical ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the turbulence at the fuv layer is much more vigorous since the density is much smaller compared with the midplane region .",
    "an outflow is launched , but the flow velocity is much slower compared with the laminar case . the alfvn point is not contained with the simulation box , hence the properties of the outflow may be affected more by the vertical boundary condition ( e.g. , the feature of the @xmath42 profile near vertical boundary in figure [ fig : fid3dprof ] ) .",
    "we note that the alfvn point moves away from midplane as one reduces the net vertical magnetic flux ( @xcite , paper i ) , the fact that the alfvn point falls beyond the simulation box is consistent with smaller net magnetic flux and weaker outflow .    the mri turbulence in the midplane region merits some more discussion . within @xmath43 , we see from figure [ fig : fid3dprof ] that @xmath44 with a flat vertical profile , and @xmath45 in code unit with a relatively flat vertical profile as well .",
    "we note that the presence of mean toroidal field significantly changes the dispersion relation of the mri . using the general dispersion relation derived by @xcite",
    ", we find that given these parameters , the most unstable mri mode correspond to @xmath46 , with fastest growth rate of @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the most unstable modes can be properly fitted into our simulation box . according to the simulation results from @xcite , under the most favorable magnetic geometry , the resulting turbulent stress is of the order @xmath49 for @xmath44 ( see their equations ( 24 ) and ( 26 ) ) . in our case ,",
    "the field geometry is highly toroidal field dominated with @xmath50 .",
    "note that this is close to the least favorable field geometry for @xmath51 of order unity @xcite , and the low level of turbulent stress ( @xmath52 , see table [ tab:3dresults ] ) in the midplane is consistent with theoretical expectations .    in sum",
    ", we find that in this marginal case , ohmic resistivity becomes irrelevant and mri operates at both disk midplane and surface fuv layer .",
    "the level of the turbulence and efficiency of turbulent angular momentum transport in the midplane is low because of a toroidal - dominated magnetic field configuration near the midplane region .",
    "the surface fuv layer is much more turbulent but is not very efficient to transport angular momentum due to its low density .       as a function of net vertical magnetic flux ( characterized by @xmath53 ) measured from all our 3d simulations with midplane turbulence .",
    "different symbols correspond to simulations at different radii .",
    "dashed lines show the fitting formula ( [ eq : fittm ] ) obtained from ( quasi-1d ) laminar wind simulations for each radii ( from 3au to 15 au , bottom to top ) .",
    "all quantities are in code units .",
    "note significant deviations from the laminar - wind fitting formula.,width=321 ]    in this subsection we discuss the rest of the 3d simulations ( all except the two mentioned in section [ sec:3dresultslaminar ] ) .",
    "we start from the two runs at 3 au and 5 au with @xmath26 .",
    "the midplane region in these two cases still has large ohmic resistivity , hence the mri does not operate there .",
    "however , very weak mri turbulence is excited in the fuv layer . from table",
    "[ tab:3dresults ] , we see that the turbulent stresses are systematically larger than the two 3d companion runs with @xmath12 ( i.e. , laminar wind cases ) , indicating that mri is in operation .",
    "this is further confirmed by looking at the mri dispersion relation . at the fuv front ( located at @xmath54 ) ,",
    "the gas density in these two cases is around @xmath55 . with @xmath26 ,",
    "the most unstable wavelength is approximately @xmath56 .",
    "although this simple analysis ignores stratification , the relatively small wavelength indicates the viability of the mri .",
    "however , due to the low density in the fuv layer , the resulting value of @xmath57 is extremely small ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "for the four runs at 10 au and 15 au , ad becomes the dominant non - ideal mhd effects throughout the disk , and mri turbulence sets in both from the midplane and from the fuv layer .",
    "the properties of these runs at saturation are all very similar to the fiducial case f - r10-b5 discussed in detail earlier . among them , run f - r10-b4 appears closest to the laminar case , with a negative turbulent maxwell stress ( @xmath59 ) and also a smallest @xmath60 compared with the other three .",
    "this run is parametrically similar to our quasi-1d run s - r8-b4 where pure laminar configuration is stable .",
    "being located slightly outward , it does show some turbulent behavior and we find that both the midplane region and the fuv layer is marginally unstable to the mri . at this location of 10 au",
    ", we expect a purely laminar configuration with slightly stronger net vertical flux .",
    "similarly , we expect unambiguous mri turbulence at larger radii with fixed @xmath53 , which is indeed the case as in our run f - r15-b4 .    for 3d runs with mri turbulence ,",
    "we find that the scaling relations ( [ eq : fitmw ] ) and ( [ eq : fittm ] ) no longer hold . as an example",
    ", we show in figure [ fig:3dparam ] the wind stresses from these 3d runs and compare them with expectations from the laminar wind fitting formula .",
    "we find that in the presence of turbulence , the dependence of wind stress on net vertical magnetic flux is more steep : @xmath19 from runs f - r3-b6 and f - r5-b6 fall significantly from expectations , while @xmath19 from runs f - r10-b4 and f - r15-b4 are well above ( but note the caveat that in simulations with weaker fields , the alfvn points are not contained in the simulation box ) .",
    "these results set the radial range where the laminar wind fitting formulas are applicable .",
    "we note that in all these 3d simulations , turbulence only contributes to a small fraction of the total stress @xmath39 .",
    "the dominant contribution is from the maxwell stress due to large - scale magnetic field ( i.e. , magnetic breaking ) . using equation ( [ eq : accrete ] ) , we see that to have an accretion rate of @xmath13 yr@xmath2 , the required value of @xmath61 is about @xmath62 at @xmath63 au . from the simulations ,",
    "the measured @xmath16 is a bit small but close to this level .",
    "we also note that in quasi-1d runs at inner disk radii , the level of @xmath64 at @xmath65 is also substantial . also from 1d simulations",
    ", we see that under the physical symmetry ( with field flip and a strong current layer ) , the value of @xmath64 is slightly smaller than ( but on the same order of ) the case under the unphysical odd-@xmath21 symmetry .",
    "these results together suggest magnetic breaking can potentially play a non - negligible role in angular momentum transport . au . in the inner disk",
    ", @xmath66 is sufficient for rapid wind - driven accretion , where contribution from @xmath64 is less than @xmath67 . ] for a physical scenario where horizontal field flips within the disk , our quasi-1d runs have implied that at larger disk radii , the flip is likely to take place close to the midplane at large radii , and the thickness of this  strong current layer \" can be large ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the midplane region is likely to have very weak toroidal field , and such field geometry is more favorable for the mri turbulence in the ad dominated regime .",
    "it is likely that radial transport of angular momentum ( i.e. , mri and magnetic breaking ) becomes progressively important toward the outer disk , while at least up to the range of @xmath63 au , magnetocentrifugal wind can still play a dominant role in this process : the required level of wind stress @xmath19 at @xmath63 au is about @xmath69 ( for accretion rate of @xmath13 yr@xmath2 ) , which is easily accounted for with @xmath12 .",
    "piecing together all simulations presented in the present paper and paper i , we show in figure [ fig : summary ] the parameter space we have explored , indicating whether a laminar solution is possible .",
    "clearly , laminar solutions can be found in the inner disk less than @xmath32 au .",
    "the radius where turbulence sets in depends on the strength of the net vertical magnetic field . with relatively strong net vertical field @xmath70",
    ", the purely laminar zone could extend to about 10 au , while for much weaker net vertical field @xmath71 , the purely laminar zone could shrink to 3 au .",
    "we emphasize that even though we have labeled  turbulent \" in much of parameter space in figure [ fig : summary ] , the level of turbulence can be extremely weak .",
    "in particular , for the two symbols at 3 au and 5au with @xmath26 , extremely weak turbulence only exists in the the surface fuv layer , and the bulk of the disk is still largely laminar . even at 10 au and 15 au , where turbulence exists at both disk midplane and the fuv layer for @xmath72 , the transport coefficient is of the order @xmath73 or less .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : accrete ] ) and ( [ eq : fittm ] ) and under the assumption that the laminar solution exists , we further draw two dash - dotted lines in figure [ fig : summary ] showing the expected parameter for the disk to maintain steady state wind - driven accretion rate of @xmath74 and @xmath75 yr@xmath2 .",
    "it clearly shows the importance of the laminar wind solutions at the inner disks within 10 au .",
    "although the parameter space marked by red circles does not obey our fitting formula ( [ eq : fittm ] ) , the deviation is not substantial ( see figure [ fig:3dparam ] ) , and we may still use the dash - dotted lines as a reference .    combining the results with the studies in paper i , the criteria for the existence of the laminar wind solution can be readily inferred .",
    "we emphasize that we do _ not _ attempt to provide quantitative and general criteria for mri suppression and wind launching .",
    "instead , we design these criteria specifically for qualitatively understanding the launching laminar winds from ppds , as follows .    * strong ohmic resistivity ( @xmath76 ) in the midplane region , which is necessary to suppress the mri around disk midplane .",
    "* strong ad dominated disk upper layer , which is essential to suppress the mri at disk surface .",
    "* the presence of ( not too weak ) net vertical magnetic flux , otherwise the mri does operate but works extremely inefficiently . *",
    "sufficient ionization beyond disk surface ( @xmath77 ) , which is essential for wind mass loading .     plane , assuming a mmsn disk model .",
    "blue squares denote the existence of laminar wind solution , while red circles mean the disk has to be turbulent , though turbulence is very weak with stress level of the order @xmath78 or less .",
    "two dash - dotted lines indicate the desired @xmath53 as a function of radius for wind - driven accretion rate of @xmath74 and @xmath75 yr@xmath2 ( based on equations ( [ eq : accrete ] ) and ( [ eq : fittm ] ) for mmsn disks).,width=340 ]    we note that the dominance of ad in the disk surface layer is always the case due to the low density , while strong ohmic resistivity at disk midplane is only possible in the inner region of ppds .",
    "this is the essence why such laminar wind solution does not extend to the outer disk beyond 10 au as we have confirmed in this paper .",
    "the requirement of not - too - weak magnetic field is mainly to avoid the mri in the surface fuv layer . since the fuv ionization penetrates deeper in the outer disk ( under the assumption of constant penetration column ) , stronger field ( measured in @xmath53 ) is required toward outer disk to suppress the mri in the fuv layer , which explains the trend in figure [ fig : summary ] .",
    "another point of clarification again involves the magnetic field strength .",
    "it is well known that the mri can be suppressed with sufficiently strong magnetic field with / without non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "in fact , conventional wind launching criterion which requires near - equipartition field strength is partly to avoid the mri . in ppds , if field strength approaches this level , other criteria outlined in this subsection would become meaningless .",
    "however , the conventional wind scenario would result in excessively strong mass loss and accretion unless the disk is substantially depleted @xcite . also , wind launching will be dramatically suppressed for field strength beyond equipartition @xcite .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper , we always limit ourselves to field strength much weaker than equipartition ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the main reason we are able to find laminar wind solution with field strength much weaker than equipartition is that we have adopted a realistic ionization profile ( rather than constant elsasser number profile ) , where suppression of the mri by ohmic dominated midplane is essential .      in paper",
    "i , we have emphasized the importance of net vertical magnetic flux : it is the sufficient and necessary requirement to drive rapid accretion in the inner region of ppds . in the outer region of ppds ( e.g. , beyond 30 au ) where mri - driven accretion is likely to dominate @xcite ,",
    "the presence of net magnetic flux has also been shown to be crucial @xcite , otherwise the mri would simply be too inefficient .",
    "the rate of angular momentum transport due to either disk wind or the mri depends sensitively on the amount of net vertical magnetic flux threading the disk .",
    "therefore , the global distribution of poloidal magnetic flux in ppds is the key to understanding the accretion process in ppds .",
    "here we focus on the inner disk region with laminar accretion , and ask the question of what distribution of poloidal magnetic flux would result in steady state accretion with accretion rate consistent with observations ? our starting point is the fitting formula ( [ eq : fittm ] ) in section [ ssec:1dresultsparam ] . following the discussion in that section ,",
    "we convert @xmath53 in the mmsn disk model to physical magnetic field strength , and further use equation ( [ eq : accrete ] ) , to find the wind - driven accretion rate to be @xmath80 we note that this formula applies only in the laminar region of the disk .",
    "uncertainties with this formula mainly arise from the treatment fuv ionization , and the assumption of the mmsn temperature profile , but they should only introduce minor corrections ( recall from table 4 of paper i , varying the fuv penetration depth by a factor of 10 leads to difference in @xmath19 by a factor of about 2 ) .    clearly , this formula shows that large - scale poloidal field strength of about @xmath32 mg at 1 au is needed to drive accretion with the typical observed rate of @xmath13 yr@xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that surface density does not enter the formula above , a result identified in paper i , and sustaining steady - state accretion requires that the radial distribution of net vertical magnetic field follows @xmath81 .",
    "in other words , using @xmath82 to denote the total poloidal magnetic flux contained within disk radius @xmath83 , it should follow the law of @xmath84 .",
    "questions remain regarding the transport of poloidal magnetic flux in ppds : how can poloidal magnetic flux be arranged to arrive at the desired configuration .",
    "most studies on magnetic flux transport in accretion disks assume balance between advection due to viscous accretion and diffusion due to resistivity @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for wind - driven accretion .",
    "as was discussed in paper i , the solutions obtained in our simulations has zero toroidal electric field , corresponding to a stationary magnetic flux distribution .",
    "in other words , inward advection due to wind - driven accretion is balanced exactly by the outward diffusion in the strong current layer .",
    "although this is mainly a consequence of the shearing - box approach , such stationary magnetic flux distribution is desirable property of the wind solution .",
    "we note that other wind solutions are still possible with non - zero advection velocity of magnetic flux , which generally require global approach .",
    "simulations from our paper i demonstrated a robust result that the mri is likely to be suppressed in the inner region of ppds , while magnetocentrifugal wind can be launched due to the large - scale poloidal magnetic flux threading the disk .",
    "compiling further from all simulations presented in this paper , which cover a much wider range of disk radii , a new global picture on the accretion process in ppds emerges .",
    "this new scenario is illustrated schematically in figure [ fig : newpic ] , which contrasts with the conventional picture of layered accretion ( @xcite , see also figure 7 of @xcite ) .      * the innermost region ( region i ) , where the gas is sufficiently hot ( @xmath85k ) to thermally ( collisionally ) ionize alkali metals ( na and k ) .",
    "the gas behaves in the ideal mhd regime , and the entire disk is highly turbulent due to the mri . *",
    "the inner region ( region ii ) , where the disk is largely laminar due to the combined effects of ohmic resistivity and ad .",
    "angular momentum transport is dominantly driven by the magnetocentrifugal wind , and accretion proceeds through a strong current layer that is offset from disk midplane . * the outer region ( region iii ) , where mri is likely to be the dominant mechanism for angular momentum transport , but its strength is relatively weak due to strong ad .      in region",
    "i , the gas dynamics can be inferred from ideal - mhd shearing - box simulations of the mri .",
    "we note that since net vertical magnetic flux is essential for driving rapid accretion for other parts ( regions ii and iii ) of the disks , such net vertical flux is also likely to be present in the innermost region of the disk .",
    "moreover , since this region is close to the star , it can also be threaded with some stellar magnetic flux .",
    "the behavior of the mri in the presence of net vertical flux in the ideal mhd regime has recently been explored in great detail @xcite .",
    "it was found that an outflow is always launched , which is highly unsteady and its mass outflow rate increases with net vertical flux similar to our laminar wind case .",
    "however , it was argued that the outflow launched from an mri - turbulent disk is unlikely to be _ directly _ connected to a global wind either due to the mri dynamo or symmetry issues @xcite .",
    "moreover , strong interaction with the protostellar magnetosphere is also expected in the inner part of region i , which also likely launches powerful and highly dynamic outflows @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use dashed arrows in figure [ fig : newpic ] to illustrate such unsteady outflow whose fate remains to be explored .",
    "the outer boundary of region i lies where the temperature drops below about @xmath86 k. within region i , viscous heating is generally the dominant heating source , and for typical accretion rate of @xmath13 yr@xmath2 , the location where @xmath87 drops below @xmath86 k is around @xmath88 au ( e.g. , figure 2 of @xcite , yet the exact location depends on model parameters ) .",
    "since thermal ionization depends extremely sensitively on temperature near the threshold , the transition from region i to region ii should be abrupt , yet it would be very interesting to explore the gas dynamics near the interface connecting the fully turbulent region and the full laminar region .",
    "region ii has been discussed extensively in paper i and this paper .",
    "it covers the radial range where the four criteria identified in section [ ssec : criteria ] are met , and extends from the outer boundary of region i to some outer radius .",
    "we note that at @xmath89 au , the disk wind is sufficient to drive rapid accretion at @xmath89 au even with weak field @xmath26 . although the thin fuv surface layer is expected to be weakly turbulent , the bulk of the disk can still considered to be largely laminar .",
    "therefore , we may relax our criterion 3 ( of section 5.1 ) and consider region ii to extend to an outer radius of somewhere between 5 - 10 au . slightly beyond the outer boundary of region ii where ohmic resistivity becomes unimportant ,",
    "mri starts to operate at disk midplane .",
    "however , because of strong ad and relatively strong toroidal - domianted magnetic field configuration near midplane , turbulence resulting from the mri is very weak .",
    "while magnetic breaking due to large - scale radial and toroidal fields could play a non - negligible role on angular momentum transport , magnetocentrifugal wind is still most likely the dominant mechanism to drive disk accretion , provided an even-@xmath21 symmetry continues to apply .",
    "the wind stress and mass loss rate no longer follow the scaling relations ( equations ( [ eq : fitmw ] ) and ( [ eq : fittm ] ) ) identified for the laminar wind region ( region ii ) due to the presence of mri turbulence at disk midplane and fuv layer .",
    "region iii is not covered in our numerical simulations .",
    "however , earlier works suggest that mri alone is capable of driving rapid accretion to feed the inner disk if under a favorable magnetic field geometry and with the assistance of tiny grains and/or fuv ionization @xcite . here , favorable field geometry refers to the magnetic configuration with both net vertical and mean toroidal magnetic fields , with the toroidal component a few times stronger @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite explored the gas dynamics in region iii with shearing - box simulations .",
    "they focused at two disk radii , 30 au and 100 au , and found that 1 ) net vertical magnetic flux is essential to drive rapid accretion , 2 ) the mri - driven accretion rate is a strong function of net vertical magnetic flux .",
    "there is also outflow from the simulations as a natural consequence of net vertical flux .",
    "while the fate of the outflow is again uncertain for reasons similar to that in region i , mri is the dominant source of angular momentum transport .",
    "it is very likely that there is a transition zone that covers a relatively wide range of radii between region ii and region iii ( e.g. , from @xmath90 au to @xmath91 au ) , where the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism shifts _ gradually _ from disk wind to the mri / magnetic braking .",
    "moreover , the hall effect , which is not included in our studies , is the dominant non - ideal mhd effect in such transition radii",
    ". it will be extremely interesting to explore the transition using global simulations .",
    "our simulations have demonstrated the magnetocentrifugal wind is an essential ingredient for driving accretion in the inner region of ppds .",
    "although we are unable to provide large - scale kinematics of the disk wind based on our local shearing - box simulations , the range of radii where we expect such disk wind is consistent with the inferred launching radii of the low - velocity component of the molecular outflows from observations @xcite .",
    "the laminar nature of the gas flow in the inner disk has important implications on grain growth in ppds , planetesimal formation , and potentially planet migration , which all merit future investigations .",
    "the global picture proposed in this paper represents a large - scale framework , while the details of the picture remain to be explored with a lot more efforts .",
    "in particular , the hall effect that was not included in our simulations is the dominant non - ideal mhd effect in a large portion of parameter space in ppds and may play an important role on the mhd stability of the disk .",
    "moreover , global simulations are essential to address the stability of the strong current layer , the transition between regions i , ii and iii outlined in the previous subsection , and the transport of large - scale poloidal magnetic flux .",
    "global simulations are also necessary to quantify the kinematics of the disk wind , such as the rate and velocity of the mass outflow , and to make direct comparisons with observations .",
