    "@xcite inferred observational evidence that the bh mass correlates with the velocity dispersion of globular cluster systems in their host galaxies ; the relation having a flatter slope , a higher normalization , and less scatter .",
    "we perform one isolated galaxy simulation ( _ kine2 _ case ) with @xmath245 times higher resolution ( run _ hi - res _ ) , to test resolution effects .",
    "we find that the _ hi - res _ results are qualitatively similar to that of _ kine2 _ , but not technically converged .",
    "the sfr depends on the resolved gas density , while bh growth depends on sfr through the local gas properties , because sf depletes gas , reducing that available for bh accretion .",
    "therefore full convergence can not be expected with the same parameter values of the subgrid models .",
    "the sfr is more in the _ hi - res _ case , since higher densities are resolved , and the mass of new stars formed is @xmath280 larger , consequently the bh is @xmath279 times less - massive at @xmath110 gyr , and less gas mass outflows after @xmath281 gyr .",
    "the lack of convergence of the bh mass implies that different model parameters ( e.g. @xmath79 ) are required to have the same @xmath2 $ ] fit at different resolution . here",
    "a rigorous numerical convergence would first require tuning of the sf model parameters .",
    "e.g. , @xcite found that their sf prescription requires higher density thresholds at increased resolutions .",
    "we find that the fluctuating nature of the rapidly varying quantities ( bhar and sfr in fig .",
    "[ fig - bhaccr - starform - rate ] ) remain the same between _ kine2 _ and _ hi - res _ cases .",
    "our results demonstrate that the current implementation of bh thermal feedback has essentially no effect within the framework of the standard multiphase star - formation model @xcite , where sf is based on a density threshold only .",
    "the thermal energy deposited to the gas particles which are multiphase ( star - forming ) is radiated away instantaneously , since they are dense . and",
    "they attain the effective equation - of - state temperature dictated by their density .",
    "this process might even induce sf by heating , since increasing the temperature of a multiphase particle makes the cold - phase more pressurized .",
    "this mimics the positive agn feedback phenomenon of triggering starbursts by agn outflows , when they compress clumpy gas clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the non - effectiveness of the thermal feedback is aggravated in our models by the hole detection numerical algorithm (  [ sec - num - holeprevent ] ) , first used in this study .",
    "the sfr in our simulations is directly proportional to the gas mass inside @xmath282 kpc , implying that sf quenching happens by removal of gas .",
    "we extrapolate that all the studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the bh numerical methodology of @xcite are plagued by such artefacts : those incur a thermal feedback induced sf quenching by gas depletion via the creation of a hole around the bh location , and not actually by heating the gas .",
    "however we limit the expansion of the hole using our novel numerical technique , which restricts the gas depletion , therefore allows sf to occur unrestricted , bounding the impact of sf reduction .",
    "note that @xcite employed schemes to solve these problems , and the improved bh subgrid model has been used in their subsequent cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite showed analytically that when @xmath44 is adopted , the bhar of massive bhs is eddington - limited ( i.e. independent of density ) down to very low gas density , and drop below eddington only at even lower densities .",
    "they introduced a density - dependent @xmath30 factor in the bondi rate , which enables a bh to lower its accretion rate at higher gas densities , overall reducing the possibility of creating an artificial hole in the gas distribution .",
    "furthermore @xcite made thermal agn feedback efficient by setting a minimum heating temperature of @xmath283 k , and allowing strongly heated gas ( even if denser than sf threshold ) to leave the effective sf equation - of - state .",
    "modifications are needed in the bh thermal feedback subgrid model in order to make it effective .",
    "one amendment is to not allow the thermally heated gas to form stars , to ensure the negative nature of agn feedback . in subgrid models",
    "this amount to imposing an upper temperature threshold for sf , such that only gas at lower temperatures form stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . an alternative method for bh thermal energy distribution",
    "is described in appendix a4 of @xcite .",
    "the efficient implementation of thermal sne feedback in galaxy simulations is a related issue ; @xcite prescribed a scheme where the gas is heated to a minimum heating temperature and shows strong feedback effects .",
    "the mass of newly formed stars together with the initial disk and bulge stars , plotted in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig - xy - yz - isolated ] , is indistinguishable between the three runs ( _ sf _ , _ th1 _ , _ kine1 _ ) .",
    "we checked that at @xmath284 gyr , the mass of new stars formed is the same for the no - bh and thermal feedback cases , and 0.8 times smaller in the kinetic feedback model .",
    "however this new star mass ( @xmath285 ) is @xmath286 times smaller than the combined disk and bulge stellar components present in the initial galaxy models ( @xmath287 , table  [ table - galaxies ] ) .",
    "thus the total stellar mass is dominated by the old stars of disk and bulge , and the newly formed ones contribute just a small fraction .",
    "the @xmath142 profiles of the merged galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig - radial - profiles - merger ] ) reveal that the differences between the models are most prominent in the lower - mass and fiducial galaxies ( of total masses @xmath288 and @xmath289 ) , where kinetic feedback results up to @xmath290 times higher @xmath142 than thermal , within @xmath291 kpc .",
    "hence we infer that the cgm gas at such galactocentric distances can give the best @xmath142 observational diagnostic to distinguish between various bh feedback models .",
    "other studies also find that kinetic agn feedback can uplift metals from galaxy to @xmath37s of kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making metallicity diagnostics an excellent way to differentiate feedback models .",
    "we note the possibility that parts of an outflow might effectively change type between kinetic and thermal .",
    "a kinetically - driven outflow , which is generally a fast wind , can shock and thermalize along its path in the central regions of the galaxy , and parts of it may turn to a slow thermal outflow .",
    "a thermally - driven wind , which is hot and isotropic , can evaporate cold clumps , generating fast kinetic wind components .",
    "however signatures of the original distinct feedback mode : isotropic thermal blast versus bipolar kinetic wind , remain different , which we try to diagnose in our study by the different galaxy properties .",
    "physical processes like fragmentation , instabilities and turbulence are important , occurring on small - scales within the galaxy ism or in the outflows .",
    "however the resolution of our simulations is too low to model these phenomena .",
    "the gas particle mass is @xmath292 ( table  [ table - galaxies ] ) in our fiducial galaxy , and the gravitational softening length is @xmath293 kpc . in order to study the effects of instabilities , sub - pc resolution is required .",
    "e.g. simulations by @xcite ( where the gas particle mass is @xmath294 ) and @xcite found thermal - instability driven fragmentation .",
    "thus our too coarse resolution renders it impossible to explore such small - scale processes .",
    "intuitively , in the presence of hydrodynamic instabilities ( such as kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor ) and/or thermal instability , the outflows would have lower velocities and higher mass outflow rates by entrainment of more gas .",
    "the morphological differences of the various feedback modes would then be somewhat reduced .",
    "however , over several gyr , the bh mass is expected to remain the same via self - regulation .",
    "we investigate different modes of agn feedback in galaxy simulations .",
    "we examine two physical ways in which the feedback energy from a bh is coupled to the neighbouring gas : _ thermal _ - where the temperature is increased , and _ kinetic _ - where the velocity is boosted .",
    "we formulate kinetic feedback models with two free parameters : feedback efficiency and agn wind velocity .",
    "the models are implemented in the treepm - sph code gadget-3 : gas particles are stochastically selected from the neighbours and imparted an one - time @xmath1 boost .",
    "we incorporate a novel numerical algorithm to detect the existence of a hole in the gas distribution around the bh , and prevent its expansion .",
    "the code includes additional sub - resolution physics : metal - dependent radiative cooling and heating ; star formation ; stellar evolution and chemical enrichment .",
    "we perform simulations of isolated and merging disk galaxies , of total mass @xmath295 ( similar as the milky - way ) in our fiducial case .",
    "each initial galaxy model contains @xmath296 dark matter , @xmath297 disk gas , @xmath298 disk star , and @xmath298 bulge star particles .",
    "new stars form during the simulation , and in our analysis of @xmath144 all the stars are counted .",

    "two equal - mass isolated galaxies are set on a parabolic collision course .",
    "we perform runs with the same non - agn physics , and varying the agn feedback models :    - star - formation and chemical enrichment only ( no bh ) ,    - thermal bh feedback ,    - kinetic bh feedback with energy - driven wind prescription ,    - kinetic bh feedback with momentum - driven wind .",
