    "parity invariance has played a critical role in the evolution of our understanding of the weak interaction .",
    "indeed one could argue that it was the experiment of wu _",
    "et al._@xcite motivated by the suggestion of lee and yang@xcite that led to reexamination of the symmetry properties of _ all _ interactions and thereby to essentially all of the experiments discussed in this book ! be that as it may , it is clear that this work led in 1958 to feynman and gell - mann s postulate of the @xmath1 interaction for charged currents@xcite , which , when combined with weinberg s introduction of the neutral current a decade later@xcite , essentially completed our picture of the weak force . since that time careful experimental work has led to verification of nearly every aspect of the proposed weak interaction structure    * in the leptonic sector_e.g .",
    "_ @xmath2 ; * in the @xmath3 semileptonic sector_e.g .",
    "_ @xmath4 * in the @xmath5 nonleptonic sector_e.g .",
    "_ @xmath6    however , there is one area missing from this itemization  the @xmath7 nonleptonic interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath8 . obviously there is nothing in the identity of the particles involved to reveal the difference between this weak interaction and the ordinary strong @xmath8 process .",
    "in fact the weak nn component is dwarfed by the much larger strong nn force but is detectable by the property of parity violation , which it alone possesses .    on the experimental side , the first search for parity violation in the nn interaction",
    "was carried out by tanner@xcite in 1957 , but it was not until 1967 that convincing evidence was presented for its existence by lobashov _",
    "et al._@xcite , who by using integration methods as opposed to particle counting , was able to find a @xmath9 signal among the much larger parity conserving strong background in radiative neutron capture from @xmath10ta . that this should be the size of a weak parity violating effect is clear from a simple scaling argument relating the parity violating and parity conserving nucleon - nucleon potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the weak coupling constant .",
    "more than a quarter - century has now elapsed since the lobashov measurement and many elegant ( and difficult ) experiments have been performed in this field .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see , there remain deep and unresolved questions .",
    "the reason for this is that while the @xmath7 parity violating interaction is simple at the quark level , experiments involve , of necessity , strongly interacting hadrons , and making a convincing connection between an experimental signal and the fundamental hamiltonian which it underlies has proven to be extraordinarily difficult .",
    "lest one underestimate the difficulty involved , the reader is reminded that in the related @xmath5 nonleptonic sector , the dynamical origin of the @xmath15 rule remains a mystery despite three decades of vigorous experimental activity@xcite .",
    "nevertheless much has been learned in the process and it is the purpose of this chapter to review the present situation in the field .    in doing",
    "so we are aided substantially by previous workers in this area , and in particular by the excellent review article prepared nearly a decade ago by adelberger and haxton.@xcite here we primarily summarize progress in experiments and interpretation since that time .",
    "in this section we examine the parity - nonconserving nn potential and its relation to the underlying weak interaction from which it is derived .",
    "since we will be dealing with low energy processes , we can represent the weak interaction in terms of its local form  a point interaction of two currents @xmath16 where , omitting contributions from the heavy ( c , b , t ) quarks , @xmath17\\nonumber\\\\ % % following line can not be broken before 80 char j_\\mu^n&=&\\bar{u}\\gamma_\\mu(1+\\gamma_5)u-\\bar{d}\\gamma_\\mu(1+\\gamma_5)d\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\bar{s}\\gamma_\\mu(1+\\gamma_5)s-4\\sin^2\\theta_wj_\\mu^{\\rm em}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the charged and neutral weak currents respectively .",
    "here @xmath18 are the cabibbo and weinberg angles while @xmath19 is the electromagnetic current@xcite .",
    "one set of rigorous statements which _ can _ be made involves the isotopic spin structure of the parity violating weak hamiltonian , which can assume the values 0,1,2 .",
    "in particular the effective @xmath20 hamiltonian receives contributions only from the product of isovector charged currents @xmath21 on the other hand the effective @xmath22 hamiltonian arise s from both charged and neutral currents @xmath23 since @xmath24 and @xmath25 , however , we expect that the primary contribution comes from the product of isoscalar and isovector neutral currents . finally , the effective @xmath26 hamiltonian receives significant contributions from _ both _ neutral and charged currents @xmath27 now while such relations are easy to write down at the quark level , their implications for the nucleon - nucleon system are much more subtle .",
    "the reason is that , because of the heaviness of the w , z , the low energy weak interaction is essentially pointlike  of zero range .",
    "but the nucleon - nucleon interaction has a strong repulsion at small distances so that the probability of nucleons interacting at short range is essentially nil_i.e .",
    "_ , there is virtually no _ direct _ weak nn interaction .",
    "rather it is known that the ordinary ( parity conserving ) low energy nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath11 can be represented to a high degree of precision in terms of a sum of single ( @xmath28 ) and multiple meson ( @xmath29 ) exchanges@xcite .",
    "we would expect then that its parity - violating counterpart @xmath12 can be represented in like fashion , except that now one meson - nucleon vertex is weak and parity violating , while the other is strong and parity conserving .",
    "consequently , all of the weak interaction physics is contained within the values of these parity violating nnm coupling constants .    because of the  hard core \" associated with the nucleon - nucleon interaction , it is customary to include only mesons of mass less than 800 mev or so , and our task is further simplified by use of barton s theorem@xcite , which asserts that exchange of neutral and spinless mesons between on - shell nucleons is forbidden by cp invariance .",
    "therefore only @xmath30 and @xmath31 vertices need be considered and the form of the most general parity violating effective hamiltonian is easily found : @xmath32 we see that there are in general seven unknown weak couplings @xmath33 .",
    "however , calculations indicate that @xmath34 is quite small@xcite and this term is generally omitted , leaving parity violating observables to be described in terms of just six constants",
    ". the means by which one attempts to determine these couplings experimentally will be described shortly . however , before doing so we shall examine the theoretical predictions for the size of these vertices from the underlying weak interaction .",
    "one of the first estimates of the weak parity violating vertex constants was provided in the early 1960 s .",
    "michel@xcite estimated the charged current couplings to vector mesons using the so - called factorization approximation , which replaces a sum over a complete set of intermediate states by only the vacuum state contribution @xmath35 the justification for this approximation is basically that it is possible and easy to calculate .",
    "there is no reason to believe that it provides anything other than an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "the next major theoretical development occurred in 1970 with the realization that the charged current contribution to pion production could be written using su(3 ) symmetry in terms of _ experimental _ parity violating hyperon decay amplitudes@xcite @xmath36 unfortunately , this result is not as convincing as it appears , since it involves a substantial cancellation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 decay amplitudes and is therefore rather sensitive to possible su(3 ) breaking effects@xcite .",
    "three years later mckellar and pick@xcite showed how the symmetry @xmath39 could be applied to the @xmath7 parity violating interaction , thereby relating pion and vector meson emission amplitudes .",
    "they determined that the vector meson amplitudes predicted via symmetry were of opposite sign and considerably larger than those given by factorization thereby ameliorating an experimental sign discrepancy which existed at that time .",
    "however , this approach too was incomplete in that i ) there were additional su(6 ) couplings which were _ not _ predictable from experimental data and ii ) because of its non-@xmath1 character one could not treat the neutral current hamiltonian in terms of this approach .    a comprehensive calculation which included all previous results and which enabled predictions to be made for all nnm couplings from both charged and neutral current pieces of the weak hamiltonian was performed in 1980 by desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh)@xcite .",
    "although additional calculations have been performed during the intervening years@xcite , nearly all are very similar in method and/or yield numerical results which are qualitatively similar to those of ddh , so we shall spend some time summarizing this work .",
    "the basic idea of the work of ddh is use of the valence quark model , within which the nucleon can be constructed in terms of three quark creation operators @xmath40 where we imagine the spins , isospins to be combined to form components of a spin , isospin doublet and the colors to be contracted to form a singlet .",
    "likewise we can construct the vector and pseudoscalar mesons via @xmath41 using quark and antiquark creation operators .",
    "the weak hamiltonian itself has a local current - current structure and involves four quark fields @xmath42 a generic nnm weak matrix element then is of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents a complicated radial integral .",
    "the vacuum expectation value is tedious to calculate but doable .",
    "thus one finds @xmath45 which is in the form of a wigner - eckart theorem , where the known  geometrical factor \" is a clebsch - gordan coefficient and @xmath44 represents a reduced matrix element , which is identical for all such transitions and may be determined empirically by comparing one such amplitude with its experimental value .",
    "in fact when this procedure is followed for the simple charged current hamiltonian the @xmath39 results of mckellar and pick are exactly reproduced . however , within the quark model based procedure one can treat the neutral current matrix elements on an equal footing . also , since the @xmath46- and @xmath47-meson masses are so different it is essential to include @xmath48 breaking effects , and the quark model offers a means of doing this .    while details can be found in ref .",
    "17 , the results can be summarized in terms of three different types of reduced matrix elements as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "figure 1a represents the factorization diagrams with the vector or pseudoscalar meson connecting to the vacuum through either the @xmath49 or @xmath50 current respectively , multiplied by the nucleon - nucleon matrix element of the @xmath50 or @xmath49 current .",
    "the remaining two diagrams are of a different character and correspond to more complicated baryonic intermediate states .",
    "figure 1b can be shown to correspond to the su(3 ) sum rule of eq .",
    "note that since the hyperon decay amplitudes are themselves proportional to @xmath51 the charged current hamiltonian contribution to pion emission is proportional to @xmath52 and is strongly suppressed .",
    "however , this is _ not _ the case for the corresponding neutral current contribution , which is of @xmath53 and consequently dominates the pion emission amplitude .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "1c represents the new contribution to the vector / pseudoscalar emission identified by mckellar and pick .    despite the understanding gained by connecting the quark model and symmetry based calculations",
    ", ddh emphasized that there remain major difficulties in attempts to provide reliable numerical estimates for these weak parity violating couplings .",
    "these include uncertainty in    * the ( large ) s - p factorization term due to its dependence on the absolute size of the current u , d quark masses ; * enhancement factors associated with the renormalization group treatment of the effective weak hamiltonian ; * use of a relativistic vs. a nonrelativistic quark model ; * the size of the sum rule contribution to pion emission due to su(3 ) breaking ; * the size of the vector meson vs. pion emission amplitudes due to su(6 ) breaking effects ; * _ etc . _",
    "because of all of these unknowns ddh presented their results not as a single number but rather in terms of a _ range _ inside of which it was extremely likely that a given parameter would be found .",
    "in addition they presented a single number called the  best value \" but this is described simply as an educated guess in view of all the uncertainties outlined above .",
    "the results of this process are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".weak nnm couplings as calculated in refs .",
    "all numbers are quoted in units of the  sum rule \" value @xmath54 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     so what is the problem ?",
    "of course , one possibility is that the simple and appealing single meson exchange picture developed above is not appropriate .",
    "however , in view of the success obtained with the corresponding meson - exchange approach to the ordinary nucleon - nucleon potential this seems unlikely .",
    "rather it would seem that the most likely explanation lies in our inability to perform an adequate large basis calculation for nuclear systems .",
    "indeed the inclusion of core polarization effects for the lighter @xmath55f and @xmath55f systems has already been shown to lead to very substantial changes .",
    "likewise recent calculations by horoi and brown have indicated the importance of inclusion of @xmath56 and @xmath57 states in the shell model basis for calculations involving parity violation in p- and s , d - shell nuclei.@xcite",
    "above we have examined the many attempts to understand the phenomenon of nuclear parity violation from the first measurements during the 1950 s until the present day .",
    "we have seen that despite the many and elegant experiments which have been completed and the extensive theoretical effort which has gone into this problem , many difficulties still remain and it is not yet clear that the simple meson exchange picture is able to explain all the varied results . were this to be verified it would be very surprising since a similar single meson exchange picture _ is _ remarkably successful in explaining all aspects of the ordinary nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "nevertheless it remains to be seen . in the mean time",
    ", it is interesting to ask whether say by the end of the decade experiments will be available to aid in this process and/or whether new theoretical work will be able to add new illumination on the mechanism of nuclear parity violation .    in the case of theoretical work , we are somewhat pessimistic . barring some clear breakthrough",
    "it is unlikely that things will change much during this period .",
    "one might think that lattice methods might be of help here , but when one is dealing with three - hadron matrix elements of a four - quark operator , we are still far from being able to make reliable calculations . in the case of non - lattice procedures ,",
    "the only semi - rigorous technique which has yet to be applied consistently to this problem is that of qcd sum rules .",
    "however , again the complex hadron states and four - quark operators make this a severe challenge . one area which deserves",
    "further exploration is the role of strangeness .",
    "recent experiments involving the spin structure of nucleons and neutrino - nucleon scattering have hinted that the nucleon may have a significant strange quark component , which has been neglected in previous calculations of weak nnm couplings .",
    "combined with a new calculation which includes strange quark contributions to the effective weak hamiltonian , one might anticipate a few changes , especially in the pion emission amplitudes .",
    "such calculations are very difficult and at the present time are very speculative .    in the case of experiment",
    ", we are more fortunate , with a number of possible new results coming on line within the next couple of years .",
    "one which has been in the planning stage for many years is a triumf measurement of the asymmetry in longitudinally polarized pp scattering at 240 mev .",
    "the significance of this energy is that according to known phase shifts this is where any effect due to s- and p - wave mixing and thereby a roughly equal contribution from rho and omega exchange effects cancels out , leaving sensitivity primarily to rho exchange contributions in p - d wave interference .",
    "another arena where it is possible that a new experiment could make a major impact is the measurement of parity mixing between the ground state and first excited state of @xmath55ne , which are the isotopic analogs of the mixed states which are studied in the @xmath55f experiments . since both states are isotopic doublets , only the @xmath58 components of @xmath59 are operative , and by combining the results of the ne and f measurements an unambiguous separation of the @xmath26 and @xmath60 components would result .",
    "this could enable an additional and welcome confirmation of the calibration of the pion exchange component , as well as an independent measurement of the size of @xmath61 .    as discussed above",
    ", we expect that continued parity violating electron scattering experiments during the next few years will lead finally to a measurement of the anapole moment and that theoretical work may enable extraction of the nnm couplings in this unique fashion",
    ".    finally , neutron scattering measurements will continue both at los alamos , where studies of heavy nuclei have already indicated the power of statistical methods , as well as at nist where the successful grenoble program will be extended to lighter nuclei , which are hopefully amenable to clearer theoretical interpretation .    in summary",
    "then in both theoretical and experimental areas one sees the need for additional and improved work and we set the challenge that perhaps by the millenium one may finally put this problem to rest .",
