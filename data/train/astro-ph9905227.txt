    "compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons off electrons in ionised intra - cluster gas leads to intensity distortions along the line of sight ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 , 1980 ) . the same scattering mechanism will also change the polarization state of the cmb if the radiation has a quadrupolar anisotropy in the average rest frame of the electrons .",
    "such a quadrupole can arise from several physical effects , including : ( i ) transformation of a primordial quadrupole moment in the frame in which the cmb dipole vanishes ( hereafter referred to as the cmb frame ) ; ( ii ) aberration and doppler effects in the transformation of the non - quadrupole moments of the primordial anisotropy due to electron bulk velocities ; ( iii ) anisotropic scattering in the cluster ; ( iv ) gravitational lensing from dynamic structures .",
    "the first three of these mechanisms were originally studied by sunyaev &  zeldovich  @xcite , while the fourth was considered by gibilisco  .",
    "although the small levels of polarization expected from cluster effects fall below current experimental sensitivities , the prospect of detection with future cmb experiments , such as the _ planck surveyor _ satellite , has fuelled a recent rise in interest in the topic .",
    "audit &  simmons   have ( numerically ) computed the frequency dependence of the polarization arising from the transformation of the cmb monopole for a cold cluster , and itoh , nozawa &  kohyama   derived an analytic expression for the frequency dependence of this polarization mechanism , including the first two corrections arising from thermal effects .",
    "the claims from these two groups that the original results of sunyaev &  zeldovich were in error were met with a paper from sazonov &  sunyaev  , who confirmed the earlier sunyaev  zeldovich analysis , and derived analytic results for the frequency dependence of the polarization arising from the cmb monopole and primordial quadrupole in the limit of a cold electron gas .",
    "sazonov &  sunyaev   also discussed the polarization effect due to prior anisotropic scattering ( which is second - order in the optical depth , @xmath3 ) .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the question of polarization generation from clusters , in the limit where second - order optical depth and gravitational lensing effects can be ignored .",
    "we use a convenient , covariant representation of the linear polarization , which simplifies the geometric interpretation of our results , to derive simple analytic expressions for the frequency dependence of the polarization signal .",
    "our expressions include leading - order thermal and kinematic corrections to the results derived by sazonov & sunyaev  , and confirm their results in the limit of low electron temperatures and bulk velocities .",
    "our results for the thermal corrections to the polarization arising from the electron bulk velocity differ significantly from those given by itoh et al .  .",
    "we show that for typical cluster parameters , the leading - order corrections to the polarization from the primordial quadrupole and the electron bulk velocity amount to reductions in these effects of @xmath2 per cent at the peak of their signals .",
    "these corrections should thus be considered in any future analysis of forthcoming cmb polarization data in the directions of clusters , when such detections are permitted by improvements in receiver sensitivity .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "[ scatter ] we outline our covariant procedure for calculating the scattering term , which appears in the the boltzmann equation , for an unpolarized , but otherwise arbitrary , radiation field in the cmb frame . in section  [ results ] , we present our results for the polarization signal arising from the individual multipoles of the primordial cmb intensity , and discuss their relative importance for a typical cluster .",

    "as with the polarization due to the cmb monopole , we see that the dominant correction to the polarization sourced by the primordial quadrupole is due to thermal effects , and these tend to broaden the signal . in the rayleigh jeans region the size of the fractional correction is the same as for the signal due to the monopole @xmath140 per cent [ compare equations  ( [ eq_monrj ] ) and  ( [ eq_quadrj ] ) ] . near the signal peak ( @xmath191 ) the leading thermal correction leads to a reduction of @xmath192 per cent , but",
    "this is reduced to @xmath193 per cent when the next order thermal correction and the @xmath183 kinematic term are included .",
    "the corrections are most significant in the wien region ; in the @xmath194 _ planck _ hfi channel the thermal terms increase the signal by @xmath195 percent .",
    "however , since the monopole contribution to the degree of polarization rises more rapidly with frequency ( as @xmath156 ) than the quadrupole ( as @xmath155 ) for large @xmath155 , the quadrupole contribution is likely to be less significant than the monopole in the wien region , for typical cluster parameters  @xcite . in the _ planck _ hfi channels at @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath144 , the magnitude of the polarization from the quadrupole as an equivalent fractional temperature change @xmath147 is @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 respectively , which , like the monopole contribution , is well below the predicted sensitivities .",
    "the @xmath57-th multipole of the cmb anisotropy gives rise to a quadrupole of @xmath199 in the rest frame of the scattering electron .",
    "it follows that the leading terms in the signal due to the cmb octupole ( @xmath200 ) will be @xmath201 . unlike the monopole",
    ", the octupole can give a thermal polarization signal even if the cluster peculiar velocity vanishes ( @xmath202 ) , due to the preferred directions in space that it defines .",
    "since the octupole is of similar magnitude to the quadrupole [ the _ cobe _ best - fitting values give @xmath203  @xcite ] , and given that the @xmath204 term in the quadrupole contribution to the polarization can be a sizeable fraction of the total quadrupole signal , the octupole contribution should potentially be included in future attempts to determine the primordial quadrupole at the location of distant ( hot ) clusters via the cluster polarization route  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the polarization due to the cmb octupole follows that of the monopole and quadrupole . for the leading two terms we find @xmath205^{{\\mathrm{tt } } } ( 5-f ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox{}\\hspace{-0.4cm}+ { \\theta_{{\\mathrm{e}}}}[\\tau_{abc}e^c]^{{\\mathrm{tt } } } \\left[6f - \\frac{1}{2}(2f^2+g^2)\\right ] \\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the hexadecapole ( @xmath206 ) the quadrupole in the rest frame of the electron is second - order in @xmath107 , so we might anticipate an @xmath204 polarization signal .",
    "however , to this order the polarization from a beam of electrons with relative velocity @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath207^{{\\mathrm{tt}}}$ ] , which results in a polarization signal proportional to @xmath208^{{\\mathrm{tt}}}$ ] on integrating over the electron distribution . for reasonable values of the cluster peculiar velocity ,",
    "we infer that the effects of the cmb multipoles with @xmath209 can be safely ignored , even for rather hot clusters .",
    "we have presented a direct geometric method for determining the polarization due to the scattering of anisotropic radiation off a thermal distribution of electrons , with non - vanishing bulk velocity , in the limit of low optical depth .",
    "our results for the polarization due to the cmb monopole and quadrupole fully agree with those obtained by sazonov &  sunyaev   [ see also zeldovich &  sunyaev  ] in the low temperature limit .",
    "our results for the thermal corrections to the monopole effect correct those given by itoh et al .  .",
    "a careful inspection of their analysis suggests that the discrepancy arises from the omission of a rotation needed to relate the scattering basis in the rest frame of the initial electron and the cmb frame .",
    "we have shown that for typical cluster parameters the thermal corrections tend to dominate the kinematic corrections .",
    "near the peak of their respective polarization signals , thermal effects tend to reduce the magnitude of the polarization from the monopole and quadrupole by @xmath193 per cent .",
    "the corrections are much larger in the wien part of the spectrum .",
    "we have also noted that the cmb octupole can lead to a polarization signal from hot clusters which is of similar magnitude to the thermal correction to the quadrupole signal .",
    "the effects reported here may be significant for future attempts to determine the cmb quadrupole at distant clusters and the tangential peculiar velocity , to an accuracy of a few per cent , via polarization observations .",
