    "could the standard model of particle physics be fundamentally flawed ? despite its widespread use ,",
    "the model raises conceptual questions of naturalness , is not free of inconsistencies with observations , and includes unproven conjectures . the ever - present assumption that quarks can be treated simultaneously both as free and yet confined is particularly vexing .",
    "it distinguishes the standard model from the rest of science .",
    "such assumptions are best tested in different situations .",
    "similar tests are likely to yield similar results .    here , recently obtained data on high - energy @xmath1 interactions are used to test the model .",
    "hadron production in these interactions provides a new means for testing the model with attractive features .",
    "the initial state is simple , and , according to perturbation theory , the amplitude for the process depends on the squares of the charges of quarks .",
    "it thus depends sensitively on these fundamental parameters , and is also immune to possible cancellations between positive and negative charges .",
    "in addition , initial results from slac and desy were mildly puzzling when compared to predictions of the standard model , thus rendering the process worthy of further investigation@xcite .",
    "recently , the process was studied at lep with electron and positron beam energies of 100 gev .",
    "these studies probed the highest currently available momentum transfers in @xmath1 interactions , and the shortest distances .",
    "they are briefly described below .",
    "the l3 collaboration reported results on @xmath1 interactions in three channels .",
    "data@xcite on inclusive @xmath2 production are shown in fig .",
    "1 . they exceed the prediction of the standard model by about an order of magnitude at the highest transverse momenta .",
    "the @xmath1 interactions occurred in the process @xmath3 where @xmath4 s were radiated by the incoming @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the radiative process was known to be a copious source of @xmath1 interactions@xcite .",
    "observations of @xmath2 production have not been reported by other groups .",
    "however , data on @xmath7 production have been reported by both l3@xcite and opal@xcite .",
    "they are comparable to the @xmath2 data .",
    "both l3 and opal reported significant excesses over the qcd prediction at @xmath8 17 gev / c .",
    "the excess reported by l3 is slightly greater than that shown in fig . 1 for @xmath2 production , whereas for opal the reported excess is slightly less .",
    "data have also been reported by l3@xcite and opal@xcite on inclusive jet production .",
    "the data by l3 extend to higher values of @xmath9 than those of opal , and they show a greater excess over the qcd prediction , reaching nearly an order of magnitude at 45 gev / c .      the @xmath1 data were derived from @xmath10 interactions in which the incoming @xmath5 and @xmath6 radiated nearly real @xmath4 s that interacted , and in which the outgoing @xmath5 and @xmath6 emerged in the beam pipe of the collider and went undetected .",
    "@xmath1 events were identified through calorimetric measurements of the total energy of detected outgoing particles .",
    "this was significantly @xmath11 gev for @xmath1 events .",
    "one source of background arose from @xmath10 annihilation in which the final state energy was mismeasured .",
    "the main source of background arose , however , from @xmath12 where initial state radiation reduced the invariant mass of the @xmath10 system to that of the z , and in which the @xmath4 emerged in the beam pipe and was undetected .",
    "hadronic decays of the z in these events could mimic @xmath1 events .",
    "however , z s produced as above are boosted to an energy of @xmath13 gev .",
    "both l3 and opal made cuts on the total energy measured in their calorimeters to remove this source of background .",
    "the high - precision calorimeters employed by l3 enabled them to place the cut at 80 gev and maintain the background below @xmath14 . in the case of opal ,",
    "the cut had to be placed at a lower level , and/or extra conditions applied , resulting in analyses of greater complexity .",
    "the increasing nature of the above discrepancies between theory and observation is indicative of new substructure being uncovered in @xmath1 interactions . from a purely observational point - of - view , and irrespective of any theoretical prejudice , the results call for testing at higher energies and higher momentum transfers .",
    "there are at least two ways in which such tests could be accomplished .",
    "two @xmath10 linear colliders were proposed in recent years , the ilc and clic .",
    "the ilc was planned to reach collision energies of @xmath15 tev .",
    "although these would not greatly exceed the 0.2 tev collison energy of lep , the ilc would offer a distinct advantage .",
    "this would be the option to accelerate @xmath5 s in both arms of the collider , and thereby eliminate entirely the two main sources of background , described above , that occurred in the @xmath1 experiments at lep . in this way",
    ", momentum transfers up to the full kinematic limit of the collider could be reached .",
    "unfortunately , however , funding opportunities for the ilc appear bleak@xcite .",
    "the second linear collider that has been proposed , @xmath0 clic , is planned to reach collision energies from 0.2 to 5.0 tev .",
    "clic could also be run in the @xmath16 mode , but it is still at the research and development stage@xcite .",
    "an alternative procedure for reaching high collision energies in @xmath1 interactions has emerged in recent years with encouraging features .",
    "this is the `` plasma wakefield '' technique in which intense electric fields are generated by a particle or laser pulse propagating through vapour , and used to accelerate charged particles .",
    "the drive pulse ionises the vapour , leaving a positive ion beam along its track .",
    "the freed electrons are attracted back to the positive ion beam and , in so doing , generate a zig - zag wake with intense electric fields at the crossing points .",
    "these fields are used to accelerate particles . in a dramatic demonstration ,",
    "42 gev electrons passing through lithium vapour were accelerated to energies up to 85 gev in just 80-cm@xcite .",
    "two multistage electron accelerators based on this principal might generate @xmath1 collisions at tev energies for considerably less expense than the ilc and clic designs described above@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 results from lep are significant . according to the standard model , the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 applies@xcite when @xmath17 few gev / c .",
    "the amplitude for hadron production at large transverse momenta was therefore predicted to be proportional to the sum of the squares of the charges of quarks accessible at 200 gev , and the cross section was expected to provide a simple but sensitive constraint on these basic charges@xcite .",
    "the data , however , are inconsistent with this expectation , on two counts .",
    "not only do the data exceed the predictions in all channels , but the excesses in each channel grow with transverse momentum . quite generally , one might expect quarks with larger charges than the fractional values normally assumed to explain the first of these discrepancies , and the existence of substructure of some kind to explain the second .",
    "ferreira considered a han - nambu type of model with quarks having unit charges , and he found improved agreement with the data@xcite .",
    "however , the model did not include substructure of any form , and , as expected , the dependence of the data on transverse momentum was not well explained .",
    "ferreira also provided a comprehensive review of the literature on quarks of unit charge .      before qcd was proposed , two theories of highly charged quarks were proposed , independently . in one ,",
    "quarks were proposed by schwinger@xcite to be magnetic monopoles , in the other they were proposed@xcite to be highly electrically charged particles . in both cases , it was assumed that strong electromagnetic forces between quarks of opposite polarity accounted for quark binding , and that strong nuclear interactions between composite states occurred as residual interactions .",
    "both theories were based on eigenvalue equations for charge . in ref .",
    "14 a modified version of dirac s eigenvalue equation for magnetic charge was assumed .",
    "this predicts a large value for the electric dipole moment of the neutron , exceeding by several orders of magnitude the measured upper limit . in ref .",
    "15 a physical solution to a gell - mann - low equation was assumed which required strong electromagnetic interactions , i.e. an `` electro - strong '' model .",
    "this is summarised below .",
    "the guiding principle in the formulation of the electro - strong model was the assumption that the correct theory is finite without renormalization . in this",
    "regard we note that neither feynman nor dirac accepted the validity of conventional renormalization theory .",
    "conventional quantum electrodynamics , characterized by the lagrangian    @xmath18    may satisfy the finiteness criterion if the bare mass of the electron vanishes , and if the bare charge of the electron satisfies an eigenvalue equation of the form@xcite    @xmath19    here @xmath20 denotes the 4th + higher - order contributions to @xmath21 , normalised by the 2nd order contribution , and @xmath22 . a perturbative expansion of @xmath20 yields    @xmath23    which is unlikely to be consistent with eq . ( 2 ) if @xmath24 .    in ref",
    "( 16 ) a sequence of models was considered in an effort to avoid this impasse .",
    "the first was a model with strong interactions included following then - recent papers by fermi and yang@xcite , lee and yang@xcite , sakurai@xcite , neeman@xcite and schwinger@xcite .",
    "a vector field @xmath25 was introduced and coupled strongly to the proton current as below    @xmath26    where it was implicitily .",
    "] assumed that @xmath27 .",
    "with such a theory , eq .",
    "( 2 ) was found@xcite to bifurcate into a pair of conditions    @xmath28    that could not be simultaneously met .",
    "this motivated consideration of a unified gauge theory with the electromagnetic field @xmath29 coupled electromagnetically to the electron , and strongly coupled to a `` pseudo - proton '' , as below    @xmath30    this resulted in a single condition for finiteness    @xmath31    which probably could be met , but an unrealistic theory in which the `` pseudo - proton '' was highly charged , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "it was then but a small step to introduce the then - new quark concept by replacing the `` pseudo - proton '' field in eq .",
    "( 6 ) with a pair of quark fields , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with bare charges @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , as below    @xmath37    where    @xmath38    the theory defined by eq .",
    "( 8) includes both electromagnetic and strong interactions that are transmitted by the single vector field @xmath39 .",
    "it this unifies strong and electromagnetic interactions , hence the terminology `` electro - strong '' model .",
    "besides unifying strong and electromagnetic interactions , the model has other unusual features .",
    "these are discussed below .",
    "an obvious feature of the electro - strong model is the inbuilt mechanism it possesses for quark binding , @xmath0 , the strong attraction between highly charged quarks of opposite polarity that would be expected to form states that are neutral with respect to the high charge@xcite .",
    "this assumption of neutrality is analogous to the corresponding assumption that was made a few years later in qcd with respect to color charge@xcite .",
    "the above mechanism for quark binding suggests the following particle classification for the model defined by eq .",
    "( 8):-    @xmath40    and @xmath41    the spins and parities of the quark - antiquark states follow as in any fermion - antifermion model .",
    "the @xmath42 states would have different masses and interaction strengths from the @xmath43 states because of the different charges involved .",
    "symmetry breaking in this sense is thus inbuilt in the model , without the introduction of a higgs mechanism .",
    "also , the presence of multiple generations ( two in the above model ) is required to form fermionic bound states such as the proton .",
    "this contrasts with the standard model where the presence of multiple generations is unexplained@xcite . for the proton state ,",
    "antisymmetry of the @xmath44 state requires this pair to be in the singlet spin state , which leads to a prediction of @xmath45 for the proton without the introduction of color .",
    "the proton s magnetic moment would be expected to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the physical mass of the q. for @xmath48 and @xmath49 this ratio could be @xmath50 , suggesting that quarks may be heavy and tightly bound , as may have been originally supposed@xcite .",
    "this suggests a small separation between quarks in bound states , and a generalized yukawa model for hadrons@xcite , as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "3 .    bare mesons and nucleons would act as partons processes at slac or similar energies ] of unit charge in the generalized yukawa model at non - asymptotic energies , without invoking the unexplained final state interactions of the standard model that allow fractionaly charged quarks to convert ( or `` hadronize '' ) to integrally charged hadrons@xcite .",
    "however , the eventual onset of large electromagnetic effects at asymptotically high energies and high transervse momenta would be expected .",
    "these effects could make their first appearance in @xmath1 interactions because these interactions are sensitive to the square of the charge of the quark , as discussed above .",
    "the growing discrepancy shown in fig . 1 between the standard model and @xmath1 data with increasing transverse momentum may be signaling the onset of these effects .",
    "further studies of @xmath1 interactions at higher energies and higher transverse momenta are called for .",
    "the apparent ease with which the electro - strong model appears potentially able to explain a number of phenomena , from divergences in quantum field theory , to quark statistics , quark binding , symmetry breaking , multiple generations , hadronization and , last but not least , the @xmath1 data raises an obvious question , can the model reproduce the particle spectrum of the standard model ?",
    "the answer , in the opinion of this author , is not positive@xcite .",
    "although a qualitatively similar particle spectrum is possible , it is distinct .",
    "the difference arises from the different natures of strong interactions in the two models . in the electro - strong model ,",
    "they are abelian gauge interactions , in the standard model they are non - abelian gauge interactions .",
    "the former require multiple generations of particles , and they include inbuilt symmetry breaking .",
    "the latter do not require multiple generations , and they require symmetry breaking to be added .",
    "searches for the higgs particle are therefore relevant .",
    "recent results from fermilab on unexpected muons in @xmath51 events are also relevant@xcite .",
    "the vertices of the unexpected muons are not coincident with @xmath52 interaction sites , indicating that the muons are decay products of long - lived , weakly - decaying particles . if so , the weakly - decaying particles apparently lie outside the particle spectrum of the standard model@xcite .",
    "we note here that @xmath51 production was also studied at cern in @xmath1 interactions .",
    "the results are comparable to those reported at fermilab .",
    "the l3 group reported an excess of events over expectation which the aleph group attributed to secondaries not arising from the @xmath1 interaction sites@xcite .",
    "the similarity of the independently obtained results from fermilab and cern lends support to both datasets , and to the existence of particles lying outside the particle spectrum of the standard model . a new @xmath1 collider",
    "as proposed above could test this possibility .",
    "published data from cern on @xmath1 interactions at high energies are inconsistent with the current standard model of particle physics .",
    "the data exceed the predictions by about an order of magnitude in each of three channels .",
    "the discrepancies are greatest at the highest observed transverse momenta , and show no sign of decreasing , or even of levelling off , with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "the results question the fractional charges assumed for quarks in the standard model , and suggest the existence of new substructure in hadrons that was not previously detected . either the data are badly incorrect , or the standard model is seriously flawed .",
    "irrespective of any theoretical prejudice , the data call for independent testing , preferably at higher energies and higher transverse momenta . such testing could be carried with either of the linear colliders ( ilc or clic ) that have been proposed , but an electron - electron collider based on the plasma wakefield acceleration technique could provide the most affordable option .    the @xmath1 data may be compared to rutherford s old data on @xmath53-particle scattering by gold foil@xcite .",
    "although the physics underlying the @xmath53-particle and @xmath1 interactions is undoubtedly different , there may be a connection .",
    "both cross - sections fall through several orders of magnitude with increasing transverse momentum , but in both cases the fall is gentler than was generally anticipated .",
    "it was , of course , rutherford s experiment that supplanted j. j. thomson s `` plumb - pudding '' model of the atom in which low - mass electrons swarmed in a cloud of massless , positive charge .",
    "it may be more than coincidental that the thomson model bears resemblance to today s standard model of the nucleon in which low - mass quarks swarm in a cloud of massless colour charge@xcite .",
    "the electro - strong model appears able to accommodate the @xmath1 results , at least qualitatively .",
    "it provides motivation for the construction of a new , high - energy @xmath1 collider of either conventional design , or using the plasma wakefield technique .",
    "this would follow the long - held viewpoint that the search for large electromagnetic effects at high energies provides the most reliable means for testing the electro - strong model@xcite .    in recent years",
    "the author became involved in the search for habitable planets orbiting stars in the galaxy@xcite .",
    "this led naturally to thoughts on physics that might be underway on such `` exoplanets '' .",
    "others had similar thoughts .",
    "gell - mann expressed the opinion that the standard model would likely be under scrutiny@xcite .",
    "more recently , rees@xcite supported the case for strings . in the spirit _ ] of poincar@xmath54",
    ", this author feels that simpler or more beautiful theories might yet be possible .",
    "hopefully we need not wait to receive a blueprint from `` out there '' on the fundamental constituents of matter to decide the issue !",
