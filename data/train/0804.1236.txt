    "magnetic shape - memory alloys have drawn much attention in recent years owing to their unique magnetomechanical properties such as magnetic shape - memory @xcite and the magnetic superelasticity @xcite .",
    "these properties are a consequence of a strong coupling between magnetic and structural degrees of freedom . the prototypical and first discovered magnetic shape - memory material is the heusler ni@xmath1mnga @xcite .",
    "this alloy undergoes a complex multi - stage transformation process from a high temperature paramagnetic cubic phase to a ferromagnetic martensitic phase . at intermediate temperatures",
    "it shows precursor tweed textures which may lock ( via a first - order phase transition ) into a modulated premartensitic structure due to the freezing of a specific phonon with a given wave vector .",
    "this behavior appears to be related to low resistance against distortions of the @xmath2 planes along the @xmath3 directions and is evidenced by the features of the low energy ta@xmath1 acoustic phonon branch @xcite and the low value of the elastic constant @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "while these features are essentially inherent to the high - temperature cubic structure , additional softening has been shown to arise from the coupling between structural and magnetic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "thus , it has been suggested that the magnetostructural coupling is responsible for the phonon condensation yielding the intermediate modulated structure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the occurrence of a premartensitic phase is not yet a well understood phenomenon , as it only has been observed for a restricted number of magnetic shape memory alloys within limited composition ranges .",
    "actually , the study of the structural ( martensitic and premartensitic transformations ) and magnetic properties of ni - mn - ga alloys is a current topic of intense research @xcite .",
    "the effect of doping elements on the martensitic and magnetic transformations in ni - mn - ga alloys has received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of a systematic study makes it difficult to compare directly the properties of different compounds . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the dependence of transition temperatures ( martensitic , intermediate and curie ) on the electron concentration by analyzing the effect of substituting ni , mn and ga by fe . in all cases ,",
    "the reference system is the stoichiometric ni@xmath1mnga , which has a high temperature l2@xmath5 structure ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "the strength of such an interaction depends on the magnetization .",

    "this requires that the martensitic transition temperature is well below @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the temperature that corresponds to the point where martensitic and premartensitic transformation temperatures meet is slightly displaced to higher @xmath0 values in the case of ni - mn - ga - fe system with respect to the ternary system .",

    "this scenario is consistent with the experimental finding that the premartensitic phase only develops for ferromagnetically ordered samples for which the martensitic instability is well below @xmath54 .",

    "we have studied the effect of fe addition on the structural and magnetic transformation properties in the magnetic shape memory alloy ni - mn - ga for compositions close to stoichiometry .",
