    "the classical sturm - liouville problem ( slp ) consists of a linear second - order ordinary differential equation written in formally self - adjoint form @xmath0 defined over an interval @xmath1 with appropriate boundary conditions at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "eigenvalue _ is a value of @xmath4 for which has a nontrivial solution @xmath5 subject to the boundary conditions , and the solution , unique up to scalar multiples , is the associated _",
    "eigenfunction_.    the _ regular _ theory which dates back to sturm ( 1809 - 1882 ) and liouville ( 1803 - 1855 ) assumes that the coefficient functions are well - behaved , say @xmath6 and @xmath7 are piecewise continuous with @xmath8 and @xmath9 strictly positive , on a bounded closed interval @xmath10 $ ] , and that regular boundary conditions are imposed , namely @xmath11 where @xmath12 are not both zero , nor are @xmath13 .",
    "then there is an infinite sequence of eigenvalues @xmath14 and eigenfunctions @xmath15 such that @xmath16 has just @xmath17 zeros on the open interval @xmath18 , and such that distinct eigenfunctions are orhogonal with respect to the weight @xmath7 : @xmath19    the mathematical theory of slps is immense ( see e.g. @xcite ) but they are not just objects of interest to mathematicians alone . since the early 19th century slps have been ubiquitous in applied mathematics since they are the one - dimensional models of a large number of important physical processes in fields such as acoustics , geophysics , waveguide theory , hydrodynamic stability , neutron transport ,  . they arise in the analysis of such processes in more than one dimension by the method of separation of variables .",
    "another reason why slps are of vital interest to physicists is that schrdinger s equation in one dimension is of sturm - liouville form .",
    "some eigenvalue problems have explicit solutions , and are therefore important in the analytical investigation of different physical models .",
    "however most eigenvalue problems are not solvable , and computationally efficient approximation techniques are of great applicability .",
    "the numerical solution of ( regular ) sturm - liouville problems is not trivial .",
    "the choice of numerical method for efficiently approximating a sequence of eigenvalues of the slp depends on the desired accuracy of the estimates and also upon the number of eigenvalues required .",
    "general ode boundary - value software can solve slps , but inefficiently .",
    "the challenges are to do this more cheaply , especially when long runs of higher - order eigenvalues are required .",
    "+ in fact , many classical methods involve the approximation of the corresponding eigenfunctions by piecewise polynomials and are thus inefficient for the computation of higher eigenvalues which have severely oscillatory eigenfunctions .",
    "there have e.g.  been many developments in the basic approach of reduction to a matrix eigenproblem using finite differences and finite elements .",
    "excellent surveys of such matrix methods are given in @xcite .",
    "matrix methods can only be used to approximate the first few eigenvalues . the error for even moderately large @xmath17 is considerable unless the dimension of the associated matrix is very large . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on a different class of methods which are based on shooting - type algorithms .",
    "these methods perform much better than the matrix methods for singular ( or nearly singular ) problems , for the computation of eigenfunctions , and even for the highly accurate computation of the first eigenvalues .",
    "we will discuss in particular some important contributions to the efficient and accurate computation of the higher eigenvalues of slps .",
    "shooting methods are based on the reduction of the boundary value problem - to the solution of an initial value problem .",
    "the differential equation is solved as an initial value problem over the range @xmath10 $ ] for a succession of trial values of @xmath4 which are adjusted till the boundary conditions at both ends can be satisfied at once , at which point we have an eigenvalue .",
    "the simplest technique is to ` shoot ' from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "this means that one chooses initial conditions which satisfy the boundary condition in @xmath2 : @xmath20 the boundary condition at @xmath3 determines ` target ' values ; if the value of @xmath5 matches the target , we have found an eigenvalue .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues are determined , using some iterative technique , as the solution of @xmath21 another option is to shoot from the two ends to some _ matching point _",
    "@xmath22 . in this case",
    "also a right - hand solution @xmath23 is defined satisfying the conditions @xmath24 the two solutions @xmath25 and @xmath23 are arbitrarily normalised , so their values can always be made to agree at the matching point by renormalising them . however , the criterion for a trial value of @xmath4 to be an eigenvalue is that the first derivatives should match , as well as te values .",
    "the _ mismatch function _ ( also called miss - distance ) is thus given by @xmath26 numerically some choices of @xmath27 may make it more difficult to compute @xmath28 than do others ( see @xcite ) .",
    "generally it is a good idea to take the matching point in the interior of the interval , away from singular endpoints .",
    "thus the procedure for finding the numerical value of an eigenvalue , consists in evaluating the mismatch function @xmath28 , numerically , and then through a finite series of iterations finding the value of @xmath4 such that @xmath29 to the required accuracy .",
    "the usual iterative methods for finding the roots of a function may be employed here to find the zeros of @xmath28 .",
    "one problem associated with this approach is that the function @xmath28 does not give any way of determining the index of the eigenvalue once it has been found .",
    "thus we have no way of knowing which eigenvalue we have found when @xmath29 .",
    "likewise , in order to converge on a specific eigenfunction , one has to enhance the algorithm , for instance by counting the zeros of the solution as part of the integration for each trial @xmath4 value .    to solve this problem , the polar coordinate substitution , known as the prfer transformation ,",
    "this transformation makes it possible to specify the eigenvalue to be computed .",
    "the ( scaled ) prfer transformation is defined by the equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a strictly positive ` scaling function ' chosen to give good numerical behaviour . in @xcite",
    "it shown that the resulting differential equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 are then of the form @xmath34 the regular boundary conditions at @xmath2 and @xmath3 define the conditions for @xmath33 @xmath35 where @xmath36 these equations only determine @xmath37 and @xmath38 up to a multiple of @xmath39 . as stated by the following theorem ( proved in @xcite ) , each ( appropriate ) choice of this multiple specifies in fact precisely one eigenvalue .",
    "[ theoremth]consider the scaled prfer equations of a regular sturm - liouville problem .",
    "let the boundary values @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfy the following normalization : @xmath40.\\ ] ] then the @xmath17th eigenvalue is the value of @xmath4 giving a solution of satisfying @xmath41    this leads to several useful numerical methods based on some form of the prfer transformation .",
    "prfer based shooting methods can be constructed where the counting of the zeros of @xmath42 needed to compute the specific eigenvalue with a given index @xmath17 is built in .",
    "one can for instance define a shooting method for the @xmath33 equation : for any @xmath4 , let @xmath43 and @xmath44 then be the solutions of satisfying @xmath45.\\ ] ] the scaled prfer mismatch function is then defined by @xmath46 and the eigenvalue @xmath47 is the unique value such that @xmath48 .    the sleign code ( and its successor sleign2 ) from sandia laboratories @xcite uses an ( explicit ) runge - kutta method to integrate the @xmath33 equation . for certain problems , where a good scaling function @xmath31 is heuristically found ,",
    "the oscillations are removed and large steps can be taken . however there is no general method for finding a good scaling function and such shooting methods based on standard initial value libraries often suffer from stepsize restriction when solving for large eigenvalues .",
    "they also have some difficulties caused by stiffness of the @xmath33 equation in a ` barrier ' region where @xmath49 is large and negative . instead of using a standard initial value library code ,",
    "it is a better idea to combine a prfer formulation with coefficient approximation , in which the coefficient functions are piecewisely approximated by low degree polynomials .",
    "then the integrations may be performed analytically and stiffness is no longer a problem .",
    "an important class of methods for the numerical solution of sturm - liouville problems is based on coefficient approximation .",
    "the basic idea here is to replace the coefficient functions @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath7 of the sturm - liouville equation piecewisely by low degree polynomials so that the resulting equation can be solved analytically .",
    "the idea dates back at least to gordon @xcite and canosa and de oliveira @xcite and was studied also by ixaru @xcite , paine and de hoog @xcite and smooke @xcite .",
    "but the standard reference is due to pruess @xcite .",
    "he examined the piecewise constant case and his strategy has been implemented by pruess and fulton in the code sledge @xcite .",
    "this so - called pruess method replaces the slp by the approximating problem @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are piecewise constant ( midpoint ) approximations of the functions @xmath55 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath56 of the approximating problem can then be integrated explicitly in terms of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions : let @xmath8 , @xmath57 and @xmath9 have constant values @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 in the @xmath61th interval @xmath62 with step size @xmath63 : @xmath64 the solution over @xmath65 $ ] is then advanced by the relation @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 \\displaystyle \\cosh(z^{1/2 } ) & { \\rm\\ if\\ } z > 0\\ , , \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\quad \\eta_0(z ) = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\displaystyle \\sin(|z|^{1/2})/|z|^{1/2 } & { \\rm\\ if\\ } z",
    "< 0\\,,\\\\[.2 cm ] \\displaystyle 1 & { \\rm\\ if\\ } z=0\\,,\\\\[.2 cm ] \\displaystyle \\sinh(z^{1/2})/z^{1/2 } & { \\rm\\ if\\ } z > 0\\ , , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{a2}\\ ] ] one can also propagate the solution from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , by taking the inverse of the transfer matrix in , which is just the result of replacing @xmath71 by @xmath72 in this matrix .",
    "+ this gives us a method for explicitly integrating @xmath73 over the @xmath74 range , and to use a shooting method .",
    "this is done e.g. in sledge and combined with the ideas based on the prfer substitution to be able to home in on a particular eigenvalue ( see @xcite ) .",
    "pruess proved that if @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath54 are piecewise constant on a mesh of typical meshsize @xmath77 and equal to @xmath8 , @xmath57 , and @xmath9 at the mesh midpoints and if @xmath78 is the @xmath17th eigenvalue of the approximating problem , then @xmath79 for all @xmath17 and small enough @xmath77 . thus one would expect a higher eigenvalue to need more meshpoints to compute to a given relative tolerance than a lower eigenvalue .",
    "however , as mentioned in @xcite , there are two reasons why this is not seen in practice .",
    "firstly , arguments show also that @xmath80 for large @xmath17 and small enough @xmath77 . secondly , many problems occur in liouville normal form ( schrdinger form ) where @xmath81 and for these there is an improved error bound @xmath82 thus we can actually use larger @xmath77 for large @xmath17 for a given relative error .",
    "the pruess - type methods have some important advantages .",
    "as already noted , pruess methods are relatively unaffected by the stiffness / instability which can force a very small stepsize on a standard initial - value solver , and the accuracy is maintained ( or even improved ) as @xmath83 .",
    "further advantages of the pruess methods are that it allows a very simple interval truncation algorithm for singular problems ( see section [ secsing ] ) and that unlike a method based on a standard initial - value solver , it is practical with the pruess method to fix the mesh and evaluate the coefficient midpoint values once for all before the start of the shooting process",
    ". since the overall shooting process consists of a number of integrations with different values of @xmath4 the latter can give a big speed advantage .",
    "a drawback of the pruess methods is the difficulty in obtaining higher order methods .",
    "it is usual to implement them using richardson extrapolation .",
    "it is clear that the step sizes must be sufficiently small such that the error introduced by the approximation by piecewise constants is not too large .",
    "this means that for problems with strongly varying coefficient functions the number of intervals in a mesh can be quite large .",
    "some approaches have been suggested towards the realization of higher order methods based on coefficient approximation .",
    "these approaches can be classified as `` modified integral series methods '' , which will be discussed next .",
    "we will consider two integral series which allow the natural extension of the pruess - ideas to higher order methods : a neumann series and a magnus series .",
    "in fact , these integral series offer an easy way to approximate the coefficient functions of the slp by higher order ( piecewise ) polynomials , giving more accurate results than the approximation by a piecewise constant .",
    "there is an emerging family of numerical methods based on integral series representation of ode solutions .",
    "consider the linear differential equation @xmath84 the simplest integral series is obtained by applying picard iteration @xcite to obtain the fundamental solution of the matrix linear ode @xmath85{\\bf y}_0\\end{split}\\ ] ] this series is known as the feynman - dyson path ordered exponential in quantum mechanics , in mathematics it is known as the _ neumann _ series or peano series .",
    "the magnus and cayley expansions are two other examples .",
    "they are obtained by transforming eq .   to the suitable lie algebra and applying the picard iteration to the transformed ode .",
    "details on both approaches can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cayley expansion is based on the cayley transform while the magnus expansion is based on the exponential map .",
    "the approach of magnus @xcite aims at writing the solution of eq .   as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a suitable matrix .",
    "magnus expansion _ says that @xmath88d{x_1 } \\\\&+\\frac{1}{4}\\int_0^x\\left[\\int_0^{x_1}\\left[\\int_0^{x_2}a(x_3)dx_3,a(x_2)\\right]dx_2,a(x_1)\\right]d{x_1 } \\\\&+\\frac{1}{12}\\int_0^x\\left[\\int_0^{x_1 } a(x_2)dx_2,\\left[\\int_0^{x_1 } a(x_3)dx_3,a(x_1)\\right]\\right]d{x_1}+\\dots \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 $ ] denotes the matrix commutator defined by @xmath90=xy - yx$ ] .",
    "numerical schemes based on the magnus expansion received a lot of attention due to their preservation of lie group symmetries ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the neumann series does not respect lie group structure but avoids the use of the matrix exponential .",
    "the use of neumann series integrators has been proved successfull for certain large , highly oscillatory systems in @xcite .",
    "since the slp can be written in the matrix form , both neumann and magnus schemes can be considered for the numerical solution of the slp .",
    "the sturm - liouville equation in matrix form reads @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "moan @xcite was the first to consider a magnus series integrator for the slp in the schrdinger form @xmath93 or in matrix form @xmath94 he applied the magnus integrator directly to this problem .",
    "however poor approximations were obtained for the higher eigenvalues , as a result of the finite radius of convergence of the magnus series @xcite .",
    "when the solution of a linear system @xmath95 oscillates rapidly , modified schemes should be used , as recommended in @xcite . describing these modified schemes",
    "we will focus on the basic schrdinger equation @xmath93 , but the schemes can be extended to the more general sturm - liouville problem @xmath96 .",
    "we consider the sturm - liouville problem in schrdinger form eq .   which is a problem of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98^{t}$ ] .",
    "note that the coefficient matrix is in @xmath99,i.e .",
    "the matrix has a zero trace .",
    "suppose that we have already computed @xmath100 and that we wish to advance the numerical solution to @xmath101 .",
    "we first compute a constant approximation @xmath76 of the potential function @xmath51 @xmath102 next we change the frame of reference by letting @xmath103 where @xmath104 we treat @xmath105 as our new unknown which itself obeys the linear differential equation @xmath106,\\quad { \\bf u}(0)={\\bf y}_{i-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 the matrix @xmath108 can be computed explicitly . with @xmath109 and @xmath110 defined as in eq .",
    "we can write @xmath108 as @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we have thus replaced one linear system by another .",
    "the new system has one crucial advantage over : the entries of the matrix @xmath108 are themselves rapidly oscillating functions ( for @xmath114 ) .",
    "this is not very helpful when is solved by a classical method as e.g.  a runge - kutta or multistep method . when the modified equation is however solved by an integral series method , repeated evaluation of integrals of @xmath108 is required .",
    "this integration is a `` smoothing '' operator : the amplitude is decreased once the integrand is integrated . as a result",
    "the higher the oscillation , the faster the convergence of the integral series method and the faster the decay in local error .",
    "we can refer to @xcite for numerical results confirming the success of this approach for highly oscillatory odes .    over each interval @xmath115 $ ] an integral series is applied on the transformed equation @xmath116 .",
    "this requires the truncation of the integral series and the replacement of integrals by quadrature ( see next section ) .",
    "the solution @xmath117 in @xmath118 is then obtained from @xmath119 . note that @xmath120 is the known solution of the system with constant potential @xmath121 and thus the same as the transfer matrix in .",
    "the first option we consider is the use of a neumann scheme .",
    "application of the neumann series integrator to the modified equation @xmath116 gives @xmath122{\\bf y}_{i-1}\\end{split}\\ ] ] when only the first term in the neumann series is retained , one has @xmath123 and with @xmath124 this is exactly the second - order pruess method given by eq .  .",
    "higher order methods are obtained by including more neumann terms .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in fact each extra neumann term can be seen as a correction term in a piecewise constant perturbation method ( ppm ) of ixaru and co - workers .",
    "the ppms use a perturbation technique ( the first systematic description of this technique is due to ixaru @xcite ) to construct some correction terms which are added to the known solution of the approximating problem @xmath125 with a piecewise constant potential @xmath76 .",
    "the more correction terms included the higher the order of the algorithm . in @xcite",
    "the ppm algorithm is described and applied on regular schrdinger problems .",
    "the ppms were also extended to general sturm - liouville problems using the liouville transform and formed the basis of the fortran code slcpm12 @xcite and the graphical matlab software package matslise @xcite .",
    "+ to approximate the integrals in quadrature must be used which can deal adequately with the oscillatory entries of the matrix function @xmath108 . in section [ filonsection ]",
    "a filon - type quadrature rule will be discussed which is very similar to the procedure used in the description of high order ppms in @xcite . there",
    "the potential function @xmath57 is replaced by a piecewise polynomial , which makes the integrals in analytically solvable .",
    "the degree of the ( piecewise ) polynomial can be taken sufficiently large such that this approximation has no influence on the accuracy of the method .",
    "the order of the method then only depends on the number of terms retained in the neumann expansion ( i.e.  ppm correction terms ) . as mentioned , including only the first neumann term gives us a method of order two .",
    "including also the second neumann term ( the first integral ) leads to a method of order four , adding the third term ( the double integral ) results in an eighth order method and adding the fourth term gives us a method of order ten ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another option is to apply a magnus method to the modified equation .",
    "the magnus expansion is then @xmath126 where @xmath127dx_2d{x_1},\\\\ \\nonumber \\sigma_3(\\delta)&=&\\frac{1}{12}\\int_0^\\delta\\left[\\int_0^{x_1}b(x_2)dx_2,\\left[\\int_0^{x_1}b(x_2)dx_2,b(x_1)\\right]\\right]d{x_1},\\\\ \\sigma_4(\\delta)&=&\\frac{1}{4}\\int_0^\\delta\\left[\\int_0^{x_1}\\left[\\int_0^{x_2}b(x_3)dx_3,b(x_2)\\right]dx_2,b(x_1)\\right]d{x_1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath128 .",
    "thus , to compute @xmath129 with @xmath130 , we need to approximate @xmath131 by truncating the expansion and replacing integrals by quadrature ( see [ filonsection ] ) . as shown in @xcite , truncating all but the first integral leads to a fourth order method , while including also @xmath132 gives us a scheme of order eight .",
    "having approximated @xmath131 , its @xmath133 matrix exponential must be computed .",
    "we note that @xmath134 is always a two by two matrix with zero trace . for such matrices",
    "the following is true : @xmath135 here @xmath136 are functions of @xmath74 and @xmath137 .",
    "practical implementation of both the neumann and magnus series requires the replacement of multivariate integrals by quadrature .",
    "although multivariate quadrature is usually considered a hard problem , it is possible to implement neumann and magnus expansions with surprisingly cheap and effective quadrature .",
    "moreover when a filon - type quadrature method is used , even the highly oscillating integrals , which appear when @xmath138 , are approximated to a suitable precision in a small number of function evaluations per step .",
    "filon quadrature has been analysed extensively in @xcite .    for a neumann integrator as well as for a magnus integrator , the univariate ( modified ) integral @xmath139 needs to be approximated .",
    "a filon - type rule is used . here",
    "this means that @xmath140 in is replaced by a polynomial , i.e.  by the lagrange polynomial @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the @xmath143th cardinal polynomial of lagrangian interpolation and @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146,@xmath147 are distinct quadrature nodes .",
    "the resulting integrals can then be solved analytically . for each entry in the univariate integral a scheme of the following form results @xmath148",
    "when no further neumann or magnus terms are retained in the algorithm , the truncated neumann or magnus scheme is of order four and it is then sufficient to have @xmath149 legendre quadrature nodes ( or @xmath150 lobatto nodes ) .",
    "this means thus that in this case @xmath151 is approximated by a linear polynomial .",
    "+ for schemes of order eight , the double integral must be included and @xmath152 legendre nodes should be used . as for the univariate integral , the double integral",
    "is computed by replacing @xmath153 by the polynomial @xmath154 and solving the resulting integrals analytically ( using a symbolic software package ) .",
    "each entry in the double integral is then approximated by an expression of the form @xmath155 where the values of @xmath151 that have been already evaluated for the quadrature of the univariate integral are reused . for triple and further integrals",
    "the same procedure can be applied : replace @xmath151 by the lagrange polynomial of sufficiently high degree and then use the resulting analytic expressions for the integrals as approximating formulae .",
    "note that also the value of @xmath76 in is computed by gauss - legendre with @xmath156 nodes , and thus the same function evaluations of @xmath51 are needed as to compute the different @xmath157 in the lagrange polynomial .    an alternative way to apply",

    "even higher order algorithms can be constructed including more magnus ( or neumann ) terms in the scheme . in @xcite a magnus scheme of order 10 is described where @xmath181 and in @xcite ppm - schemes up to order 16 are presented .",

    "this classification information is important to determine whether or not there is a continuous spectrum , when there are eigenvalues and how many , and what boundary condition should be imposed at a singular endpoint .",
    "as mentioned before , the algorithm applied in the sledge package relies on pruess coefficient approximation by piecewise constants ( namely the midpoint values of each interval ) , and uses repeated extrapolation to achieve accuracy .",
    "in a first pass a crude initial mesh is chosen by an equidistribution process .",
    "sledge then repeatedly bisects this initial mesh and uses iterated extrapolation .",
    "an infinite endpoint is transformed to zero by the ( local ) change of variable @xmath196 , and subsequent bisections near the endpoint are done in terms of the variable @xmath197 .",
    "sledge s approach automatically regularizes singular endpoints : evaluating the coefficients at the mesh midpoints can be regarded as truncating the interval at the midpoints of the first and final intervals of the mesh .",
    "every time the mesh is bisected these implicit truncation points move closer to the singular endpoints .",
    "the boundary conditions are always applied in the original endpoints .    for the higher order coefficient approximation methods ,",
    "a similar approach as in sledge can be used to truncate a singular problem . for these methods",
    "the coefficients are only evaluated in the legendre nodes .",
    "since the first and last legendre node in an interval are not equal to the beginpoint or endpoint of that interval , a singular problem is implicitly truncated . by decreasing the size of the first interval ( if @xmath2 is a singular endpoint ) or the last interval ( if @xmath3 is a singular endpoint ) in the mesh , the implicit truncation points move closer to the singular endpoint",
    ". however no software based on higher order modified integral methods is currently availabe which can automatically handle singular endpoints . for this reason",
    ", sledge is still the package of choice for many applications .",
    "we consider two well - known test problems .",
    "the coffey - evans equation is one of the more difficult test problems in the literature ( test problem 7 in @xcite , introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "it is a schrdinger equation with @xmath198 and @xmath199 as boundary conditions .",
    "the first 50 eigenvalues for @xmath200 have been determined .",
    "for this potential @xmath201 is close to zero and there are very close eigenvalue triplets @xmath202 , @xmath203 as @xmath38 increases .",
    "the second problem is a problem from chemical physics : the woods - saxon problem @xcite defined by @xmath204 with @xmath205 over the interval @xmath206 $ ] .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of this woods - saxon problem contains 14 eigenenergies @xmath207 .",
    "tables [ tab : coffeyevansproblem ]  [ tab : wsproblem2 ] show some results for the two test problems obtained with five different coefficient approximation methods .",
    "the first method used is the pruess method of order @xmath208 .",
    "this method is compared with some higher order methods which were discussed in section [ filonsection ] : a neumann method and a magnus method of order @xmath209 , and a neumann method and magnus method of order @xmath210 .",
    "we present for each problem , a selection of the considered exact eigenvalues @xmath47 , and the ( absolute ) error for the corresponding eigenvalues calculated with the coefficient approximation methods . for the moment",
    "equidistant meshes are used in order to allow easier comparison between the different algorithms .",
    "an automatic stepsize selection algorithm will be discussed afterwards .",
    ".absolute value of ( absolute ) errors @xmath211 in the eigenvalues computed for the coffey - evans problem with different coefficient approximation methods and @xmath212 steps in the equidistant mesh .",

    "@xmath214 is the order of the method . [",

    "in this paper we discussed some techniques which allow the efficient approximation of high eigenvalues of a sturm - liouville problem .",
    "we focused in particular on algorithms based on approximation of the coefficient functions of the differential equation .",
    "the simplest coefficient approximation method is the so - called pruess method , which replaces the coefficient functions over each mesh interval by the midpoint value in that interval and then solves ( analytically ) the approximating problem .",
    "this pruess method has some significant advantages over shooting methods based on standard initial - value solvers especially when looking for higher eigenvalues and was implemented in the well - known sturm - liouville solver sledge .",
    "the oscillations in the eigenfunctions no longer determine ( restrict ) the step sizes .",
    "now the step sizes depend on the errors made in replacing the coefficient functions by piecewise constant approximations .",
    "it is clear that larger steps could be taken when the coefficient functions are replaced by higher order polynomials .",
    "however when the coefficient functions are replaced by polynomials of degree greater than zero , the approximating problem is not really easier to solve than the original problem .",
    "therefore only piecewise constant ( and linear ) polynomial approximations were used for a long time .",
    "but , neumann or magnus integral series offer a way to construct methods based on higher order ( piecewise ) polynomial approximation . using ( modified ) neumann or magnus schemes",
    ", we can construct methods which still allow the easy analytic integration of an approximating problem with piecewise constant coefficients but use higher order polynomial approximations to construct some extra ( correction ) terms .",
    "depending on the number of terms included in the neumann or magnus series , algorithms of different orders can be constructed .",
    "experiments show that indeed these neumann and magnus integrators share the advantages of the pruess method and allow to approximate high eigenvalues in a remarkably small number of steps .",
    "also a singular problem was considered to illustrate that singular endpoints can be dealt with in a relatively simple way ."
