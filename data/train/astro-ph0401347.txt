    "our knowledge of the physical world has reached a most remarkable state .",
    "we have established economical  standard models \" both for cosmology and for fundamental physics , which provide the conceptual foundation for describing a vast variety of phenomena in terms of a small number of input parameters .",
    "no existing observations are in conflict with these standard models .",
    "this achievement allows us to pose , and have genuine prospects to answer , new questions of great depth and ambition .",
    "indeed , the standard models themselves , through their weirdness and esthetic failings , suggest several such questions .    a good way to get",
    "a critical perspective on these standard models is to review the external inputs they require to make them go .",
    "( there is a nice word for such input parameters :  exogenous \" , born on the outside . ",
    "endogenous \" parameters , by contrast , are explained from within . )",
    "this exercise also exposes interesting things about the nature of the models .",
    "what is usually called the standard model of particle physics is actually a rather arbitrary truncation of our knowledge of fundamental physics , and a hybrid to boot . in",
    "is more accurate and more informative to speak of two beautiful theories and one rather ramshackle working model : the gauge theory , the gravity theory , and the flavor / higgs model .",
    "the gauge theory is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "it is based on the local ( yang - mills ) symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "the fermions in each family fall into 5 separate irreducible representations of this symmetry .",
    "they are assigned , on phenomenological grounds , the funny @xmath1 hypercharges displayed there as subscripts . of course",
    ", notoriously , the whole family structure is triplicated .",
    "one also needs a single @xmath2 singlet , @xmath3 doublet scalar ",
    "higgs \" field with hypercharge @xmath4 .",
    "taken together , gauge symmetry and renormalizability greatly restrict the number of independent couplings that are allowed .",
    "putting aside for a moment yukawa couplings of fermions and higgs field , there are just three continuous parameters , namely the universal interaction strengths of the different gauge fields .",
    "( there is a subtlety here regarding the @xmath1 charges . since implementing @xmath1 gauge symmetry does not automatically quantize charge",
    ", the hypercharge assignments might appear to involve many continuous parameters , which on phenomenological grounds we must choose to have extremely special values . and that is true , classically .",
    "but consistency of the quantum theory requires cancellation of anomalies .",
    "this requirement greatly constrains the possible hypercharge assignments , bringing us down essentially to the ones we adopt . )",
    "i should emphasize that gauge symmetry and renormalizability are deeply tied up with the consistency and existence of quantum field theories involving vector mesons . taking a little poetic license , we could say that they are not independent assumptions at all , but rather consequences of special relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "general relativity manifestly provides a beautiful , conceptually driven theory of gravity .",
    "it has scored many triumphs , both qualitative ( big bang cosmology , black hole physics ) and quantitative ( precession of mercury , binary pulsar ) . the low - energy effective theory of gravity and the other interactions",
    "is defined algorithmically by the minimal coupling prescription , or equivalently by restricting to low - dimension operators . in this context ,  low \" means compared to the planck energy scale , so this effective theory is very effective indeed . as in the gauge sector , symmetry  here , general covariance  greatly constrains the possible couplings , bringing us down to just two relevant parameters .",
    "almost all the observed phenomena of gravity are described using only one of these parameters , namely newton s gravitational constant .",
    "we are just now coming to accept that the other parameter , the value of the cosmological term , plays an important role in describing late - time cosmology .",
    "this impressive effective field theory of gravity is perfectly quantum - mechanical .",
    "it supports , for example , the existence of gravitons as the particulate form of gravity waves .",
    "there are major unsolved problems in gravity , to be sure , a few of which i ll discuss below , but they should nt be overblown or made to seem mystical .",
    "the third component of the standard model consists , one might say , of the potential energy terms .",
    "they are the terms that do nt arise from gauge or space - time covariant derivatives .",
    "( note that field strengths and curvatures are commutators of covariant derivatives . )",
    "all these terms involve the higgs field , in one way or another .",
    "they include the higgs field mass and its self - coupling , and the yukawa couplings .",
    "we know of no deep principle , comparable to gauge symmetry or general covariance , which constrains the values of these couplings tightly .",
    "for that reason , it is in this sector where continuous parameters proliferate , into the dozens .",
    "basically , we introduce each observed mass and weak mixing angle as an independent input , which must be determined empirically .",
    "the phenomenology is not entirely out of control : the general framework ( local relativistic quantum field theory , gauge symmetry , and renormalizability ) has significant consequences , and even this part of the standard model makes many non - trivial predictions and is highly over - constrained . in particular , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) parameterization of weak currents and cp violation has , so far , survived close new scrutiny at the b - factories intact .",
    "neutrino masses and mixings can be accommodated along similar lines , if we expand the framework slightly .",
    "the simplest possibility is to allow for minimally non - renormalizable ( mass dimension 5 )  ultra - yukawa \" terms .",
    "these terms involve two powers of the scalar higgs field . to accommodate the observed neutrino masses and mixings",
    ", they must occur with very small coefficients .",
    "the emerging  standard model of cosmology \" is also something of a hybrid .",
    "one part of it is simply a concrete parameterization of the equation of state to insert into the framework of general relativistic models of a spatially uniform expanding universe ( friedmann - robertson - walker model ) ; the other is a very specific hypothesis about the primordial fluctuations from uniformity .",
    "corresponding to the first part , one set of exogenous parameters in the standard model of cosmology specifies a few average properties of matter , taken over large spatial volumes .",
    "these are the densities of ordinary matter ( i.e. , of baryons ) , of dark matter , and of dark energy .    we know quite a lot about ordinary matter , of course , and we can detect it at great distances by several methods .",
    "it contributes about 3% of the total density .",
    "concerning dark ( actually , transparent ) matter we know much less .",
    "it has been  seen \" only indirectly , through the influence of its gravity on the motion of visible matter .",
    "we observe that dark matter exerts very little pressure , and that it contributes about 30% of the total density .",
    "finally dark ( actually , transparent ) energy contributes about 67% of the total density .",
    "it has a large _ negative _ pressure . from the point of view of fundamental physics",
    "this dark energy is quite mysterious and disturbing , as i ll elaborate shortly below .",
    "given the constraint of spatial flatness , these three densities are not independent .",
    "they must add up to a critical density that depends only the strength of gravity and the rate of expansion of the universe .",
    "fortunately , our near - total ignorance concerning the nature of most of the mass of the universe does not bar us from modeling its evolution .",
    "that s because the dominant interaction on large scales is gravity , and according to general relativity gravity does not care about details . according to general relativity , only total energy - momentum counts  or equivalently , for uniform matter , total density and pressure .    assuming these values for the relative densities , and",
    "that the geometry of space is flat  and still assuming uniformity  we can use the equations of general relativity to extrapolate the present expansion of the universe back to earlier times .",
    "this procedure defines the standard big bang scenario .",
    "it successfully predicts several things that would otherwise be very difficult to understand , including the red shift of distant galaxies , the existence of the microwave background radiation , and the relative abundance of light nuclear isotopes .",
    "it is also internally consistent , and even self - validating , in that the microwave background is observed to be uniform to high accuracy , namely to a few parts in @xmath5 .",
    "the other exogenous parameter in the standard model of cosmology concerns the small departures from uniformity in the early universe .",
    "the seeds grow by gravitational instability , with over - dense regions attracting more matter , thus increasing their density contrast with time .",
    "this process plausibly could , starting from very small seeds , eventually trigger the formation of galaxies , stars , and other structures we observe today . _",
    "a priori _ one might consider all kinds of assumptions about the initial fluctuations , and over the years many hypotheses have been proposed . but",
    "recent observations , especially the recent , gorgeous wmap measurements of microwave background anisotropies , favor what in many ways is the simplest possible guess , the so - called harrison - zeldovich spectrum . in this set - up the fluctuations are assumed to be strongly random  uncorrelated and gaussian with a scale invariant spectrum at horizon entry , to be precise  and to affect both ordinary and dark matter equally ( adiabatic fluctuations ) . given these strong assumptions just one parameter , the overall amplitude of fluctuations , defines the statistical distribution completely . with the appropriate value for this amplitude , and the relative density parameters i mentioned before ,",
    "this standard model cosmological model fits the wmap data and other measures of large - scale structure remarkably well .",
    "the structure of the gauge sector of the standard model gives powerful suggestions for its further development .",
    "the product structure @xmath0 , the reducibility of the fermion representation , and the peculiar values of the hypercharge assignments all suggest the possibility of a larger symmetry , that would encompass the three factors , unite the representations , and fix the hypercharges .",
    "the devil is in the details , and it is not at all automatic that the observed , complex pattern of matter will fit neatly into a simple mathematical structure .",
    "but , to a remarkable extent , it does .",
    "the smallest simple group into which @xmath0 could possibly fit , that is @xmath6 , fits all the fermions of a single family into two representations ( @xmath7 ) , and the hypercharges click into place .",
    "a larger symmetry group , @xmath8 , fits these and one additional @xmath9 singlet particle into a single representation , the spinor @xmath10 .",
    "the additional particle is actually quite welcome .",
    "it has the quantum numbers of a right - handed neutrino , and it plays a crucial role in the attractive  seesaw \" model of neutrino masses , of which more below .",
    "this unification of quantum numbers , though attractive , remains purely formal until it is embedded in a physical model .",
    "that requires realizing the enhanced symmetry in a local gauge theory .",
    "but nonabelian gauge symmetry requires universality : it requires that the relative strengths of the different couplings must be equal , which is not what is observed .",
    "fortunately , there is a compelling way to save the situation .",
    "if the higher symmetry is broken at a large energy scale ( equivalently , a small distance scale ) , then we observe interactions at smaller energies ( larger distances ) whose intrinsic strength has been affected by the physics of vacuum polarization .",
    "the running of couplings is an effect that can be calculated rather precisely , in favorable cases ( basically , for weak coupling ) , given a definite hypothesis about the particle spectrum . in this way we can test , quantitatively , the idea that the observed couplings derive from a single unified value .",
    "results from these calculations are quite remarkable and encouraging .",
    "if we include vacuum polarization from the particles we know about in the minimal standard model , we find approximate unification . if we include vacuum polarization from the particles needed to expand the standard model to include supersymmetry , softly broken at the tev scale , we find accurate unification .",
    "the unification occurs at a very large energy scale , of order @xmath11 gev .",
    "this success is robust against small changes in the susy breaking scale , and is not adversely affected by incorporation of additional particle multiplets , so long as they form complete representations of @xmath6 .    on the other hand , many proposals for physics beyond the standard model at the tev scale ( technicolor models , large extra dimension scenarios , most brane - world scenarios ) corrupt the foundations of the unification of couplings calculation , and would render its success accidental . for me , this greatly diminishes the credibility of such proposals .    low - energy supersymmetry is desirable on several other grounds , as well .",
    "the most important has to do with the  black sheep \" of the standard model , the scalar higgs doublet . in the absence of supersymmetry radiative corrections to the vacuum expectation value of the higgs particle",
    "diverge , and one must fix its value ( which , of course , sets the scale for electroweak symmetry breaking ) by hand , as a renormalized parameter . that leaves it mysterious why the empirical value is so much smaller than unification scales .",
    "upon more detailed consideration the question takes shape and sharpens considerably .",
    "enhanced unification symmetry requires that the higgs doublet should have partners , to fill out a complete representation .",
    "however these partners have the quantum numbers to mediate proton decay , and so if they exist at all their masses must be very large , of order the unification scale @xmath11 gev .",
    "this reinforces the idea that such a large mass is what is  natural \" for a scalar field , and that the light doublet we invoke in the standard model requires some special justification",
    ". it would be facile to claim that low - energy supersymmetry by itself cleanly solves these problems , but it does provide powerful theoretical tools for addressing them .",
    "the fact that an enormous new mass scale for unification is indicated by these calculations is profound .",
    "this enormous mass scale is inferred entirely from low - energy data .",
    "the disparity of scales arises from the slow ( logarithmic ) running of inverse couplings , which implies that modest differences in observed couplings must be made up by a long interval of running .",
    "the appearance of a very large mass scale is welcome on several grounds .",
    "* right - handed neutrinos can have normal , dimension - four yukawa couplings to the lepton doublet . in @xmath8",
    "such couplings are pretty much mandatory , since they are related by symmetry to those responsible for charge-@xmath12 quark masses . in addition , being neutral under @xmath13 they , unlike the fermions of the standard model , can have a majorana type self - mass without breaking these low - energy symmetries .",
    "we might expect the self - mass to arise where it is first allowed , at the scale where @xmath8 breaks ( or its moral equivalent ) .",
    "masses of that magnitude remove these particles from the accessible spectrum , but they have an important indirect effect . in second - order perturbation theory the ordinary left - handed neutrinos , through their ordinary yukawa couplings , make virtual transitions to their right - handed relatives and back .",
    "this generates non - zero masses for the ordinary neutrinos that are much smaller than the masses of other leptons and quarks .",
    "the magnitudes predicted in this way are broadly consistent with the observed tiny masses .",
    "no more than order - of - magnitude success can be claimed , because many relevant details of the models are poorly determined .",
    "* unification tends to obliterate the distinction between quarks and leptons , and hence to open up the possibility of proton decay .",
    "heroic experiments to observe this process have so far come up empty , with limits on partial lifetimes approaching @xmath14 years for some channels .",
    "it is very difficult to assure that these processes are sufficiently suppressed , unless the unification scale is very large .",
    "even the high scale indicated by running of couplings and neutrino masses is barely adequate . spinning it positively , experiments to search for proton decay remain a most important and promising probe into unification physics . * similarly , it is difficult to avoid the idea that unification , brings in new connections among the different families .",
    "there are significant experimental constraints on strangeness - changing neutral currents , lepton number violation , and other exotic processes that must be suppressed , and this makes a high scale welcome .",
    "* axion physics requires a high scale of peccei - quinn symmetry breaking , in order to implement weakly coupled ,  invisible \" axion models . * with the appearance of this large scale , unification of the strong and electroweak interactions with gravity becomes much more plausible .",
    "newton s constant has dimensions of mass@xmath15 , so it runs even classically . or , to put it another way , gravity responds to energy - momentum , so it gets stronger at large energy scales .",
    "nevertheless , because gravity starts out extremely feeble compared to other interactions on laboratory scales , it becomes roughly equipotent with them only at enormously high scales , comparable to the planck energy @xmath16 gev . by inverting this thought",
    ", we gain a deep insight into one of the main riddles about gravity : if gravity is a primary feature of nature , reflecting the basic structure of space - time , why does it ordinarily appear so feeble ?",
    "elsewhere , i have tracked the answer down to the fact that at the unification ( planck ) scale the strong coupling @xmath17 is about @xmath18 !    these considerations delineate a compelling research program , centered on gathering more evidence for , and information about , the unification of fundamental interactions .",
    "we need to find low - energy supersymmetry , and to look hard for proton decay and for axions .",
    "and we need to be alert to the possibility of direct information from extreme astrophysical objects and their relics .",
    "such objects include , of course , the early universe as a whole , but also perhaps contemporary cosmic defects ( strings , domain walls ) .",
    "they could leave their mark in microwave background anisotropies and polarization , in gravity waves , or as sources of unconventional and/or ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "theoretical suggestions for enhancing the other two components of our standard model of fundamental physics are less well formed .",
    "i ll confine myself to a few brief observations .",
    "non - minimal coupling terms arise in the extension of supersymmetry to include gravity .",
    "such terms play an important role in many models of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "although it will require a lot of detective work to isolate and characterize such terms , they offer a unique and potentially rich source of information about the role of gravity in unification .",
    "the flavor / higgs sector of fundamental physics is its least satisfactory part . whether measured by the large number of independent parameters or by the small number of powerful ideas it contains",
    ", our theoretical description of this sector does not attain the same level as we ve reached in the other sectors .",
    "this part really does deserve to be called a  model \" rather than a  theory \" .",
    "there are many opportunities for experiments to supply additional information .",
    "these include determining masses , weak mixing angles and phases for quarks ; the same for neutrinos ; searches for @xmath19 and allied processes ; looking for electric dipole moments ; and others .",
    "if low - energy supersymmetry is indeed discovered , there will be many additional masses and mixings to sort out .",
    "the big question for theorists is : what are we going to do with this information ?",
    "we need some good ideas that will relate these hard - won answers to truly fundamental questions .",
    "cosmology has been  reduced \" to some general hypotheses and just four exogenous parameters .",
    "it is an amazing development . yet",
    "i think that most physicists will not , and should not , feel entirely satisfied with it .",
    "the parameters appearing in the cosmological model , unlike those in the comparable models of matter , do not describe the fundamental behavior of simple entities .",
    "rather they appear as summary descriptors of averaged properties of macroscopic ( very macroscopic ! ) agglomerations .",
    "they appear neither as key players in a varied repertoire of phenomena nor as essential elements in a beautiful mathematical theory . due to these shortcomings",
    "we are left wondering why just these parameters appear necessary to make a working description of existing observations , and uncertain whether we ll need to include more as observations are refined .",
    "we d like to carry the analysis to another level , where the four working parameters will give way to different ones that are closer to fundamentals .",
    "there are many ideas for how an asymmetry between matter and antimatter , which after much mutual annihilation could boil down to the present baryon density , might be generated in the early universe .",
    "several of them seem capable of giving the observed value .",
    "unfortunately the answer generally depends on details of particle physics at energies that are unlikely to be accessible experimentally any time soon .",
    "so for a decision among them we may be reduced to waiting for a functioning theory of ( nearly ) everything .",
    "i m much more optimistic about the dark matter problem . here",
    "we have the unusual situation that there are two good ideas , which according to william of occam ( of razor fame ) is one too many .",
    "the symmetry of the standard model can be enhanced , and some of its aesthetic shortcomings can be overcome , if we extend it to a larger theory .",
    "two proposed extensions , logically independent of one another , are particularly specific and compelling .",
    "one of these incorporates a symmetry suggested by roberto peccei and helen quinn .",
    "pq symmetry rounds out the logical structure of qcd , by removing qcd s potential to support strong violation of time - reversal symmetry , which is not observed .",
    "this extension predicts the existence of a remarkable new kind of very light , feebly interacting particle : axions .",
    "the other incorporates supersymmetry , an extension of special relativity to include quantum space - timed transformations .",
    "supersymmetry serves several important qualitative and quantitative purposes in modern thinking about unification , relieving difficulties with understanding why w bosons are as light as they are and why the couplings of the standard model take the values they do . in many implementations of supersymmetry the lightest supersymmetric particle , or lsp , interacts rather feebly with ordinary matter ( though much more strongly than do axions ) and is stable on cosmological time scales .",
    "the properties of these particles , axion or lsp , are just right for dark matter",
    ". moreover you can calculate how abundantly they would be produced in the big bang , and in both cases the prediction for the abundance is quite promising .",
    "there are vigorous , heroic experimental searches underway to dark matter in either of these forms .",
    "we will also get crucial information about supersymmetry from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , starting in 2007 .",
    "i will be disappointed  and surprised  if we do nt have a much more personalized portrait of the dark matter in hand a decade from now .    it remains to say a few words about the remaining parameter , the density of dark energy .",
    "there are two problems with this : why it is so small ?",
    "why is it so big ?",
    "a great lesson of the standard model is that what we have been evolved to perceive as empty space is in fact a richly structured medium .",
    "it contains symmetry - breaking condensates associated with electroweak superconductivity and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , an effervescence of virtual particles , and probably much more . since gravity is sensitive to all forms of energy it really ought to see this stuff , even if we do nt .",
    "a straightforward estimation suggests that empty space should weigh several orders of magnitude of orders of magnitude ( no misprint here ! ) more than it does .",
    "it  should \" be much denser than a neutron star , for example .",
    "the expected energy of empty space acts like dark energy , with negative pressure , but there s much too much of it .    to me",
    "this discrepancy is the most mysterious fact in all of physical science , the fact with the greatest potential to rock the foundations .",
    "we re obviously missing some major insight here .",
    "given this situation , it s hard to know what to make of the ridiculously small amount of dark energy that presently dominates the universe !",
    "the emerging possibility of forging links between fundamental physics and cosmology through models of inflation is good reason for excitement and optimism .",
    "several assumptions in the standard cosmological model , specifically uniformity , spatial flatness , and the scale invariant , gaussian , adiabatic ( harrison - zeldovich ) spectrum , were originally suggested on grounds of simplicity , expediency , or esthetics . they can be supplanted with a single dynamical hypothesis : that very early in its history the universe underwent a period of superluminal expansion , or inflation .",
    "such a period could have occurred while a matter field that was coherently excited out of its ground state permeated the universe .",
    "possibilities of this kind are easy to imagine in models of fundamental physics .",
    "for example scalar fields are used to implement symmetry breaking even in the standard model , and such fields can easily fail to shed energy quickly enough to stay close to their ground state as the universe expands .",
    "inflation will occur if the approach to the ground state is slow enough .",
    "fluctuations will be generated because the relaxation process is not quite synchronized across the universe .",
    "inflation is a wonderfully attractive , logically compelling idea , but very basic challenges remain .",
    "can we be specific about the cause of inflation , grounding it in specific , well - founded , and preferably beautiful models of fundamental physics ? concretely , can we calculate the correct amplitude of fluctuations convincingly ?",
    "existing implementations actually have a problem here ; it takes some nice adjustment to get the amplitude sufficiently small .",
    "more hopeful , perhaps , than the difficult business of extracting hard quantitative predictions from a broadly flexible idea , is to follow up on the essentially new and surprising possibilities it suggests .",
    "the violent restructuring of space - time attending inflation should generate detectable gravitational waves .",
    "these can be detected through their effect on polarization of the microwave background . and",
    "the non - trivial dynamics of relaxation should generate some detectable deviation from a strictly scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "these are very well posed questions , begging for experimental answers .",
    "perhaps not quite so sharply posed , but still very promising , is the problem of the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "it remains controversial whether there so many events observed at energies above those where protons or photons could travel cosmological distances that explaining their existence requires us to invoke new fundamental physics .",
    "however this plays out , we clearly have a lot to learn about the compositions of these events , their sources , and the acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the observed values of the ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 are extremely peculiar from the point of view of fundamental physics , as currently understood .",
    "leading ideas from fundamental theory about the origin of dark matter and the origin of baryon number ascribe them to causes that are at best very remotely connected , and existing physical ideas about the dark energy , which are sketchy at best , do nt connect it to either of the others . yet",
    "the ratios are observed to be close to unity . and",
    "the fact that these ratios are close to unity is crucial to cosmic ecology ; the world would be a very different place if their values were grossly different from what they are .",
    "several physicists , among whom s. weinberg was one of the earliest and remains among the most serious and persistent , have been led to wonder whether it might be useful , or even necessary , to take a different approach , invoking anthropic reasoning .",
    "many physicists view such reasoning as a compromise or even a betrayal of the goal of understanding the world in rational , scientific terms .",
    "certainly , some adherents of the  anthropic principle \" have overdone it .",
    "no such `` principle '' can substitute for deep principles like symmetry and locality , which support a vast wealth of practical and theoretical applications , or the algorithmic description of nature in general .",
    "but i believe there are specific , limited circumstances in which anthropic reasoning is manifestly appropriate and unavoidable .",
    "in fact , i will now sketch an existence proof .",
    "i will need to use a few properties of axions , which i should briefly recall .",
    "given its extensive symmetry and the tight structure of relativistic quantum field theory , the definition of qcd only requires , and only permits , a very restricted set of parameters .",
    "these consist of the coupling constant and the quark masses , which we ve already discussed , and one more  the so - called @xmath22  parameter .",
    "physical results depend periodically upon @xmath22 , so that effectively it can take values between @xmath23 .",
    "we do nt know the actual value of the @xmath22 parameter , but only a limit , @xmath24 .",
    "values outside this small range are excluded by experimental results , principally the tight bound on the electric dipole moment of the neutron .",
    "the discrete symmetries p and t are violated unless @xmath25 ( mod @xmath26 ) .",
    "since there are p and t violating interactions in the world , the @xmath22 parameter ca nt be to zero by any strict symmetry assumption .",
    "so understanding its smallness is a challenge .",
    "the effective value of @xmath22 will be affected by dynamics , and in particular by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "peccei and quinn discovered that if one imposed a certain asymptotic symmetry , and if that symmetry were broken spontaneously , then an effective value @xmath27 would be obtained .",
    "weinberg and i explained that the approach @xmath28 could be understood as a relaxation process , whereby a very light field , corresponding quite directly to @xmath22 , settles into its minimum energy state .",
    "this is the axion field , and its quanta are called axions .    the phenomenology of axions is essentially controlled by one parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath29 has dimensions of mass .",
    "it is the scale at which peccei - quinn symmetry breaks .",
    "now let us consider the cosmological implications .",
    "peccei - quinn symmetry is unbroken at temperatures @xmath30 .",
    "when this symmetry breaks the initial value of the phase , that is @xmath31 , is random beyond the then - current horizon scale .",
    "one can analyze the fate of these fluctuations by solving the equations for a scalar field in an expanding universe .",
    "the main general results are as follows .",
    "there is an effective cosmic viscosity , which keeps the field frozen so long as the hubble parameter @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the expansion factor . in the opposite limit",
    "@xmath34 the field undergoes lightly damped oscillations , which result in an energy density that decays as @xmath35 . which is to say , a comoving volume contains a fixed mass .",
    "the field can be regarded as a gas of nonrelativistic particles ( in a coherent state ) .",
    "there is some additional damping at intermediate stages .",
    "roughly speaking we may say that the axion field , or any scalar field in a classical regime , behaves as an effective cosmological term for @xmath36 and as cold dark matter for @xmath37 .",
    "inhomogeneous perturbations are frozen in while their length - scale exceeds @xmath38 , the scale of the apparent horizon , then get damped .",
    "if we ignore the possibility of inflation , then there is a unique result for the cosmic axion density , given the microscopic model .",
    "the criterion @xmath39 is satisfied for @xmath40 .",
    "at this point the horizon - volume contains many horizon - volumes from the peccei - quinn scale , but it still contains only a negligible amount of energy by contemporary cosmological standards .",
    "thus in comparing to current observations , it is appropriate to average over the starting amplitude @xmath41 statistically .",
    "if we do nt fix the baryon - to - photon ratio , but instead demand spatial flatness , as inflation suggests we should , then for @xmath42 gev the baryon density we compute is smaller than what we observe .",
    "if inflation occurs before the peccei - quinn transition , this analysis remains valid .",
    "but if inflation occurs after the transition , things are quite different .      for",
    "if inflation occurs after the transition , then the patches where @xmath43 is approximately homogeneous get magnified to enormous size .",
    "each one is far larger than the presently observable universe .",
    "the observable universe no longer contains a fair statistical sample of @xmath41 , but some particular  accidenta \" value .",
    "of course there is still a larger structure , which martin rees calls the multiverse , over which the value varies .",
    "now if @xmath44 gev , we could still be consistent with cosmological constraints on the axion density , so long as the amplitude satisfies @xmath45 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath41 , which controls a crucial regularity of the observable universe , is contingent in a very strong sense .",
    "in fact , it is different  elsewhere \" .    within this scenario ,",
    "the anthropic principle is demonstrably correct and appropriate .",
    "regions having large values of @xmath41 , in which axions by far dominate baryons , seem likely to prove inhospitable for the development of complex structures .",
    "axions themselves are weakly interacting and essentially dissipationless , and they dilute the baryons , so that these too stay dispersed . in principle",
    "laboratory experiments could discover axions with @xmath46 gev .",
    "if they did , we would have to conclude that the vast bulk of the multiverse was inhospitable to intelligent life .",
    "and we d be forced to appeal to the anthropic principle to understand the anomalously modest axion density in our universe .",
    "weinberg considered anthropic reasoning in connection with the density of dark energy .",
    "it would be entertaining to let both densities , and perhaps other parameters , float simultaneously , to see whether anthropic reasoning favors the observed values .",
    "of course , in the absence of a plausible microscopic setting , these are quite speculative exercises .",
    "we do nt know , at present , which if any combinations of the basic parameters that appear in our desciption of nature vary independently over the multiverse .",
    "but to the extent anthropic reasoning succeeds , it might guide us toward some specific hypotheses about fundamental physics ( e.g. , that axions provide the dark matter , that @xmath44 gev , that the dark matter candidates suggested by supersymmetry are subdominant , or perhaps unstable on cosmological time scales ) .",
    "one last thought , inspired by these considerations .",
    "the essence of the peccei - quinn mechanism is to promote the phase of quark mass matrix to an independent , dynamically variable field .",
    "could additional aspects of the quark and lepton mass matrices likewise be represented as dynamical fields ?",
    "in fact , this sort of set - up appears quite naturally in supersymmetric models , under the rubric  flat directions \" or  moduli \" . under certain not entirely implausible conditions particles associated with these moduli fields could be accessible at future accelerators , specifically the lhc .",
    "if so , their study could shed new light on the family / higgs sector , where we need it badly .",
    "the way in which many of our most ambitious questions , arising from the perimeters of logically independent circles of ideas , overlap and link up is remarkable . it might be a sign that we poised to break through to a new level of integration in our understanding of the physical world . of course , to achieve that we will need not only sharp ambitious questions , but also some convincing answers .",
    "there are many promising lines to pursue , as even this brief and very incomplete discussion has revealed ."
