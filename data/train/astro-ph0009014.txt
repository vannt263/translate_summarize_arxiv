    "there is evidence that at least some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are related to supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "grb  980425 , grb  970514 and grb  980919 are consistent with being in temporal as well as spatial coincidence with sn1998bw , sn1997cy and sn1999e , respectively @xcite .",
    "the associations between grb  970514 and sn1997cy , and between grb  980919 and sn1999e , could be by chance .",
    "however , this is very unlikely for grb  980425 since the temporal and spatial constraints are much tighter than for the two other possible grb / sn associations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence for a contribution from sne to the light - curves of grb  970228 and grb  980326 @xcite .",
    "however , less than 0.2% of sne release detectable gamma - ray emission @xcite , and sn1997cy , sn1998bw and sn1999e were extremely bright and peculiar sne .",
    "this association between grbs and peculiar sne suggests that grb  980425 ( and possibly also grb  970514 and grb  980919 ) were members of a rare class of grbs and may not be indicative of normal grbs .",
    "however , the temporal and spatial properties of the gamma radiation from grb  980425 , except for the low total luminosity , were not unusual @xcite .    in this",
    "we present space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) clear and long - pass images of the host galaxy of sn1998bw as part of a large survey aimed at studying the morphology of grb host galaxies and the locations of the grbs within the host galaxies .",
    "sn1998bw occurred in a spiral arm of the face - on sb galaxy eso  184g82 @xcite .",
    "the redshift of eso  184g82 is 0.0085 @xcite .",
    "the aims of this _ letter _ are to characterize the region in eso  184g82 where sn1998bw occurred , and to measure or constrain the brightness of sn1998bw at a late epoch more than two years after the event .",
    "we use a hubble parameter of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and assume @xmath4 and @xmath5 throughout this _",
    "letter_. for this cosmology a redshift of @xmath6 corresponds to a luminosity distance of @xmath7 mpc and a scale of @xmath8 proper parsecs per arcsecond .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) was used to obtain stis / ccd images of eso  184g82 between 21:47 ut and 23:42 ut on 11 june 2000 @xcite .",
    "a log of the _ hst _ observations is given in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "the total exposure times were 1240 seconds in the 50ccd ( clear , hereafter referred to as cl ) aperture and 1185 seconds in the f28x50lp ( long pass , hereafter referred to as lp ) aperture .",
    "the ccd gain was set to @xmath9 and the read - out noise was 4.46 adu / pixel .",
    "the data was processed through the standard stis pipeline and combined using the dither ( v1.2 ) software @xcite as implemented in iraf ( v2.11.1)/stsdas ( v2.0.2 ) .",
    "we used `` pixfrac '' @xmath10 and a final output scale of @xmath11/pixel .",
    "these observations were taken as part of the cycle 9 program go-8640 : survey of the host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the url for the survey is http://www.ifa.au.dk/~hst/grb_hosts/index.html @xcite .",
    "the drizzled cl image is shown as fig .",
    "[ stisall ] .",
    "eso  184g82 is a barred spiral galaxy of hubble type sbc @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the galaxy is @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath14 using @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is clearly in a stage of active star formation .",
    "[ stisall ] shows that the optical appearance of the galaxy is dominated by a large number of high surface brightness star forming regions especially in the southern spiral arm where the sn occurred .",
    "when comparing the cl and lp images a large number of red giants can be seen within or near the star forming regions ( two examples are seen in fig .",
    "[ stiszoom ] ) .",
    "as also noted by @xcite eso  184g82 is member of a group of galaxies consisting of the three galaxies eso  184g80 , eso  184g81 and eso  184g82 .",
    "furthermore , there is an previously unclassified sb galaxy @xmath16 south of eso  184g82 and a fainter bulge - dominated galaxy @xmath17 south of eso  184g82 .",
    "hence , the star formation activity could be enhanced by interaction ( see   [ discuss ] ) .",
    "the most precise determination of the absolute position of sn1998bw on the sky is based on the radio observations made with the australian telescope compact array april 28 1998 @xcite .",
    "this position is ra @xmath18 19:35:03.31 , dec .",
    "@xmath18 @xmath1952:50:44.7 ( j2000.0 ) with an error of @xmath20 .",
    "however , sn1998bw was very faint at the time of the stis observations , and there are no other sources in the stis field of view ( fov ) for which positions have been determined with equally high precision . in order to determine relative astrometry between sn1998bw and other objects in the stis fov we therefore retrieved images obtained with the eso - vlt antu telescope with the fors1 instrument from the eso archive .",
    "these images were taken at an epoch ( 1999 april 18 ) when the sn was still clearly visible .",
    "the journal of archive data is given in table  [ archivelog ] @xcite .",
    "the precise location of the sn in the stis cl image was derived from the ground based vlt images in the following way .",
    "the stis images revealed several bright blue objects within @xmath21 of the position of the sn .",
    "these objects were covered under the point - spread function ( psf ) in the vlt images , which had a seeing of about @xmath22 .",
    "this affected the centroid determination of the sn somewhat , giving rise to a colour dependent position error of @xmath23 drizzled stis pixels ( @xmath24 ) . by smoothing , scaling , and transforming the stis cl and lp images , the contribution from the host galaxy , including the clusters in the proximity of the sn ,",
    "could be subtracted completely from the vlt @xmath25 and @xmath26 images .",
    "astrometry , based on these two subtracted images , gave accurate and internally consistent positions , based on six and eleven reference stars .",
    "the fits are six - parameter affine fits , with weights calculated from a noise model .",
    "the errors are the standard deviations of the residuals in the fit , properly normalized by weights and degrees of freedom .",
    "the final error of the weighted position was estimated to be about @xmath27 drizzled pixels in the cl image , or about @xmath0 . in the drizzled lp",
    "the error is slightly smaller .    in order to check this position",
    "daophot  ii @xcite with extensions ( daomatch and daomaster ) was applied to the drizzled stis lp image and the ground based vlt @xmath28 image , respectively .",
    "subsequently the two auxiliary programs daomatch and daomaster were used to derive a four - parameter transformation ( offset , scale and orientation ) from the positions of five isolated stars judged to be free of superposed nebulosities .",
    "the transformed position of the sn is within @xmath29 pixels of the value derived from our more formal astrometric procedure .",
    "as also noted by @xcite and @xcite the sn is superposed on an region .",
    "the diameter of this region is approximately between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , corresponding to a physical diameter of between @xmath32 and @xmath33 pc at @xmath6 .",
    "[ stiszoom]a shows a region with a size of @xmath34 centered on the position of the sn as determined in sect .",
    "[ astrometry ] . at the exact position of the sn is the object marked by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ stiszoom]a .",
    "the object is also seen in the lp image shown in fig .",
    "[ stiszoom]c . in the following",
    "we will refer to this object as the sn .",
    "also seen are six objects ( in the following refered to as s1s6 ) consistent with being point sources . in the cl image there appears to be an arc - like structure extending from the sn towards s6 .",
    "we estimated the total ab magnitude of the sn , the other point sources ( s1s6 ) visible in fig .",
    "[ stiszoom ] and the arc - like structure , on both the cl and lp images in the following way . for the photometry of the point sources we use daophot  ii .",
    "we determined the psf in the same way as described in   4 of @xcite .",
    "we used allstar @xcite with a fitting radius of @xmath35 and a sky annulus of @xmath36@xmath37 to fit a psf to the object and determined aperture corrections by measuring the magnitudes of several stars in apertures with radii of @xmath38 ( cl ) and @xmath39 ( lp ) .",
    "tables 14.3 and 14.5 of the stis instrument handbook show that these radii correspond to @xmath40% of the encircled energy for a point source .",
    "we used the stis zero points given in @xcite to convert the count rates to cl and lp magnitudes .",
    "we transformed the cl and lp magnitudes to johnson @xmath25 and kron ",
    "cousins @xmath26 magnitudes using the calibrations of @xcite .",
    "they used 33 stars with @xmath41 and found that the rms residuals of their calibrations were @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ stiszoom]b and fig .",
    "[ stiszoom]d all seven objects , including the probably sn remnant in the error ellipse , are well subtracted by the psf .",
    "the results of our psf - photometry are given in table  [ tabphot ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 magnitudes are dominated by the uncertainties in the transformations from cl and lp .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 values are the coordinates on the drizzled stis cl image of each object relative to the sn remnant .",
    "the colours of s2 and s4 are consistent with red giant stars whereas the other four point sources have blue colours consistent with massive main - sequence stars .",
    "we measured the surface brightness of the arc - like structure in the following way .",
    "we subtracted the point sources in table  [ tabphot ] and smoothed the resulting images with a gaussian with a full - width at half - maximum of three pixels .",
    "we then fit - by - eye a line through the arc and measured the mean countrate along this line .",
    "the sky was estimated from empty regions of the cl and lp images .",
    "the results of this procedure are @xmath46 and @xmath47 , yielding @xmath48 .",
    "this structure might be the source of the h@xmath49 emission seen in late spectra of sn1998bw @xcite",
    "grb  980425/sn1998bw occurred in the southern spiral arm of the sub - luminous ( @xmath14 ) , barred sbc galaxy eso  184g82 .",
    "this galaxy is in a stage of strong star formation . in this way",
    "eso  184g82 resembles the lmc , which is also sub - luminous , barred and dominated by regions with strong star formation .",
    "we note that eso  184g82 is @xmath50 as luminous as the lmc . for @xmath51@xmath52",
    "km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 @xcite eso  184g82 has a luminosity of @xmath53@xmath54 .",
    "there are two possible explanations for why eso  184g82 is undergoing strong star formation .",
    "these explanations may be related .",
    "firstly , eso  184g82 has a bar . whereas the presence of a bar in spiral galaxies does not , in general , correlate with the global star formation rate @xcite the bar strength has been found to correlate strongly with the global star formation rate of the galaxy @xcite . secondly , although we only have a measured redshift for eso  184g82 @xcite , the galaxy is probably member of a group of at least five galaxies simply based on the low likelihood of a chance projection .",
    "the nearest neighbour is an sb galaxy at a projected separation of only @xmath55 kpc .",
    "moreover , eso  184g82 shows indications of being morphologically disturbed .",
    "interaction induced star formation is therefore a likely explanation .",
    "the sn occured in a star - forming region with several bright , young stars within a projected distance of @xmath56100 pc . in this respect",
    ", it is similar to most core - collapse sne that typically are located within young stellar associations in spiral arms @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the emission at the position of the sn 778 days after the discovery of the grb is @xmath57 magnitude brighter than one would expect from a simple radioactive decay model @xcite .",
    "the emission in both the cl and lp image is well - fitted by a psf at a position that is consistent with the precise position of the sn determined in   [ astrometry ] .",
    "the residuals remaining after subtracting the scaled psf are consistent with noise .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the observed emission could in fact be from the sn .",
    "we tested our ability to resolve a star cluster in eso  184g82 by adding artificial clusters with michie ",
    "king @xcite profiles and the same flux as the sn remnant to the cl image as described in @xcite .",
    "we found that star clusters with core radii of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 pc ) appeared as extended objects and are not well fit by the psf .",
    "this suggests that , if the sn did occur in a star cluster , the underlying star cluster is either physically very small and thus can not be distinguished from a point source , or that the underlying star cluster is very faint .",
    "if the emission is really dominated by the fading sn , as can only be confirmed by follow - up observations with the _ hst _ , this would imply a significant flattening of the light curve , possibly explained by interaction with circumstellar material or accretion on a black hole @xcite , or the effect of the positron decay @xcite .",
    "these data provide a very solid confirmation of the hypothesis that at least some grbs are strongly related to star formation @xcite .",
    "however , some grbs , such as grb  970508 , show evidence that there was no sn like sn1998bw associated with them . therefore",
    ", either grbs are associated with non - standard - candle sne , or only some grbs are associated with sne and the others have a different progenitor . @xcite",
    "have used bayesian methods to estimate that no more than @xmath60% of the grbs that have been detected by batse were produced by known sne ib  ic .",
    "however , @xcite conservatively estimate the probability that the coincidence between grb  980425 and sn1998bw is chance to be @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that grb980425/sn1998bw was a member of an unusual class of grbs / sne .",
    "grb  980425 had a isotropic - equivalent energy of @xmath62 erg @xcite , making it @xmath63 less energetic than the other grbs for which distances ( and thus isotropic - equivalent energies ) have been determined .",
    "if grb  980425 had occurred at @xmath64 ( the median redshift of the grbs with measured redshifts ) it would not have been detected .",
    "as of 30 june 2000 redshifts and total isotropic energies have been determined for only ten grbs , with nine having energies between @xmath65 erg and @xmath66 erg , and one having an energy of @xmath62 erg .",
    "if we assume that this ratio holds for the entire batse 4b catalogue @xcite then the observed number of high - energy ( @xmath67 erg ) grbs with known redshifts ( nine ) implies that a high - energy grb will occur at @xmath68 only once every @xmath69 years . therefore , it is not surprising that we have not observed any high - energy grbs with @xmath70 .",
    "grbs with isotropic - equivalent energies of @xmath71 may be common at @xmath72 , but are undetectable with current instruments .",
