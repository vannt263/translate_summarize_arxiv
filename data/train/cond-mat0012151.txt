    "high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) are characterized by a wide temperature range in which fluctuations are important @xcite .",
    "this range  is proportional to the ginzburg parameter @xmath12 , which is very sensitive both to the dimensionality @xmath13  of the system and to the superconducting coherence length @xmath14 .",
    "thus , strong fluctuations , usually negligible in conventional superconductors , become extremely important due to the small @xmath14  and quasi two - dimensional structure .",
    "a useful tool in the analysis of the nature of critical fluctuation is the dimensionality dependent scaling of the magnetization @xmath15 versus temperature @xmath16 for various @xmath17 magnetic fields @xmath18 @xcite in part of the phase diagram that is  not very far  from @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the scaled magnetization @xmath20 is plotted versus the scaled temperature @xmath21 and all isochamps are predicted to collapse onto a single curve according to a dimensionality of the system @xcite .",
    "once such a scaling is found , the  fluctuation ",
    "dimensionality @xmath13 can be determined . in @xmath8 systems",
    "the relative contribution of the fluctuations to the magnetization is much larger than in @xmath10 systems .",
    "experimentally , the scaling approach has been widely employed to study the highly anisotropic , quasi @xmath8 , @xmath22 @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite , where two - dimensional scaling was shown to work very well .",
    "the same @xmath8 scaling seems to work also for @xmath25 @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath23 @xcite , and for @xmath27 @xmath28@xcite , @xmath29 @xcite , and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the contribution of fluctuations to the magnetization is also borne out in the experiment as a crossing point of all isochamps at a temperature @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "at this temperature @xmath15 is independent of @xmath18 for a large range of fields .",
    "this feature was previously observed experimentally in @xmath8 systems where @xmath8 scaling was expected @xcite .",
    "theoretically there is evidence that in both 2d and 3d the intersection is not perfect , the intersection points however are very close to each other , especially in @xmath8 @xcite . though most hts are either @xmath8  or @xmath10  materials , there is , in principle , a possibility that both @xmath10  and @xmath8  behaviors would be measured at the same sample , depending on magnetic field and temperature .",
    "such @xmath8 to @xmath10 crossover in vortex fluctuations is expected for highly anisotropic superconductors , at high temperatures , simply because the coherence length @xmath14 diverges as @xmath16 approaches the transition temperature @xmath32 .",
    "an evidence for a temperature induced crossover was found in magnetization measurements in @xmath33@xcite . another possible experimental approach to study the @xmath34 crossover",
    "may be based on the expected change in the anisotropy caused by changing the oxygen content in @xmath35 . in this system ,",
    "the anisotropy increases with the decrease in the oxygen content .",
    "indeed , a @xmath10 scaling was observed in a fully oxygenated @xmath36single crystal @xcite , but a @xmath8 scaling was demonstrated @xcite in @xmath37 .    in the present work",
    "we establish , experimentally and theoretically , the existence of a @xmath8 to @xmath10 crossover in the nature of fluctuations in a high @xmath32 superconductor .",
    "specifically , in the oxygen deficient @xmath0 @xmath38 single crystal , at high fields ( above @xmath39 ) , the magnetization isochamps intersect at one temperature @xmath40 ( fig.1 ) and exhibit a @xmath8 type of scaling .",
    "however , at the lower fields we find another , somewhat smeared , crossing point at @xmath41 ( fig.2 ) , and the magnetization exhibits a @xmath10 scaling .",
    "the presence of two intersection points , as well as @xmath8 and @xmath10 scaling of magnetization in different field regimes , are the new experimental points in this work .",
    "if one defines a field dependent  intersection point  as an intersection of two lines for close magnetic fields , one observes that as field is lowered , the intersection point first  sits  at @xmath42 , than jumps quickly to @xmath43 and nearly stops there .",

    "diagram resummation analogous to that established earlier in the @xmath8 and @xmath10 limiting cases @xcite .",
