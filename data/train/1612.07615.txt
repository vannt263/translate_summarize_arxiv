    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc hereafter ) @xcite , a theory attempting to describe the quantum gravitational nature of the early universe , presents several noteworthy features .",
    "first , it leads in a robust way to a resolution of the big - bang singularity in a wide variety of cosmological models @xcite , and provides , away from the quantum gravity regime , corrections of order @xmath0 to the standard ( e.g. friedmann ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "second , it allows for a consistent extension of the framework of cosmological perturbation theory and inflationary physics all the way down to the plank regime @xcite , and has provided predictions which should be compared to experimental results in the near future @xcite . finally , it has its roots in a full theory of quantum gravity , namely loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite .",
    "although lqc was originally introduced as a minisuperspace quantization , where one imports by hand the key features and technical inputs coming from lqg ( such as the existence of an area gap and the representation of the holonomy - flux algebra ) , lots of recent work has been devoted to identifying a cosmological sector within the full theory , i.e. to properly deriving lqc from ( or embedding lqc into ) lqg @xcite . in parallel to this , there have also been several advancements on conceptual and technical issues regarding the construction of the continuum limit of lqg and related discrete approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "this includes the coarse graining of spin foam models and spin networks @xcite , and the study of group field theory ( gft ) renormalization @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has recently been shown within gft that the effective dynamics of condensate states describing the collective behavior of microscopic geometrical degrees of freedom is that of a bouncing cosmological model @xcite .",
    "gft being a second quantization of lqg @xcite , this results evidently begs the question of the relationship between lqc and the cosmological sector of gft .    in any attempt to embed lqc within lqg , or to connect it to gft",
    ", one should understand the role played by possible quantization and regularization ambiguities . in lqc",
    ", one such ambiguity appears due to the necessity of choosing a representation of @xmath1 , labelled by a half - integer spin @xmath2 , in which to express group elements such as the holonomies , and in which to evaluate the traces defining various quantities like the non - local curvature of the connection expressed in terms these holonomies .",
    "the usual choice made in the literature is to work in the fundamental representation of spin @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , states in lqc are always chosen to be as fine grained as possible , i.e. as being made up of a collection of quanta of geometry each carrying an excitation of spin @xmath3 ( i.e. the smallest possible area or volume ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the situation in the full theory , where the dynamics ( i.e. the hamiltonian constraint or the spin foam amplitudes ) and the states both depend on spin labels . in the study of quantum cosmology via gft condensates on the other hand , it has been shown that the dynamics selects a low spin regime , and that the lqc states with spin @xmath3 are dominant while higher spin contributions are exponentially suppressed @xcite .",
    "the issue of the spin ambiguity in the regularization of the hamiltonian constraint of lqc has previously been addressed in @xcite ( and also in @xcite in the context of three - dimensional gravity ) , with differences which we will explain below . in these articles , the formulas obtained by the authors are rather involved . to understand the reason for this ,",
    "let us recall that the regularization of the hamiltonian constraint typically requires to write the curvature of the connection in terms of holonomies of this latter around a square plaquette , and then to shrink the area enclosed by this plaquette to a non - zero value given by the area gap of lqg .",
    "the existence of this area gap ( i.e. the impossibility of taking the limit of vanishing area ) is the reason for which the resulting expression for the curvature is non - local and depends on the representation label @xmath2 in which the holonomies and the trace are computed . in @xcite , this is done by computing explicitly the trace in a representation of spin @xmath2 of group elements expressed in this same representation , which gives rise to the above - mentioned complicated formulas .",
    "however , the computation in a representation of spin @xmath2 of the trace of an @xmath1 group element does not require the `` full information '' about this latter ( i.e. the explicit knowledge of all its matrix elements ) , and can be reduced to an expression involving only the trace in the representation of spin @xmath3 ( i.e. the fundamental representation ) and the class angle .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this simple fact can be used to drastically simplify the expression for the regularized hamiltonian constraint in lqc with an arbitrary spin representation .",
    "this is the main technical feature which we exploit in this note .",
    "in addition to this technical simplification , the improvement which we obtain over @xcite also consists in writing in a unified fashion the hamiltonian constraint operator using the two different regularization schemes which are available in flrw models for the curvature of the connection , using respectively the holonomies or the connection itself .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to these regularizations as the holonomy and curvature regularizations , and denote them by hr and cr respectively .",
    "also , our construction takes into account the so - called inverse - volume corrections .",
    "these results are summarized in formula , which is the expression for the total quantum hamiltonian constraint operator ( with a massless scalar field ) taking into account the inverse - volume corrections , the two possible choices hr and cr of regularization for the curvature , and an arbitrary choice of @xmath1 representation .",
    "one of the consequences of considering a representation of spin @xmath4 is the obtention of a difference evolution equation for the quantum states which is of higher order in the step size ( as compared to the case @xmath5 . in @xcite ,",
    "a stability analysis ( following the criteria of @xcite ) of this higher order difference equation has been performed in the case @xmath6 and hr , and has shown that the quantum theory admits spurious solutions which could spoil its semi - classical limit .",
    "in the present note , we are able to show that the choices @xmath4 also fail this stability criterion for the regularization hr , while for the regularization cr only the choices @xmath7 lead to spurious solutions . in addition , the explicit expression for the regularized hamiltonian constraint and the corresponding classical effective equations of motion show that the regularizations hr and cr do not match for @xmath4 ( while for @xmath3 they can be made to agree by rescaling the parameter @xmath8 entering the regularization ) .",
    "interestingly , when considering a representation @xmath4 some peculiarities already appear at the classical level . indeed , following what is usually done in the case @xmath3 ,",
    "it is possible to view the regularized hamiltonian constraint as a heuristic effective classical hamiltonian incorporating holonomy corrections , and then derive effective evolution equations for various physical quantities ( such as the hubble parameter , the energy density , or the volume ) . by computing the evolution of the matter density as a function of the hubble parameter , we find that for @xmath9 and @xmath10 the density becomes negative during its evolution .",
    "this means that the corresponding heuristic hamiltonian constraints do not describe proper semi - classical flrw dynamics . at first",
    ", one could think that this is the manifestation at the classical level of the fact that there exist spurious unstable solutions in the quantum theory .",
    "however , the analysis of extended hamiltonian constraints which take into account the presence of multiple spins shows that this relation is not straightforward . as we will show , it is possible to consider arbitrary linear combinations of hamiltonian constraints which are regularized with different @xmath1 representations .",
    "if one sums an arbitrary number of successive hamiltonians with spins starting from @xmath3 , for a very generic class of weights the resulting evolution equations lead to a bouncing flrw behavior .",
    "interestingly , if the weights assigned to higher spins are not decreasing fast enough , the critical density at which the bounce occurs tends to zero . on the other hand , for weights which are decreasing sufficiently fast ( typically exponentially ) , as the number of allowed spins is increased the critical density converges towards a value which is always lower than the usual @xmath3 value @xmath11 .",
    "however , in spite of the density remaining positive as a function of the hubble rate when one considers the contribution of several spins , the corresponding quantum hamiltonian constraint still admits spurious solutions .",
    "this shows that there is indeed no a priori relation between the peculiar behavior of the heuristic classical equations and the existence of spurious solutions in the quantum theory .",
    "it is interesting to note however that the relationship between the lowering of the critical density and the inclusion of exponentially suppressed spins @xmath4 is reminiscent of what has been observed in cosmological applications of gft @xcite .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we briefly review the construction of flat flrw lqc and its effective dynamics in the case @xmath3 .",
    "this is the occasion of introducing the various notations used throughout the rest of this work , and will serve as a comparison with the case of higher representation labels . in section [ sec:3 ] , we construct the two different regularizations hr and cr of the curvature operator for higher spins . in section [ sec:4 ] , we study the heuristic classical equations of motion which are obtained by considering the regularized hamiltonian as a classical constraint . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we incorporate the inverse - volume corrections , and finally in section [ sec:6 ] we briefly comment on the quantum theory .",
    "in order to make this article self - contained and to set some standard notations and conventions , we briefly review in this section some well - known features about flat , homogeneous , and isotropic lqc .",
    "the reader already familiar with lqc can safely skip this part and jump to section [ sec:3 ] .    in the @xmath1 ashtekar  barbero formulation of first order gravity",
    ", the action takes the @xmath12 hamiltonian form s[e^a_i , a^i_a , n , n^a , a^i_0]=_t_^3x(e^a_i_0a^i_a - nc_-n^ac_a - a^i_0g_i ) . here ,",
    "and in the rest is this work , we use @xmath13 to denote spatial indices and @xmath14 to denote @xmath15 lie algebra indices .",
    "the canonical phase space variables are the connection and the densitized triad , whose explicit expression is given respectively by a^i_a^i_a+k^i_a , e^a_i(e^i_a)e^a_i=^abc_ijke^j_be^k_c , and these variables obey the poisson bracket relation [ ae poisson ] a^i_a(x),e^b_j(y)=^i_j^b_a^3(x , y ) . here",
    "@xmath16 is the levi  civita spin connection , @xmath17 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the barbero  immirzi parameter . as usual",
    ", the total hamiltonian is the sum of the scalar , vector , and gauss constraints , which are enforced respectively by the lapse @xmath20 , the shift vector @xmath21 , and the connection component @xmath22 . upon imposition of the cosmological symmetries ( i.e. homogeneity and isotropy )",
    ", only the scalar constraint will be non - vanishing .",
    "for our purposes , it is therefore sufficient to only focus on the explicit expression of the ( spatially - integrated ) scalar constraint , which is given by [ full scalar constraint ] _ ^n_^3xnc_=_^3xnq^-1/2e^a_ie^b_j(^ij_kf^k_ab-2(1+^2)k^i_[ak^j_b ] ) , where @xmath23 is the square root of the determinant of the spatial metric .",
    "since we are going to work later on with different choices for the lapse @xmath20 , we have indicated in @xmath24 an explicit dependency on @xmath20 in order to keep track of which choice has been made .",
    "we are now going to restrict ourselves to a spatially flat , homogeneous , and isotropic spacetime , i.e. to a flat flrw cosmological model . in this case",
    ", the line element in comoving coordinates @xmath25 takes the form s^2=-t^2+q_abx^ax^b",
    "=- t^2+a^2(x^2+y^2+z^2)=-t^2+a^2_abx^ax^b , where @xmath26 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath27 is the proper time along the worldlines of observers moving in a direction orthogonal to that of the spatial slices . in this expression",
    ", @xmath28 is the physical metric of the homogeneous spatial slices @xmath29 , and for later purposes we have used the comoving coordinates to define a fiducial flat background metric _ abx^ax^b = x^2+y^2+z^2,_ab=^i_a^j_b_ij , where @xmath30 is a fixed fiducial cotriad .",
    "the physical spatial three - dimensional metric is related to this fiducial metric through the scale factor by @xmath31 .",
    "as we shall see later on , it turns out to be useful in lqc to work with the harmonic time coordinate @xmath32 , which is such that @xmath33 , and in terms of which the line element takes the form s^2=-a^6",
    "^ 2+q_abx^ax^b .",
    "this choice corresponds in fact to setting the lapse , defined via @xmath34 , to @xmath35 .    in flat flrw cosmology",
    ", the topology of the spatial manifold @xmath29 can be chosen to be either that of a three - torus , or that of @xmath36 .",
    "let us focus here on the case @xmath37 . since the spatial manifold is then non - compact , all spatial integrals are divergent , and the lagrangian , the hamiltonian , and the symplectic structure are a priori ill - defined .",
    "this can easily be dealt with by restricting all spatial integrations to a fixed fiducial cell @xmath38 , which we can choose to be cubical with respect to every physical metric @xmath28 on @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely , using the cell @xmath38 as a regulator for the spatial integrals means that we have to proceed to the substitution _",
    "we will denote the fiducial volume of this cell , defined as the volume measured with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath39 , by _",
    "^3x^1/2 , where @xmath40 .",
    "note that there is always a freedom in rescaling the fiducial metric and the scale factor as @xmath41 , as well a freedom in rescaling the cell as @xmath42 .",
    "since this freedom can not be gauged away ( unlike in the case of positive or negative spatial curvature , where one can choose a unit metric on @xmath29 ) , one has to remember that the scale factor @xmath43 has no direct physical meaning",
    ". only ratios of scale factors do carry a physical interpretation .",
    "now that we have appropriately regularized the infinite volume of the spatial manifold , we are ready to see how the cosmological symmetries affect the phase space variables of the theory .",
    "isotropic connections and densitized triads are characterized by a^i_a=^i_ac^-1/3^i_a , e^a_i=^1/2^a_ip^1/2 ^ -2/3^a_i , where @xmath44 the fiducial triad adapted to the edges of @xmath38 . here",
    "we have used the freedom in redefining the fiducial metric in order to rescale the symmetry - reduced variables as @xmath45 .",
    "this ensures that the resulting symmetry - reduced poisson bracket will be independent of @xmath39 and @xmath38 . with these new cosmological variables",
    ", the poisson bracket reduces to c , p=. as a remark , let us point out that although the symplectic structure and the scalar constraint will turn out to be independent of the choice of fiducial metric @xmath39 , they will still both carry a hidden dependency on the choice of fiducial cell .    the dynamics of lqc is usually formulated in terms of the above symmetry - reduced connection and triad variables .",
    "however , it will also be helpful later on to use the variables [ b and v variables ] bc|p|^-1/2,|p|^3/2 , which satisfy the poisson bracket b,=. it is also informative to relate these variables to the scale factor .",
    "the relation between the scale factor and the above variables is as follows involve the dynamics , i.e. the time evolution of @xmath43 , these relations are only true in the classical hamiltonian framework , and simply express the fact that we are free to work with the phase space variables @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "as we will see later on , these relations are modified in lqc ( whether it is in the full quantum theory or at the level of the effective classical equations ) since the dynamics is then different . ] : c=^1/3,|p|=a^2 ^ 2/3,b= , where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to proper ( or cosmic ) time @xmath27 .",
    "we therefore see that @xmath49 measures the physical area of each rectangular face of the cell @xmath38 , while @xmath50 is proportional to the hubble rate .",
    "note that we also have the relations q^1/2=a^3",
    "^ 1/2=|p|^3/2 ^ -1 ^ 1/2 , and that we can therefore express the physical volume of @xmath38 as v = a^3=_^3xq^1/2=|p|^3/2 .",
    "finally , note that we can express the physical triad and cotriad as e^a_i=(p)|p|^-1/2 ^ 1/3^a_i , e^i_a=(p)|p|^1/2 ^ -1/3^i_a .",
    "the variable @xmath49 can be either positive or negative , which corresponds to the two possible choices of orientation for the triad .",
    "since the metric is left unchanged under the transformation @xmath51 and we will not consider the coupling to fermions , the physics will also be left unchanged by this transformation .",
    "thus , this orientation reversal of the triad represents a gauge transformation which has to be dealt with in the quantum theory .",
    "we can now focus on the scalar constraint of the theory . because the model that we describe is spatially flat , the spin connection @xmath16 vanishes and we have @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , because of spatial homogeneity , the derivatives of @xmath17 do also vanish and we have that 2k^i_[ak^j_b]=_kf^k_ab . with this",
    ", we find that the gravitational part of the scalar constraint can be expressed as [ reduced gravitational hamiltonian ] _ ^n =- n|p|^1/2 ^ 2/3^a_i^b_j^ij_kf^k_ab =- n|p|^1/2c^2 , where we have written the intermediate expression for later use , as well as an explicit dependency on the lapse .",
    "the simplest type of matter coupling which we could consider is the addition of a free massless scalar field .",
    "the contribution of such a matter sector to the scalar constraint is given by [ matter hamiltonian ] _",
    "^n=_^3xnq^1/2 ^ 2=n|p|^3/2 ^ 2=n|p|^-3/2p_^2 , where the momentum conjugate to the scalar field is @xmath53 , and we have @xmath54 . in summary , the total scalar constraint ( which is in fact the total hamiltonian of the symmetry - reduced cosmological model ) takes the form ^n_^n+_^n = n(-|p|^1/2c^2+|p|^-3/2p_^2 ) , in order to go back to more conventional variables , we can reintroduce the scale factor along with its momentum @xmath55 , and use @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to ^n = n(-+ ) .",
    "when the lapse is chosen to be @xmath58 , the evolution in proper time is given by @xmath59 , and one can check that the equation @xmath60 , together with the vanishing of the hamiltonian constraint , leads to the friedmann equation -=()^2= , where [ classical density ] |p|^-3p_^2=^2 is the energy density of the scalar field .",
    "so far , we have defined the hamiltonian dynamics of the symmetry - reduced variables . however , in lqg and lqc the connection can not be associated to a well - defined operator in the quantum theory , and one has to rewrite the constraint in terms of the holonomies of the connection , which are the only well - defined operators .",
    "in particular , one has to proceed to a holonomy regularization of the curvature operator @xmath61 .",
    "this is precisely the step which depends on the choice of spin representation .",
    "recasting the hamiltonian constraint in a form which is suited for quantization via the techniques of lqg requires essentially two steps .",
    "the first one is to regularize the curvature of the connection in terms of the holonomies of this latter , and the second one is to appropriately deal with the presence of an inverse power of the determinant of the triad .",
    "the first step leads to the so - called holonomy corrections , while the second one , when carried out using thiemann s trick , leads to the so - called inverse - volume corrections .",
    "it is however known that the quantum gravity effects which are responsible for the resolution of the singularity in lqc can `` mostly '' be traced back to the holonomy corrections , while the inverse - volume corrections only play an auxiliary role .",
    "therefore , as a simplification which will however enable us to encode the relevant physics , let us get rid of the inverse determinant of the triad in the hamiltonian constraint by simply going to the harmonic gauge , i.e. by choosing represents the physical area of the faces of the cell @xmath38 , it is independent of the coordinates and transforms as a scalar . on the other hand , @xmath62 is a scalar density of weight one because of the coordinate - dependent factors . since @xmath20 is itself a scalar , this explains why in lqc it is possible and meaningful to choose @xmath63 , while in the full theory it is not possible to choose @xmath64 . ]",
    "the lapse to be @xmath63 .    in the harmonic gauge , which we denote by using the superscript `` h '' in the scalar constraint ,",
    "the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint becomes [ harmonic gauge gravitational hamiltonian ] _",
    "^=-|p|^2 ^ 2/3^a_i^b_j^ij_kf^k_ab .",
    "the first step towards regularizing the curvature of the connection is to compute the holonomies of this latter . for this , let us consider an edge aligned with the direction of @xmath65 , and of fiducial length @xmath66 . in the fundamental representation of dimension @xmath67 ( i.e. of spin @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the holonomy of the connection along this edge is given by h_i^^()=_0^^1/3a^i_a_ix^a=(c_i)=()+2()_i , where @xmath68 enables us to choose between the holonomy along the edge @xmath69 and its inverse , and @xmath70 is a generator of @xmath15 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) . in what follows",
    ", we will denote by @xmath71 the inverse of the group element @xmath72 .",
    "now , we can introduce the holonomy of the connection around a square plaquette @xmath73 perpendicular to @xmath74 and of fiducial area @xmath75 .",
    "this is given by h__ij^()=h_i^()h_j^()h_i^-1^()h_j^-1^ ( ) . in terms of this plaquette holonomy , we can then write the following standard expression for the curvature : f^k_ab & = _ _ 0(^k)^i_a^j_b + & = _ 0(h__ij^()^k)^i_a^j_b , where the trace is taken in the representation of dimension @xmath67 with the normalization factor . in the second line",
    ", we have simply used the fact that , by definition , the generators of the lie algebra @xmath15 have vanishing trace , and used the expression for the area of the plaquette in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath76 .    at this point , the crucial input from the full theory is to realize that this limit is in fact not well - defined . physically speaking , this is due to the presence of a minimal non - zero eigenvalue for the area operator , which implies that one can only shrink @xmath77 down to the so - called area gap of lqg ( which , as explained in the next subsection , is proportional to @xmath78 ) . in mathematical terms",
    ", this non - existence of the limit is due to the fact that the basic phase space functions , namely the holonomies of the connection @xmath79 , are not weakly - continuous with respect to the parameter @xmath8 measuring the edge length . at this point , we are therefore going to approximate the curvature by f^k_ab-(h__ij^()^k)^i_a^j_b , and the explicit relation between the parameter @xmath8 and the area gap will be given later on .",
    "now , using the explicit expression [ plaquette holo ] h__ij^()=((c)+^2(c))+^2(c)_ij^k_k+2 ^ 2()(c)(_i-_j ) , one finds ( h__ij^()^k)=-^2(c)_ij^k , and the scalar constraint in the harmonic gauge finally becomes [ regularized constraint in d=2 ] ^(2)_^=-|p|^2 ^ 2(c ) .",
    "here we have added a superscript @xmath80 in order to remember that this expression has been obtained by regularizing the curvature operator in the representation of dimension @xmath67 .",
    "this expression is the ( simplest ) regularized version of the hamiltonian constraint which is used in lqc .",
    "it is written in terms of quantities which are all well - defined on the kinematical hilbert space of the theory , and , modulo a choice of factor ordering , one can therefore go on to the study of the physical states and the quantum dynamics .    now , one last subtlety is to determine an explicit expression for the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "again , this is done by importing ingredients from the full theory .",
    "consider one of the square faces defining the boundary of the cubical cell @xmath38 . assuming that this face is pierced transversally by @xmath20 spin network links carrying the minimal possible spin label , i.e. @xmath3 ( which corresponds to the best possible coarse - grained homogeneity )",
    ", one can subdivide the face into @xmath20 identical cells which are each pierced by a single spin network link .",
    "each of these elementary cells carries an area determined by the area gap of lqg , namely [ lambda ] ^24 ^ 2 , which is the smallest non - vanishing eigenvalue of the area spectrum a(j)==8 ^ 2=4 ^ 2 .",
    "therefore , the face has a total physical area given by |p|=n^2 . on the other hand , recall that the parameter measuring the length of the edges of each elementary cell is @xmath8 . in terms of the fiducial metric",
    ", each cell has an area @xmath81 .",
    "since the total fiducial area of the face is @xmath82 , we get the equality n^2",
    "^ 2/3=^2/3 . putting this together with the previous equation we finally obtain the relation ^2|p|=^2 , or in other words @xmath83 .",
    "this shows that @xmath8 contains in fact a non - trivial dependency on the dynamical variables .",
    "the effective framework of lqc is a classical hamiltonian dynamics which encodes the leading order contributions from the quantum gravity effects . rigorously speaking ,",
    "this effective dynamics has to be extracted from the quantum dynamics by taking an appropriate semi - classical limit and using coherent states .",
    "one simpler and heuristic way to proceed is simply to consider the expression coming from the regularization of the curvature instead of the original scalar constraint .",
    "this fact is , however , a particularity of flat flrw models , and does not hold in general ( we thank edward wilson - ewing for bringing this to our attention ) . ] .    in order to derive the effective friedmann equation ,",
    "let us work with proper time , i.e. with a lapse @xmath58 , and consider the heuristic modification of the hamiltonian constraint given by ^(2)^1=^(2)^1_+^1_=-|p|^1/2 ^ 2(c)+|p|^3/2 .",
    "one can then compute the equation of motion = p,^(2)^1=|p|^1/2(c)(c ) , which in turn leads to ( ) ^2=()^2=|p|^-1 ^ 2(c)^2(c)=|p|^-1 ^ 2(c)(1-^2(c ) ) .",
    "finally , using the vanishing of the effective hamiltonian constraint , we get the modified friedmann equation h^2=()^2=(1- ) , where the critical density is given by [ critical density ] _",

    "] , one finds a value for the critical density which is @xmath11 .",
    "in this section , we present the two regularizations of the curvature operator for arbitrary @xmath1 representations . following @xcite , we denote these two regularization schemes by hr ( for holonomy regularization ) and cr ( for connection regularization ) .",
    "as we will see , the resulting regularized curvature operators in these two cases can be written in the exact same form , and the information about the regularization scheme is simply contained in the class angle of a certain @xmath1 group element .",
    "the holonomy regularization is the one which we have used in the previous section in the case @xmath67 .",
    "we explain here how the simple formula of appendix [ appendixa ] can be used to generalize this result to the case @xmath86 . to compute the curvature ,",
    "one considers again a square plaquette @xmath73 perpendicular to the direction of @xmath74 , with edges of coordinate length @xmath66 , and of area @xmath75",

    ", one can rewrite the trace in using the strategy explained in appendix [ appendixa ] and summarized in formula .    for this",
    ", we first need to compute the trace in the fundamental representation .",
    "this has already been done above using , and one simply has that ( h^()__ij^k)=-^2(c)_ij^k .",
    "formula then leads to _",
    "( d)(h^()__ij^k)=()_ij^k , where the class angle , most easily computed in the fundamental representation , is given by [ class angle 1 ] = ( ( h^()__ij))=((c)+^2(c ) ) . putting this together with",

    ", we obtain ^2_=^2(_+8 + 4_+4 - 10 + 4_-4+_-8 ) .",
    "now , even though we are summing the two cases discussed above which passed the stability criterion , namely @xmath176 and @xmath171 , we obtain a quantum theory which fails the stability criterion .",
    "although we do not push the study of the quantum theory further , it would be very interesting to understand more precisely the relationship between the sign of the energy density and the stability criterion of @xcite , and to understand how the spurious solutions could be regulated with the proper construction of the physical inner product .",
    "it seems that this is a crucial condition if one wishes to define properly lqc with higher spin representations and establish a connection with the full theory .",
    "since the manipulation of classical expressions does not commute with the quantization process , one can naturally expect to obtain different quantum theories for different choices of lapse ( and of orderings ) when the vanishing of the total hamiltonian is applied as a quantum constraint . in the previous section ,",
    "we have studied the construction of the quantum theory using the harmonic time gauge , i.e. with the choice of lapse @xmath63 . however , in order to mimic more closely the features of the full theory , where the choice of the harmonic time gauge is not viable ( see footnote 2 ) , one can also choose to work with the proper time gauge , i.e. with @xmath58 .",
    "this then leads to the appearance of the so - called inverse - volume corrections .",
    "more precisely , when working with the proper time as opposed to the harmonic time , different powers of the volume @xmath177 appear in the total hamiltonian constraint .",
    "first , as can be seen on , the hamiltonian for a massless scalar field contains the inverse - volume contribution @xmath178 . using thiemann s trick ,",
    "this contribution can be rewritten ( or rather regularized ) classically as [ classical inverse - volume ] ^(d , r)v^-1=^3/[2(1-r ) ] . using the fact that h_i^()h_i^-1^(),v^2r/3=-c , v^2r/3_i=-|p|^r-1_i , together with the normalization _ ( d)(_i^i)=3(d ) ,",
    "one finds indeed that reduces to @xmath179 . without computing the poisson bracket classically , and simply turning the right - hand side of into a quantum operator instead",
    ", one obtains an expression for the inverse - volume operator @xmath180 which depends on the two regularization ambiguities @xmath134 and @xmath181 . in the literature ,",
    "it is customary to use the values @xmath182 or @xmath183 .",
    "note that there exist additional ambiguities in the definition of the inverse - volume operator , as explained in section iv.a of @xcite , but we do not consider them here .",
    "next , one has to look at how the choice @xmath58 modifies the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the simplest possibility is to consider the first term in , which is written in terms of classical quantities that all posses well - defined quantum analogues ( at the difference with the second term , which should be written using the above inverse - volume formula ) .",
    "however , in order to mimic more closely and the full theory , it is common to also use thiemann s trick to rewrite the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "more precisely , one can use the scheme hr combined with thiemann s trick to write [ i.v .",
    "gravitational hamiltonian 1 ] _",
    "^1=^ijk_(d)(h^()__ijh_k^()h_k^-1^(),v ) .",
    "alternatively , one can use the scheme cr together with thiemann s trick to write [ i.v .",
    "gravitational hamiltonian 2 ] _ ^1=^ijk_(d)(h_k^(2)h_k^-1^(2),v ) . when expanding the holonomies in powers of @xmath8 and taking the limit @xmath90",
    ", one can indeed check that these two expressions lead to with @xmath58 .    to go to the quantum theory",
    ", one should now take either of these expressions , turn the holonomies and the volume into quantum operators , and replace the poisson bracket by a commutator",
    ". however , one then runs into the problem that formula can not be used in order to evaluate the trace in an arbitrary representation of dimension @xmath134 .",
    "this is because in the quantum theory , once the poisson bracket has been replaced by a commutator , this trace is not anymore that of a lie algebra element multiplied by a group element ( which would have been the case if the poisson bracket had been computed classically and the volume factor taken out of the trace ) .",
    "one alternative way of evaluating the traces in and is of course to go back to the formulas of @xcite , but this would render useless the simplifications which have been obtained in section [ sec:3 ] for the regularization of the curvature .",
    "it is therefore convenient at this point to separate the contributions from the regularized curvature and inverse - volume term .",
    "indeed , this latter can be written as q^-1/2e^a_ie^b_j^ij_k=-_(d)(h_l^()h_l^-1^(),v_k)^ijl^a_i^b_j^1/2 , which , when combined with the expression @xmath184 for the regularized curvature , leads to the following expression for the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint : [ i.v .",

    "^1=_(d)(h_i^()h_i^-1^(),v^i)^2(c)_d ( ) . this expression is valid for the two regularization schemes hr and cr ( since it depends on the choice of angle @xmath94 ) , and one can check that in the limit @xmath90 it leads back to with @xmath58 .",
    "we are therefore left with the task of evaluating the traces in the quantum versions of and , which are obtained by replacing @xmath185/(\\i\\hbar)$ ] and turning the holonomies and the volume into quantum operators . using gauge invariance",
    ", we can write _ ( d)(_i^()^i)=3_(d)(_3^()_3 ) , where we have left the power of the volume unspecified for generality .",
    "now , this trace can easily be computed using the fact that it involves diagonal matrices .",
    "more precisely , for the holonomies we have ( _ 3^())_mn=_mn , for the commutator term we have ( _ 3^())_mn=(^-^)_mn , and for the third generator of @xmath15 we have ( _ 3)_mn = im_mn , with everywhere @xmath186 . putting this together , and switching back to the @xmath48 representation , we obtain the following expression for the gravitational part of the constraint operator : _ ^1=||(_m =- j^jm(||-||))_d ( ) . notice that here we have made a choice of operator ordering similar to that of the previous section , namely with the volume factors on the left .",
    "finally , for the inverse - volume operator we obtain ^(d , r)^-1=^3/[2(1-r ) ] .",
    "this operator has a very simple diagonal action on states , @xmath187 , where the eigenvalues are given by ^(d , r)b()^3/[2(1-r ) ] . with this , the vanishing of the total hamiltonian constraint operator finally leads to [ final formula ] ^2_(,)=_^1 ( , ) .",
    "this expression is valid for the two regularization schemes hr and cr , and takes into account arbitrary representations as well as the inverse - volume corrections .",
    "in this paper , we have pushed further the attempts made in @xcite to regularize the hamiltonian constraint of ( flat flrw ) lqc with arbitrary spin representations .",
    "we have seen that the use of the trace formula together with its rewriting via provides an extremely efficient way of bypassing the complicated results of @xcite , and leads to an expression which can be applied to various regularization schemes for the curvature . as a consequence of this result",
    ", we can anticipate that the extension to more complicated cosmological models ( including for example spatial curvature or anisotropies ) will be rather straightforward .",
    "indeed , we have seen that the extension of any model of lqc from @xmath3 to @xmath4 involves using the results of the regularization for @xmath3 together with the formulas and .",
    "there is therefore a systematic construction for which all the ingredients are now known .    in the lqc literature",
    ", lots of attention has been devoted to so - called higher order holonomy corrections @xcite .",
    "these arise as higher order terms in powers of @xmath8 , which have been neglected when dropping the limit @xmath90 in the expression for the regularized curvature . in @xcite",
    ", it has been suggested that there could be a relationship between these higher order holonomy corrections and the contribution of higher spins representations .",
    "our analysis of the effective dynamics carried out in section [ sec:4 ] seems to indicate that these two type of effects have actually very different consequences .",
    "indeed , in @xcite ( see equation ( 4.44 ) ) it has been shown that the inclusion of higher order holonomy corrections increases the critical density ( as the order of the corrections is itself increased ) , while our analysis shows that the inclusion of more spin representations in the dynamics has the effect of lowering the critical density ( as can be seen on figure [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "there are three interesting directions in which this work could be extended .",
    "first , one should construct rigorously the quantum theory corresponding to higher spin representations , and clarify the status of the spurious solutions which have been identified in @xcite and in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "second , it would be interesting to see if the higher spin representations could have any phenomenological implications , in the spirit of what has been done in @xcite for the higher order holonomy corrections . finally , we hope that the results presented in this note will help clarify the relationship between lqc and gft / full lqg .",
