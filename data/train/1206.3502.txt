    "it follows that @xmath304 and we have the orbital instability of solitary waves .",
    "following the same argument , we can prove theorem [ thm : main3 ] .",
    "when @xmath305 $ ] , from theorem [ thm : hessian_d_12 ] , @xmath74<0 $ ] for admissible @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , @xmath262 has one positive eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue ; @xmath300 . by theorem",
    "[ thm : spectral_h ] , @xmath296 .",
    "hence @xmath301 and the solitary waves are orbital stable .",
    "we have explored the stability and instability of solitons for a generalized derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation . we have found that for @xmath48 , all solitons are orbital unstable . using a numerical calculation of the function @xmath286 defined in .",
    "we have also shown that for @xmath306 , all solitons are orbital stable . for @xmath307 , our computation of @xmath286 indicates there exist both stable and unstable solitons , depending on the values of @xmath37 and @xmath36 . in particular , for fixed @xmath37 and @xmath308 , there are always both stable and unstable solitons for properly selected @xmath36 . for @xmath35",
    "near 1 , the unstable solitons are always rightward moving , but , as figure [ f : fcurves ] shows , the root , @xmath57 , becomes negative as @xmath35 approaches 2 .",
    "once @xmath309 , unstable solitons can be both rightward and leftward moving .",
    "other dispersive pdes possessing both stable and unstable solitons , such as nls and kdv with saturating nonlinearities , @xcite , achieve this by introducing a nonlinearity that breaks scaling .",
    "in contrast , gdnls always has a scaling symmetry , and throughout the regime @xmath310 , the scaling is @xmath61 supercritical .",
    "this also implies the existence of an entire manifold of _ critical _ solitons , precisely when @xmath311 . along this curve ,",
    "the standard stability results of @xcite , break down , and a more detailed analysis is required . in @xcite , the stability can be demonstrated in this degenerate case provided @xmath66 remains convex .",
    "given that within any neighborhood of a critical soliton there exist unstable solitons , we conjecture that it is unstable . while there has been recent work on critical one parameter solitons for nls type equations , @xcite , to the best our knowledge , there has not been an analogous work on two parameter solitons .",
    "while the equation retains the scaling symmetry , we observe that , in contrast to nls solitons , not all gdnls solitons can be obtained from scaling . indeed , for , all solitons @xmath312 , solving @xmath313 can be obtained from the @xmath314 soliton via the transformation @xmath315 in contrast , while the gdnls solitons also inherit the scaling symmetry of gdnls , not all admissible @xmath47 can be scaled to a particular soliton . instead , @xmath316 only solitons for which @xmath317 can be scaled into one another .",
    "our results were based on the assumption that a weak solution existed . while we do not have an @xmath76 theory in general , our results can ,",
    "in part , be made rigorous as follows . for @xmath48 ,",
    "one should be able to apply the technique of @xcite to obtain a local solution in @xmath78 , with @xmath318 .",
    "alternatively , for @xmath48 and integer valued , @xcite can be invoked .",
    "again , this yields a local solution in @xmath78 , @xmath318 . for @xmath319",
    "sufficiently large , the solution will also conserve the invariants .",
    "this is sufficient to fully justify the instability of the unstable solitons , since there is sufficient regularity such that if the solution leaves a neighborhood of the soliton in @xmath76 , it also leaves in @xmath78 , @xmath318 .",
    "however , this is insufficient to prove stability , because even if the solution stays close in the @xmath76 norm , the norm of the solution could grow in a higher sobolev norm .",
    "there is also the question of the monotonicity of @xmath291 , for which we relied on numerical computation for @xmath320 .",
    "looking at figures [ f : fcurves ] and [ f : fcurves01 ] , it would appear that the @xmath321 is an upper bound on @xmath286 for @xmath322 .",
    "in addition , there appears to be a singularity at @xmath323 .",
    "likewise , the line @xmath324 appears to be an upper bound in the range @xmath325 .",
    "a more subtle analysis may permit a rigorous justification of our work in this regime .",
    "lastly , we provide some numerical experiments of solitons on both the stable and unstable branches .",
    "we studied the stability near the turning point @xmath293 . when @xmath326 , @xmath327 .",
    "the initial condition is chosen as @xmath328 we simulate using the fourth order exponential time difference scheme of@xcite , and treat the nonlinearity pseudospectrally .",
    "though the nonlinearity is not polynomial in its arguments , @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 , @xmath332 we found that dealiasing as though it were a quintic problem proved robust .",
    "our results are as follows :    1 .",
    "when @xmath333 and @xmath334 , figure [ fig : orb_stable ] shows that the solitary wave retains its shape for a long time @xmath335 .",
    "2 .   when @xmath333 and @xmath336 , figure [ fig : orb_instable ] shows that the amplitude of the solitary wave increases rapidly near @xmath337 and it is not orbitally stable .",
    "our simulation of the unstable soliton suggests that , rather than disperse or converge to a stable soliton , gdnls may result in a finite time singularity",
    ". we will explore the potential for singularity formation in the forthcoming work @xcite .     and",
