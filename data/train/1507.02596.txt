    "fermi - liquid theory , developed by landau  @xcite in the mid-1950 s , showed how low - temperature collective excitations and thermodynamic properties of strongly - interacting normal many - fermion systems could be encoded in a few parameters , the landau parameters , and that these parameters were related to a certain limiting value of the microscopic scattering function .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", landau also introduced a kinetic equation to describe the nonequilibrium properties of a fermi liquid .",
    "the kinetic equation is of the same form as the classical boltzmann equation with the local quasiparticle energy @xmath13 playing the role of a hamiltonian .",
    "the application of the linearized landau kinetic equation to the calculation of transport coefficients for bulk 3 has been very successful . in this manuscript",
    "we shall apply this approach to a strongly interacting many - fermion system in two dimensions .",
    "reviews of the bulk calculations at zero polarization can be found in the works of abrikosov and khalatnikov ,  @xcite pines and nozires ,  @xcite and baym and pethick .",
    "@xcite the calculation of transport coefficients for fermi liquids in three dimensions with arbitrary polarization can be found in anderson , pethick and quader  @xcite , and meyerovich .",
    "@xcite the former set of authors used a slick general notation that emphasized the similarities in the calculations of the various coefficients .",
    "there exist some measurements of transport coefficients as a function of polarization for bulk 3 .",

    "sawkey , puech , and wolf  @xcite studied the thermal conductivity .",
    "abrikosov and khalatnikov ( ak ) in particular showed that the integrals involved in the collision integral factor neatly into a product of integrals involving angular variables and those involving energy variables .",
    "the resulting expression for the kinetic equation could then be brought into the form of a linear integral eigenvalue problem for essentially the non - equilibrium part of the fermion distribution function .",
    "the exact solutions of these integral eigenvalue problems are derived , and discussed in detail by sykes and brooker  @xcite and also jensen , smith , and wilkins .",
    "@xcite    in recent work , we have utilized the kinetic equation approach to study the transition between collective excitations in the ballistic regime ( zero sound ) and collective excitations in the hydrodynamic regime ( first sound ) in thin , arbitrarily polarized fermi - liquid films .",
    "@xcite for sound , the kinetic equation is usually solved by rewriting the integral equation as an ( infinite ) set of algebraic equations by using a fourier expansion , and then taking moments with respect to the angular functions .",
    "this procedure is not unique , and we have compared and discussed in detail the predicted propagation speeds and attenuation for two different approaches .",
    "@xcite in the above cited works we have utilized previously calculated  @xcite density and polarization dependent landau parameters in order to obtain numerical predictions for thermodynamic and collective excitations for the specific case of 3 films . in this paper we shall use these same landau parameters to calculate predicted values for the density and polarization dependent transport coefficients in thin 3 films .",
    "the calculation of transport coefficients for thin 3 films has been considered by fu and ebner ,  @xcite and also by miyake and mullin .",
    "@xcite fu and ebner applied the variational approach that was developed by baym and ebner  @xcite in order to calculate transport coefficients for 3 in superfluid 4 bulk solutions .",
    "the variational approach of fu and ebner as applied in two dimensions does not lend itself to analytic solution , nevertheless , they were able to extract the lowest order temperature dependencies together with numerically determined coefficients for the thermal conductivity @xmath0 , the first ( or shear ) viscosity @xmath1 , and the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath2 all at zero polarization .",
    "fu and ebner obtained @xmath14 behavior for two of the coefficients , and pointed out that the source was a weak divergence in the momentum space integrals .",
    "miyake and mullin ( mm ) derived an exact expression for the spin diffusion coefficient for two - dimensional fermions with arbitrary polarization .",
    "they indicated that in two dimensions one obtains a logarithmic divergence at _ finite _ temperature in one of the angular integrals if one proceeds by strictly following the three - dimensional approach developed by ak .",
    "they identified the source of the divergence at finite temperature as an artifice of using zero - temperature values for the fermi momenta in an integrand of one of the angular integrals in the kinetic equation . in a very clever analysis , by generalizing the analysis to low but finite temperature they were able to extract an expression that yielded a logarithmic divergence only in the zero - temperature limit . in sec .",

    "we note that as in three dimensions the calculations of the thermal conductivity and the spin diffusion calculation are very similar .",
    "however , unlike three dimension , for two dimensions we find that the analysis for the shear viscosity needs significant modification . as in the case addressed by mm , the problem in the shear viscosity calculation",
    "is identified as being due to the incorrect use of the zero - temperature limit in the integrands of the angular integrals . in sec .",

    "the quasiparticle lifetime due to quasiparticle - quasiparticle interactions in two - dimensional fermi - liquids was calculated in ref .  .",
    "the method used in that reference was borrowed from two - dimensional electron theory , and took advantage of the similarity in structure between the collision integral and the free fermion dynamic structure function . the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    "together with stern s analytic expression  @xcite for the two - dimensional susceptibility yielded an analytic expression for the low - temperature lifetime . in this section",
    "we shall repeat this calculation using the miyake - mullin method .",
    "this is convenient because the lifetime calculation is similar but simpler than that for the transport coefficients .",
