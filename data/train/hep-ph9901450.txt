    "recently , cosmological fireballs are suggested as a possible production site for gamma - ray bursts as well as the high energy ( @xmath0 gev ) neutrinos @xcite .",
    "although , the origin of these cosmological gamma - ray burst fireballs ( grb ) is not yet well - understood , the observations @xcite suggest that generically a very compact source of linear scale @xmath8 cm through internal or / and external shock propagation produces these gamma - ray bursts as well as the ( burst of ) high energy neutrinos .",
    "typically , this compact source is hypothesized to be formed possibly due to the merging of binary neutron stars or due to collapse of a supermassive star .",
    "the main source of high energy tau neutrinos in grbs is the production and decay of @xmath9 .",
    "the production of @xmath9 may be through @xmath10 and/or through @xmath11 collisions . in @xcite , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 flux",
    "is estimated in @xmath11 collisions , whereas in @xcite , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 flux is estimated in @xmath14 collisions for grbs . in @xmath11 collisions , the flux of @xmath5 may be obtained through the main process of @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 decays into @xmath17 lepton and @xmath5 with a branching ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "this @xmath17 lepton further decays into @xmath5 .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath16 production , which is main source of @xmath5 s , is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 which subsequently produces @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 production is higher upto an order of magnitude than for @xmath5 production ( through @xmath9 ) .",
    "these imply that the @xmath5 flux in @xmath11 collisions is suppressed up to 3 - 4 orders of magnitude relative to corresponding @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 fluxes . in @xmath14 collisions",
    ", the main process for the production of @xmath5 may be @xmath21 with similar relevant branching ratios and corresponding cross - section values . here",
    "the corresponding main source for @xmath12 and @xmath13 production is @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , in @xmath10 collisions , the @xmath5 flux is also suppressed up to 3 - 4 orders of magnitude relative to @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 flux .",
    "thus , in both type of collisions , including the relevant kinematics , the @xmath5 flux is estimated to be rather small relative to @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 fluxes from grbs , typically being , @xmath23 @xcite .    in this brief report",
    ", we consider the possibility of obtaining higher @xmath5 neutrino flux , that is , @xmath24 , from grbs through neutrino conversions as compared to no conversion situation @xcite .",
    "in particular , we obtain the range of neutrino mixing parameters resulting from an interplay of possible violation of the equivalence principle ( vep ) parameterized by @xmath2 and the magnetic field in the vicinity of grbs yielding @xmath24 .",
    "the possibility of vep arises from the realization that different flavours of neutrinos may couple differently to gravity @xcite .",
    "the present study is particularly useful as the new ice / water erenkov light neutrino telescopes namely amanda and baikal ( also the nestor and antares ) will have energy , angle and flavour resolution for high energy neutrinos originating at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "recently , there are several discussions concerning the signatures of a possible neutrino burst from grbs correlated in time and angle @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is a suggestion of measuring @xmath5 flux from cosmologically distant sources through a double bang event @xcite or through a small pile up of upgoing @xmath1-like events near ( 10@xmath25 ) gev @xcite .",
    "the plan of this brief report is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the matter density and magnetic field in the vicinity of grbs . in sect .",
    "iii , we discuss in some detail , the range of neutrino mixing parameters that may give rise to relatively large precession / conversion probabilities resulting from an interplay of vep and the magnetic field in the vicinity of grbs for vanishing gravity and vacuum mixing angles . in the same sect .",
    ", we briefly discuss the relevant neutrino mixing parameter range for non - vanishing gravity and vacuum mixing angles with vanishing neutrino magnetic moment . in sect .",
    "iv , we give estimates of separable but contained double bang event rates induced by high energy @xmath5 s originating from grbs without / with conversions for illustrative purposes and finally in sect .",
    "v , we summarize our results .",
    "according to @xcite , the high energy neutrino production may take place in the vicinity of @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the lorentz factor ( typically @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 is the observed grb variability time scale ( typically @xmath30 ms ) .",
    "thus , the fireball matter density is @xmath31 g @xmath32 in the vicinity of @xmath33 @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the typical distance traversed by neutrinos may be taken as , @xmath34 pc , in the vicinity of grb , where 1 pc @xmath35 cm .",
    "these imply that average effective width of matter traversed by neutrinos originating from grb is @xmath36 g @xmath37 . in the presence of matter ,",
    "the relevant effective width of matter needed for appreciable spin - flavour conversions is @xmath38 g @xmath37 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 , and hence no matter effects are expected due to coherent forward scattering of neutrinos off the background for high energy neutrinos originating from grbs .",
    "taking the observed duration of the typical gamma - ray burst as , @xmath40 ms , we obtain the mass of the source as , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the gravitational constant .",
    "let us mention here that for the relatively shorter observed duration of gamma - ray burst from a typical grb , @xmath43 ms , implying @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 g is solar mass ) .",
    "we use @xmath46 in our estimates .    the magnetic field in the vicinity of a grb",
    "is obtained by considering the equipartition arguments @xcite .",
    "we use the following profile of magnetic field , @xmath47 , for @xmath48 @xcite @xmath49 where , @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the total wind luminosity ( typically @xmath52 erg s@xmath53 ) .",
    "consider a system of two mixed neutrinos @xmath4 and @xmath5 for simplicity .",
    "the difference of diagonal elements of the @xmath54 effective hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the mixed system of these oscillating neutrinos in the basis @xmath55 for vanishing vacuum and gravity mixing angles is @xcite @xmath56 whereas , each of the off diagonal elements is @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is neutrino magnetic moment ) . in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 being the neutrino energy . here",
    "@xmath62 is the effective potential felt by the neutrinos at a distance @xmath63 from a gravitational source of mass @xmath64 due to vep and is given by @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a measure of the degree of vep and @xmath67 is the gravitational potential in the keplerian approximation . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are respectively the gravitational couplings of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , such that @xmath70 .",
    "there are three relevant @xmath71 s that need to be considered @xcite .",
    "the effect of @xmath71 due to supercluster named great attractor with @xmath72 in the vicinity of grb ; @xmath71 due to grb itself , which is , @xmath73 , in the vicinity of grb and the galactic gravitational potential , which is , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , we use , @xmath75 . however , @xmath76 in the vicinity of grb .",
    "thus , @xmath77 .",
    "if the neutrino production region @xmath33 is @xmath78 cm then at @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 . at @xmath81 cm , @xmath82 and for @xmath83 cm , @xmath84 . if the supercluster is a fake object then @xmath85 . here",
    "we assume the smallness of the effect of @xmath71 due to an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , if any , nearby to grb .",
    "the possibility of vanishing gravity and vacuum mixing angle in eq .",
    "( 2 ) allows us to identify the range of @xmath2 relevant for the neutrino magnetic moment effects only .",
    "latter in this sect .",
    ", we briefly comment on the ranges of relevant neutrino mixing parameters for non - vanishing gravity and vacuum mixing angles with vanishing neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "the case of @xmath86 can be studied by replacing @xmath4 with @xmath87 along with corresponding changes in @xmath62 and @xmath88 .",
    "let us here mention that initial flux of @xmath87 may be smaller than that of @xmath13 by a factor of less than 2 @xcite , thus also possibly enhancing the expected @xmath5 flux from grbs through @xmath86 .",
    "however , we have checked that observationally this possibility leads to quite similar results in terms of event rates and are therefore not discussed here further .",
    "we now intend to study in some detail , the various possibilities arising from relative comparison between @xmath89 and @xmath62 in eq .",
    "let us first ignore the effects of vep ( @xmath90 ) . for constant @xmath91 , the spin - flavour precession probability @xmath92 is obtained using eq .",
    "( 2 ) as @xmath93   \\sin^{2}\\left(\\sqrt{(2\\mu b)^{2}+\\delta^{2 } }   \\cdot \\frac{\\delta r}{2}\\right).\\ ] ] we take @xmath6 or less , where @xmath7 is bohr magneton , which is less than the stringent astrophysical upper bound on @xmath1 based on cooling of red giants @xcite .",
    "we here consider the transition magnetic moment , allowing the possibility of simultaneously changing the neutrino flavour as well as the helicity .",
    "thus , the precessed @xmath5 is an active neutrino and interacts weakly .",
    "if @xmath58 is of dirac type , then the precession leads to disappearance / nonobservation of @xmath5 as the precessed @xmath5 is now a sterile one . in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath94 is the width of the region with @xmath91 . note that if @xmath95 , then , for @xmath96 gev and using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we obtain @xmath97 ev@xmath98 .",
    "we take , @xmath99 ev@xmath98 , as an example and consequently we obtain from eq .",
    "( 4 ) an energy independent large ( @xmath100 ) spin - flavour precession probability for @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "let us mention here that the typical relevant energy span for high energy neutrinos originating from the considered class of grbs is an order of magnitude , that is , @xmath103 ( see sect .",
    "iv ) . thus ,",
    "for @xmath58 of the order of @xmath104 , the @xmath5 flux may be higher than the expected one from grbs in the absence of spin - flavour precessions , that is , @xmath105 due to neutrino spin - flavour precession effects .",
    "since the neutrino spin - flavour precession effect is essentially determined by the product @xmath57 so one may rescale @xmath58 and @xmath91 to obtain the same results . for @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ", we obtain from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , an energy dependent @xmath108 such that @xmath109 .    with non - vanishing @xmath2 ( @xmath110 ) ,",
    "a resonant character in neutrino spin - flavour precession can be obtained for a range of values of relevant neutrino mixing parameters dependent / independent spin - flavour precession may also be obtained for nonzero @xmath2 , however , given the current status of the high energy neutrino detection , for simplicity , we ignore these possibilities which tend to overlap with this case for a certain range of relevant neutrino mixing parameters ; for details of these possibilities in the context of agn , see @xcite . ]",
    "two conditions are essential to obtain a resonant character in neutrino spin - flavour precession : the level crossing and the adiabaticity condition .",
    "the level crossing condition is obtained by taking @xmath111 and is given by : @xmath112 the other essential condition , namely , the adiabaticity in the resonance reads @xcite @xmath113 note that here @xmath114 depends explicitly on @xmath61 through @xmath62 unlike the case of ordinary neutrino spin - flip induced by the matter effects .",
    "a resonant character in neutrino spin - flavour precession is obtained if @xmath115 such that eq . ( 5 ) is satisfied .",
    "we notice that , @xmath116 for @xmath117 . here",
    "@xmath118 is obtained by setting @xmath119 in eq .",
    "the general expression for relevant neutrino spin - flavour conversion probability is given by @xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 is being evaluated at the high energy neutrino production cite in the vicinity of grb . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath123 , given by eq . ( 7 ) , as a function of neutrino energy @xmath61 ( gev ) for different @xmath124 as well as @xmath88 values . note that the resonant spin - flavour precession probability is @xmath125 1/2 for a relatively large range of @xmath88 ( and @xmath2 values ) .",
    "the expected spectrum @xmath126 of the high energy tau neutrinos originating from grbs due to spin - flavour conversions is calculated as @xcite @xmath127f^{0}(\\nu_{\\tau}+\\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau})+   p(\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}\\rightarrow \\nu_{\\tau})f^{0}(\\nu_{\\mu}+\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}),\\ ] ] where @xmath128 s are the neutrino flux spectrums originating from grbs . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the expected @xmath5 spectrum obtained by neutrino spin - flavour precessions and conversions ( induced by an interplay of vep and the magnetic field in grbs ) .",
    "we use the grb spectrum for @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath130 from @xcite and @xmath131 from @xcite and multiply these by respective @xmath123 given by eq .",
    "( 8) to obtain @xmath126 due to resonant spin - flavour precession ( lower curve in fig .",
    "the upper curve in fig . 2 is obtained by multiplying @xmath108 given by eq . ( 4 ) for small @xmath88 .",
    "let us now consider briefly the effects of nonvanishing gravity mixing angle @xmath132 and non - vanishing vacuum mixing angle @xmath133 for vanishing neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "if @xmath134 and @xmath135 , then taking the distance between a typical grb and our galaxy as , @xmath136 mpc , the vacuum flavour oscillations may occur between @xmath13 and @xmath5 for @xmath137 with maximal vacuum flavour mixing between @xmath13 and @xmath5 .",
    "these values of neutrino mixings have been suggested as a possible explanation of recent superkamiokande data concerning the deficit of atmospheric muon neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expression for flavour oscillations in vacuum is @xmath138 note that here the resulting @xmath108 is @xmath139 due to the fact that @xmath140 . for @xmath141 and @xmath142 , in the case of massless or degenerate neutrinos , the corresponding vacuum flavour oscillation analog for @xmath143 is obtained through @xmath144 and @xmath145 . for maximal @xmath132 ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath2 may be estimated by equating the argument of second @xmath146 factor equal to @xmath147 in the corresponding expression for @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath148 with @xmath149 .",
    "note that this value of @xmath2 is of the same order of magnitude as that expected for neutrinos originating from agns @xcite .",
    "in contrast to neutrino spin - flavour precession effects given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) resulting in @xmath100 , the vacuum flavour oscillations give @xmath150 , thus , allowing the possibility of isolating the mechanism of oscillation since the high energy neutrino telescopes may attempt to measure @xmath151 .",
    "further , with the improved information on either @xmath2 and/or @xmath58 , one may be able to distinguish between the situations of resonant and nonresonant spin - flavour precession induced by an interplay of vep and @xmath58 in @xmath47 .",
    "concerning possibilities of resonant flavour conversion , a resonant or / and nonresonant flavour conversion between @xmath12 and @xmath5 in the vicinity of a grb is also possible due to an interplay of vanishing / nonvanishing vacuum and gravity mixing angles @xcite .",
    "for instance , with @xmath152 , a resonant flavour conversion between @xmath12 and @xmath5 may be obtained if @xmath153 . here the relevant level crossing may occur at @xmath154 pc with @xmath155 ev@xmath98 .",
    "the km@xmath98 scale high energy neutrino telescopes may be able to obtain first examples of high energy @xmath5 , through _ double bangs _ , originating from grbs correlated in time and direction with corresponding gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "the first bang occurs due to charged current interaction of high energy tau neutrinos near / inside the neutrino telescope producing the tau lepton and the second bang occurs due to hadronic decay of this tau lepton .",
    "following @xcite , we present in table i , the expected contained but separable double bang event rates for downgoing @xmath5 in 1 km@xmath98 size water erenkov high energy neutrino telescopes for illustrative purposes .",
    "to calculate the event rates , we use martin roberts stirling ( mrs 96 r@xmath156 ) parton distributions @xcite and present event rates in units of yr@xmath53 sr@xmath53 .",
    "we have checked that other recent parton distributions give quite similar event rates and are therefore not depicted here . from table",
    "i , we notice that the event rates for neutrino spin - flavour precession are up to @xmath157 4 orders of magnitude higher than that for typical intrinsic ( no oscillations ) tau neutrino flux",
    ".    the condition of containedness is obtained by requiring that the separation between the two bangs is less than the typical @xmath157 km size of the neutrino telescope .",
    "it is obtained by equating the range of tau neutrino induced tau leptons with the size of detector implying @xmath158 gev .",
    "the condition of separableness is obtained by demanding the separation between the two bangs is larger than the typical spread of the bangs such that the amplitude of the second bang is essentially 2 times the first bang .",
    "this leads to @xmath159 gev @xcite .",
    "thus , the two bangs may be separated by a @xmath1-like track within these energy limits .",
    "the upgoing tau neutrinos at these energies may lead to a small pile up of upgoing @xmath1-like events near ( 10@xmath25 ) gev with flat zenith angle dependence @xcite .",
    "the possibility of measuring the contained but separable double bang events may enable one to distinguish between the high energy tau neutrinos and electron and/or muon neutrinos originating from cosmologically distant grbs while providing useful information about the relevant energy interval at the same time .",
    "the chance of having double bang events induced by electron and/or muon neutrinos is negligibly small for the relevant energies @xcite .",
    "we have studied in some detail the effects of neutrino spin - flavour conversions due to an interplay of the effect of possible vep and the magnetic field in grbs and have obtained the relevant range of neutrino mixing parameters for appreciable neutrino conversion probabilities .",
    "we have also briefly commented on the corresponding range of neutrino mixing parameters for vanishing neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "the matter density in the vicinity of grb is quite small ( upto 4 - 5 orders of magnitude ) to induce any resonant flavour / spin - flavour neutrino conversion due to normal matter effects .",
    "we have pointed out that a resonant character in the neutrino spin - flavour conversions may nevertheless be obtained due to possible vep .",
    "the corresponding degree of vep may be @xmath160 ) depending on @xmath88 value .",
    "the double bang event rate for intrinsic ( no oscillations / conversions ) high energy tau neutrinos originating from grbs turns out to be small as compared to that due to precession / conversion effects up to a factor of @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the high energy neutrino telescopes may provide useful upper bounds on intrinsic properties of neutrinos such as mass , mixing and magnetic moment , etc .. the relevant tau neutrino energy range for detection in 1 km@xmath98 neutrino telescopes may be @xmath162 through characteristic contained but separable double bang events .",
    "observationally , the high energy @xmath5 burst from a grb may possibly be correlated to the corresponding gamma - ray burst / highest energy cosmic rays ( if both have common origin ) in time and in direction thus raising the possibility of its detection even if there is relatively large background flux of high energy tau neutrinos from agns also from oscillations .",
    "if the range of neutrino mixing parameters pointed out in this study is realized terrestially / extraterrestially then a relatively large @xmath5 flux from grbs is expected as compared to no oscillation / conversion scenario .",
    "since the high energy neutrino telescopes may measure the ratio of the sum of tau and antitau neutrinos and the muon and antimuon neutrinos , so in principle , any change in the expected relatively small ( upto 4 orders of magnitude ) ratio may be attributed to spin - flavour precession / conversion effects as the @xmath163 channel may alternatively be a possible explanation of recent superkamiokande results concerning the deficit of atmospheric muon neutrinos .",
    "the flavour / spin - flavour conversions may occur possibly through several mechanisms .",
    "we have discussed in some detail mainly the spin - flavour precession / conversion situation induced by a nonzero neutrino magnetic moment and by a relatively small violation of equivalence principle as an example to point out the possibility of obtaining higher tau neutrino fluxes as compared to no oscillations / conversions scenarios from gamma - ray burst fireballs .",
