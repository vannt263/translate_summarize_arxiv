    "the general structure of the hadronic tensor relevant to deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) from an on - mass - shell nucleon ( @xmath0 = @xmath1 ) which transforms correctly under proper lorentz and parity transformations , and which is gauge and time - reversal invariant , is well known . in the bjorken limit the two possible structure functions collapse to one , so that , in the case of one flavour , electromagnetic deep - inelastic scattering may be expressed in terms of just one quark distribution which is a function of only one variable .",
    "( all these statements refer to spin - independent scattering , to which we restrict ourselves throughout this paper . )",
    "the situation is considerably more complex if one is considering , in a covariant formulation , dis from an off - mass - shell ( @xmath0 @xmath2 @xmath1 ) hadronic constituent within a composite target .",
    "this situation arises , for example , in many calculations relevant to the emc effect , where an off - shell nucleon contained in a nucleus interacts with a high energy probe .",
    "another application of interest is the scattering from a nucleon dressed by a meson cloud . indeed , because of the added complexity , many calculations ignore the issue completely in the hope that the effects are not large .",
    "typically one neglects not only the possible @xmath0 dependence in the structure functions , but also assumes no change in the structure of the off - shell hadron tensor . only in this case",
    "can the structure function of the target be written as a one - dimensional convolution between a constituent ( nucleon ) distribution function within the target and a quark distribution within the constituent @xcite .",
    "we shall consider scattering from an off - mass - shell nucleon without making these approximations .",
    "the purpose is to develop a theoretical framework which is exact , thus keeping the model - dependent approximations to as late a stage as possible . of course",
    ", in order to make progress we have to restrict our consideration to the interaction with a single off - shell nucleon ( impulse approximation ) . thus processes where the lepton interacts with quarks in two or more different nucleons ( final state interactions ) are excluded at this stage , even though these may not be negligible ( see section vi b ) .",
    "it is important to realise that the change in the structure of the off - shell tensor is by no means a trivial matter .",
    "there are several distinct differences from the on - shell tensor :    most obviously , the dependence on the four - momentum squared of the nucleon is no longer trivial , as it is in the case where the target is on - shell .    in a covariant formalism",
    "the off - shell fermion tensor is a 4@xmath34 matrix in the external fermion legs .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that in a relativistic theory it is necessary to consistently incorporate the antiparticle degrees of freedom .",
    "because of this matrix structure the tensor involves , at least in principle , many more independent functions than in the on - shell case .    because the incoming particles are off - mass - shell the gauge invariance condition for this tensor is not the same as in the on - shell case .    to show this last point ,",
    "consider the truncated forward virtual compton amplitude , @xmath4 , which satisfies the well - known generalised ward identity @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7 vertex function and @xmath8 is the fermion propagator .",
    "for an on - shell nucleon , the full compton amplitude is @xmath9 so that inserting eq.([ward2 ] ) into eq.([ward1 ] ) , and using the dirac equation , leads to @xmath10 note that the same equation does not hold for the off - shell tensor @xmath11 ( ie .",
    "the right hand side of eq.([ward2 ] ) is non - zero ) , even for the case where the target is a free , pointlike fermion .",
    "although in calculations of nuclear structure functions the off - shell aspects of the nucleon structure function have usually been ignored , a few partial attempts have been made to try to account for these effects .",
    "unfortunately , these calculations are not without ambiguities @xcite .",
    "kusno and moravcsik @xcite used the so - called ` off - shell kinematics  on - shell dynamics ' scheme , in which the off - shell nucleon tensor is evaluated at the same energy transfer @xmath12 and four - momentum transfer @xmath13 as the on - shell one , independent of the virtuality of the nucleon .",
    "bodek and ritchie @xcite used a similar scheme , however they suggested that the off - shell structure functions could be identified with the on - shell ones , evaluated for the same values of @xmath14 and centre of mass energy squared @xmath15 , and hence a different value of energy transfer , @xmath16 .",
    "dunne and thomas @xcite , on the other hand , used an ansatz in which the matrix elements of the hadronic operators in the operator product expansion were assumed to be independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the result was a nucleon structure function that was to be evaluated at a shifted value of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath13-rescaling parameter ) .",
    "this result was mathematically equivalent to the dynamical rescaling model of close , roberts and ross @xcite and nachtmann and pirner @xcite , in which the shift in @xmath13 was attributed to a change in confinement radius for nucleons bound inside a nucleus .",
    "all of the above treatments use , in one form or other , the familiar convolution formula @xcite , which amounts to folding the quark momentum distribution in the off - shell constituent with the constituent momentum distribution in the target . in order to derive this formula",
    "it is assumed that the form of the off - shell nucleon tensor ( i.e. the structure in its dirac indices ) is the same as the on - shell one @xcite .",
    "however , as we show in sections ii and iii , more than one operator contributes in the bjorken limit , so there is no _ a priori _ reason for this to be a valid assumption .",
    "the appearance of these other operator structures is closely connected with the antiparticle degrees of freedom arising in any relativistic treatment and constitutes an important part of the off - shell effects .",
    "relativistic calculations have been attempted in the past by kulagin @xcite , nakano @xcite and gross and liuti @xcite , however their derivations of the convolution model also relied critically on assumptions about the off - shell tensor , and the relativistic bound nucleon density matrix , respectively .",
    "in fact , to our knowledge , all attempts to derive the simple covariant convolution model have ultimately resorted to some prescription to account for the fact that the bound nucleon has @xmath19 . without performing a full calculation which self - consistently accounts for the nucleon virtuality ,",
    "the validity of the various _ ad hoc _ approximations remains unclear . in short ,",
    "the naive convolution formula is not a sound starting point for discussing off - shell effects and we make no use of it .",
    "there exist alternative approaches to these just described which do not suffer from off - mass - shell ambiguities .",
    "for the nuclear emc effect , berger et al .",
    "@xcite used light - front dynamics to calculate the nuclear structure functions . here",
    "all particles are on - mass - shell , the transverse momentum and the light - cone variable @xmath20 are conserved at each vertex , while @xmath21 is not . alternatively , johnson and speth @xcite and heller and thomas @xcite used old - fashioned perturbation theory with the instant form of dynamics , where particles are on - mass - shell , three - momentum is conserved , but not necessarily energy .",
    "unfortunately , in both of these approaches , the off - mass - shell ambiguities in the definition of the off - shell structure functions are simply replaced by off - energy - shell ambiguities @xcite .",
    "a review of some of the problems with these approaches may be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the covariant method in nuclear calculations is that lorentz invariance is manifest .",
    "however , for a consistent treatment within this framework one has to include the antiparticle degrees of freedom , which has not been done up to now .",
    "we will set up the formalism in such a way that the structure functions of the physical target are expressed in terms of fully relativistic quark  nucleon and nucleon  target vertex functions .",
    "this will enable us to ensure gauge invariance , the callan - gross relation and an unambiguous identification of the scaling variables .",
    "all model approximations will be contained entirely in the vertex functions themselves , which , of course , we can not calculate from first principles .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section ii we define the general structure of the off - shell tensor in terms of a suitable set of structure functions . in section iii",
    "we explicitly calculate the scaling properties of these functions .",
    "as we shall see , only 3 of 14 possible functions contribute in the bjorken limit .",
    "in section iv we discuss how our formalism can be used to calculate structure functions of composite particles and discuss the limits in which the conventional convolution model may be obtained . in section v we use some simple parameterisations of the relativistic vertex functions to calculate the nucleon valence quark distributions . using these same vertex functions",
    "we then calculate in section vi the structure functions of composite targets containing off - shell nucleons .",
    "the process in which we are interested is depicted in fig.[1 ] , with the photon momentum @xmath22 and the off - shell nucleon momentum @xmath23 marked . due to hermiticity , covariance , parity and time reversal invariance the corresponding off - shell tensor @xmath24 is a 4@xmath34 matrix depending on @xmath23 and @xmath22 , and may in general be written in terms of 14 functions : @xmath25 where the braces @xmath26 around the subscripts indicate the symmetric @xmath27 combination . here",
    ", @xmath28 are the most general tensors of rank two which may be constructed out of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath29 the functions @xmath30 on the right hand side of eq.([eq : tensor ] ) , as well as @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq.([chiuv ] ) , are real scalar functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the tensors @xmath33 are defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being any four - vector .",
    "the above decomposition of the off - shell tensor is of course not unique .",
    "it is written in this convenient form because the tensors @xmath33 turn out to be projection operators @xcite and satisfy @xmath38 with all other combinations vanishing .",
    "it is important to note that in the bjorken limit these relations are also true for projectors involving different momenta .",
    "that is , the projectors are still orthogonal in this limit and @xmath39    in general , fig.[1 ] is a subdiagram of fig.[2 ] , where @xmath40 is the on - shell momentum of the composite target ( labelled @xmath41 ) .",
    "as will be discussed more fully in sections iv and v , the hadron tensor for the complete process , @xmath42 , involves an integral over the nucleon momentum @xmath23 of the tensor @xmath43 , traced with another 4@xmath34 matrix originating in the soft target ",
    "constituent part of the diagram .",
    "hence no experiment measures the off - shell tensor by itself , so it is not possible to measure all the functions @xmath30 separately .",
    "only combinations thereof give rise to observable experimental quantities . using the above projectors",
    ", we can determine which combinations of off - shell structure functions contribute to the physical ones .",
    "in particular , the operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 project from the composite target tensor @xmath42 the transverse , longitudinal and the two possible gauge non - invariant contributions , respectively , in terms of the scalar functions @xmath46 .    not all of the functions @xmath30 will in fact be independent , as the gauge invariance of the theory requires that the latter two contributions vanish .",
    "furthermore , the longitudinal function must also be zero in the bjorken limit ( @xmath47 fixed ) , if the callan - gross relation is to be satisfied . that this is indeed the case",
    "is shown explicitly in the appendix .",

    "we derive the scaling behaviour of the functions @xmath30 using the parton model , by separating the hard , @xmath13-dependent part of the truncated amplitude @xmath43 from the soft , non - perturbative component .",
    "we will see that eq.([prwh ] ) simplifies considerably , as many terms do not contribute in the bjorken limit .",
    "a special case of the above formalism is dis from an on - shell nucleon , described by the tensor which we denote by @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the contribution to the nucleon tensor is given by eq.([prwh ] ) traced with @xmath51 , where @xmath40=@xmath23 and no integration over @xmath23 is performed : @xmath52 .",

    "in this section we calculate the leading twist contribution to the off - shell structure functions within the covariant quark - parton model .",
    "the formal result of the operator product expansion enables us to separate the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude , depicted in fig.[3 ] , into its hard ( calculable perturbatively ) and soft ( non - perturbative ) components , denoted by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "this result is completely general , so that model dependent approximations for the vertex functions do not affect these results .",

    "note that eq.([ccc ] ) applies to a target recoil state of definite mass , @xmath99 .",
    "in general we could also have a sum over all excited recoil states , or equivalently an integration over the masses @xmath99 weighted by some target recoil spectral function .",
    "the transverse structure function of the target is obtained from eq.([ccc ] ) by using the transverse projection operator defined in eq.([proj ] ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 ,  @xmath102 in the target rest frame ) , and we have used the @xmath103-function to fix @xmath104 .    the convolution model may only be derived from eq.([targetstruc ] ) if we make some additional assumptions .",
    "first of all , we need to assume that the target structure function can be written in factorised form , in terms of the nucleon structure function , @xmath105 , and some nucleon distribution function , @xmath106 : @xmath107 furthermore , to obtain the usual one - dimensional convolution formula @xcite we must assume that @xmath105 is independent of @xmath0 : @xmath108 where now the integral over @xmath0 has been absorbed into the definition of @xmath109 .",
    "there are several ways in which the first assumption might be valid :    case ( a ) :  if all but one of the functions @xmath110 are zero in the bjorken limit .",
    "most authors ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) adopt this choice , as this is the case for a pointlike fermion ( where only @xmath111 contributes ) .",
    "however , as was shown in section iii , all three functions @xmath87 in principle contribute in the bjorken limit , so that one would require that some of the functions @xmath112 in eqs.([chit ] ) vanish or cancel .",
    "we know of no reason why this should be the case  indeed even the extremely simple quark ",
    "nucleon vertex functions which we consider in the next section give rise to more than one non - vanishing @xmath87 .",
    "case ( b ) :  if more than one of the @xmath87 is non - zero , but the non - zero ones are proportional to each other .",
    "for example , @xmath113 and all other @xmath112 s equal to zero would imply @xmath114 , and so eq.([con1 ] ) is obtained .",
    "again , in general there does nt seem to be any reason to expect this behaviour .",
    "case ( c ) :  if the non - zero nucleon  target functions @xmath115 multiplying the functions @xmath87 are proportional to each other .",
    "an example of this would be if @xmath116 , which would then give eq.([con1 ] ) .",
    "in general this will not be true unless the @xmath117 limit is taken inside the functions @xmath115 .    in short , none of the above conditions",
    "are generally satisfied in a self - consistent , fully covariant ( relativistic ) calculation .",
    "consequently the convolution model interpretation , eq.([con2 ] ) , of the nuclear structure function in terms of bound nucleon structure functions is inconsistent within this formalism .",
    "this difficulty is intrinsically related to the presence of antinucleon degrees of freedom , which are not accounted for in the traditional convolution model .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of the convolution model , the common practice of extracting nucleon structure functions from nuclear dis data is rather ambiguous .",
    "indeed , the very concept of a structure function of a nucleon bound within a nucleus looses its utility .",
    "one is _ forced _ to consider quark and nuclear degrees of freedom side by side in the calculation of nuclear structure functions .    using eq.([targetstruc ] )",
    "directly we may compare , for some simple vertex functions , the exact result with those obtained by making the convolution model approximation , eq.([con2 ] ) .",
    "this we will do in the next section . as a final comment",
    ", it should be noted that , within the physical assumptions made by the use of the model in the first place ( i.e. no final state interactions ) , the functions @xmath87 are independent of the physical target , and depend only on the constituent nucleon . by selecting various targets ( i.e. by varying @xmath115 ) the relative contributions from the functions @xmath118 could in principle",
    "be probed , provided , of course , we know the nucleon  target functions sufficiently well .",
    "conversely , once the @xmath87 have been determined for one process , they may be used for all other processes .",
    "to calculate the transverse structure function of the complete target requires two sets of functions describing the soft , non - perturbative physics , namely the quark ",
    "nucleon functions @xmath81@xmath82 , and the nucleon  target functions @xmath119 . here",
    "we concentrate on the former set .",
    "we observe that because both the constituent nucleon and struck quark inside the nucleon have spin 1/2 , the intermediate spectator state will have either spin 0 or 1 . in order to make an overall lorentz scalar",
    ", we therefore need only consider quark ",
    "nucleon vertices that transform as a scalar or vector under lorentz transformations .",
    "it is straightforward to identify the form of the vertices that are allowed by lorentz , parity and time - reversal invariance , however the specific momentum dependence has to be determined within a model .",
    "there will be 15 independent scalar ( @xmath120 ) and vector ( @xmath121 ) vertex functions appearing in the general expression @xmath122 for a scalar vertex , and @xmath123 for a vector vertex .",
    "the functions @xmath81@xmath82 in eq.([galpha ] ) can be uniquely determined from these vertex functions . to see this ,",
    "let us firstly consider the scalar vertex .",
    "the general target  constituent function from section iii , @xmath124 , will be proportional to @xmath125 . using the fierz theorem the dirac indices can be rearranged into a form that enables the connection with the functions @xmath71 to be explicit : @xmath126 where @xmath127 ^ 2-m_s^2 \\right)$ ] and @xmath128 is the mass of the scalar spectator system .    calculating the functions @xmath129 from first principles amounts to solving the relativistic , many - body bound state problem .",
    "as this is presently not possible one could resort to models such as the mit bag model .",
    "it is not our aim to do this in this paper .",
    "rather , we shall choose a single scalar vertex , say @xmath130 , and use phenomenological input to constrain its functional form . from eq.([fscalar ] ) we find that the @xmath131 vertex contributes only to @xmath82 :",
    "@xmath132 ^ 2-m_s^2 \\right ) \\hspace{3 cm } [ \\rm scalar\\ vertex ] .",

    "this in turn implies that there are scaling contributions to both of the functions @xmath137 and @xmath111 in eqs.([chit ] ) , thereby failing to satisfy scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) in section iv for the derivation of the convolution model . for more complicated quark ",
    "nucleon vertices , even more of the @xmath112 s will be non - zero .    the @xmath138 dependence of the functions @xmath139 can be most easily modelled by considering the on - shell nucleon structure function .",

    "the large-@xmath61 limit is known to be dominated by valence @xmath140 quarks , which implies that the scalar vertex dominates at large @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "now note that , as the spectator state is on - mass - shell , the quark four - momentum will behave as @xmath141 at large @xmath61 . in order to obtain the correct large-@xmath61 behaviour of the structure function , namely @xmath142 , the @xmath138 dependence in the scalar vertex function must be @xmath143 , after we also take into account the two quark propagators , as well as the factor @xmath144 arising from the delta function @xmath145 ^ 2-m_r^2 \\right)$ ] for the on - shell diquark state of mass @xmath146 or @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "we fix the large-@xmath138 behaviour of the vector vertex function in a similar way , this time by requiring that we obtain the correct valence @xmath148 ratio at large @xmath61 , namely @xmath149 .",
    "this means that the vertex function for dis from valence @xmath150 quarks has to go like @xmath151 for large @xmath61 , i.e. like @xmath152 ( there is an additional @xmath153 factor arising from the trace for the vector diquark ) .",
    "it may now seem reasonable to choose a simple monopole form for the scalar vertex function , as was done , for example , in refs.@xcite , and a corresponding one for the vector vertex .",
    "we do not do this , however , for the following reason .",
    "the quark propagator , @xmath154 , in eq.([iop ] ) contains a pole . because the kinematic maximum for @xmath138 is @xmath155 , this pole is in the physical region of @xmath138 when @xmath156 .",
    "the origin of this pole is clear  the model , so far , is not confining and the proton may dissociate into its quark and diquark constituents .",
    "one solution would be to make the sum of the quark and diquark masses so large that this can not occur .",
    "however , we do not believe that this is desirable  confinement occurs not because the quark mass is large ( it is only a few mev ) , but in a dynamical way associated with the nature of the colour interaction . the only way that the information about colour confinement can enter in this model is through the relativistic quark",
    " nucleon vertex function . a convenient way to ensure that the contribution from a deconfined quark is excluded is to choose a numerator in @xmath139 so that the integrand in the structure function remains finite at the on - shell point , @xmath157 .",
    "for the masses of the scalar and vector diquark , @xmath128 and @xmath135 , the only information available to us is that from low energy models , such as the bag model or the non - relativistic quark model .",
    "there , at a scale ( @xmath158 ) of order a few hundred mev@xmath159 , the diquark masses are expected to be somewhere within the range of 600 to 1100 mev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the nucleon@xmath160 mass splitting we also anticipate that @xmath135 would be some 200 mev larger than @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the vertex functions is of course more difficult to obtain , since for this purpose data on nuclear structure functions must be used . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 dependence will not be restricted to the quark ",
    "nucleon vertex function alone , but will also be present in the nucleon ",
    "nucleus vertices , which introduces an inherent uncertainty in the determination of the former .",
    "nevertheless , the functions @xmath139 do not depend on the nuclear target  that information is contained entirely in the functions @xmath115 . since for the deuteron the @xmath0 dependence of the relativistic @xmath161 vertex can be related to known deuteron wavefunctions @xcite , we may use deuteron dis data to constrain this universal @xmath0 dependence of the quark ",
    "nucleon vertex functions .",
    "in order to obtain the valence quark distribution for the deuteron , we will use data obtained from muon scattering for @xmath162 , where valence quarks are known to dominate .",
    "because of isospin symmetry ( @xmath163 ) only a single experimental quantity for the deuteron ( compared with two @xmath164 and @xmath165 for the nucleon ) is meaningful , namely @xmath166 , where @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath140 , @xmath169 are the up and down quark distributions in the deuteron and bound proton , respectively .",
    "hence we can not differentiate between the @xmath0 dependence in @xmath170 and that in @xmath171 .",
    "we therefore choose a simple monopole form and use the same cut - off mass , @xmath172 , in both functions .",
    "a detailed comparison between the model and data for @xmath173 would require separation of the valence and sea components of @xmath174 .",
    "although in principle this could be done by analysing the @xmath175 and @xmath176 dis data , in practice those data suffer from poor statistics .",
    "furthermore , typically only the extracted quark distributions in the nucleon are presented @xcite , and these depend on the theoretical assumptions made to treat binding and fermi motion corrections .",
    "to summarise , the vertex functions that we use are given by    [ verf ] @xmath177    we find the best fit to the experimental nucleon distributions at @xmath178 gev@xmath159 ( we evolve the curves from @xmath179 gev@xmath159 using leading order qcd evolution , with @xmath180 mev @xcite ) for masses @xmath181 mev and @xmath182 mev , and cut - offs @xmath183 gev and @xmath184 gev , which we fit to the recent parameterisations by morfin and tung , and owens @xcite .",
    "the fits to the @xmath185 valence quark distribution as well as the valence @xmath148 ratio are shown in figs.[4 ] and [ 5 ] respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that such simple forms for the vertex functions reproduce the data so well .",
    "having parameterised the free nucleon vertices , we are now ready to consider the specific cases of dis from the deuteron , from nuclear matter , and from dressed nucleons . throughout , we consider the isoscalar valence structure function , @xmath186 , where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the quark distributions arising in connection with the scalar and vector diquarks , respectively , normalised so that their first moments are unity ( from the spin - flavour wavefunction of the proton we have @xmath189 and @xmath190 ) .",
    "we examine nuclear dis from a deuteron for several reasons .",
    "firstly , it is critical to know the size of the off - mass - shell corrections to the deuteron structure function if ultimately the nuclear emc data ( which usually measures the ratio of nuclear to deuterium structure functions ) is to be used to draw conclusions about the differences between quark distributions in free nucleons and those bound in nuclei .",
    "secondly , in the absence of high - statistics neutrino data , the neutron structure function is often inferred from the deuteron structure function using the naive assumption of additivity of the bound proton and neutron structure functions .",
    "apart from the off - mass - shell effects which we consider here , several other effects spoil this simple assumption .",
    "for example , nuclear shadowing is important as @xmath191 @xcite , and of course the deuteron structure function extends beyond @xmath192 to @xmath193 .",
    "hence deviations from additivity occur over much of the range of @xmath61 . for a reliable extraction of the neutron structure function",
    "a systematic computation of these effects is clearly necessary .",
    "the calculation of dis from the deuteron is more straightforward and reliable than for heavier nuclei , since the relativistic deuteron ",
    "nucleon vertex is reasonably well understood .",
    "the treatment of the deuteron recoil state is simplified by the fact that most of the time this will be an on - shell nucleon , as this can be expected to dominate the contributions from processes with a recoil @xmath194 or roper resonance , or a higher mass state .",
    "the structure of the general @xmath161 vertex , with one nucleon on - shell , was first derived by blankenbecler and cook @xcite , @xmath195 , where the @xmath161 vertex function is @xcite @xmath196 , \\label{dnn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath197 is the charge conjugation operator .",
    "the functions @xmath198 and @xmath199 are related to the @xmath200 and @xmath201 deuteron wavefunctions , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively , by    [ fghi ] @xmath204    where @xmath205 and @xmath206 is the off - shell nucleon s three - momentum . for the deuteron wavefunctions we use the model of buck and gross @xcite , with a pseudo - vector @xmath207-exchange interaction .    for the spin - averaged deuteron hadronic tensor we therefore need to evaluate the trace @xmath208                                      \\label{dtrace}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath209 is the polarisation vector for a deuteron with helicity @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .",

    "however , we still need to fix the normalisation constants in eqs.([verf ] ) .",
    "naturally , these will be functions of the cut - off @xmath172 . actually , if the exact quark ",
    "nucleon vertex functions were known , they would be the same for the off - shell as for the on - shell nucleon .",
    "we do not assume this , however , as the vertex functions which we use are only approximations to the exact results .",
    "for example , the arguments given in section v , relating to the counting rules which give the @xmath138 dependence of the vertex functions , are based on quark distributions in an on - shell nucleon . in an off - shell nucleon",
    "the connection between @xmath61 and @xmath138 is given by the modified expression @xmath213 with @xmath214 now constrained by the @xmath103-function for the on - shell nuclear recoil state ( see section iv ) . in principle , the asymptotic @xmath138 dependence for the quark  off - shell nucleon vertices expected from counting rules could be determined after integration over the nucleon s momentum . clearly this is a much more complicated task than was the case for the on - shell nucleon , and we do not believe our simple ansatz for the vertices warrants such a treatment , in which case we shall simply normalise by comparing with the data .    in fig.[6 ]",
    "we compare the experimental @xmath174 at @xmath215 gev@xmath159 with the calculated total valence quark distribution in the deuteron , @xmath216 , evolved from the same value of @xmath179 gev@xmath159 ( since we use the same diquark masses ) as for the free nucleon distributions in section v. the result of the full calculation is almost independent of the value of @xmath172 used , after the normalisation constants for the vertex functions have been determined by the charge conservation condition .",
    "this is because the @xmath217 distribution is strongly peaked at small transverse momenta , @xmath218 mev , so that modification of the large @xmath217 ( or large @xmath219 ) behaviour by altering the form factor cut - off has negligible consequences .",
    "clearly there is very good agreement between the model calculation and the data for @xmath220 .",
    "from the discussion in sections iv and v it should be clear that it is not possible to justify the convolution model for deuteron deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "still , it is of interest to compare our results with those of previous calculations that have made use of convolution - like formulas .",
    "firstly we can notice that by taking the on - shell limit ( @xmath221 ) for the kinematic factors in @xmath222 and @xmath223 in eqs.([adeut ] ) , we obtain @xmath224 , thereby satisfying condition ( c ) in section iv for the convolution model ( although this approximation need not be taken in the functions @xmath225 themselves ) . such an approximation is in the spirit of that used in ref.@xcite for the nuclear structure functions .",
    "the result of this approximation is shown in the dashed curve of fig.[6 ] , where we have used the same normalisation constants in eqs.([verf ] ) ( for @xmath226 ) as those determined in the full calculation .",
    "the effect is a reduction in the absolute value of the structure function , without much affect on the shape . by artificially normalising the new distribution",
    "so that the final result conserves baryon number , this curve becomes almost indistinguishable from the full result .",
    "however , there is no good reason for using different normalisation constants in this approximation , since the @xmath117 limit is taken in the nuclear part of the diagram and thus should not in principle affect the quark  off - shell nucleon vertex .",
    "in other calculations using the convolution model for deuterium , the most common prescription has been to drop all terms but @xmath227 in the expansion of @xmath24 ( in eq.([dtrace ] ) ) , and to replace @xmath228 by the experimental , on - shell structure function of the nucleon @xcite , in fig.[6 ] the dotted curve shows the result after renormalisation to ensure baryon number two for the deuteron .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the difference in shape between the full result and this ansatz is as small as it is .",
    "still , a discrepancy of @xmath229 is quite significant in a system as loosely bound as the deuteron .    a numerically significant difference between the convolution approach and the exact calculation is of particular importance if one recalls that the neutron structure function is extracted from structure functions of light nuclei , such as deuterium , using the convolution model .",
    "indeed , in view of the problems which we have just described , it is rather worrying than our knowledge of @xmath230 is based on this . as seen in fig.[6 ] , depending on the approximation or ansatz taken in calculating @xmath174 , the deviation from the correct , @xmath0-dependent result , will vary .",
    "still , although unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view , by artificially re - normalising the deuteron structure function by hand so that it respects baryon number conservation , the differences can be reduced .",
    "a similar situation arises in calculations of the nuclear emc effect , in which differences between nuclear and deuteron structure functions are explored .",
    "clearly for any accurate description of this effect we need firstly to have a reliable method of calculating the deuteron structure function .",
    "as we have seen , the off - shell effects that are ignored in the deuteron may be compensated for by suitably renormalising the final result . whether this can also be done in other , heavier",
    ", nuclei is not clear . certainly in heavy nuclei",
    "we would expect off - shell effects to play some role . to date",
    "these have not been adequately accounted for , and this is what we turn to next .",
    "for any nucleus we can easily repeat the above calculation if we know the relativistic nucleon  nucleus vertex functions .",
    "unfortunately , at the present time these are not at all well known for heavy nuclei .",
    "a solution to this problem would be to simply parameterise the vertex functions , and to make some assumptions for the nuclear recoil state . alternatively ,",
    "if one tried to use non - relativistic nuclear models as an approximation , it would be difficult to incorporate the off - shell nucleon structure .",
    "the best way is to consider first the simpler case of a nucleon embedded in nuclear matter . in this type of calculation",
    "the off - shell effects are parameterised in the effective nucleon mass , @xmath231 .",
    "experimentally , the effective nucleon mass at nuclear matter density ( @xmath232 @xmath233 ) is found to be @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "theoretically , there is a large number of models for nuclear matter , which predict a wide range of effective nucleon masses .",
    "the quantum hadrodynamics model of walecka and serot @xcite , in which pointlike nucleons ( in the mean field approximation ) are bound by the exchange of scalar ( @xmath235 ) and vector ( @xmath236 ) mesons , predicts rather small effective masses , @xmath237 .",
    "somewhat larger masses are obtained when explicit quark degrees of freedom are introduced .",
    "for example , in the guichon model @xcite , where the @xmath235 and @xmath236 mesons are allowed to couple directly to quarks inside the nucleons , the value of @xmath238 is typically @xmath239 .",
    "even larger values are obtained if one includes centre - of - mass corrections and self - coupling of the scalar fields @xcite . rather than choose a specific nuclear model , we let @xmath238 be a parameter and examine the effect of its variation upon the nucleon structure function , defined in eq.([wtreal ] ) .    because the quark  nucleon vertex function will now also depend on the effective mass , it would be inappropriate to use the same normalisation constants in eqs.([verf ] ) as those determined by normalising the on - shell nucleon distributions .",
    "therefore the normalisation constants in this case must be determined by normalising the calculated quark distributions in nuclear matter , for @xmath240 , so that their first moments are unity .",
    "fig.[7 ] shows the isoscalar valence nucleon structure function , @xmath241 @xmath242 , for a range of effective masses , @xmath243 .",
    "there is clearly quite significant softening of the structure function , with the most prominent effects appearing for @xmath244 .",
    "however , it should be remembered that our formalism neglects interactions between the spectator quarks and the surrounding nucleons in the nuclear medium ( i.e. it assumes the impulse approximation ) .",
    "this has been found to be quite a poor approximation @xcite for nuclear matter .",
    "a simple way to estimate the importance of final state interactions is to assume that the strength of the interaction of the spectator diquark with the nuclear medium is 2/3 that of the nucleon interaction , and that it is independent of the mass of the diquark . in that case",
    "the diquark mass is modified by @xmath245 , where @xmath246 for both scalar and vector diquarks .",
    "the effect of this is shown in fig.[8 ] . as can be seen , interactions of the spectator diquark lead to a hardening of the quark distribution , typically of the same order of magnitude as the nucleon off - shell effects .",
    "combined with the off - shell effects , this gives a structure function which ( for @xmath247 ) is @xmath248 larger than the on - shell result for @xmath249 . for quantitative comparison against deep - inelastic scattering data on nuclear structure functions",
    "it would therefore be very valuable to develop a consistent formalism incorporating both effects .",
    "models of the nucleon which incorporate pcac by including a pion cloud have been used in dis , among other things , to estimate the size of the @xmath250 form factor @xcite , and to calculate the flavour symmetry breaking in the proton sea , the possibility of which was recently suggested by the result of the new muon collaboration s measurement of the gottfried sum rule @xcite .",
    "previous covariant calculations @xcite have all relied upon the same assumptions as for the nuclear calculations , namely the validity of the convolution formula in the first place , and the lack of any dependence of the bound nucleon structure function on @xmath0 and @xmath251 . in this section",
    "we apply the formalism we have developed for dealing with off - shell effects to the part of this problem where the virtual photon hits the virtual nucleon , with its spectator pion left on - mass - shell .    in order to calculate this contribution",
    "the only additional ingredient which we need is the ` sideways ' @xmath252 form factor , @xmath253 , where one nucleon is off - mass - shell . for this",
    "we use the same monopole form that is usually used in the literature @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath254 with @xmath255 gev and a pseudoscalar @xmath256 coupling . with this",
    ", we can rearrange the relevant trace in eq.([ccc ] ) , @xmath257 ,                                       \\label{pitrace}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain the nucleon  pion functions @xmath258 ,    [ api ] @xmath259    again , as was the case for the deuteron , by inserting @xmath221 in @xmath260 we can satisfy the conditions of case ( c ) in section iv . however , the structure function this time is proportional to @xmath261 ( i.e. negative ) , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "this illustrates the fact that even though the one - dimensional convolution formula may indeed be obtained from the exact result by certain approximations ( e.g. on - shell limit ) , there is no guarantee that these approximations are physically meaningful .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the convolution model may be derived if , amongst other things , one assumes that the off - shell nucleon structure is the same as that of a point - like fermion @xcite , in which case the relevant operator in @xmath24 is @xmath262 . as we have seen above , this is only part of the complete expression in the bjorken limit if one assumes the nucleon quark vertex to be of the form in section v. nevertheless , the model of @xcite can be obtained using these vertices if the following steps are taken : firstly the trace in eq.([pitrace ] ) evaluated with the @xmath263 structure ; then to obtain factorisation the limits @xmath264 and @xmath117 taken in the ` nucleon structure function ' ( i.e. @xmath62-dependent ) parts ; and finally the full structure of the on - shell nucleon structure function used , as in eq.([wtreal ] ) , rather than just keeping the @xmath111 term .",
    "the necessity of the last point is clear , since for the on - shell structure function the _ individual _ functions @xmath87 are not necessarily positive definite , although the sum of course is positive .",
    "other authors @xcite have implicitly assumed that the relevant operator to be used in the @xmath24 of eq.([pitrace ] ) is @xmath227 , similar to what was done in the convolution model calculation for the deuteron discussed in section vi a. however , even with the subsequent replacement of @xmath228 by the full on - shell nucleon structure function in the convolution expression , the result will be proportional to @xmath261 since the coefficient of @xmath228 is @xmath265 .",
    "thus it appears that the result of @xcite can only be obtained by taking the modulus of a negative structure function .",
    "clearly , the above procedures are somewhat arbitrary .",
    "it is a reflection of the fact that none of the scenarios described in section iv ( namely cases ( a)(c ) ) for obtaining the convolution model are applicable . as in the deuteron case ,",
    "the convolution model for dressed nucleons is not derivable from the exact result .    in fig.[9 ]",
    "we show the result of the convolution model of @xcite .",
    "this is compared with the result of the calculation including the full @xmath0 dependence , with the quark ",
    "nucleon vertex function evaluated with @xmath226 , as for the deuteron . for the full calculation we use the same normalisation constants for the quark ",
    "nucleon vertices as determined from the on - shell nucleon calculation in section v. the results indicate that the full , @xmath0-dependent calculation gives somewhat smaller results compared with those of the convolution model ( although the shapes are quite similar , as can be seen from the dotted curve , where we normalise the scalar and vector vertex functions to give the same first moments as in the convolution model ) .",
    "such a difference might have been surprising had the convolution expression been a simple approximation to the full result , in which case we may well have expected small off - shell corrections .",
    "unfortunately , this calculation is more difficult to check since there is no clear normalisation condition for the structure function .",
    "comparing the first moment of the calculated distributions with the average number of pions in the intermediate state , which can be calculated by considering dis from the virtual pion , is ambiguous due to the presence of antiparticles in the covariant formulation .",
    "( a convolution formula such as eq.([con1 ] ) can be written for dis from virtual pions , since there are no spinor degrees of freedom to spoil this factorisation .",
    "however , ambiguities in the @xmath0 dependence of the ` off - shell pion structure function ' would still remain . )",
    "we therefore believe that this fact illustrates the absence of a firm foundation for the covariant convolution model for dis from dressed nucleons ( see @xcite for an alternative approach to this calculation ) .",
    "we have investigated within a covariant framework the deep - inelastic scattering from composite particles containing virtual nucleon constituents .",
    "the scattering has been treated as a two - step process , in which the off - shell nucleon in the target interacts with the high energy probe",
    ". the treatment amounts to neglecting final state interactions .",
    "we have constructed the truncated photon  nucleon amplitude from 14 general , independent functions , and used the parton model to show that only 3 of these are relevant in describing the deep - inelastic structure functions in the bjorken limit .",
    "the calculation explicitly ensures current conservation and the callan - gross relation .    within this framework",
    "we can unambiguously examine under what conditions the conventional convolution model breaks down .",
    "furthermore , we use some simple models of the relativistic quark  nucleon and nucleon  nucleus vertex functions to investigate this breakdown numerically .",
    "while the failure of the convolution model may appear to be an unwelcome complication , it is clear that in any theoretically self - consistent calculation which takes off - mass - shell effects into account it is an inevitable one .",
    "indeed , the ` bound nucleon structure function ' is an ill - defined quantity within a covariant formulation .",
    "this has wide - ranging consequences , as almost all calculations of composite target structure functions ( e.g. nuclei , for the emc effect ) have relied upon the validity of the simple convolution model .",
    "we have been able to calculate the deuteron structure function without making any assumptions about the @xmath0 dependence of the structure functions , and find excellent agreement with the data in the region of @xmath61 where our model is applicable ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "making various assumptions for the off - shell nucleons naturally introduces deviations from the exact result .",
    "however , by suitably renormalising the approximated curves by hand to ensure baryon number conservation ( as was done in most previous calculations ) the differences between the exact results and those of the convolution ansatz are minimised .",
    "although this is most unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view , phenomenologically the consequences of neglecting the nucleon off - shell effects in the deuteron may not be too great .",
    "to understand the consequences of the off - shell effects in heavy nuclei , we considered a simple model of a nucleon embedded in nuclear matter .",
    "we found quite a significant softening of the structure function at intermediate @xmath61 when the nuclear medium acts to decrease the effective nucleon mass .",
    "however , interactions of the spectator diquark state with the surrounding medium tend to make the overall structure function some @xmath266 harder at large @xmath61 ( @xmath249 ) , for @xmath247 , compared with the on - shell result .    the other application which has been examined is dis from the virtual nucleon component of a physical , or dressed , nucleon , where we also find quite significant differences between the full result and the convolution model .",
    "a detailed quantitative understanding of this effect is needed in order to be able to describe the @xmath61 distributions for all processes where the nucleon s dissociation into a virtual nucleon and meson is expected to be of importance , such as in the measurement of the asymmetry in the light sea quark sector of the proton and neutron , as well as the neutron spin structure function @xmath267 .",
    "this work was supported by the australian research council .",
    "one of us ( aws ) would like to acknowledge the kind hospitality extended to him by the theory group during his visit to adelaide , where this work was commenced .",
    "here we give the full details regarding the vanishing of the longitudinal and non gauge - invariant structure functions .    using the projection operators defined in section ii we project from the truncated nucleon tensor @xmath24 the contributions to the longitudinal ( @xmath268 ) and non gauge - invariant ( @xmath269 ) functions :    [ prwhl ] @xmath270                                                  \\\\ % p^{\\mu\\nu}_q({\\cal p},q)\\ \\chi_{\\mu\\nu}(p , q ) & = & \\chi^0_q(p , q)\\   + \\",
