    "discrete breathers ( dbs ) , also known as intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) , are genuine nonlinear excitations that oscillate for long times in a localized region of space and may be produced generically in discrete lattices of weakly coupled nonlinear elements ( see @xcite for a general review ) . since their introduction @xcite , a large volume of analytical and numerical studies have explored the existence and the properties of dbs in a variety of discrete nonlinear systems .",
    "rigorous mathematical proofs of existence of dbs in both hamiltonian ( i.e. , energy conserved ) and dissipative lattices of weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators have been given @xcite , and numerical algorithms for their accurate construction have been designed @xcite .",
    "dbs may appear spontaneously in a lattice as result of fluctuations @xcite , disorder @xcite , or by purely deterministic mechanisms @xcite .",
    "they have been observed experimentally in several systems , including solid state mixed - valence transition metal complexes @xcite , quasi - one dimensional antiferromagnetic chains @xcite , arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , micromechanical oscillators @xcite , optical waveguide systems @xcite , and proteins @xcite .",
    "once generated , dbs modify system properties such as lattice thermodynamics and introduce the possibility of nondispersive energy transport @xcite , because of their potential for translatory motion ( i.e. , mobility ) along the lattice @xcite . in numerical experiments",
    "db mobility can be achieved by an appropriate perturbation @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been found experimental evidence for moving dbs in a layered crystal insulator at @xmath0 @xcite and in a small micromechanical cantilever array @xcite . from the perspective of applications to experimental situations where dissipative effects are always present , dissipative db excitations ( usually driven by an alternating power source ) are more relevant than their hamiltonian counterparts .",
    "dissipative dbs , which possess the character of an attractor for initial conditions in the corresponding basin of attraction , may appear whenever power balance , instead of energy conservation , governs the nonlinear dynamics of the lattice .",
    "furthermore , the attractor character of dissipative dbs allows for the existence of quasiperiodic and even chaotic dbs @xcite .",
    "recently , dissipative dbs have been demonstrated numerically in discrete and nonlinear magnetic metamaterials ( mms ) driven by an alternating electromagnetic ( em ) field @xcite .",
    "the mms are artificially structured materials that exhibit em properties not available in naturally occurring materials .",
    "the response of any material ( either natural or artificial ) to applied em fields is characterized by macroscopic parameters such as the electric permittivity @xmath1 and the magnetic permeability @xmath2 .",
    "for example , there are only a few natural materials responding magnetically at terahertz ( thz ) and optical frequencies , and that response is usually very weak .",
    "however the mms exhibit relatively large magnetic response at those frequencies @xcite , which may be either positive or negative , resulting in positive or negative @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the realization of mms at such frequencies will certainly affect thz optics and its applications , while it promises new device applications .",
    "the most common element utilized for magnetic response from mms is the split - ring resonator ( srr ) which , in its simplest form , is a metallic ring with one slit , made of a highly conducting metal .",
    "periodic srr arrays in the nanoscale , a genuine realization of mms , are fabricated routinely using conventional microfabrication techniques .",
    "these mms , in which the srrs are weakly coupled magnetically through their mutual inductances , support a new type of guided waves , the magnetoinductive ( mi ) waves @xcite .",
    "the mi waves propagate within a band near the resonant frequency of the srrs , and exist as forward and backward waves depending on the orientation of the elements ( e.g. , the srrs ) of the mm . in the linear regime of mi wave propagation in a mm , the magnetic permeability @xmath2 does not depend on the intensity of the em field .",
    "however , the mms may become nonlinear , either by embedding the srrs in a kerr - type medium @xcite , or by inserting certain nonlinear elements ( e.g. , diodes ) in each srr @xcite .",
    "then , the combined effects of nonlinearity and discreteness ( inherent in srr - based mms ) , leads in the generation of nonlinear excitations in the form of dbs @xcite , as well as magnetic domain walls @xcite , and magnetoinductive envelope solitons @xcite .",
    "the latter may be both bright or dark , and they result from the modulational instability of the mi wares . while the nonlinearity by itself offers tunability , stationary ( i.e. , not mobile , pinned ) dbs act as stable impurity modes that are dynamically generated and may alter propagation and emission properties of a system .",
    "moreover , stationary dissipative dbs can change locally the magnetic response of a nonlinear mm @xcite .",
    "we should also note that regular arrays of rf squids offer an alternative for the construction of nonlinear mms due to the nonlinearity of the josephson junction @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we investigate numerically the existence and stability of both dissipative and energy conserved dbs in discrete , periodic arrays of nonlinear srrs .",
    "we consider different srr array geometries ( i.e. , different orientations of the srrs in the mm ) in one and two spatial dimensions . in two dimensions we also consider several cases of possible anisotropy . in the next section",
    "we describe the discrete mm model , while in section iii we construct several types of dbs for one - dimensional ( 1d ) arrays . here",
    "we also calculate the magnetic response , which may be locally altered by the presence of a db .",
    "in section iv we construct several types of dbs for two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays , and we finish in section v with the conclusions .",
    "we consider 1d and 2d discrete , periodic arrays of identical nonlinear srrs , which consist the simplest realization of a mm in one and two dimensions @xcite , respectively . in one dimension ,",
    "the srrs form a linear array with their centers separated by distance @xmath3 . in two dimensions , the srrs are assumed to be arranged in a regular rectangular lattice , with their centers separated by distance @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the @xmath6 and @xmath7directions , respectively ( i.e. , lattice constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) .",
    "there are two configurations of interest in each case , shown schematically in figs . 1 and 2 for the 1d and 2d arrays , respectively .",
    "a 1d array can be constructed either in the planar configuration , where all srr loops are in the same plane with their centers lying on a straight line ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , or in the axial configuration , where the line connecting the centers of the srr loops is perpendicular to the plane of the loops ( fig .",
    "similarly , a 2d array can be constructed either in the planar configuration , where all srr loops are in the same plane with their centers located on an orthogonal lattice ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , or in the planar - axial configuration , where all srrs have the planar configuration in one direction while they have the axial configuration in the other direction ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .    within good approximation ,",
    "each srr is equivalent to a nonlinear resistor - inductor - capacitor ( rlc ) circuit featuring a self - inductance @xmath8 , ohmic resistance @xmath9 , and capacitance @xmath10 .",
    "the units ( i.e. , the srrs ) become nonlinear due to a kerr dielectric filling the srrs slits , whose permittivity @xmath1 is of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electric field , @xmath13 is a characteristic ( large ) electric field , @xmath14 is the linear permittivity , @xmath15 is the permittivity of the vacuum , and @xmath16 corresponding to self - focusing ( self - defocusing ) nonlinearity . as a result ,",
    "the srrs acquire a field - dependent capacitance @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the area of the cross - section of the srr wire , @xmath19 is the electric field induced along the srr slit , and @xmath20 is the size of the slit",
    ". the origin of @xmath19 may be due to the magnetic and/or the electric components of the applied em field , depending on the relative orientation of that field with respect to the srrs plane and the slits . in the following",
    "we assume that , for any array configuration and number of dimensions , the magnetic component of the incident ( applied ) em field is always perpendicular to the srrs plane , and that the electric component of the incident em field is transversal to the slit .",
    "then , only the magnetic component excites an electromotive force ( emf ) in the srrs , resulting in an oscillating current in each srr loop and the corresponding development of an oscillating voltage difference @xmath21 across the slits or , equivalently , of an oscillating electric field @xmath19 in the slits .",
    "if @xmath22 is the charge stored in the capacitor of an srr then , from the general relation of a voltage - dependent capacitance , @xmath23 , and eq .",
    "( [ 0 ] ) , we get @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the linear capacitance , and @xmath27 .",
    "assume that the arrays are placed in a time - varying and spatially uniform magnetic field of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the field amplitude , @xmath30 is the field frequency , and @xmath31 is the time variable .",
    "the excited emf @xmath32 , which is the same in all srrs , is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the area of each srr loop , and @xmath35 the permittivity of the vacuum .",
    "each srr in the field given by eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) is a nonlinear oscillator which exhibits a resonant magnetic response ( either positive or negative ) at a particular frequency which is very close to its linear resonance frequency @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 ) .",
    "all srrs in an array are coupled together due to magnetic dipole - dipole interaction through their mutual inductances .",
    "however , we assume below only nearest neighbor interactions , so that neighboring srrs are coupled through their mutual inductances @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is a very good hypothesis in the planar configurations ( i.e. , both in 1d and 2d arrays ) , even if the srrs are very close .",
    "the validity of the nearest neighbor approximation for the other configurations ( i.e. , the axial configuration in 1d arrays and the planar - axial configuration in 2d arrays ) has been checked by taking into account the interaction of the srrs with their four nearest neighbors , using that the mutual inductance @xmath40 between an srr and its @xmath41th neighbor goes like @xmath42 .",
    "we found that for weak coupling , as we consider here , the results are practically the same with those obtained with the nearest neighbor approximation .",
    "thus , the electrical equivalent of an srr array in an alternating magnetic field is that of nonlinear rlc oscillators coupled with their nearest neighbors through their mutual inductances , which are driven by identical alternating voltage sources .",
    "therefore the equations describing the dynamics of the charge @xmath43 and the current @xmath44 circulating in the @xmath45th srr may be derived simply from kirchhoff s voltage law for each srr @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is given implicitly from eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . using the relations @xmath48 and eq . ( [ 02 ] ) , eqs . ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) can be normalized to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the loss coefficient , @xmath51 are the the coupling parameters in the @xmath6 and @xmath7direction , respectively , and @xmath52 .",
    "note that the loss coefficient @xmath53 , which is usually very small ( @xmath54 ) , may account both for ohmic and radiative losses @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equations for 1d arrays result from eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , i.e. , by setting @xmath55 , dropping the subscript @xmath56 , and choosing the appropriate @xmath57 .",
    "neglecting losses and without applied field , eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) can be derived from the hamiltonian @xmath58 where the nonlinear on - site potential @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath62 with the conditions of @xmath63 being real and @xmath64 , gives the approximate expression @xmath65 which is valid for relatively low @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) thus , the on - site potential is soft for @xmath68 and hard for @xmath69 .",
    "in the 2d case the mutual inductances @xmath70 and @xmath71 may differ both in their sign , depending on the configuration , and their magnitude . actually , even in the planar 2d configuration with @xmath72 a small anisotropy should be expected because we considered srrs having only one slit .",
    "this anisotropy can be effectively taken into account by considering slightly different coupling parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the coupling parameters @xmath75 as well as the loss coefficient @xmath53 can be calculated numerically for this specific model within high accuracy . however , for our purposes , it is sufficient to estimate these parameters for realistic ( experimental ) array parameters , ignoring the nonlinearity of the srrs and the effects due to the ( weak ) coupling .",
    "the self - inductance of a circular srr of radius @xmath76 ( with circular cross - section of diameter @xmath77 ) can be determined by the well - known expression @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the value of the capacitance then follows from the choice of the resonance frequency(@xmath79 ) .",
    "the resistance can be calculated from the given srr dimensions and the appropriate value of the conductivity , taking into account the skin effect .",
    "the expression for the mutual inductance between two loops can be calculated by means of a simple approximation @xcite .",
    "for example , for an array of circular silver - made srrs with circular cross - section in the planar geometry , with geometrical and material parameters close to those in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the equivalent squared srr with squared cross - section ) , it has been estimated that @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite . for the same srrs in the axial geometry , separated by distance @xmath3 as those in the planar geometry ,",
    "the approximate expressions for the mutual inductance and the coupling parameter are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "those expressions are obtained by making the same approximations as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and knowing that the magnetic field of one of the srrs with induced current @xmath84 at the center of the other srr , which is directed along its axis , is given by @xmath85 .",
    "thus , in a first approximation , the coupling of two srrs in the axial geometry is stronger ( by a factor of 2 ) than that of the same srrs in the planar geometry .",
    "for the integration of eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , both in the hamiltonian and the damped driven cases , or the corresponding linearized ones , we use a standard fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm with fixed time - stepping @xmath86 ( typically @xmath87 ) . since the dbs studied here are highly localized , the choice of boundary conditions to be imposed on eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) is not especially important .",
    "thus , we have chosen periodic boundary conditions throughout the study .",
    "we consider the two different 1d configurations of srr arrays shown in fig .",
    "1 , with the same number of srr oscillators @xmath88 . within the equivalent circuit model ,",
    "the difference between the two configurations resides in the sign and the magnitude of the coupling parameter @xmath89 . in the planar geometry ( configuration )",
    "@xmath89 is negative , since the mutual inductance @xmath90 between two neighboring srrs is negative .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnetic field generated by one srr ( due to the current induced in its loop ) crosses the neighboring srr in the opposite direction . for the axial geometry ,",
    "the mutual inductance @xmath90 , and hence @xmath89 is positive .",
    "moreover , in a 1d array of srrs in the axial geometry , the value of @xmath89 is much higher than that in a 1d array of srrs in the planar geometry with the same srr spacing @xmath3 .",
    "high coupling between srrs in the axial geometry would possibly require to take into account the interaction of an srr with its far neighbors ( and not only with its nearest neighbors ) . to avoid such complications , and",
    "for the sake of comparison of the dbs obtained in the two geometries , we assume that the srr spacing is such that the magnitude of the coupling between neighboring srrs is the same ( or at least of the same order ) in both geometries .    for hamiltonian systems dbs",
    "may be constructed from the anti - continuous limit @xcite , where all the srrs are uncoupled ( @xmath91 ) , obeying identical dynamical equations .",
    "fixing the amplitude of one of them ( say the one located at @xmath92 ) to a specific value @xmath93 , with the corresponding current @xmath94 , we can determine , either analytically ( if possible ) or numerically , the period of oscillation @xmath95 . an initial condition with @xmath96 for any @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for any @xmath100 , represents a trivial db with period @xmath95 .",
    "continuation of this solution for @xmath101 using the newton s method @xcite , results in numerically exact dbs up to a maximum value of the coupling parameter @xmath102 . for the existence of hamiltonian dbs",
    "it is required that the db frequency @xmath103 , as well as all its multiples , lie outside the linear dispersion band of mi waves .",
    "the mi wave band is obtained by substituting a plane wave of the form @xmath104 into the linearized equations eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) ( with @xmath105 ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the normalized frequency , and @xmath108 is the normalized wavenumber ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "typical dispersion curves are shown in fig . 3 for both geometries . for @xmath110 the band is very narrow ( bandwidth @xmath111 ) , so that the requirement for the existence of hamiltonian dbs can be easily satisfied .",
    "clearly , the bandwidth increases with increasing @xmath89 .",
    "the mi waves are forward in the axial configuration ( @xmath112 ) with co - directional phase and group velocities , and backward in the planar configuration ( @xmath113 ) , with phase and group velocities in the opposite directions .    following the procedure described above , with the appropriate choice of initial conditions ( trivial dbs )",
    ", we have constructed several types of hamiltonian , numerically exact dbs for 1d srr arrays in both the planar and the axial geometries , shown in figs . 4 and 5 for self - focusing ( @xmath68 ) and self - defocusing nonlinearities ( @xmath69 ) , respectively . those hamiltonian db profiles ( shown at maximum amplitude ) , i.e.",

    "4(d ) and 5(d ) ) .",
    "the term `` bright '' ( `` dark '' ) dbs is used when there are only one or a few srrs in which the current oscillates with large ( small ) amplitude , whereas the rest of them oscillate with small ( large ) amplitude @xcite .",
    "all these dbs are highly localized , occupying only a few lattice sites , since they have been obtained for low values of the coupling parameter @xmath89 .",
    "they are all symmetric , except those in figs .",
    "4(b ) and 5(b ) which are anti - symmetric .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , for self - focusing nonlinearity ( @xmath68 ) , the profile of the single - site bright db ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) is staggered ( unstaggered ) for srr arrays in the planar ( axial ) geometry , while , for self - defocusing nonlinearity ( @xmath69 ) , the profile of the single - site bright db ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) is staggered ( unstaggered ) for srr arrays in the axial ( planar ) geometry .",

    "they cease to exist when the mi wave band , which expands with increasing @xmath89 reaches the db frequency @xmath121 . that will occur at @xmath122 , which gives @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "the linear stability of hamiltonian dbs is addressed through the eigenvalues of the floquet matrix ( floquet multipliers ) .",
    "a db is linearly stable when all its floquet multipliers lie on a circle of radius unity in the complex plane .",
    "the dbs shown in figs .",

    "4(d ) and 5(d ) as red squares and black circles , respectively , are linearly unstable .",
    "those dbs were found to be linearly stable only for very low couplings .",
    "next , we construct dbs for srr arrays which are subjected to losses ( damping ) and the external driving force @xmath126 ( dissipative dbs ) . in order to generate dbs in this case",
    "we start by solving eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) in the anti - continuous limit , where all srrs are uncoupled .",
    "we identify two coexisting ( and stable ) attractors of a single damped - driven srr oscillator with focusing nonlinearity ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , which have different amplitudes @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( high and low amplitude attractors , respectively ) .",
    "notice that the frequency @xmath132 is below the srr resonance frequency , where a mm is expected to show only positive magnetic response ( i.e. , response corresponding to positive @xmath2 ) .",
    "subsequently , we fix the amplitude of one of the srr oscillators ( say the one at @xmath92 ) to @xmath133 and all the others to @xmath134 ( @xmath114 are all set to zero ) . using this configuration ( trivial dissipative db ) as initial condition",

    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , while increasing the coupling parameter @xmath89 in small steps . in this way",
    ", the initial condition can be continued for @xmath135 leading to dissipative db formation @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of typical dissipative ( single - site ) bright dbs is shown for srr arrays in the planar and the axial geometries in figs . 6 ( top and bottom panels , respectively ) . we see that both the db and the background are oscillating with different amplitudes ( high and low , respectively ) . in this aspect ,",
    "dissipative dbs differ from their hamiltonian single - site counterparts , where the background is always zero .",
    "we should note here that the db frequency in this case has to be identical with that of the driving field , so that @xmath136 .",
    "however , the phase differences of the srr oscillators in an array with respect to the driving field are generally different , so that a db may change locally the magnetic response of an array , as we shall see below . with appropriate initial conditions",
    "we can also obtain multi - breathers where two or more sites oscillate with high ( low ) amplitude , while the other ones with low ( high ) amplitude .",
    "the linear stability of the dissipative dbs can be addressed ( as in the hamiltonian case ) through the eigenvalues of the floquet matrix ( floquet multipliers ) . in the dissipative case , however , a db is linearly stable when all its floquet multipliers lie on a circle of radius @xmath137 in the complex plane @xcite , due to the presence of a dissipative term in the linearized equations of motion .",
    "both the dissipative dbs shown in fig .",
    "6 are linearly stable . in order to check that result",
    ", we have also added small perturbations to these dbs ( of the order of @xmath138 of the db amplitude ) and let them evolve in time .",
    "we have followed the perturbed dbs over @xmath139 time units observing that the dbs restore their unperturbed shape . in general , dissipative dbs",
    "have been found to exist for couplings @xmath89 much less than those of their hamiltonian counterparts , @xmath140 .",
    "the dbs shown in fig . 6 for dissipative and forced srr arrays in the planar and the axial geometries ,",
    "are found to exist up to @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively . for defocusing nonlinearity ( @xmath69 ) , it was impossible to identify two different amplitude attractors and , thus , we were not able to construct dissipative dbs in this case .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the magnetization in a dissipative srr array . in the direction perpendicular to the srr planes the general relation @xmath143 holds , with @xmath144 the magnetization ( magnetic moment per unit cell volume ) of the array . the earlier equation , with using eq .

    "we observe that , in both geometries , the srr with low amplitude current oscillation ( reduced nonlinearity ) shows positive ( paramagnetic ) response ( figs .",
    "7(a ) and 7(c ) for the planar and the axial geometry , respectively ) , while the srr with high amplitude current oscillation ( enhanced nonlinearity ) shows extreme diamagnetic ( negative ) response ( figs .",
    "7(b ) and 7(d ) for the planar and the axial geometry , respectively ) .",
    "thus , in the breather or multibreather location the lattice has a negative magnetic response even though it is driven below resonance .",
    "that result can be extended to uniform solutions , where @xmath154 for all @xmath100 . without nonlinearity",
    "such a solution always provides positive response below the resonance frequency ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "however , the nonlinearity makes it possible to have two different coexisting and stable states ( bistability ) with low and high amplitude current oscillation , which are in phase and in anti - phase , respectively , with the applied magnetic field .",
    "thus , it is possible to obtain from an srr array uniform negative response below resonance , by exciting all srrs in the array to the high current amplitude state .",
    "these remarks are also valid for 2d srr arrays discussed in the next section .",
    "although most of the methodology and techniques for db construction has been developed for the 1d case , there have been some studies of higher - dimensional systems .",
    "importantly , a rigorous proof of the existence of dbs in higher - dimensional nonlinear lattices was given in ref .",
    "numerical studies of dbs have been published for several simple nonlinear lattices as for example 2d fermi - pasta - ulam chains @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , klein - gordon chains @xcite , discrete nonlinear schrdinger systems @xcite , and also for a morse lattice @xcite . since most of the present mms are fabricated in 2d technology , it is necessary to extend the study of magneto - inductive dbs in two dimensions .",
    "we see below that both the hamiltonian and the dissipative dbs are not destroyed by increasing the dimensionality .",

    "thus , in this case , the 1d hamiltonian dbs with frequencies very close to the 1d band may not survive in the 2d case . typical dispersion curves ( i.e. , contours of the frequency as a function of @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) of linear mi waves for isotropic 2d srr arrays in the planar geometry , anisotropic 2d srr arrays in the planar geometry , and anisotropic 2d srr arrays in the planar - axial geometry , are shown in the left , middle , and right panels of fig . 8 , respectively .    for the construction of dbs in 2d arrays",
    ", we used the same methods as for the corresponding 1d arrays .",
    "we again consider two different geometries of the srr arrays , the planar geometry ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) and the planar - axial geometry ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . in the former geometry ,",
    "the coupling parameters @xmath165 are both negative .",
    "however , they may differ in magnitude , i.e. , @xmath166 as a result of unequal lattice constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 or resulting from the different orientation of the srrs . in the latter geometry ,",
    "the coupling parameters have opposite signs , i.e. , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , which can be regarded as a case of generalized anisotropy .",
    "their magnitude may however be different , depending again on the lattice constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the following",
    "we are mainly concerned with single - site bright dbs for both geometries , nonlinearities ( self - focusing and self - defocusing ) , and several db frequencies and pairs of coupling parameters @xmath165 .",
    "however , one may obtain many different types of dbs by just choosing the appropriate initial condition ( trivial db ) .",
    "the 2d array size used in the calculations is typically @xmath169 .",
    "typical hamiltonian db profiles in 2d isotropic ( @xmath170 ) srr arrays in the planar geometry are shown in fig . 9 for both self - focusing ( figs .",
    "9(a ) - 9(c ) ) and self - defocusing ( figs .",
    "9(d ) - 9(f ) ) nonlinearities .",
    "the db frequencies and coupling parameters are given , for each db , in the caption of fig .",
    "notice that for self - focusing nonlinearity ( @xmath68 ) , the dbs are staggered in both the @xmath6 and the @xmath7directions , while for self - defocusing nonlinearity ( @xmath69 ) , they are unstaggered in both the @xmath6 and the @xmath7directions .",
    "we have constructed exact dbs also in the case of an array in the planar geometry with moderate anisotropy , i.e. , @xmath171 , for both nonlinearities ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "typical db profiles with the coupling parameters differing by approximately @xmath173 are shown in figs .",
    "10(a ) and 10(b ) ( upper panels ) for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the anisotropy does not change the staggered / unstaggered character of these dbs , which remain staggered ( unstaggered ) in both directions for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the lower panels of figs .",
    "10(a ) and 10(b ) show the density plots of the corresponding db profiles shown in the upper panels . in those density plots , where a darker color indicates a higher current amplitude , a db which is staggered in both directions appears as a checkerboard rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the array .",
    "typical hamiltonian db profiles in 2d anisotropic ( @xmath166 ) srr arrays in the planar - axial geometry are shown in figs .",
    "11(a ) and 11(b ) ( upper panels ) for @xmath68 and for @xmath69 , respectively , along with their corresponding density plots ( lower panels ) .",
    "the coupling parameters differ in magnitude by approximately @xmath173 . in this case",
    "we observe that for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) the db is staggered ( unstaggered ) along the @xmath6direction ( @xmath7direction ) , while it is unstaggered ( staggered ) along the @xmath7direction ( @xmath6direction ) .",
    "thus , the change in either the sign of the nonlinearity @xmath174 or the sign of the coupling parameter @xmath74 , leads to a change in the staggered / unstaggered character of a db in the @xmath7direction .",
    "specifically , by changing @xmath174 from + 1 to -1 ( for @xmath175 ) , a db unstaggered in the @xmath7direction becomes staggered in that direction , while by changing @xmath174 from -1 to + 1 ( for @xmath175 ) , a db staggered in the @xmath7direction becomes unstaggered in that direction . also , by changing @xmath74 from positive to negative ( for @xmath68 ) ,",
    "a db unstaggered in the @xmath7direction becomes staggered in that direction , while by changing @xmath74 from negative to positive ( for @xmath68 ) , a db staggered in the @xmath7direction becomes unstaggered in that direction .",
    "the linear stability of all the hamiltonian dbs presented in this section is checked through floquet analysis ( finding the eigenvalues of the floquet matrix ) , and they were found to be linearly stable .",
    "typical examples of dissipative db profiles in 2d isotropic ( @xmath170 ) srr arrays in the planar geometry , 2d anisotropic ( @xmath171 ) srr arrays in the planar geometry , and 2d anisotropic ( @xmath166 ) srr arrays in the planar - axial geometry , are shown in figs .",
    "12(a ) , 12(b ) , and 12(c ) , respectively , for @xmath68 . these profiles are actually snapshots at some specific instant during the db motion . here , just like in the 1d case , both the background and the db ( i.e. , the central db site ) oscillate with low and high current amplitudes , respectively , at the same frequency @xmath176 . the stability of the dissipative dbs has been checked by adding small perturbations of the order of @xmath138 and following their time evolution for long time intervals ( over @xmath177 time units ) . in all cases",
    "it was found that the dbs are not destroyed by the perturbation but , instead , they restore their unperturbed shape .    the magnetic response of the dissipative 2d arrays can be calculated as in the 1d case , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ 13.1 ] ) applied locally at each array cell @xmath178 . in fig .",
    "13 we plot separately the time evolution of each of the three terms of eq.([13.1 ] ) , i.e. , the instantaneous magnetic induction , the applied magnetic field , and the magnetic response , at the central db site ( figs .",
    "13(b ) , 13(d ) and 13(f ) , high amplitude current oscillation ) and the site with @xmath179 ( figs .",
    "13(a ) , 13(c ) and 13(e ) , low amplitude current oscillation ) , for the three dbs shown in fig . 12 .",
    "the results look the same for the first two cases , corresponding to isotropic 2d srr arrays in the planar geometry ( figs .",
    "13(a ) and 13(b ) ) , and anisotropic 2d srr arrays in the planar geometry ( figs . 13(c ) and 13(d ) ) .",
    "they are also similar with those calculated for the corresponding 1d case .",
    "the srrs with low amplitude current oscillation ( @xmath180 ) show positive ( paramagnetic ) response while the srr with high amplitude current oscillation ( central db site ) shows extreme diamagnetic ( negative ) response . in the third case , however , for anisotropic 2d srr arrays in the planar - axial geometry ( figs .",
    "13(e ) and 13(f ) ) , the response of the srr with high amplitude current oscillation is still diamagnetic but not negative .",
    "this is due to the very weak coupling which presumes relatively large separation of the srrs , and thus a very low density srr array .",
    "guided from the previous results , we consider the possibility of constructing a region in a 2d srr array with extreme diamagnetic ( negative ) response , surrounded by a paramagnetic background .",
    "for this purpose we may exploit a bright 2d multibreather consisting of a number of adjacent sites ( srrs ) in the center of the array . for illustration ,",
    "such a multibreather occupying a region of nine sites ( including the central one ) in an isotropic srr array in the planar geometry , is shown in fig .",
    "we have checked that , indeed , the sites with high amplitude current oscillation show negative magnetic response , while the rest of them show positive magnetic response .",
    "thus , it seems possible to create srr - based mms with distinct regions of opposite sign magnetic responses by exploiting multibreathers .",
    "the numerical results for both 1d and 2d srr arrays reveal that , at least for weak coupling , the amplitude and the time - dependence of the central db site and the background are essentially those of the single damped - driven srr oscillator . only the first one or two sites neighboring to the central db site exhibit significant differences due to the coupling .",
    "the bistability of the single srr oscillator , which is important for the construction of dissipative dbs and also for the creation of uniform states with either positive or negative magnetic response below resonance , is not restricted to frequencies close to resonance . in fig .",
    "15 we show the time evolution of @xmath114 of two coexisting and stable states far from resonance , along with the normalized driving magnetic field .",
    "dissipative dbs can be constructed by combining these two states into a trivial db and continuing that solution for finite ( non - zero ) coupling parameters .",
    "although for the cases shown the current of the high amplitude current state is rather large , where the saturation of the nonlinear term could be expected , fig .",
    "15 indicates that it is possible to obtain negative response below resonance by exciting the srrs in that state .",
    "we considered a simple model for nonlinear srr - based mms in one and two dimensions , where the nonlinearity arises from a kerr - type dielectric which fills the srr slits .",
    "each srr , which is modeled as a nonlinear rlc electrical circuit driven by an alternating voltage source , is weakly coupled to its nearest neighbors due to magnetic dipole - dipole interactions through their mutual inductance @xmath90 ( magnetoinductive coupling ) .",
    "the sign of the coupling between neighboring srrs depends on their relative orientation within the srr array .",
    "we have constructed , using standard numerical methods , many different types of hamiltonian and dissipative dbs both in 1d and 2d arrays for different nonlinearities ( i.e. , self - focusing and self - defocusing ) , and different geometries ( planar and axial in 1d , planar and planar - axial in 2d ) .",
    "we have also constructed dbs in 2d arrays with moderate anisotropy .",
    "most of the dbs presented here are linearly stable under small perturbations .",
    "dissipative srr arrays , driven by an applied magnetic field , offer the possibility to study their magnetic response with respect to that field .",
    "the induced current oscillations are proportional to the magnetic moments of the srrs and , thus , to the local magnetization ( magnetic response ) of the array .",
    "we found that low ( high ) amplitude current oscillations are in phase ( almost in anti - phase ) with the applied field .",
    "thus , depending on the array and the external field parameters , the magnetic response at the srrs with high amplitude current oscillation can be negative . in this way",
    ", dbs can change locally the magnetic response of the array from paramagnetic to extreme diamagnetic . by exploiting multibreathers",
    ", it seems possible to create srr - based mms with distinct regions of opposite sign magnetic responses .",
    "the bistability due to the nonlinearity is not restricted to frequencies close to resonance , but it is found to persist down to much lower frequencies . as a result , dissipative dbs with frequencies and external field amplitudes in rather wide intervals can be constructed .",
    "moreover , even far from resonance , the coexisting and stable low and high current amplitude states are in phase and in anti - phase , respectively , with the applied magnetic field .",
    "thus , it seems possible to get uniform solutions at these low frequencies , which provide either positive or negative magnetic response below resonance .",
    "this could be achieved by exciting all the srrs in the low or high amplitude state , respectively .",
