    "gravity inversion reconstructs models of subsurface density distribution using measured data on the surface .",
    "there are two important ambiguities in the inversion of gravity data .",
    "theoretical ambiguity is caused by the nature of gravity ; many equivalent sources in the subsurface can produce the same data at the surface .",
    "algebraic ambiguity occurs when parameterization of the problem creates an underdetermined situation with more unknowns than observations .",
    "then , there is no unique density distribution which satisfies the observed data .",
    "further , the measurement process at the earth s surface is necessarily error - contaminated and such errors can introduce arbitrarily large changes in the reconstructed solutions ; namely the solutions are sensitive to errors in the measurements .",
    "thus , the inversion of gravity data with under sampling is a typical example of an ill - posed problem that requires the inclusion of a priori information in order to find a feasible reconstruction .",
    "tikhonov regularization is a well - known and well - studied method for stabilizing the solutions of ill - posed problems , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the objective function of the tikhonov formulation includes a data fidelity ( misfit term ) , and a stabilizing term that controls the growth of the solution with respect to a chosen weighted norm . the choice of the weighting for the regularization term impacts the properties of the solution .",
    "for example , a smoothing stabilizer which employs the first or second derivative of the model parameters , such as used in ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? *",
    "e.g. ) produces smooth images of the subsurface density distribution .",
    "there are , however , situations in which the potential field sources are localized and have material properties that vary over relatively short distances .",
    "then , a regularization that does not not penalize sharp boundaries should be used .",
    "@xcite presented a compactness criteria for gravity inversion that seeks to minimize the volume of the causative body .",
    "this concept was developed by introducing minimum support ( ms ) and minimum gradient support ( mgs ) stabilizers @xcite , @xcite , which are applied iteratively , generating repeatedly updated weighted quadratic stabilizers .    in any regularization method ,",
    "the trade off between the data fit and the regularization term is controlled by a regularization parameter .",
    "methods to find this regularization parameter , called parameter - choice methods , can be divided into two classes @xcite : ( i ) those that are based on knowledge of , or a good estimate of , the error in the observations , such as morozov s discrepancy principle ( mdp ) , and ( ii ) those that , in contrast , seek to extract such information from the observations , such as the l - curve or generalized cross - validation ( gcv ) methods .",
    "the use of the mdp is dominant in papers related to potential field inversion , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , and the original paper for focusing inversion @xcite . in many practical applications , little knowledge about",
    "the noise or error in the data measurements is available .",
    "the mdp then reduces to a trial and error procedure for finding the optimal regularization parameter @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the use of the l - curve and gcv methods for use in focusing inversion of gravity data in situations in which there is information about the relative magnitudes of the standard deviations across the measured data @xcite . due to the iterative nature of the algorithm",
    ", the regularization parameter is determined each iteration .",
    "depending on the type of problem to be tackled , gravity inversion can be carried out either in two or three dimensions ( 2-d or 3-d ) .",
    "2-d methods are suitable for the recovery of geologic structures such as faults , dikes and rift zones for which the length of the source body in one direction is much longer than its extension in other directions .",
    "then , it may be possible to consider the gravitational sources as completely invariant in the direction parallel to the length direction . additionally , 2-d sources are both easier to conceptualize and model than their 3-d counterparts , @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we review the derivation of the analytic calculation of the gravity anomaly derived from a 2-d cell model and then present an overview of numerical methods for focusing inversion .",
    "the use , and rationale for the use , of the generalized singular value decomposition , @xcite , for the solution is given in section  [ gsvdsec ] .",
    "the l - curve and gcv parameter - choice methods are discussed in section  [ regparam ] .",
    "results for synthetic data are illustrated in section  [ results ] .",
    "the approach is applied on a profile of gravity data acquired from the safo mining camp in maku - iran in section  [ realresults ] .",
    "future directions and conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "a simple 2-d model is obtained by dividing the subsurface under the survey area in to a large number of infinitely long horizontal prisms in the invariant @xmath0direction , with variations in densities only assumed for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions .",
    "the cross - section of the subsurface under the gravity profile for the model is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] in which the cells have square cross section and unknown densities .",
    "the dimensions of the cells are equal to the distances between two observation points and the unknown density is considered to be constant for each block .",
    "this type of parameterization , originally used by @xcite , could indeed be improved . yet , increasing the resolution of the models , and hence the number of parameters , by dividing the subsurface into smaller cells , makes the problem more ill - posed . here the unknown density is considered to be constant for each block and the data and model parameters are linearly related .    the cross - section of the subsurface under the gravity profile .",
    "gravity stations are located at the centers of the blocks at the ground surface , indicated by the @xmath3 symbols .",

    "a solution of this integral for an @xmath8-sided polygon is given by , @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "the purpose of the gravity inverse problem is to find a geophysically plausible density model that reproduces @xmath21 .",
    "the conventional method for solving ill - posed inverse problems as described by is based on minimization of the parametric functional @xmath25 here @xmath26 measures the data fidelity , which is usually measured by the weighted discrepancy @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the vector of predicted data , @xmath29 contains the observations and @xmath30 is a data weighting matrix . under the assumption that the noise @xmath24 is gaussian and uncorrelated , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the standard deviation of the noise in the @xmath16th datum .",
    "following @xcite , rather than always assuming that the absolute magnitudes of the error are known , we assume that the relative magnitudes of the error can be estimated",
    ". then for an unknown @xmath33 each @xmath32 is reexpressed as @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in @xmath36",
    "is a stabilizing regularization functional and @xmath37 is a regularization parameter .",
    "different choices are possible for @xmath36 . here",
    "we use the minimum support ( ms ) stabilizer introduced in @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "this stabilizer generates a compact image of a geophysical model with sharp boundaries and , following @xcite , is of the form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are diagonal matrices of the current model parameters @xmath22 and an estimate of the model parameters @xmath41 .",
    "if good prior knowledge of the properties of the subsurface distribution exists , a full model of the expected physical properties can be used for @xmath41 , otherwise it is often set to @xmath42 . in @xmath43 , @xmath44 is a focusing parameter that is introduced to provide stability as @xmath45 component wise .",
    "small values for @xmath46 lead to compact models but also increase the instability in the solution . for large @xmath46",
    "the image will not be focused . in general",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath47 .",
    "a trade - off curve method can be used to select @xmath46 , @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in potential data inversion the reconstructed models tend to concentrate near the surface .",
    "the depth weighting matrix , @xmath48 introduced in @xcite can then be incorporated into the stabilizer term . here",
    "@xmath49 is the mean depth of cell @xmath17 and @xmath50 is a small number imposed to avoid singularity at the surface .",
    "the choice for @xmath51 is important .",

    "if field operation geological and geophysical information are able to provide the value of the density of cell @xmath17 this information should be included in @xmath41 .",
    "then , @xmath53 is the diagonal identity matrix but with @xmath54 for those diagonal entries @xmath17 for which information on the density is known .    combining the diagonal weighting matrices , @xmath53 , @xmath43 and @xmath55 ,",
    "is replaced by @xmath56 to obtain solution @xmath57 linear transformation of the original model parameters is introduced via @xmath58 .",

    "based on geologic information , upper and lower bounds , @xmath69 , can be determined for the model parameters .",
    "if during the iterative process a given density value falls outside the bounds , projection is employed to force the value back to the exceeded value , and a hard constraint is imposed at that cell via @xmath54 .",
    "we now discuss the numerical procedure for finding the solution to . for large scale problems ,",
    "iterative methods such as conjugate gradients , or other krylov methods should be employed to find @xmath70 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . for small scale problems",
    "it is feasible to use the singular value decomposition ( svd ) for the matrix @xmath71 , when matrix @xmath72 is the identity .",
    "otherwise the generalized singular value decomposition ( gsvd ) , @xcite , is needed . but again is effective to use for this problem because it facilitates efficient determination of the regularization parameter .",
    "we assume @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the null space of matrix @xmath78 .",
    "then there exist orthogonal matrices @xmath79 , @xmath80 and a nonsingular matrix @xmath81 such that @xmath82 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 of size @xmath85 is zero except for entries @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 is diagonal of size @xmath89 with entries @xmath90 .",
    "the generalized singular values of the matrix pair @xmath78 , @xmath72 are @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 .    using the gsvd , introducing @xmath98 as the @xmath16th column of matrix @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we may immediately write the solution of as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the @xmath16th column of the inverse of the matrix @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the filter factors",
    ". therefore the algorithm proceeds by first updating the matrix @xmath43 at step @xmath61 using , calculating the gsvd for the matrix pair @xmath105 $ ] and then updating @xmath66 using which depends on @xmath67 .    three criteria are used to terminate the iterative procedure . following @xcite the iteration is seen to have converged and is thus terminated when either ( i ) a sufficient decrease in the functional is observed , @xmath106 , or ( ii ) the change in the density satisfies @xmath107 .",
    "if neither of these conditions is satisfied by an upper limit on the number of iterations , the procedure is terminated without convergence as measured in this manner . the parameter @xmath108 is taken as @xmath109 for the inversions considered here .",
    "the remaining issue is the determination of the regularization parameter at each step of the iteration .",
    "as noted , when a priori information in the form of the standard deviations on the noise in the data is available , the mdp can be used to find @xmath37 . here , in the absence of the exact information on the error in the data we investigate the use of the l - curve and gcv methods to find @xmath67 for which the formulation using the gsvd is advantageous .",
    "the l - curve approach developed by @xcite for linear inverse problems is a robust criterion for determining the regularization parameter .",
    "it is based on the trade - off between the norm of the regularized solution and the norm of the corresponding fidelity term residual as the regularization parameter varies . according to @xcite",
    "when these two norms are plotted on a log - log scale , the curve has an l shape with an obvious corner .",
    "this corner separates the flat and vertical parts of the curve where the solution is dominated by regularization errors and perturbation errors , respectively . picking @xmath110 as the @xmath37 responsible for the corner point gives the optimal trade off between the two terms , and the corresponding model is selected as the optimal solution . for @xmath111 the regularized solution",
    "does not change dramatically , while the residual does .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath112 the regularized solution increases rapidly with little decrease in the residual .",
    "because of the relation of @xmath110 with the shape of the curve , @xcite recommends estimating @xmath110 by finding the maximum of the local curvature in the neighborhood of the dominant corner of the plot .",
    "although the l - curve technique can be robust for problems generating well - defined corners , it may not work so well in other cases .",
    "for an underdetermined problem the recovered model can change more slowly with the degree of regularization , @xcite , and the l - curve is thus smoother .",
    "this makes it difficult to find maximum point of curvature of the curve . on the other hand ,",
    "given the solution of the regularized problem in terms of the gsvd , as in , finding the l - curve is relatively efficient and is thus one of the conventional ways to estimate @xmath110 .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the l - curve choice for @xmath113 at early iterations may be too small which may lead to inclusion of excessive structure in the model that needs to be eventually removed , hence requiring more iterations for the inversion . hence here we follow the approach suggested by @xcite and impose a so - called _ cooling _ process in which @xmath67 is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the point of maximum curvature of the l - curve .",
    "moreover , choosing a relatively large value for @xmath117 improves the performance of the algorithm .",
    "we use @xmath118 and @xmath119 which work well for the presented inversion examples .",
    "the major motivation of using the gcv to find an optimal value for @xmath37 is that a good value should predict missing data values .",
    "specifically , if an arbitrary measurement is removed from the data set , then the corresponding regularized solution should be able to predict the missing observation .",
    "the choice of @xmath37 should be independent of an orthogonal transformation of the data , @xcite .",
    "the gcv functional is given by @xmath120 where the final expressions follow immediately from the gsvd , with @xmath121 . here",
    "the numerator is the squared residual norm and the denominator is effectively the square of the number of degrees of freedom , @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the value of @xmath37 which minimizes the expected value of the gcv function is near the minimizer of the expected value of the predictive mean - square error , @xmath122 , @xcite .",
    "hence , finding the minimum for @xmath123 should lead to a reasonable estimate for @xmath37 .",
    "we have seen in our experiments that when the gcv does not fail , in which case it produces a very small @xmath37 , it usually leads to @xmath37 which is slightly larger than the optimal value .",
    "failure occurs when @xmath123 is almost flat near the optimal alpha , leading to numerical difficulties in computing its minimum .",
    "the _ cooling _ procedure , as described for the l - curve , is also applied to the gcv estimation of @xmath67 but with @xmath116 now chosen as the current minimum of the gcv function . for clarity",
    "we summarize the steps of the inversion that are applied every iteration in algorithm  [ alg1 ] . here",
    "we state this for the l - curve method .",
    "the gcv solutions are found equivalently but at all steps using the l - curve instead the gcv method is applied .",

    "2 .   calculate the solutions , and the associated l - curve function , for a range of @xmath37 , the optimal @xmath37 is found using the l - curve .",
    "the cooling process is implemented for deciding whether the obtained @xmath37 from step 2 should be used or not .",
    "4 .   with @xmath37 from step 3 ,",
    "the model parameters are computed using equation .",
    "density limits are implemented on model parameters , from step 4 , and then @xmath43 and @xmath53 are updated .",
    "data misfit , @xmath36 and @xmath125 are computed for model parameters obtained from step 5 .",
    "if the termination criteria are satisfied the iteration terminates . otherwise , the a priori density model is set equal to the density model from step 5 and the iteration returns to step 1 .",
    "we evaluated the use of the l - curve and gcv in focusing inversion , as described in sections  [ lc ] and [ gcv ] , for several synthetic data examples . in these simulations data",
    "are calculated at @xmath126 stations with @xmath127 m spacing on the surface and the inversion is required at the subsurface on a rectangular grid of @xmath128 with cell size @xmath127 m , hence in this case @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the iterations are initialized with @xmath63 , @xmath131 and bound constraints on the density are set such that @xmath132 .",
    "the focusing parameter is fixed as @xmath133 for the inversions .",
    "it should be noted that the regularization parameter depends on the choice for @xmath46 , a large value requires a larger value for @xmath37 and generates a smoother model . in these simulations",
    "the maximum number of iterations is set to @xmath134 .",
    "the synthetic gravity data are generated in each case for the rectangular body that has density contrast equal to @xmath135 with an homogeneous background , figure  [ 3a ] . in generating noise - contaminated data we use zero mean gaussian noise with a standard deviation @xmath136 , as indicated in figure  [ 3b ] for @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in each case",
    "we calculated the @xmath139 measure of the actual noise in the noisy data and report the data fidelity values , relative error @xmath140 , and final values @xmath141 for each inversion in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the density models obtained for the first data set , figure  [ 3b ] are presented in figures  [ 5a ] and [ 5b ] for the l - curve and gcv inversions , respectively . in each case",
    "the geometry and density of the reconstructed models are close to those of the original model , although the inversion using the l - curve criterion is more focused .",
    "this feature was present in all the examples we have analyzed ; inversion using gcv always provides a smoother reconstruction than that obtained using the l - curve .",
    "figures  [ 6a]-[6b ] demonstrate the progression of the solutions with iteration @xmath61 for the data fidelity @xmath142 , the stabilizer @xmath143 , the parametric functional @xmath144 , and regularization parameter , @xmath67 , again for the l - curve and gcv respectively for this first example . in our experience",
    "the behavior indicated is consistent when using the gcv to find the regularization parameter @xmath37 ; it generally decreases initially , but then increases to converge to a fixed value by the maximum number of iterations . on the other hand , for the l - curve",
    "the progression of @xmath67 is more erratic , generally oscillating in final iterations toward a converged value as shown in figure  [ 6a ] .",
    "manual intervention may then be needed to force the overall convergence of the algorithm @xcite .",
    "the main problem for the l - curve , as mentioned in section section  [ lc ] , is its smooth shape , that makes it difficult to find the corner , namely the point of maximum curvature . to illustrate we plot the l - curve for all iterations in figure  [ 5a ] , showing that overall the approach is successful , although at a given middle iteration the apparent corner is missed , figure  [ 5c ] .",
    "still the starting and final iterations in figure  [ 5b ] and figure  [ 5d ] do find useful corners .",
    "the same formulation was used to generate two further synthetic data sets , with quantitative results shown also in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "noise generated using @xmath145 and @xmath146 was considered , with in both cases @xmath138 .",
    "the results of the inversions are illustrated in figures  [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , respectively .",
    "we note from table  [ tab1 ] that the fidelity values at convergence are less than the initial @xmath139 measure of the noise , that always @xmath147 , but that there is no fixed conclusion about the relation between the final relative errors and fidelity estimates by the l - curve and gcv inversions .",
    "we conclude that both the gcv and the l - curve are successful in providing reasonable solutions .",
    "it should be noted that increasing the focusing parameter @xmath46 can yield solutions which are not focused , especially as shown in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    ".relative error and final values of the regularization parameter for the inverted models .",

    "we see that the solutions are more focused , as anticipated from the previous work of @xcite but the relative error overall is increased and the fidelity of the solution is also decreased . on the other hand ,",
    "it is of greater interest for the purposes of this study to observe that the performance of the parameter choice techniques is independent of the upper bound , and the parameters are found stably independent of the constraint bounds . to determine the necessity of using the ms instead of a smoothness stabilizer",
    ", we also considered the results obtained using smoothness stabilizer , i.e. the @xmath43 in replaced with the approximation for the second derivative of the model parameters , for the situations in figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig8new ] .",
    "these results are also detailed in table  [ tab1 ] and illustrated in figures  [ 9anew]-[9bnew ] and [ 9cnew]-[9dnew ] , respectively .",
    "they demonstrate the relative insensitivity to density limits of the smoothness - stabilizer obtained solutions . on the other hand ,",
    "the solutions lack the contrast that is achieved using the ms regularization .",
    "overall , the solutions obtained with gcv are apparently more robust than those with the l - curve .",
    "it should be noted that using a non-@xmath151 measure of the derivative in geophysical inversion leads to a strongly piecewice constant , or blocky , reconstruction with sharp jumps , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "the gravity survey was performed by the gravity branch of the institute of geophysics , university of tehran .",
    "the measurements were corrected for effects caused by instruments and tidal drift , latitude , free air and the bouguer correction to yield the bouguer gravity anomaly , figure  [ 9a ] .",
    "the bouguer anomaly displays extreme magnitudes in the central of the area in the north - south direction , related to mineral occurrence which has high density contrast with the host rocks .",
    "this geologic structure is therefore clearly suitable for using a 2-d algorithm .",
    "the residual anomaly was obtained by subtracting the regional anomaly from the bouguer anomaly using a polynomial fitting method , figure  [ 9b ] .",
    "one of the recommended steps in potential field inversion is upward continuation of data to a height of half the thickness of the shallowest cell which removes near surface effects without noticeably degrading the data .",

    "for this small - scale problem , it is shown that the gsvd can be used in the algorithm , demonstrating the filtering of the solution . moreover ,",
    "this use of the gsvd , which might generally be assumed to be too expensive , is beneficial and worthwhile in the context of regularization parameter estimation as shown here . for large - scale problems",
    "it is anticipated that a randomized gsvd needs to be developed , along the lines of the randomized svd that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "finally the method was used on a profile of gravity data acquired over the safo manganese mine in the northwest of iran .",
    "the result shows a density distribution in subsurface from about @xmath160 m to @xmath170 m in depth and about @xmath169 m horizontally .",
    "future work will consider the inclusion of statistical weighting in the solution and the use of regularization parameter estimation using statistical approaches , @xcite .",
