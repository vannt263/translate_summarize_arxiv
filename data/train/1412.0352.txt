    "similarly , a positive factorization of a boundary multitwist @xmath15 , i.e. the mapping class @xmath16 for @xmath17 boundary parallel curves , describes a genus @xmath3 _ lefschetz pencil _ with @xmath4 base points .",
    "conversely , given any allowable lefschetz fibration or a lefschetz pencil , one obtains such a factorization .",
    "the main questions we will take on in this article are the following :    * q1 * _ when does the page @xmath18 of an open book impose an a priori bound on the euler characteristics of allowable lefschetz fibrations with regular fiber @xmath19 filling it ?",
    "_    * q2 * _ when does the fiber @xmath20 and a positive integer @xmath4 imply an a priori bound on the euler characteristics of allowable lefschetz pencils with regular fiber @xmath19 and @xmath4 base points ? when it does , what is the largest possible euler characteristic ?",

    "since @xmath23 for any stein filling @xmath24 , the question  @xmath25 above , _ up to stabilizations _ , amounts to asking when the page of an open book ( i.e. its genus @xmath3 and number of binding components @xmath4 ) on a contact @xmath1-manifold implies a uniform bound on the topology of its stein fillings . on the other hand ,",
    "the question  @xmath26 can be seen as a special version of question  @xmath25 with page @xmath5 and the particular monodromy @xmath27 .",

    "( as _ the _ length , in this paper ) of a mapping class @xmath12 , which we denote by @xmath28 , is defined to be the supremum taken over the lengths of all possible positive factorizations of @xmath12 along nonseparating curves , and it is @xmath29 if @xmath12 does not admit any positive factorization .",
    "@xmath30 is a superadditive function on @xmath6 taking values in @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath32 translates to having the uniform bound in the above questions .",

    "; for every pair of fixed positive integers @xmath44 , theorem  a allows us to tell ( i ) if there are any symplectic @xmath0-manifolds admitting a genus-@xmath3 lefschetz pencil with @xmath4 base points ( and with only irreducible singular fibers ) , ( ii ) when the euler characteristic of these @xmath0-manifolds can get arbitrarily large , and ( iii ) if bounded , what the largest euler characteristic exactly is .",
    "parts ( i ) and ( ii ) completely answer the question  5.1 in @xcite . in the course of the proof , we will note that only symplectic @xmath0-manifolds of general type , i.e. of kodaira dimension @xmath26 , realize arbitrarily large euler characteristic .",

    "this determines @xmath28 on the nose .",
    "notice that combining the above with a theorem of wendl @xcite we recover the following theorem of @xcite : _ if the open book prescribed by @xmath74 , @xmath49 is stably equivalent to a planar open book , then @xmath75 is finite . _",
    "equivalently , a mapping class @xmath74 , @xmath49 with @xmath92 can not be stably equivalent to a mapping class @xmath93 , for any @xmath94 .",
    "we now move on to producing particular mapping classes with prescribed finite lengths in @xmath6 for any @xmath95 , for which we first review the notion of right - veering @xcite .",

    "if the oriented path from @xmath107 to @xmath108 , avoiding @xmath102 , has the same orientation as the boundary orientation induced by the disk , then @xmath97 is to the right of @xmath96 .",

    "such lefschetz fibrations on symplectic calabi yau @xmath172 surfaces are constructed in @xcite ; also see @xcite[proof of theorem  3.10 ] .",

    "the exceptions occur in low genera cases which is essentially due to positive factorizations being lifts of quasipositive braid factorizations , where for the latter , it is known that the degree of a factorization determines the length of all possible factorizations",

    "the quotient of @xmath496 under the hyperelliptic involution gives the disk with @xmath497 marked points . since any @xmath498 commutes with the hyperelliptic involution , it gives a mapping class of the disk with @xmath497 marked points .",

    "now for @xmath175 , let @xmath502 in @xmath495 . by the above observation , @xmath12 has finite length in this subgroup . on the other hand",
    ", we have the @xmath25-boundary component chain relation : @xmath503 it is easy to see that by applying braid relators successively , we get @xmath504 where @xmath505 is a positive word that consists of products of conjugates of @xmath506 . by the @xmath26-boundary chain relation , @xmath507 , which is a mapping class with infinite length .",
    "it follows that @xmath12 has infinite length in @xmath473 , even though it has finite length in the subgroup @xmath495 .",
