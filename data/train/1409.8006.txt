    "materials with two dimensional honeycomb lattice represent an interesting class of low dimensional systems with many intriguing electronic structure properties .",
    "one such example is graphene in which the conducting electrons act as massless fermions at low temperatures . owing to this unique feature  @xcite , a number of remarkable phenomena such as the topological mott - insulator transition @xcite and quantum spin liquid @xcite , @xcite have already been discovered to be realizable in this two dimensional honeycomb system .",
    "the dispersion relation corresponding to these massless dirac fermions at low energies near the fermi level can be described by a relativistic hubbard - like hamiltonian linear in terms of the momentum vector @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "+ the interaction term in the hubbard model plays a crucial role . in non interaction case ,",
    "the honycomb system is in a half - filling semi - metal phase . increasing the on - site interaction in the system ,",
    "many scenarios can be realized .",
    "for example , a number of methods including , the gutzwiller , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) and exact diagonalization ( ed ) methods at zero or finite temperature predict semi - metal to insulator transition ( smit ) or semi - metal to anti - ferromagnetic mott insulator transition at different critical interactions@xcite . among these methods , the so - called dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) is proven to be a powerful tool , allowing us to find metal to insulator transition in the context of the strongly correlated systems .",
    "this method is exact at infinite dimension @xcite . in finite dimension",
    ", however , dmft neglects nonlocal correlations . by exclusion of this term ,",
    "one can , for example , notice a difference in the value of the on - site coulomb term @xmath1 as predicted by the cluster dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft ) and as obtained by dmft @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , the phase smit in honeycomb lattice is studied using dmft coupled with ed method at zero temperature . in this method , we first map hubbard model to anderson impurity model and create a single impurity model .",
    "the new model is then solved exactly with an effective bath , approximated by a few orbitals @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that in the metallic state , according to the fermi liquid theory , the increase of the on - site interaction leads to an increase in the renormalized mass of electrons and , consequently , they tend to be localized .",
    "this is the basis of brinkman - rice theory of mit @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario can not be applicable for the massless electrons in graphene s honeycomb lattice . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the renormalized fermi velocity is instead used which is proportional to quasi - particle weight at low energy @xcite . as a case study",
    ", we consider a toy density of states ( tdos ) model and examine the effects of interaction on shape of density of states ( dos ) and phase transition point .",
    "the bar toy dos has same properties as dos of honeycomb lattice at @xmath2 . in critical @xmath3",
    "we can see a gap in dos at zero energy , implying mit .",
    "the other quantity which is obtained is renormalized fermi velocity . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the massless electrons become localized and renormalized fermi velocity goes to zero .",
    "we have further used ed method on honeycomb lattice to analyze mit in this system .",
    "the ground state of impurity model and the occupancy at impurity site , at @xmath5 are obtained . for @xmath6",
    ", it is shown that mit takes place .",
    "the two dimensional hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice ( hcl ) is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and @xmath9 are the creation ( annihilation ) operator of electrons at site i with spin @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the number operator and determines the number of electrons at site i with projection of spin @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath12 is the chemical potential and @xmath13 designates the on - site electron - electron repulsion energy .",
    "we take @xmath8 as the energy unit through out this paper , we will consider the half filling case ( @xmath12 = @xmath13/2 ) .    as already mentioned",
    "dmft @xcite is exact in the limit of infinite lattice coordinations , where nonlocal correlations become frozen . in finite dimension",
    "this correlations exist but are neglected by dmft method",
    ". the use of dmft for study of 2d hubbard model on honeycomb lattice may accordingly be questionable since this lattice has only 3 coordinations .",
    "however , cdmft applied on a square lattice shows that the mit in 2d lattice are captured by single site dmft @xcite . in limit of infinite dimensions ,",
    "the self - energy thus becomes local function and independent of the momentum but in finite dimension it can be neglected .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is a bipartite system so the self - energy is written in dmft as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is matsubara frequency and the interacting single site green s function has the following matrix form , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the non interacting green s function @xcite @xmath18 the local green s function of the original lattice on hubbard model is obtained by summation over @xmath19 @xmath20 and we can further convert summation to integration @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bare density of state @xcite . in dmft formalism one can describe 2d hubbard model by the anderson impurity model to describe the dynamics of the local impurity on site _",
    "i _ coupled to free conduction electrons in the bath .",
    "the anderson impurity hamiltonian is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the index for bath levels and @xmath25 corresponds to impurity level .",
    "the impurity green s function @xmath26 , is calculated by the exact diagonalization of the anderson hamiltonian .",
    "we used the dyson s equation for calculation of the bare green s function @xmath27 which represents effective mean field acting on impurity site @xmath28 in ed method at @xmath2 , the impurity green s function is approximated by the finite numbers of bath levels @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the bath conduction levels , in the present study we consider @xmath31 .",
    "the anderson parameters set @xmath32 is chosen such that the _ distance function _ between the continuous bath function ( original lattice ) @xmath27 and the discretized bath function ( impurity model ) @xmath33 is minimized .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is a large upper cutoff , ( here @xmath36).the parameter @xmath0 is very important when we have small number of bath levels , and if chosen large ( e.g. k = 3 ) , enhances the importance of the lowest matsubara frequencies in the minimization procedure @xcite . above equations are the basic equations for the the self - consistent solution in ed method . below we describe our approach in more detail .",
    "+ first we use initial set of anderson parameters , then @xmath33 and @xmath26 are calculated by ( [ impbg ] ) and diagonalization by ( [ aim ] ) , respectively .",
    "the self - energy is obtained by dyson equation , ( @xmath37 ) . in second step",
    "@xmath38 is calculated by ( [ egf]-[integf ] ) , new bar green s function is constructed from ( [ desoneq ] ) . for the sake of faster convergence one could use @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . at final step ,",
    "a new anderson parameters is obtained by minimization of distance function [ disf ] ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this cycle is repeated until @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "after convergence , it is possible to extract the desired observable and physical quantities _",
    "e.g. _ dos , quasi - particle weight and double occupancy .",
    "in this paper we first calculated the local green s function of the honeycomb lattice ( [ integf ] ) .",
    "the density of states per unit cell for non interacting honeycomb lattice is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "close to the dirac point , the dispersion is approximated by @xmath46 and dos is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the unit cell area , and @xmath49 is the fermi velocity @xcite . in the following a toy dos ( which is conceptually similar to dos of graphene and basically represents the same properties @xcite ) is used , @xmath50 in ed method dos is approximated by a set of delta functions .",
    "this is because in this method a finite number of conduction levels in the effective bath are used .",
    "the calculated results are accordingly compared with those reported in ref .",
    "insert tdos in dmft process and increasing on - site interaction , the upper and lower hubbard bands are made and the singularity ( for similarity with van - hove singularity ) is moved to lower energy , see fig.[tdos.fig ] . as expected ,",
    "because of delta functions shape of dos , we could not see any change in fermi velocity by increasing @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the quasi - particle weight is the physical quantity for analysis of mit according to brinkman - rice theory @xcite , but in the honeycomb lattice quasi - particles are massless ( we have smit ) , so this theory could not be applicable here , instead we have used the renormalized fermi velocity factor @xcite which have the same role in smit , @xmath51 since the slope of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are identical in @xmath54 limit , so the @xmath55 and @xmath56 have similar treatments at low frequency . in fig .",
    "[ zf.fig ] we plot fermi velocity renormalized of tdos for weak and strong couplings .",
    "it is found that for @xmath57 this factor goes to zero .",
    "this shows that the system is in the insulating phase @xcite .",
    "+ the final result of ed for toy model predicts @xmath58 for smit but in previous dmft calculations by ipt method @xmath1 is found to be larger .",
    "this is due to the fact that ipt usually overestimates this critical value @xcite .",
    "we next compute the green s function of system @xmath59 using continued - fraction expansion and ground - state by lanczos method .",
    "the double occupancy is then obtained directly by @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath61 is proportional to susceptibility , @xmath62 , so when curvature of @xmath63 changes , a singularity occurs in susceptibility of the system , implying that the system has undergone a phase transition .",
    "we already know @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the free energy .",
    "this means that the singularity in susceptibility corresponds to a second order phase transition @xcite . in fig.[docg.fig ] we have accordingly plotted double occupancy for weak and stronge interactions .",
    "the phase transition point cab be seen near @xmath66 .",
    "the renormalized fermi velocity for honeycomb lattice is shown in fig.[zg.fig ] , the critical on - site interaction is predicted to be between @xmath67 , in accordance with that described for fig.[docg.fig ] .",
    "the previous works based on hubbard model have found phase transition in the honeycomb lattice at various @xmath1 values : the quantum monte carlo method used by @xcite predicted a semi - metal ( sm ) to anti ferromagnetic transition ( aft ) , followed by a subsequent transition to mott insulator at @xmath68 . in the other qmc study considering the broken symmetry through second - order perturbation theory",
    ", the authors found the same sm - aft phase transition at @xmath69 for infinite dimensional diamond lattice @xcite .",
    "the analysis of smit in the hcl has also been done by ipt .",
    "the respective smit in hcl has been shown to be of second order but at higher @xmath70 . as mentioned above ipt",
    "is known to overestimate the value of @xmath1 as compared with the other dmft methods .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recently tran and kuroki @xcite predicted both the first and second order phase transition points , and their coexistence in mit .",
    "we studied 2d hubbard model on honeycomb lattice and analyzed effects of short range interaction on renormalization of fermi velocity and phase transition by dmft .",
    "we used exact diagonalization method for solving 2d hubbard model and calculated double occupancy and renormalized fermi velocity .",
    "the phase transition point was accordingly obtained . using two different schemes we predicted the same critical on - site interaction @xmath66 .",
    "the phase transition was found to be of the second order with a critical @xmath13 lower than that given in ref . @xcite but close to that given in ref .",
