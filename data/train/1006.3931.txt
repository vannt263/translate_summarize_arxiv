    "hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition from hadronic matter into a partonic matter at high temperatures or densities . to predict the equation of state ,",
    "study the existence of possible critical point(s ) in the @xmath1 phase diagram and the properties of the phase transitions presents a theoretical challenge on studies based on the fundamental theory of strong interactions , qcd . to obtain some insight into the qcd dynamics of quarks in the nonperturbative domains , models like the nambu ",
    "jona  lasinio ( njl ) model have been developed .",
    "these models are based on the chiral symmetry of light quarks .    based on generic effective theory methods , identification of relevant degrees of freedom and symmetries , effective models able to account for the two most important features of qcd , deconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "have been developed and studied @xcite .",
    "these models include both chiral fields and the polyakov loop as relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the chiral symmetry is effectively represented by a njl model or linear sigma model ( lsm ) , while the @xmath2 symmetry relevant for deconfinement in pure gauge theory is described by a mean field potential for polyakov loop . the key role is played by the interactions coupling these two sectors . in the limit of light quarks the dynamics are driven by the chiral degrees of freedom and the decrease in the chiral condensate as the temperature is increased results in increase of the polyakov loop which in turn results in deconfinement and explains the intertwining of these two seemingly unrelated features to a single phase transition @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the current quark masses are taken large , chiral symmetry broken explicitly , the dynamics is close to that of pure gauge theory , i.e. dominated by the polyakov loop .",
    "nevertheless , at deconfimenent the interactions now lead to decrease in the chiral condensate and the two transitions again coincide . in real qcd approximate chiral symmetry",
    "is typically expected to play the dominant role .    in an earlier work",
    "we have compared the models of two - flavor qcd where the chiral sector is represented either with lsm or njl model @xcite at finite temperature and density .",
    "we found that while at zero chemical potential both cases give practically coincident results , the relative uncertainties increase when finite quark densities are considered .",
    "in particular the predictions for the location of the possible critical point in the @xmath1plane differ widely @xcite . as a further direction to study and constrain these models we considered the dependence on explicit chiral symmetry breaking , i.e. the value of the quark mass @xmath0 , in these models @xcite . in this brief report",
    "we complete this previous study by extending the analysis to finite density .",
    "we briefly comment also on the possible emergence of a quarkyonic phase introduced in recent literature @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ models ] we briefly recall the basic definitions of the two models we consider and explain the model parameters which allow for arbitrary pion mass . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our main results and in section [ checkout ] our conclusions and outlook .",
    "as explained in the introduction , in this work we continue our study @xcite of the quark ( or pion ) mass dependence of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "we consider the pnjl and plsm models which consist of a chiral part , a lattice fitted polyakov potential and a simple interaction between the two .",
    "the study of these models is done in the mean field approximation . for a detailed description of the derivation see @xcite , here we will simply state the resulting grand potential @xmath4",
    "the two models differ only in the chiral part which corresponds either to the njl or lsm models .",
    "the linear sigma model ( lsm ) consist of the sigma meson and the pions with their mutual interactions , and interactions with quarks .",
    "the njl model on the other hand describes only quarks with an effective four - fermion interaction . in both models ,",
    "the explicit chiral symmetry breaking is taken into account .",
    "the deconfining phase transition is included in both models through the mean field potential @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the constants @xmath7,@xmath8 are fixed to reproduce pure gauge theory thermodynamics with phase transition at @xmath9 mev ; we adopt the values determined in @xcite , and shown for completeness in table [ parametertable ] . here",
    "@xmath10 is the gauge invariant polyakov loop in the fundamental representation . instead of the polynomial form for the polyakov loop potential ( [ polyakov_potential ] ) ,",
    "also other possibilities exist .",
    "an example is the one introduced in @xcite which has the advantage that @xmath10 is always confined to the values between zero and one .",
    "however as discussed in @xcite these two possible forms for the potential do not differ significantly at temperatures below 300 mev , the region we are interested in .",
    "further improvement to the potential would be the inclusion of @xmath11dependence in the @xmath12 parameter as is done for example in @xcite and @xcite ; we will discuss this briefly in sec .",

    "the thermodynamics of the models are determined by solving the equations of motion for the order parameters , @xmath40 and then the pressure is given by evaluating the potential on the minimum , @xmath41 .",
    "we have chosen the constituent mass @xmath23 as a basic variable since this most conveniently allows us to discuss both models simultaneously .",
    "it is also straightforward to write the results in terms of the condensates @xmath42 and @xmath43 since these are linearly related to @xmath23 in each case . at finite chemical potential",
    "the mean field potential @xmath44 is complex due to the polyakov loops and minimizing such a potential is meaningless .",
    "a simple way to overcome this problem is to treat the polyakov loop parameters @xmath10 and @xmath45 as independent real variables , which will be a sufficient approximation for our current analysis .",
    "inaccuracies of this treatment as well as improved methods have been discussed for example in @xcite .",
    ".the parameters used for the effective potential [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ mqmpitable ]",
    "by construction , in these models there are a priori two transitions : the chiral transition due to the ( approximate ) restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement transition encoded into the polyakov potential .",
    "the transitions can be studied through their respective order parameters , the constituent quark mass @xmath23 and the thermal average of the polyakov field , @xmath10 .",
    "to both transitions one can assign their own critical temperatures .",
    "the definition of the critical temperature , however , is vague especially in the regions where the transition is a crossover and the order parameter shifts continuously .",
    "since this is the case over large portion of the @xmath1plane , in this work we primarily define the transition temperature as the temperature at which the temperature derivative of the order parameter has a maximum .",
    "even this definition has some problems , since in some cases the derivative has several local maxima indicating rapid changes at several different temperatures .",
    "the critical temperature is identified with the maximum at which the change in the absolute value of the corresponding order parameter is largest .",
    "alternatively one could use the susceptibilities to define the critical temperature .",
    "the chiral transition can be determined by finding the temperature corresponding to the fastest change in the constituent quark mass @xmath23 at fixed chemical potential @xmath11 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "this transition temperature corresponds in most cases to the temperature at which the constituent mass drops below @xmath46 of its vacuum value , only at large @xmath0 and @xmath11 does the fastest change occur at a different temperature than the one where the decrease in the absolute value of the constituent mass takes place .",
    "figure [ cmpdg ] shows the chiral transition lines in the @xmath1plane for different quark masses for both models ; also the critical points are shown .",
    "the critical points indicate the points where a line of first order ( discontinuous ) transitions ends and turns into a crossover ( continuous ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ cmpdg ] the qualitative features of the phase diagrams in the two models are very similar : as the quark mass rises , the area under the transition line expands and the critical point moves towards larger @xmath11 .",
    "the quantitative difference in the transition temperature between the models is below @xmath47 for the shown quark masses .",
    "however the critical points appear to be located quite differently in the models as we already noted for the physical value of @xmath0 in @xcite . in the plsm",
    "the transition for the lowest quark masses shown in figure [ cmpdg ] is first order all the way so there is no critical point in the @xmath1plane , the same holds for the largest quark mass but now the transition is a crossover throughout the plane .",
    "therefore , in the plsm model the critical point is present only at a finite @xmath0 interval and outside this interval the transition is either entirely crossover or entirely of first order . in @xcite",
    "a qualitatively similar result has been obtained for a three flavor linear sigma model .",
    "the fact that the transition in plsm is of first order over the entire @xmath1plane in chiral limit is due to neglect of the fermion vacuum energy @xcite .    in the pnjl case , where the fermion vacuum contribution is included ,",
    "the critical points persist even for the smallest quark masses shown and the transitions at zero chemical potential remain crossovers . also the critical temperature at the critical point starts to rise again at larger quark masses and does not disappear as in the plsm case .",
    "a similar effect has been observed in @xcite , where a saturation of the critical point temperature was mentioned and attributed to a diquark dominated phase . since our work",
    "does not include diquark degrees of freedom , we conclude that the behaviour of the critical point at large quark masses is a more generic feature of the pnjl model .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that there might be , especially at small quark masses , multiple critical points in the @xmath1plane . we , however , found no evidence in either model to suggest that this is the case . in our previous work @xcite we noted that at large quark masses the plsm transition was first order at @xmath48 giving some credence to the idea of multiple critical points at large quark masses .",
    "as mentioned in the previous paragraph and evident from figure [ cmpdg ] , this is not the case in our present work and the first order transition at @xmath48 observed in @xcite was caused by the overestimation of the nucleon mass @xmath49 at large pion masses and the resulting overestimation of the coupling @xmath28 .",
    "now , with the more precise formula ( [ nuc_mass_par ] ) for the nucleon mass , the transition is a crossover for all quark masses above the physical mass @xmath50 mev .    -1.2truecm",
    "-0.4truecm      the deconfinement of the system is quantified by the polyakov loop order parameter @xmath10 and its conjugate @xmath45 , which we treat as independent real variables . as with the chiral transition the transition temperatures could be determined locating the maxima of the temperature derivatives .",
    "however , as noted in our previous works @xcite , there is in some cases a double peak structure in the derivatives with one peak coinciding with the chiral transition and caused by the interaction between the chiral and polyakov sectors of the models .",
    "the second peak is a softer one and is related to the the transition present in the parametrization of the polyakov loop mean field potential .",
    "generally , the softer peaks occur at the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 , so they could be considered as measures of the system becoming deconfined .",
    "this is a reasonable statement since confinement in the models is due to numerical suppression of quarks states through the order parameters @xmath10 and @xmath45 .",
    "this means that alternatively the deconfinement could be considered to occur when the suppressing order parameters reach large enough value in order not to provide suppression anymore . since the polyakov loop order parameters @xmath10 and @xmath45 obtain , with our choice of potential , values roughly from 0 to 1 , the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 are a natural choice to be the indicator of when the system turns from a mostly confined state to a mostly deconfined state , bearing in mind that the transition is a crossover . to further simplify the analysis and readability of the figures we will ,",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath45 do not coincide at finite @xmath11 , define single deconfinement transition temperature as the average of the transition temperatures determined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in figures",
    "[ qndg ] and [ qndg50 ] the averaged deconfinement transition lines are shown for the physical quark mass @xmath55 mev and a larger quark mass @xmath56 mev along with the corresponding chiral transitions .",
    "the first observation is that , defined this way , the deconfinement transition is independent of the chiral model and also of the amount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking i.e. the quark mass .",
    "this means that tuning the polyakov potential , so that one obtains a coincidence of the deconfining and chiral transitions for one chiral model and a specific quark mass , will not give the same outcome in other cases .",
    "furthermore , the deconfinement transition line , @xmath57 , depends only very weakly on @xmath11 .",
    "this means that deconfinement and chiral restoration can be made to coincide only at @xmath58 .",
    "however , on the basis of symmetries one does not expect deconfinement and chiral restoration to become independent at finite @xmath11 .",
    "hence one is led to study possible @xmath11-dependence in the polyakov loop potential .    -1.2truecm -0.4truecm",
    "-1.2truecm -0.4truecm    to illustrate the effects of @xmath11dependence of the polyakov potential on the deconfinement transition , we adopt the formulation from @xcite with the following modifications : in @xcite the @xmath11dependence of the polyakov potential was through the critical temperature @xmath12 , which could be described by the following parametrization @xmath59 with the coefficient @xmath60 depending on the number of colors , massless flavors and the chemical potential , @xmath61 the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 gev were fixed to reproduce the @xmath64 lattice result @xmath65 mev .",
    "for two massless flavors this would mean @xmath66 mev .",
    "however , since we want to make a comparison between the the @xmath11dependent and the @xmath11independent cases , we keep the @xmath48 point as a reference point for the two cases .",
    "hence we use @xmath67 this modification does not alter the fixing of the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which we fix to their above mentioned values .",
    "our parametrization implies @xmath65 mev for any number of flavors .",
    "however , we are not interested in @xmath70-dependence since will exclusively consider the case @xmath71 and we want to only use the @xmath11-dependent polyakov loop potential to illustrate the uncertainties which may arise in our consideration of @xmath1 phase diagrams .",
    "the @xmath70-dependence in ( [ our_b ] ) also neglects the effect of quark masses , which will suppresses @xmath12 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this effect is not large for two light flavors , but grows more significant when considering larger quark masses .",
    "we stress that our intention here is simply to illustrate the effect of @xmath11-dependent polyakov potential on the phase diagram and for that purpose the simple parametrization we have chosen is sufficient .",
    "the phase diagrams obtained using the @xmath11dependent polyakov potential are shown in figures [ qndgmd ] and [ qndg50md ] .",
    "the deconfinement transition now appears very different : the main new feature is that the deconfinement temperature follows the chiral restoration critical temperature more closely .",
    "of course one may argue that this feature is put in by hand into the models of this type , but one the other hand the deconfinement phase transition is put in by hand already into the @xmath58 polyakov potential .",
    "lattice determination of the coincidence of the chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement at finite @xmath11 would provide strong motivation to use @xmath11-dependent polyakov potential in these effective modes .",
    "however , on the basis of the symmetries of the underlying gauge dynamics , one would indeed expect deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration to coincide also at finite @xmath11 .    -1.2truecm",
    "-0.4truecm    -1.2truecm -0.4truecm    as a final application we will discuss the possibility of describing the quarkonic phase with these models .",
    "recently there has been some interest towards a novel form of matter conjectured to exist in the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "to briefly recall , the conjecture is based on considerations at t hooft large @xmath72 limit and rests mainly on the following two features : first , since the free energy scales with the number of degrees of freedom , one has hierarchical contributions from the quarks and gluons , of the order of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "second , while the mesons and glueballs become free in the large @xmath72 limit , their cubic and quartic interactions vanishing as @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , the baryons remain strongly coupled .",
    "both these features are , however , valid in the large @xmath72 limit while for qcd @xmath76 . furthermore , as we will now briefly discuss , the large @xmath72 limit is not unique @xcite .    in the t hooft limit of large @xmath72 the fermions",
    "are taken to transform according to the fundamental representation .",
    "this leads to the well known features at large @xmath72 : planar diagrams dominate , and among these diagrams quark loops are suppressed relative to gluonic ones . as the dimension of fermion representation is @xmath72 while the one for gluons is @xmath77 , different orders of magnitude for the free energies emerge as @xmath72 is taken large .",
    "however , consider the following redefinition of the quark fields @xmath78 i.e. consider quarks to transform in the two index anti - symmetric representation , which for su(3 ) conceptually corresponds to renaming antiquarks as quarks . while this changes nothing in the dynamics for @xmath76 ,",
    "the large @xmath72 limit is entirely different .",
    "this is due to the fact that quarks in the anti - symmetric representation are counted similarly to gluons and hence they do not decouple at large @xmath72 .",
    "the free energies of quarks and gluons are both of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "the different behavior between mesons and baryons is similar to t hooft limit .",
    "these different large @xmath72 limits emphasize different phenomenological features , and t is difficult to argue that either would be more realistic ; more probably both are somewhat idealized and equally far from real three color qcd . and these two do not even exhaust the possible large @xmath72 limits .",
    "for example , one can also consider the possibility of having a hybrid large @xmath72 limit where out of three flavors one quark flavor transforms in the two - index antisymmetric representation while the other two are taken to transform in the fundamental representation . in this case",
    "it is possible to construct color singlet states consisting of three quarks at any @xmath72 .",
    "these baryons are very different in comparison to baryons of the other two large @xmath72 limits considered above : their masses do not grow with @xmath72 and their regge slopes coincide with the regge slopes of mesons .",
    "we do not embark on a thorough analysis of the phenomenology associated with these large @xmath72 limits ; see e.g. @xcite . from the above discussion",
    "we simply remark that the extrapolations from large @xmath72 limits to real three color qcd should be taken with a grain of salt . a lattice study considering the quarkyonic phase in two - color qcd",
    "has recently appeared @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that that the quarkyonic phase can be characterized by a non - vanishing baryon density while the system is still in a confined phase @xcite . in our models",
    "we have access to the quark number density @xmath79 which we can use as a measure of the baryon density .",
    "if we first consider the case of a @xmath11independent polyakov potential , illustrated in figures [ qndg ] and [ qndg50 ] , there is a sharp rise in the quark number density simultaneously with the chiral transition . as with the deconfinement transition ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of this rise is not great , it is around 0.6 @xmath80 , but the relative increase is about a factor of four .",
    "so it could be argued that at the point of the chiral transition also the number density changes from a nearly zero value to a non - zero one .",
    "another way of characterizing this quarkyonic transition is to assign a threshold value for @xmath81 which separates the phases .",
    "this , however , is more arbitrary since the threshold value of @xmath81 one could choose is not in any way unique . in figures [ qndg ] and [ qndg50 ]",
    "we have plotted the chiral transition line , which corresponds to the rise in quark number density , along with the deconfinement transition line , obtained as explained in the previous section , and two curves which correspond to values of 1 and 2 @xmath80 of @xmath81 .",
    "if one naively expects a baryon to have quark density around 3 @xmath80 then one should have nonzero net baryon density not later than when the average quark density hits 3 @xmath80 , most likely even sooner .",
    "seeing also that the deconfinement line lies at large temperatures , there is a substantial window for the quarkyonic matter to exist realizing the picture envisioned in @xcite .",
    "however , this picture changes considerably if the polyakov loop potential depends explicitly on @xmath11 .",
    "this case is shown in figures [ qndgmd ] and [ qndg50md ] .",
    "first of all the quantitative behaviour of the quark number density changes quite drastically : now @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath80 lines are well inside the chirally broken phase , but also the rise in quark number density associated with the chiral transition becomes significantly larger , in particular at large @xmath11 .",
    "but more importantly , the change in the deconfining transition , which now follows the chiral transition more closely , significantly decreases the area where possible quarkyonic matter could reside . here",
    "one should remember that when implementing the @xmath11dependence to the polyakov potential , we neglected effects from number of flavors and quark masses , which would bring the deconfinement lines down even faster than in figures [ qndgmd ] and [ qndg50md ] and thus practically closing the window for the existence of quarkyonic matter .",
    "we have considered the @xmath1 phase diagram of two - flavor qcd in effective models which take into account both chiral degrees of freedom relevant for the restoration of the chiral symmetry and polyakov loop relevant for deconfienement .",
    "earlier these studies have been performed by constraining these models to reproduce the physical vacuum , in the two flavor case essentially determined by the bare quark mass @xmath84 ( or alternatively by the pion mass @xmath85 ) .",
    "we have relaxed this assumption and treated @xmath0 as a free parameter of the model in order to study how the explicit chiral breaking manifests in the thermodynamics .",
    "we considered , side by side , two different models pnjl and plsm which differ by the choice of the effective realization for the chiral sector . in earlier studies",
    "these two models have been shown to lead to qualitatively similar results for the thermodynamics both at finite temperature and density ; the main quantitative difference has been shown to be in the location of the critical point in the @xmath1 phase diagram . in this paper",
    "we have shown that , as a function of @xmath0 , a qualitative difference arises : while in pnjl model the critical point exists for any @xmath0 , in plsm model the critical point exists only for a range of values of @xmath0 . in both models",
    "we find , for any @xmath0 , at most one critical point in contrast to the results in @xcite where multiple critical points were observed for lsm model at non - physical values of the pion mass .    finally , we applied these effective models to consider the quarkyonic phase in two flavor qcd .",
    "the theoretical motivations on the existence of this novel phase are based on large @xmath72-limit of qcd and sensitive to _ which _ large @xmath72 limit is considered model studies are required .",
    "furthermore , the existence of this novel state of matter was shown to depend sensitively on the parametrization of the polyakov loop potential at finite @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath11independent polyakov loop potential there appears a wide window in the @xmath1 phase diagram for quarkyonic matter to exist while if @xmath11 dependence in the polyakov loop is introduced to obtain coincidence of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement similarly as at @xmath58 , the window for quarkyonic matter practically closes .",
