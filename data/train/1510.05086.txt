    "an appropriate analysis of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) can provide an efficient tool to study their population of binaries stars ( e.g.romani & weinberg 1991 ; bolte 1992 ; rubenstein & baylin 1997 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2002 ; clark sandquist & bolte 2004 ; richer et al . 2004 ; zhao & baylin 2005 ; milone et al 2009 ; ji & bregman2013 , 2015 ) .    such an approach can provide statistically robust results , because it allows the study of thousands of stars from a single cmd , and is sensitive to binary systems with any inclination and orbital period .",
    "an accurate study of binaries requires high - precision photometry of stars in the crowded field of a gc , correction of differential reddening , and accurate analysis of photometric errors and field - stars contamination . while previous studies included a small number of gcs , in the last years , accurate photometry from high - resolution _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images allowed the systematic investigations of large sample of clusters ( sollima et al.2007 ; milone et al.2012 , hereafter mpb+12 ) .",
    "mpb+12 investigated main - sequence ( ms ) binaries from homogeneous photometry of 59 galactic gcs observed with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( wfc / acs ) of _ hst _ as part of the globular cluster treasury project ( go10775 , pi.a.sarajedini , see sarajedini et al .",
    "the authors estimated the fraction of binaries , determined the mass - ratio and the radial distribution , and investigated relations between the fraction of binaries and the main parameters of the host gcs .",
    "most gcs contain a fraction of binaries smaller than the fraction of binaries in the galactic field .",
    "binaries are more centrally concentrated than single stars , with the fraction of binaries generally dropping down by a factor of two from the center to about two core - radii .",
    "there is a significant anticorrelation between the fraction of binaries and the cluster mass .",
    "all the gcs studied by sollima et al.(2007 ) and mpb+12 and included in the globular cluster treasury project have galactocentric distances smaller than @xmath121kpc .",
    "the population of binaries in outer - halo gcs is almost unexplored .",
    "archive data taken with wfc / acs and with the ultraviolet and visual channel of the wide field camera 3 ( uvis / wfc3 ) are available for eight outer - halo gcs , namely pyxis , ruprecht106 , ic4499 , ngc6426 , ngc7006 , palomar15 , am4 , and palomar13 .",
    "these images have been collected through the same f606w and f814w filters as used in go10775.=@xmath21.3 , harris1996 , 2010 , age=13gyr ) show that the maximum difference between the luminosity of ms stars brighter than @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnitude of the main - sequence turn off , is @xmath50.018 and @xmath60.011 mag .",
    "the maximum color difference is @xmath7 .",
    "when we use isochrones with the metallicity as pal13 ( [ fe / h]=-1.88 , harris1996 , 2010 ) we obtain identical results : @xmath50.016 , @xmath60.010 mag , and @xmath8",
    ". such small differences are negligible for our purposes . ]    in this paper , we exploit this dataset to extend the study of binaries along the ms by mpb+12 to outer - halo gcs .",
    "to determine the fraction of binaries in am4 and pal13 we have used photometry and astrometry from images collected with the uvis / wfc3 on board of _ hst _",
    "( go11680 , pi : g.h.smith , see hamren et al.2013 ) .",
    "this dataset consists of 4@xmath9615s in f606w and 4@xmath9620s in f814w for am4 and 4@xmath9610s in f606w and 4@xmath9615s in f814w for pal13 . for the other six outer - halo gcs",
    "we have used the photometric catalogs from dotter et al.(2011 ) obtained by using acs / wfc images from go11586 ( pi : a.dotter , see dotter et al.2011 ) .",
    "uvis / wfc3 images have been corrected for the effect of poor charge transfer efficiency following anderson & bedin(2010 ) and by using the software written and provided by these authors .",
    "briefly , they have developed a model that reproduces the trails observed in a large sample of analysed dark exposures .",
    "their software converts the observed into an estimate of the original pixel values by inverting the derived model .",
    "the software that we have adopted to obtain photometry and astrometry of stars in uvis / wfc3 images has been provided to us by jay anderson , is based on the recipe by anderson et al.(2008 ) and has been adapted to uvis / wfc3 by jay anderson .",
    "we fitted to each star in each exposure a grid of psfs interpolated specifically for that star , from a 9@xmath95 psf grid in each chip of the uvis / wfc3 .",
    "this grid model consists of a library psf by anderson et al.(in preparation ) plus a spatially - constant perturbation for each exposure which accounts for any focus variation due to the ` breathing ' of _ hst_. the psf fitting of each isolated star uses the central 5@xmath95 pixel and is performed after subtracting off its neighbours as explained in anderson & king(2006 ) . in the case of stars with significant contamination from close neighbours we performed the psf fitting on the centermost pixels .",
    "the sky level is measured from an annulus with radii 4 and 8 pixels for the brighter stars and 3 and 7 pixels for the fainter stars .",
    "as described in detail by anderson et al.(2008 ) , we have inferred positions and luminosities of bright and faint stars by using two different methods .",
    "bright stars have been measured independently in each image and results combined later , while astrometry and photometry of each very faint star has been determined by simultaneously fitting all the pixels in all the exposures .",
    "stellar positions have been corrected for geometrical distortion using the solution by bellini , anderson & bedin(2011 ) , and photometry has been calibrated to the vega - mag system as in bedin et al.(2005 ) by using the zero points provided by the stsci web page for wfc3/uvis .",
    "we exploit three indexes provided by the adopted software and described in detail by anderson et al.(2008 ) as diagnostics of photometric quality : the fraction of flux in the stellar aperture from its neighbours ( @xmath10 ) , the fractional residuals in the fit of the psf to the pixel ( @xmath11 ) , and the rms of the independent measurements of the average position in the f606w and f814w images .",
    "we limited our study to relatively - isolated stars with small astrometric uncertainties and well fitted by the psf , in close analogy to mpb+12 .",
    "these stars have been selected as in mpb+12 ( see their sect .",
    "2.1 ) , by rejecting any source that , in comparison to stars with similar luminosity , exhibit anomalously large values of the @xmath11 or @xmath10 parameters , or large values of the position rms .",
    "finally , the cmds have been corrected for differential reddening and for spatial variation of the photometric zero point due to small psf inaccuracies by using the method described in mpb+12 ( see their sect .  3 ) .",
    "briefly , we have first rotated the cmd of each cluster in a way that the new abscissa is parallel to the reddening vector . then , we have derived a fiducial line of the ms and the sgb of each cluster , by putting a spline through the median value of the quantities in the abscissa ( pseudo - color ) and the ordinata ( pseudo - magnitude ) in the rotated reference frame derived in successive short bins of pseudo - magnitude , and we iterated this step with a sigma clipping ; we have then derived for each star the pseudo - color residuals of a sample of 50 relatively - bright and well - measured ms and sgb stars with respect to the fiducial line . to do this",
    "we have excluded the target star from the calculation of its own differential reddening .",
    "we assumed as differential reddening of each star , the median value of such residuals measured along the reddening line .",
    "as discussed in mpb+12 and in the next subsection , artificial stars ( ass ) are crucial to determine the fraction of binaries in any gc .",
    "as - tests have been performed as in anderson et al.(2008 ) .",
    "briefly , we have first generated a list including the position in the reference frame and the magnitudes of 500,000 stars .",
    "ass have been placed along the ms fiducial line in the cmd of each cluster with a flat luminosity function in the f814w band covering the magnitude range from the saturation level down to an instrumental f814w magnitude2.5 log@xmath12(flux@xmath13 ) ] of @xmath24.5 .",
    "the projected distribution of stars is flat within the cluster core and declines as @xmath14 outside the core .",
    "the software described by anderson et al.(2008 ) generates for each star in the input list and for each image , a star with the appropriate coordinates and flux .",
    "then it measures its magnitude and position by using the same procedure as for real stars and provides the same diagnostics of the photometric quality as for real stars .",
    "we considered an as as recovered when the measured luminosity in each band differs from the input value by not more than 0.75 mag , and the position by less than 0.5 pix in each coordinate .",
    "we used for ass the same procedure described above for real stars to select a sub - sample of relatively - isolated stars with small astrometric errors , and well fitted by the psf .",
    "ass have been first used to derive the completeness level of our sample by following the recipe in mpb+12 ( see their sect .  2.2 for details ) .",
    "briefly , we have determined a @xmath15 grid in the magnitude - radius plane .",
    "specifically we have subdivided the field of view into five circular regions and within each of them , we have analysed as results in 8 magnitude bins over the interval from @xmath16 .",
    "we have determined , for each grid point , the completeness as the fraction of recovered to added stars and interpolated these grid points to estimate the completeness value associated to each star .",
    "moreover , a subsample of 100,000 ass have been used to estimate the fraction of chance - superposition binaries as we will descrive in the next section .      in this section",
    "we describe the method adopted to determine the fraction of binaries with mass ratio , q@xmath170.5 .",
    "indeed , binaries with smaller mass ratios are very close to the ms fiducial line and , due to photometric errors , are indistinguishable from single ms stars .    to determine the fraction of binaries with mass ratio q@xmath170.5 we used the method described by mpb+12 , that we summarise here for convenience .",
    "briefly , we determined the magnitude of the ms turnoff ( to ) in the f814w band ( @xmath4 ) and defined two regions in the cmd : a region `` a '' populated by single stars and those binary systems with a primary component with @xmath18 ( the shadowed area in each panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) , and a region `` b '' which is the portion of a containing the binaries with q@xmath170.5 ( the darker area in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the reddest line is the locus of the equal - mass binaries shifted to the red by 4-@xmath19 ( where @xmath19 is the error estimated as in mpb+12 ) .",
    "the dashed line is the ms fiducial moved by 4 @xmath19 to the blue .",
    "the locus of the cmd of binaries with a given mass ratio has been determined by using the mass - luminosity relation provided by the best - fitting isochrones from dotter et al.(2008 ) .",
    "the fraction of binaries with q@xmath170.5 is calculated as in eq .  1 in mpb+12 : @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the number of cluster stars ( corrected for completeness ) observed in region a ( b ) of the cmd ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding numbers of artificial stars , and field stars normalised to the area of the cluster field .    in order to derive the cmd of artificial stars used to estimate @xmath22 we have used ass .",
    "specifically , we have selected for each observed star a set of ass from the catalog derived in sect .",
    "[ subsec : ass ] with a measured f814w magnitude within 0.2 mag and a radial distance within 200 pixels for a total 100,000 ass .",
    "this procedure ensures that the sample of artificial stars used to infer the fraction of chance - superposition binaries , that is the ratio @xmath24 , has almost the same spatial and luminosity distribution as the observed ones .",
    "the cmd derived from ass is shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] for rup106 where for clearness , we have selected a subsample of stars that is equal in number to the number of real stars plotted in the right panel of the same figure . to estimate the number of field stars we used a synthetic @xmath25 versus @xmath26 cmd containing the same number of field stars expected in the field of view of each gc .",
    "to do this , we used the program trilegal 1.6 which predicts star counts , and colours and magnitudes for stars in any galactic field on the basis of the galactic model by girardi et al.(2005 ) .",
    "we repeated the same procedure for the fraction of binaries with q@xmath170.6 and q@xmath170.7 .",
    "as done in mpb+12 , we have analysed annuli with different radial distances from the cluster center .",
    "when we study the binaries in a given annulus , the ass used to derive the fraction of binaries as in eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] have been extracted from the same annulus in such a way that the photometric and astrometric measurements of both real and artificial stars are similarly affected by crowding .",
    "we have measured both the total fraction of binaries and the fraction of binaries with q@xmath170.5 in the core ( @xmath27 sample ) , in the region between the core and the half - mass radius ( @xmath28 sample ) , and outside the half - mass radius ( @xmath29 sample ) .",
    "the values for the core radii are from the harris(1996 , updated as in 2010 ) catalog while the values for the half - mass radii are from the 2003 edition .",
    "the clusters centers have been determined by ryan goldsbury ( private communication ) as in goldsbury et al.(2010 ) and will be published in a separate paper . in the case of ngc7006 , which is the most - massive cluster of our sample",
    ", we have excluded from the analysis stars within a minimum cluster radius ( @xmath30=0.8 arcmin ) where crowding prevents us from distinguishing binaries with q@xmath31 .        in principle , the total fraction of binaries , @xmath32 can be inferred from the fraction of binaries by adopting a mass - ratio distribution ( sollima et al.2007 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will follow the approach by sollima and collaborators and estimate @xmath32 by extrapolating the values obtained for @xmath33 .",
    "mpb+12 compared the binary fraction determined for 59 gcs in small intervals of mass ratio and concluded that the analysed gcs have , on average a flat mass - ratio distribution for q@xmath170.5 .",
    "unfortunately , the mass - ratio distribution of binaries in gcs is poorly constrained for q@xmath340.5 . in this paper",
    "we will extrapolate the result by mpb+12 to lower mass ratio and assume that the total fraction of binaries is two times the fraction of binaries with q@xmath170.5 . for completeness",
    ", we recall the conclusion by mpb+12 that , if we assume a fisher et al.(2005 ) mass - ratio distribution the total binary fraction is @xmath35 , while if we assume that binary pairs formed by random association of stars with different masses according to a kroupa(2002 ) initial mass function , we obtain @xmath36 .      in sect .",
    "[ sec : relations ] we will correlate the binary fraction with a number of physical and morphological parameters of the host gcs . for that purpose we extracted the following parameters from the 2010 edition of the harris(1996 ) catalog : absolute magnitude ( @xmath37 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath38 ) , king(1962)-model central concentration ( @xmath39 ) , central velocity dispersion ( @xmath40 ) , logarithm of central stellar density ( @xmath41 ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , core relaxation half time ( @xmath42 ) , and half - mass relaxation half time ( @xmath43 ) , central surface brightness ( @xmath44 ) , distance from the galactic center ( @xmath45 ) , specific frequency of rrlyrae ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we used two sets of values for cluster ages .",
    "these include ages determined by the group of vandenberg and collaborators ( vandenberg et al.2013 and leaman et al.2013 ) and ages based on dartmouth isochrones , estimated by dotter et al.(2010 , 2011 ) and hamren et al.(2013 ) . in the case of am4 we derived an age of 13.0@xmath471.5 gyr by adopting the same method and the same isochrones used by dotter et al.(2010 ) and assuming the same values of metallicity , reddening , and distance modulus as in hamren et al.(2013 ) .",
    "in addition , we have used the values of the r - parameter ( @xmath48 ) provided by salaris et al.(2004 ) , which are sensitive to the helium content of gcs .    to study the relation between binaries and the horizontal branch ( hb ) , we have used several quantities as indicator of the hb morphology . the hb - ratio , ( hbr ) , from the 2003 version of the harris1996 catalog , the @xmath26 color distance from the rgb and the reddest part of the hb ( @xmath49 ) , and the @xmath26 color extension of the hb ( @xmath50 ) from milone et al.(2014 ) .",

    "specifically , we have used three luminosity bin including all the single stars and the binaries with a primary star [ 0.75,1.75 ] , [ 1.75,2.75 ] and [ 2.75,3.75 ] f814w magnitude fainter than the msto , respectively .",

    "[ fig : md ] we have divided @xmath91 by the fraction of binaries with q@xmath170.5 in the entire field and plotted @xmath91 against the average mass of the primary - component stars of the binaries in each magnitude interval .",
    "stellar masses have been derived by using the mass - luminosity relation provided by the adopted isochrones from dotter et al.(2008 ) .",
    "gray points and red triangles indicate results from this paper and from mpb+12 .",
    "the gray line is the best - fitting straight line , whose slope , indicated in the inset support the conclusion by mpb+12 that the binary fraction does not depend on the mass of the primary component .",

    "results are provided in table  [ tab : risultati ] where we indicate for each parameter the spearman s rank correlation coefficient , @xmath93 .",
    "we used bootstrapping statistics to estimate uncertainties in @xmath93 . to do this we generated 1,000 resamples of the observed dataset , of equal size , and for each resample ( i ) , ( which is generated by random sampling with replacement from the original dataset ) we estimated r@xmath79 .",
    "we considered the dispersion of the r@xmath79 measurements ( @xmath94 ) as indicative of robustness of r and list the number of included gcs ( @xmath87 ) . since the definition of core radius is not reliable for post - core - collapse ( pcc ) clusters ( trager et al.1995 ) we have excluded these gcs from the calculation of @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fmv ] shows a significant correlation between the fraction of binaries and the absolute magnitude of the host gc , which is present in each @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath29 sample .",
    "this relation is clearly visible from the clusters studied by mpb+12 ( gray dots ) and the eight gcs studied in this paper ( red triangles ) follow a similar trend in the @xmath97 vs.@xmath37 plane .",
    "in particular the two gcs with very - low luminosities , namely am4 and pal13 host a large fraction of binaries with mass ratio larger than 0.5 ( @xmath980.2 ) .",
    "noticeable , the presence of a large binary fraction in pal13 confirms previous findings by clark sandquist & bolte2004 who analysed photometry from keckii telescope of this cluster and concluded that pal13 host more than 30@xmath474% of binaries .",
    "in contrast , pcc clusters , which are represented with black crosses , seem to exhibit a flat distribution in the middle and left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fmv ] .",
    "however , we admit that this conclusion is currently based only on a small number of pcc gcs ( nine in total ) and a small interval of absolute luminosity . moreover , there is a significant scatter for clusters with the the same absolute luminosity , which suggest that apart from the gc luminosity ( a proxy for the gc mass ) at least one more parameter is needed to explain the content of binaries in gcs .",
    "the correlation between the binary fraction and the age of the host cluster has been widely debated in recent literature .",
    "ji & bregman(2015 ) have estimated the fraction of binaries in 35 galactic gcs from the same dataset by sarajedini et al.(2007 ) and anderson et al.(2008 ) previously analysed by mpb+12 . from the analysis of the binary fraction in the core of 24 gcs , they concluded that the fraction of binaries in the core decreases with the cluster age as previously suggested by sollima et al.(2007 ) on the basis of their analysis of 13 low - density gcs .",
    "these results are not in agreement with the conclusion by mpb+12 who did not find any significant correlation between the fraction of binaries and the cluster ages by marn - franch et al.(2009 ) and de angeli et al.(2005 ) .",
    "we have plotted , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ages ] , the fraction of binaries with q@xmath170.5 in the core as a function of the cluster ages derived by dotter et al.(2010 , 2011 left panel ) and by vandenberg et al.(2013 ) and leaman et al.(2013 , right panel ) .",
    "our results do not confirm the finding by ji & bregman , indeed , as quoted in each panel , the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is @xmath990.1 for ages by dotter et al.(2011 ) and @xmath990.4 when ages from vandenberg , leaman and collaborators are used .",
    "such difference , is in part due to the fact that the latter age compilation includes less clusters than those analysed by dotter et al.(2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "similarly , the disagreement between our conclusions and those by ji & bregman(2015 ) could be due to the fact that some old clusters like e3 , am4 or pal13 with large binary fractions are not included in the sample analysed by ji & bregman .",
    "although binaries have been considered as a candidate second - parameter to explain the hb morphology in gcs ( e.g.napiwotzki et al.2004 ; lei et al.2014 ) , mpb+12 did not find any significant relation between the fraction of binaries and the hb parameters that they have analysed .",
    "these include the hb morphology index ( hbr , from mackey & van den bergh 2005 ) , the median color difference between the hb and the rgb , @xmath78(v@xmath2i ) , from dotter et al.2010 ) , and the temperature of the hottest hb star ( @xmath100 , from recio - blanco et al.2006 ) .",
    "when we extend the analysis to the gcs studied in this paper , we confirm the lack of a significant correlation between the fraction of binaries and hbr . unfortunately , there are no estimates of @xmath100 and @xmath78(v@xmath2i ) available the eight clusters analysed in this work .",
    "in addition to what has been done in mpb+12 , we investigate the correlation between the binary fraction and the color distance between the reddest part of the hb and the rgb ( l@xmath101 ) and the color extension of the hb ( l@xmath102 , from milone et al.2014 ) .",
    "there is a very marginal @xmath97 vs.l@xmath101 anticorrelation ( r=@xmath20.41 ) and some hint of anticorrelation between @xmath97 and l@xmath102 ( r=@xmath20.58 ) , although this latter correlation is expected given that l@xmath103 correlates with the cluster absolute magnitude ( milone et al.2014 ) .",
    "finally , we note that there is no correlation between @xmath97 and the following parameters of the host cluster : [ fe / h ] , c , @xmath41 , log(@xmath104 ) , log(@xmath105 ) , e , r@xmath106 , r , s@xmath107 . the fraction of binaries anti - correlates with the central velocity dispersion , and there is a mild correlation with @xmath44 .",
