    "it is advantageous to go over to electron - hole correlators @xcite with the hole current defined via @xmath135 ( note that in ref .",
    "the electronic currents in the two normal leads originate from the low - rate emission of cooper pairs from the superconductor and hence are _ both small _ ; alternatively , one may view these excess currents as arising from andreev - scattering at the normal - superconductor interface where an incident electron is reflected as a hole ) . again , the electron - hole number correlators entering ( [ p ] ) are split into an irreducible and a reducible part , @xmath136 with the irreducible number correlator defined as @xmath137 next , we can make use of the fact that the irreducible current correlator @xmath138 rapidly decays on a time scale @xmath139 ( within a quantum mechanical framework , @xmath140 is the single particle correlation time ) . for @xmath141 , we can approximate the irreducible part of @xmath142 by the time - independent zero - frequency noise correlator @xmath143 ( cf .  ref . ) , @xmath144 inserting this expression into the correlators @xmath145 we arrive at the expression analogous to the one introduced in ref .",
    "@xmath146 in a final step , we demonstrate that we can ignore the current product term @xmath147 in the tunneling limit .",
    "in order to gain more insight , we analyze the situation theoretically within a quantum mechanical framework for non - interacting electrons : with @xmath148 and @xmath149 ( we assume that @xmath150 ; the vectors @xmath151 and @xmath152 denote the directions associated with the detectors @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) we find that @xmath153 .",

    "it is crucial to understand that under these circumstances the accumulation time @xmath127 appears as a _ theoretical _ quantity which is needed only in the derivation of the bell parameter ; once we have demonstrated that @xmath127 can be chosen such that the current product term is small , the latter can be dropped and @xmath127 _ disappears _ from the bell parameter .",
    "while the above idealized theoretical consideration serves as a guideline , the situation in a real experiment may be complicated due to interactions and other effects which change the value of the correlation time @xmath139 , i.e. , @xmath139 may differ substantially from @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , in an actual experiment testing the bell inequalities the decay time @xmath139 of the correlator should be measured independently in order to verify that the second term in ( [ cnnzfn ] ) involving the product of average currents is indeed small on this time scale and thus can be dropped .",
    "fortunately , in the tunneling limit the admissible time window @xmath158 is large and this test can be carried out with only an approximate knowledge of the correlation time @xmath139 .",
    "once we have verified that we can drop the correction term @xmath159 in ( [ cnnzfn ] ) we can express the coincidence probabilities through the ( time - independent ) zero - frequency noise correlators @xmath160 alone , @xmath161 the correlator @xmath162 then takes the simple form @xmath163 the results ( [ ps ] ) and ( [ bes ] ) now are independent of time , although the original expression ( [ p ] ) involved the time restriction @xmath164 ; their use is restricted to the tunneling limit as only in this case the correction term @xmath165 in the denominator of @xmath145 can be dropped .",
    "let us next concentrate on the general situation away from the tunneling limit which turns out quite different . in this case",
    ", there is no advantage in going over to hole currents and we work with electronic currents in both leads .",
    "second , in the absence of a small tunneling probability we have no separation of time scales and @xmath166 are of the same order , hence the accumulation time @xmath127 has to be smaller than ( or at most of the order of ) the single particle correlation time @xmath139 , @xmath167 . as a consequence , one _ can not _ express the coincidence probability @xmath168 through the zero - frequency noise correlator @xmath169 .",

    "this coincides with the time restriction imposed by our definition ( [ p ] ) of the coincidence probability in terms of number correlators  it turns out that the bell inequality can be violated during those times @xmath127 where the ( normalized ) number correlator assumes the meaning of a coincidence probability .",

    "the simplified version ( [ bes ] ) valid in the tunneling limit and first introduced ( via an alternative route ) in ref .   has been successfully applied in ref .  . however , its application in ref .   to a situation away from the tunneling regime led to the appearance of a ` spurious amplification factor ' in the relation between the bell parameter and the concurrence , a consequence of ignoring the presence of the current product term @xmath176 .",

    ", we have been careful to separate theoretical from experimental input in the construction of the bell parameter and have provided final expressions involving only experimental input . depending on the chosen variables and on the physical situation , we have seen that a short time measurement is required in general ; in the tunneling limit , an approximate determination of the correlation time @xmath139 together with the zero - frequency noise correlator is sufficient .",
    "it is interesting to compare our point of view expressed in the above derivation with the approach introduced in ref . , where the authors derive a bell parameter which does not involve a short time measurement .",
    "while this scheme works the same way as ours in the tunneling limit ( rough estimate of @xmath139 and knowledge of the zero - frequency noise are sufficient ) , it does require the additional _ precise _ knowledge of the correlation time @xmath139 away from the tunneling limit , which either requires an accurate theoretical evaluation for the device at hand or again necessitates a short time measurement .    in refs .",

    "in contrast to our definition ( [ p ] ) above , which has been based on physically measurable quantities and which involves a time restriction @xmath133 , the definition ( [ p_but ] ) is a time independent correlator but probably can not be measured in a mesoscopic setting .",
    "the idea put forward in ref",

    "however , away from the tunneling limit , the current product term in ( [ p_but ] ) can not be dropped and the correlation time @xmath139 does not vanish any longer ; the proposal made in ref .   then is to construct the coincidence probability from the combination @xmath184 which requires the measurement of the average currents @xmath185 and @xmath186 in addition to the zero - frequency noise correlator . the problematic step in this construction",
    "is the need for the _ precise quantitative _ knowledge of the correlation time @xmath139 , since this parameter now is part of the evaluation of the coincidence probability itself ( this is different from the above discussion of the tunneling limit where a rough knowledge of @xmath139 was sufficient in order to verify that the current product term can be dropped from ( [ cnnzfn ] ) ) .",
    "the appearance of this additional parameter is a consequence of expressing the equal time correlator @xmath187 , involving all frequencies , through the zero - frequency value @xmath188 alone .",

    "the cross - measurement in different leads implies that the setup is sensitive only to the split - pair part of the scattering wave function @xmath228 which is fully spin - entangled and hence the bell inequality can be maximally violated . in the tunneling limit , the correction term @xmath229 also contributes a signal and spoils the maximal violation , ultimately limiting the use of the tunneling limit to devices with large enough transparency @xmath221 in the well conducting lead ( small enough transparency @xmath11 in the blocked lead ) .",

    "an interesting question concerns the origin of the entanglement detected in the bell inequality measurement described in the present paper .",
    "we note that in refs .  , the entanglement had been attributed to the elastic scattering in the fermi sea , although the proper selection of a projected wave function component during the calculation corresponds to a post - selection . in ref .",
    "post - selection was noted to be the origin of entanglement ; such post - selection creating entanglement is a well known mechanism in optics @xcite . in both of the above cases , the entangled degrees of freedom originated from independent reservoirs",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated in the present case : as shown above , our setup involves a simple normal reservoir injecting spin - singlet correlated pairs of electrons into the source lead which are conveniently described by the wave function @xmath262 .",
    "these _ local _ spin - singlet pairs are subsequently separated in space by a beam splitter and detected in a coincidence measurement .",
    "the measurement is only sensitive to pairs of particles propagating in different arms , implying a post - selection or projection of the scattering wave function during which only its cross term describing a _ split _ spin - singlet pair survives . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that the incoming local spin - singlet , being a simple slater determinant , is not entangled according to the definition given by schliemann _",
    "@xcite however , after the beam splitter the orbital wave function @xmath263 is delocalized between the two leads , @xmath264 . while the scattered state remains a slater determinant @xmath265 , the singlet correlations now can be observed in a coincidence measurement testing the cross - correlations between the leads ` u ' and ` d ' .",
    "hence the original spin - entanglement is produced by the reservoir , but its observation requires proper projection .",
    "it is then difficult to trace a unique origin for the entanglement manifested in the present bell inequality test .",
    "an appropriate setup addressing this question should involve independent reservoirs injecting the particles carrying the degrees of freedom to be entangled , e.g. , particles with opposite spin residing in a slater determinant of the form @xmath266/\\sqrt{2}$ ] which is not entangled in the spin variable .",
    "such an analysis has been presented in ref .   with the result ,",
    "that the orbital projection in the coincidence measurement is sufficient to produce a spin - entangled state .",
    "in conclusion , we find that spin - entangled pairs of electrons exist and leave their trace in the violation of bell inequalities in a mesoscopic setup even in the absence of interaction .",
    "the source of entanglement is traced back to the nature of injected electrons forming a regular stream of locally singlet - correlated particles combined with a post - selection @xcite during the bell type measurement .",
    "the splitter itself does not contribute to the entanglement of the pair , but fulfills the crucial task of separating the spin - entangled constituents of the pair in real space , thus rendering them useful as a quantum resource of entanglement .",
    "while most of the previous analysis of entanglement was restricted to the tunneling limit @xcite , we have overcome this restriction and have demonstrated universal violation of bis in setups based on electron correlators .",
    "we have determined the degree and duration in time of the bi violation and have found pronounced dependencies on the choice of observables .",
