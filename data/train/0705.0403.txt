    "in recent years , there has been an increasing research interest in the control design of multi - agent systems .",
    "many results have been obtained with local rules applied to each agent in a considered multi - agent system .",
    "these neighbor rules for each agent are based on the average of its own information and that of its neighbors or its leader ( fax & murray , 2004 ; jadbabaie , lin , & morse , 2003 ; lin , broucke , & francis , 2004 ; olfati - saber & murray , 2004 ; savkin , 2004 ) .",
    "for example , jadbabaie _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) demonstrated that a simple neighbor rule makes all agents eventually move in the same direction despite the absence of centralized coordination and each agent s set of neighbors changing with time as the system evolves under a joint connection condition . also , with a similar technique , lin _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) studied three formation strategies for groups of mobile autonomous agents .",
    "the stability analysis of multi - vehicle formations was given with a nyquist - type criterion in ( fax & murray , 2004 ) . moreover , by a lyapunov - based approach , olfati - saber _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) solved the average - consensus problem with directed interconnection graphs or time - delays .    in reality",
    ", some variables of the agents and/or the leader in a multi - agent system may not be able to be measured .",
    "( 2004 ) raised this important issue regarding observer design for multi - agent systems , and first tackled this problem .",
    "however , many works remain to be done for the distributed observer design of networks of multiple agents .    with this background ,",
    "we consider a consensus problem with an active leader with an underlying dynamics . here , some variables ( that is , the velocity and maybe the acceleration ) of an active leader can not be measured , and each agent only gets the measured information ( that is , the position ) of the leader once there is a connection between them . in this paper , we propose an  observer \" by inserting an integrator into the loop for each agent to estimate the leader s velocity . to analyze the problem , a lyapunov - based approach is developed . with the proposed estimation rule and a selected lyapunov function ,",
    "the leader - following problem can be solved if the leader s input is known , while the tracking error can also be analyzed if the input is unknown .",
    "to solve coordination problems , graph theory is helpful .",
    "an undirected graph @xmath0 on vertex set @xmath1 contains @xmath2 and a set of unordered pairs @xmath3 , which are called @xmath0 s edges . if there is an edge between two vertices , the two vertices are called adjacent .",
    "a graph is simple if it has no self - loops or repeated edges .",
    "if there is a path between any two vertices of a graph @xmath0 , then @xmath0 is connected , otherwise disconnected .",
    "a subgraph @xmath4 of @xmath0 is an induced subgraph if two vertices of @xmath5 are adjacent in @xmath4 if and only if they are adjacent in @xmath0 .",
    "an induced subgraph @xmath4 of @xmath0 that is maximal , subject to being connected , is called a component of @xmath0 .    here",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath6 agents and a leader . in the sequel ,",
    "the state of agent @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 for @xmath9 . with regarding the @xmath6 agents as the vertices in @xmath2 ,",
    "the relationships between @xmath6 agents can be conveniently described by a simple and undirected graph @xmath10 , which is defined so that @xmath11 defines one of the graph s edges in case agents @xmath7 and @xmath12 are neighbors .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the set of labels of those agents which are neighbors of agent @xmath14 at time @xmath15 .",
    "the weighted adjacency matrix of @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17\\in r^{n\\times n}$ ] , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 if there is an edge between agent @xmath7 and agent @xmath12 ) .",
    "its degree matrix @xmath21 is a diagonal matrix , where diagonal elements @xmath22 for @xmath9 .",
    "then the laplacian of the weighted graph is defined as @xmath23 which is symmetric . in what follows",
    ", we mainly concern a graph @xmath24 associated with the system consisting of @xmath6 agents and one leader .",
    "in fact , @xmath24 contains @xmath6 agents ( related to graph @xmath16 ) and the leader with directed edges from some agents to the leader . by  the graph , @xmath24 , of this system is connected \" , we mean that at least one agent in each component of @xmath16 is connected to the leader .    for the multi - agent system under consideration , the relationships between neighbors ( and the interconnection topology ) change over time .",
    "suppose that there is an infinite sequence of bounded , non - overlapping , contiguous time - intervals @xmath25 , starting at @xmath26 .",
    "denote @xmath27 as a set of the graphs with all possible topologies , which includes all possible interconnection graphs ( involving @xmath6 agents and a leader ) , and denote @xmath28 as its index set . to describe the variable interconnection topology ,",
    "we define a switching signal @xmath29 , which is piecewise - constant . therefore , @xmath30 and the connection weight @xmath31 are time - varying , and moreover , laplacian @xmath32 associated with the switching interconnection graph is also time - varying ( switched at @xmath33 ) , though it is a time - invariant matrix in any interval @xmath34 . in our problem",
    ", we assume that there are fixed positive constants @xmath35 such that @xmath36 meanwhile , the connection weight between agent @xmath7 and the leader , denoted by @xmath37 , is time - varying , too .",
    "we assume that there are fixed positive constants @xmath38 such that @xmath39    the next lemma was given in horn and johnson ( 1985 ) , to check the positive definiteness of a matrix .",
    "[ lem1 ] suppose that a symmetric matrix is partitioned as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are square .",
    "@xmath43 is positive definite if and only if both @xmath41 and @xmath44 are positive definite .",
    "the following result is well - known in algebraic graph theory ( godsil & royle , 2001 ) and establishes a direct relationship between the graph connectivity and its lapalcian .",
    "[ lem2 ] let @xmath0 be a graph on @xmath6 vertices with laplacian @xmath45 .",
    "denote the eigenvalues of @xmath45 by @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 and @xmath49^{t}\\in r^n$ ] is its eigenvector .",
    "moreover , if @xmath16 is connected , @xmath50 .    in this paper ,",
    "all the considered agents move in a plane : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the control input .",
    "the leader of this considered multi - agent system is active ; that is , its state variables keep changing .",
    "its underlying dynamics can be expressed as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the measured output and @xmath55 is the ( acceleration ) input .",
    "note that ( [ model0 ] ) is completely different from the agent dynamics ( [ modela ] ) .",
    "in other words , the agents will track a leader with a different dynamics .",
    "in our problem formulation , the input @xmath55 may not be completely known .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 is known and @xmath57 is unknown but bounded with a given upper bound @xmath58 ( that is , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the input @xmath55 is known if and only if @xmath60 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath61 is the only variable that can be obtained directly by the agents when they are connected to the leader .",
    "our aim here is to propose a decentralized control scheme for each agent to follow the leader ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) .",
    "since @xmath63 can not be measured even when the agents are connected to the leader , its value can not be used in the control design .",
    "instead , we have to estimate @xmath64 during the evolution .",
    "note that , each agent has to estimate @xmath64 only by the information obtained from its neighbors in a decentralized way .",
    "the estimate of @xmath63 by agent @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath65 ( @xmath9 ) . therefore , for each agent , the local control scheme consists of two parts :    * a neighbor - based feedback law : @xmath66\\\\ & + v_i,\\quad k>0 , \\ ; i=1,\\cdots , n , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the set consisting of agent @xmath7 s neighbor agents ; * a dynamic neighbor - based system to estimate @xmath64 @xmath67,\\quad i=1,\\cdots , n , \\end{split}\\ ] ] for some positive constant @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , ( [ update1 ] ) , can be viewed as an  observer \" in some sense .",
    "note that @xmath52 in ( [ con ] ) is a local controller of agent @xmath7 , which only depends on the information from its neighbors , and , in fact , when @xmath69 , the proposed control law ( [ con ] ) is consistent with the one given in olfati - saber and murray ( 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , with the neighbor - based estimation rule in a form of observer ( [ update1 ] ) to estimate the leader s velocity , each agent relies only on the locally available information at every moment . in other words ,",
    "each agent can not  observe \" or  estimate \" the leader directly based on the measured information of the leader if it is not connected to the leader . in fact , it has to collect the information of the leader in a distributed way from its neighbor agents .",
    "take @xmath70 regarding the switching interconnection graphs , the closed - loop system can be expressed as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( for any positive integer @xmath73 ) is the identity matrix and @xmath74 denotes the kronecker product , @xmath75 is a piecewise constant switching signal with successive switching times , @xmath76 is an @xmath77 diagonal matrix whose @xmath7th diagonal element is @xmath78 at time @xmath15 , @xmath79 is the laplacian for the @xmath6 agents . note",
    "that , even in the case when the interconnection graph is connected , @xmath78 may be always 0 for some @xmath7 , and therefore , @xmath76 may not be of full rank .",
    "denote @xmath80 and @xmath81 . because @xmath82 ( invoking lemma [ lem2 ] ) , we can obtain an error dynamics of ( [ model1 ] ) as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84",
    "in this section , we investigate the consensus problem of multi - agent system ( [ model1 ] ) , or the convergence analysis of system ( [ model2 ] ) . if the information of the input @xmath55 can be used in local control design , we can prove that all the agents can follow the leader , though the leader keeps changing .",
    "if not , we can also get some estimation of the tracking error .",
    "we first assume that the interconnection graph @xmath24 is always connected , though the interconnection topology keeps changing ; and then we consider an extended case .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath24 is connected if at least one agent in each of its component is connected with the leader . to be specific , if there are @xmath85 components , then the laplacian @xmath86 ( for any @xmath87 ) of the graph associated with @xmath6 agents have @xmath88 zero eigenvalues . for simplicity",
    ", we can rearrange the indices of @xmath6 agents such that @xmath86 can be rewritten as a block diagonal matrix : @xmath89 where each block matrix @xmath90 is also a laplacian of the corresponding component .",
    "for convenience , denote @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the weighted laplacian and @xmath93 is the diagonal matrix as defined in section 2 .",
    "the next lemma is given for @xmath94 .",
    "[ lem3 ] if graph @xmath95 is connected , then the symmetric matrix @xmath94 associated with @xmath95 is positive definite .",
    "proof : we only need to prove the case when @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the eigenvalues of laplacian @xmath92 in the increasing order . from lemma [ lem2 ] , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "denote @xmath6 eigenvectors of @xmath92 by @xmath100 , with @xmath101 , an eigenvector of @xmath92 corresponding to @xmath102 . then any nonzero vector @xmath103 can be expressed by @xmath104 for some constants @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , @xmath106 since there is at least one agent connected to the leader . without loss of generality",
    ", we assume @xmath107 for some @xmath12 , and it is obvious @xmath108 . therefore ,",
    "in either the case when @xmath109 ( so @xmath110 ) or the case when @xmath111 for some @xmath112 , we always have @xmath113 for @xmath114 which implies the conclusion .    ' '' ''    based on lemma [ lem3 ] and the fact that the set @xmath115 is finite , @xmath116 is fixed and depends directly on the constants @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 given in ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "its estimation is also related to the minimum nonzero eigenvalue of laplacian @xmath92 , which has been widely studied in different situations ( merris , 1994 ) .    in some existing works , including jadbabaie , lin , & morse ( 2003 ) and lin , broucke , & francis ( 2004 ) , the convergence analysis depends on theory of nonnegative matrices or stochastic matrices .",
    "however , @xmath120 of system ( [ model2 ] ) fails to be transformed easily to a matrix with some properties related to stochastic matrices , and therefore , the effective methods used in jadbabaie , lin , & morse ( 2003 ) or lin , broucke , & francis ( 2004 ) may not work . here",

    ". moreover , if @xmath55 is known ( i.e. , @xmath126 or @xmath127 ) , @xmath128    proof : take a lyapunov function @xmath129 with symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath130    the interconnection graph is time - varying , but the interconnection graph associated with @xmath131 for some @xmath132 is connected on an interval @xmath133 with its topology unchanged . consider the derivative of @xmath134 : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a positive definite matrix because @xmath137 and @xmath94 are positive definite ( by virtue of ( [ constk ] ) , lemma [ lem1 ] and lemma [ lem3 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the ( at most ) @xmath139 different eigenvalues of @xmath140 though @xmath141 defined in ( [ matrixq ] ) .",

    "clearly , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath140 will be found in the form of @xmath146 for some @xmath7 .",

    "next , we consider an extended case : the interconnection graph is not always connected .",
    "let @xmath165 be a ( sufficient large ) constant , and then we have a sequence of interval @xmath166 with @xmath167 . each interval @xmath168 consists of a number of intervals ( still expressed in the form of @xmath169 , during which the interconnection graph is time - invariant ) , including the intervals during which the graphs are connected and those during which the graphs are not .",
