    "many problems in science and engineering require the sorting , or ordering , of large amounts of multivariate data . since there is no canonical linear criterion for sorting data in dimensions greater than one , many different methods for sorting",
    "have been proposed to address various problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many of these algorithms abandon the idea of a linear ordering , and instead sort the data into layers according to some set of criteria .",
    "we consider here _ nondominated sorting _ , which arranges a set of points in euclidean space into layers by repeatedly removing the set of minimal elements .",

    "nondominated sorting is widely used in multi - objective optimization , where it is the basis of the popular and effective genetic and evolutionary algorithms  @xcite . of course , multi - objective optimization is ubiquitous in engineering and scientific contexts , such as control theory and path planning  @xcite , gene selection and ranking  @xcite , data clustering  @xcite , database systems  @xcite , image processing and computer vision  @xcite , and some recent machine learning problems  @xcite .",
    "nondominated sorting is also equivalent to the longest chain problem , which has a long history in probability and combinatorics  @xcite .",

    "this result shows that nondominated sorting of massive datasets , which are common in big data applications  @xcite , can be approximated by solving a partial differential equation ( pde ) . in @xcite",
    ", we exploited this idea to propose a fast approximate nondominated sorting algorithm based on estimating @xmath29 from the data @xmath6 and solving ( p ) numerically .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : prev ] , given in @xcite , is based on the following continuum variational problem : @xmath41 where the supremum is over all @xmath42 curves @xmath43",
    "\\to [ 0,\\infty)^d$ ] that are monotone nondecreasing in all coordinates and satisfy @xmath44 .",
    "this can be viewed as a type of stochastic homogenization of the longest chain problem , where the curves @xmath45 are continuum versions of chains .",
    "the variational problem first appeared in two dimensions in @xcite .",
    "the pde ( p ) arises as the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation associated with @xcite .",
    "we used the same ideas to prove a similar hamilton - jacobi equation continuum limit for the directed last passage percolation model in statistical physics , which also has an obvious discrete variational formulation  @xcite .",

    "many of the proofs are based on applying subadditive ergodic theory to a representation formula for the solution , like the hopf - lax formula , or more generally , a control theoretic interpretation @xcite .",
    "these techniques are similar in spirit to our original proof of theorem [ thm : prev ] that was based on the variational representation of @xmath36 given in .",
    "recently , there has been significant interest in stochastic homogenization techniques that do not require a variational interpretation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give an alternative proof of theorem [ thm : prev ] that uses a direct verification argument , and completely avoids using the variational interpretation of ( p ) .",
    "the argument is based on a heuristic derivation of ( p ) that originally appeared in @xcite .",
    "we review this argument , which is reminiscent of dimensional analysis , in section [ sec : informal ] .",
    "we believe this proof is new in the stochastic homogenization literature , and it seems to be more robust than arguments based on variational principles .",
    "we present the proof in the simplest setting in this paper , but we believe it can be substantially generalized . in future work , we plan to apply this proof technique to other stochastic growth models that do not stem from underlying variational principles .",
    "to simplify the presentation , we model the data here using a poisson point process . given a nonnegative function @xmath51 , we denote by @xmath52 a poisson point process with intensity function @xmath29 .",

    "[ thm : cont ] let @xmath66 such that ( p ) has a unique nondecreasing viscosity solution @xmath36 .",
    "then with probability one @xmath70    in @xcite , we showed that there exists a unique nondecreasing viscosity solution of ( p ) whenever @xmath29 is uniformly continuous on an open and bounded set @xmath30 with lipschitz boundary , and @xmath32 for @xmath71 .",
    "in @xcite we extended this uniqueness result to the case where @xmath29 is continuous on @xmath35 , which allows the support of @xmath29 to be non - compact .",

    "due to the sharp concentration of measure results established by frieze @xcite , bollobs and brightwell @xcite , and more recently by talagrand @xcite , the monotonicity property is no longer required for almost sure convergence .",
    "thus , our proof of theorem [ thm : cont ] does not assume any particular construction of @xmath72 ( see theorem [ thm : complete ] ) .",
    "we should mention , however , that if we do construct a family of poisson point processes @xmath76 on a common probability space in such a way that @xmath77 then the function @xmath78)$ ] is monotone nondecreasing as a function of @xmath79 for _ every _ realization .",

    "one way to ensure that is satisfied is to construct @xmath82 via a generalization of  @xcite .",
    "as motivation , let us give an informal derivation of the hamilton - jacobi pde continuum limit ( p ) .",
    "this derivation was originally given in a slightly different form in @xcite , and our proof of theorem [ thm : cont ] is based on these heuristics .",
    "suppose @xmath83 is continuous and that @xmath84 uniformly with probability one for some @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "the argument below not only derives ( p ) , but also suggests the order of growth @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath27 is nondecreasing , the uniform limit @xmath36 must be nondecreasing and so @xmath88 for all @xmath38 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath89 for all @xmath38 . fix @xmath90 with @xmath91 and consider the quantity @xmath92 .",
    "this is approximately the number of pareto fronts passing between @xmath93 and @xmath94 when @xmath7 is large .",
    "when counting these fronts , we may restrict ourselves to poisson points falling in the set @xmath95 this is because any points in @xmath96 will be on previous pareto fronts and only points that are coordinatewise less than @xmath94 can influence the pareto rank of @xmath94 .",
    "see figure [ fig : derivation ] for a depiction of this region and some quantities from the derivation .",
    "since @xmath97 for all @xmath38 , and @xmath36 is @xmath42 , @xmath57 is well approximated for small @xmath98 by a simplex with orthogonal corner , and the points within @xmath57 are approximately uniformly distributed .",
    "let @xmath99 denote the number of poisson points falling in @xmath57 .",
    "since we can scale the simplex into a standard simplex while preserving the pareto fronts within @xmath57 , it is reasonable to conjecture that the number of pareto fronts within @xmath57 ( or the length of a longest chain in @xmath57 ) is asymptotic to @xmath100 for some constant @xmath101 , independent of @xmath93 .    by the law of large numbers",
    ", we have @xmath102 .",

    ", we see that the main ingredients are an invariance with respect to scaling along coordinate axes , and some basic properties of the coordinatewise partial order .",
    "it is intriguing that we can derive the order of growth @xmath119 and the continuum limit ( p ) from such basic information .",
    "this seems analogous to dimensional analysis arguments in applied mathematics , which use ideas like self - similarity and scaling to derive fundamental laws for natural phenomena  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental feature of dimensional analysis is that , like our argument above , it usually gives no information about the constants of proportionality .",
    "contrary to dimensional analysis , which is typically nonrigorous , we show in this paper that the argument above can be made rigorous using the framework of viscosity solutions .      our new proof of theorem [ thm : cont ] is a rigorous version of the heuristic dimensional analysis argument given in section [ sec : informal ] .",
    "the main ideas used in our proof draw some inspiration from the barles - souganidis framework for convergence of numerical schemes @xcite .",
    "the barles - souganidis framework establishes convergence of any numerical scheme that is monotone , consistent , and stable , provided the pde admits a strong comparison principle . in our proof of theorem [ thm : cont ] , we view @xmath27 as a numerical approximation of the viscostiy solution of ( p ) , and use ideas that parallel monotonicity , stability and consistency to prove convergence to the viscosity solution of ( p ) .",
    "the longest chain problem is monotone in the following sense : for any finite sets @xmath120 , @xmath121 when proving convergence of numerical schemes to viscosity solutions , monotonicity of the scheme is used to replace the numerical solution by a smooth test function for which consistency is trivial .",
    "the monotonicity property is used for precisely the same purpose in the proof of theorem [ thm : cont ] , though consistency is non - trivial in this setting .",
    "stability of numerical schemes for pde usually refers to a uniform bound on the numerical solutions that is independent of the grid resolution . here",
    ", we use a type of asymptotic equicontinuity .",
    "namely , in theorem [ thm : holder2 ] we show that a bound of the form @xmath122 with probability one .",
    "the stability estimate and the monotonicity of @xmath27 can be combined with the arzel - ascoli theorem to show that for every realization @xmath75 in a probability one event @xmath123 , there exists a subsequence @xmath124 converging locally uniformly on @xmath35 to a locally hlder - continuous function @xmath125 .",
    "the final step in the proof is to use consistency and monotonicity to identify @xmath125 as the unique nondecreasing viscosity solution of ( p ) .",
    "our consistency result , theorem [ thm : con ] , is a statement on the asymptotic length of a longest chain in sets resembling the approximate simplex used in the heuristic derivation .",
    "namely , for a smooth test function @xmath126 with @xmath127 for all @xmath38 , we prove asymptotics of the form @xmath128 as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 notice the set @xmath131 is similar to the set @xmath57 used in the heuristic derivation and defined in .",
    "the main difference is that @xmath131 is defined using a smooth test function , and more importantly , it is defined by looking `` backward '' from the point @xmath93 , instead of looking `` forward '' as in .",
    "this respects the natural domain of dependence of the nondominated sorting problem , and allows us to use the monotonicity of @xmath132 in the proof of theorem [ thm : cont ] .",
