    "there exists overwhelming observational evidence for the present acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "the accelerating universe leads to a future event horizon from beyond which it is not possible for any signal to reach us . on the other hand",
    ", observations also tell us that our universe is inhomogeneous up to the scales of super clusters of galaxies . the idea that backreaction originating from density inhomogeneities could lead to modifications in evolution of the universe as described by the background friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric at large scales has gained popularity in recent years @xcite . here",
    "we show that backreaction in the presence of the cosmological event horizon could have a remarkable consequence of ushering in another decelerated era beyond the present accelerating epoch .    in spite of numerous creative ideas proposed for the present acceleration @xcite",
    ", there is still a lack of convincing explanation of this phenomenon .",
    "the simplest possible explanation provided by a cosmological constant is endowed with conceptual problems @xcite .",
    "alternative mechanisms based on either modifications of the gravitational theory , or invoking extra fields suffer from the coincidence problem , as to why the era of acceleration begins around the same era when the universe becomes structured .",
    "the ultimate fate of our universe remains clouded in considerable mystery .",
    "backreaction from inhomogeneities provides an interesting platform for investigating this issue without invoking additional physics , since the effects of backreaction gain stength as the inhomogeneities develop into structures around the present era .",
    "approaches have been developed to calculate the effect of inhomegeneous matter distibution on the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "arguments in favour of the viability of backreaction seem rather compelling @xcite , though there exists debate on the impact of inhomogeneities on observables of an overall homogeneous frw model @xcite , and on the magnitude of backreaction modulated by the effect of shear between overdense and underdense regions @xcite .",
    "using the framework fomulated by buchert @xcite it has been shown @xcite that backreaction could lead to an accelerated expansion during the present epoch .",
    "a notable application of the formalism has been developed by wiltshire showing an apparent volume acceleration of the universe based on the different lapse of time between the underdense and overdense regions @xcite .",
    "further , gauge invariant averages in the buchert framework have also been constructed recently @xcite .    while upcoming observations may ultimately decide whether backreaction from density inhomogeneities drives the present acceleration , the above studies @xcite have highlighted that backreaction could be an important ingredient of the evolution of our universe . here",
    "we explore this issue with a fresh perspective , _ viz .",
    "_ , the impact of the event horizon on cosmological backreaction .",
    "the currently accelerating epoch dictates the existence of an event horizon since the transition from the previously matter dominated decelerating expansion .",
    "since backreaction is evaluated from the global distribution of matter inhomogeneities , the event horizon demarcates the spatial regions which are causally connected to us and hence impact the evolution of our part of the universe . in the present work",
    "we investigate the consequences of backreaction in presence of the horizon .",
    "such an approach has remained unexplored in previous studies of backreaction . it may be noted that the formalism of back reaction @xcite has been criticized on the grounds that the average is taken on a space like hypersurface , while observations are made along and inside the past light cone @xcite .",
    "our present analysis , by considering an effect due to the event horizon , introduces an element of light cone physics from a somewhat different perspective .",
    "we show that backreaction with the event horizon could lead to the possibility of transition to a decelerated future era .",
    "in the framework developed by buchert @xcite for the universe filled with an irrotational fluid of dust the spacetime is foliated into floworthogonal hypersurfaces featuring the lineelement @xmath0 , where the proper time @xmath1 labels the hypersurfaces and @xmath2 are gaussian normal coordinates ( locating freefalling fluid elements or generalized fundamental observers ) in the hypersurfaces , and @xmath3 is the full inhomogeneous three metric of the hypersurfaces of constant proper time . for a compact spatial domain @xmath4 whose volume is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , the scale factor @xmath7 encodes the average stretch of all directions of the domain .",
    "the einstein equations then lead to @xcite @xmath8 where the average of the scalar quantities on the domain @xmath4 is defined as @xmath9 , and where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the local matter density , the ricci - scalar of the three - metric @xmath13 , and the domain dependent hubble rate @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the kinematical backreaction @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the local expansion rate and @xmath18 is the squared rate of shear .",
    "@xmath15 encodes the departure from homogeneity .",
    "the `` global '' domain @xmath4 is assumed to be separated into subregions @xmath19 which themselves consist of elementary space entities @xmath20 that may be associated with some averaging length scale , i.e. , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 for all @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "analogous to the scale factor for the global domain , a scale factor @xmath26 for each of the subregions @xmath19 can be defined such that @xmath27 , and hence @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the initial volume fraction of the subregion @xmath19 .",
    "the average of the scalar valued function @xmath30 on the domain @xmath4 , may then be split into the averages of @xmath30 on the subregions @xmath19 in the form , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , is the volume fraction of the subregion @xmath19 . due to the @xmath33 term , the expression for the backreaction @xmath15 is given by @xmath34 where , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are defined in @xmath19 in the same way as @xmath15 and @xmath12 are defined in @xmath4 .",
    "the shear part @xmath37 is completely absorbed in @xmath35 whereas the variance of the local expansion rates @xmath38 is partly contained in @xmath35 but also generates the extra term @xmath39 .",
    "this is because the part of the variance that is present in @xmath35 , namely @xmath40 only takes into account points inside @xmath19 . to restore the variance that comes from combining points of @xmath19 with others in @xmath41 , the extra term containing the averaged hubble rate emerges .",
    "note here that the above formulation of the backreaction holds in the case when there is no interaction between the overdense and the underdense subregions .",
    "now from eq .",
    "one gets @xmath42 following the simplifying assumption of ref.@xcite , ( which captures the essential physics ) we work with only two subregions . clubbing those parts of @xmath4 which consist of initial overdensity as @xmath43 ( called `` wall '' ) , and those with initial underdensity as @xmath44 ( called `` void '' ) , such that @xmath45 , one obtains @xmath46 , with similar expressions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 here @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since the global domain @xmath4 is large enough for a scale of homogeneity to be associated with it , one can write @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a function of the frw comoving radial coordinate @xmath55 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath56 , and hence , the volume average scale factor @xmath57 and the frw scale factor @xmath58 are related by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is constant in time .",
    "thus , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the frw hubble parameter associated with @xmath4 .",
    "though in general @xmath63 and @xmath64 could differ on even large scales @xcite , the above approximation is valid for small metric perturbations .",
    "we now come to the central issue of the paper , as to what happens to the evolution of the universe once the present stage of acceleration sets in .",
    "note henceforth , we do not need to necessarily assume that the acceleration is due to backreaction @xcite . for the purpose of our present analysis",
    ", it suffices to consider the observed accelerated phase of the universe @xcite that could occur due to any of a variety of mechanisms @xcite .",
    "given that we are undergoing a stage of acceleration since transition from an era of structure formation , our aim here is to explore the subsequent evolution of the universe due to the effects of backreaction in presence of the cosmic event horizon .",
    "though in general , spatial and light cone distances and corresponding accelerations could be different , as shown explicitly in the framework of ltb models @xcite , an approximation for the event horizon which forms at the onset of acceleration could be defined by @xmath65 in the same spirit as @xmath66 .",
    "is plotted versus time ( @xmath67 ) assuming a constant horizon .",
    "the values for the various parameters used are ( i ) @xmath68 , ( ii ) @xmath69 , ( iii ) @xmath70 , and ( iv ) @xmath71.,height=207 ]    following the buchert framework @xcite as discussed above , the global domain @xmath4 is divided into a collection of overdense regions @xmath72 , with total volume @xmath73 , and underdense regions @xmath74 with corresponding volume @xmath75 .",
    "assuming that the scale factors of the regions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants , one has @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant , and similarly for @xmath86 .",
    "the volume fraction of the subdomain @xmath43 is given by @xmath87 which can be rewritten in terms of the corresponding scale factors as @xmath88 . since an event horizon forms , only those regions of @xmath4 that are within the event horion are accessible to us .",
    "hence , in this case an apparent volume fraction @xmath89 given by @xmath90 is introduced . from eq.([eq:19 ] ) it follows that @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a constant . normalizing the total accessible volume in the presence of the event horizon , we can write @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the apparent volume fraction for the subdomain @xmath44 .",
    "it hence follows that the global acceleration equation ( [ eq:15 ] ) is now given by @xmath95 in order to obtain the future evolution of the universe with backreaction in presence of the event horizon , one has to solve the above equation for the scale factor with the event horizon @xmath96 given by eq.([horizon ] ) .",
    "in what follows we will eventually obtain numerical solutions of the above integro - differential equations .",
    "however , it is first instructive to obtain some physical insight of the evolution by taking recourse to a simple approximation .    to this end ,",
    "let us for the moment model the onset of the present acceleration of the universe by an exponential expansion , keeping our analysis close to observations",
    ". specifically , we set @xmath97 in eq.([horizon ] ) only .",
    "( we will see later that this rather crude approximation does indeed give rise to results that are qualitatively similar to the ones obtained through numerical analysis ) . using @xmath98 , where @xmath62 is the frw hubble parameter associated with @xmath4 , it follows that @xmath99 , a constant which we substitute in eq.([eq:26 ] ) . with this substitution ,",
    "the global acceleration @xmath100 vanishes at times given by @xmath101\\label{solnt}\\ ] ] the scale factor of the `` wall '' grows as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "eq . corresponds to real time solutions for @xmath104\\label{alphacond}$ ] .",
    "now , let us consider the following two cases separately : _ case i : _ @xmath105 and @xmath106 . there exist two real solutions ( [ solnt ] ) corresponding to two values of time when the global acceleration vanishes .",
    "in fig.1 we plot a dimensionless global acceleration parameter @xmath107 with time using eq.(([eq:26 ] ) ) . the curves ( i ) and ( ii ) correspond to this case showing that the universe first enters the epoch of acceleration due to backreaction , which subsequently slows down and finally vanishes at the onset of another decelerating era in the future . _ case ii : _ @xmath108 and @xmath106 . from ( [ solnt ] )",
    "it follows that there is only one real solution ( minus sign for the square root ) .",
    "this case models the universe which accelerates due to some other mechanism ( not backreaction ) , but subsequently enters an epoch of deceleration due to backreaction of inhomogeneities in the presence of the event horizon ( see curves ( iii ) and ( iv ) of fig.1 ) .",
    "the plots in fig.1 have been done taking the standard values of the parameters @xmath109 while choosing the appropriate range for the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 , as given in the figure caption .",
    "based on the n - body simulation values used in @xcite we also take @xmath110 . using the relation @xmath111 - 1 $ ] , where @xmath112 corresponds to the transition time in the past , the red - shifts for the transition could be estimated .",
    "for example , for the data used in curve ( i ) , the transition from deceleration to acceleration occurs at @xmath113 , and for curve ( ii ) we have @xmath114 ( which are close to the @xmath115cdm value for the standard transition redshift @xcite ) .",
    "we now study the acceleration equation ( [ eq:26 ] ) numerically without assuming _ a priori _ any behaviour for the horizon . keeping with the spirit of our analysis",
    ", we assume that the universe has entered the accelerated stage and thus a cosmic event horizon has formed .",
    "this ensures that @xmath96 defined by ( [ horizon ] ) will be finite valued , enabling us to replace the integral equation ( [ horizon ] ) by @xmath116 thus , the evolution of the scale factor is now governed by the set of coupled differential equations ( [ eq:26 ] ) and ( [ eq:28 ] ) .",
    "we numerically integrate these equations by using as an `` initial condition '' the observational constraint @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the current value of the deceleration parameter , and using the solution for the scale factor plot the global acceleration versus time in fig.2 ( thus all the curves in fig.2 are set to intersect at the point @xmath119 ) .",
    "the values of the other parameters including @xmath80 and @xmath81 are chosen to be the same as in the corresponding curves of the exponential case .",
    "as can be seen from fig.2 , the nature of the plots is quite similar to the ones that were obtained in the case assuming a constant event horizon , with the @xmath120 curves signifying only one transition between acceleration and deceleration in the future .",
    "the differences in the various slopes and also in the scale for the dimensionless global acceleration parameter in the two cases arise as a result of the approximation of constant horizon used in the former , as well as due to the choice of the condition @xmath117 used in the latter .",
    "is plotted versus time ( @xmath67 ) as obtained through numerical integration , with the  initial condition of @xmath121 .",
    "the values for the various parameters used are chosen to be the same as in the corresponding plots of fig.1.,height=207 ]",
    "to summarize , in this work we have explored the effect of backreaction due to inhomogeneities on the evolution of the universe undergoing present acceleration .",
    "we have shown that the presence of the cosmic event horizon causes the acceleration to slow down significantly with time .",
    "our results indicate the fascinating possibility of backreaction being responsible not only for the present acceleration as shown in earlier works @xcite , but also leading to a transition to another decelerated era in the future .",
    "another possibility following from our analysis is of the universe currently accelerating due to a different mechanism @xcite , but with backreaction @xcite later causing acceleration to slow down .",
    "our prediction of the future slowing down of acceleration seems to fit smoothly with the earlier era of structure formation and the transition to acceleration in the standard @xmath115cdm model , as shown here ( transition red - shift @xmath122 ) .    before concluding , in context of the formalism used in the present work",
    "it may be worthwhile to recapitulate some of the present debate in the literature regarding averaging on a space like hypersurface @xcite as compared to taking the average on the past light cone .",
    "the usefulness of the expansion rate averaged on any hypersurface is determined by relating it to observed quantities .",
    "it has been observed that the redshift and distance can be expressed in terms of the average geometry alone , provided that the contribution of the null shear is negligible @xcite .",
    "observationally , the shear is known to be indeed small @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it has been claimed that neither averaging on a constant time hypersurface nor light cone averaging is easy to connect with the observations corresponding to parameters of the @xmath115cdm model @xcite .",
    "the task of developing a procedure for light cone averaging is an ambitious program and till date there is no standard formalism to do so . in a recent paper three different types of light cone averaging",
    "have been proposed @xcite , though much work remains to be done in order to apply their technique to the problem of cosmic acceleration . on the other hand",
    ", our present work introduces an element of light cone physics from another perspective by considering an effect due to the event horizon .",
    "finally , it may be noted that though the event horizon is observer dependent , it follows from the symmetry of the equations ( [ eq:15 ] ) and ( [ voidfrac ] ) that our analysis leads to similar conclusions for a `` void '' centric observer , as it does for a `` wall '' centric one .",
    "note also that our analysis is valid while the event horizon exists .",
    "hence , if the acceleration vanishes at some epoch in the future , one needs to consider backreaction without the event horizon beyond that epoch .",
    "the scales which crossed ouside the horizon earlier , will begin re - entering with backreaction from their associated inhomogeneities impacting the evolution .",
    "such a scenario is somewhat reminiscent of the horizon crossing of modes during inflation in the early universe , and their subsequent reentry with rich cosmological consequences . in the present context",
    ", the impact on the global evolution of the reentering scales needs to be studied further .",
    "moreover , it would be worthwhile to investigate effects of the cosmic event horizon on other models of backreaction in order to make more generic predictions of observational interest ."
