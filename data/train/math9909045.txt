    "it is well  known @xcite that , analogous to the classical group  theoretical method , the @xmath1deformation of @xmath3 can be constructed by factoring out a certain two  sided hopf ideal from the multiparameter @xmath1deformation of @xmath2 .",
    "this is an interesting procedure , allowing , for example , the construction of a differential calculus on the quantum plane by a reduction of the differential calculus on the quantum group . in this paper",
    ", we apply the same construction to the jordanian deformation .",
    "the multiparameter jordanian deformation of @xmath2 is first produced by a contraction from the corresponding @xmath1deformation and this is then used to construct the inhomogeneous group by factorisation .",
    "the hopf -structure of @xmath4 is given explicitly and we show that it is possible to derive from this a coaction of a modified version of @xmath5 on the jordanian quantum plane . + note : in this paper , we denote @xmath1deformed structures using the ( multiparameter ) subscript @xmath6 and structures that have been contracted to the jordanian form are written with a subscript @xmath7 ( e.g @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "following aschieri and castellani [ 1 ] , the @xmath11matrix for @xmath8 ( where @xmath12 ) can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the matrix indices of @xmath17 run , in order , through the set @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "this numbering system is chosen to clearly show the embedding of the @xmath27 matrix in the @xmath17 matrix which , in turn , allows the hopf structure of larger algebra to be analysed in terms of the simpler one .",
    "the hopf structure of @xmath8 is given by the @xmath28 relations with @xmath29matrix @xmath30 and the multiparameter inhomogeneous @xmath1deformation @xmath31 is the quantum homogeneous space @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the two  sided hopf ideal generated by the @xmath29matrix elements @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath11matrix of the jordanian ( or @xmath35deformation ) can be viewed as a singular limit of a similarity transformation on the @xmath1deformation @xmath11matrix @xcite@xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 be a matrix dependent on a contraction parameter @xmath37 which is itself a function of one of the deformation parameters of the @xmath1deformed algebra .",
    "this can be used to define a transformed @xmath1deformed @xmath11matrix @xmath38 the @xmath11matrix of the jordanian deformation is then obtained by taking a limiting value of the parameter @xmath39 . even though the contraction parameter @xmath39 is undefined in this limit , the new @xmath11matrix is finite and gives rise to a new quantum group structure through the @xmath28relations .",
    "for example , in the contraction process which takes @xmath40 to @xmath41 , the contraction matrix is @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath35 a new free parameter .",
    "+ it has been shown by alishahiha @xcite that , in the extension of this procedure to the construction of @xmath9 , there are essentially two choices of contraction matrix .",
    "the first has been used in a number of papers , e.g. by quesne @xcite and takes the form @xmath44    there is , however , a second choice ( also mentioned in @xcite but not pursued there since it gives trivial results for the single  parameter @xmath1deformation ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47 contraction matrix @xmath48 with @xmath49 . in this present work ,",
    "we take @xmath50 as our contraction matrix because , unlike the matrix @xmath51 , after contraction it allows a non  trivial embedding of @xmath52 in @xmath53 in a manner similar to the @xmath1deformed case .",
    "it is then possible to perform the quotient construction for the inhomogeneous quantum group .",
    "+ if the similarity transformation is made using the matrix @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the matrix @xmath56 and @xmath52 is the @xmath11matrix for the multiparameter jordanian deformation of @xmath57 @xmath58 the free parameters @xmath59 appear as limits in the contraction process while the parameter @xmath60 survives the contraction process .",
    "the result is a four parameter jordanian defomation of @xmath2 .",
    "we denote the @xmath29matrix for the jordanian deformation by @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the algebra structure of the quantum group is obtained through the @xmath28procedure . for the commutation relations between the elements of the matrix @xmath29",
    ", we have the usual relations between the generators of the multiparametric jordanian deformation of @xmath57 : @xmath65 =   nb^2   & [ a , c ] = m(\\delta - a^2 )    & [ a , d ] = nbd - mba   \\\\    { [ } { b},{d } { ] } = -mb^2 & [ b , c ] = -mba -ndb   & [ c , d ] = n(d^2 - \\delta )   \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the quantum determinant of the submatrix @xmath29 @xmath67 with commutation relation @xmath68 = ( m - n ) \\delta b & [ \\delta , b ] = 0   & [ \\delta , c ] = ( m - n ) ( \\delta d - a \\delta ) & [ \\delta , d ] = ( n - m ) \\delta b   \\end{array}\\ ] ] thus @xmath66 is not central in the ( sub  hopf ) algebra generated by elements of @xmath29 unless @xmath69 .",
    "+ the relations between @xmath29 and @xmath70 are given by @xmath71 = \\frac{k}{p}fb & [ b , f ] = 0 & [ c , f ] = \\frac{k}{p}(fd -af ) & [ d , f ] = -\\frac{k}{p}bf \\end{array}\\ ] ] those between @xmath29 and @xmath72 are @xmath73_p = kxb & [ b , x]_p = 0 \\\\ { [ } c , x]_p = kxd + max & [ d , x]_p = mbx \\\\ { [ } { a},{y}{]}_p = kyb - max & [ b , y]_p = -mbx \\\\ { [ } c , y]_p = kyd + ncx -nay - mnax &   [ d , y]_p = ndx - nby -mnbx \\\\ \\delta x = p^2 x \\delta &   \\delta y = p^2 y \\delta + ( n - m ) \\delta x   \\end{array}\\ ] ] while those between @xmath70 and @xmath72 give @xmath74_p = 0 & [ f , y]_p = -kxf \\end{array}\\ ] ] the commutation relations between the elements of @xmath72 are the usual relations for the jordanian quantum plane @xmath75 : @xmath76 = -mx^2\\ ] ] there are also similar commutation relations between the elements of @xmath29 , @xmath70 and @xmath77 , as well as cross - relations between @xmath72 and @xmath77 .      the coalgebraic structure of the hopf algebra is the usual one : @xmath78 with antipode @xmath79 where we append to the algebra , the element @xmath80 . in terms of these elements ,",
    "the quantum determinant of the @xmath29-matrix @xmath81 is @xmath82 and so , in the usual way , we can add @xmath83 to the algebra to obtain the full hopf algebra .",
    "we define @xmath33 to be the space of all monomials containing at least one element of @xmath77 .",
    "it is straightforward to prove the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath33 is a two  sided ideal in @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   @xmath33 is a co  ideal i.e. @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "3 .   @xmath87 .",
    "thus @xmath33 is a two  sided hopf ideal and so we can define a canonical projection from @xmath9 to the quotient space @xmath88 which respects the hopf  algebraic structure ( i.e. the @xmath28relations ) . consequently the quotient is a hopf algebra which we denote @xmath4 .",
    "+ the algebra sector for this quantum group has commutation relations formally obtained from @xmath9 by setting the generator set @xmath89 and this gives rise to the commutation relations explicitly detailed in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath29matrix for the coalgebra is given by @xmath90 which gives the coproduct @xmath91 counit @xmath92 and antipode @xmath93 the quantum determinant @xmath94 is group  like but , since @xmath70 is not central , it can not be made simultaneously central with @xmath66 unless the whole algebraic structure collapses to a trivial extension of the single ",
    "parameter jordanian deformation of @xmath57 .",
    "this is analagous to the situation in the @xmath1deformed case .",
    "+ this procedure also shows that it is possible to view the jordanian quantum plane , @xmath75 , as the quantum homogeneous space @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the hopf algebra formed by appropriately appending the `` dilatation element '' @xmath70 to @xmath5 .",
    "the comultiplication in @xmath4 can then be viewed as a coaction of the quantum group @xmath96 on the quantum plane @xmath75 generated by the elements @xmath72 . however , unlike the usual case , there is a non  trivial braiding between the elements of the quantum group and quantum plane .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to construct the inhomogeneous jordanian deformation @xmath4 as a quotient group by factoring out a hopf ideal from @xmath9 .",
    "it would be of interest to construct the differential calculus on the jordanian quantum plane by a reduction of the bicovariant differential caculus on @xmath9 .",
