    "the origin of the halley - type comets ( htcs ) has been a matter of debate since their orbital properties place them as an `` intermediate '' population between long - period comets ( lpcs ) and jupiter family comets ( jfcs ) . in fig .",
    "[ tisserand ] we show the tisserand parameters with respect to jupiter of the observed populations of old lpcs ( orbital periods @xmath13 yr ) , htcs and jfcs with perihelion distances @xmath2 au as a function of their orbital energies .",
    "we note that the `` energy '' is represented by the variable @xmath7 , since the orbital energy is proportional to the inverse of the semimajor axis @xmath6 .",
    "the tisserand parameters with respect to jupiter of htcs:@xmath14 share the same range as the lpcs , whereas jfcs seem to occupy a different niche with @xmath15 .",
    "+ the inclination distribution of htcs shows a strong predominance of direct orbits , while lpcs show a more or less isotropic distribution of inclinations .",
    "because htcs have shorter orbital periods than lpcs , the former are prone to fall in mean - motion resonances with jupiter , as for instance 1:5 , 1:6 , 1:7 which can help to increase their dynamical stability @xcite .",
    "the dynamical lifetime of htcs is found to be of the order of @xmath16 yr , and collisions with asteroids do not play a significant role in constraining their lifetime @xcite . yet ,",
    "physical processes like sublimation , outbursts and splittings may play a much more fundamental role in setting an upper limit to the comet s lifetime in the near - earth region .",
    "+    it is a well established observational feature that old lpcs are very scarce in the near - earth region , and that they are almost absent for @xmath17 au , in contradiction with what should be expected from dynamical grounds , namely a uniform distribution of orbital energies ( which would imply a large population of old lpcs ) .",
    "this discrepancy has been attributed to fading ( e.g. neslu@xmath18an 2007 ) , a long discussion that goes back at least to @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that most comets during their evolution from new to an old lpc lose material via sublimation , outbursts , fragmentation and their ultimate disruption @xcite . from numerical simulations",
    ", @xcite found that the computed distribution of lpcs could be matched to the observed one by applying a fading law @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of apparitions .",
    "+ lpcs are thought to come from the oort cloud , in a dynamical process in which they change their orbital energy in every perihelion passage in a random way until either they are ejected to interstellar passage , or they become more tightly bound to the sun in orbits of smaller orbital periods @xcite . in this scenario",
    "we may argue that old lpcs , and even the htcs , represent dynamically evolved comets with many perihelion passages by the inner planetary region since their insertion from the oort cloud . describing the orbit evolution of the comet by a random - walk in the energy space , we find that a new comet injected in the near - earth region for the first time will require a few hundred revolutions to reach the old state ( e.g. fernndez 2005 ) . a finite physical lifetime due to sublimation",
    ", outbursts and splittings may account for the predominance of direct orbits , since they require less revolutions to reach a htc orbit @xcite .",
    "according to this view , lpcs and htcs would represent the same dynamical class of comets , being the boundary at @xmath21 yr conventional , since periodic comets with periods shorter than 200 yr have had the chance to be observed more than once .",
    "+ the idea that htcs are captured from the oort cloud and thus represent the end state of the dynamical evolution of lpcs was further developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite among others . from numerical simulations of @xmath22 fictitious oort cloud comets with initial perihelion distances spread between 0 and 31 au , @xcite found that most htcs originate from lpc orbits with @xmath23 au , though they also concluded that oort cloud comets captured in the outer solar system may constitute a significant additional source of htcs .",
    "@xcite also found that htcs can be captured from the classical oort cloud , getting good fits for the inclination and tisserand parameter distributions , and a good agreement with the observed number of comets when physical evolution was included .",
    "the problem is that they used in their simulations an @xcite type algorithm , in which only close encounters with the planets are considered , thus neglecting the weak perturbations from more distant encounters .",
    "the arnold scheme enhances the capture rate into strongly bound orbits ( htcs and short - period orbits ) , so the capture rate from oort cloud comets to htcs could have been overestimated in their model .",
    "+ yet , the view that htcs are the final product of the dynamical evolution of lpcs has been challenged by other authors .",
    "@xcite argued that 1p / halley and other intermediate - period comets on retrograde orbits could have been captured from orbits with perihelia near neptune , semimajor axes @xmath24 au , and inclinations near @xmath25 .",
    "after a close encounter with neptune , there was a perihelion - aphelion exchange , leading to a new retrograde orbit with a small perihelion distance . even though we consider extremely improbable such dynamical mechanism , olsson - steel s idea was interesting in the sense that his source region can be identified in current terms with the scattered disk . from massive integrations of a large number of test particles coming form the oort cloud in isotropic orbits",
    ", @xcite found that they could not reproduce the observed inclination distribution of htcs .",
    "they could obtain a good match if they added an extra disk - like inner cloud to the outer isotropic oort cloud .",
    "later , @xcite reviewed their previous model and concluded that a flattened inner oort cloud can not be a suitable source , since the orbital inclinations will change by galactic tides much faster than the time scale for decreasing their perihelion distances below @xmath26 au where their evolution will continue into htcs .",
    "they suggested instead that the scattered disk will be the dominant source .",
    "again they argued that sdos will be scattered by planetary perturbations to oort cloud distances where galactic tides can drive their perihelia inside the planetary region much faster than the time required to randomize their inclinations and , hence , they can supply a population of mostly low - inclination objets to the htc population .",
    "+ the previous overview tells us that the source region of htcs is still controversial . in order to try to elucidate this issue",
    ", we carry out numerical simulations partly based on the observed sample of old lpcs with @xmath1 au , complemented with simulations with samples of fictitious comets .",
    "our study will be mainly based on comets reaching the near - earth region ( perihelion distances @xmath2 au ) because it is for this region that we have better statistics , and all our comparisons between observed and computed results will be for this range of perihelion distances .",
    "nevertheless , we will also consider the sample of old lpcs with @xmath27 au for which the discovery rate has been greatly improving , mainly in the last fifteen years thanks to different sky surveys .",
    "+ the record of comet apparitions has been very scarce prior to around 1800 , since there were very few experienced observers who could provide an accurate account of the comets sky positions in order to compute good orbits .",
    "the discovery rate increased notoriously during the nineteenth century with the aid of telescopes and , toward the end of the century , the photography . since around mid - nineteenth century",
    ", the discovery rate of comets reaching the earth neighborhood ( perihelion distances @xmath2 au ) has not changed too much , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ discovery ] . +    the distribution of orbital energies of 43 old lpcs discovered in the period 1850 - 2014 ( a time span of 164 yr ) and 29 htcs with @xmath2 au is shown in fig . [ energies ] . for comets with periods @xmath28",
    "yr we have applied a correction factor @xmath29 that takes into account the fraction of comets that still remain unobserved because they have not reached perihelion during the observing window of the last 164 yr .",
    "we can see a steep drop in the number of comets for greater energies , a feature that has been attributed to fading , or other physical effects such as collisions with the sun , the planets or asteroids .",
    "+    the inclination distribution ( in @xmath30 ) for old lpcs and htcs with @xmath2 au show clear departures from randomness ( fig . [ inclinations ] ) , that can be seen for instance in the excess of direct orbits ( more pronounced for htcs ) , and some excess of retrograde comets lying close to the ecliptic plane ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "+    as shown before ( cf . fig .",
    "[ tisserand ] ) , it seems to be a continuation from the lpc population to the htc population in the parametric plane @xmath32 that might suggest a common origin .",
    "by contrast , the jfc population occupies a different niche with a boundary at @xmath33 .",
    "there are a few htcs ( with @xmath34 ) that seem to connect both regions , and the question is whether they come from the same source region as the rest of the htcs and the lpcs .",
    "this question will be addressed in this work .",
    "we consider three samples :    * 43 old lpcs ( orbital periods @xmath0 yr ) discovered between 1850 - 2014 with perihelion distances @xmath2 au .",
    "as said before , we applied a bias correction factor @xmath29 . in general for a given comet of period @xmath35 ( @xmath36 yr ) , a weighting factor @xmath37 was applied , where @xmath38 is a normalization factor to get a number of test objects = 1000 .",
    "we then generate for a given comet @xmath39 of period @xmath40 a number of clones @xmath41 , i.e. the weighting factor rounded to the closest integer .",
    "the clones of a given comet @xmath39 were taken with random energies and perihelion distances within @xmath42% of the energy and perihelion distance of comet @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the orbital angular parameters were taken randomly within @xmath43 degree of the corresponding values for comet @xmath39 . in this way we generated a sample s1 of test objects consisting of 43 original lpcs + 957 clones = 1000 . * 30 old lpcs with the same conditions as before but perihelion distances @xmath44 au . we proceeded as before by applying weighting factors @xmath29 , and multiplying all of them by a normalization factor in order to generate 970 clones with orbital elements obtained in the same way as before .",
    "we will call s2 to this sample of 30 lpcs + 970 clones . *",
    "we also generated a sample s3 of 1000 fictitious comets with initial perihelion distances taken randomly within the interval @xmath45 au , random orientations of their orbital planes , a fixed starting semimajor axis @xmath46 au , and random values for the other angular orbital elements .",
    "the reason why we used here a totally fictitious sample is because of the lack of enough observed old lpcs with perihelia in the region around jupiter s orbit .    in order to check the previous results , we run again the simulations but with three entirely fictitious samples , f1 , f2 , and f3 , of 1000 test bodies each , and chosen within the previously defined @xmath47 ranges , namely : @xmath2 au ( f1 ) , @xmath27 au ( f2 ) , @xmath45 au ( f3 ) .",
    "all the fictitious comets started with a semimajor axis @xmath46 au , random inclinations @xmath48 in the interval @xmath49 , and argument of perihelion @xmath50 and longitude of the ascending node @xmath51 also taken at random within the range @xmath52 . as regards , the perihelion distances , these were taken at random within the three ranges defined above and following the empirical law given by eq.([qcum ] ) to be described below .",
    "+ we also added physical effects to the purely dynamical evolution following the procedure that will be described in section 3.4 .",
    "+ finally , the samples s1 , s2 and s3 were run with nongravitational ( ng ) forces in order to check whether they have any significant influence on the evolution of the comets .",
    "for the radial and transverse components of the ng acceleration we used the following expressions    @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is a function of the heliocentric distance @xmath56 and can be represented by the empirical expression    @xmath57^{-k}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 is a normalization factor such that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 au @xcite . in this analysis",
    "we assume that the normal component @xmath64 .",
    "we used the following input parameters : @xmath65 au day@xmath66 , @xmath67 au day@xmath66 , that are typical for an active lpc .",
    "we were particularly interested in the population of comets that remained or entered the near - earth region ( @xmath2 au ) considering the contribution from the three populations described before . to this purpose we still need to know the relative sizes of the three populations for which it is necessary to estimate how the comet flux varies with the perihelion distance .",
    "+ as mentioned , we considered three comet samples within the ranges of perihelion distances : ( s1 ) @xmath2 au ; ( s2 ) @xmath27 au ; and ( s3 ) @xmath45 au .",
    "if we somehow can define the law @xmath68 , that describes how the cumulative number of old lpcs with perihelion distances @xmath69 varies with @xmath47 , we can then estimate the relative sizes of these three populations .",
    "the law @xmath68 can be estimated from the observed flux of old lpcs .",
    "+ from the inspection of fig .",
    "[ discovery ] we find that 11 old lpcs with @xmath2 au , and other 17 with @xmath27 au passed by their perihelia during the period 2000 - 2014 .",
    "probably the former sample is near complete , while the latter may be still somewhat incomplete because of their larger distances to the sun and the earth .",
    "we may also note that the discovery rate of old lpcs in earth - crossing orbits ( @xmath70 au ) shows little change in the considered period 1850 - 2014 ( suggesting a near complete record ) , and unbiased in @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite found that the great majority of lpcs with @xmath71 yr have absolute total magnitudes @xmath72 ( or diameters @xmath73 km ) .",
    "a check of the total absolute magnitudes of the old lpcs of our sample agrees with the previous observation : it is very rare to find comets fainter than @xmath74 among the old lpcs too .",
    "therefore , we will assume in the following that our lpc sample contains comets brighter than @xmath75 .",
    "fainter comets either disintegrate very fast , or do not exist by cosmogonic reasons , or are too faint to be detected ( see a discussion by fernndez and sosa 2012 ) .",
    "+    we have tested linear fits to the samples of old lpcs described before that are assumed to be near complete .",
    "we have therefore considered the following samples : old lpcs observed during 1850 - 2014 with @xmath70 au ; old lpcs observed during 2000 - 2014 with @xmath1 au ; and the same as before but restricted to @xmath2 au .",
    "the best linear fits are found by taking the square root of the cumulative number of comets with perihelion distances @xmath69 , @xmath76 instead of @xmath68 .",
    "the linear fits for the samples of old lpcs with @xmath70 au discovered during 1850 - 2014 , and those with @xmath1 au discovered during 2000 - 2014 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ qcum_fit ] .",
    "the 1850 - 2014 sample has been corrected by multiplying it by a factor 1.4 that takes into account some missing comets , while the 2000 - 2014 sample has a correction factor that assumes that the probability of discovery of old lpcs , @xmath77 , falls linearly between @xmath78 and @xmath79 au , being @xmath80 for @xmath78 au and @xmath81 for @xmath79 au . from the different tests , we find as the best linear fit    @xmath82    where the best - fitted values for the coefficients are : @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "these coefficients are normalized such that the computed @xmath68 from eq.([qcum ] ) is expressed in units of comets yr@xmath4 that reach perihelion distances @xmath69 .",
    "note that the linear fit is with @xmath85 and not with @xmath86 , and that it is valid for @xmath87 au .",
    "this condition takes into account the observed fact that no old comets are observed coming very close to the sun due to their very short physical lifetime .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath88 and @xmath47 was found to be above 0.94 for all the considered samples .",
    "we will next assume that eq.([qcum ] ) is valid up to @xmath89 au , so we can extrapolate it to get the population of old lpcs reaching jupiter s region .",
    "+ from eq.([qcum ] ) we find : @xmath90 comets yr@xmath4 , @xmath91 comets yr@xmath4 , @xmath92 comets yr@xmath4 .",
    "we thus have the following proportions among the three populations : @xmath93 : @xmath94 : @xmath95 @xmath96 1 : 3.25 : 15 .",
    "we have integrated the massless test bodies under the gravitational potential of the sun and the planets from venus to neptune for 4 myr in the case of the populations with @xmath97 au , and for 10 myr for the sample with @xmath45 au using the code evorb @xcite .",
    "the mass of mercury was added to the sun .",
    "we assumed that a `` collision '' with the sun occurred when the comet reached a perihelion distance smaller than the roche s limit    @xmath98    where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the bulk densities of the sun and the comet , and @xmath101 is the sun s radius .",
    "we assume for the comet nucleus a bulk density @xmath102 g @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "when the test body collides with the sun , or one of the planets , or reaches @xmath104 au is eliminated from the integration . in every perihelion",
    "passage an output with the body s orbital elements is generated in order to follow its orbital evolution through successive perihelion passages .",
    "+ we then generated three files for the purely dynamical evolution of the three samples , considering only gravitational effects , assuming that there are not other losses than ejections and collisions .",
    "we consider first the orbital energy .",
    "the energy distribution histogram of each sample is constructed taken the _ residence time _ as a proxy .",
    "the residence time is computed as follows : when the comet reaches perihelion ( @xmath105 au ) if its osculating energy @xmath106 falls within the range @xmath107 , the residence time will be its orbital period @xmath108 , assuming that @xmath106 does not change during the comet s revolution ( this is in statistical terms a reasonable approximation ) .",
    "note that the residence time within an energy range @xmath109 is expressed in years , and can be understood as the likelihood that a comet will be observed at a certain time within this energy range .",
    "the energy distribution histogram of the considered sample will be then equivalent to the distribution of the sum of the residence times of all the sample comets within energy ranges @xmath109 .",
    "+ in order to obtain the total contribution of the three samples to the near - earth population ( @xmath2 au ) , we combined the three energy - histograms from the samples s1 , s2 and s3 weighting each one of them with a factor that takes into account the estimated proportions of the real populations , namely , sample s1 ( @xmath110 au ) : sample s2 ( @xmath111 au ) : sample s3 ( @xmath112 au ) @xmath113 1 : 3.25 : 15 . + following a similar procedure , we built the inclination and perihelion distance distributions of the samples s1 , s2 and s3 and their combined histograms .",
    "we considered the sublimation lifetime in terms of the number of perihelion passages before its physical disintegration @xmath114 . from thermophysical models",
    "we can derive the sublimation rate and the mass loss @xmath115 per orbital revolution of a water - dominated comet nucleus as done , for instance , by @xcite . these authors could fit a polynomial expression for @xmath115 as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "since the erosion rate per orbital revolution is @xmath116 , the physical lifetime of the comet of radius @xmath117 should be of the order @xmath118 and can also be fitted to a polynomial of @xmath47 .",
    "the polynomial fit , normalized to @xmath119 for @xmath120 au , is found to be    @xmath121    we can normalize to other values of @xmath114 just simply multiplying eq.([nphys ] ) by a scale factor . + we performed the simulation of the physical evolution as follows . from the file containing the whole pure dynamical evolution of each sample ,",
    "as described in the previous section , we read the number of the perihelion passage of each test body and its orbital elements .",
    "we apply physical losses only if @xmath122 au using eq.([nphys ] ) by a monte carlo method .",
    "the procedure was the following : if a test body fulfilled the condition that @xmath122 au at a certain time , we then took a random number @xmath123 in the interval ( 0,1 ) and , if @xmath124 , we assumed that the body was physically destroyed and eliminated from the sample , otherwise we kept it in the simulation .",
    "if a test body survived the passage and have in addition @xmath110 au , we recorded its residence time with energy @xmath106 as explained above .",
    "then we combined the energy distributions of the three histograms from the samples s1 , s2 and s3 weighted by the factors 1 , 3.25 and 15 , as done before for the purely dynamical case .",
    "we thus obtained the energy distribution of the total population of surviving bodies with @xmath110 au for different physical lifetimes .",
    "we have run the simulations with physical losses for different values of @xmath125 revolutions .",
    "+ in a similar way we computed the distributions of @xmath47 and @xmath126 . + we repeated the numerical simulations for the entirely fictitious samples f1 , f2 and f3 , defined in section 3.1 , and computed the distributions of @xmath106 , @xmath126 and @xmath47 for the purely dynamical case and for the different physical lifetimes @xmath127 quoted before .",
    "the dynamical half time of the samples s1 , s2 and s3 are found to be : 0.37 myr , 0.58 myr and 0.75 myr respectively , considering only the purely dynamical evolution . from the initial number of 1000 test bodies for each sample , the number of survivors at the end of the integration were 14 , 32 and 5 for the samples s1 , s2 and s3 respectively . most of the objects are eliminated in hyperbolic orbits but a small percentage ( @xmath128 ) are eliminated by collision with the sun .",
    "collisions with the planets are very rare .",
    "+ a fraction of the comets evolve into more tightly bound orbits where the systematic gravitational effects of the planets become more relevant , in particular , trapping in mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) .",
    "resonances are easily detected because the time evolution of the semimajor axis changes its behavior from erratic to a small amplitude oscillation around a constant mean value @xmath129 . in order to study the relevance of the mmrs , we calculate the mean value of the orbital elements in time intervals of @xmath130 yr using all orbital states from the numerical integrations .",
    "we then construct histograms of @xmath129 with bins of 0.01 au .",
    "these histograms show a distribution of @xmath129 strongly influenced by captures in mmrs with the giant planets , mainly jupiter . in fig .",

    "the general trend of the spikes for semimajor axes greater than 12 ua is in good agreement with strengths of the resonances in that region as can be deduced from @xcite . by comparing the frequency of @xmath129 in the spikes with that in the background ( the bottom black region of fig .",
    "[ resonances ] ) , we find that at least @xmath131 of the orbital evolution of comets reaching semimajor axes @xmath132 au is done inside two - body exterior mmrs with jupiter .",
    "+    most of the objects captured in mmrs are evolving in retrograde orbits , a fact that is consistent with the results showed by @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ mediosia ] ) .",
    "the results obtained here are also consistent with the study of the restricted three - body problem sun - jupiter - comet by @xcite in which he found that stable librations can occur for up to the 1:9 mmr with jupiter ( @xmath133 yr ) for direct low - inclination comets , while stable librations can extend to the 1:21 mmr ( @xmath134 yr ) for retrograde orbits .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the greater or lesser gravitational perturbing influence of jupiter for direct or retrograde orbits @xcite .",
    "the kozai mechanism is the main responsible for large amplitude oscillations in @xmath47 and @xmath126 , specially for particles also captured in mmrs .",

    "this mechanism is responsible for driving many old lpcs and htcs toward the sun , as was originally discussed in depth by @xcite . + as mentioned before , about 4.7% of our computed lpcs end up their evolution colliding with the sun in the purely dynamical case .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that a comet `` collides '' with the sun ( i.e. reaches a perihelion distance @xmath136 au ) after a smooth decrease in its perihelion distance .",
    "we find that the average number of perihelion passages required to decrease the perihelion distance from 0.2 au to 0.0173 au is typically from several hundreds to thousands revolutions ( fig .",

    "other possibility is that some centaurs come from the capture of oort cloud comets in the outer planetary region as discussed by @xcite and @xcite . in the end",

    "+    in order to check the results found for the simulated htcs produced from the evolution of the centaur sample , we also studied the dynamical evolution for 1 myr to the past and to the future of 15 observed htcs with @xmath2 au and energies @xmath182 au@xmath4 ( orbital periods @xmath183 yr ) .",
    "we confirm that htcs do not diffuse randomly in @xmath6 but tend to be captured in the 1:6 exterior resonance with jupiter generating a concentration at @xmath184 au@xmath4 .",
    "this peak is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ htcs ] which is a histogram of frequencies of the average @xmath129 over periods of 500 years .",
    "+ other remarkable feature is that even though we obtain about 4.7% of lpcs that end up colliding with the sun for a purely dynamical evolution , this percentage is practically null when we consider appropriate physical lifetimes ( @xmath149 revolutions ) .",
    "the reason is that lpcs approach the sun in a smooth way through a multi - step process , that takes hundreds to thousands revolutions , so it is very likely that such comets will disintegrate well before reaching sungrazing states .",
    "+ the inclination distribution of the old lpcs shows clear departures from randomness that can be described as a slight predominance of prograde orbits that is somewhat counterbalaced by an excess of near - ecliptic , retrograde comets ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "some predominance of prograde orbits in old lpcs can be explained as a result of dynamical and physical losses of comets random - walking in the energy space @xcite , but why is there an excess of near - ecliptic retrograde orbits ? .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ icent ] ( bottom , right - hand panel ) can provide an explanation to this curious feature .",
    "the evolution of centaurs in the near - earth region generates a population of fake old lpcs near @xmath165 that adds to the bona fide old lpcs from the oort cloud , giving a possible explanation for the observed excess of near - ecliptic retrograde orbits .",
    "+ another important point to analyze is whether the end states of the evolution of lpcs and centaurs produce the correct proportions between htcs and jfcs observed in the near - earth region ( @xmath2 au ) .",
    "remember ( cf .",
    "[ tisserand ] ) that for orbital periods @xmath158 yr most comets are jfc type ( i.e. their tisserand parameters @xmath15 ) , while the opposite occurs for periods @xmath186 yr . the populations of htcs and jfcs in the near - earth region are of comparable size @xcite .",
    "we find that the evolution of lpcs leads to 99.4% of htcs and only 0.6% of jfcs in the case of a purely dynamical evolution .",
    "for a physical lifetime of @xmath159 revolutions , the proportions changes somewhat but not dramatically : there are 95% of htcs and 5% of jfcs .",
    "if we focus on the comets reaching orbital periods @xmath158 yr , the proportions are 86.6% of htcs and 13.4% of jfcs .",
    "we thus conclude that the evolution of lpcs leads to a overwhelming predominance of htcs in comparison with jfcs , which is in contradiction with observations .",
    "+ when we consider the end products of the evolution of centaurs in the near - earth region the results turn out to be quite different .",
    "thus , a purely dynamical evolution leads to 70.1% of htcs and 29.9% of jfcs .",
    "when we only consider those that reach @xmath158 yr , the proportions are 54.6% of htcs and 45.4% of jfcs .",
    "these values are closer to the observed ones , but still not quite consistent .",
    "if we consider now a more realistic case of the evolution of centaurs with a finite physical lifetime ( @xmath164 revolutions ) , the proportions become : htcs ( 36.6% ) and jfcs ( 63.4% ) , if we restrict the analysis to @xmath158 yr , the corresponding values are : htcs ( 16.1% ) and jfcs ( 83.9% ) .",
    "we can see that in this case we can get populations of htcs and jfcs whose sizes are consistent with the observed ones , in particular we can verify that in this case the great majority of comets with periods @xmath158 yr are of jfc type .",
    "we can sum up the main results of our study in the following points :    * the simulated dynamical and physical evolution of old lpcs in the near - earth region can match the observed energy distribution of old lpcs and htcs only up to energies @xmath187 au@xmath4 .",
    "we get too few comets with energies greater than @xmath188 au@xmath4 as compared to the observed distribution , so a source other than lpcs is required to explain their origin . *",
    "the best results for the simulated energy , inclination and perihelion distance distributions are obtained for a physical lifetime of about 200 - 300 revolutions ( for a comet with a standard perihelion distance @xmath120 au ) .",
    "* the observed long tail of near - earth comets with binding energies @xmath9 au@xmath4 ( corresponding to htcs and jfcs ) can be best explained if their immediate source are the centaurs with perihelia close to jupiter s orbit . in particular , we are able to explain the clustering of energies around @xmath189 ( orbital periods @xmath190 yr ) where comets can be trapped in strong mmrs with jupiter , in particular 1:6 and 1:7 . * during the transit to htc orbits , old lpcs are often captured in mmrs with jupiter , in particular in exterior 1:n resonances . for comets in the near - earth region reaching semimajor axes @xmath132",
    "au , we found that al least 12% of the evolution time is spent in any of these resonances . *",
    "a purely dynamical evolution leads to a percentage @xmath191 of lpcs that end up as sungrazers . yet , no sungrazers were obtained when the number of revolutions is limited by a physical lifetime @xmath192 revolutions ( for a standard @xmath120 au ) .",
    "this is because it takes from hundreds to thousands of revolutions for a comet to become a sungrazer , starting from a somewhat more distant orbit ( say , with a perihelion distance @xmath193 au that roughly corresponds to the minimum perihelion distance of observed old lpcs ) .",
    "* the boundary between old lpcs ( coming from the oort cloud ) and htcs ( coming from the scattered disk ) is found to lie at @xmath10 au@xmath4 ( @xmath11 yr ) .",
    "therefore , the traditional limit at @xmath21 yr has no dynamical basis .",
    "as shown , comets with energies 0.03 - 0.04 au@xmath4 ( @xmath194 yr ) may correspond to the end tail of the evolution of old lpcs .",
    "* most of the comets in the near - earth region reaching energies @xmath167 au@xmath4 from the evolution of lpcs are of htc type , even among those with orbital periods @xmath158 yr . therefore , we find a discrepancy not only with the very small number of comets reaching such short periods , but also that most of them are of htc type while the observations show that the great majority are jfcs .",
    "however a centaur source produce populations of htcs and jfcs whose sizes are consistent with observations . * centaurs with perihelia close to jupiter s orbit are thus very likely the immediate source of htcs and jfcs .",
    "it was beyond the scope of this paper to analyze the provenance of the centaurs .",
    "we can argue that most of them come from the scattered disk , being essentially subject to the perturbations of the jovian planets , with a small fraction that attained oort cloud distances during their evolution that allow galactic tides to randomize their orbits ( thus generating a small percentage of centaurs in high - inclination and retrograde orbits ) .",
