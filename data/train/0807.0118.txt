    "light charged particles ( lcp ) evaporated from an excited composite is widely used as a tool to investigate the properties of that composite .",

    "induced reaction the composite system gains low excitation and low angular momentum , while in heavy ion induced reaction the associated angular momentum value is high enough .",
    "the statistical model is used to describe the decay of a highly excited composite .",
    "the energy spectra of light charged particles emitted in light ion induced reaction are explained satisfactorily by the statistical model predictions @xcite .",
    "however , in heavy ion induced reaction , the energy spectra of lcps are inconsistent with the respective theoretical predictions of statistical model because of the angular momentum induced deformation of the hot composite @xcite .",
    "in addition , specific structure effects ( @xmath7 , @xmath1-clustering in @xmath1-like nuclei ) are also known to influence the reaction process and thus contribute to the deformation of the composite .",
    "the @xmath2ne + @xmath3c system has been investigated extensively in recent years @xcite in connection with the study of nuclear orbiting in @xmath1-cluster systems .",
    "as orbiting is associated with large deformation of the composite , the deformations of the hot composites formed in the @xmath2ne + @xmath3c reactions ( in the energy range 7  10 mev / nucleon ) have been estimated from the study of the respective @xmath1-evaporation spectra .",
    "it was found that the deformations of hot composites are much larger than `` normal '' deformation @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to study if the emissions of other light particles are also equally affected by deformation . here",
    ", we report a study on the effect of deformation in the emitted z = 1 particles , such as , triton , deuteron , proton .",
    "very recently , there have been a few attempts @xcite to measure the light charged particles in coincidence with individual evaporation residues to probe the finer details of the reaction meachanism . such studies may enable us to explore the evaporation decay cascade of the composite system .",
    "moreover , the contributions from other non - evaporative ( @xmath7 , fissionlike , pre - equilibrium ) decay channels may also be estimated from such measurement . here , we report an exclusive measurement of light charged particles emitted in coincidence with individual evaporation residues of hot @xmath6s nucleus produced in the @xmath2ne ( 158 mev ) + @xmath3c reaction and",
    "show that such exclusive data may provide important clues to reveal the intricacies of the decay cascade .",

    "the experimental procedures are described in the sec .",
    "the analysis of the data and the results are discussed in sec .",

    "typical solid angles subtended by the telescopes were 0.33 msr , 0.19 msr , 0.74 msr and 0.53 msr , respectively .",
    "the telescopes were calibrated using elastically scattered @xmath2ne ion from au , al and c targets and @xmath12th @xmath1-source .",
    "absolute energy calibrations of the e and @xmath11e detectors for each telescopes were done separately using standard kinematics and energy - loss calculations .",
    "the measured energies have been corrected for the energy losses at the target by incorporating a single average thickness correction for each fragment energy .",
    "the low - energy cutoffs thus obtained were typically @xmath8 3.0 mev for proton and @xmath8 10.2 mev for @xmath1-particles in tli telescopes . in thi telescopes ,",

    "according to statistical model , the probability of different decay paths , through which mg can be populated , decrease in the order [ subeq : a ] , [ subeq : c ]  and  [ subeq : d ] , and [ aa ] .",
    "the @xmath1-particle and proton energy spectra measured in coincidence with the residue na have been displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "the parent nuclei which may populate na through @xmath1-particle emission are @xmath6s , @xmath89s , @xmath89p , @xmath90p , @xmath13al and @xmath95al . the protons may be emitted from @xmath6s , @xmath89s , @xmath93si , @xmath13si , @xmath13al , @xmath95 mg nuclei .",
    "the different decay paths are    @xmath100    from fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] it is evident that the residue na may have been populated predominantly through the sequence [ na1 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "however , for the residue na , [ na1 ] and [ na2 ] ( dash - dotted line ) decay paths have more or less equal probability .",
    "the other decay paths [ na3 ] ( dotted line ) and [ na4 ] ( dashed line ) have nearly same probabilities , which are five times smaller than the earlier two paths ( [ na1 ] and [ na2 ] ) .    therefore , from this analysis it has been found that population of evaporation residue follows a specific decay path ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "in this work , the @xmath2ne + @xmath3c system has been studied at four incident energies , 158 , 170 , 180 , and 200 mev , respectively .",
    "the inclusive energy spectra of proton , deuteron and triton have been measured at different laboratory angles in the range 10@xmath101 to 50@xmath101 .",
    "it was found that the invariant cross - section for protons plotted in @xmath102 plane does not follow the circle centered around compound nucleus velocity .",
    "this indicates the presence of a source which has velocity higher than @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of pre - equilibrium process has been found in the emitted proton spectra at forward angles ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this pre - equilibrium component has been extracted using the moving source model considering two sources , equilibrium source and intermediate velocity source .",
    "the @xmath2ne ( 158 mev ) + @xmath13al reaction has been studied for comparison , and this also shows the presence of pre - equilibrium process .",
    "it has been observed that nuclear deformation affected the energy distributions of different z = 1 particles in different manner .",
    "the proton energy spectra were found to be rather insensitive to nuclear deformation for both the systems ( @xmath2ne + @xmath3c , @xmath13al ) studied here . on the other hand , deuteron and triton energy spectra",
    "could not be explained without the introduction of deformation ; in both cases ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) , it was found that same set of spin dependent deformability parameters ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) which was required to fit the alpha - particle spectra @xcite , can explain the data fairly well .",
    "it is interesting to note here that for protons , though the the energy distributions are rather insensitive to nuclear deformation , proper explanation of the angular distributions of evaporated protons would require the deformation to be incorporated in the calculation , and the magnitudes of the deformation parameters were same as those used for fitting the @xmath5 and @xmath1 energy spectra .",
    "the sensitivity of the statistical model prediction of the energy spectra on level density parameter @xmath40 has also been studied and it was found that the value of @xmath105 generated best fit to the data .    some interesting features in the shapes of the exclusive light charged particle spectra have been observed in the decay of @xmath6s nucleus which may be correlated , at least in a qualitative manner , with the decay sequence of hot composite system . it may be inferred from the @xmath1-particle and proton spectra observed in - coincidence with al that , the decay sequence in this case is first chance @xmath1 emission followed by a proton emission .",
    "similarly , in case of mg , it may be inferred that mg has been populated by sequential emission of @xmath1-particles from @xmath6s nucleus .",
    "in addition , mg may also populate through @xmath97 and @xmath98 emission paths . for na residue",
    ", @xmath106 is the most prominent decay path .",
    "it is thus clear that , the exclusive fragment - light particle data may be used to extract information about the nuclear decay sequence .",
    "however , it is not intuitively evident why some particular decay paths would be favoured against other statistically competitive paths to populate a particular residue .",
    "more detailed exclusive measurements are required to have a concrete idea about the decay sequence .",
    "in addition , refinement of statistical model codes is also needed to tract down the complete decay sequence in more unambiguous manner ."
