    "one of the most widely debated problems in modern astrophysics is related to heating of the hot gaseous environment in galaxy clusters , which is required by the observed temperature and entropy profiles of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "this problem is manifested by the apparent lack of observed low - temperature gas ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the virial temperature ) falling at very high rates ( @xmath10yr@xmath2 ) onto the centers of the so - called `` cooling - flow '' systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although the debate regarding the exact physical processes at work is in this context still ongoing , mechanical heating by relativistic jets and lobes expanding from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) of giant ellipticals located in cluster centers ( hereafter ` brightest cluster galaxies ' , bcgs ) , is considered as one of the most promising scenarios ( see , e.g. , the topical reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this idea is supported by the finding that bcgs are indeed typically radio - loud ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the jets and lobes produced in those systems are , on average , capable of suppressing the dramatic icm cooling as far as the total available energy release is considered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see the discussion below ) .",
    "the impact of large - scale jets and lobes on their environment is not restricted to quenching of cooling flows in clusters .",
    "radio - loud agn are now understood to play a crucial role also in altering the gas properties in galaxy groups ( where , in fact , most of the galaxies in the universe reside ) and isolated massive ellipticals ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , or even to suppress star - formation processes in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of systems in formation ( particularly at high redshifts ) , influencing in this way the co - evolution of galaxies and central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in a complex feedback loop @xcite .",
    "hence , understanding the energetics of agn jets and lobes , as well as how exactly they interact with the ambient medium , is crucial for understanding the structure formation in the universe in general .",
    "the first models of the icm heating by agn jets involved energy dissipation at strong shocks driven in the ambient medium by the expanding jet cocoons , i.e. , lobes @xcite .",
    "such shocks were naturally expected in the framework of widely accepted evolutionary scenarios developed for ` classical doubles ' @xcite .",
    "however , while the cavities in the x - ray emitting cluster gas at the positions of radio lobes of bcg - hosted agn were being discovered already in _ rosat _  data ( see @xcite for perseusa , @xcite for cygnusa , or @xcite for abell4059 ) , indicating clearly that the expanding jets do displace the icm out of the cluster central regions , no radiative signatures for the expected shocks heating up the x - ray emitting gas around the boundaries of the radio lobes were found even in the first high - resolution _ chandra _  observations of systems like hydraa @xcite , perseusa @xcite , abell2052 @xcite , rbs797 @xcite , or abell4059 @xcite .",
    "this absence of evidence for strong shocks at the lobes edges led to the conclusion that the expected supersonic expansion of jet cocoons takes place only in the earliest phases of the source evolution ( basically only when the radio structure is still confined within the ism of the host ) , and is quickly replaced by a transonic expansion as soon as the lobes reach the icm scale @xcite .",
    "this transonic expansion of the lobes , combined with the anticipated duration of the jet lifetime / jet duty cycle of the order of @xmath11myr , which is much shorter than the cluster lifetime , led next to the idea that , after switching off the jet activity , the lobes detach from the central agn and rise buoyantly in the stratified cluster atmosphere in the form of low - density ` bubbles . '",
    "the rising bubbles uplift the cool gas from the center , converting their enthalpy into the gas kinetic energy , which may next be thermalized _ somehow _ in the bubbles wake @xcite .",
    "this scenario seemed supported by the discovery of ` ghost cavities ' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and also by numerical simulations of the jet evolution in rich cluster environment ( e.g. , @xcite ; although one should note that the stability of such structures against various types of magneto - hydrodynamic instabilities , which depends crucially on the hardly known icm magnetic field configuration , is an open issue , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "later , however , the evidence for the presence of _ weak _ shocks driven by expanding lobes in the gaseous atmospheres of clusters , galaxy groups , and isolated systems , started to emerge in deep and very deep _ chandra _  and xmm-_newton _  exposures ( see  [ sh ] below and references therein ) , and placed increased attention back again on the possibility of shock heating of the icm @xcite . yet",
    "highly over - pressured jet cocoons expanding supersonically are expected in luminous classical doubles , i.e. fanaroff - riley type ii sources ( friis ) , rather than in low - power fanaroff - riley type i radio galaxies ( fris ) typically found in the centers of rich clusters ( see in this context * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , a number of observational studies indicated that friis at low redshifts avoid dense cluster environment , and that there is a clear difference in richnesses of clusters harboring fri and friis central radio galaxies _ on average _ , albeit with a substantial dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are however strong indications that this may not hold in the higher-@xmath12 universe , where luminous friis are found also in richer systems , equivalent to abell class i or higher @xcite .    according to @xcite , radio galaxies with total spectral luminosity density",
    "exceeding @xmath13whz@xmath2 are characterized almost exclusively by a ` classical - double ' , edge - brightened morphology , consisting of collimated jets terminating in well - localized bright hotspots , and surrounded by prominent lobes . on the other hand ,",
    "the overwhelming majority of sources with 1.4ghz spectral power below this critical value possess edge - darkened large - scale radio structures with less - collimated jets lacking any clear termination points , but instead extend in a plume - like fashion to larger distances , or form amorphous bubbles of radio - emitting plasma .",
    "these two types of objects are referred to as the aforementioned frii and fri type radio galaxies , respectively .",
    "@xcite later argued that the frii / fri division depends not only on the total radio power of a source , but also on the properties of the galactic hosts , and that the borderline radio luminosity in particular scales with the host optical luminosity as @xmath14 .",
    "later investigations showed however that the @xcite scaling is not an absolute separation , as there is a substantial scatter of friis around the proposed borderline ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "still , even only a rough positive dependance of the jet radiative luminosity on the host luminosity is a strong indication that the difference in large - scale radio morphology of a source is due to a combination of the jet kinetic power ( scaling somehow with the lobes radio luminosity ) and the properties of the ambient medium ( on the galactic scale ) , rather than due to the jet power alone ( see in this context also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "namely , for a given pressure and density of the ambient medium , the jet has to be powerful enough to pierce through the surrounding gas and to form a strong termination shock ( observed as a hotspot ) at the tip of an outflow , through which the jet plasma passes by , back - flowing into an over - pressured cocoon / lobe surrounding the jet ; the lobe expands next sideways with supersonic velocity driving weaker bow - shock all along its edges .",
    "we note that the frii and fri populations seem to differ also in the agn emission line properties whereby sources with prominent emission lines ( ` high - excitation radio galaxies ' ; hergs ) are typically associated with frii - type radio structures , while majority of fri - type sources possess nuclei with no strong emission lines (  low - excitation radio galaxies  ; lergs ; see * ? ? ?",
    "again , the division is not a strict one , since many friis are classified as lergs , and some fris are found to have herg - like nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite this caveat , the established correspondence is in general consistent with the idea that the production of powerful jets  like the ones found in friis  requires higher accretion rates ( evidenced by prominent agn emission lines ) , with the commonly anticipated borderline at the accretion luminosities in eddington units , @xmath15 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this issue is then particularly interesting in the context of bcg - hosted jets , which are often assumed to be powered only by a hot rarefied gas accreting at a limited rate @xcite , even though large amounts of cold gas capable of an efficient fueling of central smbhs are now being routinely found in many giant ellipticals at the centers of evolved clusters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "studying classical doubles in rich cluster environment is therefore important for several reasons , and in particular for understanding ( i ) the agn activity and jet duty cycle in the evolved systems , ( ii ) the evolution of relativistic outflows and their interactions with the ambient medium , as well as ( iii ) the mechanical heating of the icm by the expanding agn jets and lobes .",
    "thus motivated , here we present the analysis of multifrequency data for the frii source pksb1358@xmath0113  located in the center of the abell1836  cluster .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ data ]",
    "we describe the target selection , and present the analysis of the arc - second resolution radio maps from the very large array archive , along with the newly acquired optical spectra from the william herschel telescope , as well as _",
    "chandra _  and xmm-_newton _  x - ray data . in  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the main results of the data analysis for the pksb1358@xmath0113/abell1836  system . in ",
    "[ discuss ] we summarize our findings in a broader context of the ` radio - mode ' feedback operating in galaxy clusters .",
    "we assumed a standard cosmology with @xmath16kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , so that the redshift of the target @xmath19 corresponds to the luminosity distance of 158mpc and the conversion scale of @xmath20kpc/@xmath21 .",
    "as mentioned in  [ intro ] above , powerful radio galaxies of the frii type at low redshifts are typically found in relatively poor groups of galaxies , or even in isolated fields , and those associated with richer environments are located rather at the outskirts of merging systems ( like for example 3c353 in the zw1718.1@xmath00108 cluster studied in detail with _",
    "chandra _  and xmm-_newton _  by @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "there are only a few well - studied exceptions from this rule , including the famous cygnusa radio galaxy ( see  [ sh ] below and references therein ) . to search for more ` cygnusa - type ' cluster radio sources , we examined the results of the nrao very large array ( _ vla _ ) imaging survey of abell clusters carried out by f.n .",
    "owen and collaborators @xcite .",
    "we identified 12 radio galaxies displaying frii type morphology in their sample of @xmath22 clusters at @xmath23 .",
    "most of these display large offsets from the cluster centers ( 3@xmath248@xmath24 ) , as expected , and only two are clearly hosted by the brightest cluster galaxies : 4c+67.13 in abell578 ( @xmath25 , richness @xmath26 ) , and pksb1358@xmath0113  in abell1836  ( @xmath19 , @xmath27 ) .",

    "the pksb1358@xmath0113/abell1836  system discussed in this paper may constitute an important addendum to the above list , with its @xmath214 shock driven at @xmath191kpc distances from the cluster center by the expanding frii - type lobes inflated for about @xmath175myrs by jets with kinetic luminosity @xmath173ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the bulk of the total energy transported by these jets , @xmath215ergs , is deposited into the shock - heated surrounding thermal gas and the internal energy of the jet cavity ; only a negligible fraction of @xmath216 is radiated away via non - thermal processes at radio and x - ray frequencies .",
    "the mach number of the bow shock claimed above is relatively high , keeping in mind the other shocks found so far in clusters of galaxies , although one should emphasize here that abell1836  is a relatively poor system with low gas density and temperature .",
    "let us therefore comment in this context on the fact that while the presence of plasma discontinuities in poorer environments were inferred through analysis of temperature and surface brightness profiles of the x - ray emitting plasma , the corresponding shock mach numbers were estimated in several cases based solely on the derived temperature enhancements , under the working assumption that these correspond precisely to the temperature jumps following from the macroscopic rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for an ideal gas .",
    "yet the ` observed ' temperature jumps follow from the analysis of the thermal electron emission ( bremsstrahlung ) continua , and as such , reflect the electron temperatures rather than temperatures of the dynamically dominating ions .",
    "this distinction may be of importance , since the electron heating at non - relativistic collisionless shocks is still an open problem , as it is controlled by hardly understood microscopic processes involving a variety of plasma instabilities operating at and around shock fronts .",
    "these various processes may proceed differently in different types of shocks , depending on the upstream plasma parameters . interestingly , _ in situ _ observations of low- and intermediate-@xmath184 collisionless shocks in the solar system indicate that the fraction of the dissipated energy that goes into thermal electron heating decreases with increasing shock mach number @xcite .",
    "let us therefore speculate that the thermal electron heating at bow shocks driven by the expanding agn jets and lobes in clusters and groups of galaxies is similarly inefficient , with an analogous inverse dependence on the shock mach number . if true , this would then create _ an additional bias against detecting stronger shocks in poorer environments_. the gas density here comes into play because even in the case of inefficient electron heating at the shock , the electron - ion temperature equilibration due to coulomb collisions is inevitable in the downstream .",
    "the related timescale for this process is @xmath217 which , for the @xmath218kev temperature electron gas with number density @xmath219@xmath126 ( i.e. , for the parameters of the icm in abell1836  upstream of the shock ) , reads as @xmath220myr .",
    "this timescale is longer than the lifetime of the radio source pksb1358@xmath0113  ( @xmath118myr ) , which may imply that the electron and ion temperatures in the shocked icm did not yet equilibrate fully . on the other hand , in cases of environments denser than that of abell1836  ( e.g. , m87 ) or in radio galaxies more evolved than pksb1358@xmath0113  ( e.g. , hydraa ) , the temperature equilibration due to electron - ion coulomb collisions in the downstream may proceed faster , or at least sufficiently fast , to assure @xmath221 , so that the discussed effect is not important .    if , however , the parameters of a system are such that @xmath222 ( which we expect to happen in the cases of younger radio galaxies evolving in poorer environments ) , _ and _ the collective plasma processes responsible for the electron heating at the shock front are indeed inefficient , as hypothesized here , then relatively strong shocks driven by the expanding lobes may appear ` weaker ' on the temperature maps when compared with the density maps ( see in this context the case of the frii radio galaxy 3c444 evolving in the abell3847 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one should emphasize here that the detection of weak shocks in lower - density environments is in general difficult , as the resulting surface brightness enhancement are expected to be rather minor . in addition , the broad band response of the available x - ray detectors is more sensitive to the gas density rather than temperature , which makes temperature jumps rather unreliable proxies for shock mach numbers ( especially taking into account in addition the effects of projection of curved shock fronts onto the sky ) .",
    "still , the analysis of the temperature maps may in many cases be the only method available for this purpose , in particular in the cases of stronger shocks for which the density jump is not very sensitive to @xmath184 and saturates quickly at the asymptotic value of @xmath223 ( see figure[f - sh ] ) .",
    "the other complication in this respect may be however an increased efficiency of the fermi - type acceleration of suprathermal electrons with the increasing shock mach number ( see in this context the recent discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the derived @xmath229 is likely lower than the bondi value , which we could only restrict to a relatively wide range ( @xmath230yr@xmath2@xmath152yr@xmath2 ) because the accretion radius is not resolved in our _ chandra _  observation .",
