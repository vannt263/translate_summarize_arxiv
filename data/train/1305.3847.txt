    "proton is the particle which makes up the greatest fraction of the matter in the visible universe and its properties have been extensively studied .",
    "nevertheless it still holds some mysteries , among them the physical origin of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , right behind the more fundamental electromagnetic properties of the proton as are the electric charge and magnetic moment .",
    "experiments have been done since the 60 s to characterize and measure the electromagnetic properties of the proton using fixed - target compton scattering @xcite . in the recent two decades ,",
    "high quality proton compton scattering data in the first @xmath5(1232mev ) resonance region have been obtained at saskatchewan @xcite , by legs collaboration @xcite and at mainz mami @xcite . also , in the higher energy region where some recent good data is available due to the hall a collaboration at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "these most recent and precise experiments have determined the static values of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , see for example @xcite , particularly the sign and value of the magnetic polarizability which for a long time remained shrouded in uncertainty , but see @xcite for a new proposal for additional experiments on this . also , high precision value was obtained for the spin - polarizability @xcite which appears in the expansion of the scattering amplitudes to the third order in momentum .",
    "experimentally , it is certainly also possible to measure polarization asymmetries as a function of angle and energy , for example in the last experiment done at the venerable yerevan accelerator @xcite and in the first resonance region by the legs collaboration @xcite .",
    "these data can well be used to discriminate any theoretical model as a strong cross - check , once the basic parameters of the model have been well - determined .    the process in the photon low energy range up to 140 mev is dominated by contributions due to the anomalous magnetic moment as well as the polarizabilities of the nucleon . of these additional contributions ,",
    "anomalous magnetic moments contribute to the amplitude already at the linear order while polarizability starts out at the second order , thus cross - section can grow at first quadratically and then quartically with energy .",
    "this is in contrast to the minimal coupling in qed , where the klein - nishina cross - section is essentially constant in the relevant energy range .",
    "fundamental results on scattering of light on particles of spin 1/2 with anomalous magnetic moment were obtained by powell , low , gell - mann and goldberger , @xcite .",
    "early theoretical progress was driven by the phenomenologically very successful dispersion theory approach @xcite , see also the latest excellent review in @xcite .",
    "this approach was supplemented by insights gained from considering pion - vertex corrections and a multitude of other improvements such as those in @xcite .    on the other hand , within the purely field - theoretic chiral - lagrangian paradigm @xcite",
    ", the development of the promising approach of peccei @xcite was held up by difficulties in the field theory of the spin 3/2 @xmath0 particle .",
    "the most egregious of these pathologies had been resolved in @xcite .",
    "this better understanding of the theoretical requirements on the @xmath5 propagator led to the paper of pascalutsa and scholten @xcite in which the first workable field - theoretical model for proton compton scattering which incorporated the contribution of the resonance was constructed .",
    "there , it was argued that the virtual spin 1/2 degrees of freedom present in the standard propagator do play a role in the compton scattering amplitude .",
    "as we shall see , the present work s approach most directly descends from this model of pascalutsa and scholten and the subsequent recent developments in @xcite .",
    "a separate development was the proposal to rid the theory of spin 3/2 particles of pathologies that stem from superluminal solutions by ranada and sierra in @xcite .",
    "there , it was found that taking a rarita - schwinger multiplet of a physical spin 3/2 and a physical spin 1/2 particle ( of different mass ) , would result in an acceptable wave equation even when minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field . a detailed investigation of the structure of poles in the propagator revealed that additional restrictions on the ranada and sierra equations result in a unitary theory with positive definite residues at the feynman poles , taking into account the location of the pole above or below the real axis @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we make use of the propagator of @xcite , in combination with the observation of pascalutsa and scholten that the spin 1/2 degrees of freedom may be due to another baryon , and propose a model where this spin 1/2 mode is interpreted as the proton , such that the proton and the @xmath5 are together described by a single multi - component wave function of rarita - schwinger .",
    "@xmath0 has the same quark constitution ( uud ) as the proton and is only slightly , less than 300mev heavier than the proton .",
    "the only difference between the @xmath0 and proton is the alignment of the spins of these quarks . in the proton ,",
    "the d - quark spin is anti - aligned and makes the total proton spin @xmath6 , while in @xmath0 all three quarks are aligned , making @xmath0 spin @xmath7 .",
    "this makes it very natural to consider the possibility of a unified description , see section [ sec : lagr ] for the lagrangian and more details .",
    "this hypothesis confers several benefits .",
    "low energy proton compton scattering occurs mainly through the proton and @xmath0 in the s- and u- channel and exchange of pions in the t - channel , see fig .",
    "@xmath8 , the lightest baryon resonance , appears in intermediate state .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 is only slightly heavier than the proton , so that this contribution is not suppressed even at the lowest energies compared with the exchange of the proton alone . in our model , because of the unified description , the s / u - channel proton and @xmath0 contributions can be calculated simultaneously as in fig .",

    "the @xmath9 meson is exchanged .",
    "( d ) is the diagram for the contact interaction in ( [ polefflag ] ) . for appropriate photon incident energy ,",
    "the intermediate @xmath0 is approximately on - shell , and around this energy , there is the characteristic peak in the cross - section which is dominated by the @xmath0 contribution .",
    ", width=377,height=188 ]    the second benefit is that in this model it is possible to avoid the introduction of a large number of arbitrary parameters . in section [ sec : nonmin ] ( see also @xcite ) , we present in detail the five electromagnetic form - factors which are possible for a spin 3/2 particle , these couple the momentum - independent fermion bilinears directly to the em field strength .",
    "three of these have clear physical interpretation as the magnetic moments of the proton and the @xmath0 , and the strength of the m1 magnetic transition between @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "one of the remaining two parameters contributes a purely imaginary part to some amplitudes and this is disfavored by data , so that it can be safely set to zero ( see section [ sec : fit ] ) .    in section [ sec : emquantity ] , we discuss the n - n , @xmath0-@xmath0 , n-@xmath0 transition matrices and derive the formulae of the proton and @xmath0 magnetic moments . in section [ sec : crosssec ] , we calculate proton compton scattering cross section and express electric and magnetic polarizabilites in terms of the coefficients of the non minimal interactions , and also analyze the behavior of the amplitudes around the @xmath0 pole .",
    "we fit the compton scattering data in section [ sec : fit ] , and extract polarizabilities using expressions derived in section [ sec : crosssec ] .",
    "since one linear combination of the coefficients of the non minimal interactions gives the @xmath0 magnetic moment , our best - fit parameter set also provides a prediction of the @xmath0 magnetic moment , but we conservatively interpret it as an upper bound . the interactions in section [ sec : nonmin ] can also be used to calculate the @xmath11 decay process ( appendix [ sec : decayamp ] ) , this acts as a useful cross - check on our model .",

    "we identify the spin 3/2 and 1/2 component as @xmath0 and proton respectively and thus unify them in one theory .",
    "this unification is very natural since proton and @xmath0 have the same quark constituents and can transform from one into the other by absorbing or emitting a photon or even a neutral pion ( which carries no charge or spin ) . the mass splitting between the @xmath10 and @xmath5 is less than 300 mev .",

    "for phenomenological application to proton compton scattering , minimal interaction alone does not suffice .",

    "we use only the mami(2001 ) experiment @xcite , which contains 436 data points with photon incident energy ranging from 260mev to 455mev .",
    "a good fit is achieved at @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath99 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "it is notable that @xmath93 , @xmath54 , @xmath21 and @xmath68 have not changed much from the complete fit of all data points , yet @xmath106 per datapoint is much smaller .",
    "this may be indicative of the fact that experimental data prior to this latest and more precise measurements may not be consistent with each other . in the past , one of the strategies for dealing with this has been to allow rescaling the crosssection data for each experiment within the systematical uncertainty which tends to be large @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the sigma channel and/or variation of the mass and width of the sigma meson do not appreciably alter the picture or the values of the best - fit parameters .    in fig.[chisqu ] , we give the contour plots of @xmath106 with respect to several pairs of parameters for this fit .",
    "it is seen that @xmath68 is very strictly constrained .",
    "we then use these values for @xmath93 , @xmath54 , @xmath21 and @xmath68 to fit the low energy data points , varying only @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we take 68 data points with photon incident energy below 140mev and obtain the best fit values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "[ lowangleplot ] and [ lowenergyplot ] . at these values ,",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath128 , much closer to values extracted ( from the same data ) previously .",
    "the first error is determined from the mami fit , by investigating how the contribution of @xmath93 , @xmath68 and @xmath21 to the polarizabilities varies in the 3-dimensional 95% confidence region spanned by these three parameters .",
    "the second error is from the low energy fit .",
    "@xmath129    @xmath130",
    "our model incorporates both minimal and non - minimal couplings .",
    "the former takes into account that the @xmath0 is charged .",
    "the presence of the non - minimal couplings makes the description necessarily complicated , nevertheless the number of free parameters has been kept low .",
    "the parameters have clear physical interpretation , namely as the proton and @xmath0 magnetic moment , as well as the strength of the @xmath131 magnetic transition ( m1 ) and the two bare polarizabilities .",
    "we found that the data near the peak is well fit with our preferred set of parameters in the resonance region , but that the same set of parameters does not well describe the data at low energy .",
    "we have dealt with this in manner similar to @xcite .",
    "although we have been able to extract a value for the @xmath0 magnetic moment , we can not have high confidence in this value since proton compton scattering does not probe the @xmath132 vertex directly .",
    "the reason that this is possible at all is that the form factors have definite properties under lorentz transformations , so that some linear combination of parameters which affects the compton process also determines the magnetic moment of the @xmath0 .",
    "qualitatively , we found that changes in the @xmath56 affect the predicted cross - secion asymmetrically : lower values of the magnetic moment do not drastically change the prediction , but higher values greatly enhance the crosssection , both on and off the resonance .",
    "therefore , our result conservatively stated is that we exclude any values of the @xmath0 magnetic moment @xmath56 larger than about @xmath133 .",
    "this should be compared to that extracted by mami @xcite at @xmath134 , but note that the quoted error is dominated by theoretical model uncertainty .",
    "our upper bound is also consistent with naive quark model expectations and some model calculations @xcite .",
    "the more reliable path towards determining the @xmath0 magnetic moment would be to extend the model to include pion form - factors and thus cover the case of @xmath135 scattering which was also very well measured by some of the very same experimental groups as the compton data considered in the present work .",
    "the authors would like to thank g. georgiou and j.d .",
    "vergados for their valuable comments .",
    "a project funded by the priority academic program development of jiangsu higher education institutions ( papd ) .",
    "aside from proton compton scattering , another process can be readily accounted for in this unified @xmath136 electromagnetic theory , that is the decay @xmath11 .",
    "the feynman rules for this diagram were given in section [ sec : min ] .",
    "we label the momentum and polarization of @xmath0 as @xmath137 , the produced photon @xmath70,@xmath138 and the proton @xmath72,@xmath139 , the matrix element is :    _ _",
    "1,_2,_3=e  |u_2(k_3,_3 )  ^  u_4(k_1,_1 )  _ ^*(k_2 , _ 2 ) .",

    "<S> we develop a field - theoretic model for the description of proton compton scattering in which the proton and its excited state , the @xmath0 resonance , are described as part of one multiplet with a single rarita - schwinger wavefunction . in order to describe the phenomena observed , it is necessary to incorporate both minimal and non - minimal couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal coupling reflects the fact that the @xmath0 is a charged particle , and in this model the minimal coupling contributes also to the @xmath1 magnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> the non - minimal couplings consist of five electromagnetic form - factors , which are accessed at fixed and vanishing momentum - transfer squared with real photons in compton scattering experiments , therefore it is possible to extract a rather well - determined set of optimal parameters which reasonably well fit the data in the resonance region 140 - 450 mev . the crucial parameter which determines the @xmath2 transition amplitude and therefore the height of the resonance peak is equal to @xmath3 , in units of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this parameter also primarily determines the contributions to magnetic polarizability in this model . in the low - energy region up to 140 mev , we separately fit the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , while keeping the other parameters fixed and obtain values in line with previous approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the basic model is then extended with insights gained in the traditional approaches , namely incorporating the sigma - meson channel with the currently favored parameters , and the pion vertex corrections . </S>"
