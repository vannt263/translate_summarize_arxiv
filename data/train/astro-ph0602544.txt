    "solar and stellar magnetic fields are believed to originate in a dynamo , driven by the joint action of the mean hydrodynamic helicity of turbulent convection and differential rotation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the differential rotation of the sun is caused by an anisotropic eddy viscosity which was described phenomenologically in @xcite .",
    "theory of the differential rotation based on the idea of the anisotropic eddy viscosity was developed in a number of papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , there is an additional effect which can strongly modify the differential rotation . in particular",
    ", the direct effect of the turbulent heat flux on the reynolds stresses in a rotating turbulent convection is crucial for formation of the differential rotation .",
    "the effect of rotation on a hydrodynamic turbulence was studied in numerous papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", a relation to the turbulent convection was made in previous theories of the differential rotation only phenomenologically , using the equation @xmath4 which follows from the mixing - length theory .",
    "here @xmath5 is the vertical turbulent heat flux , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are fluctuations of fluid velocity and entropy , @xmath8 is the acceleration of gravity and @xmath9 is the characteristic correlation time of turbulent velocity field .",
    "equation  ( [ a6 ] ) implies that the vertical turbulent heat flux plays a role of a stirring force for the turbulence .",
    "however , a more sophisticated approach implies a solution of a coupled system of dynamical equations which includes the equations for the reynolds stresses @xmath10 , the turbulent heat flux @xmath11 and the entropy fluctuations @xmath12 in a rotating turbulent convection .",
    "the latter has not been taken into account in the previous theories of the differential rotation .",
    "the goal of this study is to analyze the effect of the turbulent heat flux on the reynolds stresses in a rotating turbulent convection and on formation of the differential rotation .",
    "we demonstrated that this effect is crucial for the formation of the differential rotation , and it should be taken into account in theories of the differential rotation of the sun , stars and planets .",
    "in particular , we found that the ratio of the contributions to the reynolds stresses caused by the turbulent heat flux and the anisotropic eddy viscosity is of the order of @xmath13 for @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is the maximum scale of turbulent motions ( the integral scale of turbulence ) , @xmath15 is the rotation rate , @xmath3 is the fluid density variation scale , i.e. , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the fluid density and @xmath18 is the unit vector in the direction of the fluid density inhomogeneity .",
    "the turbulent heat flux contribution to the reynolds stresses changes its sign when the direction of the vertical turbulent heat flux changes .",
    "this is the key difference from previous theories of the differential rotation .",
    "the effect of the turbulent heat flux on the reynolds stresses in a turbulent convection may cause the differential rotation which is comparable with the typical differential rotation of the sun .",
    "the data of the solar differential rotation is obtained from surface observations of the solar angular velocity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and from helioseismology based on measurements of the frequency of @xmath19-mode oscillations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of the differential rotation that is associated with the effect of the turbulent heat flux on reynolds stresses in a rotating turbulent convection is as follows .",
    "let us split the total rotation of fluid into a constant component @xmath15 ( uniform rotation ) and the differential rotation @xmath20 .",
    "the uniform rotation causes the counter - rotation turbulent heat flux ( i.e. , the toroidal turbulent heat flux , @xmath21 , directed opposite to the background rotation @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , there is a correlation of fluctuations of the entropy @xmath7 and the toroidal component of the velocity , @xmath22 .",
    "here @xmath23 are the spherical coordinates .",
    "the counter - rotation turbulent heat flux is similar to the counter - wind turbulent heat flux ( in the direction opposite to the mean wind ) which is well - known in the atmospheric physics .",
    "the counter - rotation turbulent heat flux arises by the following reason . in turbulent convection",
    "an ascending fluid element has larger temperature then that of surrounding fluid and smaller toroidal fluid velocity , while a descending fluid element has smaller temperature and larger toroidal fluid velocity .",
    "this causes the turbulent heat flux in the direction opposite to the toroidal mean fluid flow ( i.e. , opposite to rotation ) .",
    "the counter - rotation turbulent heat flux is determined by eq .",
    "( [ rb30 ] ) in section iii .",
    "the entropy fluctuations cause fluctuations of the buoyancy force , and this results in increase fluctuations of the vertical and meridional components of the velocity which are correlated with the fluctuations of the toroidal component of the velocity .",
    "these produce the off - diagonal components of the reynolds stress tensor , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and create the toroidal component of the effective force which causes formation of the differential rotation @xmath20 in turbulent convection .",
