    "studies of neutral atomic hydrogen ( ) in nearby galaxies using synthesis instruments such as the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , the very large array ( vla ) , australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and more recently the giant metre  wave radio telescope ( gmrt ) have shown the frothy structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "filamentary structures characterize the gas distribution of the galaxy and nearby galaxies and have been referred to as the `` cosmic bubble bath '' @xcite or the `` violent interstellar medium '' @xcite . particularly striking are elliptical features representing a deficiency of interstellar matter , usually bordered by neutral or ionized regions of higher density .",
    "these have been described as bubbles and shells , based on their appearance at different wavelengths .",
    "these structures were first recognised as such in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) by @xcite and in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by @xcite .",
    "the explanation put forward at the time was that these shells were the result of `` super supernovae '' . in our own galaxy ,",
    "there has long been evidence for shell - like structures .",
    "@xcite lists a number of early observations of expanding supershells in the milky way . as he emphasized  identification of shells",
    "is a somewhat subjective process due to the fact that some shells are detected at only one velocity and for those shells that do change as a function of velocity usually only one hemisphere of the shell is observed \" . in addition , distances to these shells are very uncertain , which shifted the focus to nearby galaxies .",
    "so far , of order a dozen galaxies have been observed at spatial and velocity resolutions adequate to map and analyse holes .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tbl - stu ] .",
    "following @xcite and references therein , bubbles and shells are assumed to be created by single stars , as a result of the combined effects of a stellar wind followed by the star exploding as a supernova .",
    "superbubbles and supergiant shells require multiple stars or some other mechanism for their formation .",
    "since bubbles and shells appear as holes in maps of neutral hydrogen , we will be using this term throughout this paper .",
    "as mentioned , stellar winds and supernovae from young massive stars in ob associations and super star clusters ( sscs ) are considered the main driving forces behind the creation of holes and shells whose radii can reach up to hundreds of parsecs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations and analysis of four nearby disk galaxies by @xcite has shown that h@xmath5 shells in giant regions are the likely progenitors of neutral hydrogen shells .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that holes in holmbergii could in principle be the result of stellar feedback from multiple sf episodes , even though similar stellar populations were also found in regions where no holes were detected .",
    "however , a one to one correlation between holes and active star forming regions such as ob associations has not been established as yet .",
    "moreover numerical models by @xcite suggest that the h@xmath5 shells studied by @xcite can not evolve into the largest shells observed unless a physical mechanism other than supernovae ( sne ) is invoked .",
    "the kinetic energies inferred on the basis of the typical expansion velocities measured ( of order a few tens of kms@xmath6 ) range from 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath8 erg .",
    "one of the problems of this  standard \" theory of mechanical input is the existence of a growth - rate discrepancy .",
    "observations show that shells are smaller than what is predicted by theory .",
    "@xcite suggests that this discrepancy can be attributed to one , or a combination of , the following reasons : an overestimate of the input power , an underestimate of the ambient density and/or pressure , enhanced radiative cooling in the interior of the bubbles , or the transfer of mechanical energy from the holes to cosmic rays through the strong mhd turbulence and magnetic fields that govern their interior .    because of a failing consensus on the hypothesis that star clusters power supergiant shells , several alternative explanations have been put forward to explain structures which are found in environments where star formation is suppressed or for those cases for which the energy requirement to create the structure is believed to far surpass what can be delivered by even a super star cluster ( ssc ) . among the mechanisms proposed are infall of high velocity clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ram pressure enlarging embryonic shells @xcite , and turbulence , coupled with cooling and gravitational instability @xcite . at one time",
    "even gamma - ray bursts have been invoked ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the study of shells and supershells is relevant to many areas of galaxy research .",
    "supergiant shells are linked to superbubble blow out and might lie at the origin of a galactic fountain @xcite .",
    "if shells do indeed break out of the disk , the halo or in extreme cases even the intergalactic medium can be enriched by metals produced in the massive stars before they exploded as sne @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations and modeling suggest that actively star forming dwarf irregular galaxies are most prone to mass loss @xcite . given that in the currently accepted @xmath9cdm cosmology dwarf galaxies dominated at large look  back times , this could explain the rapid enrichment and mixing of heavy elements shortly after the first galaxies were formed .",
    "on more local scales , holes play an important role in the evolution of the ism and are ultimately linked to the process of star formation .",
    "expanding holes compress their surrounding medium leading to conditions conducive to star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "examples for this can be found in the lmc where co observations point to the presence of molecular clouds on the rims of several supergiant shells @xcite .",
    "the magellanic clouds are not the only example .",
    "@xcite show similar such accumulations of molecular gas on the interface between two neighbouring shells in ic10 which seemingly are running into each other .",
    "in other words , shells could be driving self  regulating ( propagating or stochastic ) star formation @xcite . on yet smaller scales , the processes leading to shells and supergiant shells provide energy input on the largest turbulent scales which then cascade down to ever smaller scales . and finally , the energy input from sne in the form of expanding shells provides positive feedback as it raises the velocity dispersion in the gas , shutting off further star formation until such time as the gas has cooled down , in a dynamical sense , allowing sf to recommence . on a global scale , the star formation rate in disk galaxies is then controlled by the porosity of the ism @xcite .",
    "this implies a feedback loop which likely causes the ism to have a one dimensional velocity dispersion of 610 kms@xmath6 irrespective of galaxy type @xcite .",

    "in order to derive some of the properties of the holes the scale height of the layer needs to be known . in an isothermal disk the scale height z is given by : @xmath80 @xcite where @xmath81 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath82 the total mass surface density .",
    "however , the disk of a galaxy consists of different components , stars and gas , which have different velocity dispersions i.e matter is not isothermal .",
    "in such a case where the gas is affected by the gravitational potential of the stars and its own self - gravity , its velocity dispersion is given by : @xmath83 @xcite where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the scale heights of gas and stars respectively .",
    "the 1@xmath86 line of sight velocity dispersion of the gas was calculated by taking the fwhm of spectra in quiescent regions of the galaxy and was found to be of order @xmath87 kms@xmath6 consistent with what was found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopted a constant velocity dispersion for the gas for each of our targets .",
    "for @xmath85 we used @xmath88 following @xcite , where @xmath89 is the disk scale length .",

    "the total mass surface density was taken as the sum of the stars and gas ( and h@xmath90 ) mass surface densities @xcite .",
    "the gas surface density is corrected to account for helium and metals . for the stars we used the @xmath91 surface brightness profile which traces the older stars and consequently the bulk of the star mass . in regular spirals ,",
    "the effect of the dark matter halo on the scale height of the gas can be ignored to first order , because its effective contribution to the mass surface density within the typical radii dealt with is insignificant compared to that of baryonic matter .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of dwarf galaxies the influence on scale height of the dark matter distribution becomes significant . in that case",
    "the approach by @xcite would need to be replaced by a more sophisticated approach , such as the one proposed by @xcite .",
    "the mass surface density decreases with radius , initially exponentially as it follows the light and gradually flattening well beyond r@xmath92 where hi dominates .",
    "the observed almost constant velocity dispersion of the gas combined with a radial decline in mass surface density implies that the gas layer flares , i.e. , the scale height increases with radius .",
    "this is confirmed by observations of the milky way @xcite and nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "we therefore decided to use a radially dependent mass surface density to explicitly give radially dependent values for the scale height ; an average value would introduce large uncertainties in the inner and outer parts of a galaxy .",

    "it is clear that in the majority of objects the scale height increases exponentially with radius and the best fit function has the form : @xmath95 in dwarf galaxies the average exponent _ a _ is @xmath96 , in early - type spirals is @xmath97 and in late - type spirals it is @xmath98 . at @xmath99",
    "the scale height tends to flatten to some asymptotic value as the gas and dark matter dominate the matter distribution and therefore we decided to extrapolate using a logarithmic function .",
    "this extrapolation only affects 3 galaxies ( ngc2403 , ngc4449 and ngc4736 ) with a small number of holes .",
    "the method described appears to underestimate the scale height in the inner part of spiral galaxies by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "this can be understood as the velocity dispersion is dependent on radius as well ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion tends to be higher in the inner disk due to the higher star formation and supernova rate .",
    "there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding this finding , a full analysis of which is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the task kpvslice was also extensively used as it offers many ways to look at a data cube by producing interactive position - velocity ( _ pv _ ) cuts in any orientation through a data cube .",

    "first , the task kvis was used to inspect the natural weighted integrated map for the most obvious , more extended structures .",
    "the second step was to search the higher resolution robust weighted integrated map for smaller holes .",
    "from these two steps we generated a list of candidate holes .",
    "the task kvis was then used to inspect the natural weighted and robust weighted data cubes by displaying the channel maps sequentially , much like a movie .",
    "this was done for two reasons : although some of the holes are clearly visible in the integrated maps , many holes do not show up at all due , for example , to the inclination of the galaxy which means that holes along the line of sight tend to blend , or are `` filled in '' with emission at other velocities .",
    "also , holes which are still fully contained within the disk can only be reliably detected in channel maps or _",
    "pv _ diagrams . the second reason to display the channel maps as a movie was to discard holes that are chance superpositions of structures , such as parts of spiral arms , rather than genuine holes in the ism . in order to set standard criteria to classify a feature as a genuine hole",
    ", we decided that a hole should be visible over at least 3 or 5 channels ( depending on whether the velocity resolution is 5.2 or 2.6 kms@xmath6 , respectively ) , which is of order the full width at half maximum corresponding to the typical velocity dispersion encountered .",

    "the hole must be present in at least 3 or 5 consecutive channel maps depending on whether the velocity resolution is 5.2 or 2.6 kms@xmath6 , respectively , 2 .",
    "the center of the hole must remain stationary across the channel maps in which it is observed , 3",
    ".   there must be sufficient contrast ( at least a 50% drop in surface brightness ) between the hole and its immediate surroundings , 4 .",
    "the shape of the hole in position - velocity space must be clearly defined and adequately described by an ellipse .",
    "overall we detected more than 4000 candidate holes across the 20 galaxies .",
    "we decided to stay on the conservative side and only keep holes detected at high significance , i.e. above a certain threshold .",

    "the absence of small diameter holes in , e.g. ngc2841 , ngc3521 and ngc3184 is due to their larger relative distance which sets a lower limit to the linear resolution .",
    "we therefore add a vertical dotted line to indicate the resolution limit for each galaxy .",
    "also there are other factors influencing the detection of holes such as the signal to noise ratio , and the inclination of the object under study ( e.g. ngc2841 and ngc3521 ) .",

    "the kinetic age distributions are similar to those of the diameters of the holes which is to be expected since the kinetic age is derived from the diameter and the expansion velocity which , across the targets , has a small range .",
    "m81 ( ngc3031 ) shows a quite striking distribution . as mentioned in the previous paragraph , this galaxy predominantly has small holes .",
    "their ages are all below 40 myr .",
    "one possible explanation is that m81 is actively interacting with m82 and ngc3077 : numerical models by @xcite provide an estimate of @xmath145yr for the most recent perigalacticon and it is conceivable that this interaction eventually set off a sequence of events which led to a phase of enhanced star formation @xmath146yr ago , leading to the current abundance of small , young holes .",

    "the relative number distribution of the characteristic energies required to create the holes is shown in fig .",

    "it is evident that nearly all distributions fall in a range that spans 3 orders of magnitude .",

    "this was first observed in holmbergii by @xcite and explained by @xcite and @xcite as follows . within @xmath1",
    "the disk in a dwarf is intrinsically thicker than in spirals ( see table  [ tbl - char ] ) which prevents holes from blowing out at an early stage .",
    "holes will therefore remain intrinsically spherical and the apparent axial ratio of an intrinsically spherical hole is not affected by the inclination of the host galaxy .",
    "holes in spiral galaxies will tend to break out of the disk , leaving an approximately circular feature in the plane of the galaxy which , when seen under an angle , will appear elliptical . as will be discussed below another possible explanation for this trend",
    "is the effect that shear plays on the appearance of holes .",
    "the trend that dwarf galaxies tend to have rounder holes on average is also evident in figure  [ fig : axial - d ] which presents the axial ratio vs.  the diameter of the holes .",
    "the last panel in this figure shows the entire sample of holes from which can be seen that there are few , if any , round holes larger than 1 kpc . for holes smaller than 1 kpc we see that the axial ratio takes the whole range of values indicative of the different factors that determine the axial ratio .",

    "the last term in equation 18 is zero for a flat rotation curve ( @xmath159 ) . using the rotation curves of galaxies ( where applicable ) we calculated values for shear between points separated by @xmath160 as illustrated in fig .",

    "the shear gradient is typically 1050 kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 , the upper boundary being typical for sa galaxies , later types reaching half this value .",
    "this is enough to turn an originally circular structure of 500 pc diameter , into an elliptical feature with axial ratio of @xmath161 within 50 myr .",
    "the range in shear gradient listed is what one expects to find between the outer and inner regions of a spiral galaxy , the inner regions having the highest values ( not considering the very inner solid body part ) .",
    "most dwarf galaxies are dominated by solid body rotation , so shear is absent . one would therefore navely expect holes at larger radii to be rounder than holes at smaller radii .",
    "however no such trend is apparent in the galaxies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : axial - rgc ] .",
    "this null result does not imply , though , that shear is not important in spirals .",

    "one would therefore expect a relation of axial ratio with kinetic age in the sense that on average older holes in shear dominated , i.e. , spiral galaxies , are less round than younger ones @xcite .",
    "this is investigated in the next figure , fig .",
    "[ fig : t - axial ] . except for some of the dwarf galaxies , where shear is not that important , only 5% of holes older than 50 myr are round ( average axial ratio is 0.70 ) . in the case of younger holes , the entire range of axial ratio is found , as expected , as one gets a mix of young , round holes in low shear environments with elliptical ones that find themselves in regions of high shear .",
    "the destructive role of shear is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shear - d ] where the diameter of holes is plotted against shear for galaxies for which it could be measured",

    "the axial ratio of those holes which have blown out and those that have lost their initial spherical shape due to shear depends crucially on viewing angle .",
    "the inclination should cause the major axis of holes to be aligned with the major axis of the disk .",
    "we also know that holes do not live in isolation and that two neighbouring spherical holes can merge to form a larger elliptical one",

    "one would therefore expect holes to be able to grow to larger diameters before breaking out and subsequently stalling , considering that the ambient density also drops with radius",
    ". the lack of finding a corresponding trend in the diameters of holes could be due to a variety of factors , one being that there is a growing incompleteness of finding holes in the very low surface brightness outer regions of spirals .",
    "alternatively , we know that star formation is inefficient at large radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consequently the number of stars more massive than 8 m@xmath163 which are formed cospatially decreases , reducing the total energy deposited after their demise as supernovae , resulting in holes of more modest diameter .",
    "another possible explanation is that the ambient density drops significantly perpendicular to the disk of the galaxy and therefore holes will tend to be elongated in this direction .",
    "consequently , even though these chimney  like structures will be intrinsically larger in the direction perpendicular to the disk , when viewed inclined , they might appear to have a lower ellipticity and mimic spherical features .",

    "further analysis showed that in all galaxies , apart from ngc4214 , the average energy requirement is higher for holes lying within @xmath1 ( @xmath166 ) than for those outside this radius ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the external pressure is higher within @xmath1 .",
    "first of all the gas density is higher near the center , as can be verified in the paper by @xcite .",
    "secondly , the sfr is higher in the central regions than in the outskirts which translates into more holes being created ( cf . , fig .",
    "[ fig : nperkpc2 ] ) , increasing the velocity dispersion and hence pressure of the gas .",
    "we also investigated the following relations , but there do not seem to be any trends of expansion velocity with either of axial ratio , displaced mass , energy required to produce the hole , or with galactocentric radius . neither is there any relation linking kinetic age with position from the center in a galaxy .      as was mentioned earlier , we selected 20 galaxies out of the 34 available .",
    "we ensured that we had 2 galaxies per hubble type . within each hubble type",
    ", we tried to select galaxies which differed in some property , such as sfr , to explore as wide a parameter space as possible .",
    "if we look at the distribution of the kinetic age of the holes across the sample , we find a trend which becomes more obvious if we group the galaxies in terms of early - type , late - type and dwarf galaxies as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eld ] . the mean kinetic age shifts towards higher values when we move from early  type spirals ( @xmath168 ) to late  type ( @xmath169 ) to dwarf galaxies ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the kinetic age is driven by the diameter distribution , as the expansion velocities cover a limited range , as mentioned earlier .",
    "disks of earlier type spirals present shear and spiral density waves , both mechanisms actively rearranging the gas within the disks and limiting the time an hole may survive . dwarf irregulars",
    "lack both shear and spiral arms . in spiral galaxies where shear is strong ( ngc2976 , ngc3031 , ngc3627 , and ngc4736 ) the maximum kinetic age is observed to be 40myr in contrast to the dwarf galaxies where we find holes of up to 140myr .",
    "overall the kinetic age ranges from 10 to 140myr , the upper limit reflecting the fact that holes would blend and possibly be destroyed after one full rotation of the disk .",
    "a second explanation for the observed trend is the same argument that applies as used when discussing fig .",
    "[ fig : axial ] , namely that the scaleheights of the disks in early  type spirals are small in comparison with those in dirrs which means that shells will break out of the disk sooner in the former and the remnant shell will stall , leading to holes in spirals having on average smaller diameters , hence leading to systematically lower age estimates .    in order to make this analysis more quantitative we decided to split the sample up in spiral and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the subsamples consist of 12 and 7 members , respectively , with a total of 831 versus 183 holes .",
    "the comparison between the subsamples was carried out via mann - whitney ( m  w ) and kolmogorov - smirnov ( k  s ) tests .",
    "both are non  parametric tests for assessing whether two samples can be drawn from the same parent distribution based on differences in the location of the medians ( m  w ) and differences in the shape of the two distributions ( k  s ) . in order to accept or reject a hypothesis we took a 3sigma level as the minimum significance level on both tests . in the following",
    "we compare the two subsamples of spirals and dwarfs in graphical form .",
    "the results of the m  w and k  s tests are summarised in table  [ stats ] .",
    "[ fig : dwarf - spirals]a shows the difference in the distribution of diameters of the holes between dwarf and spiral galaxies .",
    "it appears that dwarf galaxies have larger holes on average than spiral galaxies .",
    "a mann - whitney test confirms this as well .",
    "this is of course not surprising in the light of the current discussion .",
    "what is surprising is that dwarf galaxies appear to have fewer small holes ( @xmath171 pc ) even though the spatial resolution is better on average .",
    "this can be understood by realising that whereas star formation is a continuous process in spiral galaxies , it tends to occur in bursts in dwarfs .",
    "the time between bursts is longer than the duration of the star formation episodes ( e.g. , @xcite ) so it is likely that the dwarf galaxies whose ism is currently riddled with holes are in a post  starburst phase .",
    "there will therefore be a relative lack of small holes , most holes having had the time to grow to typically @xmath172 pc and beyond .    in this comparative analysis we included all holes .",
    "however , the galaxies are spread over distances which cover a factor of @xmath173 between the closest and most distant one ( in addition , the angular resolution varies slightly across the sample ) .",
    "therefore , small holes in those galaxies that are further away will escape detection .",
    "if we exclude ngc2841 and ngc3521 from our sample then for the rest of the galaxies there is a minimum common spatial resolution of 280 pc , i.e. we should have a complete sample of holes larger than 280 pc in 17 galaxies .",

    "[ fig : dwarf - spirals]c , shows a clear differentiation in the distribution of the two types of galaxies ( k  s test ) .",
    "holes in spiral galaxies appear to be significantly more energetic . based on the way the energy is derived",
    "this difference could be due to the fact that holes in spiral galaxies are intrinsically more energetic , for example because ob associations in spirals are more massive .",

    "the spatial distribution of the holes appears to be dependent on the type of the host galaxy as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwarf - spirals]e . in spiral galaxies holes appear to be concentrated within a smaller area of the disk , whereas in dwarf galaxies holes are distributed over a larger area .",
    "this is confirmed by a mann - whitney test . even though the difference between the two distributions is subtle the result",
    "can be understood as being due to the fact that star formation in spiral galaxies mostly happens in the spiral arms which are located within the @xmath1 radius . in dwarf galaxies star formation",
    "is spread across the entire disk .    to investigate this",
    "further we divided our sample of holes based on @xmath1 , i.e. , holes located inside and outside of this radius .",

    "[ fig : inoutr25]a and b. this is confirmed by the relevant mann - whitney test .",
    "this is in agreement with holes outside @xmath1 being less affected by processes such as shear .",
    "when we look at the sample of holes larger than 280 pc no significant differences are found in the diameter and kinetic age distributions within and outside @xmath1 .",
    "there is no discernible difference in expansion velocity ( fig .",

    "this holds true even when we break down our sample according to galaxy type ( dwarf or spiral ) .",
    "given that the diameter and expansion velocity distributions are similar in these two regions we conclude that this is driven by the difference in volume density .    regarding the types of the holes we found that in spiral galaxies there are more partially and fully contained holes ( type 2 and 3 ) within @xmath1 ( fig .",

    "we detected 104 holes in its layer , with diameters ranging from 0.24 kpc ( the resolution limit ) to 2 kpc .",
    "only a small fraction of these holes are type 3 ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "several supershells were detected , however 4 cases ( holes number 24 , 45 , 47 and 99 ) are probably superpositions of 2 or more holes .",
    "ngc2366 is a dwarf galaxy member of the m81 group .",
    "it is considered to be a typical irregular galaxy and is characterized by a supergiant complex ( ngc2363 ) in the southwest @xcite .",
    "we detected 26 holes in ngc2366 but since this is a highly inclined system ( @xmath256 ) we might be missing out on some features .",
    "all of the detected holes appear to be relatively young as their kinetic age was found to be between 638 myr . in a previous study @xcite searched for but did not detect any holes , however their spatial resolution was @xmath257 pc , almost 2.5 times worse than our resolution .",
    "another member of the m81 group , ngc2403 , is a late - type spiral galaxy located at a distance of 3.2 mpc .",
    "it has previously been studied by @xcite and by @xcite using an automated object recognition package who detected 50 and 601 holes respectively .",
    "even though this galaxy is highly inclined ( @xmath258 ) , its close proximity and good resolution allowed us to detect 173 holes in its distribution .",
    "a few supershells were detected but the majority ( 81% ) of the holes are smaller than 350 pc in diameter and younger than 20 myr .",
    "there are also several special cases : some of the holes are most likely a superposition of two or more holes ( holes number 51 , 157 and 173 ) ; holes number 10 , 43 have a peculiar signature in _ pv _ space .",
    "holmbergii is a gas - rich dwarf galaxy located at a distance of 3.4 mpc and is a member of the m81 group of galaxies as well .",
    "an hole analysis was carried out by @xcite in which they found 51 holes across the entire face of this galaxy .",
    "we detected 39 holes in holmbergii the majority of which were also detected by @xcite , all with very good agreement with respect to the position and size of the holes .",
    "the difference in the number of holes detected is due to our strict criteria of what constitutes a genuine hole as well as to the fact that several holes in our catalog were classified as a superposition of two ( or more ) holes from the puche et al . catalog .",
    "as figure  [ hoii - map ] illustrates , these holes dominate the distribution of holmbergii .",
    "in addition several supershells were detected , the largest one ( no 17 ) being over 2 kpc , one of the largest and oldest ( @xmath259 myr ) across the entire sample of holes .",
    "note that hole no 37 is probably a superposition of two or more holes .",
    "the dwarf irregular galaxy ddo53 lies at a distance of 3.6 mpc and also belongs to the m81 group .",
    "it is the smallest galaxy in our sample with an radius of only 2 kpc .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that we detected only 3 holes in its distribution , one of each type , with diameters in the range of 180 - 360 pc .",
    "ngc2841 is an early - type sc spiral and is the most distant galaxy in our sample located at 14.1 mpc .",
    "the limited spatial resolution and the high inclination of this galaxy meant that we were only able to detect supershells of type 1 .",
    "we found 15 holes and only one of these shows signs of expansion ( number 10 ) .",
    "in addition , holes number 4 , 12 and 13 are possibly superpositions of holes . hole no 5 is probably not a genuine hole but the result of the warp in the disk .",
    "holmbergi is a dwarf irregular galaxy which forms part of the m81 group of galaxies .",
    "its distribution is dominated by a supergiant shell as was noted by @xcite which does not coincide with the kinetic centre of the galaxy .",
    "we detected 6 holes in this galaxy including the one detected by @xcite .",
    "there is good agreement with respect to the position of this hole between both studies .",
    "the dwarf galaxy ngc2976 is located at 3.6 mpc and belongs to the m81 group of galaxies . in ngc2976",
    "we found only 10 holes , which is not surprising given that this is one of the smallest galaxies in our sample with an disk radius of @xmath260 .",
    "no supershells were detected .",
    "ngc3031 , also known as m81 , is a grand design spiral galaxy located at a distance of 3.6 mpc .",
    "the analysis of ngc3031 revealed 321 holes , the largest number of holes detected in any of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "this is due to various factors such as its relatively large size , close proximity and high spatial resolution of the observations .",
    "we were able to detect holes down to @xmath261 pc which led to the detection of a wealth of small holes ; almost 90% of the total holes detected have a size less than 200 pc .",
    "only a handful of supershells were detected .",
    "the mean kinetic age is 7.8 myr with 80% of the holes being younger than 9 myr .",
    "several features detected ( holes no : 34 , 72 , 88 , 93 , 94 , 97 , 99 , 102 , 106 , 109 , 113 , 114 , 170 , 255 and 273 ) are probably not genuine holes but the result of the warp in the disk . due to its large angular size",
    ", m81 was divided into 6 areas ( figures  [ m81-areas ]   [ m81-sw ] ) to be able to show all detected holes .",
    "ngc3184 is a spiral galaxy located at @xmath262 mpc and is viewed almost face - on .",
    "its analysis revealed 40 holes , the majority of those being supershells ( 80% ) .",
    "this could be attributed to the large distance of this galaxy which only allowed us to detect holes with diameters larger than 400 pc .",
    "we failed to detect any type 3 holes something which is expected since the scale height of the disk was found to be 250 pc , significantly smaller than our spatial resolution .",
    "nevertheless , this is the largest number of supershells detected in any one galaxy . the mean kinetic age of the holes is also high ( @xmath263 myr ) .",
    "note that hole number 13 is a superposition of 2 holes .",
    "another nearby ( @xmath264 mpc ) dwarf galaxy member of the m81 group , ic2574 hosts a relatively large number of holes @xcite . one particular hole ( our hole no 21 ) has been extensively studied at different wavelengths from radio to x  ray ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies showed that there is a remnant star cluster in the center of this hole and revealed evidence of propagating star formation along its rim . here",
    "we report on 29 holes compared to 48 holes detected by @xcite and 22 detected by @xcite the largest one being larger than 2 kpc in diameter .",
    "almost all of the 29 holes we present here have been detected by @xcite .",
    "the difference in the total number of holes detected is due to the strict criteria we used to classify a structure as a genuine hole .",
    "almost half of the holes ( 45% ) show signs of expansion .      another distant galaxy in our sample ,",
    "ngc3521 is a spiral galaxy with a prominent bar located at a distance of 10.7 mpc and viewed almost edge - on ( @xmath265 ) .",
    "the analysis of ngc3521 revealed 13 holes in the distribution .",
    "the small number of holes detected and the lack of type 3 holes can be attributed to the large distance of this galaxy as well as its high inclination .",
    "all of the holes detected were consequently classified as supershells .",
    "ngc3627 is a spiral galaxy at an adopted distance of @xmath266 mpc and is a member of the leo triplet .",
    "its high inclination ( @xmath267 ) meant we were only able to detect 18 holes in ngc3627 , two of them being type 3 .",
    "one holes worth noting is 7 which has unusually high expansion velocities of 65 kms@xmath6 respectively , the highest observed in the entire sample .",
    "ngc4214 is a nearby ( @xmath268 mpc ) dwarf irregular galaxy classified as a starburst galaxy .",
    "we found 56 holes in ngc4214 with a wide range of sizes , from 0.11 to 1.2 kpc .",
    "given the close proximity of this galaxy and consequently the high spatial resolution it is surprising that only about 7% of the holes detected are type 3 .",
    "one possible explanation is that ngc4214 has a low scale height and therefore holes can break out of the disk faster .      another dwarf irregular galaxy , ngc4449 , is located at a distance of @xmath269 mpc .",
    "it has a very extended structure reaching out to 6 times the holmberg radius .",
    "the @xmath94 radius for this galaxy was taken at the edge of the disk thus excluding this structure .",
    "what is also unusual about ngc4449 is that it has two counter ",
    "rotating gas systems @xcite .",
    "we detected 20 holes in ngc4449 , most of them located within @xmath1 and 6 located in the extended structure outside the @xmath94 radius .",
    "ngc4736 is a ringed spiral galaxy located at @xmath270 mpc in which we encountered 23 holes in its distribution .",
    "the range of their diameters is quite small ( 0.21 - 0.45 kpc ) and they are young holes ( @xmath271 myr ) . as figure  [ ngc4736-map ] illustrates , the majority of the holes are located at small galactocentric radii and only type 1 holes lie at larger galactocentric radii . finally note that hole number 11 is probably a superposition of 2 holes .",
    "the gas - rich dwarf galaxy ddo154 is a nearby galaxy with a very extended and warped disk .",
    "@xcite found 2 holes in the distribution which were also detected in our analysis .",
    "we report here on a total of 9 holes .",
    "the scale height of ddo154 was found to be @xmath272 500 pc which explains why holes can grow to a relatively large diameter before breaking out of the disk , as is the case with shell number 6 ( @xmath273 pc ) .",
    "ngc5194 is a grand - design spiral galaxy at a distance of @xmath274 mpc which is undergoing interaction with ngc5195 .",
    "we report 47 holes in ngc5194 with only one type 3 hole detected .",
    "most of holes are in fact supershells , with one of those ( no 5 ) being superposition of two or more holes .",
    "located at a distance of 5.9 mpc , ngc6946 is a large spiral galaxy seen almost face - on .",
    "previous studies by @xcite and @xcite revealed 19 and 121 holes respectively .",
    "we detected 56 holes , a subset of those detected by @xcite .",
    "there is excellent agreement for holes larger than 700 pc between our samples but not for smaller ones .",
    "this is due to the strict criteria ( @xmath100 ) we applied on holes whose size is comparable to the resolution limit .",
    "ngc6946 hosts the largest hole in our sample ( no 58 ) with a size of 2.1 kpc and energy requirements in excess of @xmath275 , which corresponds to @xmath276 sne .",
    "most of the holes detected ( 84% ) are type 1 , with two holes ( no 15 and 16 ) appearing as a superposition of more than one holes .",
    "a member of the sculptor group , ngc7793 is an sd spiral galaxy at @xmath277 mpc .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the properties of holes detected in 20 galaxies that are part of  the nearby galaxy survey \" ( things ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detected more than 1000 holes in total in the sampled galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> where they can be measured , their sizes range from about 100 pc ( our resolution limit ) to about 2kpc , their expansion velocities range from 4 to 36 @xmath0 , and their ages are estimated to range between 3 and 150myr . </S>",
    "<S> the holes are found throughout the disks of the galaxies , out to the edge of the disk ; 23% of the holes fall outside @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that shear limits the age of holes in spirals ( shear is less important in dwarf galaxies ) which explains why holes in dwarfs are rounder , on average than in spirals . </S>",
    "<S> shear , which is particularly strong in the inner part of spiral galaxies , also explains why we find that holes outside @xmath1 are larger and older . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the scale height of the disk as a function of galactocentric radius and find that the disk flares up in all galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to derive the surface and volume porosity ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and find that this correlates with the type of the host galaxy : later hubble types tend to be more porous .    </S>",
    "<S> the size distribution of the holes in our sample follows a power law with a slope of @xmath4 . assuming that the holes are the result of massive star formation , we derive values for the supernova rate ( snr ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) which scales with the sfr derived based on other tracers . </S>",
    "<S> if we extrapolate the observed number of holes to include those that fall below our resolution limit , down to holes created by a single supernova , we find that our results are compatible with the hypothesis that holes result from star formation . </S>"
