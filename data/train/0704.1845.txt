    "the extreme fine - tuning needed to keep the higgs mass small compared to the planck scale ( i.e. , the hierarchy puzzle ) has motivated many extensions of the minimal standard model .",
    "all of these contain new physics , beyond that in the minimal standard model , which might be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the most widely explored of these extensions is low energy supersymmetry . in this paper",
    "we introduce another extension of the standard model that solves the hierarchy puzzle .",
    "our approach builds on the work of lee and wick  @xcite who studied the possibility that the regulator propagator in pauli - villars corresponds to a physical degree of freedom .",
    "quantum electrodynamics with a photon propagator that includes the regulator term is a higher derivative version of qed .",
    "the higher derivative propagator contains two poles , one corresponding to the massless photon , and the other corresponding to a massive lee - wick - photon ( lw - photon ) .",
    "a problem with this approach is that the residue of the massive lw - photon pole has the wrong sign .",
    "lee and wick argued that one can make physical sense of such a theory .",
    "there is no problem with unitarity since the massive lw - photon is not in the spectrum ; it decays through its couplings to ordinary fermions .",
    "however , the wrong sign residue moves the poles in the photon two point function that are associated with this massive resonance from the second sheet to the physical sheet , introducing time dependence that grows exponentially .",
    "lee and wick and cutkosky _ et al . _",
    "@xcite propose a modification of the usual integration contour in feynman diagrams that removes this growth and preserves unitarity of the s matrix .",
    "this was further discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the theory of qed that lee and wick studied is finite . in this paper",
    "we propose to extend their idea to the standard model , removing the quadratic divergence associated with the higgs mass , and thus solving the hierarchy problem . in the lw - standard model ,",
    "every field in the minimal standard model has a higher derivative kinetic term that introduces a corresponding massive lw - resonance .",
    "these masses are additional free parameters in the theory and must be high enough to evade current experimental constraints . for the non - abelian gauge bosons the higher derivative kinetic term has , because of gauge invariance , new higher derivative interactions .",
    "hence the resulting theory is not finite ; however , we argue that it does not give rise to a quadratic divergence in the higgs mass , and so solves the hierarchy puzzle . a power counting argument and some explicit one loop calculations",
    "are given to demonstrate this .",
    "for explicit calculations , and to make the physics clearer , it is useful to remove the higher derivative terms in the lagrangian density by introducing auxiliary lw - fields that , when integrated out , reproduce the higher derivative terms in the action .",
    "the lw - standard model has a new parameter for each standard model field , which corresponds physically to the tree - level mass of its lw - partner resonance .",
    "explicit calculations can be performed in this theory at any order in perturbation theory , and the experimental consequences for physics at the lhc , and elsewhere , can be studied .",
    "the nonperturbative formulation of lee - wick theories has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "lee - wick theories are unusual ; however , even if one does not take the particular model we present as the correct theory of nature at the @xmath0 scale our work does suggest that a further examination of higher derivative theories is warranted . some previous work on field theories with non - local actions that contain terms with an infinite number of derivatives",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "to illustrate the physics of lee - wick theory  @xcite in a simple setting , we consider in this section a theory of one self - interacting scalar field , @xmath1 , with a higher derivative term .",
    "the lagrangian density is @xmath2 so the propagator of @xmath1 in momentum space is given by @xmath3 for @xmath4 , this propagator has poles at @xmath5 and also at @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the propagator describes more than one degree of freedom .",
    "we can make these new degrees of freedom manifest in the lagrangian density in a simple way .",
    "first , let us introduce an auxiliary scalar field @xmath7 , so that we can write the theory as @xmath8 since @xmath9 is quadratic in @xmath7 , the equations of motion of @xmath7 are exact at the quantum level .",
    "removing @xmath7 from @xmath9 with their equations of motion reproduces @xmath10 in eq .  .",
    "next , we define @xmath11 . in terms of this variable , the lagrangian in eq",
    ".   becomes , after integrating by parts , @xmath12 in this form , it is clear that there are two kinds of scalar field : a normal scalar field @xmath13 and a new field @xmath7 , which we will refer to as an lw - field .",
    "the sign of the quadratic lagrangian of the lw - field is opposite to the usual sign so one may worry about stability of the theory , even at the classical level .",
    "we will return to this point .",
    "if we neglect the mass @xmath14 for simplicity , the propagator of @xmath7 is given by @xmath15 the lw - field is associated with a non - positive definite norm on the hilbert space , as indicated by the unusual sign of its propagator .",
    "consequently , if this state were to be stable , unitarity of the @xmath16 matrix would be violated .",
    "however , as emphasized by lee and wick , unitarity is preserved provided that @xmath7 decays .",
    "this occurs in the theory described by eq .   because @xmath7 is heavy and can decay to two @xmath13-particles .    in the presence of the mass @xmath14 ,",
    "there is mixing between the scalar field @xmath13 and the lw - scalar @xmath7 .",
    "we can diagonalize this mixing without spoiling the diagonal form of the derivative terms by performing a symplectic rotation on the fields : @xmath17 this transformation diagonalizes the lagrangian if @xmath18 a solution for the angle @xmath19 exists provided @xmath20 .",
    "the lagrangian   describing the system becomes @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the masses of the diagonalized fields .",
    "notice the form of the interaction ; we can define @xmath24 and then drop the primes to obtain a convenient lagrangian for computation .",
    "so that @xmath25 . ]    introducing the lw - fields makes the physics of the theory clear .",
    "there are two fields ; the heavy lw - scalar decays to the lighter scalar . at loop level",
    ", the presence of the heavier scalar improves the convergence of loop graphs at high energy consistent with our expectations from the higher derivative form of the theory .",
    "we can use the familiar technology of perturbative quantum field theory ( appropriately modified  @xcite ) to compute quantum corrections to the physics .",
    "it is worth pausing for a moment to consider loop corrections to the two point function of the lw - field . using the one loop self energy , the full propagator for the lw - scalar",
    "is given , near @xmath26 , by @xmath27 note that , unlike for ordinary scalars , there is a plus sign in front of the self energy @xmath28 in the denominator .",
    "this sign is significant ; for example , if one defines the width in the usual way ( i.e. , near the pole the propagator has denominator @xmath29 ) then , from a one loop computation of the self energy @xmath30 , the width of the lw - field is ( for i m @xmath31 ) @xmath32 this width differs in sign from widths of the usual particles we encounter . with this result in hand",
    ", we can demonstrate how unitarity of the theory is maintained in an explicit example .",
    "consider @xmath33 scattering in this theory . from unitarity ,",
    "the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude , @xmath34 , must be a positive quantity .",
    "near @xmath26 , the scattering is dominated by the @xmath7 pole and therefore the imaginary part of the amplitude is given for i m @xmath31 by @xmath35 the unusual sign of the propagator is compensated by the unusual sign of the decay width .",
    "as another consequence of this sign , the poles associated with these lw - particles occur on the physical sheet of the analytic continuation of the @xmath16 matrix , in violation of the usual rules of @xmath16 matrix theory .",
    "these signs are also associated with exponential growth of disturbances , which is related to the stability concerns alluded to earlier .",
    "lee and wick , and cutkowsky _ et al _ argued that one can nevertheless make sense of these theories by modifying the usual contour prescription for momentum integrals .",
    "the feynman @xmath36 prescription can be thought of as a deformation of the contour such that the poles on the real axis are appropriately above or below the contour .",
    "the lee - wick prescription is equivalent to imposing the boundary condition that there are no outgoing exponentially growing modes .",
    "it is well known that such future boundary conditions cause violations of causality . in the lee - wick theory",
    "the acausal effects occur only on microscopic scales , and show up as a peculiar time ordering of events ; for example , the decay products of a lee - wick particle appear at times before the lee - wick particle itself is created .",
    "it is believed that this theory does not produce violations of causality , or any paradoxes , on a macroscopic scale  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider a scalar in the fundamental representation interacting with gauge bosons .",
    "we find the lagrange density for the lw version of such a theory and show by power counting appropriate to the higher derivative version of the theory that the scalar mass is free of quadratic divergences .",
    "we then show by an explicit one loop calculation that the ordinary scalar and the massive lw - fields do not receive a quadratically divergent contribution to their pole masses .",
    "the higher derivative lagrangian in the gauge sector is @xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] , and @xmath39 with @xmath40 the generators of the gauge group @xmath41 in the fundamental representation .",
    "we can now eliminate the higher derivative term by introducing auxiliary massive gauge bosons @xmath42 .",
    "each gauge boson is described by a lagrangian @xmath43 where @xmath44 $ ] . to diagonalize the kinetic terms , we introduce shifted fields defined by @xmath45 the lagrangian becomes @xmath46 f^{\\mu \\nu } \\right )   \\\\ -\\frac{3}{2 } g^2 \\operatorname{tr}\\left ( \\left [ \\tilde a_\\mu , \\tilde a_\\nu \\right ]   \\left [ \\tilde a^\\mu , \\tilde a^\\nu \\right ] \\right ) - 4 i g \\operatorname{tr}\\left ( \\left [ \\tilde a_\\mu , \\tilde a_\\nu \\right ] d^\\mu \\tilde a^\\nu \\right ) - m_a^2 \\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\tilde a_\\mu \\tilde a^\\mu \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : gblwlag}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that for a @xmath47 gauge boson all the commutators vanish , there are no traces and an extra overall factor of @xmath48 .    to perform perturbative calculations , we must introduce a gauge fixing term .",
    "we could introduce such a term in the higher derivative lagrangian , eq .  , in terms of the lagrangian involving @xmath49 and @xmath42 , eq .  , or even in the lagrangian with mixed kinetic terms for @xmath50 and @xmath42 , eq .  .",
    "as is usual in gauge theories , all of these choices will yield the same results for physical quantities , but they may differ for unphysical quantities .",
    "different gauge choices can differ on how divergent unphysical quantities are .",
    "therefore , we will only compute physical pole masses below . in these computations ,",
    "we introduce a covariant gauge fixing term for the gauge bosons , @xmath51 , in the two field description of the theory given in eq .  .",
    "in this choice of gauge , the propagator for the gauge bosons is given by @xmath52 while the propagator for the lw - gauge field is @xmath53      let us move on to consider scalar matter transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group . in ordinary field theory ,",
    "such a scalar field has a quadratic divergence in its pole mass .",
    "the higher derivative lagrangian is given in terms of the scalar field @xmath1 by @xmath54 we eliminate the higher derivative term by introducing an lw - scalar multiplet @xmath7 . then the lagrangian is given in terms of the two fields @xmath1 and @xmath7 by @xmath55 where the covariant derivative is @xmath56 for simplicity we take the ordinary scalar to have no potential at tree level , @xmath57 .",
    "it is not hard to include a potential for @xmath1 in the analysis , and to show that the potential does not change our results .",
    "we diagonalized the pure gauge sector by shifting the gauge fields ; in terms of the shifted gauge fields the hatted covariant derivative is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the usual covariant derivative . to diagonalize the scalar kinetic terms",
    ", we again shift the field @xmath60 the scalar lagrangian becomes @xmath61      having defined the higher derivative and lw forms of the theory , we present a power counting argument for the higher derivative version of the theory which indicates that the only physical divergences in the theory are logarithmic . since the power counting argument depends on the behaviour of feynman graphs at high energies , we only need to consider the terms in the lagrangian which are most important at high energies .    for the perturbative power counting argument in the higher derivative theory",
    ", it is necessary to fix the gauge .",
    "we choose to add a covariant gauge fixing term @xmath62 to the lagrange density and introduce faddeev - popov ghosts that couple to the gauge bosons in the usual way .",
    "then the propagator for the gauge field is @xmath63 we work in @xmath64 gauge .",
    "note that @xmath64 corresponds to landau gauge and that the gauge boson propagator scales as @xmath65 at high energy .",
    "the propagator for the scalar in the fundamental representation is @xmath66 at large momenta the scalar propagator scales as @xmath65 while the faddeev - popov ghost propagator scales as @xmath67 , as usual .",
    "there are three kinds of vertices : those where only gauge bosons interact , vertices where gauge bosons interact with two scalars , and vertices where two ghosts interact with one gauge boson .",
    "a vertex where @xmath68 vectors interact ( with no scalars ) scales as @xmath69 while a vertex with two scalars and @xmath68 vectors scales as @xmath70 .",
    "the vertex between two ghosts and one gauge field scales as one power of @xmath71 , as usual .",
    "consider an arbitrary feynman graph with @xmath72 loops , @xmath73 internal vector lines , @xmath74 internal scalar lines , @xmath75 internal ghost lines , and with @xmath76 or @xmath77 vertices with @xmath68 vectors and zero or two scalar particles , respectively .",
    "we also suppose there are @xmath78 ghost vertices .",
    "then the superficial degree of divergence , @xmath79 , is @xmath80 we can simplify this expression using some identities .",
    "first , the number of loops is related to the total number of propagators and vertices by @xmath81 while the total number of lines entering or leaving the vertices is related to the number of propagators and external lines by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of external scalars , @xmath84 is the number of external vectors , and @xmath85 is the number of external ghosts . finally , because the lagrangian is quadratic in the number of scalars and ghosts , the number of scalar lines and ghost lines is separately conserved .",
    "thus , @xmath86 with these identities in hand , we may express the superficial degree of divergence as @xmath87 gauge invariance removes the potential quadratic divergence in the gauge boson two point function .",
    "scalar mass renormalizations have @xmath88 , so that @xmath89 .",
    "consequently , the only possible quadratic divergence in the scalar mass is at one loop .",
    "however , gauge invariance also removes the divergence in the scalar mass renormalization , because two of the derivatives must act on the external legs . to see this , note that the interaction involves @xmath90 since we are working in lorentz gauge , @xmath91 .",
    "we may ignore the @xmath92 term compared to the @xmath93 term , as it is less divergent .",
    "thus the most divergent terms in the interaction are @xmath94 or @xmath95 , where the @xmath13 acted on by the derivatives is an internal line .",
    "but by integration by parts and use of the gauge condition , we see that , at one loop , we can always take one of the derivatives to act on the external scalar .",
    "thus the theory at hand is at most logarithmically divergent .",
    "the power counting argument above was presented in the higher derivative version of the theory . as a check of the formalism",
    "we show , in the lw version of the theory , that the shift in the pole masses of the ordinary scalar , the lw - scalar and the lw - gauge boson do not receive quadratically divergent contributions at one loop .",
    "it is important to compute a physical quantity since it is for these that the higher derivative theory and the theory with lw - fields give equivalent results .",
    "we perform the computations in feynman gauge , using the propagators in eqs .   and  , and regulate our diagrams where necessary using dimensional regularization with dimension @xmath68 .          at one loop , there are four graphs contributing to the scalar mass , as shown in figure  [ fig : normscalar ] .",

    "however these cancel .",
    "there is also a quartic divergence in diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) that cancels between them . to check that the quadratic divergence cancels we regulate the diagrams with dimensional regularization . in @xmath68 dimensions ,",
    "a quadratic divergence manifests itself as a pole at @xmath101 .",

    "one might think that this graph could introduce a quadratic divergence of the lw - gauge boson mass .",
    "however , the vertices between the fermions and the gauge bosons are equal to the vertices between the fermions and the lw - gauge bosons , as can be seen in eq .",

    "<S> we construct a modification of the standard model which stabilizes the higgs mass against quadratically divergent radiative corrections , using ideas originally discussed by lee and wick in the context of a finite theory of quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian includes new higher derivative operators . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the higher derivative terms can be eliminated by introducing a set of auxiliary fields ; this allows for convenient computation and makes the physical interpretation more transparent . </S>",
    "<S> although the theory is unitary , it does not satisfy the usual analyticity conditions . </S>"
