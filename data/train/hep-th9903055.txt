    "the general theory of relativity can be viewed as a theory for a self - interacting massless spin-@xmath2 field .",
    "this theory of gravity is derived from the einstein - hilbert ( e - h ) lagrangian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ricci scalar and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is newton s gravitational constant ) .",
    "it is convenient to work with goldberg variables  @xcite @xmath7 which one expands in an asymptotically flat geometry @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the metric of minkowski spacetime . then ( [ eq : einstein - hilbert - lagrangefunktion ] ) becomes an infinite power series in @xmath10 : @xmath11 the lowest order term @xmath12 is quadratic in @xmath13 and defines the free asymptotic fields . in the hilbert - gauge @xmath14 , the graviton field @xmath15 obeys the wave equation @xmath16 the first order term @xmath17 gives the trilinear coupling @xmath18    there exists many alternative derivations of this result ( [ eq : klassische - einstein - hilbert - lagrangefunktion ] ) , starting from massless tensor fields and requiring consistency with gauge invariance in some sense  @xcite .",
    "in classical theory the work closest to our non - geometrical point of view is the one of ogievetsky and polubarinov  @xcite .",
    "these authors analyze spin-@xmath2 theories by working with a generalized hilbert - gauge condition to exclude the spin one part from the outset .",
    "they impose an invariance under infinitesimal gauge transformations of the form @xmath19 and get einstein s theory at the end . instead wyss  @xcite and deser  @xcite consider the coupling to matter .",
    "then the self - coupling of the tensor - field ( [ eq : klassische - einstein - hilbert - lagrangefunktion ] ) is necessary for consistency .",
    "wald  @xcite derives a divergence identity which is equivalent to an infinitesimal gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "einstein s theory is the only non - trivial solution of this identity . in quantum theory",
    "the problem was studied by boulware and deser  @xcite .",
    "these authors implement gauge invariance by requireing ward identities associated with the graviton propagator .",
    "all authors get einstein s theory as the unique classical limit if the theory is purely spin two without a spin one admixture .",
    "in this paper we shall study the problem by means of perturbative quantum gauge invariance .",
    "this method which was worked out for spin-1 non - abelian gauge theories ( massless  @xcite and massive  @xcite ) in last years proceeds as follows : first one defines infinitesimal gauge variations on free fields . in the case of tensor",
    "fields it looks like ( [ eq : klassische - eichinvarianz ] ) where @xmath20 , instead of being an arbitrary function , is now a fermi field which satisfies the wave equation .",
    "@xmath20 may be regarded as a free fadeev - popov ghost field .",
    "then we write down the most general trilinear coupling @xmath21 between the graviton and ghost fields which is compatible with lorentz covariance , power counting and certain basic properties ( like zero ghost number ) .",
    "next we impose first order gauge invariance which strongly restricts the form of @xmath21 . among the possible solutions",
    "we recover einstein s theory @xmath17 .",
    "the general solution can be written as a linear combination of @xmath17 and divergences as well as coboundaries . in the perturbative construction of the @xmath0-matrix we next have to calculate the time - ordered product @xmath22 by means of causality  @xcite .",
    "then schorn  @xcite has shown that second order gauge invariance gives further restrictions , in particular , in the case of gravity it requires quartic normalisation terms of the form @xmath23 in the above expansion ( [ eq : entwicklung - einstein - hilbert - lagrangefunktion ] ) . in this way the so - called proliferation of couplings can be overcome by perturbative gauge invariance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce perturbative gauge invariance . in section three",
    "we set up the general theory of a symmetrical tensor field by writing down all possible trilinear self - couplings and the most general ghost - coupling .",
    "in the following sections the consequences of first order gauge invariance are analysed",
    ". we obtain @xmath24 important conditions for spin-@xmath2 gauge theories .",
    "these conditions are necessary and sufficient for first order gauge invariance .",
    "our fundamental free asymptotic fields are a symmetric tensor field of rank two @xmath13 and ghost and anti - ghost fields @xmath20 and @xmath25 .",
    "we consider these fields in the background of minkowski spacetime .",
    "a symmetrical tensor field has ten degrees of freedom , which are more than the five independent components of a spin-@xmath2 field .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom can be eliminated by imposing two further conditions  @xcite , namely @xmath26 they are disregarded in the construction of the gauge theory and must be considered later in the characterization of physical states  @xcite .",
    "our tensor field @xmath13 will be quantised as a massless field as follows @xmath27=-ib^{{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\mu\\nu}d_0(x - y )    \\label{eq : h - quantisierung}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the massless pauli - jordan distribution and the tensor @xmath29 is constructed from the minkowski metric @xmath9 in the following way @xmath30 in analogy to spin-@xmath31 theories one introduces a gauge charge operator by @xmath32 for the construction of the physical subspace and in order to prove the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix we want to have a nilpotent operator @xmath1 .",
    "therefore we have to quantise the ghost fields with anticommutators @xmath33 and all other anti - commutators vanishing .",
    "all asymptotic fields fulfil the wave equation @xmath34 the gauge charge @xmath1 ( [ eq : q ] ) defines a gauge variation by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ghostnumber .",
    "this is the number of ghost fields minus the number of anti - ghost fields in the wick monomial @xmath37 .",
    "the operator @xmath38 obeys the leibniz rule @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary operators .",
    "we obtain the following gauge variations of the fundamental fields : @xmath42 from ( [ eq : eichvariation - h - tensor ] ) we immediately see @xmath43 the result ( [ eq : eichvariation - h - tensor ] ) agrees with the infinitesimal gauge transformations of the goldberg variables , so that our choice of @xmath1 corresponds to the classical framework described in the introduction .",
    "the asymptotic fields will be used to construct the time - ordered products @xmath44 in the adiabatically switched @xmath0-matrix @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a test function .",
    "the time ordered products @xmath44 are operator valued distributions and can be expressed by normally ordered products of free fields .",
    "it is very important that gauge invariance of the @xmath0-matrix can be directly formulated in terms of the @xmath44 .",
    "first order gauge invariance means that @xmath47 is a divergence in the sense of vector analysis , i.e. @xmath48 the definition of the @xmath49-th order gauge invariance then reads @xmath50=i\\sum_{l=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\mu}_l}t_{n / l}^{\\mu}(x_1,\\ldots , x_l,\\ldots , x_n )    \\label{eq : eichinvarianz - n.te - ordnung}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 is the time ordered product with a gauge variated vertex @xmath52 at position @xmath53 and ordinary vertices @xmath21 at the other arguments .",
    "here we introduce the self - couplings of the quantum tensor field .",
    "we consider for this purpose a symmetrical rank-@xmath2 tensor field in a fixed background , namely minkowski spacetime .",
    "the simplest expression leading to a self - interacting spin-@xmath2 field theory is a trilinear coupling of the quantum fields @xmath13 and @xmath54 .",
    "we require lorentz invariance and in addition to that two derivatives acting on the fields .",
    "this is for the following reasons : first of all , by inspection of all trilinear self - interaction terms without derivatives , it is easily seen that such a theory can not be gauge invariant to first order of perturbation theory .",
    "therefore an interaction without derivatives can be ruled out .",
    "secondly it is impossible to form a lorentz - scalar from three rank-@xmath2 tensor fields with only one derivative .",
    "last but not least the corresponding trilinear expression in the expansion the e - h action contains two derivatives as well",
    ". therefore we are able to reproduce the results from classical general relativity .    in the following all fields are free fields obeying the free field equations of motion .",
    "all products of two or more fields at the same spacetime point @xmath55 are viewed as normal products .",
    "then the general ansatz for a combination of three field operators contains @xmath56 terms .",
    "all indices will be raised and lowered by the minkowski - metric @xmath57 and will be properly contracted like @xmath58 . ] : @xmath59 here we have omitted all terms which are gauge invariant in a trivial way .",
    "these are terms with a contraction on the two derivatives , e.g. @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore all terms with two derivatives acting on the same field can be transformed into a divergence plus a term already contained in ( [ eq : t1h ] ) .",
    "these terms would modify our ansatz only in a redefinition of some parameters @xmath61 and can be omitted without losing generality .",
    "as in the cases of yang - mills theory  @xcite and einstein gravity  @xcite we expect to get a gauge invariant first order coupling only if we couple the tensor field @xmath15 to ghost and anti - ghost fields .",
    "the most general expression with zero ghost - number is @xmath62 we will suppress all arguments of the field operators as well as the double dots of normal ordering in subsequent expressions .",
    "the complete first order coupling is then given by : @xmath63 in the following analysis we are interested in the question how the parameters of the theory @xmath64 and @xmath65 will be restricted due to first order gauge invariance .",
    "in the previous section we have defined our trilinear coupling @xmath66 as well as the coupling to ghost- and anti - ghost fields @xmath67 . in this section",
    "we try to write the gauge variation @xmath47 as a divergence @xmath68 .",
    "we proceed in the following way : because of the great variety of different terms in @xmath47 it is most convenient to use a separate ansatz for @xmath69 . since the operator @xmath38 applied to our @xmath21 increases the ghostnumber of the result by one we have to make an ansatz with @xmath70 .",
    "the terms appearing in this ansatz can be classified according to their index structure regarding the tensor indices : there are seven different types of the form @xmath71 , namely    1 . )",
    "type @xmath40 : @xmath72    2 . )",

    "type @xmath78 : @xmath79    6 . )",
    "type @xmath37 : @xmath80    7 . ) type @xmath6 : @xmath81 the remaining ones are products of two ghost fields and one anti - ghost field .",
    "here we have three different types :    8 . )",
    "type @xmath82 : @xmath83    9 . )",
    "type @xmath84 : @xmath85    10 . )",
    "type @xmath86 : @xmath87 then we obtain the total divergence as the sum of these 10 different types @xmath88 the parameters @xmath89 are for the moment free constants , to be determined by gauge invariance .",
    "this expression is called @xmath1-vertex in the sequel because it is obtained from the usual vertex @xmath21 if one replaces a quantum field with the gauge variation of that field . ] for @xmath69 contains all possible combinations of fields appearing after gauge variation of @xmath21 . without losing generality",
    "one can now eliminate a few terms in the types @xmath90 and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore we consider a new @xmath1-vertex @xmath91 for which the following relation holds @xmath92 where @xmath93 has the special form @xmath94 and @xmath95 is an anti - symmetrical tensor of rank @xmath2 .",
    "then we have @xmath96 because partial derivatives are commuting .",
    "let us now construct such a tensor @xmath97 .",
    "we consider the type-@xmath40 term @xmath98 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath99    \\label{eq : c3-term}\\ ] ] in an analogous way and using the wave equation we can write @xmath100    \\label{eq : c3-term=0}\\ ] ] now we add @xmath101 to @xmath69 and obtain @xmath102 the expression in brackets is anti - symmetric in @xmath103 and we get @xmath104 if we replace the constants @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 with @xmath108 in @xmath69 . in this way we can eliminate the monomials with constants @xmath109 in type @xmath40 , @xmath110 in type @xmath41 , @xmath111 in type @xmath74 , @xmath112 in type @xmath76 , @xmath113 in type @xmath82 and @xmath114 in type @xmath86 .",
    "then we obtain a smaller @xmath1-vertex @xmath104 from @xmath69 if we replace @xmath115 by @xmath116 in the following we will always use this new @xmath1-vertex @xmath104 .",
    "after elimination of these redundant terms in the types @xmath90 and @xmath86 one can express the corresponding terms of @xmath47 in an unique way as a divergence in the sense of vector analysis .",
    "this is done in appendix a. for the types @xmath117 and @xmath84 the situation is a little different .",
    "here we have no monomial with two derivatives , one of which acting with respect to @xmath118 . for these types",
    "it is impossible to obtain an unique divergence for @xmath47 , see appendix b. nevertheless these types are important for the following , as we will see .",
    "let us look at type @xmath78 first .",
    "in this subsection we consider the type @xmath78 divergences explicitly . from the comparison of these divergences with @xmath119",
    "we will get linear relations among the coupling parameters of @xmath21 .",
    "we require the following equation to be satisfied @xmath120 calculating the right side of this equation we get @xmath121 the new constants are defined as follows @xmath122 from equation  ( [ eq : eichinvarianz - type ] ) we see that @xmath123 finally we arrive at the divergence form if we invert the system  ( [ eq : d - type ] ) .",
    "this is done in appendix b. let @xmath124 be the coefficient matrix of ( [ eq : d - type ] ) .",
    "then we can write this system of equations as @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the column vectors with components @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively .",
    "now we observe two things :    1 .   for a solution to exist",
    "it is necessary to fulfil @xmath130 2 .",
    "@xmath131    from 2 .",
    "we get the information that the representation of @xmath119 as a divergence is not unique .",
    "but the important results are the equations ( [ eq : type - d - relationen ] ) , because we obtain relations among the coupling parameters if we use ( [ eq : zuordnung - type ] ) : @xmath132 these equations are direct consequences of first order gauge invariance .      in analogy to the case of type @xmath78 we obtain linear relations among the coupling parameters from the types @xmath134 and @xmath84 .",
    "one finds the following @xmath135 relations @xmath136 together with the six relations from type @xmath78 ( [ eq : type - relation1][eq : type - relation6 ] ) we get @xmath24 independent equations which restrict the admissible theories . by construction",
    "these equations are necessary for a spin-@xmath2 theory to be gauge invariant .",
    "the gauge charge operator is by definition nilpotent @xmath137 . as a consequence",
    "the application of twice the gauge variation to every expression must vanish , i.e. @xmath138 if we now use the gauge invariance of @xmath21 to first order , we get additional constraints for the @xmath1-vertex @xmath69 , namely @xmath139 this equation gives us restrictions on the parameters of @xmath69 . after a lengthy calculation one arrives at exactly @xmath140 linear independent coefficients .",
    "the remaining ones can be expressed as linear combinations of them .",
    "one might think that these linear dependences may produce further necessary conditions beside the fifteen above .",
    "but this is not the case .",
    "the divergence expressions become larger if we restrict ourself to these @xmath140 independent parameters since terms of different types mix up . in view of this",
    "it is more convenient to work with the full @xmath141 different parameters but type by type separately .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : q2-bedingung ] ) is always satisfied as soon as gauge invariance to first order holds .",
    "the preceding section has shown what kind of restrictions we obtain if we require the theory to be gauge invariant .",
    "the @xmath24 equations ( [ eq : type - relation1][eq : rela15 ] ) we have found for the @xmath142 parameters @xmath143 as well as @xmath144 play a central role",
    ". now we can look at an arbitrary solution to this set of equations .",
    "the corresponding @xmath21 is then gauge invariant to first order because for the following reason .",
    "we have to write the gauge variation of this @xmath21 as a divergence in the sense of vector analysis .",
    "because of the generality of our ansatz for the @xmath1-vertex every term in @xmath47 can be uniquely identified with a @xmath145-monomial in @xmath104 . with the help of the equations from appendix a we can then find a unique divergence for the types @xmath146 and @xmath86 .",
    "for the other types we can also find a divergence but in this case it s no longer unique ( see appendix b ) .    summing up",
    "we have proven the following proposition    let @xmath21 and @xmath104 be given as above , furthermore let @xmath147 be the following mapping @xmath148 let @xmath149 be the space of solutions to ( [ eq : type - relation1][eq : rela15 ] ) .",
    "@xmath150 is an @xmath151-dimensional subspace of @xmath152 , which is characterised through the following injective linear mapping @xmath153 : @xmath154 then we have the two equivalent statements : @xmath155 where @xmath156 means the image of the linear mapping @xmath157 .",
    "this proposition determines all gauge invariant spin-@xmath2 theories up to first order of perturbation theory .",
    "one obtains the trilinear coupling in the expansion of the e - h action by @xmath158 .",
    "this has the explicit form : @xmath159    \\label{eq : einstein - hilbert - kopplung}\\ ] ] the ghost coupling turns out to be the one first suggested by kugo and ojima  @xcite , namely @xmath160    \\label{eq : kugo - ojima - kopplung}\\ ] ] from the viewpoint of gauge properties of a quantised tensor field we have obtained a set of @xmath151 linear independent gauge theories .",
    "we claim that these @xmath151 different theories together with all their linear combinations are physically equivalent ( in the sense explained below ) to the trilinear coupling of einstein - hilbert  ( [ eq : einstein - hilbert - kopplung ] ) plus the ghost coupling of kugo - ojima  ( [ eq : kugo - ojima - kopplung ] ) up to first order of perturbation theory .",
    "let @xmath161 be the projection from the hole fock - space @xmath162 onto the physical subspace @xmath163 , which can be expressed in terms of the kernel and the range of the gauge charge operator @xmath1 by @xmath164 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "then two @xmath0-matrices @xmath165 describe the same physics if all matrix elements between physical states agree in the adiabatic limit @xmath166 , i.e. @xmath167 for theories with massless fields the existence of the adiabatic limit is a problem . to avoid this",
    "we work with a perturbative version of ( [ eq : physikalische - aequivalenz ] ) : @xmath168 obviously ( [ eq : physikalische - aequivalenz : stoerungstheoretische - form ] ) for all @xmath49 implies ( [ eq : physikalische - aequivalenz ] ) if the adiabatic limit exists .",
    "specialising to first order @xmath169 we see that two couplings @xmath21 and @xmath170 which differ by a divergence are physically equivalent to first order .",
    "furthermore , if they differ by a coboundary , i.e. a term @xmath171 where @xmath172 has ghostnumber @xmath173 , they are also equivalent because of the equation @xmath174 since by inspection of ( [ eq : physikalischer - unterraum ] ) we have @xmath175    let us return to the space of solutions @xmath150 from proposition 1 .",
    "every vector in @xmath150 corresponds through the mapping @xmath176 to a gauge invariant theory to first order of perturbation theory .",
    "as was mentioned earlier the trilinear coupling of einstein - hilbert lies in this space .",
    "we now look at the other theories beside the e - h coupling . for this purpose",
    "we choose a suitable basis in @xmath150 .",
    "it turns out that a basis can be choosen which shows that all theories beside the classical e - h coupling consists of divergences and coboundaries only .",
    "then we have the following theorem .    up to first order of perturbation theory all gauge invariant trilinear self - couplings of a quantised tensor field @xmath13 are physically equivalent to the one obtained from the expansion of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian ( given by  ( [ eq : einstein - hilbert - kopplung ] ) without the two divergence terms , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of this proposition is given in appendix c.    now there arise two questions : 1 ) will the statement of this proposition remain true in higher orders ? to answer this question we have to show that in each order @xmath49 we can achieve the form @xmath177 where @xmath178 will be constructed from @xmath179 only .",
    "we are quite sure that this is indeed the case so the divergence- or coboundary contributions will have no physical effect .",
    "this will be further investigated in a forthcomming paper .",
    "\\2 ) what about the gauge invariance of the einstein - hilbert coupling in higher orders ? in  @xcite",
    "schorn obtained the result that the e - h coupling in combination with the kugo - ojima - coupling for the ghosts is gauge invariant to second order .",
    "there it was necessary to introduce normalisation terms which coincide with the four graviton coupling obtained from the expansion of the e - h lagrangian .",
    "higher than second order have not been investigated up to now .",
    "in this work we have given a detailed analysis of the gauge properties of a quantised tensor field .",
    "very strong restrictions on the admissible form of the interaction are obtained through the requirement of perturbative gauge invariance even in first order of perturbation theory . among all solutions to our set of equations",
    "only the e - h coupling remains as a physically relevant theory .",
    "this fact is very remarkable since in our approach only the gauge properties of a quantum field describing a spin-@xmath2 particle were considered and no use was made of any geometrical input from classical general relativity . in view of this and with the preceding work about yang - mills theories in mind we have seen that the principle of operator gauge invariance is a really universal .    in the future",
    "we will analyze the einstein - hilbert coupling in higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "first of all we will work out a proof of proposition 2 in higher orders which seems possible to us without to many difficulties .",
    "then we are interested in a detailed analysis of the second order gauge invariance for the e - h coupling .",
    "although this was already done by schorn who has found that the second order is indeed gauge invariant , we hope that we can give a more straightforward proof of this result which can be generalized to higher orders .",
